Her sister-in-law, Melanie, pounded her on the back. \u201cCough it up!\u201d</p><p>With the way Melanie was hitting her, Zoe would be lucky if all she coughed up was water. \u201cStop,\u201d she gasped before leveling her sister-in-law with a quasi-stern look. \u201cThat\u2019s your advice: get laid? This conversation is quickly going the way of clich\u00e9d romance novel opening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>Zoe glanced up at the ceiling, then back at Melanie. \u201cIt\u2019s not, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I at least get a name first, or maybe something even crazier like dinner?\u201d</p><p>A smile touched Melanie\u2019s lips. \u201cWell, you could gamble at the blackjack table first and hope that a hot guy would show up to teach you the finer points of betting.\u201d</p> <p>Zoe snorted. That was her sister-in-law\u2019s response to everything. Okay, so maybe not to get laid or go gambling. But to do something outrageous. Well, outrageous to everyone who wasn\u2019t Melanie. \u201cI\u2019m already taking a gamble with my luggage getting lost since I have about five thousand layovers. And don\u2019t even get me started on earthquakes. It\u2019s always earthquake season there. You can\u2019t plan a trip around one,\u201d she said, setting her bottle of water in the cup holder. \u201cDid I mention I\u2019m seriously scared of earthquakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last one you were in was years ago and it barely registered much less made the evening news,\u201d Melanie said, hitting play on the radio. The perky vocals of a unicorn singing about rainbows and magical carpet rides filled the minivan.</p><p>\u201cYay,\u201d SmithAnn shouted from her car seat in the back.</p><p>Zoe turned and smiled at her niece. She grabbed a shoeless foot and tickled the bottom. The little girl was the spitting image of her mother, with curly blond hair and warm brown eyes. A sprinkle of freckles danced across her nose as she wrinkled it and squealed with glee.</p><p>The usual longing for a family like her sister-in-law\u2019s hit Zoe hard and fast. She nibbled her bottom lip and bit back a sigh.</p><p>Slowly, Zoe turned around, adjusting the sunglasses perched on her nose. Miles and miles of cloudless, eastern North Carolina skies filled her vision as she looked out of the passenger side window. So blue, so much like\u2014no she wouldn\u2019t think of that right now. Or at all.</p> <p>She shifted her attention to the road and frowned. The Johnsons\u2019 florescent green mailbox seemed a lot closer to the road than it usually was. Her eyes rounded. It wasn\u2019t closer; the minivan was practically off the curb.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap,\u201d Zoe shouted, her hands braced against the dash. \u201cMailbox.\u201d</p><p>Melanie jerked the minivan to the left, narrowly missing the opportunity to scrape a racing stripe down the side of her vehicle. SmithAnn let out a high pitched shriek of laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, what do you think of my suggestion?\u201d Melanie asked, her voice calm despite their near crash.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re the woman my mother warned my brothers about,\u201d Zoe muttered, mentally peeling herself off of the ceiling. She adjusted her seatbelt, pulling it tighter.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I am the woman your mother constantly warned your brother about. Proud of it, too.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s why Zoe loved her sister-in-law. Melanie was daring, bold and didn\u2019t care what other people thought of her. While Zoe tried very hard to be good, to be responsible. To be perfectly boring while writing novels that, according to her mother, were \u201cscandalous\u201d because they contained s-e-x scenes. Why her mother spelled the word instead of saying it made no sense to Zoe.</p><p>God only knew what her mother would say (or spell) if Zoe revealed that the villain of her series was her favorite character to write, and that the heroine was secretly in love with the deliciously evil Dimitri while settling for the straight-laced Joshua.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Melanie announced, parking the minivan by the curb.</p><p>Zoe kissed her niece good-bye, exited the passenger side, then headed to the back of the minivan to get her luggage. Melanie ambushed her, grabbing Zoe\u2019s shoulders and looking her right in the eye.</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll let loose and have fun. Do the whole book signing and boring meetings while being respectable Zoe. Then go lock her in a closet and be a newly single woman with a rockin\u2019 body who\u2019s looking for a man. Or five.\u201d</p><p>Zoe kept her mouth closed as Melanie continued talking. The quicker Melanie got her speech out of her system, the quicker Zoe could get to her gate.</p><p>\u201cPromise me.\u201d Melanie gave her a little shake.</p><p>She let out a heavy sigh. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAggravating sister-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp-tight best friend.\u201d Melanie hugged her, then sent her off with a smile. \u201cRemember, do talk to strangers. Especially if they\u2019re hot and male. If your normal response would be to say nothing, then do it anyway. Oh, I slipped a bikini in your carry-on.\u201d</p><p>Zoe lifted her hand in the air, giving Melanie a backwards wave. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ignore me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>The automatic door closed in behind her, or at least tried to. She glanced over her shoulder, watching as the metal and glass smacked her luggage again and again. Holland Springs\u2019 tiny airport could really use some updating.</p><p>So could she.</p><p>Usually she was the luggage, letting life happen to her. At the next opportunity, she pulled her luggage free, straightened her shoulders and marched to security. It was time have a firm grip on her life, where she was going and what she\u2019d do next.</p><p>Then she turned around. Flight check-in was to the right of her, not the left.</p><p>Christian Romanov sat in the music room of his father\u2019s mansion, staring at the massive antique chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Sunlight filtered through the hand-cut crystal pendants, casting rainbows along the walls and hardwood floor. It had been his mother\u2019s favorite. His father considered it an eyesore but there had been a story attached to it. One that involved Very Important People. Therefore the chandelier remained.</p><p>Unlike his mother. Or Christian for that matter.</p><p>Closing his eyes, he spread his fingers and slid them along the black and white keys of the Borgato, coaxing a soft tune as his agent, Martha Alfred, hit her stride, shouting at him over the phone.</p><p>\u201cYour career is about to go the way of the Dodo once the press learns about this expensive, not to mention illegal, little habit. There are pictures in my inbox. Do you realize that if these are leaked, or discovered by anyone who isn\u2019t me, you will become uninsurable? No financier will touch any film you\u2019re associated with and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve told you before, it was years ago,\u201d Christian said. Besides, he was wealthy enough to finance his own damn movies. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been very honest about my past with the press and you.\u201d For the most part anyway.</p><p>Martha harrumphed. \u201cThe date stamp on all seven read January of this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep insisting, but these look legitimate.\u201d</p><p>Nearly a year had passed since he\u2019d last touched any illegal substance. It hadn\u2019t been one incident that led to him go cold turkey, but rather a string of waking up without a clue as to where he was and what or who\u2019d he done the night before.</p><p>Simply put, he\u2019d had enough.</p><p>He stopped playing and opened his eyes. Unfortunately, that wouldn\u2019t be enough to convince anyone that the pictures really were half a decade old. He would look like the biggest hypocritical ass, not to mention liar, to ever walk the planet if they went viral, since he was slated to be the newest spokesman for Back To School.</p><p>The organization was endorsed by M.A.D.D. and D.A.R.E. In addition to those heavy hitters, an anonymous donor financially supported the effort B.T.S. made to get teens off the streets, off of drugs and/or gangs, and firmly on the path that led to a brighter future. Since his involvement had been made public, the paparazzi had done their level best to find out the identity of the donor, without success.</p><p>Christian knew exactly who the donor was and he wasn\u2019t telling. The designation of anonymous meant just that\u2014anonymous.</p><p>Besides, this was something he\u2019d done without agents, managers or public relations assistants. It was all his idea, his way of making amends for all the ways he\u2019d screwed up over the years. The next round of public service announcements, featuring him, would start this fall. He had all but signed away his first born to get them to take a chance on him. To get them to look past his party reputation, the drunken clips on TMZ and the People Magazine documented failed relationships.</p><p>The very real possibility that it all could be shot to hell in a matter of minutes left him cold inside.</p><p>\u201cThe photos have been manipulated.\u201d There were only a handful of people that were privy to his finances and personal activities. The majority of them were bound by ironclad confidentiality agreements. As for the others...</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t you at a party, snorting coke off of a table, the bar and on three different strippers\u2019 stomachs?\u201d</p><p>Frustration kicked him in the gut. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. Bad press doesn\u2019t equal movie roles anymore. The economy won\u2019t allow it. I won\u2019t allow it. Are we clear, Mr. Romanov?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the retort that sprang to mind. It would do no good to argue with the tenacious woman. Or tell her that his career was second to his reputation with B.T.S. \u201cCrystal, Ms. Alfred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind a non-Hollywood type of woman to be seen with once you get back to the States. This is not a suggestion. You will revamp your image. You will start taking leads in chick-flicks, and become all minivan-family-friendly. Why don\u2019t we start with something simple, like having the press call you Christian Romanov instead of your stage name Ian Romanov?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Bryson I\u2019m dying to audition for the male lead in The Heart Says Yes.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep the sarcasm out of his voice, but knew Martha didn\u2019t care as long as she got her way. \u201cBut my name remains as is. It\u2019s how I keep things separated.\u201d No matter how inconsequential it seemed. There were very few people that called him Christian. Martha, despite their years of working together, wasn\u2019t one of them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your career on the line, not mine.\u201d She ended their call.</p><p>A butler entered the room and gave him a small nod.</p><p>Christian shrugged into a cashmere overcoat and slid on leather gloves. He walked out of the townhome, then jogged down the front steps. A silver Mercedes with darkly tinted windows idled in the circular drive. Boris, the Romanov\u2019s head of security, waited by the back passenger side door and opened it for Christian.</p><p>He slid in and found Sebastian staring at him, blue eyes as cold and icy as Lake Baikal in April. Christian met the unflinching gaze with one of his own and smirked, running his hands through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s like looking in a mirror. Makes a brother all reminiscent about our childhood.\u201d Before they became more like enemies than brothers. Before nothing was expected of Christian and everything was expected of Sebastian.</p><p>\u201cYou are becoming more American by the year. At least you remember the correct form of dress.\u201d Sebastian picked up the iPad on the seat beside him. \u201cTwo more years, then your permanent return is expected and Ian, the Hollywood Actor, is no more. Which would help your legend live in memoriam best: plane crash, car explosion, or overdose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust listening to you would make any man die of boredom. Contact your secretary for an appointment, shall I?\u201d Christian would retire from acting when he damned well pleased, not because he was needed in the family business.</p><p>\u201cAlways the comedian.\u201d Sebastian glanced at the window, then back at him. \u201cReady for the soiree this evening?\u201d</p><p>An evening of forced conversations and associations? Christian fought the grimace threatening to pull down the corners of his mouth. \u201cWild horses couldn\u2019t keep me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Christian. Is there any way you could ever be discreet?\u201d Sebastian asked, all attention on the iPad in his lap.</p><p>\u201cThe press won\u2019t let me.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Vivian Cross is lonely in London. She\u2019s pining away for former flame, Ian Romanov\u2019,\u201d Sebastian read from the screen, then stabbed at it with his finger. \u201cWhy does anyone read this drivel?\u201d</p><p>Because people craved it, whether the gossip was true or not. Hell, if he so much as sneezed in the general direction of any woman, he was suddenly canoodling with her.</p><p>God, he hated that word.</p><p>\u201cIf I told you, it would only confirm every bloody opinion you\u2019ve had about American culture,\u201d Christian said with a small rise of his brows. \u201cAs for Vivian, it\u2019s not true. We were never together. She\u2019s married. Happily, I might add, but even if she weren\u2019t, I stay away from married women.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian barked out a laugh. \u201cThe fabrications of your life are so entertaining. How unfortunate you leave in two days.\u201d</p><p>In two days he would have to find a woman, with whom he\u2019d be expected to fabricate an entire relationship. Damn his brother and damn his agent. \u201cMy entire career, not to mention a very worthwhile organization\u2019s reputation is at stake, thanks to you sending those pictures to Martha,\u201d Christian growled, hands fisting.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I was the one to send them to her?\u201d</p><p>Was Sebastian serious? Christian\u2019s knuckles cracked. \u201cYou sent them the first time. Luckily, the person who received them is a friend and wouldn\u2019t take your money. Afterwards, I had the IP address traced.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, Sebastian\u2019s cold eyes bore into his. \u201cWhat a resourceful bloke you\u2019ve become, but I had nothing to do with this set.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Christian said flatly.</p><p>\u201cLike that matters. I\u2019ve greater things to worry about than your opinion of me.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Christian did believe, but he refused to let it bother him, because why should things ever be any different between them?</p><p>Vladimir Romanov took one look at his youngest son, pressed his lips in a thin line, then escorted him to the Von Lichtensteins. Their daughter, a popular socialite who moved in American and European circles, was shoved in Christian\u2019s face. His father\u2019s idea of the perfect spouse. But of course, spouse meant business transaction.</p><p>Christian winked and flashed his teeth at the dark haired woman. She hid behind her hand and let out intermittent high-pitched giggles while their respective fathers launched into a diatribe about the Euro\u2019s competition with the Dollar.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think of the big award show you went to this year?\u201d she asked, her voice breathless. Her gaze slid over to their parents, then back to him.</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cWhich one?\u201d</p> <p>She widened her eyes and placed a manicured hand over her chest. \u201cOh, any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food was bad, the company worse and the length atrocious. Other than that it was absolutely stupendous,\u201d he said. Actually, he rather enjoyed attending them and meeting his fans. They would line up days ahead of time to show their support. For them he\u2019d always show up, always take a picture and sign an autograph. Only he couldn\u2019t let his father know it.</p><p>Christian took great pleasure in letting Vladimir think that he only pursued acting to irritate him. Most likely, his father wouldn\u2019t think of keeping the people that paid good money to watch him on screen happy or that Christian would ever be grateful for their support.</p><p>The Baron and Christian\u2019s father looked at him with expectation written on their faces.</p><p>Play the part, Christian. He inclined his head, murmuring, \u201cOf course, it would have been all the more bearable had you been my date. In fact I\u2019d be honored if you\u2019d accompany me to my next awards show.\u201d He glanced at his father, whose mouth wasn\u2019t pinched or frowning. It was the closest Christian would ever get to a job well done from Vladimir.</p><p>Their parents walked away.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a good one,\u201d Kate said, smiling at the cameras aimed in their direction.</p><p>Rocking back on his heels, Christian sucked in air through his teeth and gave a light shrug. \u201cNot my best performance, but you were entirely convincing, dear Kate. My ears bleeding copious amounts of blood can attest to it.\u201d</p><p>Kate Von Lichtenstein, dubbed by the British tabloids as Peaches due to a very unfortunate sixteenth birthday party incident, playfully swatted him on the arm. Her smile widened, dimples playing hide-and-seek in her cheeks. She hated their fathers\u2019 machinations as much as he did, but they played their parts well. Simpering socialite and playboy actor. Okay, so maybe he wasn\u2019t exactly playing at a part.</p><p>She linked her arm with his, pressing closer in the imitation of flirting. \u201cHow long are you staying tonight?\u201d</p><p>He covered her hand with his, conscious of the very best angle that would serve to make their parents happy. \u201cJust until the cavalry arrives. Then it\u2019s off to Las Vegas to find a woman.\u201d</p><p>Dark brows lifted and she tsked. \u201cIan Romanov having to find a woman\u2014the zombie apocalypse must be at hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean Chemsky won\u2019t budge on FRC?\u201d Vladimir asked, capturing Christian\u2019s attention.</p><p>As if on cue, his brother joined in on the conversation. \u201cI have a meeting scheduled with Ivan on Monday. Rest assured he\u2019ll see things our way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent news, Sebastian. Trust you to have everything in hand.\u201d</p><p>Christian inwardly flinched as Vladimir gave Sebastian a hearty pat on the back and a look of respect. One that he would never bestow upon Christian. One that Christian thought he no longer cared about. But tonight, for some reason it twisted; it clawed and burned his insides.</p><p>\u201cCome with me if you don\u2019t want to die of boredom.\u201d His cousin, Sasha, clapped him on the back. \u201cOr from the lobster rolls. Paula Dean, that goddess of butter, would gasp in horror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve often wondered if your obsession with that woman had come to an end.\u201d Christian let go of Kate and turned to face him.</p><p>Sasha canted his head. \u201cYou say obsession; I say worship.\u201d</p><p>Christian grunted, then shot an apologetic glance at Kate whose attention was clearly elsewhere. From across the room, his brother\u2019s eyes connected with hers for the briefest of moments before Sebastian looked away. Kate seemed to deflate.</p><p>What a bloody idiot. Christian gently patted her shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to make a run for it.\u201d</p><p>Bright spots of pink colored her cheeks, before she flashed a brilliant smile. \u201cI\u2019d love to come with you.\u201d</p><p>Christian lifted her hand to his lips.\u201cWe both know I\u2019m not what you want.\u201d</p><p>A wistful expression covered her face. \u201cI\u2019m not what he wants either.\u201d She turned, walking away with her head held high as she melted into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cYour brother\u2019s a prat.\u201d There was no love lost between Sasha and Sebastian. Rather strange if anyone asked Christian, given the way the three were inseparable growing up. Then again, Sasha had cast his lot with him instead of Sebastian.</p><p>\u201cNo argument from me there,\u201d Christian replied. Kate would survive. Just as she always had. He pulled out his phone and texted his pilot. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve done my duty and now it\u2019s off to Vegas to find a woman.\u201d</p><p>Sasha scrunched up his nose on one side. \u201cYou do know women are here.\u201d He gestured at the crowd of people. \u201cIn this room. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Christian shrugged. \u201cNot what Martha has in mind. I have to find a small town girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Las Vegas?\u201d Sasha asked, his voice incredulous.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll roll the dice and see what happens.\u201d Christian grinned and slid his phone into his pocket.</p><p>Sasha raised his brows. \u201cYou are extraordinarily horrible at gambling. I\u2019ve never seen a man more unlucky than you at cards. \u201d</p><p>Christian knew it was true, but he wasn\u2019t about to agree. \u201cWell, you know what they say: unlucky at cards, lucky in love. And I plan to get very, very lucky in Vegas.\u201d Or at least appear to.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Zoe was not having the greatest day ever. In fact she was having the longest day ever.</p><p>First, a demon-possessed water fountain had sprayed all over her cardigan right before she was supposed to board her final connecting flight to Las Vegas. With no time to dry the material under a hand dryer in the bathroom, she had stuffed it in a separate pocket inside her carry-on.</p><p>Then her plane had landed at McCarran Airport five hours late due to engine problems. She was thankful someone had found the problem and had been attempting to fix it. But being trapped on the tarmac for two hours before they had to switch planes had frazzled her nerves.</p><p>However, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance came after waiting another forty-five minutes when she was informed that all of her luggage had been lost. They were doing their very best to locate her bags, but it could take up to two weeks.</p><p>She filled out the necessary forms to send the luggage back home instead of having it arrive in Vegas long after her trip was over. Now all she needed was an earthquake and her predictions of things to come could make her the next Nostradamus.</p><p>\u201cThank God for VISA.\u201d She headed toward the exit, shoving her sunglasses back on her nose.</p><p>A hard body rammed into her. Hands grabbed her arms, preventing her from falling but her purse went flying, sending the contents sliding across the floor as her carry-on slipped from her grasp.</p><p>A man wearing a dark suit and even darker glasses grimaced. \u201cSorry, ma\u2019am. Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d She pushed her sunglasses to the top of her head and dropped to her knees to collect her things.</p><p>\u201cActually, it was entirely my fault. Let me help you,\u201d another male voice said, the clipped British tones doing things to her body that should\u2019ve been banned in customs. \u201cGive the lady some room, Nathan. I plowed into her.\u201d</p><p>The fine hair on the back of her neck stood. She knew that voice. It had whispered to her in her dreams and while she wrote. Her muse. Her biggest mistake. \u201cIt\u2019s fine...really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist; it\u2019s the least I can do for running into you.\u201d He knelt beside her and grabbed her book from the tiled floor.</p><p>\u201cWhile I insist you don\u2019t,\u201d she said, moving quickly to scoop up the remaining items. His loafers hit her line of vision and she stood slowly as possible to find the face of People Magazine\u2019s Sexiest Bachelor for two years running.</p><p>Wheat blond hair fell in a purposefully disarrayed fashion, a sexy topper to his fallen angel face, but it was his eyes that captured and held her attention first. Blue eyes so pure in color that they looked like aquamarine gemstones. While most people dressed down for flights, opting for comfort over style, he looked like a men\u2019s magazine cover model, wearing an open-at-the- throat classic button down and khaki trousers that made the most of his long, lean frame.</p><p>God, she wished she had a slushy handy right about now. He wouldn\u2019t look so good wearing neon blue all over his face.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He gave her a crooked smile, flashing perfect white teeth though a pair of sensuous lips.</p><p>For a moment his smile completely disarmed her and she blurted out the first thing that came to mind. \u201cGood grief, you\u2019ve gotten tall. What I mean is you look taller in person than you do in your movies, but isn\u2019t that true about most actors? Oh, wait, no, they\u2019re usually shorter in person and not as good looking. Hmm...um. Well, at least you look better in person and um...\u201d Zoe faltered mid-sentence, face heating. This was not how she pictured their next meeting. Instead of a bumbling, blushing fool, she was cool and precise. Maybe even a little skewering with very carefully chosen words. Too late now. \u201cAnyway, the last time I saw you, you were a little shorter, but only by a couple of inches and now you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>Golden brows drew together slightly before he settled back into his famous smile. The same one he seemed to have in every picture taken of him. The one that set women\u2019s hearts and other places all aquiver. Unfortunately, it included hers as well.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat party was that by the way? I can\u2019t imagine I didn\u2019t take the time to talk to someone so pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re unforgettable, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just said you don\u2019t remember me.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his wide shoulders. \u201cSorry, I meet a lot of women.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a hint of smugness in his voice, more like a universal truth about his life.</p><p>And the truth hurt. A lot. She wanted to scream at the familiar pain that stabbed at her heart, at him for being the biggest asshole on the planet. Even if she was being unfair. It really wasn\u2019t his fault he didn\u2019t remember meeting her\u2014at least not the second time.</p><p>\u201cGive me back my book.\u201d She tried grabbing it again, but he held it above her head like he wanted to play keep-away.</p><p>He turned it over and scanned the back, then glanced up at her. \u201cYou read this crap?\u201d</p><p>Crap? \u201cIt\u2019s literature and you\u2019re one to talk. Especially with the last movie you did. It was horrendous and full of plot holes. I couldn\u2019t determine what the goal, motivation or conflict was supposed to be. Well, not beyond blow them up, save the world and get the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you watched it anyway,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>She made a face. \u201cDidn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d she muttered. Actually, she\u2019d watched it twice and bought the DVD when it came out.</p><p>As if he were reading her mind, he bent his head down and peered at her through sinfully long lashes. \u201cAnd you loved it.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips and shook her head. \u201cNope. Lack of G.M.C.\u201d</p><p>He scrunched up one side of his face in confusion, and she mouthed the words goal, motivation and conflict at him. When he didn\u2019t respond she flicked her hands in the air. He was hopeless.</p><p>Glints of humor flashed in his blue eyes.</p><p>And purposefully obtuse.</p><p>\u201cAt least I got paid twenty million for it. You don\u2019t get paid to read this smut, do you?\u201d Christian waved the book in her face, her green eyes almost crossing as it passed by her nose. \u201cOh, sorry, this classic piece of literature that Shakespeare would\u2019ve given his left nut to read.\u201d He had no idea why he wanted to tease her. Why he wanted to see what she would do or say next. Only that he wanted her to keep talking in that soft southern drawl of hers.</p><p>\u201cDo you get you\u2019re a butthead a lot, too?\u201d</p><p>What the hell was she referring to? Oh, right the taller in person remark. \u201cNot since what you Americans call middle school or whatever it is in this country that masquerades as public education.\u201d</p><p>She tapped her foot repeatedly, sending his eyes down to her shoes. He swallowed at the sight of ribbons caressing her shapely legs as they disappeared under her dress.</p><p>\u201cPrepare yourself, because there's more where that came from, you snobby anglophile,\" she said, tossing her ponytail to one side.</p><p>Christian bit the inside of his cheek, trying to contain his laughter. She didn't seem to give a damn who he was. Actually, she looked and sounded quite put-off by him. Her eyes darted around, as if looking for an exit. An unusual experience in his life. One that he found he liked.</p><p>The subtle scent of honeysuckle drifted toward him and for a moment she reminded him of the woman who haunted his dreams. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHoneysuckle?\u201d At her nod, he lifted a bright red curl and brought it to his nose for a moment before letting it slip through his fingers, immediately jealous of the strand as it caressed a bare shoulder. \u201cDo you taste as sweet as you smell?\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest, scowling. \u201cStop doing that, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop doing what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStaring at me.\u201d She glanced around, then back at him. \u201cIt\u2019s making everyone else stare, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to look at you?\u201d he snapped, chagrinned at the memories she provoked.</p><p>Glossy lips pressed together. \u201cDo you need a how-to-stop-being-a-jerk manual? I\u2019ve got a copy in my purse, and it\u2019s the one for dummies.\u201d</p><p>He scraped a hand through his hair, willing away his misdirected anger. She couldn\u2019t help what scent she wore. \u201cBy chance, do you have a manual on how to apologize appropriately to a woman while still holding on to your man cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid someone will tear them up?\u201d Her brows quirked.</p> <p>\u201cJust a little.\u201d He grinned.\u201cWhere are you staying? I\u2019d like to take you out. Actually, I\u2019d love to make you breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed a charming shade of pink. \u201cAt The Oasis, but I\u2019ll be busy with meetings and a book signing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he asked and for a moment her eyes flashed at him, but then her rosy lips curved into a smile that sucked away his breath.</p><p>\u201cZoe Ambrose.\u201d She pulled her phone out of her purse.</p><p>\u201cIan Romanov.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, but he wasn\u2019t sure if it was at him or the message on her phone.\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCall me Christian.\u201d It slipped out before he could stop himself.</p><p>Her lashes flicked up, giving him a glimpse of forest colored eyes. \u201cI\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>The relief that should have accompanied her answer never hit him. Instead her answer annoyed the hell out of him. Now he needed her to call him Christian. He also needed his head checked for caring about anyone\u2019s opinion of him, while standing in the middle of an airport, with his bodyguards on one side and random people on the other, taking pictures and uploading videos to You Tube.</p><p>However, it didn\u2019t stop him from asking, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNorth Carolina.\u201d Small white teeth worried her bottom lip as she typed.</p><p>\u201cSmall town?\u201d How serendipitous would it be to land at McCarran and find his small town image remake at the airport? It also didn\u2019t hurt that she looked...normal. She was exactly what the girl-next-door should look like. Pleasing to the eye, but not the kind of face and body to drive a man insane with lust.</p><p>He let his gaze travel over her. On second thought, the curves highlighted by her dress were something that needed to be studied. In his bed.</p><p>Her fingers paused and her brows drew together. \u201cNo, it\u2019s a state.\u201d</p> <p>A what? Oh, good God, she thought he didn\u2019t know...He bit back another grin. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve worked at the studios in Wilmington before. Is the town you\u2019re from small or large?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...oh,\u201d she said, her cheeks turning pink again. She glanced down, her thumbs nimble over her keypad. \u201cIt\u2019s small.\u201d</p><p>Fantastic. He stepped closer to her, his body humming in anticipation. \u201cI\u2019d love to get together while you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but I\u2019ll be too busy to socialize.\u201d Tucking her phone back into her purse, she smiled. \u201cWell, have a nice day.\u201d She turned, grabbed her carry-on and walked away.</p><p>From him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t form a proper reply. He was too damn stunned at being so easily dismissed.</p><p>She tripped over the smooth floor, stumbling into a guy wearing a Brooks Brothers\u2019 suit and making him drop his luggage to catch her. Envy stabbed at Christian\u2019s gut when the man wrapped his arms around her and she laughed up at him.</p><p>Christian frowned and crossed his arms over his chest. He widened his stance, ignoring everyone but Zoe as he eavesdropped on their conversation.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my card. Maybe we can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, I already have a lawyer. Do you know where the drivers wait?\u201d She handed the business card back.</p><p>The dark-haired lawyer pointed to the left, his shoulders slumping when she told him to have a good day. Then they both got to watch her cute little bum as she marched off.</p><p>A strange feeling passed over Christian. It was almost as if he recognized that walk. Then again, she had said they\u2019d met before. Perhaps that\u2019s why she was so irritated with him. But honestly, he couldn\u2019t remember meeting someone who looked or sounded like her.</p><p>Zoe turned right and disappeared, then reappeared a few seconds later heading in the opposite direction.</p><p>Oh, she was extremely adorable. And, he noticed as she glanced back in his direction, extremely unnerved by him. What had he done to her? Or rather with her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. He wanted her for his image remake. Whatever he had to do to get back on her good side, he\u2019d consider it his absolute pleasure.</p><p>Gripping her book in his hand, he smiled victoriously. Every woman he knew liked to read by the pool or in the bath. It was up to him to return it to her like any other Good Samaritan. He grabbed his duffle bag from the floor and slid the book in a side pocket. \u201cNow who\u2019s lucky?\u201d</p><p>With his bodyguards flanking him, he followed the woman who was doing her best to escape him. Suddenly, she ducked around a corner. There was no way he was going to let her get away. She was the answer to his prayers.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>She had gotten away.</p><p>Christian took a shot of vodka from one of the glasses set on the table beside him. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how a man looked at things), this was only shot number one. No matter how irritated he was, he wouldn\u2019t ruin his chance with B.T.S on his end.</p><p>The three women in his penthouse chatted with each other as they texted and searched for just the right channel on the flat screen. Twins plus one had seemed like a great idea. Actually, the text he\u2019d received from Vanessa Carlton during his layover in New York had seemed like an erotically brilliant idea. But that had been before he met Zoe.</p><p>Now here he was, an hour later, and not remotely interested in doing anything beyond pouring drinks and flirt. Poorly.</p><p>Not his usual MO. And he was a healthy, red-blooded bloke.</p><p>Letting out a harsh breath, he pushed at a couple of glasses. They smacked into each other with dull thuds. He had to find her. It wasn\u2019t just because she turned him down. She was perfect for what he needed: small town girl, unimpressed with who he was and had a wicked wit.</p><p>He\u2019d had fun verbally sparring with her. He\u2019d had fun teasing her, and reading (very clearly) the expressions on her face. She also had a very lovely smile when she wasn\u2019t scowling at him.</p><p>Zoe. Closing his eyes, he leaned his head against the back of the chair.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Vanessa not Zoe.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s eyes popped open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Vanessa\u2019s narrowed as she walked over to stand in front of him. \u201cYou called me Zoe when I asked if you wanted to go out with us later.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. He examined the shot glass in his hand, trying without success to think of something to say.</p><p>The twins joined in, planting fists on their hips. \u201cHer name is Vanessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very lovely name.\u201d He stood and strode to the bathroom. \u201cThis has been most...diverting, but I\u2019ve need of a shower.\u201d Imitating how Sebastian talked should send them scrambling for the elevator.</p><p>\u201cBut we haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Vanessa said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s going to divert us in the shower,\u201d said one of the twins.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll be diverting by myself,\u201d he said, flashing an apologetic grin.</p><p>Spiked heels clicking on the tiled floor followed him in, but he ignored it. He braced his palms on the vanity top and looked into the mirror only to find them staring expectantly at him.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Zoe?\u201d Vanessa pressed.</p><p>\u201cDo any of you speak French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d they answered in unison.</p><p>\u201cZoe means awesome in French,\u201d he improvised.</p><p>\u201cWe speak American,\u201d Vanessa said with a disgusted look on her face. The twins nodded in agreement.</p><p>He rubbed a hand over his face. \u201cIf you ladies will excuse me...\u201d</p><p>Of course, they stayed rooted in place.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he be an asshole and make them leave? Because he wasn\u2019t a completely heartless bastard or a hypocrite, that\u2019s why, and he\u2019d been intent on having all sorts of fun with them, before he\u2019d met a prickly brunette with lovely eyes and a thick-as-honey accent.</p><p>Sighing, he strode to the toilet and shut the door behind him. He closed the lid and sat on top of it. Maybe if he stayed in here for a while, they\u2019d get the hint.</p><p>A knock sounded on the door. Guess not. \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>One of the women knocked again. Exhaling, he stood and opened the door. The trio stood in his way, blocking his exit. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d one of the twins asked.</p><p>\u201cJet lag,\u201d he lied. \u201cI think a shower will help.\u201d</p><p>They moved as a group out of his way, whispering as he snagged a towel. He walked to the shower, turning on the multiple heads before shedding his clothes.</p><p>As they continued to stare, he had an urge to cover himself. \u201cPlease don\u2019t wait around for me. Go try your luck at the slots,\u201d he suggested, stepping into the hot blasts of water.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Kylie.\u201d Vanessa shoved her forward.</p><p>\u201cWe, like, think that you should, like, introduce us to your friends, Wade and Brennen McGowan. You did say they would be here tomorrow, right?\u201d Kylie asked. \u201cVanessa said there would be some producers here, too.\u201d</p><p>Christian grabbed a bar of soap, scrubbing at his skin to wash away the guilt that covered him. Kylie and her sister shouldn\u2019t be here. They should at college parties, not trying to live the Hollywood hype. Vanessa, however, knew exactly what she was doing. As a B-list actress with A-list goals, she\u2019d been playing the be-seen-with-a-celebrity game for years now. It was a game that every actor, male or female, had to play at first.</p><p>He slathered shaving gel on his face. \u201cYes to all of the above. Brennen and Wade would love it if the three of you joined us tomorrow tonight.\u201d Well, Brennen would. Wade, however, would probably grunt and cross his arms.</p><p>They clapped and squealed like little girls, almost making him nick his chin as he shaved. \u201cAll of you are over twenty-one, aren\u2019t you?\u201d That\u2019s all he needed to place the final nail in the coffin: pictures of him doing coke and under-aged girls in his hotel room. Fantastic.</p><p>All three nodded their heads and he relaxed. Again Kylie answered, \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re, like, twenty-three and stuff. Don\u2019t worry it\u2019s all street legal with us.\u201d</p><p>He quirked a brow, his reflection mimicking the movement in the fog resistant mirror hanging on the tiled wall. \u201cStreet legal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, like, the game about cars and stuff. We can\u2019t, like, get arrested for partying here \u2018cause we\u2019re legal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat certainly clears things up.\u201d He finished shaving, then leaned against the tiled wall and welcomed the hot water beating down on his body. His head ached and he felt closer to eighty than twenty-six.</p><p>The trio sighed, startling him. He smacked his head against the wall, his eyes watering in pain. \u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d He blinked a couple of times and rubbed his forehead with the heel of his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, were we supposed to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going to watch him diverting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ex-boyfriend liked to record me when I\u2019m diverting.\u201d</p><p>Christian wanted to bang his head against the tiles, on purpose this time. Instead, he breathed deeply and gave his signature smile. He got out of the shower, turning off the spigots and wrapping an extra large black towel around his waist. \u201cBe at Shift around eleven tomorrow night. All of you will be on my guest list.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to appease even Vanessa. They gathered their things and headed to the elevator.</p><p>\u201cThis is so zoe, Ian Romanov,\u201d Kylie squealed as the elevator doors shut.</p><p>He groaned, rubbing his hand over his face. Stupid, stupid, massively stupid. Zoe was French for awesome? Christ.</p><p>Looking around the room, he zeroed in on the book sitting on a table by the elevator doors. He ambled over and picked it up, rubbing his thumb along the outline of the author\u2019s name and paused.</p><p>Was that a Z?</p><p>He rubbed it again and frowned. Tilting it toward the lamp, he nearly dropped the book when the name caught the light. He barked out a laugh and walked back to his bedroom, tossing it on the dresser. Zoe Ambrose was the author. No damn wonder he\u2019d pissed her off.</p><p>Grabbing his phone, he texted Wade, then sank down into the mattress. A yawn cracked open his jaw.</p><p>Tomorrow. He would find her tomorrow and apologize.</p><p>Christian forged a wet path with his tongue down to her breasts, sucking on each nipple in turn as he plunged inside of her. God, it felt so good to be in her, to be gripped so tightly that he couldn\u2019t see straight.</p><p>She writhed beneath him, her lush curves an erotic contrast to his. Delicate hands ran up and down his back as he pleasured her. She slipped them beneath the waistband of his trousers to cup his ass, her nails digging in and making him growl.</p><p>He bit the side of her neck and then laved at the spot. She trembled against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to come,\u201d her words were a breathless rush.</p><p>Gazing at her, satisfaction filled him when he found the mask she usually wore replaced by the face of Zoe Ambrose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He bolted straight up in bed, his body covered in sweat and aching for relief. Cursing, he flopped back down. There was no way he\u2019d be able to sleep. Gripping his cock, he stroked it, bringing back his dream. He focused on her face, her eyes and lips. The way she smelled as he pressed his nose against her neck. She moaned his name and he came, endlessly.</p><p>After cleaning himself up, he fell back to sleep. In what seemed like seconds later, a shrill ringtone had him blindly smacking around for his phone. He found it under the pillow beside him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d his agent shouted.</p> <p>He winced. \u201cI\u2019m in Vegas at The Oasis in my room and alone in bed, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you \u2018honey\u2019 me. I haven\u2019t heard from you since yesterday,\u201d she said, her voice a bit softer. \u201cWhere are you headed tonight?\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his eyes, he tried to get the fog to clear his mind. Was it already morning? \u201cShift with Wade and Brennen.\u201d First, however, he would find Zoe.</p><p>\u201cChange of plans. You\u2019re going to RARE for dinner with some suits from Peak Pictures and my favorite romance author.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been over this a dozen times: I don\u2019t want to meet with some dried up old biddy who writes for younger dried up biddies in training,\u201d he grumbled.</p> <p>\u201cI read those books, Ian. So watch your mouth,\u201d Martha warned. What a surprise. Next, he'd find out that she liked to make money and yell over the phone at him. \u201cThe author is one of my clients, you know, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I know that? Is it in the fine print of my contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? Be at the damn restaurant at 8:30 pm and look sharp. No red eyes or glassy stares. Understand, Romanov?\u201d Her voice cracked like a whip as she continued, \u201cDon\u2019t. Be. Late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo red eyes, no glassy stares and don\u2019t be late,\u201d he repeated. Martha would make his life more of a living hell if he didn\u2019t show up. And those pictures lurked in her inbox, ready at a double-click\u2019s notice to be spread to all major news outlets and gossip columnists.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing. The author, old biddy that she is, expressed a preference for you to play the villain, after viewing the readings. Seemed she thought something of your work. Chloe informed her of the dinner yesterday, although Zoe declined.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be that simple. He couldn\u2019t be that lucky. \u201cZoe Ambrose?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Did you finally read one of the books I sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He glanced over at the floor to ceiling windows. They were covered with a heavy fabric that blocked the morning sun, in order to provide the best sleep experience possible. However, The Oasis hadn\u2019t counted on Martha Alfred\u2019s phone calls.</p><p>\u201cWhy she chose you over Wade, who has read her books, clearly boggles the mind.\u201d</p><p>Looked like he had some reading to do. \u201cClearly.\u201d Pressing the remote beside the bed, the heavy drapes parted. \u201cI happened to have run into Ms. Ambrose at the airport yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Martha continued as if she hadn\u2019t heard him and said, \u201cOnly in public. Where people can see you and take pictures. No backroom shenanigans.\u201d</p><p>Backroom shenanigans? He blinked. \u201cWhat kind of man do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want me to answer that, do you?\u201d Martha asked.</p><p>\u201cHas that ever stopped you before?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think she would be wonderful for your image.\u201d</p><p>If it had been anyone other than Zoe, he would have argued with Martha. He would have reminded her of their conversation that had taken places only two days ago. That he was to choose the woman to help him. \u201cYour command is ever my wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me your theatrics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, your highness. Whatever you say, your highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod above give me strength.\u201d Christian thought he heard a smile in her voice before she launched into another lecture. \u201cOne more thing.\u201d Just how many one more things did the woman have? He popped his neck on each side. \u201cDon\u2019t scare her to death with your scandalous behavior while you\u2019re showing her around Vegas,\u201d Martha said before hanging up.</p><p>Christian smiled at his reflection in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d Lady Luck was with him in Vegas.</p><p>Zoe rolled over in bed and stretched, feeling refreshed from a good night\u2019s sleep and an afternoon nap. She had checked into a well-appointed suite at The Oasis, her view of the strip framed by thick drapes.</p><p>It looked like a sinner\u2019s playground, beckoning for visitors to come. To lose themselves in the nightlife. \u201cOoh, that was a good one.\u201d She reached for a small notebook and pen, scribbling her thought into it so she wouldn\u2019t forget it later.</p><p>Her cell rang and she struggled to answer it, falling off the bed in the process as she hit one of the buttons.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap! Hello? Hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to yell,\u201d Martha Alfred gently chastised.</p><p>Zoe blew hair out of her eyes as she righted herself. \u201cSorry, I dropped my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling more yourself today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Oh, remember how I told you that the airline lost my luggage before I went shopping? After the managers of the boutiques told me that they would deliver my stuff to The Oasis, I got someone else\u2019s clothes, but at least I took my most important bag with me. Have you seen the lingerie stores here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you took your sweet time getting to your point. I can\u2019t believe you got used clothing? Girlie, that will never do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clothes are new, but I didn\u2019t pick them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they the right size?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but they\u2019re so...\u201d Zoe searched for the right word.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>Zoe gave up her mental thesaurus search and finally settled for saying, \u201cI can\u2019t dress like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you usually dress like a bohemian rhapsody gone wrong doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t shake things up a little. I can only imagine what you had picked out for your meeting and book signing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with Retro Dayz,\u201d Zoe protested. She loved the funky clothing store and all its one-of-a-kind pieces. It was also located directly across from her favorite apothecary shop in her hometown of Holland Springs.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want to convey the I\u2019m-channeling-the-musical-Hair look, not the I\u2019m-a-best-selling-author-attire. Your mother dresses younger and better than you,\u201d Martha pointed out. \u201cEven if she can\u2019t tell the difference between the softer side of Sears and Prada.\u201d</p><p>Well, neither could Zoe, but she wasn\u2019t about to admit that to her aunt. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to fuss at me or talk about your sister like that. Anyway, why didn\u2019t you tell me Ian Romanov was the big name coming out here? I thought it was Gray Campbell or Wade McGowan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you preferred Romanov out of the three.\u201d</p><p>Zoe gasped. \u201cI most certainly did not.\u201d Actually, she most certainly had. However, she hadn\u2019t thought her aunt had been listening at the time.</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly did. Besides, his schedule matched yours. When I talked with him earlier, he mentioned running into you at the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d If Martha knew about their meeting, then everyone did. She grabbed a pillow and smacked herself on the side of the head.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about you doing something stupid like getting married by an Elvis impersonator, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the world would I do that?\u201d she snapped, then sighed and tossed the pillow away. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t plan to do more than meet, greet and sign. Then it\u2019s pool and spa time for Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout tonight. Dinner at RARE, at 8:30. I want you to be seen and photographed with Romanov. Make sure you sit beside him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the world would I want to do that?\u201d She sounded like a broken record. \u201cI texted Chloe that I wasn\u2019t interest in dinner. There\u2019s no reason for me to be there. Peak\u2019s making its decision.\u201d</p><p>Martha let out a sigh. \u201cI would consider it a big favor and I can trust you. You know you\u2019re my favorite oldest niece, and an old woman like me needs all the help she can get. You will help me, won\u2019t you? We are family.\u201d</p><p>Family: the ultimate weak spot. Zoe capitulated with a sigh.\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>In her next sentence Martha was back to business. \u201cMy assistant won\u2019t be there, but it\u2019s only a schmooze-and-booze type thing.\u201d</p><p>No booze for her. She needed a clear head to get through this dinner. \u201cI\u2019m sticking with water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink whatever you like. I\u2019m more concerned with your wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick out something pretty and purple. The color brings the green out in your eyes. Go get your hair and makeup done. I\u2019ve seen the way you try to fix that horse\u2019s tail.\u201d Her aunt paused. \u201cOn second thought, I\u2019ll send someone up to you.\u201d</p><p>Zoe searched through the white bags hanging in her closet, finding a suspiciously purple wrap-dress in the first one. \u201cAunt M, did you have anything to do with my wardrobe swap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did and maybe I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for my birthday presents.\u201d Zoe let the bags fall back in place.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Martha said before ending their call.</p><p>Zoe roamed the room for a few minutes. Finally, she sat down at the desk and powered up her laptop. Quickly, she read the latest gossip website and frowned at the description of Ian Romanov\u2019s latest fling gone wrong. \u201cVivian Cross might be missing you, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>After x-ing out the internet browser and checking the time, she opened the last file she\u2019d been working on. Five hours until dinner. Five hours until him.</p><p>Maybe she should write a scene where Dimitri can\u2019t get it up and have Katrina laugh at him, then run off with Joshua. Oh yeah, that would go over really well with her fans.</p><p>She groaned, letting her head fall into her hands.</p><p>Why in the world had she agreed to come out here? To have dinner with a man like Ian Romanov? No, not a man like him.</p><p>Christian.</p><p>He was a dangerous temptation. The type of man that had no problem loving a woman then leaving her. She knew his type all too well.</p><p>If she weren\u2019t careful, she\u2019d be just as heartbroken as she had been over four years ago. She eyed the closet again and stood up. Steel crept up her spine and made her stand straighter. This time things would be different. She was different. Older and wiser, too. Without the need for a disguise that rendered her unrecognizable.</p><p>All she would have to do is be pleasant. Be polite. Pose for pictures. Be calm, cool and collected. As if she did this all the time. She nodded at her reflection in the mirrored closet door and smiled. Christian Romanov wouldn\u2019t know what hit him.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>It would have been a perfectly nice dinner if Zoe hadn\u2019t stabbed Christian before the dessert course had come.</p><p>A medic poured antiseptic over the shallow (thank God) wound on Christian\u2019s hand.</p><p>Christian alternately hissed and cursed under his breath. \u201cSorry, not your fault, mate.\u201d He sliced his gaze to Zoe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said for the fourth time, mortified at the scene she had caused.</p><p>No less than five waiters, two personal assistants and three managers jumped to their feet to gather ice, vodka for Christian\u2019s empty glass, and a first-aid kit.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t stop bleeding.\u201d One of the personal assistants narrowed his eyes at her, then let his gaze rove over Christian\u2019s body. Christian winked at him and the man beamed.</p><p>It was all she could do to not roll her eyes. The poor guy didn\u2019t realize that the movie star was nothing but an equal opportunity flirt. Unless...it didn\u2019t matter. She wasn\u2019t interested in Christian\u2019s past, present or future preferences.</p><p>Catching sight of the line of blood dried on his hand, she blanched. It didn\u2019t matter what he was, because she would be going to jail for assault. \u201cOh God, I didn\u2019t mean to, but you grabbed me and I...\u201d She knew her face was flame red. Tears pricked at her eyes and her throat threatened to close. She turned away, searching for a comforting face, or at least one that wasn\u2019t ready to do her bodily harm.</p><p>One of the representatives from Peak Pictures peered at her over his glasses, a thin smile on his face.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ambrose, I think we\u2019ve gotten all the input we needed tonight. My assistant will send Martha the details of our decision in the next couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Zoe nodded, then looked down in her lap, pleating the cloth napkin. \u201cSounds great.\u201d She needed to get a grip on herself. She was twenty-eight years old not some teenager, with her first crush who\u2019d just made a complete fool of herself. Intellectually, she knew this.</p><p>But the minute Christian had touched the inside of her thigh, she\u2019d gone soft and melted into a big puddle of Zoe goo. Her entire body had shivered and he\u2019d firmed his grip. Then she\u2019d happened to sneak a peek at him. His face was perfectly calm, betraying nothing as he\u2019d amused everyone at the dinner table with an anecdote that she\u2019d never remember. He had been perfectly unaffected by her response, like he did this type of thing all the time. So, she\u2019d grabbed her spoon to smack him with it.</p><p>As luck would have it, the spoon turned out to be her steak knife.</p><p>\u201cA \u2018no\u2019 would have sufficed,\u201d Christian said, then turned to the medic. \u201cThanks for responding so quickly.\u201d</p><p>The medic nodded, cleaned up and left.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was my spoon. I meant to smack you, not draw blood,\u201d she said, ducking her head again. Would it be weird if she banged it against the table? She\u2019d bet ten to one no one would come running to her aid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christian flexed his hand, turning to his dinner date after getting his temper under control. Zoe looked miserable and embarrassed. His anger abated slightly, but he\u2019d been sitting beside this woman for over two damn hours, keeping his hands to himself while his body jumped at every little move she made.</p><p>If she turned, so did he. If she smiled, so did he. If she licked her lips, so did he. He was like a damned teenager around her. Like an eager puppy hoping that by being all gentlemanly she would notice and pet him behind his ears. Instead Zoe had stabbed him after his legendary self-control had decided to delete itself from his amorous menu.</p><p>Under his palm, he\u2019d felt her shiver. He\u2019d heard the soft intake of air and the soft blush that appeared on her cheeks, spreading down her neck and along her chest. In that instant desire had ridden him hard. Thank God he\u2019d been on autopilot, telling a story he\u2019d previously related in interview after interview, or else he would have looked an utter fool.</p> <p>He shouldn\u2019t have touched her, not without her permission. But it wouldn\u2019t deter him from trying to gain it, no matter the uphill battle he knew he would have to endure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for yelling at you. And I promise to never criticize your novels again, or at least when I know there\u2019ll be cutlery nearby,\u201d he offered, hoping she would turn those pretty green eyes back on him. A scant second later, she gazed into his and a flash of something hit him. As quickly as it was there, it was gone. Dammit. He grabbed his napkin and tossed it on the table.</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cMy two-year-old niece doesn\u2019t even scream like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI yelled\u2014 grunted, actually,\u201d Christian insisted as her body shook with barely contained laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhatever makes you feel all manly inside.\u201d She gave him a toothy smile and his blood turned to lava.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to have my manly parts inside of you.\u201d That did not just come out of his mouth.</p><p>Green eyes narrowed. \u201cI bet you say that to every woman you meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the ones I want to sleep with.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop himself and wouldn\u2019t. He was balls to the wall when it came to her.</p><p>She swirled her glass of water around once, then set it down on the table. \u201cAccording to gossip sites you do a whole lot more than sleep, with a whole lot of women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe everything you read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m insulted you think I\u2019m like all the others. That you think adolescent pick-up lines are what women want to hear from a man.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d be more receptive if they went someplace private. \u201cCome up to my penthouse and I\u2019ll flatter you instead.\u201d Martha\u2019s warning rose in his mind, but he ignored it. He was a consenting adult, trying to hook up with another consenting adult. Hardly the stuff an agent should concern themself with in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>\u201cYour form of flattery is highly suspect, Ian.\u201d Unwrapping a mint she\u2019d dug out from her purse, she popped it in her mouth, put the wrapper on the table and glanced around the room.</p><p>\u201cI highly suspect you\u2019ll like being flattered by me. And I asked you to call me Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I never asked you to call me at all,\u201d she said, her peppermint breath tickling his nose as he leaned closer and tried to catch her eye.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you around Vegas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got other plans.\u201d</p> <p>Actually he did, but he\u2019d rather be with her. Hell, he\u2019d been ordered to be with her and the photographs they\u2019d gotten before the stabbing had been great. \u201cThey include you.\u201d He let go of her hand and held up his. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m harmless.\u201d</p><p>Zoe laughed, but it didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cIf I go out with you, then everyone will think we\u2019re sleeping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that such a horrible thought?\u201d He reached for her hand and brought it to his mouth, kissing the palm. \u201cSuch delicate hands. Most men would never suspect a knife expert lurks beneath the surface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, um, I\u2019m too old for you.\u201d She snatched it away and reached down, bringing her purse to her lap and looking extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>What was he going to have to say or do to get her to agree? It was true that he heard yes more often than no from women. He was also entirely cognizant of the fact that it had a lot to do with his fame, his money and his reputation, his good looks merely a bonus. Women (and some men) were attracted to him. They made no secret of it.</p><p>Only nothing worked with Zoe. Not his usual lines, not his celebrity status and not even compliments. She was the one cock-blocking him from hooking up with her. It made no sense.</p><p>He wanted to pound the table in frustration. Instead he calmly replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had an age limit.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look of pure disbelief. \u201cDid you actually talk to your last five girlfriends or whatever they were? They were all under twenty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut over twenty-one,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t be more than twenty-five.\u201d So, she knew about his personal life or the internet\u2019s version of it. There was no way she was as indifferent to him as she pretended to be. Unless she\u2019d been the one sending him anonymous hate mail. Although he doubted that very much. Zoe would most likely have it hand-delivered with her name in capital letters and a list of all the things that didn\u2019t meet her goal, motivation and conflict guidelines.</p><p>She tilted her head to the side, a mischievous grin appearing on her face. \u201cAre you saying twenty-five is your ceiling?\u201d</p><p>Holy hell. He\u2019d say whatever she wanted him to if she kept looking at him like that. Like she didn\u2019t want to stab him again or run away screaming. Her lashes flicked and he sucked in a breath, unable to remember when a woman\u2019s lashes held him spellbound. Hell, he couldn\u2019t remember how old he was at the moment.</p><p>\u201cSure, love, twenty-five is my limit. Can\u2019t have \u2018em hovering at thirty,\u201d he said, recovered from his momentary lapse of proper brain function.</p><p>She leaned closer and his body tensed in anticipation. Or fear. She had stabbed him. On purpose, mistaking the knife for a spoon notwithstanding. Still, she bloody meant it. Perhaps he should rethink his preoccupation with her after all.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break it to you, stud, but I\u2019m practically knocking on thirty\u2019s door as we speak.\u201d Grabbing her glass of water, she took a sip.</p><p>He blinked, then blinked again. \u201cHow bloody old are you?\u201d</p><p>Her face turned red as the entire restaurant seemed to quiet at his shouted question. To his shock, she stood, water goblet in hand, and strode away. He sat there, until the manager came by to ask if he needed anything.</p><p>After sending the man off with a tip, Christian contemplated the small bandage on his hand, remembering the searing moment as the tip of the blade pierced his skin. The throbbing was mostly gone, but his interest in Zoe was not. Rising to his full height, he went looking for her. Again.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Zoe groaned, surveying the destruction she had inadvertently caused. Potted palm trees lay prone, one on top of another like dominoes. While she\u2019d been texting Melanie about her \u201cdate\u201d, someone had come along and practically shoved her out of their way. Luckily, she hadn\u2019t gotten hurt and she\u2019d found her phone. Two for two.</p><p>A warm hand clamped down on her shoulder, making her jump. \u201cI don\u2019t care where in this hotel you hide. I will always be able to find you.\u201d</p><p>They faced each other in the mirrors along the lobby, his lean form looming over her while his blond hair gleamed under the lights. Christian looked like a movie star while she, well, Zoe looked like herself.</p><p>She sighed, then turned to face him. His injured hand fell to his side.</p><p>\u201cYou embarrassed me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou embarrassed yourself when you stabbed my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your hand, you big baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry for shouting at you. It took me by surprise\u2014that\u2019s all\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing.\u201d She patted his arm. \u201cYou must be scarred for life to discover that women actually age in the real world.\u201d</p><p>Pale blue eyes drifted lazily down her body. \u201cLike a very fine wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you just use the cheesiest line in history on me?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a disgruntled look. \u201cMy original ones weren\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try, oh, I don\u2019t know, talking to me like a normal person? Ask questions about what I like to read. Or what\u2019s on my bucket list\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping with the infamous Ian Romanov?\u201d he asked with a wriggle of his brows.</p><p>\u201cOr something as mundane as what I like to do in my free time.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a moment. \u201cWill you help me? I\u2019ve got this PR problem and need to be seen with someone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean someone like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever start a conversation with a woman using that phrase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo noted.\u201d Raking his hand through his hair, he gave her a crooked smile. \u201cI need to hang out with someone who\u2019s the exact opposite of me. Someone who\u2019s genuine and accidentally knocks over palm trees in lobbies, because she wanted to get away from an uncouth asshole who couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut or his hands to himself. Better?\u201d</p><p>Better? More like the perfect thing to say. \u201cIt\u2019s a start, but why exactly do you need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey you,\u201d a man shouted.</p><p>Christian looked over her head, his eyes widening. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Turning, she followed his line of vision. An Oasis employee trotted over, wiping at his mouth. There were sweat marks under his arms and across his ample belly. Stopping in front of them, he tugged his pants up by the waistband.</p><p>\u201cAre you stupid? The sign says don\u2019t touch the plants and that includes trees. I saw you leaning all over them on the monitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t leaning on them. Someone shoved me from behind, and I fell.\u201d</p><p>A fat hand patted down a three-haired comb-over and his beady eyes narrowed in on Zoe. \u201cYou need to leave before I call the cops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the world would you call the cops over trees? It\u2019s not like I was trying to smuggle them out of the lobby. Do you really think I can defy the laws of physics to fit one of those in here?\u201d She waved her purse in the guy\u2019s face.</p><p>Christian coughed. She turned to ask if he was okay, but he waved her off.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was gonna call the cops because you\u2019re obviously doing business in here.\u201d He smirked. \u201cAlthough I could be persuaded to look the other way with a freebie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you...you,\u201d she sputtered. Christian stepped in front of her, but she pushed him aside. \u201cI can handle this.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile appeared as he appraised her. \u201cGo for it, wildcat.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to the odious man. \u201cI don\u2019t think your boss would very happy to know you were being so ugly to guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing ugly,\u201d Christian muttered. \u201cOh, come on.\u201d</p><p>The Homer Simpson look-alike shrugged. \u201cCalling it like I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to him, love,\u201d Christian offered in his very proper British voice, the sound making her knees wobble.</p><p>She stepped out of his way. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing the squat man by the collar, Christian shoved him against one of the black columns that framed RARE. \u201cI made her fall into the trees. You will apologize to the lady, because that\u2019s exactly what she is.\u201d</p><p>Murmurs arose from a crowd of onlookers.</p><p>Christian froze, staring down at the man he\u2019d pinned against the restaurant. A you\u2019re-in-for-it-now smile appeared on the guy\u2019s face and his mouth opened. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about.\u201d But Christian needed to. How would he get out of this situation? He was quite sure this kind of publicity wasn\u2019t what his agent had in mind. The board members of B.T.S. wouldn\u2019t be amused either.</p><p>\u201cCut!\u201d Christian heard Zoe shout, then she began to clap. \u201cWell done, gentlemen. I really liked it when you, Mr. Romanov, pushed, um, him against this column here\u2014\u201d She patted the faux marble. \u201c\u2014in order to defend the lady\u2019s honor. A supremely nice touch.</p><p>\u201cYou can let him down now,\u201d she added in a hushed voice that barely reached Christian\u2019s ears.</p><p>A few people joined in, until the entire crowd was clapping along with her.</p><p>Christian watched in complete fascination as Zoe disappeared into the remaining jungle of palm trees. Where was she going?</p><p>\u201cUh, Mr. Romanov?\u201d his prisoner asked.</p><p>Christian smiled, then adjusted the man\u2019s collar before letting go. He waved to the crowd, mouthing \u2018thank you\u2019 and winking. He elbowed the facilities manager in the side. \u201cWave and look extremely happy while you do it. Or I\u2019ll rip your bloody head off.\u201d He glanced down at the name tag on the man\u2019s uniform. \u201cIs that understood, Mr. Fulner.\u201d</p><p>Frantically waving, Mr. Fulner managed to get an arm around Christian and half hugged him. \u201cToo much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Christian whispered back, smiling and nodding all the while. \u201cToo much would be my foot up your arse. Here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do: fill her entire room with flowers and the largest box of chocolate truffles you can find\u2014dark, mind you, not milk.\u201d Zoe struck him as a dark chocolate type of woman. \u201cNow, we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Fulner pulled at his collar, then shook Christian\u2019s hand and clapped him on the back. \u201cPleasure rehearsing with you, but I\u2019ve got to get back to work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrilliant plan.\u201d Christian strode to the jungle of plants and pulled Zoe out of her hiding place. \u201cHullo, beautiful. Going my way?\u201d</p><p>The crowd went wild. Cameras flashed and cell phones recorded their every move.</p><p>\u201cTell me when it\u2019s over,\u201d she whispered, her arm slipping around him. Briefly. He mourned the loss of contact when it fell away, but when she turned right, he found another excuse to touch her.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this way instead.\u201d Guiding her by the elbow, he led her in the opposite direction of the crowd. He still couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d saved him. A woman like her didn\u2019t exist in his world. Anyone else would have jumped at the chance to be linked with him, but she\u2019d practically hidden from sight the entire time. Zoe hadn\u2019t been up front, posing for the cameras and telling everyone her name. Although everyone would know by tomorrow.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. Security had stopped the crowd from following them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s safe, love,\u201d Christian said.</p><p>She looked up at him, her lips curving into a smile. \u201cThank you. It was really sweet of you to defend me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I should be the one saying thanks.\u201d Although now that he thought about it, the entire incident with Mr. Fulner was rather convenient. He wouldn\u2019t put it past his agent or his father to pay someone or someones to stage the entire thing. His gut told him that Zoe wasn\u2019t in on it. She\u2019d looked horrified that something so dreadful had happened.</p> <p>Perhaps he would do a little digging of his own into tonight\u2019s incident.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think it was right for Mr. Fulner to look like the victim when clearly he wasn\u2019t. You put him in his place and that kind of behavior should be rewarded, not treated like the next YouTube video gone viral. Besides, who doesn\u2019t know a tree is a plant? It\u2019s leafy and green,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2019s the Jolly Green Giant.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and he grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cI like hearing you laugh.\u201d For once his words weren\u2019t an attempt to hook up with her. \u201cYou did that a lot at dinner. At one point I could\u2019ve sworn you were beginning to actually like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me of that disaster. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Peak wants to call the whole thing off. How\u2019s your hand by the way?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll live to see tomorrow,\u201d he drawled, feeling slightly guilty. He hadn\u2019t thought of that when he decided to cause a big scene. Okay, so he wasn\u2019t the direct cause, but he had milked it, never considering Zoe\u2019s reputation. \u201cHowever, I was referring to Act One when you were in your element.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a big smile. \u201cYou\u2019re my hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m the villain.\u201d</p><p>Her face turned pink and her eyes shifted away, staring at the corridor in front of them. \u201cIs this the kind of the help you wanted?\u201d</p><p>Stopping at the elevators, he pressed the button for \u2018up\u2019. \u201cI want whatever you\u2019re willing to give me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cPress fifty-nine.\u201d Zoe gestured to the rows of numbers Christian\u2019s body blocked. There was no way she would reach around him. He was too close for comfort as it was. The adrenaline of their performance was quickly waning and cold reality was taking its place.</p><p>He hit the button with his elbow and moved to the opposite side of the elevator to lean against the mirrored wall. \u201cYou smell delicious, Zoe. Good enough to eat and I haven\u2019t had any dessert... yet.\u201d</p> <p>Guess the whole talking to her like she was a real person, with goals other than hooking up with him, was over. \u201cPressure Play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we talked about this?\u201d She sighed at his blank look. \u201cYou just gave me a line from one of your movies.\u201d</p><p>A small frown played on his perfect lips. \u201cHow in God\u2019s name do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty good line,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cAnd an erotic experience for any woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so full of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could be instead.\u201d</p><p>The elevator dinged and the doors opened. A man and woman stepped inside, sparing her from trying to think of a snappy comeback. The young couple looked at them, smiling from ear to ear.</p><p>\u201cYou two are so cute. Look at him staring at you. Another couple in love,\u201d the ginger-haired woman gushed.</p><p>Zoe shifted from one foot to another. \u201cOh, we\u2019re not together. He\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to her. She\u2019s totally in love with me,\u201d Christian said with a wicked gleam in his eyes. \u201cAren\u2019t you, sweetheart?\u201d He wrapped his arm around her, pulling her close.</p><p>Zoe wanted to shoot him a dirty look, but the woman looked like a puppy that had just had its favorite treat taken away. \u201cTotally,\u201d she said through clenched teeth.</p><p>Clearly mollified, the woman smiled. \u201cAren\u2019t they cute, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>Sweetie beamed at his companion, kissing her softly on the cheek. \u201cAlmost as cute as you, Mrs. Andrews.\"</p><p>Mrs. Andrews threw her arms around her husband, leaning back in the cradle of his arms. \u201cIf you think I\u2019m cute now, wait until we get back to our room, Mr. Andrews,\u201d she purred before whispering in his ear, making his eyes widen.</p><p>Mr. Andrews looked at them. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m a lucky man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d Zoe said, mentally making a note of the Andrews. Quickie wedding in Vegas would be an excellent undercover storyline for her Katrina Steele series.</p><p>Christian echoed her sentiments, but his voice didn\u2019t ring true to her ears. She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye, but he was busy playing with his cell.</p><p>\u201cOh, Perry, just wait until our families hear about this. They won\u2019t believe that we did it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t believe I met and married the love of my life after knowing you for only forty-eight hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForty-eight hours and sixty seconds,\u201d the really new Mrs. Andrews corrected before she passionately kissed her husband.</p><p>A few seconds later, the doors opened again and the now amorous couple got out without a second look at them.</p><p>\u201cI give them six months.\u201d Christian slid his phone into his pocket</p><p>\u201cUntil what?\u201d She ducked out of his side embrace.</p><p>\u201cUntil they get a divorce.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms and glared at him. \u201cWhat a horrible thing to say. They could have a long and happy marriage for all you know.\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms and glared back. \u201cAfter forty-eight hours of knowing each other? Not bloody likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it you don\u2019t believe in love at first sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. My parents have known each other their entire lives and can\u2019t stand to be in the same room for longer than five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouples fight, but it\u2019s how you make up that counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother lives in France with her lover while my father divides his time between London and St. Petersburg with his. They don\u2019t plan on making up. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d\u2014She nibbled on her bottom lip.\u2014\u201cAren\u2019t divorced people allowed to have significant others?\u201d</p><p>His beautiful mouth lifted at the corner. \u201cThey\u2019re still married.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at him for a moment. No wonder he thought what he did. With parents like his, she might be of the same opinion. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, love, not everybody lives in Pleasantville or has the fairy tale marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s romantic that the Andrews could do something so life changing on a whim. Maybe you should try it.\u201d She flung her arm out and watched in horror as her purse went sailing into his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry; it slipped. I\u2019m a bit of a klutz at times.\u201d</p><p>The side of his mouth quirked as he held the beige Coach bag out to her. \u201cI might have noticed that about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said again, her cheeks heating.</p><p>He pushed away from the wall. \u201cAnyway, who are you to lecture me about spontaneity? I bet you\u2019ve never done a crazy thing in your life. Hell, you probably sit in church every Sunday in a pure white dress, thinking pure white thoughts while some dumbass of a boyfriend is too busy to notice the naughty lingerie you\u2019re wearing underneath.\u201d</p><p>His lashes lowered over his eyes, giving them a slumberous, sexy quality as he added, \u201cAnd you do nothing about it.\u201d</p><p>Had he hacked into her email account and read her messages to Melanie? His assessment of her relationship with her ex was so close to the truth that she wanted to throw her purse at him again. On purpose and at his head.</p><p>\u201cI can be spontaneous,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou need to let me spontaneously screw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She shoved a finger at his muscular chest.\u201cYou need to spontaneously combust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not impressed,\u201d he said, catching her hand with his large one. A thrill of heat emanated from where he touched her. \u201cYou can do better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spontaneously got in here with you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>A smirk fit his lips as a teasing light entered his eyes. \u201cYeah, riding in an elevator with a man is so spontaneous. Someone alert Perez Hilton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou... you.\u201d She smacked her palm against her dress. Her purse fell to the floor with a thud, but she was beyond caring about something so trivial. \u201cYou are so irritating. You drive me insane with your cocky ego and dumb pick-up lines. You make me want to... to just... I want to...\u201d This was her chance. She could tell him exactly what she thought of him. Tell him exactly what a pure asshat he was and let him fend for himself, no matter how nicely he asked her to help him.</p><p>He leaned over, lips parted in obvious invitation and she took a small step closer. He tugged her even closer. Heat from his body touched hers. Oh, God. All thoughts of telling him anything dissolved like sugar in hot tea.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed onto one of his wide shoulders and slammed her mouth against his, almost knocking him over with the ferocity of her kiss until they fell into a corner. He remained motionless at first, letting her kiss him. Then his mouth parted and his tongue teased her lips, and she couldn\u2019t think of any reason why she hadn\u2019t let him do this at the first opportunity.</p><p>He cupped her face, tenderly rubbing her jaw with his thumbs as he broke their kiss. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t our first kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, wishing it had awakened him like Sleeping Beauty in gender reversal. Yet another reason why she had to be realistic about things. Fairy tales never came true. Happy endings never happened anywhere but in movies and books. At least not for her.</p><p>\u201cTell me where we met before.\u201d His expression was intense.</p><p>She tried to wriggle out of his embrace. \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no you don\u2019t, love.\u201d He nuzzled her hair. \u201cPlease, I want to know.\u201d</p><p>She licked her bottom lip, preparing to spill her guts, but something held her back. Mostly pride and embarrassment. \u201cDoes it really matter, Ian?\u201d She had to put a wall back up. She had to remind herself of who he was to the world and to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Christian, and hell no.\u201d</p><p>One minute she was standing and the next she was crushed against his chest as he gave her a pop-up foot kind of kiss. His mouth slanted over hers, teasing with his tongue, running it over her bottom lip until he could slide it inside again. She returned his kiss, her tongue rubbing against his and licking at the insides of his mouth. He tasted of passion and ecstasy all rolled into one.</p><p>Her body was on fire, desire shooting through every nerve ending. She couldn\u2019t get close enough to him, his hard body. His scent, his taste intoxicating. Of their own volition her arms rose, her fingers finding their way to his hair. Tugging him closer.</p><p>He moaned into her mouth, rubbing his erection against her.</p><p>Too much, too fast, her brain warned, kicking into gear.</p><p>She tore her mouth away, laying her head on his chest. His heart beat at a pace that matched hers.</p><p>\u201cPut your mouth back on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist\u2014anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Unable to help herself, she nipped at his bottom lip. \u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He cupped her shoulders, then smoothed the material of her dress as his hands slid down her back.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck, standing on the balls of her feet to kiss the side of his neck. \u201cWhat about here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be in you. Right here, right now.\u201d Cool air hit her legs as she felt her dress being tugged up. His palm slid under them hem, brushing the inside of her thigh. \u201cAre you willing to give me that?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, his tongue teased her lips open and eased inside.</p><p>She allowed him to press her against the wall of the elevator, his hard, male body a foreign sensation that she wanted to experience. Only he wasn\u2019t foreign to her, this situation was entirely familiar and she knew the consequences of giving into the temptation of him.</p><p>She made herself stop kissing him, made her arms go back to the place where they belonged, but she couldn\u2019t contain the thrills of pleasure that continued to remind her of how good things could be between them. At least physically. \u201cI can\u2019t. We have to stop.\u201d</p><p>His hands fell away, clenching into fists as he struggled for composure. She knew him that well, even if he still had no idea who she was.</p><p>Which made it all the more embarrassing.</p><p>Covering her face with her hands, she sought the solace of a corner. He caught her as she turned away, encircling her in his arms once more. \u201cAt least let me hold you, yes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She could handle this. A hug, even this sweet, wasn\u2019t dangerous. Or so she tried to convince herself.</p><p>The elevator dinged again. They broke apart like boxers in the ring.</p><p>A healthy flush covered his cheekbones. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your room, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p> <p>Kneeling to pick up her purse, she mulled over the best way to get herself out of the situation she\u2019d allowed herself to get into.</p><p>Christian tried to give her his most disarming smile, but it wasn\u2019t easy when all he wanted to do was push her up against the nearest wall and sink inside of her. He knew without a doubt that they\u2019d kissed before. Nearly every first kiss was an awkward positioning of hands and lips, but there had been none of that. They had come together like old lovers. She\u2019d known exactly where to touch him, exactly how to use her tongue and teeth to drive him insane.</p><p>For once in his life, he was bothered by the meaningless kisses he\u2019d given women, because for a woman like Zoe, no kiss was meaningless. They had been intimate before. He\u2019d bet his career on it. At what level, he wasn\u2019t certain.</p><p>Despite wanting to know, he respected her decision not to tell him. He knew all about pride and keeping up appearances. Besides, he was confident he could get it out of her later. Perhaps over a few glasses of wine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d She bit at her bottom lip and he had the urge to kiss the spot.</p> <p>He held up his hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m harmless...remember, knife lady?\u201d</p><p>She grinned, and all the tension of the moment dissipated. Taking his arm, they walked down the hallway until she stopped at her door. \u201cThis is where I get off.\u201d Eyes widening, her face turned red. \u201cDon\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d He tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cI want to see you again. Tomorrow.\u201d Actually, he wanted to see her for the rest of the night, but he wanted to do things differently with her. Take his time for once.</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me out on a date or is this more of the help you\u2019re wanting from someone like me?\u201d she asked, her eyes wary.</p><p>\u201cAbout that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that word means what you think it means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit worrying,\u201d she said with a little smile. \u201cI\u2019d like that explanation now, if you\u2019re willing to share.\u201d</p><p>If he shared everything, she might run in the opposite direction. \u201cThere are pictures of me that could negatively affect a worthwhile organization, and my\u2014our agent seems to think that changing my reputation by being seen with you would help things should the pictures go viral.\u201d Leaning closer, he breathed in the honeysuckle scent of her. \u201cI won\u2019t kiss you again, unless you ask me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes clouded. \u201cLet\u2019s keep things purely professional, okay?\u201d</p><p>No, it wasn\u2019t okay. But he had plenty of time to convince her to come around to his way of thinking. \u201cMeet me around one at the main pool. I have a private cabana and your name will be on the list.\u201d</p><p>She arched an elegant brow and he was entranced by the curve. Good God, if he stayed any longer he\u2019d be composing sonnets to it.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to pick me up?\u201d she asked with a teasing smile, then bit her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t mind flirting with you, if you think it will help. Plus, it\u2019s good for my ego.\u201d</p><p>Progress, no matter how small, was progress. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to do all night, woman.\u201d He let out an exaggerated sigh. \u201cSo, is it a date?\u201d</p> <p>She pushed open her door and walked in, glancing over her shoulder at him. \u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to wait until one to find out. Well, I had fun tonight. Sorta. It was interesting to say the least. Have a good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Zoe,\u201d he said as she smiled at him and shut the door. He heard a crash and a \u2018Good Lord!\u2019 \u201cYou okay in there?\u201d He pressed his forehead against the door as he waited for her answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fi\u2014okay,\u201d came her shout from within. \u201cStupid table got in my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, then. Good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d she called through the door.</p><p>He grinned as he walked away, hands shoved in his pockets, ignoring the pain and happier than he\u2019d been in a long, long time.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Christian glanced at the Breitling on his wrist. 12:55. He had five minutes until he saw Zoe again. Five minutes before he\u2019d find out if she would show. Five minutes until he lost his damn mind waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d Brennen was sprawled on an enormous lounger trying to get rid of a massive hangover with a little hair of the dog.</p><p>A pretty brunette with green eyes and killer wit.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Christian said, looking at his watch again. 12:57. His heart sped up as a brunette wearing a tiny bikini walked toward them, then slowed as he realized it wasn\u2019t Zoe.</p><p>Brennen laughed and then groaned, adjusting his sunglasses before pulling on a baseball cap. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of shit, but I\u2019ll bide my time. Can\u2019t wait to meet the hot piece of ass that\u2019s got you standing at attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a hot piece of ass,\u201d Christian said, earning a confused look from Brennen. \u201cI mean she\u2019s hot, but Zoe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn actual person? I thought zoe was French for awesome,\u201d Brennen said. \u201cI also thought you were out of your mind last night. How many women did you turn down?\u201d</p><p>After leaving Zoe, Christian had headed to the nightclub to meet up with Brennen and Wade. As luck would have had it, they\u2019d already become acquainted with Vanessa and the twins.</p><p>For once, he had been content to relax, smile for pictures and drink some beer. He\u2019d thought nothing of turning down a few dozen fangirls\u2019 offers of bedtime happy hour. But of course, he\u2019d told himself as he went to bed (alone), it had nothing to do with Zoe Ambrose.</p><p>\u201cAs many as I needed to. Look, be nice to her. None of your usual bullshit,\u201d Christian warned.</p><p>Brennen grabbed his chest and made a face. \u201cYou hurt me, bro. You really do.\u201d</p><p>Christian swore as he glanced at his watch again. It was past one and still no sign of her. He\u2019d been stood up and he didn\u2019t have her damn number. But he did have her room number. He motioned a pool waitress over.</p><p>\u201cYou look pissed,\u201d Brennen said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Captain Obvious.\u201d Christian heard a crash, then a \u2018whoops\u2019 and an \u2018I\u2019m so sorry\u2019. His entire body relaxed and then tensed in anticipation as Zoe came into view, wearing a bright yellow sundress and wedge shoes. Her hair piled on top of her head like she\u2019d just gotten out of the shower... or bed.</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he said to an obviously disappointed woman wearing a barely there bikini and holding a tray. She tossed her hair and sauntered off.</p><p>Zoe gave him a big smile. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Without even thinking about it he met her halfway. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m so worth it.\u201d She grabbed his hand, lacing her fingers through his as if it was something they did all the time. And he liked it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that. What took you so long?\u201d He took her bag with his free one. What in God\u2019s name did she have in it?</p><p>\u201cThanks for taking that! So, I got lost and then the chick at the desk wouldn\u2019t believe me when I said I was on your list. I needed to show ID which meant I had to go all the way back to my room to get it. Then I bumped into one of the pool waiters, but no one got hurt or covered in anything. It\u2019s the story of my life,\u201d she said with a self-deprecating smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I want you to meet a couple of my friends. If they were here...\u201d</p><p>The cabana was empty and Christian had no idea where Brennen had wandered off to. Probably he\u2019d seen something shiny. On a woman.</p><p>\u201cGuess my reputation preceded me.\u201d She let go of his hand and he frowned as he realized that he hadn\u2019t wanted her to let go.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the whole knife thing, then the palm trees,\u201d she added, making a little face. Obviously she\u2019d taken his frown the wrong way.</p><p>Setting her bag on a nearby table, he caught himself reaching for her hand, but she hadn\u2019t noticed. He flexed his fingers. \u201cI reckoned I\u2019d let that be my secret weapon if Brennen got too handsy.\u201d He couldn\u2019t stop thinking holding her hand again. Of their fingers entangling. She brushed a strand of hair away from her face and he grew hard. He wanted her hand on him, his body. One way or another he would hold her hand again.</p><p>One way or another he\u2019d make himself a doctor\u2019s appointment to have his head examined.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m yours\u2014your date, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>The wicked gleam in his eyes made Zoe flush. She wasn\u2019t his anything. Nothing but supposedly good press. Yet, she knew he wanted more. Then again, men like him, without limitations, always wanted more.</p><p>\u201cAt least for the general public, I am,\u201d she added.</p><p>The wicked gleam gave way to disappointment. \u201cThat you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a place where I can change? I was running late and had to bring my swimsuit with me.\u201d</p><p>He wiggled his brows, completely recovered. \u201cDying to see me?\u201d</p><p>She guessed being an actor had its benefits. \u201cMore like dying to see the sun. It\u2019s been freezing cold back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recover.\u201d She looked around the cabana. \u201cAnyway, place to change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you could go all the way back inside to the ladies room, or I can hold up a towel for you back here.\u201d He gave her a smile that made her body tingle, as if it\u2019d been asleep and found a reason to wake up.</p><p>\u201cWould you keep your back turned?\u201d She pulled the bikini Melanie had picked out for her out of her bag. Of course there wasn\u2019t much to it, but there were women (and men) wearing a lot less.</p><p>Christian grabbed a large towel and held it up. \u201cScout\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>Zoe gave a little shrug. She could be daring and all it-stays-in-Vegas-like. \u201cFine.\u201d She gave him her back as she slipped her panties off under her dress and her bathing suit bottom on before she shimmied out of the cotton cover-up. She didn\u2019t want to take the chance she\u2019d flash him, even if he was holding up a towel and supposedly looking in the opposite direction. \u201cAlmost done,\u201d she called out, whirling around and finding him perusing her body.</p><p>Gasping, she quickly covered her breasts with her hands. \u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t look. You said \u2018Scout\u2019s honor\u2019!\u2019\u201d</p><p>He took a step forward and crowded her into the corner, only the towel between their bodies. \u201cI lied.\u201d The heat of his body seeped through the material. \u201cYou should\u2019ve warned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you\u2019d look in a bikini.\u201d It didn\u2019t sound like he was insulting her, but she couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have my top on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to put my top on.\u201d Her nipples grew hard against her palms.</p><p>Gold-tipped lashes lowered fractionally. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, someone whistled. She rose to the balls of her feet, looking over one of Christian\u2019s shoulders. Two infamous faces accompanied by twins and a tall blonde with an annoyed look on her pretty face stood just beyond the opening of the cabana.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d She frantically searched for her top, knocking over her bag.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t see anything,\u201d Christian murmured. \u201cUnfortunately, neither can I.\u201d</p><p>She snatched the silver top from the ground and tried to secure it at the back. \u201cBut I can see them.\u201d On the second try, the hook finally grabbed the tiny slot.</p><p>\u201cYou started without me? That\u2019s totally not Zoe,\u201d one of the men called out.</p><p>She wrinkled her brow. That was strange. Who did they think she was?</p><p>Christian got a funny look on his face before he turned around, throwing the towel to the side. \u201cCut it out, Brennen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust saying what we\u2019re all thinking,\u201d Brennen said.</p><p>More than a little embarrassed at being caught topless and with Christian, she gave the group a lopsided smile and half waved as they moved closer. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell-o, Zoe,\u201d Brennen flashed a confident smile. \u201cI\u2019m Brennen.\u201d He grabbed the dark-haired man beside him and put him into a headlock. \u201cAnd this bundle of joy is my brother, Wade. Don\u2019t mind the bitch face. It\u2019s his constipated\u2014 I mean contemplative look.\u201d</p><p>Wade shook off the mock wrestling hold and gave his brother the finger. Turning to Zoe, he said, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d Zoe struggled not to laugh at the brothers.</p><p>\u201cZoe?\u201d The blonde\u2019s lips twisted on her name. She glared at Zoe, then at Christian.</p><p>He wrapped an arm around Zoe\u2019s shoulders, pulling her closer. \u201cYes, this is my good friend, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>Good friend? Oh-kay. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so Zoe to meet another one of Ian\u2019s friends,\u201d said the twin in the purple bikini.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zoe said slowly, \u201cthat\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The twin wearing a white one piece shook her head. \u201cNo, Zoe is French for awesome.\u201d</p><p>For a couple of minutes, an uncomfortable silence permeated the air. No one but Vanessa would look at Zoe. It was as though everyone was in on a joke, but her. Or maybe the joke was on her. Her face heated in increasingly humiliating levels. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLast one in the pool is, ah, screw it.\u201d Brennen scooped one of the twins into his arms and headed straight for the pool. She squealed and threw out her arms, sending his baseball cap flying.</p><p>Wade whispered in the other twin\u2019s ear, and they walked off in the direction of the bar.</p><p>Zoe slanted a glance at Christian. \u201cIs there something I should know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, well, you see,\u201d he began and to Zoe\u2019s amazement, the bridge of his nose flushed. The infamous playboy actor was blushing?</p><p>Vanessa cleared her throat, but Zoe kept her attention on Christian. \u201cIan told us that Zoe meant awesome in French, but he could have been confused from all the Petron we drank last night at Shift. Their VIP rooms were sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said that?\u201d Tears pricked at the back of Zoe\u2019s eyes when Christian didn\u2019t deny it. There were so many things she wanted to do in this moment, so many things she wanted to happen. Like holes opening up and swallowing him whole. Most of all she wanted to be anywhere but here. With him. With his entire stupid lifestyle and rude friends. She needed to be back in her hotel room, under the covers and out of sight. Why had she thought she could handle this?</p><p>\u201cZoe, let\u2019s go talk about this some place more private.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged out of his embrace. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I have work to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeaving already?\u201d Vanessa asked.</p><p>It was as if a switch had flipped. There was no way Zoe would give anyone the satisfaction of watching her flee like a scared rabbit. She\u2019d leave when she was good and ready. \u201cOh, no, I brought it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Vanessa flounced off, screeching at Wade to buy her a drink.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with them,\u201d Christian said, his voice subdued.</p><p>Zoe brushed past him, grabbing her bag and pulling out her laptop. \u201cDon\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe you an explanation. It\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say my name meant awesome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it wasn\u2019t what you think.\u201d His hand slashed through the air. \u201cThey were following me around in the bathroom and watching me shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes it so much better.\u201d She concentrated on the pool. The water sparkled in the sun and everyone else around looked like they were having the time of their lives. \u201cWhat about at Shift? Were you talking about me then, too? Or do you normally shower with Brennen and Wade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. Look, you\u2019re taking this all wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done talking.\u201d She made a move toward her bag.</p><p>Christian grabbed her hand, lacing his fingers through hers. That familiar feeling of rightness settled between them. \u201cPlease, Zoe, let me explain.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a feeling of rightness; it was a warning to run as fast as she could in the opposite direction. He was wrong for her. Incredibly, undoubtedly wrong and she was a fool to think otherwise. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you could say to make this better.\u201d She snatched her hand away, hating how her skin tingled in the exact spots he\u2019d touched.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blowing this way out of proportion.\u201d</p> <p>Shaking and clenching her teeth, it was all she could do to not tell him to shove it up his butt. After shimmying her cover-up over her bikini, she made herself comfortable in a white and green striped loveseat. All the while Christian stood there and stared.</p><p>Finally, he offered her a pillow, but she ignored it and him. With a grunt, he threw it to the back of the cabana. \u201cDammit, Zoe, don\u2019t be this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2014you\u2019re completely right about blowing this out of proportion. You have my forgiveness, even though you didn\u2019t ask for it.\u201d She glanced up at him. \u201cGo hang out with your friends. I\u2019ll stay for a little while. Maybe I can add some respectability to your reputation. It\u2019ll be totally zoe.\u201dAfter all that was his real reason for inviting her. Four girls and three guys. Someone was obligated to be the odd one out.</p><p>He searched her face. \u201cI really am sorry. Vanessa heard me say your name and got all pissed off. Instead of manning up, I told a lie and it turned into a joke. One that was never meant to be at your expense.\u201d</p><p>Too little, too late. She waved him away with her fingertips. \u201cGo play with your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe is Greek for life, and I think it\u2019s quite lovely,\u201d he said and her heart jumped to her throat. \u201cYou\u2019re lovely, and I don\u2019t deserve the time that you\u2019re giving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go, please\u201d she whispered, starting up her computer.</p><p>She watched him walk away, his usually confident shoulders drooping until he dove into the pool. Brennen jumped Christian from behind as soon as he came up for air, then shoved him back under the water. The two men played like teenagers as they tried to drown each other.</p><p>Finally, she gave up watching when it became clear that Christian wasn\u2019t coming over to talk to her. Why she wanted him to was entirely illogical. She had told him to leave her alone. But it did hurt a little. All right, if she was being honest it hurt a lot. More than she\u2019d thought. However, there was nothing she could do without seeming desperate.</p><p>She typed away, her mind not really on what she was doing. A soft thud sounded beside her. Glancing beside her, she peeked beneath her lashes. A large, pastel-colored drink with a little umbrella in it had appeared on the table. Something she would have ordered had she not been licking her wounds.</p><p>\u201cThank you for staying.\u201d Water gleamed on the tanned skin of Christian\u2019s chest.</p><p>She frowned. Why did he have to be so attractive? Why did he have to have the most perfect tattoo of a rose on his chest, one that a lifetime ago she\u2019d traced with her tongue. Her life had been just fine before she ran into him again. Boring, yes, but constant. Manageable.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019d been a fool for breaking off her engagement with Gabriel. But she couldn\u2019t second guess her decisions, not now. It had been the right thing to do, a relief from the pressure of having to be together because their relationship looked good on paper. Easing back into a comfortable friendship had made them both very happy. However, she was lonely and wanted what her best friend had. What everyone around her in Holland Springs had\u2014someone to love and be loved by. Someone to come home to and eat dinner with every night. Someone to discuss the sweetest mundane things, like picking out paint samples and debating where the next flower bed in their yard should go.</p><p>Neither Christian Romanov, the man, nor Ian Romanov, the actor, was good or realistic for what she wanted. She needed to be on guard with his easy charm. This afternoon proved the hows and whys of it.</p><p>\u201cAre you still not speaking to me?\u201d He grabbed a bottle of beer from a nearby treasure chest full of ice and drinks, then plopped down in the chair beside hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked. \u201cThank you for staying.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly, trying to not let his apology sway her determination to stay closed off to him. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever your motivation, I\u2019m genuinely happy you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d</p><p>He leaned into her line of sight, blocking her view. \u201cYou\u2019re on Twitter?\u201d</p><p>His muscular back made her mouth water. \u201cI\u2019m working.\u201d Her screen replaced the amazing view of his body. Her followers would probably love for her to tweet a poolside picture of a half-naked movie star like Christian. Forget her followers, Christian would love for her to tweet their picture together.</p><p>\u201cAll work and no play makes a dull Zoe,\u201d he teased, pushing the drink closer to her.</p><p>She pushed it back, hitting a cluster of candles. The drink sloshed over one side, and she inwardly groaned. So much for cool indifference. \u201cAll play and no work makes me broke. Could you hand me a towel?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a cloth napkin from the extras cleverly displayed in a colorful beach bucket. Instead of handing it to her, he made quick work of cleaning up her mess. Her heart did a little somersault, despite her brain telling it to stay firmly in place</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you follow me on Twitter? I could tweet our picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpf.\u201d She scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a definitive \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m more of a leader.\u201d She took a sip of her drink. \u201cBut thank you for the drink and cleaning up my mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>A waitress hurried over, taking the dirty towel from him and promising to return with another drink for her.</p><p>Motioning at her screen, he asked, \u201cYou follow Homer Simpson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI follow him, too.\u201d He grinned, then tilted his head to the side and bit his bottom lip. The gesture so familiar and endearing that she found it impossible to stay mad at him, like a sensible woman would. Apparently, sensible women were not allowed in Vegas. \u201cWhat would you say if I asked you to stay longer? We Homer Simpson fans need to stick together. Possibly form a club.\u201d</p><p>Maybe this was the way to finally talk to him about that night and the next day. Only she was too much of a coward to bring it up right now, and poolside in front of his friends wasn\u2019t exactly the right place either. One could even argue that she owed it to Christian, and that helping him would be a quick way to ease her guilty conscience. How long was too long to make someone pay for a bad deed, especially when they had no idea they\u2019d been paying all along?</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to ask to find out.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw almost dropped when he got on his knees in front of her, moving her laptop and taking her hand in his as everyone watched.</p><p>\u201cZoe, most beautiful woman in Vegas, whose name doesn\u2019t mean awesome but should.\u201d He winked at her and she couldn\u2019t help but giggle. \u201cThis most humble of servants asks, nay, begs you to come play with him in the pool. Grace us\u2014me with your presence.\u201d He kissed her hand.</p><p>She melted into another puddle of Zoe goo.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Christian nearly fist pumped the air when she agreed. It had been pure torture respecting Zoe\u2019s request to leave her alone. He had remained entirely aware of her every move, her every frown and expression as she typed and texted. As she spoke to the twins and laughed at whatever they\u2019d been discussing. As she did anything and everything to keep his attention riveted on her. Extraordinary things like breathing.</p><p>She pulled off her cover-up, revealing what he\u2019d been missing as much as her wit. She kicked off her shoes, one narrowly missing his nose.</p><p>Dangerous woman.</p><p>She shook her head. Her cheeks were stained a light pink. He didn\u2019t think it was from the sun. Her next words confirmed it. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m really not this clumsy back home.\u201d</p><p>He winked. \u201cI feel honored.\u201d</p><p>She walked toward the pool, hips swaying enticingly. Hypnotizing him with her gait, with her perfect ass that jiggled in all the right places. He swallowed a groan of appreciation.</p><p>The women he usually dated were made of sharp planes and angles that photographed well. Some men, like Wade, preferred a lean body, but Christian loved to be with women who looked and felt like Zoe. Soft and welcoming...damn near impossible to find in Los Angeles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She turned, walking in the direction of the entrance to the hotel. \u201cI have to use the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one at the back of the cabana; it\u2019s connected to a suite,\u201d Brennen called out, a shit-eating grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cI thought there wasn\u2019t any other place to change but in the hotel.\u201d She looked at Christian, her mouth forming a perfect O as understanding dawned.</p><p>Oh, hell. He was in trouble now. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her finger at him. \u201cYou\u2019re on my bad list. Way up there. All circled and starred. Maybe even underlined in red permanent marker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame a bloke for trying.\u201d</p><p>She shoved past him, giving him an extra bump with her hip. He lost his footing on the slippery surface and went over the edge of the pool. Cold water rushed up his nose and in his mouth.</p><p>Breaking through the water\u2019s surface, he shook his head like a dog. In the background he could hear Wade and Brennen laughing their asses off at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you get for not telling the truth.\u201d Zoe teetered at the edge of the pool. Her purple painted toenails had little yellow flowers in the center of each. They were cute. Sexy even. They were making him reconsider that feet weren\u2019t his particular thing.</p><p>Finally, he gave up and grinned. \u201cI might have deserved that.\u201d He grabbed her ankle and tugged. She fell into the pool and his arms with a squeal. She was only under the water for a split second before he hauled her up against his chest.</p><p>Her black lashes were spiked. Eyes the color of the forest in summer sparkled with humor when she opened them. \u201cPulling me into the pool doesn\u2019t help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think I\u2019ll get in there,\u201d Vanessa growled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll melt if she gets wet,\u201d Christian whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>Zoe laughed.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on her.\u201d Yeah, Vanessa was ambitious but she wasn\u2019t any different from anyone else trying to make it in Hollywood.</p><p>Zoe raised her brows. \u201cKylie and Megan seem nice. They came over and talked with me while you and Brennen were signing autographs. Turns out they\u2019re international business majors at NYU with a minor in French.\u201d she said, a knowing smile appearing on her face. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings. And they don\u2019t like Vanessa, but they\u2019re on Spring Break and meeting celebrities sounded fun. She was the one to tell them to act idiotic.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe next time they\u2019ll be a bit smarter about whose advice they choose to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Zoe slid down his body and into the water. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to hang out with your friends?\u201d</p><p>He searched for Wade and found him in a lounger in front of their cabana while Brennen chatted up a woman with light brown skin and hot pink hair. \u201cNo.\u201d Zoe brushed against him as she walked up the tiled incline. \u201cYou\u2019re shorter than I thought,\u201d he said. The top of her head came to the base of his neck.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been wearing heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ones from the airport are my favorite. Wear them for me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t I done enough for you?\u201dA beach ball whizzed by, smacking her on the side of the face. \u201cArg!\u201d</p><p>What the hell? He turned around as fast as the water would let him, only to see Brennen smiling innocently at them.</p><p>\u201cAnonymous drive-by throwing meant for you,\u201d Brennen said.</p> <p>\u201cYou.\u201d Christian pointed at him.\u201cWait until I get my hands around your neck.\u201d</p><p>Brennen shook his head. \u201cDo you really think telling me what you\u2019re going to do if I wait will make me stick around?\u201d</p><p>Christian swam for him, but Brennen managed to get past him. He had almost made it out of the pool when a volleyball from out of nowhere smashed him in the side of the head.</p><p>Brennen fell back, sinking to the bottom of the pool. Christian looked around to see who had knocked the prankster flat.</p><p>Zoe smiled and wiggled her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou did that?\u201d He really shouldn\u2019t be surprised. The woman had stabbed him at dinner.</p> <p>Brennen surfaced behind him, laughing and coughing.</p><p>\u201cI know how to fight dirty when I need to,\u201d Zoe said before thanking some bloke standing by the pool. She turned back to Christian. \u201cOr employ others as my minions.\u201d Her hands twisted together in parody of an evil villain.</p><p>\u201cI get the distinct feeling there\u2019s more than meets the eye when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTransformers.\u201d.</p><p>\u201cWould you please stop movie dialogue checking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you stop using them as a pick-up device.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your family. How\u2019s that for a pick-up line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me and I will.\u201d She swam away from him. Or rather she treaded water and kicked her legs. The woman wasn\u2019t remotely athletic and he found that he didn\u2019t care.</p> <p>\u201cCan I come, too?\u201d Brennen asked, rubbing the back of his head.</p><p>Christian shoved him under the water again, then followed Zoe to the shallow end and sat down on the ledge next to her. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his security team encouraging paparazzi to stay away. He directed his attention back to the woman sitting beside him.</p><p>She swung her legs back and forth in the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExercising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile seated?\u201d</p><p>Wrinkling her nose, she stuck her pink tongue out at him. \u201cLeave my vacation workout alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give up. There\u2019s no understanding the female of the species.\u201d He flicked water on her arm. \u201cStart talking about your family, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see, I\u2019m next to the oldest of six. Four brothers and a sister. My parents are still married and don\u2019t have lovers.\u201d She gave him a sidelong glance.</p><p>\u201cAre you the mother of the group?\u201d He imagined Zoe straightening ties, combing hair and fixing bows, all while her own hair was mussed and completely sexy.</p><p>\u201cI used to be, but since Carter, he\u2019s the oldest, married my best friend, she\u2019s taken over the duties. They have a little girl with another on the way. Luke and Logan are the twins. Don\u2019t get me started on their personal lives. Heath\u2019s a baseball player involved in a love triangle while Evangeline has her music and Reece. They\u2019re all extremely talented and know what they want out of life.\u201d</p><p>Her voice softened as she talked about the family she loved and obviously loved her, too. He envied her, her family, but he didn\u2019t begrudge it. Life worked out that way. It was best to deal with the hand you were dealt. Or so he tried to convince himself.</p><p>\u201cCannonball!\u201d Brennen yelled as he made a run for the pool, interrupting their conversation.</p><p>Christian moved to shield Zoe, taking the brunt of it. He spit out some water and shook his hair out of his eyes. Oh yeah, the ladies always loved it when a man spit.\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wiped the water off of her face, then laughed as Brennen did a handstand in the pool, his legs waving in the air.\u201cYour friend is such a clown. He\u2019s the like the old court jester. Seeing everything, but distracting all with his antics so they won\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyway, what about you?\u201d Christian wanted to know about her not Brennen. The man was a bloody open book. Whatever he thought, he said. No filter. No three second delay. Five second delays had been instituted because of Brennen McGowan\u2019s lack of brain to mouth filter.</p><p>Green eyes regarded him warily. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone in your family has someone and a career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d A smile wobbled on her face.</p><p>\u201cYour career is writing. So, who is your someone? Is there a man back home waiting for you? A secret lover that will be video messaging you on Skype?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have kissed you last night if there were.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the soft skin inside her elbow, pleased to see goose bumps appear. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have made you a horrible person if you were involved with someone else. Things happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings don\u2019t just happen,\u201d she said, sliding her arm away. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t need a man to be happy.\u201d</p><p>This conversation was quickly going downhill, even with the confirmation that she was entirely single. \u201cNeither do I. In fact men get on my nerves. They\u2019re sloppy. They belch, fart and scratch their balls in public. Then there\u2019s the leaving up of the toilet seat issue. Honestly, the list could go on and on.\u201d</p><p>Zoe laughed so hard that she slipped off the ledge and went under. He sighed and shook his head. She had to be the most accident prone woman in existence. After helping her back up, he grabbed one of the towels to wipe the water off of her face. \u201cZoe, love, have you considered that the outside world is too dangerous for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone is meant to have gravity work for them all of the time. I\u2019m convinced it means I would be a superior astronaut.\u201d Her eyes danced. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for one or two pesky problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLack of rocket science degree?\u201d He tapped his chin thoughtfully. \u201cOr is it the suits aren\u2019t flattering on anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow ever did you know?\u201d she asked, scooting closer to him. \u201cYour turn. I already know about your parents, but what about the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlder brother, Sebastian, and he\u2019s a pain in my arse,\u201d he said, making her laugh again. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said arse and it made me giggle a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say y\u2019all and that makes me want to shag you a little.\u201d Actually, he wanted to shag her a lot.</p><p>\u201cDo you know I can\u2019t get any regular tea out here? It\u2019s peach or raspberry or some other god-awful flavor.\u201d A delicate shudder ran through her body. \u201cY\u2019all don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing.\u201d</p><p>He knew exactly what he was missing. So did his cock. His board shorts grew tight and he leaned forward slightly. \u201cWhat made you write your first novel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had these two characters in my head that appeared out of nowhere one day. They had a story and chose me to write it.\u201d Her eyes got a faraway look to them. \u201cKatrina and Dimitri are destined to be together. No matter the odds or what side of the spy world they\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>He kind of liked that, but wasn\u2019t Dimitri the villain? \u201cI have a confession: I read your book...and liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you look like you\u2019ve eaten something vile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a girl book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s being made into a movie you want to be in,\u201d Zoe reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAs the villain.\u201d He frowned. Why was she so insistent on him playing that particular role?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my favorite character to write,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He rolled his head to one side, then the other.</p><p>She stretched her arms above her head, her breasts treading the flashing line of her silver top. If she stretched just a little bit more, he\u2019d be able to see her nipples. \u201cYou\u2019re doing really well by the way.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his eyes back to her face. \u201cEr, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no clue what I\u2019m talking about, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the slightest.\u201d</p><p>The corners of her mouth pushed up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having an honest-to-goodness conversation for a while now and you only hit on me once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI aim to please, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said in his best Wild West accent and she burst out laughing again. God, he could listen to her laugh for days on end. He would make it his mission to keep her exactly as she was at this moment: Sitting in the sun smiling, with wisps of dark hair curling around her face as she treated him like a man, not a movie star.</p><p>\u201cSaw you staring, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Heat pricked at the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have liked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Good God, could he come up with better replies than this? His so-called smooth lines were rougher than a cold reading of a script.</p><p>She held out her finger and thumb, bringing them together until they almost touched. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve exceeded your ogling limit.\u201d She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, a tiny purple flip flop decorating the lobe. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cAlmost five,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhy? Big date?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks, reddened by the sun, turned pinker. \u201cActually, yes. I met this guy in the lobby and he wanted to apologize for tripping me in the airport. He texted me while you were otherwise occupied in the pool earlier.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t in the realm of acceptable answers to his question. \u201cYou\u2019re going out with that lawyer? And he has your number? I don\u2019t have your number.\u201d She\u2019d just met the guy. He could be some homicidal maniac or, more importantly, interested in having sex with her. Besides, Christian had been interested in having sex with her first.</p><p>Holy mother of God, when had he ever thought such blatantly possessive and juvenile things about a woman?</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>She had a point, but logic be damned. \u201cGive me your number and I\u2019ll take you out instead of Mr. Brooks Brothers Suit. We\u2019ll go to one of the clubs, then hit up a bar that has fantastic VIP rooms.\u201d</p><p>Green eyes narrowed. \u201cTaylor Harper and I have reservations at Gigi\u2019s in two hours. That\u2019s what grown people do. Go out on real dates, at real places and eat real food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Gigi\u2019s is where you take a woman when you want to do things with her,\u201d Christian said, trying to ignore the darts of jealousy hitting him in the chest. \u201cOf the sexual kind,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you have a frequent diner card with them? Or a table always on reserve?\u201d</p><p>She was so close to the truth that it galled him. \u201cCancel your date.\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering him, she got out of the pool and walked toward the private cabana. Vanessa texted on her phone while Wade snored.</p><p>Christian trailed after the small, wet footprints on the tile.</p><p>After wrapping a towel around her body, she collected her belongings. \u201cThanks for inviting me to hang out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014after what happened in the elevator and today?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she picked up her bag and hefted it on her shoulder. \u201cIt was a mistake I enjoyed making at the time while today was...the two of us playing it up to the public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot buying it. You don\u2019t operate that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s how you operate.\u201d She moved to the entrance of the cabana, pausing at the opening. \u201cI can admit I\u2019m attracted to you, Christian, but I\u2019m not attracted to your lifestyle, your ideas of dating or temporarily changing your ways to get your way.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened, the pressure giving way to pain. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this to get my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen own the mistake of the pictures before they go viral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment colored her features. Her shoulders drooped a little. \u201cYou can keep my book. Consider it a gift, and I truly hope you get the part of Dimitri.\u201d Once again, she walked away from him and what he offered. She stopped, turned back and gazed at him.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Had she changed her mind? Doubtful, but hope sparked inside of him anyway.</p><p>\u201cEveryone deserves the chance to redeem themself.\u201d She shifted from one foot to the other. \u201cSo if you\u2019d still like my help tomorrow, I\u2019m available. Emphasis on the word help. Nothing more.\u201d</p><p>Relief eased the pain in his jaw. \u201cMore than I deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount on it.\u201d</p><p>He kept an eye on her as she made her way through the maze of chairs, tables and people. Ideas zoomed around in his head as he plotted. There was no way in hell Taylor Harper would be on any date with Zoe, not tonight or for the rest of his stay. No matter how Cro-Magnon it sounded, Christian had already staked his claim on her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Ian Romanov,\u201d someone squealed and he whirled around. A large group of fans rushed him, but his bodyguards quickly secured the area.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Nathan, Henry. I\u2019ve got this.\u201d A genuine smile kicked up the corners of his mouth as he greeted the people that made him famous.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Christian knocked on the hotel room door, slid the key in the slot and turned the knob. He opened the door a crack and called out, \u201cHousekeeping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you have the wrong room.\u201d Zoe appeared before him, wearing a plush robe and a towel wrapped turban style around her hair. Her jaw dropped when their eyes met. \u201cHave you lost your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes.\u201d He stepped inside and shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cGet out. I have a date to finish getting ready for.\u201d Her lips puckered liked she\u2019d just swallowed a lemon. It was becoming her signature expression when he annoyed her. He rather liked it.</p><p>Noting the absence of flowers and an abundance of clothes scattered everywhere, Christian raked a hand through his hair in annoyance. \u201cWhere are your flowers?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to one side, hands fisting on her hips. \u201cYou broke into my hotel room to ask about flowers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t accuse me of that crime, love.\u201d He waved the room key in his hand. \u201cI got this all fair and square.\u201d Nicking it from the housekeeper\u2019s cart had been good use of the skills he\u2019d learned to play a thief, and he might have already had prior practice while attending Eton.</p><p>\u201cWay to use your celebrity powers for good.\u201d</p><p>Her assumptions amused and annoyed him at the same time. \u201cWasn\u2019t my celebrity she was after, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that, Ian.\u201d She bent at the waist and shook her hair out of the towel. When she stood, it fell over her shoulders in soft, sable-colored waves still damp from the shower. \u201cYou need to leave. Taylor will be here soon.\u201d</p><p>After removing a pair of high heels and a pad of post-its from the nearest chair, Christian slouched down in it. He unbuttoned the top button of his shirt as she stared at him. Just to watch her blush, he unbuttoned the two more. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d she insisted as the room\u2019s phone rang. \u201cWho would be calling me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTaylor Harper calling to cancel,\u201d he said under his breath. Amazing what people would do with the right incentive. While she talked, Christian played \u2018Angry Birds\u2019 on his phone.</p><p>Turning, her eyes narrowed to slits. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you talked him into standing me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I point out that he called to cancel, which is entirely different than being stood up.\u201d A towel smacked him in the head when he looked down again and he lost his momentum. \u201cHey, I almost had the last pig gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares about that stupid \u2018Furious Pigeons\u2019 game. You stuck your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018Angry Birds\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Her hands fluttered in the air. \u201cAnd how would you know it\u2019s different? I bet you\u2019ve never been stood up in your entire life, you asshat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Fulner calls you a prostitute and he\u2019s being ugly while I convince a perv not to go out with you and that makes me an asshat? Jesus, woman, get your priorities straight.\u201d Christian threw the towel back at her, hitting her in the chest. The towel slid to the floor. \u201cHe\u2019d been trying to find nude pictures of you on the internet.\u201d</p><p>Gasping, she grabbed a pillow off of the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re so full of it.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, he was but he didn\u2019t give a shit. Besides, the wanker had jumped at the chance to go out with Vanessa, more than happy to cancel his date with Zoe. While Vanessa had been entirely pleased when Christian informed her that Mr. Harper was on retainer for one of the biggest producers in the business.</p><p>Zoe smacked him with the pillow.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop with the juvenile hitting? One would think a woman knocking on thirty\u2019s door would know how to behave with decorum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you sound like an asshat. For your information, I turned twenty eight last week.\u201d She thumped him again, harder this time.</p><p>\u201cStop hitting me.\u201d He shot up from his chair, dropping his phone on the bed. He grabbed her by the wrist, trying to prevent her from smacking him again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the bloody pillow.\u201d</p><p>She managed to get in another blow. He jerked her to him, one arm snaking around her back to grab the pillow from her. A sound of pure pain left her lips. Horrified, he released her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...I\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell. Sunburn?\u201d</p><p>Tears leaked from her eyes as she nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how bad until after I showered and looked at my back in the mirror. And I can\u2019t get the aloe where it needs to go,\u201d she said with a little sniff, then laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how I was going to get through my date tonight. The robe was killing me.\u201d</p><p>He gently wiped her tears away with the pads of his thumbs. \u201cLet me. It\u2019s the least I can do for being an asshat.\u201d</p><p>Zoe eyed him, wondering if this was another trick to try get her nude.</p><p>\u201cI promise to be very clinical as I go about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bottle of aloe is over there.\u201d She pointed at the small table placed beside the windows in the room. Turning away from him, she let her robe fall to her waist.</p><p>Christian cursed. \u201cI knew I should\u2019ve told you to put on more sunscreen,\u201d he said, sweeping her hair away. \u201cDo you have something to hold all this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did reapply. Megan, one of the twins, helped me get my back, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Zoe gathered her hair, taking the hair tie off of her wrist, and placed in a loose knot. She heard him open the plastic bottle and squeeze the green liquid in his hands.</p><p>\u201cThis might be a little\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cC-cold.\u201d</p><p>His fingers glided, whisper light over her shoulders and down her back. She moaned as the liquid cooled her reddened skin.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Before she could finish saying the word, he spread more aloe on her skin. Then he stopped.</p><p>\u201cBetter now?\u201d</p><p>She pulled the robe up and turned to face him. It made absolutely no sense she was disappointed he\u2019d done exactly as he promised. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He clapped his hands together. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve ruined any chance of you wanting to ever spend time with me again, I\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Taking a chance and a deep breath, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s go out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the woman whose robe was killing her.\u201d</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she strode to the closet and started pulling shirts and dresses out. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s something backless in here that I could wear.\u201d She found a dark green halter-top and held it up. \u201cAh-ha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ye of little faith. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Taking the shirt off of the hanger, she moved to the bathroom, closing the door behind her. She shrugged off her robe and hung it on the back of the door.</p><p>Crap, she forgot her skirt. Didn\u2019t matter\u2014she\u2019d get it in a minute. Slipping the shirt over her head, she bit her lip as the material scraped against her skin. She blew out a steadying breath, then quickly tied the straps behind her neck and grabbed a towel to wrap around her waist.</p><p>Christian sat in the chair near the window, playing on his cell as she entered the bedroom. \u201cTada!\u201d</p><p>Glancing up at her, he frowned. \u201cThat particular shade of green nearly matches the color of your face.\u201d He rose from the bed. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>After she did as he asked, she flashed a smile. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d Yep, she was an idiot. The shirt hurt like hell.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied with you being in pain? Hardly.\u201d</p><p>Conceding defeat, she tugged at the straps around her neck. \u201cYou can go. I\u2019ll stay here and order in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScissors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He walked around her, loosening the material of the shirt from where it hit her back. \u201cIf you had some scissors, I could cut the material down to the hem. You aren\u2019t burnt there.\u201d His fingers lightly touched the skin between her shirt and the towel. \u201cWhat\u2019s under this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery skimpy lingerie.\u201d She slammed her hand against her mouth. What possessed her to say that?</p><p>\u201cFor Taylor?\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she kept her palm pressed firmly against her lips. There was no telling what she might blurt out next.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t be for me either.\u201d</p><p>It was for herself. She loved lingerie. Sexy, trashy or classy\u2014it didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI don\u2019t have any scissors,\u201d she said, her words muffled by her fingers.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this shirt off of you, shall we?\u201d The shirt slipped over her shoulder and head, much easier this time. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, she stayed where she was. The tips of his fingers traced the edge of the towel at her waist. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cContemplating whether or not it would be worth it to pull this away. Would one glimpse of your body be worth getting kicked out of your room?\u201d The material of the towel grew tight. His breath stirred her hair. \u201cI think it would be.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, waiting for the inevitable.</p><p>There was a knock on the door. She jumped, her eyes opening.</p><p>\u201cI ordered room service.\u201d He threw the halter-top on the bed. \u201cDo you have a loose t-shirt to wear?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she moved to the dressing area and grabbed the first one she found in the top dresser drawer, then pushed her head through the opening. While Christian opened the door and talked to The Oasis employee, she changed out of her lingerie and into a pair of blue and green striped pajama bottoms.</p><p>The cotton shirt didn\u2019t hurt too badly.</p><p>She applied mascara and clear lip gloss. Yeah, she wasn\u2019t going out, but she liked the way makeup made her feel. She heard the door close.</p><p>Walking into the bedroom, she blinked at the two carts of food. \u201cHow many people were you planning to feed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t sure what you liked.\u201d Christian gestured at the bed. \u201cMake yourself comfortable. I\u2019ll be at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy every beck and call?\u201d she asked, crawling on the bed and settling herself against the fabric headboard.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His eyes roamed her body, making her entirely conscious of the fact that she was in bed, and waiting for him to join. She was also aware of the fact that she wasn\u2019t the first woman to do so, nor would she be the last.</p><p>\u201cHow will staying in my hotel room, where no one can see us, help your image problem?\u201d</p><p>He opened lids and unwrapped platters of food. The aroma made her mouth water. \u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll part of my evil plan to get you into bed.\u201d Glancing up at her, the corner of his mouth quirked. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing one of the remaining pillows on the bed, she shook it at him. \u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ll be accomplishing tonight.\u201d Their fingers touched as she traded the pillow for a glass of water. \u201cSo what are we doing?\u201d</p><p>The mattress dipped under his weight. He set two plates of assorted chocolate covered fruit beside him. \u201cLabels are important to you?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then said, \u201cWhen it comes to what I\u2019m doing or who I\u2019m spending time with? Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate covered strawberry?\u201d At her nod, he held it up to her mouth. \u201cBite.\u201d</p><p>Mouthful of chocolatey goodness, she moaned. \u201cSo good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever see the film, Two Weeks in Bollywood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He ate the rest of her strawberry, his lips in the exact spot hers had been. Then he picked up another piece of fruit. Except he didn\u2019t eat his food like a normal person, he savored and shared it with her. Offering her the first bite, taking a bite for himself and then feeding her the rest. His fingers dusting her lips, her chin and jaw each time. Desire sparked, sending heat to very specific places that remembered him, his touch.</p><p>\u201cSmall budget, even smaller release in the European market. Anyway, the main couple accidentally met at this out of the way restaurant that usually only the locals frequented, because of an order mix-up. Talking ensues. Then Ajay and Penelope end up having dinner together that night and every night for a week, getting to know one another without the constraints of their families or careers. A love affair is the direct result of said dinners. Unfortunately, he ends up dying at the end in a freak car accident while on the way to the airport to stop her from going back to London. Never gets to confess his undying love to her and she mourns him forever.\u201d He raised his brows at her frown. \u201cSorry, not a happily ever after type of movie.\u201d</p><p>Was this a warning directly from the horse\u2019s mouth? She scrunched her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m not following.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, this is a first.\u201d Grimacing, he wiped his hands with a cloth napkin. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019d like to get to know you without cameras around. I want to be able to be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everything, the dinner, in the elevator and by the pool today was an act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot precisely. In public I always have to be on\u2014good day or bad. Sick or well. Death in the family or baby born. Doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He threw the napkin on the bedside table and cleared away the empty plates. \u201cI\u2019d like to be a normal bloke for once, spending time with a woman, who despite knowing who I am, isn\u2019t with me because of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut we are together because of it. You asked me to be seen with you.\u201d No matter how tempting his words, she would stay sensible.</p><p>Undeterred, he said, \u201cThink of it as the inciting incident to throw us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>He clapped his hands, then rubbed them together and sat down beside her on the bed. \u201cBrilliant. And go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in action?\u201d At his nod, she looked around the room. She hadn\u2019t been on a date in years. Not the get to know you kind, anyway. \u201cTell me why you got into acting. What motivated you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney and women aren\u2019t enough?\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, she said, \u201cThen tell me how you get into character instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I take on a character I talk to myself in the mirror and make the facial expressions that they would. I become that person. I assume their habits, attitude, swagger, what have you, but lately, it\u2019s been getting kind of...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEasy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, easy and boring. Not that it\u2019s not challenging, but now it\u2019s more physical than mental. You know: run here, look intense. Jump on top of that and look really concerned.\u201d The bed dipped as he moved closer. \u201cAt first I only took parts for what they inspired in me and what they could inspire in others, but now it\u2019s just for the payout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever considered going back to the way things were before?\u201d</p><p>In the blink of an eye Christian was back on. \u201cAnd miss out on running into you at the airport? Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would\u2019ve avoided being stabbed.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his chin. \u201cYour version of foreplay is rather violent and bloody.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile your version of flirting is rather graphic and smug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t help what I am, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo humble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d He gave her a wicked smile and wink, then sobered. \u201cCan we stop with the acting questions? It\u2019s all people expect me to talk about. You could tell me about the first time we met.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the first man or woman in history to forget who they made out with at a New Year\u2019s Eve party, but it didn\u2019t stop her from saying, \u201cOr you could share that story since I\u2019m...what was the word you used\u2014unforgettable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201dCheeks turning red, he looked down and pulled his cell out of his pocket, playing with the screen. He acted as if he were ashamed of his behavior, only that was the problem. He was a really good actor. \u201cI\u2019ve spent most of my life drunk, high or a combination of the two. I can\u2019t remember a lot of people or the things I\u2019ve done. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I need you.\u201d</p><p>This time, the sharp pain she\u2019d been expecting didn\u2019t come. It was still there, only dulled. Manageable. Searching her brain, she tried to think of topics that didn\u2019t involve his previously hurtful behavior. Maybe this was why talking was over-rated. They needed to do something.</p><p>The carts loaded with uneaten food caught her eye. She touched his leg and his head jerked up. \u201cWant to do something fun?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is the naughtiest I\u2019ve seen you look thus far\u2014I\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest two out of three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d she laughed, white teeth flashing at him as more hair cascaded over her shoulders.</p><p>A cotton candy-colored tongue licked at her sweet lips and he had to adjust himself. Again. Make that for the five hundredth time. He would be sporting blue balls come tomorrow. \u201cNot even if I promise to let you win this time?\u201d</p><p>Talking her into playing \u2018Angry Birds\u2019 with him had been too easy. She\u2019d practically jumped at the chance. A small part of him wondered if it was because she didn\u2019t find him interesting beyond his actor\u2019s persona.</p><p>He had thought she\u2019d had fun while they\u2019d gone door to door, giving away the food he ordered. He\u2019d posed for pictures when people recognized him, and had been gleeful when they didn\u2019t. At the last hotel room, when a woman old enough to be his great-grandmother had propositioned him, Zoe had tried to save him by saying, \u201cAre you trying to take my man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, please take me far, far away from here,\u201d he\u2019d said under his breath.</p><p>Only pervert granny had invited Zoe to join in on the fun as well. Then two of her friends, men wearing black leather and ball gags, appeared at the door.</p><p>Zoe had grabbed his hand and shouted, \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d taken off, running like zombies were after them. When they\u2019d gotten back to her room, she\u2018d collapsed on the bed breathing hard and giggling. Until he\u2019d tried kissing her, then she\u2019d nearly fallen off the bed in her hurry to get away.</p><p>He sighed, then focused his attention on her as he waited for her answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really tired. At home it\u2019s almost five in the morning, not two,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLightweight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will we do next to impress the press?\u201d she asked, handing him the iPad he had sent down from his penthouse. As soon as he learned she didn\u2019t have one, he\u2019d ordered one from the nearest store. He couldn\u2019t wait for her to get it.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019ve forgiven me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOrdering things covered with chocolate helped your cause. Besides, I\u2019m a sucker for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome English actors with a big... bank account?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say the runt of the litter. You know the one that gets tossed to the side because he\u2019s not big enough.\u201d Without knowing it, her remark hit a little too close to home.</p><p>\u201cYou would choose what no one else wants.\u201d He set the iPad to the side.</p><p>She briefly touched his cheek. \u201cChristian Romanov, there is more to you than meets the public eye.\u201d</p><p>His skin felt too tight for his body and an uneasy silence settle between them. But she didn\u2019t say more. Didn\u2019t try to press him. Just looked at him with her dark eyes and waited patiently for him to decide his fate. Their fate.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with him? This was just a date. And not even a planned one. \u201cI\u2019ll take you where ever you want,\u201d Christian said after regaining his composure. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it a late birthday present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFly me to Paris and let\u2019s eat at an outdoor caf\u00e9 where they serve fancy coffee in small cups,\u201d she said with a dreamy sigh.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, I should have guessed the romance author would want to go there. Got a passport handy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, I do. Melanie\u2014my best friend\u2014must have slipped it in my carry-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant. We can go tomorrow then.\u201d He\u2019d arrange everything when he got back to his room. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, they should be in Paris before dinner.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only teasing, but...\u201d she said, her expression completely serious.</p><p>An uneasy feeling passed through him. \u201cBut what?\u201d</p><p>Her lashes lowered. \u201cI have to confess something and it might change your opinion of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubtful.\u201d</p><p>She waved him closer and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t like coffee, not even the all decorated not to taste like coffee, er, coffee.\u201d</p><p>He widened his eyes in mock horror. \u201cI can\u2019t be seen with a woman with such unrefined taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t stop you when you dated Jaylen Stone.\u201d</p><p>Not what he was expecting. \u201cYou really want to know about my past?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, plucking at the comforter. \u201cWhat would you do if she suddenly turned up again? You know, if fate threw her back into your life and things seemed different? She was different, nothing like you remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get back together with exes, especially ones that aren\u2019t truthful with me,\u201d he said sharply, making her draw back from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she apologized and had a really good reason for being untruthful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might be able to forgive, but forget is a whole other story.\u201d Grudges were championed like ancient Roman Gladiators in his family. \u201cBesides, she isn\u2019t the only woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be nice to have a choice,\u2019 she said, laying her head down on the pillow and staring up at him.</p><p>He made it easier for her and plumped up the pillow closest to him. The cool fabric under his face wasn\u2019t as smooth as his pillows. Maybe he should send some down to her. Or better yet, have her sleep over. \u201cI would think a woman like you has lots of choices. You\u2019ve got me and Taylor Harper chasing after you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the sound doing funny things to the beat of his heart. \u201cI\u2019m not a player. That would be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe politically correct term is \u2018playa\u2019 and I\u2019m not really. The most ridiculous crap is made up about me on a daily basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a minute, then said, \u201cNot too long ago, I was working on a movie in Vancouver. Every night I had dinner with the cast and because most of the time I sat beside Vivian Cross, it was reported that we were having an affair. What wasn\u2019t reported was that her husband was seated on the opposite side of her and she barely paid me any attention. They got the one shot where she asked me to pass the salt or something. Instant headlines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you believed it, too.\u201d He hoped not. For some reason he wanted Zoe to think the best about him. Her approval meant more to him than anything, almost as much as B.T. S.\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I believe. The only thing that counts is if you can live with your decisions and their consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my decision to sit next to her nearly every night.\u201d</p><p>Zoe sighed. \u201cBut it was your decision to cultivate the reputation you have. One that gives credibility to headlines like that.\u201d</p><p>She was right, yet so very wrong. \u201cVivian never had a reputation like that, not before she was seated beside me. How\u2019s that her fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think about that.\u201d She closed her eyes, dark lashes fanning to touch the tops of her cheeks. He wanted to kiss her there, then work his way down to her jaw and nibble until he found her lips. \u201cI guess everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt. That maybe what we think is the truth really isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sometimes it is exactly what it is.\u201d He was the one in those pictures, doing reprehensible things. No one had to manipulate his image.</p><p>Her eyes popped open, anxiety filling them. \u201cThere\u2019s something we need to talk about.\u201d</p><p>He panicked, thinking that she was done with him. That he wasn\u2019t worth the hassle of the press and the lies. \u201cWant to know something extremely true and possibly humiliating?</p><p>Anxiety gave way to curiosity. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI play piano and guitar by ear. And I collect PEZ dispensers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would\u2019ve thought silly candy dispensers would be so on the down low.\u201d</p><p>Silly candy dispensers? \u201cI have you know that I take my collection very seriously. Last summer, I attended the PEZ Convention in Austria and plan on going to the one in Myrtle Beach this November.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go to conventions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne must be taken seriously on the loops I subscribe to on Yahoo.\u201d He tapped his chin. \u201cI hope to find the elusive Elvis collection someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you don\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d she mumbled, then cleared her throat. \u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant idea.\u201d He could prattle on endlessly about PEZ. The history, the elusive ten, and how they should be properly displayed. He closed his eyes as her fingers traced his lips and jaw. Now his only thoughts were to keep his hands to himself. To let her take the lead.</p><p>\u201cCan you play anything you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve perfect ears.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers stilled. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean perfect pitch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the same. I\u2019m in a word: perfect.\u201d Perfectly screwed up in the head. His family was perfectly happy being estranged from one another. He opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cPerfectly full of hubris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go with the big words. I\u2019ll have to consult dictionary.com to converse with you.\u201d He rolled onto his back and shoved his arms behind his head, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>She made a pfft sound. \u201cI\u2019m not blogged about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay me,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>He felt her slide over to him until her head rested on his chest. A sign that she wanted to be touched. Slowly, he uncrossed an arm and started sifting his fingers through her thick hair. \u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was engaged until six months. His name was\u2014is\u2014Gabriel Edwards and my parents loved him. Or at least my mother did,\u201d she snorted. \u201cWho am I kidding? She still does and she\u2019s still mad at me for ruining her plans.\u201d</p><p>Wonder what Zoe would think if he told her that he was sublimely happy that she was no longer getting married. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was either him or my career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chose writing over love?\u201d Somehow, this struck him wrong. Zoe, despite her protests to the contrary, was very traditional, very romantic at heart.</p><p>\u201cWhen you love someone, it shouldn\u2019t matter what they do. Serial killers and people who make chocolate covered raisins excluded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really need to work on your sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaniel Tosh gives me all the finer points of comedy when he performs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly by his 140 characters,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYour choices are bizarre to say the least,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you still see your ex?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cFrom a small town, remember. And we keep the babies in the nursery every Sunday.\u201d Her fingers slip between the placket of buttons, stroking the skin underneath. Her touch light, but potent.</p><p>\u201cBreaking up with Gabriel was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. We\u2019re much better at being friends, always have been,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cThen why were you together at all?\u201d</p> <p>Her body tensed. \u201cHe was there for me when I needed someone the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d He meant it.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d she asked, her voice soft.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger, I was in love with a lot of women\u2014or at least I thought so. Most likely I was thinking with my manly parts,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cLike most men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there one in particular that meant more than the others?\u201d</p> <p>There had been one, but how obsessive would he sound revealing this to her? How pathetic would it sound to say that he still dreamed about a redheaded woman with brown eyes? A woman he\u2019d met at a masked ball and had known for only a few hours. Falling back on what was easiest, he said, \u201cEven if I had been sober at the time, it\u2019s been so long that I can\u2019t remember their names. They all start to blur together into colors: blonde, redhead, brunette, light skin, dark skin.\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, he wanted to snatch them back and bury them in a remote location that was thousands of miles away from Zoe\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cYou need to leave.\u201d</p><p>He sat up when she did, trying to catch her eye. \u201cI sounded like a wanker just then, trying to make you jealous.\u201d Oh that made it all better. Bloody idiot.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not jealous of any woman that\u2019s been with you. I wish them all the best: past, present, and future.\u201d She rose from the bed, then turned to face him. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>The hell it wasn\u2019t. He pushed off of the bed and walked to her, catching her chin before she turned away. \u201cSweetheart, I wasn\u2019t trying to hurt your feelings. I was just talking. Letting you get to know the real me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do me any favors. You know the way out.\u201d She practically ran to the bathroom, the door slamming shut behind her.</p> <p>He knocked on the door. \u201cCome out, Zoe. Don\u2019t end our tenth date like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a date and you can\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, we\u2019ve spent almost twenty hours together in the past two days. Let\u2019s just say that a regular date is about two hours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must do a lot of speed screwing if you have dinner first, and don\u2019t call me baby. I\u2019m happy hiding in corners and away from men like you.\u201d</p><p>Christian wanted to punch the wall in frustration, but kept his cool. \u201cAnyway, by my calculations that makes ten dates or over two months. It\u2019s well known that in the third month of courtship\u2014\u201dHad he seriously just used the word courtship in a sentence?\u201c\u2014a couple should take a trip to Paris for dinner at an outdoor cafe that does not serve coffee. Then a walk along the Champs Elysees and a kiss on the observation deck of the Eiffel Tower at midnight. Unless you choose to stab me again. Or throw me over the edge. Allow me to wear a bungee cord around my ankle, and I\u2019ll willingly offer myself as sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>He heard a loud sniff.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to make me laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you come out here and kiss me good night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be waiting a long time then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem for me. I\u2019ve got a king sized bed to keep me warm and comfy.\u201d</p><p>The door cracked open. She stuck her head out, her face splotchy from tears. \u201cYou win.\u201d</p><p>The sight tugged at his heart. He pulled her to him, careful to do so by her elbows. Which, by some miracle, hadn\u2019t been burned. \u201cIt\u2019s not a contest.\u201d He briefly closed his eyes as her full breasts pressed against him, only her loose shirt separating them. \u201cBut if it were, you would win. Hands down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think or do about you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cKiss me good night. That doesn\u2019t require much thinking on your part.\u201d</p><p>Their lips met, in the briefest, yet sweetest kiss of his life.</p><p>She blinked up at him, black lashes wet and spiky. \u201cI think I want to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Zoe stared at the ceiling, unable to sleep past eight a.m. despite the late night she\u2019d had with Christian.</p><p>She had been surprised to find that she really enjoyed being with him. He teased her, talked to her and didn\u2019t mind her klutziness. She had come so close to telling him the truth, especially after their conversation about the lies made up about him and his co-star.</p><p>But in the end she\u2019d chickened out and had become so furious that he couldn\u2019t remember something so simple as a woman\u2019s name.</p><p>Then came his apology, his kiss. Her poor heart and traitorous body had all kinds of trouble connecting the dots to fully understand what had lay before her: heartless playboy or misunderstood man. She really wanted him to be misunderstood, or to have at least grown up from the last time she\u2019d met him.</p><p>There was a knock on her hotel room door.</p><p>Rising from the bed, she grabbed her robe, tightened the sash and opened the door. Nothing prepared her for what lay on the other side. Vases of sunflowers loaded on carts came pouring into her room. Soon the blossoms overfilled her room.</p><p>At the end of the flower parade came the best surprise of all, Christian wearing low slung jeans, a graphic tee and holding an enormous box of dark chocolate truffles. He smiled at her. His eyes looked tired, but in no way detracted from his sheer sexiness. In fact it only served to enhance it.</p><p>Zoe did a little jumpy clap and then sat down on the one spot of the bed that wasn\u2019t covered in flowers. \u201cThis is the best surprise ever,\u201d she said, blushing at her idiotic move. \u201cHow did you know sunflowers were my favorite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead an interview you did.\u201d Christian\u2019s finger tapped his freshly shaven cheek. \u201cKiss me right here.\u201d She happily obliged him. \u201cGo get dressed, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so early.\u201d She stood up, then stretched. Her back was only a little sore this morning.</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep on the way.\u201d He lightly tapped her on her bottom.</p><p>She shot him a dirty look. \u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think,\u201d he said, his easy charm making her eyes roll.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d Zoe asked as the private jet took off.</p><p>Out of habit, she gripped the arms of supple leather chair, then relaxed as the jet righted itself. The interior was everything she\u2019d imagined one to be: Wainscoting and cream walls, groups of chairs placed around tables large enough to eat and play games. A large corner sofa done in a pale green looked wide enough for two people to sleep on. To her right a widescreen television displayed two soccer teams playing.</p><p>Maybe Christian wouldn\u2019t mind if she took some pictures with her phone, for research purposes. This kind of jet was exactly like the one Dimitri would fly on. Guilt pricked at her. There was no way she\u2019d ask him, nor would she take any pictures.</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked surprises,\u201d Christian said as he texted. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to beat my score at \u2018Angry Birds\u2019 while I take care of some things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fun, but I want to sleep.\u201d She leaned back and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGo to the back of the plane, first three doors on your left. I have extra clothes hanging in each closet, so if you\u2019d like to borrow something to sleep in, be my guest. However, choose your sleeping quarters wisely, because one is mine,\u201d he said, his eyes crinkling at the corner. \u201cBut no pressure.\u201d</p><p>She stood, moving in the direction of the bedrooms. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>After using the bathroom, she stripped down to her panties and searched through the closet, finding a soft yellow t-shirt. She wasn\u2019t sure if the bedroom she\u2019d chosen was his, and she was so tired that it didn\u2019t matter. She pulled on one of Christian soft tees and crawled into bed, sighing as the cool sheets whispered against her skin.</p><p>In what seemed like seconds later, she opened her eyes and found Christian sprawled out beside her. His large, lean body took up most of the bed as he slept. Gold-tipped lashes rested on his cheeks and his sensual mouth was slightly parted. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t look sweet or innocent while he slept.</p><p>Her brain told her to leave the room and find another, but her body refused to cooperate. As a compromise, she tried going back to sleep, but found it to be elusive. She must have slept far longer than she thought.</p><p>Tentatively, she reached out to trace Christian\u2019s lips and jaw line. A small sweep of his eyebrows had her complaining about men and indecently long lashes. Of course, Johnny Depp costumed as a pirate come to mind. \u201cEyeliner would look hot on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh,\u201d she shrieked, almost falling off the edge of the bed.</p><p>Saving her, he caught hold of her arm and pulled against him. \u201cHow\u2019s the sunburn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d she gulped. Her nipples grew hard, tightening to the point of pain.</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to touch you?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, her heart slammed against her chest. \u201cJust go slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of hurting you.\u201d His hand smoothed down her back, finding her butt and cupping a cheek. \u201cDoes this hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cYour turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you in my bed?\u201d she asked, squeezing her eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI meant it was your turn to touch me.\u201d Laughter rumbled from his chest. \u201cTechnically, every bed is mine since I own the plane.\u201d His lips brushed her eyebrows, then her nose. \u201cHave you figured out where I\u2019m taking you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her thigh over his. She grabbed his butt, firm and muscular from the hours of exercise he put in to stay in shape. \u201cBold move, love. I like it.\u201d Boxer briefs did little to hide his arousal as he pressed it against her. He was hard and thick. She grew wet, heated. \u201cNow, guess again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia?\u201d Opening her eyes, she slid her other hand up his muscular chest.</p><p>Rolling her to her back, he lowered his mouth, hovering it millimeters away from her lips. \u201cIs this allowed, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she exhaled on a moan as he rocked against her. She ached all over. For him. \u201cAre you taking me to Hawaii?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He nibbled on her bottom lip, still not kissing her. In fact he was driving her insane with wanting him. \u201cGuess again.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her legs around his waist. His hands slid into her hair, gently rubbing at the scalp. \u201cTimbuktu?\u201d</p><p>His teeth found her ear and bit down. Hard. Just the way she liked it.</p><p>\u201cGetting warmer.\u201d</p><p>No, she was getting hotter. Volcanic. \u201cNorway?\u201d Now his talented tongue and lips had found the hollow of her throat.</p><p>\u201cToo cold. Come on, baby, you\u2019re not even trying. Think.\u201d</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t as his hands slid from her hair and cupped her breasts, lifting them up for his pleasure. His tongue flicked out on each nipple, making her arch her back and sink her hands into his hair to draw him closer. The t-shirt she wore became wet from his ministrations. His hot mouth opened over a nipple. She cried out when he began to suckle through the cotton material. His hips moved, the hard part of him grinding into her in the most delicious way.</p><p>Her hands fell away, searching for sheets that she needed to grip. \u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he edged the t-shirt upward, baring her skin to him. He pressed open mouth kisses to her stomach, blazing a path downward. His tongue circled her bellybutton. \u201cZoe, let me take care of you. Let me touch you here.\u201d His thumb slipped under the edge of her panties, a teasing caress.</p><p>\u201cI-I...\u201d She arched into his palm as he cupped her, trembling at his touch. He licked the insides of each thigh, then bit them. Lick, nibble and bite. Over and over, he followed this pattern. Driving her to a blinding point of need, until she grabbed his head and guided him where she wanted him the most.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so wet for me.\u201d</p><p>Zoe looked into his passion-filled eyes. The satisfied expression on his face, the smile that was triumphant and tender. \u201cPlease, Christian.\u201d</p><p>His smile became wolfish and just as he eased the lace over her hips, a discreet tap on the door sounded. He paused, his fingers letting go of her and flexing.</p><p>\u201cMr. Romanov, we\u2019ve been contacted for an Angel Flight. Should I tell the pilot to decline or accept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always accept.\u201d He kissed his way back up her body, until she was trembling with desire. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this later.\u201d His mouth covered hers for a lingering kiss.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to stop.\u201d Later was no good. Later she might come to her senses. Later, he might do the same.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I, but I don\u2019t have much of a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d She kissed him again, until he was the one trembling and fisting his hands in her hair.</p><p>He growled, then turned his head, ending their kiss. \u201cStop...we have to stop. I\u2019m sorry, but an Angel Flight is for critically ill patients whose family can\u2019t afford to get them to the places they need to receive treatment. No matter how much I want you right now, I can\u2019t. Please understand.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. Finally, she managed to say, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard about you doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping other people. The press doesn\u2019t need to know everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOne last kiss, then you can let me go.\u201d</p><p>A predatory light filled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to let you go.\u201d</p><p>This time his kiss was savage, dominating. Gabriel\u2019s kisses had always been affectionate, never crossing the line, and Christian\u2019s, well, his had been urgent and passionate before now.</p> <p>But this? This was something entirely different. His hands tangled in her hair, holding her securely in place while he devoured her mouth. She gripped his shoulders, unable to contain the moans leaving her throat.</p><p>\u201cScrew it.\u201d He tugged the shirt over her head, pressing his body to her. She pushed at his boxer briefs, desperate for him be inside of her. \u201cI\u2019ve condoms.\u201d At his touch a compartment in the headboard slid open, an opened box of condoms prominently displayed.</p><p>Plunging her hand inside the box, she snagged the one first one and handed it to him. \u201cPut it on.\u201d</p><p>Foil tore, the rest of their clothes thrown to the floor. The head of his penis at entrance of her sex, his hands on her hips and his mouth...tongue plunging between her lips.</p><p>Another tap on the door. \u201cWe\u2019re starting our descent, sir. You and Ms. Ambrose should move to a seat and buckle up.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cBloody fucking hell.\u201d He rolled off of her, panting. Grabbing her hand, he brought it to his lips, then placed it over the tattoo on his chest. His heart raced beneath her palm, keeping time with hers. \u201cNot frustrated with you, love.\u201d After a couple of minutes, he left the bed, rummaged around the room and grabbed his boxer briefs.</p><p>She sat up, hair falling around her bare shoulders and down her back. \u201cI guess they knew what we were doing back here, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. My crew is compensated not to say anything. Trust me, they\u2019ve seen and heard worse,\u201d he said, buttoning the fly of his jeans. He passed her the dress she\u2019d carefully draped over a chair.</p><p>Now that she wasn\u2019t flat on her back in bed with him, Zoe could think again. And she was thinking that he was sounding like he did this all the time. The opened box of condoms was a dead giveaway. It was humiliating to be put in the same category as all the women before her. Should she feel special because he needed her longer than a single night?</p><p>But no matter how mad she was at him, it wasn\u2019t his fault. He hadn\u2019t made her do anything, only taking what she freely offered. What she had allowed.</p> <p>They finished dressing in silence, and moved to the front of the plane. Sitting in her former seat, she looked around the interior as Christian spoke in low tones to the co-pilot. A soccer game still played on the television. Her purse still sat on the floor and his phone was still in his hand. Everything was as it had been. As if they hadn\u2019t been in a bedroom, kissing, touching and stroking one another.</p><p>The stewardess, a beautiful woman with straight black hair and liquid brown eyes, placed a hand on Christian\u2019s shoulder, letting it linger as she bent down to ask him a question. He smiled at her, eyes crinkling.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s heart jumped in her throat. They were lovers. Had to be, given the way the woman was touching him. After the co-pilot and stewardess left, Christian\u2019s blue eyes found hers. He smiled, the same smile he gave every woman.</p><p>She forced a neutral expression on her face. It was time to have the ultimate talk with him. \u201cWe need to clearly define the boundaries our relationship.\u201d</p><p>Christian placed his phone on the table between them. Her look of embarrassed confusion had given way to fury. He suspected that if he touched her, she\u2019d explode. To stop himself from doing exactly that, he clenched the armrests.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she crossed her arms. \u201cWhat happened shouldn\u2019t have and it won\u2019t again. I\u2019ll help you for the rest of my stay, but no more kissing or touching or-or anything else.\u201d</p><p>Convinced he\u2019d misunderstood Zoe, he twisted his seat around to fully face her. \u201cAre you saying you didn\u2019t enjoy what we did?\u201d</p> <p>Twin blooms of pink formed on her cheeks. \u201cI liked it just fine, but this won\u2019t work. It can\u2019t work. Despite what happened between us, I don\u2019t do this kind of thing. Not like you.\u201d</p><p>Just fine? She liked it just fine? Zoe really knew how to kick a man in the balls. He was tired of her \u2018fines\u2019. Of waiting patiently for her to figure out what the hell she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not apologizing for being who I am, for having fun, or for being in my twenties. Not for a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>A shaky breath left her as the plane bounced once and then slowed. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to change who you are or say you\u2019re sorry. I\u2019m telling you who I am. I want monogamy and meaningful relationships.\u201d</p><p>That was her problem: she didn\u2019t think he could be faithful? However the media painted him, when he decided to be monogamous and in a one-on-one type of relationship, he\u2019d damn sure not have any problems accomplishing the feat. He\u2019d done it before, but everyone, including Zoe, seemed to forget that part of his past.</p><p>All of which had absolutely nothing to do with them being together while in Vegas. It wasn\u2019t as if he planned on using and discarding her. Or never talking to her again. They had the same agent for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>He leaned forward, staring directly into her pretty eyes. \u201cWhat are you asking of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing...I can\u2019t let my heart get broken again, not by you.\u201d Her lower lip trembled. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to recover this...from it.\u201d</p><p>Falling back in his seat, he twisted the platinum band around his forefinger with his thumb. For some reason he\u2019d chosen to wear it today after finding it in the bottom of his shaving case. There used to be two of them, his good luck charms when he\u2019d first started out. He\u2019d worn them to every audition that he\u2019d gotten a call-back on. Only once had they failed him.</p><p>Zoe pulled her phone out of her purse, her lips compressed tightly.</p><p>Make that twice. He took the ring off and shoved it into his pocket. \u201cI thought breaking up with your ex was a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA stupid boy pretending to be a man made promises he didn\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis actions still control your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014he...\u201d Her mouth snapped shut.</p><p>Tension shimmered between them, hanging like a heavy curtain as her mouth snapped shut. She looked as though she had revealed more than she wanted, and now he had to know who this man was. A man that eclipsed her ex-fianc\u00e9 and hurt her.</p><p>He had a sudden urge to track the guy down and beat the hell out of him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d She turned away from him, casting her attention to the window. Dark hair tumbled down her back and over slender shoulders that were shaking slightly.</p><p>He reached out to comfort her, thought the better of it and found another seat as they taxied.</p><p>Damn her.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The rest of the day passed by in a blur. Christian had procured another private jet, but instead of finishing their trip, they headed back to Vegas and to separate rooms. Without a good-bye.</p><p>Zoe fully expected him to ignore her the rest of the time he was there. She fully expected him to go out with other women who wouldn\u2019t shoot him down or insult him.</p><p>I liked it just fine.</p><p>God, his face had been priceless. He looked shocked, then hurt. It had satisfied a base need in her to injure his pride like he\u2019d done to her. However, her satisfaction was short-lived.</p><p>She cringed as she thought about their conversation before the little girl needing a heart transplant had boarded the plane with her family. But what had really gotten to her was the fact that she and Christian had exited the plane before the family got on. They never knew it was Ian Romanov, world famous actor, who was helping them.</p><p>When she\u2019d asked him about it, he\u2019d only said, \u201cI don\u2019t want them to feel like they owe me, and I don\u2019t want the press to hound them for supposed insider information. The McConnells should be given their privacy and dignity when they have a child suffering from a disease that will most likely cut her life short.\u201d</p><p>The contrast between the man he could be and the playboy he was did things to her heart that couldn\u2019t be ignored. However, it could be denied and safely tucked away in a little box.</p><p>She looked out of her window, the Vegas strip coming to life with neon lights. Only four more days to go and she\u2019d be free of him once more.</p><p>Her cell rang and she searched for it, finding it under the dresser with a necklace and yellow flower petals. The vases of flowers that had taken over her room had been sent to the other guests on her floor. Except for one. One vase she kept for herself and her memories.</p><p>She answered on the third chorus of Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cTeenage Dream\u201d. That needed to change. Maybe to Cee Lo Green\u2019s old hit \u201cForget You\u201d.</p><p>\u201cReady for your book signing tomorrow at two?\u201d Martha asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Actually, Zoe had forgotten all about it. For the first time in years, her career obligations had taken a backseat to her wants and dreams. To Christian.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the way you\u2019ve been helping Ian over the past few days. Peak has offered him the part of Dimitri and he accepted this afternoon. The contract\u2019s been signed and you\u2019re off the hook. You don\u2019t have to force yourself to be seen with the scoundrel.\u201d For once her aunt wasn\u2019t her usual hardcore self of all business and not so gentle insults.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Now it was a certainty Christian didn\u2019t need her anymore. No one did, but her fans. They were loyal and devoted. They showed up at her book signings. At her new releases. At blogs, on Twitter and in chat rooms. They had been there through the ups and downs of her career.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Zoe\u2019s reflection lifted its chin even as tears threatened to fall. \u201cA little headache. That\u2019s all. Nothing a hot bath and a good night\u2019s sleep can\u2019t cure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid something happen that I need to know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Chris-Ian is exactly what they say he is and definitely not the guy for me. So no worries of a spontaneous marriage by Elvis.\u201d Zoe tried to laugh at her own joke, but her throat tightened as if someone had grabbed it. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now. I\u2019ll recheck my email for details. Good night, Aunt M.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent. Zoe mentally pleaded with God to make Martha leave things alone. To not ask her questions that she couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYour book signing doesn\u2019t happen until two days from now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that. It\u2019s just, um, I haven\u2019t been myself lately,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest tonight and go to the spa tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me. Then I\u2019ll have the day after that to relax by the pool.\u201d</p><p>Martha cleared her throat. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve arranged a helicopter tour for you and Brennen McGowan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going out on a date with him,\u201d Zoe groaned. She was done with movie stars. Forever.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a date. It\u2019s just something fun to do with another person while you\u2019re in Vegas. Besides, you know how I like for my clients to be seen with one another. Makes us look like one big happy family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds fabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d think so. Have a good night, dearie.\u201d</p><p>Zoe ended the call, then made her way to the bathroom and turned on the spigots. She added a dollop of bubble bath, watching the white froth cover the top of the water. Once she was submerged neck deep, she let the tears fall until her eyes were swollen and her nose stuffy.</p><p>Things would look better come morning. They always did.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>Christian threw his phone on his bed, then moved to the living room on the penthouse. Near the coffee table, he found a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He hadn\u2019t smoked in months, but there were times when nothing else would do. Usually, he\u2019d find something or someone to take his mind off it his cravings. But this time, this time he didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>Giving into temptation, he grabbed both and strode across the room to the balcony.</p><p>He was furious with Zoe, with his own inaction and reaction. He knew he\u2019d hurt her with his thoughtless words about discreet employees and allusions to random women mile-highing it with him. Any other woman wouldn\u2019t have cared.</p><p>The sliding glass door that led to the outdoor pool and patio bounced as it hit the stopper in the tracks.</p><p>However, Zoe wasn\u2019t any other woman. She was a woman he wanted to know everything about, but prying into her past hadn\u2019t been the way to go. Not everyone felt a need to over-share, but with her, Christian wanted no secrets between them. He wanted to bare his soul to her and it scared the hell out of him. He was utterly out of his element with her.</p><p>Brennen swaggered in, blue highlights in his hair making Christian wince. God, he didn\u2019t know what was worse, the dye job or the wardrobe.</p><p>\u201cEd Hardy must be your biggest fan.\u201d Christian lit a cigarette and walked over to the edge of the balcony. Every piece of architecture glowing with brilliant illumination.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be hating my wardrobe,\u201d Brennen said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling all G-6, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel like a jet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means awesome. Amazing. Spectacular. Fantastic. Brill-\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the point.\u201d Christian took another drag and blew out a steady stream. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Brennen gave him his signature grin. \u201cBrainy brunette, very nice rack, round little ass and about this tall.\u201d He held his hand to his shoulder. \u201cSweet accent and dark eyes. Seriously, not your type.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ice water filled his veins. \u201cHow the fuck do you know my type?\u201d</p><p>Brennen held up his hands in mock surrender. \u201cDude, I don\u2019t care what you like. It\u2019s what the lovely Ms. Ambrose likes. I heard she\u2019s got a thing for tall, blonde and English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re Irish and blue,\u201d Christian said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the same and gets them hot all the same. Besides, I can dye my hair back.\u201d Brennen grabbed a beer from the outdoor bar\u2019s fridge. He sat down in a chair, propping his feet up on the balcony\u2019s railing. \u201cI\u2019m just fucking with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a date with Zoe?\u201d Christian could barely contain his relief at the news.</p><p>Brennen took an unnecessarily long pull of beer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a date-date. I\u2019m her personal tour guide when she goes sightseeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen does this joyous event take place?\u201d Christian snatched the beer from Brennen and threw it away, then took another drag of his Dunhill.</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow. Hoover Dam, helicopter tour and maybe a sunset picnic at the reservoir.\u201d Brennen laced his hands behind his head. \u201cI\u2019m just glad that it\u2019s not on Monday. She\u2019s got some kind of book signing and I\u2019ve got a flash mob to rock out to that night.\u201d</p> <p>Christian rolled his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re still tracking those down?\u201d</p><p>Brennen\u2019s head swayed from side to side, as if he were dancing to a beat only he could hear. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take Zoe. Women love that kind of thing. Her book signing\u2019s at two and they\u2019re not performing until eight thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she ask you out?\u201d Blowing out a thin stream of smoke, Christian ground out his cigarette in an ashtray sitting on the outdoor bar.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019m doing this as a favor to Martha. It\u2019s in the fine print of my contract,\u201d Brennen grumbled. \u201cHell, it\u2019s probably in Zoe\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should look at mine,\u201d Christian said, feeling his friend\u2019s pain. If Martha hadn\u2019t been the best at the game, Christian would have been gone a long time ago. \u201cThink Martha would mind if I took your place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave at it, mate. I hate helicopter rides.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I found out I suffer from arachnophobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear of spiders?\u201d Christian asked, completely bewildered.</p><p>Brennen nodded, his face solemn. \u201cGot that, too. Or at least that\u2019s what my therapist told me last week after finding one in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have therapy sessions in your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. I screw my therapist in her bed.\u201d</p><p>Opening the fridge, Christian grabbed two bottles of beer and tossed one to his friend. \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess this mean you\u2019re not interested in going to Ethan\u2019s house tomorrow night?\u201d</p> <p>Ethan Rivers threw the wildest, most debauched parties Christian had ever had the pleasure to attend. Anything and everything was available: women, men, drugs...the only legalities Ethan observed were no one under eighteen allowed and all transactions, as he liked to call them, had to be explicitly consensual.</p><p>It was a temptation Christian normally succumbed to every year. He had a million reasons why he should go and only two why he shouldn\u2019t\u2014B.T.S. and Zoe. In the past any reason or rule given to prohibit him from doing whatever the hell he wanted would have had him helping Ethan think of new and improved ways to find oblivion in seconds. But now...</p><p>Leaning back in his chair, he took a long pull of his beer. There were other things he wanted to do, like read the rest of Zoe\u2019s series to get into the head of her villain and run about a million miles on the treadmill in the gym.</p><p>He reasoned that he could give Zoe tomorrow to cool off so that when he showed up instead of Brennen, she wouldn\u2019t throw something at him. Like ninja stars.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve already made plans.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Zoe threw her shopping bags on the bed and plopped down beside them. Retail therapy and a trip to the spa should\u2019ve helped more than just her back. However, it had only buoyed her spirits temporarily. Not even finding a store filled with hippie chic clothing had kept her shopping high going.</p><p>Now that she was alone, she crashed\u2014figuratively and literally\u2014as she fell back on the mattress. Her cell phone buzzed again, alerting her to yet another text. She grabbed it, reading the five texts she\u2019d previously ignored and her stomach churned. Her phone rang before she could hit send on the third one. Pressing talk, she braced for her brother\u2019s lecture.</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your damn mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really know how to start a conversation, Luke,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>\u201cWhat I know is how not to beat around the bush. Every time I get online, there you are with Romanov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stay off the Internet.\u201d She winced. Antagonizing Luke was akin to waving a red flag in a bull\u2019s face.</p><p>He made an indescribable noise. \u201cSo it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>She sat up and looked around the room, searching for inspiration on how to get her brother out of her now public personal life. A copy of today\u2019s paper lay in the closest chair. She focused on the front page picture of a Wall Street executive pictured with a blue collar worker. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a publicity stunt. I\u2019m hanging out with him as a favor to Aunt M.\u201d Okay, so part of that was true.</p><p>\u201cYou expect me to believe that?\u201d he asked, his tone incredulous.</p><p>The phone beeped. She glanced at it and let out a sigh of relief. \u201cGotta go. Melanie\u2019s calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pressed talk again. \u201cOh, thank God, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill me,\u201d her brother said.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap!\" She ended the call and scrolled through her contact list to find Melanie\u2019s number. She touched the screen as soon as her best friend\u2019s picture showed up.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, that man is hot,\u201d Melanie said when she answered. \u201cI must have details. Is he a good kisser? Who am I kidding? Of course he\u2019s a good kisser. How\u2019s he in bed? You don\u2019t have to tell me. Just press one if he rocked your world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to burst your erotic bubble, but it\u2019s only a publicity stunt,\u201d Zoe repeated the words, but hearing herself saying them again actually hurt this time.</p><p>\u201cDamn. I had hoped\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Someone like Ian Romanov would date me? Please,\u201d Zoe said, ending with a little laugh. It was either that or cry a river of tears.</p><p>The line was silent for a moment. \u201cIf you need someone to talk to, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>Zoe smiled. \u201cI know, but I\u2019m okay. Seriously.\u201d She traced a pattern on the comforter, then hiked her knees to her chest. \u201cDo me a favor. Tell everyone I\u2019m fine and to not believe anything they read or see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need, Z.\u201d</p><p>After a few more stilted lines of conversation, she finally ended the call and dropped her phone. She wrapped her arms around her legs and placed her chin on her kneecaps.</p><p>Tomorrow she would have fun. Brennen seemed like the kind of guy who knew how to do that. And she wouldn\u2019t think of Christian at all, she swore silently. Not one bit.</p><p>Never again.</p><p>She froze, unable to believe her eyes.</p><p>Christian lounged against a silver sports car that somehow he\u2019d gotten permission to park on the tarmac.</p><p>The man looked like sex on a stick. All broad shouldered and lean hipped. His retro aviators and tailored clothes did nothing to help her focus. Why did the man have to look good in everything? And don\u2019t get her started on his hair. Or cheekbones. Or lips. The list could go on and on.</p><p>\u201cI thought Brennen was supposed to be here.\u201d The wind whipped at her pony tail, smacking her in the mouth and sticking to her lip gloss. Great.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got arachnophobia,\u201d Christian said, his lips twitching.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know something I don\u2019t?\u201d She felt the blood drain from her face. They were in the desert and spiders could be the size of dinner plates. Or at least in her mind they could be.</p><p>He tore away his sunglasses and took a step toward her. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get you all worked up. There aren\u2019t any spiders where we\u2019re going. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Before she could breathe easier, the pilot spoke up. \u201cThe tarantulas that like to hide under the seats in the \u2018copter just hiss at you when they get angry. I haven\u2019t had one bite a customer yet.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rounded and she looked for Christian for support. \u201cI-I,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>\u201cNeed saving?\u201d Christian whispered as the pilot went over his checklist.</p><p>The clipboard in his hand clattered to the ground. \u201cI picked a bad day to stop drinking.\u201d</p><p>Zoe\u2019s heart stuttered in response. \u201cPlease, my ride\u2019s gone back to the hotel,\u201d she whispered back, not caring her rescuer was also her tormentor.</p><p>Christian flashed a smile, his teeth white and even in the bright sun. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get a rain check, Charlie. The lady\u2019s not feeling so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jesus.\u201d Charlie gave them a small salute and pulled out a silver flask, drank deeply and weaved away.</p><p>Christian made it to the car before her, opening the passenger side door and waiting for her to slide in before he shut the door. He joined her a few seconds later, buckling his seatbelt and starting the engine.</p><p>\u201cLike my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d And probably cost more than the renovations had on her house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at her, he grinned. \u201cAdmit it: you thought it was mine.\u201d He drove the car between non-existent gates, turning onto Airport Road.</p><p>She bit the side of her lip. \u201cOkay, so I thought it was yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a nearly identical one in L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better be glad I don\u2019t have a pillow handy.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and shifted gears.</p><p>As the sports car purred down the winding road, she looked at Christian from out of the corner of her eye. He kept his hands at ten and two, only moving them to shift or find a playlist on his iPod.</p><p>\u201cYou can take me back to the hotel.\u201d She tapped her fingers against her thigh. \u201cI have work to do anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening. I\u2019ve got you all to myself and I plan to take advantage of it,\u201d he said, \u201cBesides, you owe me.\u201d</p><p>Panic assailed her, turning her body hot then cold. Had he found out? \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving your ass from Charlie, the almost sober pilot.\u201d Tension left her in one big breath of air.</p><p>\u201cI say it makes us even.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her, then back at the road. \u201cHow\u2019s your sunburn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch better. I spent the better part of yesterday at the spa.\u201d She ran her hands up and down her arms as goose bumps appeared. \u201cThose ladies are miracle workers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to turn off the a/c?\u201d</p><p>She looked out of the window, not actually seeing anything. \u201cThanks, I get cold easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZoe, love?\u201d</p><p>The car slowed to a stop and she turned to face him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers. He leaned in, his mouth dangerously close to hers. \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not,\u201d she protested, dragging in copious amounts of air in order not to pass out from his nearness. The soft brush of his lips had her gripping the leather seat to keep from touching him.</p><p>\u201cRight or left?\u201d His lips brushed hers again and he had to repeat the question before she could respond.</p><p>\u201cUm... left.\u201d Her eyes closed but nothing happened. She cracked open a lid to find him staring at her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t drive with you blocking my view of the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She threw herself back so hard that the side of her head hit the door. \u201cOw!\u201d Rubbing the sore spot, she refused to look at him as the car picked up speed.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She grabbed her purse, digging through it find her cell. \u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left my phone in my room at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re entirely at my mercy.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. Why did he have to make it sound so appealing?</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>The day was perfect for driving: Sunny, warm and not a cloud in sight.</p><p>As for his road trip companion, she looked less than thrilled at the thought of being with him. Lips shiny from gloss tempted him to stop the car and spend the next few hours kissing her, but he was going to do the right thing this time.</p><p>No matter how much it killed him.</p><p>He drove the car off onto the curb, put it park and turned to face her. \u201cI would like to apologize for my behavior on the plane. Not for what happened between us in bed, but the aftermath. I had no right to pry into your past relationships,\u201d Christian began, smiling slightly when she hmphed. \u201cFrom now on we\u2019ll do things on your terms. Whatever you want out of this relationship, you\u2019ll get.\u201d She gave him a skeptical look. \u201cPlease, Zoe. Let\u2019s keep getting to know one another. Ask me anything you want, and I\u2019ll answer you truthfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in those pictures?\u201d</p><p>He should have known she\u2019d ask something like this, but in all honesty it would be a relief to get it off his chest and for some reason he thought he could trust her. However, this wasn\u2019t something he could sit there and tell her. He put the car in gear and eased back on the road.</p><p>\u201cMe committing about a dozen crimes, but the time/date stamp has been photoshopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re fakes?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot exactly.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you release them yourself, prove what really happened and then move on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other time, I\u2019d agree with you, but there\u2019s more at stake than my career. There\u2019s this organization that has taken a chance on me and staked their reputation on my word that I\u2019ve changed. It\u2019s called Back To School or B.T.S. for short. They help kids get back on the right track.\u201d He changed lanes and blew past a silver minivan. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to start doing PSA\u2019s for them in the fall, but if this gets out\u2014not only will I look bad, they will look worse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat made you do something illegal in the first place?\u201d</p><p>She sounded a like a journalist asking him these questions, but it felt good to confess his sins to her. \u201cGot in with the wrong crowd, tried to be a badass. Whatever my brother did that pleased my father, I made certain to do the exact opposite. Eventually it caught up with me when I decided to join the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He flicked his eyes in her direction. There was no sign of judgment on her face. Yet. Taking a deep breath, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you the highlights. There was this guy, Giles, and he never liked me. He was always trying to pick a fight or just fu\u2014 er, mess with me. Usually, I shrugged it off, but that night it was my birthday and not one person in my family called. Not one. \u201d His knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel. His jaw tightened and he had to breathe in a couple of times before he was able to speak again. \u201cCan\u2019t actually blame them since I was a complete ass to be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey still should have called,\u201d she said, her voice so firm that it felt like she was on his side.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, sweetheart.\u201d He opened the moon roof with the press of a button. \u201cSo this piece of work is calling me out. Telling me I\u2019m just playing at being like them. That I didn\u2019t belong. Of course by this time, I\u2019m pissed \u2013 drunk\u2014and tired of putting up with him. I wanted to prove him wrong. So, it made complete sense to snort half of Columbia up my nose and off of some rather unusual surfaces. If it hadn\u2019t been for Sasha, my cousin, getting me out of there, I don\u2019t know what would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>That was it? He glanced at her again. There was a furrow between her brows and her teeth nibbled on her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cI warned you about the whole answering truthfully thing.\u201d Wind blew into the interior, whipping her ponytail around and obscuring her face. \u201cLook, I get it that a woman from your background doesn\u2019t want to be with someone like me. My past isn\u2019t \u2013\u201d</p><p>She laced her fingers through his and squeezed. His heart tripled its beats at the small gesture.</p><p>\u201cWe all make mistakes. And you can trust me to keep all your secrets.\u201d She placed his hand back on his thigh, but he wouldn\u2019t let go when she tried to pull away.</p> <p>Desire and comfort warred with each other. He really should take her back to the hotel. It wasn\u2019t fair to foist the consequences of his bad decisions on her. She\u2019d already done her part to make him look good.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he did a U-turn on the mostly empty interstate.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked. \u201cI thought we were going to spend the day together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what happened on the plane and what I\u2019ve admitted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn to be truthful.\u201d She shifted in her seat, facing him. \u201cI want to spend the day with you.\u201d</p><p>A grin found its way to his face and he couldn\u2019t stop smiling. It was as if the albatross hanging from his neck had been cut loose by her kiss and words. After pulling off his earpiece, he turned the car around and handed her his phone. \u201cHow about you turn off my phone and chunk it in the backseat. Today, it\u2019s just Christian and Zoe, two people who are visiting the town of, \u201d He scanned the road sign, reading the list of upcoming town exits, \u201cCoyote Hallow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>He checked his side mirror, eyes widening in disbelief as his phone crashed to the asphalt. \u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I overdid it and your phone went through the moon roof,\u201d she said as he braked hard and reached for his seatbelt. \u201cI\u2019ll pay for a new one, with an indestructible cover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It might have survived.\u201d</p><p>A semi in the opposite lane barreled by, decimating it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it survived,\u201d she said, her voice thin.</p><p>He blinked a couple of times, then got out to collect the remains.</p><p>There were tears in her eyes when he returned with the carcass of his phone. The sound of \u2018Angry Birds\u2019 gave one last hurrah and he chuckled. Then full blown laughter came rushing out. She stared at him like he\u2019d just lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Now, we\u2019re really free,\u201d he said.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Coyote Hallow was a one of everything town. One beauty shop, one general store, one police station, one diner and one gas station/taxidermy shop with the motto: \u2018We stuff while you pump. Road-kill welcome.\u2019 all crammed on one street.</p><p>Christian parked near the diner, then rushed over to open the door for Zoe.</p><p>She gave him a grin and her hand as he helped her out. \u201cThank you kind sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lady is most welcome.\u201d He wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her close to whisper in her ear, \u201cTell me when I get too handsy. Wouldn\u2019t want to break the boundaries you\u2019ve set.\u201d</p><p>She pushed him away, but grabbed his hand in her familiar fashion of interlacing her fingers through his. \u201cThe lady is very hungry.\u201d</p><p>Heads swiveled as they entered the restaurant, but for once Zoe seemed unfazed by it all and headed over to the nearest booth.</p><p>\u201cCustomer service,\u201d someone yelled as they sat across from each other.</p><p>He plucked a menu from behind a mini-jukebox and handed it to her before snagging another.</p><p>A gum-smacking waitress with big hair meandered over to their booth. \u201cWhat can I get ya?\u201d Her gum snapped, crackled and popped like the cereal.</p><p>Nodding at Zoe, he said, \u201cGo on, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a cheeseburger, well-done, fries and a chocolate shake. Hold the pickles, onions and tomatoes and can I have mayo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack cow, frog legs, hockey puck and walk it,\u201d the waitress shouted, then raised her brows at him. \u201cWhat about you, sweet cheeks?\u201d</p><p>He perused the menu while the waitress, whose name tag proclaimed her to be Betty, waited with one hand on her hip. She was wearing orthopedic shoes and had fluffy pink hair that reminded him of cotton candy.</p><p>Zoe looked under her brows at him and covered her mouth.</p><p>\u201cMake it two. No lettuce.\u201d</p><p>Betty shouted out another slew of diner lingo and walked away without another word. The noise level in the diner returned to normal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGet used to what, sweet cheeks?\u201d Her eyebrows wiggled.</p><p>\u201cVery funny.\u201d He tapped her on the nose. \u201cPeople staring when we walked in.\u201d</p><p>She drew back and scooped up their menus, dropping them into place behind the mini-juke box. \u201cThey\u2019re not staring at us because of who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what people in a small town do. They stare at people who are new in town. Heck, I\u2019ve done it.\u201d</p><p>He stretched his arms along the back of the booth, wishing he\u2019d sat on the same side as her, but it was easier this way. Easier to keep his hands to himself. Tapping her nose didn\u2019t count. Her eyes met his and she gave him a sweet smile.</p><p>His heart stopped. Her lips moved, but he couldn\u2019t make out the words.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, snapping out of his daze.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get along with Sebastian?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Betty brought their food to the table. Zoe grabbed a couple of fries while he gulped down a good portion of his shake.</p><p>\u201cYou kids enjoy.\u201d Their waitress didn\u2019t wait to see if they needed anything else and shuffled off, her cotton candy hair barely moving.</p><p>Setting his milkshake down, he tilted his head and shook it, waiting for his brain freeze to thaw before he answered. \u201cBecause he\u2019s the serious one, the golden child, etcetera,\u201d Christian said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a polite conversation with him beyond \u2018hello\u2019 and \u2018nice to see you\u2019 in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo sum it up: Christian, bad. Sebastian, good,\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s your favorite sibling?\u201d</p><p>She finished chewing the bite of her cheeseburger. \u201cThey\u2019re all my favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Smiling she took another bite of her burger. A small dab of ketchup accented the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got something right here.\u201d He swiped a finger at the corner of his.</p><p>After watching her attempt to wipe it off and somehow missing it, he leaned over and wiped it away with the pad of his thumb. She turned at the last second and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured before her pink tongue licked at her full lips.</p><p>His gut clenched in response. \u201cAnytime. Speaking of time, can\u2019t you extend your stay?\u201d There. He\u2019d put it out in the open. \u201cOr you could come out to LA and stay...with me. I\u2019ve got plenty of room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>She shifted in her seat. \u201cI don\u2019t think you and I are on the same page when it comes to relationships. And I\u2019m not trying to start a fight or argue. I\u2019m going to be perfectly honest with you, like you were with me. I need a man who\u2019s going to support my career, wants to settle down and have kids with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you seem to be at, ah, a different point in your life,\u201d she added.</p><p>Honest or not, Zoe was trying to scare him away. He was sure of it. No woman in her right mind would talk marriage to a man she\u2019d just met. \u201cI fail to see how your ultimate goals could be derailed by spending time with me.\u201d His jaw hurt from clenching it so tightly.</p><p>She grabbed his hand. A pleading look came into her eyes. \u201cHow long would I stay with you in L.A? Until the novelty of us wore off? I\u2019m not emotionally equipped for that kind of arrangement. I need permanent, not temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that worked with Gabriel.\u201d He pushed his plate away, his appetite gone.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t love him, not like\u2014\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cAh, the man-child that broke your heart. Gabriel had to pay for his sins as well.\u201d</p><p>She leaned closer, lowering her voice. \u201cThe only person that had to pay was me. And your attitude is exactly why we\u2019d never work out. Anytime you don\u2019t get your way, you fall back on insults. Grow up, Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you punish every man who dares to scale your wall of perfection. So you got screwed over, we all have.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cAt least when it happens to you, the entire world doesn\u2019t know. People don\u2019t go around writing shit about you and making money off of your misery.\u201d</p><p>Her face turned pale, her dark eyes rounding and standing out in stark contrast to her skin. Good. He hoped to God he\u2018d given her something to think about.</p><p>Betty shuffled over with the bill, her gum still snapping, crackling and popping. \u201cThere you go, sweet cheeks. Thanks for coming by. Why don\u2019t you take the wife on down to the general store and check it out?\u201d</p><p>Zoe only nodded, her lips pressed tightly together.</p><p>\u201cThanks, we\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>After paying the bill and leaving Betty a tip, they exited the diner. Zoe paused in front of the restaurant, her hands coming to rest on his chest.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not argue anymore, okay?\u201d The vulnerability on her face was his undoing.</p><p>Tugging her closer, he kissed her on the forehead. \u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cYou two looking for a place to stay the night?\u201d the cashier asked with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cEvery store in town closes in five minutes. Well, everything, but Fred\u2019s, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t planned on it,\u201d he said, knowing full well Zoe wasn\u2019t planning on it.</p><p>Christian paid for their purchases, which consisted of old fashioned peppermint sticks, a lacy fan for Zoe\u2019s niece, a PEZ dispenser in the shape of a certain infamous coyote, and a pound of fudge.</p><p>When they\u2019d first walked in Zoe had informed him that the items in here would put Cracker Barrel to shame. When he confessed that he had no idea what that was, she\u2019d looked at him with undisguised pity.</p><p>Christian heard a crash and craned his neck, finding Zoe in a corner of the store. She knelt in the floor, picking up apples and placing them back in the bowl she\u2019d obviously tipped over. \u201cAdd that to my bill.\u201d</p><p>The cashier smiled as the total grew.</p><p>\u201cSeventy-five dollars?\u201d Christian might be obscenely rich, but that didn\u2019t mean he wanted to be ripped off.</p><p>\u201cHandmade bowl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the apples?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be another twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho pays four dollars a bloody apple?\u201d</p><p>Taking Christian\u2019s money, the cashier\u2019s smile grew Cheshire Cat proportions. \u201cLooks like you just did. Anyway, the Starlight Motel is right up the street, past the jail.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed the bag and Zoe before she could knock over something else. \u201cThanks for the information.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they were outside, he unlocked the car and opened the door for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat information?\u201d she asked, sliding inside.</p><p>Shutting the door, he quickly made his way to the driver\u2019s side and got inside. \u201cThey\u2019ve a hotel if we need one.\u201d Buckling his seat belt, he gave her a wicked smile and her cheeks grew rosy. \u201cHow on earth can one woman blush so much?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d Her lashes lowered. \u201cYou make me think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaughty thoughts starring us?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, she reached for the shopping bag and pulled out a peppermint stick. She stuck one end in her mouth and chewed. Then looked at him and took a large bite.</p> <p>He shook his head and started up the car, taking note of the needle pointing to E. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, love. We\u2019re going to get gas and then be on our way.\u201d But as he parked beside the one gas tank, a harried looking man came running out with the name Fred embroidered on his grease stained coveralls.</p><p>Fred motioned for Christian to roll down the window. \u201cWe\u2019re out until tomorrow. The truck\u2019s supposed to be here around seven a.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow far is the nearest station?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two hours that way.\u201d Fred pointed in the direction they\u2019d driven from.</p><p>Ominous black clouds rolled in and fat drops of rain began to polka dot the windshield.</p> <p>\u201cThe car won\u2019t make it that far.\u201d</p><p>Zoe giggled, unable to stop even as Christian and Fred stared at her with identical expressions of \u2018what the hell?\u2019 on their faces.</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to stay here for the night,\u201d Christian said, putting the car back into gear.</p><p>As they drove in the direction of the town\u2019s only hotel, she finally stopped giggling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but this couldn\u2019t be more ridiculous. We\u2019re off the beaten path, out of gas and now a storm. I swear this is something out of a historical romance novel.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s eyes stayed on the road as the rain fell in heavy sheets, making it impossible to drive any faster than a crawl. \u201cDoes this mean I get to ravish you at the country inn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ll get struck down by the convenient twenty-four hour cold. It will be my job to nurse you back to health while the Florence Nightingale Syndrome takes effect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, when the patient falls in love with the caregiver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou novelists have strange ideas about love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHollywood doesn\u2019t? What about your last movie? You and Brianna Keene knew each other for less than a day. I mean her character, not her. Even if you were involved with her during and after. I think that\u2019s your MO. You always sleep with your female co-stars...\u201d</p><p>Icy blue eyes met hers for a moment, halting her thoughtless words. \u201cI thought we\u2019d come to an understanding, that you believed me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the car into the hotel\u2019s parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI did, I mean I do. I\u2019m so sorry, Christian. It\u2019s just that if anyone finds out about us spending the night together\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor once in your life, Zoe, stop thinking about the past and future so damned much and try living for today.\u201d He practically threw open his door. \u201cStay here and I\u2019ll get us a room.\u201d</p> <p>He sprinted through the rain, yanking the door open to the hotel\u2019s office.</p><p>She noshed on another peppermint stick. Maybe he was right, maybe she should make the best of it. Enjoy the time she had with him and when it was over, it would be over. No hard feelings and she could go back to the way things were.</p><p>If things last that long. After their argument at the diner, she could barely stand to be with herself. She was exactly the person he described. Making money off of him, without his permission. The sooner she told him the truth, the better.</p><p>A few minutes later, he ran back to the car and jumped inside, driving to the building on their left. \u201cThey had one room left.\u201d</p><p>He parked the car as close to the door as possible, but they still got soaked by the downpour. Unlocking the door, he opened it with a flourish and waited for her to go inside.</p><p>Flicking the lights on, she froze. \u201cPlease, tell me I\u2019m hallucinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Betty put something in our milkshakes.\u201d</p><p>The room was dominated by a heart-shaped bed with crimson satin covers and matching pillows. Heart-shaped mirrors adorned the walls while tiny cupids and purple candles dotting every flat surface completed the look.</p><p>He surveyed the place with a slight grin. \u201cGuess this is why it was the only one left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Valentine\u2019s Day threw up in here,\u201d she said.</p><p>A rectangular box with a slot in it caught her attention. She read the writing at the top and laughed. The bed actually vibrated. According to the label on the box, one quarter equaled \u2018five minutes of a rockin\u2019 good time\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d He moved to stand beside her.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any quarters?\u201d she managed to ask between gasps.</p><p>He stuck in two quarters and pressed the button. Nothing happened and he pressed it again. He shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cMaybe we have to sit on it.\u201d</p><p>After kicking off her shoes, she jumped on the bed and he joined her. He reached over and pressed the button, but nothing happened. \u201cShall I call the main office to complain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d She tackled him as he made a grab for the phone. \u201cThey\u2019ll think we\u2019re in here, well, you know.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he shrugged her off and she tackled him again. He reversed their positions so that she was trapped underneath him, his mouth inches from hers. The delicious weight of his body made her want to sigh in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMaking use of the honeymoon suite,\u201d he said with a mischievous gleam in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the only room available, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only room available that met my requirements.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He shot her a wicked smile. \u201cOh, I did.\u201d</p><p>Training her eyes on his lips, she wished he would kiss her already. Instead he helped her to her feet. \u201cYou can use the bathroom first. I\u2019ll go get us some snacks from the vending machine for later.\u201d</p><p>Pulling at her wet shirt, she frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to change into.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the wall, flipped on a switch and flames filled the fireplace. He picked up a nearby chair and placed directly in front of the orange flames. \u201cYou can dry them here. Robes should be in the closet.\u201d</p><p>By the time she and Christian had taken turns using the bathroom, it was almost eleven o\u2019clock, all their snacks, including the fudge, had been eaten and she was barely keeping her eyes open while they watched one of his movies.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to watch this?\u201d He made up the sofa with extra blankets and a purple pillow.</p><p>\u201cI happen to like this movie,\u201d she said on a yawn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. My first major picture and I die at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s my favorite,\u201d she said, making him scrunch his forehead, \u201cI mean, not the dying part.\u201d</p><p>He looked slightly mollified at her clarification. \u201cI should hope not. Why, exactly, do you like this movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the real you. The one I met before you became world famous,\u201d Zoe said, her eyes sliding shut. She\u2019d tell him tomorrow, when she wasn\u2019t so sleepy. On the way back seemed like a great idea.</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d came that sinfully low voice of his.</p><p>She peeked through her lashes at him. \u201cWe danced the night away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat certainly narrows it down.\u201d</p><p>She drifted off to sleep with a smile on her face.</p><p>Zoe woke up to a pitch black room and the bed shaking violently. What would make it shake? Her mind began to race. Almost West Coast. Fault lines.</p><p>Earthquake.</p><p>She shrieked and tumbled to the floor, crawling over to Christian and unsuccessfully pulling him to the carpet with her. Her heart pounded in triple time and her hands shook like crazy as she smacked at him. \u201cWake up. Dammit, wake up.\u201d</p><p>Nothing. What would it take to wake him up?</p><p>\u201cEarthquake,\u201d she screeched in his ear.</p><p>He shot straight up, the covers falling to his waist. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>She shook him again, trying to convey the urgency she felt. \u201cPlease, we have to get under something or in the bathtub. I don\u2019t know where else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything. If it was a big one, I would\u2019ve woken up before the banshee made my ears bleed.\u201d He turned away from her. \u201cGo back to bed, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep by myself,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cI\u2019m too scared.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he turned back to her and lifted the blanket in invitation. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>Wasting no time, she climbed up on the sofa and pressed herself against his chest. He wrapped his arms around her, resting his chin on the top of her head.</p><p>Unable to sleep, she searched for his tattoo with her fingers, finding the small rose above his heart.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you have got to stop. I can\u2019t take much more of your explorations.\u201d His voice was husky and tinged with desire.</p><p>\u201cAre you awake?\u201d Stupid question, but she didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the woman behind your tattoo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I\u2019m still scared.\u201d Her body shivered. \u201cHelp me calm down.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling, he caught her hand and pressed it flat over his heart. \u201cIt\u2019s not what the public\u2019s been led to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell me, I\u2019ll tell you about the man who broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was...younger, my brother and I played a naughty trick on our father, for the entire summer. The trick backfired on me, mostly because I realized how much Vladimir loved Sebastian and how little he loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you fell in love with a girl, she left after the summer was over and you got a tattoo to remember her by, only she thought you were Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am in awe of your writer\u2019s brain right now. And scared shitless that I\u2019ll somehow end up in one of your novels.\u201d</p><p>An amoeba on a flea was bigger than she felt at the moment. \u201cWho says you\u2019re not already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m not.\u201d He ran his free hand down her back. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do something like that. Stab me, yes. Malign me in print, never.</p><p>Swallowing, she tried to laugh when all she wanted to do was cry. \u201cYour tattoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father took me and Sebastian to one of his friend\u2019s house in St. Petersburg. Little did I know that Sebastian had ratted us out.\u201d Her heart pounded in her chest. She wanted to hear the rest of the story, but dreaded the ending just as much. \u201cI was held down while this old man with rotten breath inked me. Gave me a fucking rose of all things. It hurt like hell, but I didn\u2019t scream once, didn\u2019t let them know how much it hurt. When he was done, my father looked at me and my brother and said, \u201cNow you\u2019ll never be able to fool me again.\u201d\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had Sebastian tattooed as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you said younger, how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think her heart could hurt anymore than it already did for him. \u201cBut that\u2019s so wrong. Horrible.\u201d Tears pooled in her eyes. She couldn\u2019t imagine the pain, the confusion he must have felt. It was his father\u2019s job to protect, not torture. \u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did whatever Vladimir dictated.\u201d He exhaled. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone before, not the real story. Later I had it filled in with pink, just to show Vlad that I didn\u2019t give a shit about what he\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s very sexy and manly.\u201d Moving her hand away, she kissed his tattoo, then took a deep breath. \u201cMy turn: When I was younger, I met this guy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me.\u201d He rubbed the small of her back.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell someone. Not even Gabriel knows\u2014although I think he suspected...afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to keep all your secrets,\u201d he whispered, breaking through the last barriers of her pent up anger and resistance.</p><p>\u201cHe was very charming and I remember talking to him for hours, about nothing and everything. It wasn\u2019t the first time we\u2019d met or talked, but that night everything seemed right.\u201d His hands continued to stroke her, encouraging her to continue. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was the champagne or the moonlight, or what, but we sneaked away and he promised to...to\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, tears falling harder than before. \u201cHe broke my heart...I\u2019d never done anything like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me his name.\u201d His hands slid down to grip her hips. \u201cI\u2019ll find the bastard and hold him still while you stab him, through his heart. Then I\u2019ll pay someone to get rid of the body.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d The pressure from his grip increased. \u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld enough to have known better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>Apparently, he\u2019d been broken and messed up in ways she couldn\u2019t imagine. Not that she excused his broken promise, but she better understood it. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more control over you, or your decisions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She stretched her body, relishing the feel of his against it. \u201cI\u2019m free to do whatever I want.\u201d</p><p>He growled a little. \u201cI think that\u2019s very sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d She wanted to be with him in every way possible. The past was just that, the past. Holding on to her anger and pain did nothing for her, only served to punish those who tried to get close.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I kiss you, I\u2019m not going to stop, and I don\u2019t want to be a pity fuck.\u201d</p><p>That was the last thing she expected him to say or think. \u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>His body shook and tensed, as if he was exerting great control over it and it didn\u2019t want to obey. \u201cLook, I want to do things the right way with you, not in a seedy motel where we\u2019re both feeling things that might or might not be real. And that\u2019s what I need most of all\u2014real.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA speech like that could make a woman fall in love with you, Christian.\u201d Too bad that woman was her and she was leaving in two days.</p><p>\u201cMaybe some women, but not you.\u201d She didn\u2019t know whether to take that as a compliment or an insult. Or maybe it had nothing to do with her.</p><p>There was a loud buzzing sound, almost like bees in a hive. In the darkened room she just could make out the bed as it shook, the covers tumbling to the floor. \u201cFive minutes for a rockin\u2019 good time,\u201d she said to herself, thankful for the darkness. He could think she was a dumbass, but at least he couldn\u2019t see her as one. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an earthquake. It was the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it was.\u201d He barked out a laugh. \u201cGo sleep, love. It\u2019s almost three-thirty and we need to be out of this town by seven to get you back in time for your book signing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrennen told me. How do you think I found out about your helicopter tour?\u201d He tucked her against him, falling asleep in what seemed like minutes while she remained completely awake.</p><p>The next morning, after dressing in silence, he took her back to the diner where Betty waited on them. It was the fastest and quietest meal of her life.</p><p>On the drive back, Zoe tried engaging Christian in conversation but his answers were limited to grunts and yes or no.</p><p>In her experience (and she had four brothers to confirm this), most men were cranky when they were hungry or lacked sex. Judging by what happened last night and the hearty meal he\u2019d scarfed down at breakfast, she knew which one was making him cranky.</p><p>With that in mind, she gave up, closed her eyes and slept the rest of the way back to the hotel until Christian woke her up. \u201cWe\u2019re here, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>She yawned and stretched, giving him a funny look when he sat there and stared at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you punishing me for trying to do the right thing?\u201d His eyes flicked down to her chest. The material of her turquoise shirt strained against her breasts.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Flustered, she picked up her purse, then opened the car door. His hand on her arm stopped her from getting out.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to kiss me good-bye?\u201d he asked when she turned to face him. \u201cWell, not good-bye exactly. How about kiss me until later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, well, I figured you didn\u2019t want to, ah, I\u2019m no good at this,\u201d she said, hiking her purse higher. \u201cI can\u2019t be all sophisticated and glib about the whole about-last-night-conversation we may or may not need to continue.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAnd that is one of the very lovely qualities you posses that makes me want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she couldn\u2019t close her eyes when his lips found hers, kissing her softly.</p><p>\u201cForgive me for being a horrible riding companion?\u201d He batted his baby blues at her.</p><p>She was such a sucker. \u201cI forgive you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll come by your room later,\u201d he promised.</p><p>As Zoe got out of the car, she could feel his eyes on her, but she didn\u2019t dare turn around. The paparazzi were already buzzing around her and it would only grow worse if she did.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Christian heard them before he saw them. Hundreds of fans had lined up to get one of Zoe\u2019s autographed books, but they weren\u2019t the only ones there. Reporters from major gossip channels and magazines jostled for their turn to ask Zoe personal questions about him.</p><p>This was no ordinary book signing.</p><p>In fact, it was supposed to have taken place in the bookstore in shopping wing of The Oasis. Apparently, the crowd wanted more than a signed book. They wanted gossip and for him to show up. Which he had and now regretted, because he didn\u2019t want to cause problems or draw attention away from Zoe on her day.</p><p>\u201cMs. Ambrose, is it true that you\u2019re dating Ian Romanov strictly for the press it would bring your books and upcoming movie?\u201d</p><p>Zoe smiled, but it didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. Christian wanted to run up there to save her, but he knew his presence would most likely cause pandemonium. It was why he stood in a corner, wearing a baseball hat and keeping his head down.</p><p>\u201cO.M.G! It\u2019s you,\u201d a woman squealed.</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cAnd who would that be?\u201d he asked, affecting a mid-western accent. \u201cOh, you think I\u2019m... Man, I get this all the time. I hate to burst your bubble, but I am not that guy.\u201d Hopefully, she would leave so he could concentrate on Zoe\u2019s book signing turned press conference.</p><p>Bright pink lips made a moue as her glittery lashes fluttered at him. \u201cThat really bites.\u201d She tossed hair streaked with purple highlights. Harajuku girls had nothing on this Hello Kitty lover. Too bad Brennen wasn\u2019t with him. \u201cYou\u2019re better looking than he is anyway. I\u2019m A.J. and totally want to buy you a drink.\u201d</p><p>He listened to her with half an ear as Zoe\u2019s answer drifted over to him.</p><p>\u201cHave you actually seen Ian Romanov? Who would date him for strictly business reasons?\u201d Zoe asked with a crooked smile. That remark had some in the crowd laughing, but a few weren\u2019t entirely convinced.</p><p>\u201cSo maybe you\u2019re mixing business with pleasure. It\u2019s rather convenient he\u2019s the male lead and you had a major say in casting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing photographed with him hardly makes us a couple. I was also photographed with the McGowan brothers and no one\u2019s asking me if I\u2019m dating either of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you haven\u2019t gotten around to it.\u201d Another journalist piped up. \u201cWe\u2019ll be sure to check out casting for any sequels that might be made.\u201d</p><p>Christian clenched his fists.</p><p>Ed Willis was the worst sort of journalist. Actually, using the term journalist to describe Willis stretched the definition to its breaking point. The fox-faced man made Christian\u2019s skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cHel-lo, I\u2019m trying to pick you up.\u201d A.J.\u2019s breasts brushed against his arm.</p><p>He stepped back to avoid another \u201caccidental\u201d bump. A.J. was very attractive. He would go as far as saying she was a head turner. Normally, this kind of attention would be very much welcomed and completely thanked in the manner in which he excelled.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t Zoe.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t interested in the least.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m otherwise engaged,\u201d he replied, focusing his attention on the sable haired woman behind the table.</p><p>A.J whirled away. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, bless your heart,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>He supposed that was code for \u2018screw you, buddy\u2019, but he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t life be all dull if we didn\u2019t have pleasure? That\u2019s why I write my books-for my pleasure and hopefully my fans. Now, who can I make this out to?\u201d Zoe\u2019s smile stayed firmly in place as she gripped the book in front of her.</p><p>So damned impressed by her, he wanted to clap and whistle. Hell, he was in awe of the way she had handled the situation.</p><p>To his immediate left, a group of guys argued over who was next in line at a nearby slot machine. The next thing he knew, one had thrown a punch. A woman screamed as chairs went flying through the air. Chairs that were from the book signing. He craned his head, looking through the crowd for Zoe.</p><p>He found her behind the table, face white as she searched the area. For him? It didn\u2019t matter. He had to get to her. Plunging through the mass of bodies, he ducked a fist and shoved men out of the way in his hurry. A sharp jab to his side had him grimacing and cursing. Hands grabbed at his shirt, trying to pull him into the center of the brawl.</p><p>A potted plant narrowly missed hitting Zoe\u2019s shoulder. He punched the asshole touching him and jumped over chairs and the ropes that had contained the crowd.</p><p>People swarmed her table, knocking it over and sending her books to the floor. She tripped trying to get out of the way and a man twice her size fell on top of her. She staggered to her feet.</p><p>What he saw had icy fear clawing at him. Her dress had been torn and half her hair hung in her eyes. \u201cZoe,\u201d he shouted, but the crashing furniture and yelling drowned him out.</p><p>Security flooded the area, obscuring his view of her for only a minute, but it was enough time for her to disappear.</p><p>A flash of her orange dress caught his eye and he followed, watching as a tall man in a dark suit guided Zoe by the elbow. He hoped the guy was security.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s flushed face appeared, catching his eye as he neared and her body seemed to visibly relax. \u201cChristian.\u201d She pushed at her escort as she tried to get away from him. \u201cStop, please. It\u2019s my... He\u2019s my... Christian.\u201d</p><p>The man in a three-piece suit bent closer, his mouth moving, but Christian was too far away to hear him.</p><p>\u201cZoe, I\u2019m coming,\u201d he shouted, not giving a damn who recognized him. \u201cStay right there.\u201d</p><p>The couple rounded a corner and he panicked, then his panic turned to unmitigated rage. When he caught up with them, he didn\u2019t think. He grabbed the guy\u2019s fingers from around Zoe\u2019s shoulder and shoved him away from her. Christian didn\u2019t stop until he had him pressed against the wall.</p><p>\u201cChristian, no. Don\u2019t hurt him,\u201d she implored, but he ignored her, pressing his forearm against the dark-haired man\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cHe kept you from me,\u201d Christian snarled, black and red dots of rage filling his vision.</p><p>\u201cGet the hell off of me, Romanov,\u201d his prisoner bit out, but he ignored him, shoving his knee below the guy\u2019s groin and pushing up.</p><p>Christian looked around to make sure they were alone. He wanted to break every bone in the man\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cMr. Matthews was protecting me.\u201d Zoe\u2019s soft drawl pierced the haze of fury.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d Jordan Matthews was among the top security for celebrities. Hell, he heard he was the top of the pile. Christian mentally counted to twenty before he released Matthews. He took a step back and ran shaky hands through his hair then grabbed Zoe\u2019s elbow, walking away with her.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She stopped, nearly making him stumble. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you apologize to Mr. Matthews?</p><p>Christian glanced back at Mr. Matthews.</p><p>Jordan flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Christian said through clenched teeth. \u201cHe should have stopped when you asked.\u201d Actually, Matthews had done exactly the right thing, but he was in no mood to acknowledge that fact. Later when things and heads cooled, he would send him an apology in the form of the bloke\u2019s favorite vice.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome place where men won\u2019t manhandle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that include you?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, he pulled her into an unlocked supply closet and secured the door.</p><p>\u201cChristian?\u201d Zoe shook as he backed her up against the tall shelves, but not because she thought he would hurt her. The reality of what had happened sank in. This would most likely become the most talked about book signing ever. Flashes of tables overturning, chairs flying, people shouting. A man falling on top of her, his weight crushing. Hands grabbing at her, ripping her dress and pulling at her hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, love.\u201d</p><p>Before she knew what was happening, he caged her within his arms and his mouth was on hers. The kiss was savage, his tongue stabbing inside her mouth. She gave him the control he seemed to crave, kissing him back with the same amount of urgency.</p><p>She wound her arms around his neck. Passion and profound relief intermingled as they kissed. Christian had tried to save her from a rowdy crowd. From Jordan Matthews.</p><p>All too soon, his lips found the side of her face. He gently pulled the remaining pins out of her hair and ran his fingers through it. \u201cAre you okay? I didn\u2019t scare you, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, no... Maybe. But not as much as what happened during my book signing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. All I could think of was getting to you and Matthews was in my way,\u201d he said, massaging her scalp. \u201cI\u2019d stop the world from spinning if gravity was causing you pain. There is nothing I wouldn\u2019t do. Not a damn thing.\u201d</p><p>She moaned as fingers worked their magic. \u201cWhere did you learn to use your body like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I do really well when I train for a role that calls for street fighting or hand to hand combat. I rarely require a stunt double.\u201d He leaned back and stared down at her, his expression intense. \u201cGrowing up, I was a bit of a brawler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all she could manage to say.</p><p>\u201cToday has been, without a doubt, the scariest one of my life.\u201d</p><p>Her heart beat loudly in her ears at his admission. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He tilted her chin up. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious. I thought my feelings for you were\u2014 are obvious.\u201d Flushed cheeks made his eyes seem a brighter blue. \u201cI care about you. This makes sense. We make sense. You know more about me than any other person on this planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d His admission touched her heart. Her soul. However, the sensible part of her, the part of her that she still kept to herself and knew what Christian was capable of doing expected the worst.</p><p>He nipped at her bottom lip, then his tongue rubbed against it to soothe the sting. \u201cSay you feel the same way, but if you don\u2019t...\u201d His fingers lightly caressed the side of her face. \u201cI\u2019ll change your mind somehow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned into him, his touch so calming yet seductive that her heart couldn\u2019t keep pace with her emotions. \u201cI do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. No ifs.\u201d Christian\u2019s hand fell to his side, clenching and unclenching. \u201cTell me what to do...what to say to assure you I\u2019m serious.\u201d He leaned against the metal shelves, the tips of his fingers pressing against his bottom lip as he studied her. She became hyper-aware of the rip in her dress, the throb at her temple and that her hair was completely undone.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she breathed in the familiar heartbreaking scent of him, then opened her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>His lips pressed together. For a moment he looked as if he wanted to argue. \u201cI want you to stay in your room for the rest of the afternoon. I need to make sure this wasn\u2019t planned, that it was only drunken idiots with an excess of testosterone. I\u2019ve had threats in the past from stalkers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost recently from those who want to blackmail me,\u201d he added with a resigned look on his face.</p><p>The pictures. She hated that he was in this position. He had so much to give, and already gave so much, without anyone knowing.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stay in my room until you find out who was behind it.\u201d She tucked a large chunk of hair behind her ear. It fell forward, covering one eye. \u201cI need to call my family, anyway. I\u2019d rather they hear about what happened from me than the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them know that I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep you safe.\u201d His arms came around her, gently squeezing her. All she wanted him to do was hold her like this and never let go.</p> <p>Arriving at her room, he turned to face her. \u201cDon\u2019t unlock it for anyone but me.\u201d Taking her key to the room, he swiped the card and opened the door. He held up his hand, indicating for her to wait. \u201cYou\u2019ve eaten lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I have snacks.\u201d Chocolate sounded good right about now. Lots and lots of chocolate.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He entered first, checking the closet and bathroom before returning to the bedroom. \u201cI\u2019m sending security to stand at your door. Men on my payroll. Ones I trust and you can, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cB-but I don\u2019t need security now.\u201d Or maybe she did. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your phone make it through?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Frowning, she pulled her phone out of her skirt pocket and examined it. \u201cStill works.\u201d</p><p>Plucking it out of her hand, he began typing. \u201cHere\u2019s my number.\u201d He slipped the phone into the pocket of her skirt. \u201cText me if you need anything or if you just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your sneaky way of getting my number?\u201d she asked, trying to lighten his mood.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019ll be back soon, yes?\u201d He kissed her again, hard and quick. \u201cHow about dinner at a restaurant without a reputation?\u201d</p><p>She nodded in agreement, despite the need for him to stay. Only she didn\u2019t know how to ask, without coming across as needy. Why couldn\u2019t she woman-up and tell him exactly what she wanted?</p><p>\u201cWhat am I thinking?\u201d He scrubbed his hand across his face, then turned to lock the door behind them. \u201cI can\u2019t leave you like this: alone and waiting on me. I\u2019ll make my phone calls from here, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>Smiling as he faced her again, she said, \u201cStaying is exactly what you do to begin convincing me.\u201d</p><p>Christian posed for another picture and signed a napkin. He craned his neck, looking for Zoe. She sat on a nearby bench, playing with her phone. Mostly likely she was trying to beat his score at \u2018Angry Birds\u2019.</p> <p>After making the decision to not leave her alone, he\u2019d spent rest of the afternoon with her lying in his arms as she drifted in and out of sleep. Inquiries had been made about the fight and The Oasis employee while he\u2019d held her. The fight had turned out to be spontaneous. Unfortunately, Mr. Fulner didn\u2019t exist and all signs pointed to his father hiring the man to make Christian look bad.</p><p>He had become so furious at the news that he\u2019d left Zoe (and a note) asleep in bed and a security guard at her door to go workout in the gym. Thank God she\u2019d understood.</p><p>\u201cWould you sign here?\u201d A woman with a pouty red mouth pointed to her breasts.</p><p>\u201cUh.\u201d He glanced at Zoe again. Her eyes met his, a grin playing on her lips. \u201cHow about here instead?\u201d He wrote his name on the woman\u2019s arm and nodded to security.</p><p>Quickly and efficiently, they cleared the area as he ambled over to Zoe, propping one foot on the bench and leaning over her. \u201cReady for the show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t the main attraction already here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny, but I mean the one I told you about\u2014the flash mob.\u201d Grinning, he stepped back and gently pulled her to her feet. She tucked her phone in her purse and smoothed her dress down.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t flash mobs supposed to be planned spontaneity?\u201d She regarded him skeptically.</p><p>He brushed back the dark fall of silky hair gleaming on her shoulder. \u201cInsider information.\u201d Brennen had told him the dancers would be performing a mash-up of some old Bruno Mars and Train songs. Brennen had also assured him the lyrics would be considered romantic by a woman like Zoe. To ensure his friend was telling the truth, Christian had promised Brennen severe bodily harm if the words \u2018smack that\u2019 left anyone\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cDid your informer say what kind of songs they\u2019d be performing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething romantic.\u201d</p><p>Raising her brows, she smiled. \u201cPulling out all the stops for my last night in Vegas, huh? I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want it to be something you\u2019ve never experienced. Hell, it\u2019ll be new for me.\u201d</p><p>Music sounded to the right of them. Men and women emerged from the crowd, joining in.</p><p>Zoe swayed lightly to the beat while she stood in front of him, then froze. His jaw dropped.</p><p>Brennen had kept his promise. \u2018Smack that\u2019 didn\u2019t leave anyone\u2019s mouth. It was worse. Much, much worse.</p><p>When the last notes faded away, she turned to face him. \u201cDid you mean it or was that for everyone else?\u201d Her dark eyes were luminous and vulnerable.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do this, not to her. No matter how much his agent would love this kind of news about him. Not even for an organization like B.T.S. It was too cruel, too permanent. He had enough sins weighing him down.</p><p>But his heart had other ideas. There would never be another moment like this, so perfect and right. He would never have another woman look at him like Zoe was right now. Like he\u2019d hung the moon and stars for her. She didn\u2019t see him as Ian Romanov, the actor. She knew him, down to his most guarded secrets, as Christian Romanov, the man.</p><p>As if coming from a far off distance he heard himself ask, \u201cWill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, throwing her arms around him.</p><p>Then he kissed her.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Young Elvis winked and shot a finger pistol at them as Christian carried her out of main room of the chapel.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you very much,\u201d Zoe shouted in her best Elvis voice. Her head swam from the all the glasses of champagne she\u2019d drank while they were waiting for their turn. Who knew so many people came to the Little White Church or was it the den of iniquity? Too bad she didn\u2019t have her notepad with her.</p><p>Christian set her on her feet and she lurched to one side. \u201cHang on there, Mrs. Romanov.\u201d</p><p>Reaching around him to grab another glass, she\u2019d only taken a few sips before he snatched it away. \u201cHey, that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve had enough, love. Can\u2019t have you puking your guts up on our wedding night.\u201d</p><p>Her vision blurred, then his fallen angel face came into focus. \u201cWould you hold my hair back if I did? And then feed me Bo\u2019 Jangles the next morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a cure for a hangover?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cAlways worked in college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you a wild-child in college? We never discussed Zoe: The College Years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was very, very good.\u201d She dramatically sighed, thinking of all the times Melanie hadn\u2019t talked her into going out. \u201cAll I did was study, study and study some more. No playtime for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even once?\u201d He smiled at her and she wrapped her arms around his neck to hug him.</p><p>\u201cOnce I was very, very naughty.\u201d She held a finger to her lips. \"Don\u2019t tell my momma, but I did it again tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think all mothers would love their daughters getting married.\u201d</p><p>Zoe snorted. \u201cYou haven\u2019t met my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you think. My mother tends to be dramatic.\u201d She swept her arm out, smacking a vase of flowers and sending the entire thing crashing to the floor. \u201cOops! I\u2019m sorry. So sorry, Young Elvis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdd it to our bill,\u201d Christian said.</p><p>\u201cThanks for not minding my non-sportsiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a real word.\u201d</p><p>She tried to give him an imposing frown. \u201cIt\u2019s my wedding night, and I can say what I like.\u201d She let go of him and leaned against the wall. \u201cAnd I likey that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you I can afford your un-non, er, sporty stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon-sportsiness,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd I can afford myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I like taking care of you.\u201d Christian looked down at his bride as her eyes closed, faint smudges of mascara under them.</p><p>She\u2019d cried when they kissed as man and wife. Then she\u2019d gotten really happy, kissing the preacher and the Elvis impersonator. Hell, he had to stop her before she\u2019d kissed the groom waiting to go next. Not that the guy minded, but Christian sure as hell had. The guy\u2019s fianc\u00e9e hadn\u2019t looking too excited about the prospect either. Even Zoe had noticed and had thrown her bouquet at the woman, telling her to turn her frown upside down.</p><p>Frowning, she mumbled something about her hair. He glanced at her head. The makeshift crown of pink and green flowers she\u2019d put in her hair while they had waited had wilted, but she looked rather enchanting. Her little pink dress made her look bride like. The marriage certificate made it official.</p><p>Come tomorrow he would either kill Brennen or thank him. Maybe do both, then go on a long honeymoon in a country that didn\u2019t extradite criminals.</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pockets to find his phone, texting Sasha with a few instructions. He needed a ring for his bride, and not just any ring either.</p><p>They\u2019d almost skipped over the ring portion of the ceremony, until he remembered the one in his pocket. He suspected Sasha had slipped the thing in his pocket. He also suspected Sasha was in cahoots with Brennen. But why?</p><p>She fussed at the platinum circle when it hit the floor for the hundredth time. \u201cOh, you slippery little sucker. You better stay in place this time.\u201d</p><p>He stifled a grin.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your copy of the pictures and video of your wedding,\u201d the manager of the chapel said, handing Christian a flash drive decorated with faux diamonds.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Christian said. Zoe would be enormously pleased when she had a chance to view them. She had oohed and ahhed over all the Wall of Matrimonial Bliss. Such a little romantic he\u2019d married.</p><p>His little romantic fell on her butt.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s the champagne,\u201d she said, her words slurring. \u201cChampagne. CHAM-pagne. Does that word sound funny to you? Cham-PAGNE.\u201d The ring fell in her lap. \u201cDarn it, my wedding ring slipped again. It\u2019s too big for me. Like you.\u201d</p><p>At least she was a happy drunk unlike his mother who\u2019d wept and railed at the world over what a bastard his father was until the day she\u2019d left. Although, he was inclined to agree with her assessment of Vladimir.</p><p>He brushed away the melancholy thoughts.</p><p>After texting Sasha, again, when he didn\u2019t reply, he sat beside Zoe, but she had other ideas and parked herself in his lap. He groaned as her cute bum ground into his groin.</p><p>\u201cYou okay? Want me to kiss your owie?\u201d</p><p>His what? \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d She plunged her hands between his legs.</p><p>\u201cCarefu\u2014ow,\u201d he yelped as her fingers pinched him on the thigh. Now the word made complete sense.</p><p>She grabbed his hand, holding it up to the light. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry I stabbed you.\u201d Her lips were gentle as they moved over the faint scar. \u201cPoor baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Zoe.\u201dActually, he quite liked the fuss she made over him.</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you call me love. No one calls me love, but you. No one loves me, but you.\u201d Her hand crept around his neck. \u201cAnd I love you, too. Only you, my husband and I lahve him. You.\u201d</p><p>She tried kissing him, missed and nearly high-fived the wall with her face. He managed to stop her just in time by grabbing her shoulders. He pressed a kiss to the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to start singing again? The couple in front of us did enjoy your rendition of \u201cSomebody to Love\u201d and you had the entire chapel joining in on the chorus.\u201d Christian smiled fondly at the recent memory.</p><p>\u201cWise men say, only fools rush in,\u201d she sang in her off-key, but sweet voice. She leaned back in his arms and gazed up at him. \u201cI forgot the rest. Sing it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not and that\u2019s not the right song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit of singing, please.\u201d She batted her lashes at him, and he caved faster than sandcastle hit by a wave.</p><p>\u201cSomebody to love,\u201d he sang softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d She curled against him. \u201cYou remembered our song.\u201d</p><p>He held her close, stroking her back until he thought she\u2019d fallen asleep. It ate at him that he couldn\u2019t remember meeting her, much less their first kiss. And God help him if he was right about it being more than a kiss. A mixture of shame and remorse tried to invade his soul, but he held the emotions at bay. Surely, if it was that important, that involved, she would tell him.</p><p>After all she\u2019d told him about the man that had broken her heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready for my honeymoon, Mr. Romanov.\u201d</p> <p>So was he, but making love to an inebriated woman was high on his list of things he never did anymore. \u201cYou\u2019re drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm not,\u201d she argued, kissing his neck.</p><p>He shivered. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Christian insisted, but his body had other ideas and his arse stayed firmly planted beside her.</p> <p>What the hell was he doing anyway? It had all started with a good night kiss and had quickly turned into her pulling him to the bed. And of course he\u2019d followed her down. And of course it had made complete sense to kiss her again.</p><p>Her toes caressed his ankles while her hands explored the inside of his shirt, rubbing her palms against his chest. And he was acting like a damn schoolboy, running his fingers through her long, silky hair and tickling the side of her face with one of the flowers he plucked from the crown she\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cYes, we can. All you have to do is insert part C into part Z,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He made another pass with the petals of the rose he was holding, highlighting her eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an instruction manual in your carry-on?\u201d he murmured, pressing his lips against hers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s written in the language of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI speak that particular language fluently.\u201d Oh, good God. Someone make it stop. She\u2019d kill him when she remembered the ridiculous lines he\u2019d just used on her.</p> <p>\u201cBe my tutor.\u201d Her tongue slid in his mouth to coax and tease until his followed. When she sucked on it, his dick throbbed in response.</p><p>Holy hell, he had to stop while he could. \u201cZoe, you\u2019re drunk and I don\u2019t want you to regret this.\u201d He pulled away, resting his head on the pillow beside her. He closed his eyes as her hands ran up and down his back.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Not one bit,\u201d she said, her words feathery light in his ear. She scooted closer, her curvy body molding to his once more.</p><p>He untangled his body from hers and sat up, shoving his legs over the side of the bed and gripping the covers so he wouldn\u2019t touch her again. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to because, God help me I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! I have to tell you something,\u201d she said, tugging at his shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s really important. My name\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute, love.\u201d He jumped up from the bed and strode into the bathroom, splashing cold water on his face. \u201cNo touching the wife. Keep your damn hands to yourself. She\u2019s drunk.\u201d Grimacing, he swiped a hand towel over his face. \u201cNow all you have to do is go in there, tell her good night and sleep in one of the other five bedrooms in this place. Alone. Again.\u201d</p><p>Just how many times could they come so close, but never finish? Only for tonight. One more night and then he\u2019d make love to her until he couldn\u2019t or keeled over.</p><p>He blew out a long breath, confident he could resist her. He walked back to the bedroom to find his bride sound asleep, with one hand under her cheek and her lips slightly parted.</p> <p>Gazing at the ceiling, he mouthed a \u2018thank you\u2019.</p><p>After covering her up and pressing a chaste kiss to her forehead, he tilted his head from side to side and joints popped, relieving some tension. He ached to join her. And why shouldn\u2019t he? He could wake her up in the morning with kisses and\u2014</p><p>She sighed, rolling to her back and making her dress dip dangerously low. Her breasts rose with every breath. Instantly, he was rock hard and throbbing for relief. With a restraint he wasn\u2019t aware he possessed, he back away.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he whispered and left the room.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Zoe\u2019s eyes popped open. She sat up, looking around the unfamiliar bedroom.</p><p>The unfamiliar weight on her ring finger caught her attention as the previous night\u2019s events came rushing back. Flash Mob. Little White Chapel. Skinny Elvis. Kissing Christian in bed. Not only that, she had pleaded and begged him to have sex with her. He\u2019d refused not once, not twice but three times.</p><p>Groaning, she fell back on the pillow and stretched an arm over her eyes.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, wife. Already regretting last night?\u201d</p><p>She jerked up, watching as Christian pressed a button on his way to her. The curtains moved into hidden chambers in the wall. \u201cOf course not.\u201d She blinked and squinted at the sunlight streaming through the floor to ceiling windows.</p><p>The mattress dipped slightly under his weight as he sat down. He looked completely sexy and ready for the day while she had morning breath and bedhead. A sneaky glance at the mirror directly across from the bed made her want to yank the sheet over her head, and not come out again until he left.</p><p>\u201cFeel like eating?\u201d His blue eyes were sympathetic.</p><p>Her stomach growled. \u201cMaybe some dry toast and a glass of orange juice.\u201d That usually calmed her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said, rising from the bed.</p><p>As soon as he left the room, she raced to the bathroom. \u201cOh, God, oh, God, oh, God,\u201d she chanted. After seeing to her most pressing need first, she washed her hands, rinsed her mouth out with some mouthwash and scrubbed at her face. There wasn\u2019t much she could do for her hair, but she managed to make the side sticking up lay back down.</p><p>Well, at least she didn\u2019t look like she could scare him into an annulment. He was probably used to waking up with women whose hair was gently tousled and their makeup sleep proof. Not smeared to look like a before picture.</p><p>She made it back to bed and slid under the covers before Christian returned.</p><p>He coughed, then sat down beside her. \u201cWe need to talk about last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d she moaned. Insert part C into part Z. Could she have sounded more ridiculous? Oh, wait she could and had. It\u2019s written in the language of love.</p><p>\u201cBut you were so hot. So wild and uninhibited. No matter how many times I told you we couldn\u2019t do it on the balcony, you insisted. And as your husband, it\u2019s my duty to make you happy.\u201d He stroked the side of her face. \u201cMy little wildcat.\u201d</p><p>She tried swallowing, but her mouth felt like gauze had been stuffed into it. Not only had they had sex, but she had been an exhibitionist. To make matters worse, she didn\u2019t remember anything. \u201cI...uh, that is...\u201d</p><p>Christian looked hurt and his hand fell away. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t good for you? Did I fail to live up to your expectations?\u201d</p><p>Horrified, she shook her head. There was no way she was going to admit she didn\u2019t remember their time together. \u201cOh, no, you were... awesome.\u201d Awesome? She was a best-selling novelist and that\u2019s the best adjective she could come up with? She racked her brain. \u201cIt was like nothing I\u2019d ever experienced before. Almost like I wasn\u2019t myself.\u201d It had to be, because blanks kept coming up when she tried to rewind her memories. She had the absurd notion to scream her fool head off in frustration.</p><p>A grin tugged at his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean almost like it didn\u2019t happen?\u201d</p><p>She gasped, then grabbed the pillow beside her and began smacking him with it. \u201cYou mean, teasing thing.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and blocked her blows. In one swift move, he had her wrists pinned to the bed.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Zoe.\u201d He licked at a small spot on her neck. Heat spread through her body in languorous waves. \u201cTonight, I\u2019m going to make love to you until you\u2019ve forgotten your name. Until you only exist for my pleasure and me for yours. I\u2019m going to be so deep inside of you that we fuse from the heat of our bodies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock. Are you two indecent?\u201d came a male voice, with a British accent.</p><p>Christian looked at her with such longing that it took her breath away. Releasing her wrists, he turned to face their intruder. \u201cHave I ever told you, Sasha, that your timing leaves much to be desired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, beautiful. Here\u2019s the toast and orange juice you ordered.\u201d Sasha gestured to the tray now resting on the nightstand. He sat down beside Zoe. \u201cGave the butler the day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, thank you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShall I feed it to you, dear?\u201d asked Sasha with a wink.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s eyes grew as round as DVDs before she looked at Christian with \u2018help me\u2019 practically written all over her face.</p><p>Christian pulled her over to his lap and reached for the tray, balancing it with one hand and settling it in her lap. \u201cMy wife can feed herself.\u201d He grabbed the toast out of her hand and held it up to her mouth. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She took a small bite. As she chewed, he could almost see the gears turning in her head.</p><p>Sasha\u2019s knowing eyes roved over Zoe, and it was all Christian could do not to punch him. Good God. He was jealous. Pure and simple. He was now one of those guys, with the potential to punch another bloke out first and ask questions later.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s such a spoilsport,\u201d Sasha said. \u201cNever lets me do a damn thing. Are you into m\u00e9nage, darling?\u201d</p><p>The toast fell to the tray. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>Christian felt her body tense. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Sasha, this is my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever stopped you before.\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cYou two\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with me, of course. He did that with\u2014\u201dChristian punched him in the arm. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander, you are not helping,\u201d Christian ground out.</p><p>\u201cI thought his name was Sasha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when I like him.\u201d</p><p>Sasha raised a brow. \u201cI thought we were getting to know one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called too much information, Alexander.\u201d She set the tray to the side, then grabbed the glass of juice.</p><p>Sasha cupped his hands behind his head and shifted his hips from side to side. \u201cThis bed is actually quite comfortable. A lot of spring to help with\u2014What now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d Christian pointed at the bedroom door.</p><p>Sasha crossed one ankle over the other. \u201cThink I\u2019ll stay here, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower,\u201d she announced, slipping from Christian\u2019s lap and running to the bathroom. Her drink went with her.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if you need help washing your back, dear,\u201d Sasha called out, his phone in his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo compliment you on your exquisite taste in wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you approve,\u201d Christian replied. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s wife in the singular sense and you keep your bloody compliments to yourself.\u201d</p><p>An evil grin lit Sasha\u2019s face. \u201cSurely you can\u2019t be thinking to keep her all to yourself?\u201d</p><p>Christian glared at him, until he heard the shower running and the television blaring. Apparently, she had turned it to one of the five thousand music channels because in the next heartbeat, Zoe was singing along to some hideous pop song.</p><p>\u201cStill want her?\u201d Christian asked as Sasha\u2019s expression became one of pain.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me she doesn\u2019t do that when you shag her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess than twenty-four hours of being leg-shackled and you\u2019re already boring.\u201d Sasha tucked his phone back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d Christian asked, ignoring the smirk on his cousin\u2019s face as they walked out of the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI was otherwise occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean you were shagging some woman blind, then got pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say tomato and I say...We say it the exact same way. Anyway, after satisfying the very lovely Kianna and getting a text from you, I left her sleeping in bed while I performed my duties for you.\u201d He gestured to the living room, where several packages were piled on the coffee table. \u201cAs you can see, you interrupted my night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a virtual martyr you\u2019ve become. Shall I look for marks of self-flagellation?\u201d</p><p>A woman walked by, disappearing into his bedroom with what he assumed were Zoe\u2019s belongings. Her purple laptop was plugged in and humming on a nearby desk. An enormous vase of sunflowers sat on the corner beside it.</p><p>His cousin sauntered over to a nearby table and gathered a packet. \u201cI\u2019ve got a whole list of details on your new wife, but I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s rather boring. No love child. Used to be a waitress. No drug history. Lives near her parents. Volunteers at the food bank, church and the local library.\u201d He pulled a face. \u201cUgh, make it bloody boring. However, the bit about some legendary local springs and only true love finding them sound interesting. Marginally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later by actually paying me,\u201d he added, waving the papers at Christian.</p><p>Christian grunted as he eyed him, taking note of the designer pants, slim-fitting button down and Italian handcrafted shoes. Sasha wasn\u2019t hurting for anything. \u201cWhere in God\u2019s name did you get all this information so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine, if you will, a search engine that allows you to type in the object of your knowledge quest and presto,\u201d Sasha snapped his fingers, \u201cIt\u2019s laid down at your proverbial feet. Anyway, Zoe Martha Ambrose of Holland Springs, North Carolina, has four brothers and one sister who posts YouTube videos of herself singing. One of them you might know. His name is Dr. Luke Ambrose and he has a reality show on HBO.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI already know about her family. Well, the highlights.\u201d Christian had heard rumblings of the supposed good looking doctor. \u201cBut isn\u2019t he Latin or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and his twin brother, Logan, were adopted by the Ambroses. Found them as children on a mission trip to South America. Can\u2019t remember the country right off hand. Maybe Chile.\u201d Sasha shrugged. \u201cYou know the whole time I was doing this the theme from Mission: Impossible kept playing in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least something was there to keep your lone brain cell company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m not sexually frustrated. I thought the curse of the wedding ring didn\u2019t happen until at least a year into to it,\u201d Sasha said.</p><p>Murder was illegal, Christian thought. Was it still considered murder if it was a crime of passion? Because right now, he felt like choking Sasha\u2014passionately.</p><p>Christian grabbed an orange from the fruit basket and peeled it, popping a slice in his mouth. \u201cDid you bring what I wanted?\u201d</p><p>Two women entered the room, their uniforms identifying them as staff as they began to clean. The younger one kept giving them side glances and bending over at the waist to show off her Kim Kardashian asset. It was wasted on him, but not apparently on Sasha.</p><p>\u201cCatch.\u201d Sasha winked at the woman and threw a box from the table into Christian\u2019s waiting hand. He set down the fruit and opened the package. Nestled inside was his grandmother\u2019s wedding ring. It looked small enough to fit Zoe\u2019s finger. Actually, it looked like it was made for her.</p> <p>\u201cSebastian is going to kill you when he finds out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Christian grinned big and shoved it in his pocket. \u201cThat\u2019s why I had you get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted that ring for his fianc\u00e9,\u201d Sasha revealed.</p><p>\u201cMy brother\u2019s engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sasha hopped on the table and grabbed an apple, polishing it on his shirt before he took a bite. \u201cHe\u2019s planning ahead. You know his saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Prior planning prevents piss-poor performance\u2019,\u201d they said in unison.</p> <p>\u201cSebastian needs to try being in his twenties,\u201d Christian said. \u201cThen again, I might be the one forced to run for a position with the EU.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut just look at you now, old man. You\u2019re going all respectable. Guess I\u2019ll be forced to go at it alone from now on.\u201d Sasha took another bite of the apple before setting it down beside him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll survive, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruer words have never been spoken.\u201d A fierce light entered Sasha\u2019s eyes, but as quickly as it came it left. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t for good press was it?\u201d</p><p>Christian shrugged his shoulders in answer and dipped his head slightly. \u201cThere\u2019s something about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be?\u201d</p><p>The answer was clear, and he embraced it fully. \u201cThere are some things a man shares with his wife before he announces it to the world.\u201d</p><p>Sasha half jumped off the table and thrust the stapled print-out to Christian. \u201cBe as vague as you want, mate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. Terribly brilliant of you to do this.\u201d Christian read the first page. \u201cYou have her measurements, height and weight on here. And blood type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoogle wasn\u2019t my only resource.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to know the Romanov name is actually being used for good. So that\u2019s what Bo\u2019Jangles is. Hmm, they don\u2019t have any around here.\u201d He raised a brow and glanced at Sasha. \u201cImagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to have something flown in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s leaving tomorrow morning and I plan on joining her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Sasha said.</p><p>Christian jerked his head up. \u201cI can and I will.\u201d Wherever Zoe went, he would follow. Eagerly.</p><p>Sasha pulled out his blackberry. \u201cYou\u2019re to be in Burma by the twentieth. Filming starts the day after. It\u2019s already been delayed once, Christian. Another push back and it\u2019s killed.\u201d</p><p>Christian cursed, knowing that Sasha was right and that he couldn\u2019t do this to Khandiri. He\u2019d made promises and invested in the Burma project. To not show up would be unthinkable, not to mention a personal insult.</p><p>But what would Zoe think and more importantly how would she feel? He wanted to punch a wall. He closed his eyes and mentally got himself together before striding to his bedroom. At the bedroom door, he turned and frisbeed the papers at Sasha. \u201cPut this where I can find it later, and give her one about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I at least throw a party?\u201d Sasha called out.</p><p>\u201cHave at it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Christian strode inside just as Zoe walked out of the bathroom. She was wearing one of his robes and her hair was freshly washed. They met in the middle of the room, staring at one another until her cheeks flushed.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI can\u2019t go home with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her brow wrinkled, then smoothed. \u201cYou want me to come home with you instead, like before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay... I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t, love. I have a prior commitment to make a documentary. It\u2019s in a country that\u2019s not very hospitable to foreign women, especially American ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s okay for you?\u201d Concern shone in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Taking her hand in his, he rubbed the makeshift wedding band on her finger. \u201cAnyway, to show you how much I\u2019d rather be with you and that I\u2019m coming home after two weeks,\u201d He dug into his pocket and pulled out a small box, \u201cI want you to have this.\u201d</p><p>Flicking it open with his thumb, he waited for her reaction, but there was none. Not one gasp or sigh or \u2018Good Lord\u2019 from her. Nothing.</p><p>An uncomfortable silence stretched between them.</p><p>Finally she said, \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to ask her what was wrong. Instead he let go of her hand long enough to free the ring. \u201cTake off that one.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, this is the ring we got married with. I don\u2019t need a fancier one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this will fit better and it\u2019s a family heirloom\u2014my grandmother\u2019s, actually,\u201d he said, thinking the reason for the silence must have been because she didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings by being excited. Zoe had such a soft heart, and he intended for her to stay that way. There was no way in hell he was exposing her to the Hollywood lifestyle. Or his family. The ocean between them wasn\u2019t far enough away from his wife.</p><p>\u201cSlide it on and the other will stay put,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cYou are one stubborn woman, but I appreciate you not wanting to hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><p>The rings flashed in the filtered sunlight and a memory bubbled to the surface, catching him off guard with its inconveniently timed clarity.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you\u2019ll actually show up?\u201d Amber teased between good-bye kisses.</p><p>He slid the one of the two platinum rings he always wore off and onto her finger. \u201cI\u2019ll want this back tomorrow.\u201d He glanced down. The ring seemed to glow. \u201cYour hand looks lovely adorned like this. Or rather the ring is a lovely adornment for the hand. It\u2019ll be the only way I\u2019ll know it\u2019s you without the mask.\u201d</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>He had to get this ring off of Zoe\u2019s finger. He wanted nothing of Amber tainting what he had with Zoe. He reached for her hand, but she forestalled him with a hug and leaned back in his embrace.</p><p>\u201cMen\u2014stroke your egos and y\u2019all fall at our feet,\u201d she said, winking at him.</p><p>He lowered his mouth to hers. \u201cAt the very least I should get a thank you kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I should get a wedding night.\u201d She nibbled on his bottom lip.</p><p>Desire flared and he cupped her face to bring her closer. The memories of Amber fell away and so did all thoughts of confiscating his ring. \u201cWe keep getting interrupted, but tonight I don\u2019t care if God Himself comes knocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor thing.\u201d Her eyes darkened. She fisted the material of his shirt and pulled him closer. \u201cWhy should we wait for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant woman.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, a knock sounded on their door.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Sasha, what the hell do you want now?\u201d he growled as she let go of him.</p><p>\u201cBaxter is here with his entourage to take pictures of the deliriously happy newlyweds.\u201d Sasha opened the door. \u201cMartha sent him. Said to remind the two of you that it\u2019s in your contract. And for Zoe not to wear anything that plays music. Whatever that means.\u201d</p><p>Christian looked at Zoe. She mouthed the word denied, then covered her mouth with her hand while her shoulders shook. Laugh at him would she? He\u2019d teach her a lesson. \u201cSend them in.\u201d</p><p>Sasha\u2019s forehead scrunched. \u201cIn here?\u201d</p><p>Christian unbuttoned his shirt. \u201cOver there, to be more precise.\u201d He waved his hand in the general direction of the bed.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d She shook her head, wet strands of hair flying. \u201cI\u2019m not doing a nude photo shoot with you in bed. My parents could see it!\u201d</p><p>Christian gave her an angelic smile. \u201cThat\u2019s a fantastic idea. I\u2019ll be sure to tell Baxter what you, I mean, we have in mind. Remember, it\u2019s in our contract.\u201d</p><p>If looks could kill, Christian would be six feet under as of twenty minutes ago. Zoe was still murdering him with her eyes as a team of make-up artists and hair stylists got them ready. She sat in a chair, a white sheet wrapped around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for the lovebirds to get into their nest,\u201d Baxter called out, completely into the exclusive bed shots of the semi-nude couple he would soon have stored on his memory stick.</p><p>Christian saw Zoe roll her eyes and he wanted to join her, but he decided to annoy her instead. \u201cYou heard him, sweet cheeks. Get into our cozy nest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you pay for this,\u201d she hissed, but he saw a twinkle in her eyes. She wasn\u2019t entirely upset at the notion. She yanked the covers back and slid in, keeping the white fabric draped around her.</p><p>Christian stripped. Most of the world had seen him bare-assed at one time or another. He joined her, but she scooted as far away from him as possible without actually leaving the bed.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, don\u2019t be shy. Take off the sheet and hug your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still have coffee and cigarette breath. The two smells that make me want to vomit the most,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>Two could play at this game. Christian tugged the sheet away as she made a hasty grab for the comforter, revealing glimpses of her lush body. \u201cThe baby making you sick, love?\u201d</p><p>Zoe\u2019s mouth opened and closed like a fish. Her eyes slid over to the photographer and his entourage. \u201cI am not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>They nodded at her, then whispered to each other.</p><p>Christian took advantage of the distraction they provided as she once again tried to protest. He pulled her close and threw his leg over her thighs, effectively trapping her against him as he nuzzled her forehead. \u201cStop denying it, or they\u2019ll think you\u2019re bullshitting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut honey, you know what the doctor said about your impotence.\u201d She smirked. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Her smile evaporated as he kissed the side of her mouth. \u201cSweetheart, the video we made last night says otherwise. Shall I get my cell out to remind you?\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s not you in it, but since the woman\u2019s face is never shown, I can claim otherwise.\u201d Actually, he was bluffing and all other women had been permanently erased from his memory and hard drives since meeting Zoe. Except for one. His memories of Amber needed to be exorcised from his soul.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you have that on your phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do and maybe I don\u2019t.\u201d He prayed she\u2019d backed down.</p><p>Her face turned pink and she buried it in his chest. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>As it turned out, the afternoon of pictures resulted in pure torture for him. Every time they were repositioned, her breasts or bum would press against him and his body would respond in kind. He was going to have permanent blue balls from all the erections he\u2019d had in the past week. His only consolation was that she wasn\u2019t immune to him. Her nipples were hard, her panties were damp and her breaths were coming out in little pants.</p><p>He slid his hand down her back. She let out a little sigh, melting into him. If only the cameras weren\u2019t here. He would peel away the flimsy barrier of clothes and wrap her legs around his waist. She would make those little sounds in the back of her throat that he loved to hear while she rocked against him, soaking him with her arousal.</p><p>Sweat broke out on his forehead as he grew rock hard. Concentrating on the top of Zoe\u2019s head, he willed his erection away.</p><p>Baxter snapped picture after picture. \u201cMuch better. You two aren\u2019t fighting each other anymore. Zoe, put your left hand on his jaw. Ian put your right hand on the back of her neck, cupping it softly and titling her face up to yours.\u201d</p><p>She made the first move. He cupped her elegant neck, dark hair falling in silky waves and tickling his skin. Her eyes met his, pale jades, olives and forest greens infusing the irises. Plump lips barely parted as she pressed closer to him. Pearled nipples scraped his chest.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take five while I get a new memory stick,\u201d Baxter announced.</p><p>\u201cChristian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, love,\u201d he said as her lashes swept down. His heart swelled. In a million years, he never thought he\u2019d find someone like Zoe.</p><p>\u201cPlease pull up the sheet. Baxter\u2019s assistants keep tugging it down to my waist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo one can actually see anything, and the pictures will photoshopped to show the \u2018real us\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She turned so that her next breath highlighted his ear. \u201cPlease, I\u2019ve never been nude in front of anyone. I mean, my doctor, my momma, Melanie and Eva have seen me, but that doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cWhat about the guy who broke your heart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>How did she not exactly get nude to have sex\u2014wait, there were tons of ways to do that. \u201cWhat about your ex?\u201d</p><p>Silky hair tickled his nose. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her ex had never seen her sans clothing? \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel wanted to wait until after we were married, and I agreed with him.\u201d</p> <p>He waited for her to elaborate, then decided it wasn\u2019t really any of his business. She hadn\u2019t asked him to name all the women he\u2019d slept with, and he was being a dick for doing it to her. But asking for a specific period of time wasn\u2019t the same. At least that\u2019s what he told himself before asking, \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t laugh?\u201d</p><p>Laughing was nowhere near any of the reactions he was having at the moment. \u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver four years,\u201d came her answer, flooring him. Staring at the top of her head, he tried processing what she said. Tried to wrap his mind around someone consciously making the decision to abstain for so long.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a really long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cWill you cover me up now?\u201d</p> <p>Feeling like an ass for making her play twenty questions, he pulled the sheet up to her shoulders. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured before kissing him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the shot we\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d Baxter crowed, the camera once again digitally freezing every move. \u201cThis will have them talking for weeks. Months. Every major magazine and Internet site will have this splashed all over their front pages.\u201d</p><p>They broke apart and she met his eyes once more, in their depths a sweet vulnerability. Zoe was his wife.</p><p>His to cherish and protect, not sell out.</p><p>\u201cBring Mrs. Romanov\u2019s robe and then get the hell out.\u201d</p><p>Baxter stared at him, sputtering, \u201cBut, but that last shot.\u201d</p><p>Christian merely raised a brow. \u201cI\u2019ll triple what you\u2019ve been promised, but the price includes everything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIncluding this?\u201d Baxter waved the memory stick.</p><p>\u201cEspecially that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Zoe took a deep breath, then smiled at her laptop\u2019s camera. \u201cLast night I got married to Ian Romanov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTMZ was right?\u201d Luke asked, his cup dropping to the floor.</p><p>Heath plopped down in the nearest chair, his long legs sprawled out in front of him. \u201cWhat\u2019s his favorite color? I\u2019ll knit matching hats for the two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d Melanie smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>The screen froze on her best friend\u2019s face and Zoe smacked it in frustration. \u201cStupid connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house is not a trashcan. Pick it up,\u201d she heard Carter, the eldest of the Ambrose siblings, say as their video call resumed.</p><p>Luke muttered \u2018sorry\u2019 and did as he was told, but then Logan, the pusher of buttons, got involved. \u201cZoe. Got. Married,\u201d Logan repeated with a smirk, then looked at the group. \u201cThink I should say it in Spanish? It is his first language.\u201d</p><p>Melanie snorted and Zoe laughed.</p><p>\u201cI heard what she said, chilito.\u201d</p><p>Logan grabbed his crotch. \u201cI got your little bitch, right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re admitting we\u2019re not identical everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Carter shot to his feet. \u201cDo you mind? There are ladies present. Not to mention your niece is taking a nap just inside the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho invited Eva? She\u2019ll tell the whole county.\u201d Heath picked up the bag of chips and tilted it up, frowning when nothing came out.</p><p>Evangeline, the youngest of the Ambrose siblings, tossed her hair. \u201cPlease, my nickname isn\u2019t Mouth of the South. That honor would belong to you, brother o\u2019 mine.\u201d</p><p>The two started arguing and pretty soon the entire room was off subject.</p><p>\u201cDo something, Carter,\u201d Zoe ordered her brother.</p><p>Carter whistled and every head turned to look at him. \u201cCould everyone shut up long enough to concentrate on the problem at hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it a problem Zoe\u2019s married?\u201d Melanie asked.</p><p>Zoe wrinkled her nose. \u201cYeah, how is that a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming they\u2019ll stay that way,\u201d Luke pointed out.</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks, Luke,\u201d Zoe snapped.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s romantic,\u201d Evangeline sighed and Zoe beamed at her. She could always count on her baby sister\u2019s support.</p><p>Heath rolled his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re female. That\u2019s all women think about\u2014marriage and babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what Isabella Edwards has been thinking about?\u201d her baby sister shot back.</p><p>Zoe tried to get a better look at her youngest brother. He was still after Isabella? She hoped no one told Gabriel. He\u2019d hunt Heath down, drive out to the ocean and drown him for trying tomes with his sister.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about me and her?\u201d Heath\u2019s voice rose. Yep, he was a dead man.</p><p>Evangeline wiggled her brows. \u201cOh, I know things about people you wouldn\u2019t believe. Things that would blow your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat possessed you to do something so stupid? So out of character?\u201d Luke stopped in the middle of the room and crossed his arms over his chest. He stared at her computer screen image, then glared at Melanie. \u201cOr should I say who encouraged you to lose your damn mind out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I just told her to shake things up a little and be wild out in Vegas. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d get married. I thought she\u2019d just find a man to get it... on... with.\u201d Melanie\u2019s words slowed as every male but Carter looked at her like she was insane.</p><p>Zoe groaned and smacked a hand to her forehead. \u201cStop talking, Melanie!\u201d</p><p>Evangeline started laughing.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Eva, it\u2019s not funny. The thought of that womanizing asshole touching her makes me want to perform surgery on him without anesthesia. Romanov doesn\u2019t respect women. He just uses them.\u201d Luke\u2019s hands clenched into fists. He looked like he was itching for a fight. \u201cI know all about his reputation. He\u2019s legend.\u201d</p><p>Evangeline smiled brightly. \u201cI think Zoe likes the thought of him touching her. In fact I know she would.\u201d</p><p>Heath groaned and leaned forward in his chair. \u201cI hate repeating myself, but how do you know?\u201d</p><p>A cold chill went down Zoe\u2019s spine and her palms became damp. What exactly did Eva know?</p><p>\u201cYou people are so thick.\u201dAt their blank looks, she sighed and pulled out her e-reader. \u201cMaybe this will help your feeble male minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvangeline Mae, put that up,\u201d Zoe ordered, wishing she could teleport through the wireless connection and smash it to pieces. \u201cI should\u2019ve never given you the stupid thing.\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned on each face as it was passed around, until Luke got it. His pissed-as-hell-look grew darker. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this is the same guy she met out in California at that party of Aunt M\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Evangeline snatched the e-reader back from Luke and handed it to her sister-in-law.</p><p>Zoe grabbed her laptop and yelled at it. \u201cHello, I\u2019m still here! Ask me, not her.\u201d</p><p>Melanie ran her finger across the small screen, turning pages. \u201cThere could be lots of tall Russian guys with blond hair, blue eyes and...oh, yeah...in chapter fourteen, we find out Dimitri has a tattoo of a sunflower. Doesn\u2019t Ian have a tattoo of a rose\u2014seriously?\u201d Her brown eyes flew to Zoe\u2019s, hurt filling them. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you kept it from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t keep it from anyone,\u201d she mumbled, ducking her head to avoid Melanie\u2019s stare. It was the only thing Zoe\u2019d ever kept from her best friend.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s the bad guy,\u201d Heath pointed out, shooting Zoe a funny look when she glanced back at the monitor. \u201cBad guys are, well, bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, Heath. Anymore words of wisdom you care to share with the group?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cDimitri isn\u2019t completely bad,\u201d Zoe said, her cheeks heating. \u201cHe\u2019s misunderstood. And I\u2019ll have you know that I use celebrity pictures all the time as inspirations. Joshua\u2019s doppelganger is Henry Cavill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy from The Tudors?\u201d Evangeline sent Zoe a disbelieving look. \u201cYeah, right. Anyway, the pictures of them from that night helps, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went through my things?\u201d All thoughts of gratitude for her sister\u2019s support fled. To think that she\u2019d help Eva sneak out to see Reece by distracting their mother with a spur of the moment shopping spree. Zoe hated shopping with their mother. Or rather what their mother tried to get her to buy.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to my world,\u201d Heath grumbled, his mouth full of chips. It wasn\u2019t surprising that he was on his next bag. He was always hungry, always eating. Then again, playing for a minor baseball league while trying to get the attention of scouts from the majors was grueling on the body. Heath was obsessed with playing and working out. He was also obsessed with knitting. Something that amused the rest of the Ambroses to no end.</p><p>\u201cWhat pictures?\u201d Carter asked.</p><p>\u201cThe ones hidden in a shoe box at the top of her closet.\u201d Evangeline toyed with a button on her cardigan.</p><p>Everyone\u2019s head swiveled to Zoe.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the one labeled private?\u201d Zoe narrowed her eyes at her little sister.</p><p>Evangeline flushed. \u201cI might have accidentally knocked the box down and they might have accidentally fallen out. And I might have accidentally looked at them...and tried on the ring with them.\u201d</p><p>Zoe glanced behind her, checking the door. All she needed was for Christian to overhear this family conversation, before she had a chance to talk with him.</p><p>Melanie\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThere\u2019s a ring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone get to have any privacy around here?\u201d Heath asked.</p><p>\u201cYou lost all rights to privacy when your marriage ceremony went viral on YouTube,\u201d Carter pointed out.</p><p>Zoe slid her gaze to the webpage she\u2019d minimized. The video had gotten over three million hits. \u201cWe\u2019re nowhere near \u2018cute kitten rescued by hot fireman\u2019 levels.\u201d</p><p>Carter crossed his arms. \u201cWhat a relief.\u201d Sarcasm dripped from his words.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone given any thought to the location situation?\u201d Logan asked, snatching an unopened bag of chips from Heath after he\u2019d returned from the pantry.</p><p>Everyone, including Zoe, stared at him in confusion.</p><p>\u201cWell, Romanov lives\u2014and I\u2019m taking a big leap here\u2014in LA, while Zoe lives, well, not in California. As in they have homes on the opposite sides of the country. Hell, isn\u2019t he British? Where will they live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says he\u2019s going to live that long to find out?\u201d Luke countered.</p><p>Zoe narrowed her eyes at her bloodthirsty brother. \u201cReally, Luke? Your solution is violence? Way to be all doctory.\u201d</p><p>Luke crossed his arms, unfazed by her insult. \u201cYou got married because blondie over there told you to be wild with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say Ian specifically. I just said a hot guy or five to have a good time with,\u201d Melanie snapped.</p><p>Good Lord. Zoe grabbed a pillow and hugged it. \u201cThat\u2019s not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you didn\u2019t steer her in the famous direction just so you could help your business out, Melanie?\u201d Luke sneered. \u201cI\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t dream of asking to take exclusive photos of the newlyweds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s out of line.\u201d Melanie had never tried to use anyone for anything. Luke was being unreasonable, even more than usual. How he\u2019d ever accomplished having a great bedside manner as an intern was beyond Zoe\u2019s comprehension.</p><p>\u201cNow, wait a damn minute, Luke,\u201d Carter said, jumping to his wife\u2019s defense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not waiting a damn anything. Prepare yourself when Zoe comes home alone and heartbroken.\u201d</p><p>Zoe\u2019s blood boiled. Just because she did something that they didn\u2019t expect or, God forbid, approve first didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t have her happily ever after. \u201cWay to trust my judgment, Luke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour judgment?\u201d Angry dark eyes met hers through the computer screen. \u201cYou assured me the rumors being blogged about you and Romanov were nothing. Just a mutual agreement to be seen together. And now we know you lied your ass off.\u201d Luke tossed a scowl at Melanie. \u201cShe learn that from you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really over-reaching, Luke. If you don\u2019t stop, I\u2019m going to reach over and beat your ass,\u201d Carter growled.</p><p>Luke shook his head and held up a hand. \u201cAll I\u2019m being is a realist. Something the rest of you should be doing, too.\u201d</p><p>He marched off screen. Zoe heard a door slam.</p><p>Carter cleared his throat. \u201cOur main goal is to make sure that momma does not find out about this until you call her. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>She told her siblings good-bye, her stomach sinking with each response. Luke didn\u2019t bother coming back inside. She closed her laptop and put her head in her hands. What had she been thinking?</p><p>Leah Ambrose was going to have a full blown fit with a capital HISSY. Zoe had taken away another chance at planning the dream wedding Leah never had, and God knew somebody was going to pay. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Christian paced the balcony, wishing for a cigarette. The sun beat down on his head and a trickle of sweat made its way down his back, but it wasn\u2019t because he was hot.</p><p>For once he was nervous, unsure of what to do next. The screen of his phone showed a missed call from his brother. Sebastian never called him. Never texted him. He only spoke to him when necessary.</p><p>Maybe he should try to mend thing with his brother. Start things fresh. He pressed call on his phone\u2019s screen. They could go slowly so Sebastian would know he was serious. That he was\u2014</p> <p>\u201cDid you use the remaining brain cell living in that empty head of yours to get the chit to sign a pre-nup?\u201d Vladimir asked.</p><p>Just what he needed. Crafty old fool knew he wouldn\u2019t answer his call or return it. \u201cWhy would I do that?\u201d he purposely slurred the words.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever sober, Christian?\u201d Vladimir sounded pissed. Excellent.</p><p>\u201cDefine \u2018ever\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in if you ever pull a stunt like this again, I\u2019ll cut off your trust fund.\u201d</p> <p>Then Christian would be a multimillionaire instead of a billionaire. Oh, the horrors. \u201cWell, if I were to agree to your demands, then certain avenues would have to be traveled which would lead to a certain destination that would require me, i.e you, to pay out more than just my trust fun. Savvy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t find this remotely funny. Why can\u2019t you grow the hell up and act like a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me consult my magic eight ball and I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d Christian gripped the balcony\u2019s railing with one hand, his knuckles whitening.</p><p>\u201cIs she pregnant? Is that why you had to marry the woman?\u201d</p><p>He had to have sex with the woman first, but decided not to enlighten his father of that little fact. \u201cYou do realize this is the twenty-first century? And there are ways to prevent that.\u201d Ways that he\u2018d employed every time.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but at the rate we\u2019re going....\u201d He let his words trial away before he continued, \u201cWhat shall the brat call you: Vlad? Grandpa? Hey You?\u201d</p><p>His father let loose a string of profanities, mostly in Russian, that impressed Christian\u2019s jaded ears.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize one could do that with sheep or fish guts.\u201d He could hear his father\u2019s teeth grind over the phone, the sound making Christian smile.</p><p>\u201cMake the little money-grubber sign a damn agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Zoe,\u201d Christian snarled, all the posturing of the without-a-care-drunk fled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the documents emailed to you in less than two hours. Lucky for you, the State of Nevada considers postnuptial agreements valid.\u201d His father ended their call before he could.</p><p>God, he hated when the old man got the last word.</p><p>He heard a sniff and turned to find Zoe looking at him with tears in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d he asked, wary of her answer. He didn\u2019t want her to think he wasn\u2019t serious about her or them.</p><p>\u201cWas that your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d</p><p>To his surprise she wrapped her arms around him.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cMad Vlad is what Sebastian and I used to call him behind his back.\u201d He heard her laugh, but it sounded hallow. He leaned back to get a good look at her. \u201cAre those happy or sad tears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Zoe replied, not saying anything more. She couldn\u2019t tell him that half her family thought she was stupid. That they were disappointed in her for marrying someone like him. It didn\u2019t matter that Melanie and Evangeline supported her. Or that Heath said he\u2019d knit Christian a hat to match hers. Her own mother was threatening to disown her, right after she called an emergency prayer circle. There was no way she would hurt her husband\u2019s feelings by sharing their opinions of him. He received enough rejection from his own family.</p><p>She allowed him to guide her to a nearby chair and pull her into his lap.</p><p>\u201cI put Baxter\u2019s memory sticks in the safe. You can take them home with you tomorrow,\u201d he said, his expression serious.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>They laced their fingers together, his conspicuously missing a ring.</p><p>\u201cI have to buy you a wedding band.\u201d In her love stupor last night, she\u2019d failed to think of anything beyond \u2018I\u2019m getting married to my dream lover\u2019. She hadn\u2019t meant to get drunk while they were waiting, but she had been so nervous. So sure Ashton Kutcher would show up with a new Punk\u2019d crew to tell her it was all just a joke. The champagne had helped steady her nerves.</p><p>\u201cSomehow the thought of making love to a married woman seems very scandalous for me,\u201d he teased, making her swat at his arm. He raked a hand through his blonde hair. It gleamed in the setting sun, pale golds, dark ambers and wheat strands. \u201cActually, it\u2019s because it\u2019s you and you\u2019re my wife.\u201d He gave her a side glance. \u201cI think that\u2019s how I\u2019ll refer to you from now. Wife or Mrs. Romanov.\u201d</p><p>Her heart sped up, until it was beating against her chest like hummingbird wings. She loved the titles. \u201cWhile I\u2019ll call you Mr. Zoe Ambrose or Zoe Ambrose\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a bone melting smile. \u201cAh, yes, I suspect you\u2019re more famous than I in literary circles. Tell me, love, will your brainy friends welcome me into their fold? Or will they sip serious drinks, give me serious frowns and try to school me on how movie adaptations are bastardizing novels.\u201d</p><p>Christian was insanely funny, completely sweet and... entirely unlike his persona. Heck, he was entirely unlike the asshat he\u2019d been at the airport last week. Had it really been only a week? It seemed as if a lifetime had passed, but now everything was in fast forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat has caused that most serious frown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you better now,\u201d she blurted, inadequately prepared at explaining what she meant. \u201cNow who\u2019s seriously frowning? But what I mean is that you are totally a different person than almost a week ago and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s an act, if you\u2019ve made the right decision, if you\u2019re willing to go against what your family thinks of our rather hasty decision.\u201d He gave her a knowing look. \u201cShall I go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a better job at explaining me than I am.\u201d The antique diamond ring sparkled and flashed in sun.</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God,\u201d came Sasha\u2019s voice through the open door and then the he graced them with his awesomeness. Or at least that\u2019s what he said as he walked out on the balcony. His moss-colored eyes assessed them both, but settled on her. And narrowed.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wearing that to my party?\u201d</p><p>His party? She looked down at the ankle length skirt and peasant top she was wearing. It had not been a part of her gift from her aunt. It had been a part of her retail therapy purchase.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with it?\u201d</p><p>Sasha grabbed the hem and shook it. Tinkling bells sounded.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard something.\u201d Christian\u2019s eyes were riveted on the bells, too. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would.\u201d Sasha turned to her. \u201cDo your clothes normally give out your location?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d More like a lot. But the face Sasha sported made her keep that little tidbit to herself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in for it now.\u201d</p><p>Sasha grabbed her hand, pulling her after him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. Christian trailed behind them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t change too much, eh? I like her as is.\u201d Christian headed to the elevators.</p><p>She gaped at him. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have another meeting with Peak,\u201d Christian stopped at the doors, his brows creasing together. \u201cMaybe I should cancel and stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Laurie. I\u2019ll keep Meg as pure as Bella Swan on her wedding night.\u201d Sasha guided her to the second master bedroom.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you just referred to Little Women and Twilight in the same sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSacrilege, I know.\u201d He stopped suddenly, then stepped to the side, revealing racks of clothes, shoes and displays of jewelry. A man and two women smiled at her.</p><p>Wide-eyed, she looked up at him. \u201cIs this for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your husband says.\u201d Sasha walked around her, his hands behind his back. \u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re a size eight, yes?\u201d</p><p>More like a ten, but hey, who was she to argue?</p><p>He wrinkled his nose as if smelling something foul. \u201cA shame we can\u2019t stretch you out. It\u2019s all in the way the dress lays, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d she snapped, tired of his insults. No amount of potential fun make-over was worth this humiliation. She walked away, heading for the door. She\u2019d find her own clothes to wear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, please come back, Amber...rose\u201d he said, but to her it was as if he had shouted the words.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d She pivoted to face him.</p><p>An angelic smile graced his mouth. \u201cAmbrose\u2014it is your last name. Going for the sports team angle.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, she walked back to him. \u201cOkay, but you have to be nice or I\u2019ll wear something worse than this to your party,\u201d she threatened, shaking her skirt. The bells tinkled.</p><p>Grimacing, he shook his head. \u201cThere can\u2019t be anything worse than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but there is. Imagine tie-dye plaid tangerine and purple with striped leggings and a matching hat,\u201d she improvised, trying to think of hideous, even to her, wardrobe combinations. \u201cBirkenstocks and a feathery boa complete said ensemble.\u201d</p><p>He looked like he was going to be physically ill. \u201cPeace; I cry peace. For the love of God, woman, stop!\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Sasha\u2019s assistants. They were busy talking amongst themselves, unfazed by Sasha\u2019s outburst. Heck, they were probably used to his theatrics.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you married a man with lots of cash to make you look good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not after his money. I have my own. And my own house and car. And things. A yard. Trees.\u201d She racked her brain for more of her assets. \u201cWaterfront property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd blue birds singing a happy working song as you pick flowers from your carefully tended garden. Yes, dear, I\u2019m well aware of your assets.\u201d His eyes traveled down her body. \u201cAnd how Christian would like to merge his with yours. Why couldn\u2019t he have picked someone a little less gauche is beyond me.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. \u201cTwo feather boas in lime green and sparkly eye shadow. And I\u2019ll get Brennen to streak my hair with bright yellow dye.\u201d</p><p>A grin broke out on his face and he laughed. It was warm and completely without artifice. \u201cI like you, Zoe.\u201d He turned to the racks of clothing, pulling out dresses and holding them out and up to her.</p><p>\u201cPurple looks best on me,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cI suspect there aren\u2019t many colors that don\u2019t look good on you.\u201d His compliment eased the butterflies multiplying in her stomach.</p><p>A hot pink and feathery dress was held out to her, but she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNot enough feathers?\u201d he teased with a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cToo young.\u201d</p><p>He put it back, then handed her another. \u201cHow\u2019s this one? Vintage Vivienne Westwood.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cGo try it on, dear. We can tailor it to fit you.\u201d</p><p>While she was having her hair and make-up done, Sasha entertained her with stories of growing up with Christian and his brother. \u201cSpeak of the devil,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cYour husband just texted me. Why don\u2019t you pick out a pair of heels while I run a quick errand, yes?\u201d</p><p>She toyed with a sparkling necklace while she waited.</p><p>Sasha returned with a packet of papers. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at the first sheet, she almost dropped it after reading the first few lines. \u201cA background check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it was only fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was nice of him,\u201d she said, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>\u201cHe has the same information on you, dear.\u201d</p><p>Of course Christian would. He was an actor and one of the heirs to an Oil and Mineral Conglomerate worth billions. Both of which would draw the crazies. So why wouldn\u2019t he have background checks on everyone? But for him to give her one back...The paper crumpled as she made a fist. \u201cI\u2019ll read the rest, after your party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Zoe.\u201d He rested his hands lightly on her shoulders for moment. \u201cThe dog days are over for you. No more hiding in corners or behind potted plants unless you take Christian with you. He\u2019s also extremely fond of sneaking away at parties, but I think you already know that.\u201d He left the room, whistling a tune that got stuck in her head.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019ve had enough socializing for tonight,\u201d Christian murmured in her ear, his hand splayed across her lower back.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t left her side once. No matter who smiled at him with a come-hither look, he\u2019d ignored them all and focused his charm on her. Exclusively.</p><p>Heat seeped through her. \u201cReady when you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute to speak with Sasha, then we\u2019ll go.\u201d Christian visibly tensed. \u201cWho the hell invited her?\u201d</p><p>The crowd parted, and a woman emerged from the depths.</p><p>\u201cJaylen probably invited herself,\u201d Zoe muttered.</p><p>Jaylen Stone, a gorgeous blonde, was a former lover of Christian and held the distinction of dating him for almost two years. Rumors had flown, fast and furious, that the two were headed down the aisle. When Jaylen had moved in with Christian, Zoe had immersed herself in her house and career. Ignoring everything, but renovating and writing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jaylen greeted them with a cool smile. \u201cHow absolutely charming you two are. And don\u2019t you look pretty, Zoe. The years have definitely agreed with you. You must be... what\u2014the big three-five?\u201d</p><p>Even as Christian swiveled his head back and forth between the two, Zoe kept her composure and refused to take the bait.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jaylen. You look nice tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Jaylen\u2019s icy grey eyes narrowed. \u201cStill working on getting rid of the accent I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWe were acquaintances while she lived in California. You know how Martha loves for all of us to be one big happy family. And now you really are. Well done, Zoe. I didn\u2019t think you had it in you.\u201d Jaylen touched Zoe\u2019s arm, making her skin crawl.</p><p>\u201cYou used to live in L.A.?\u201d He scraped a hand through his hair as she nodded. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t gotten to that part of her background check. \u201cWith whom?\u201d</p><p>Jaylen let out a throaty laugh. \u201cThis is too rich. Can\u2019t you see the family resemblance? The fine print of Martha Alfred\u2019s contracts is getting more ridiculous by the year.\u201d</p> <p>He pierced her with a sharp gaze. Zoe placed a hand on his arm, muscles tightening beneath her palm. \u201cI meant to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you ran back home I never got the chance to ask how it felt to not be woman enough to keep him,\u201d Jaylen said, making the guests closest to them shuffle closer.</p><p>Zoe stared at the woman, tongue frozen. Jaylen had been her confidant while living in Los Angeles. She\u2019d also been the ultimate frenemy, but Zoe hadn\u2019t known it at the time. In fact she\u2019d poured her heart out to Jaylen about Christian.</p><p>\u201cEither leave willingly or I\u2019ll have security escort you out,\u201d Christian said in a deceptively soft voice, sending shivers down Zoe\u2019s spine. She hoped to God he never spoke to her in that tone.</p><p>Jaylen smirked. The woman would have been even more beautiful if her soul wasn\u2019t so disgusting. \u201cSo good to see you, Zoe. Christian, don't be a stranger.\u201d She glided away.</p><p>You tell me how it feels! Of course she\u2019d think of the right thing to say now that Jaylen was gone.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d He pulled her into an empty workout room, flipping on the lights. \u201cIs what Jaylen said true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartha Alfred is my mother\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartha\u2019s your aunt?\u201d His jaw worked. \u201cZoe Martha Ambrose, makes sense now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you didn\u2019t get that far in your Welcome to Zoe\u2019s World packet.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look remotely amused by her attempt at humor. \u201cDid she put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing seen with you or this?\u201d She held up her left hand, wiggling her fingers.</p><p>\u201cEither.\u201d</p><p>What did he have to be so mad about? \u201cJust to be seen with you at dinner and that\u2019s it. Didn\u2019t you ask me to hang out with you because I wasn\u2019t your usual type?\u201d she reminded him. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t set up an elaborate marriage proposal in the middle of the strip either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have me there,\u201d Christian admitted. He\u2019d chased her all over Vegas, time and time again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt your feelings, but I have to know where and when we met for the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time I met you was on New Year\u2019s Eve. Right before you really made it big with the Austen remake. We kissed at midnight.\u201d</p><p>Over four years ago. Four months after moving to LA. Closing his eyes, he tried to bring back the memory of that night. Unfortunately, all he could remember was blur of colors and bodies writhing against one another. He didn\u2019t remember a damn thing about kissing her.</p><p>Shame filling him, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Flimsy but it was all he had at the moment. However, from here on out, he would make it up to her.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I shouldn\u2019t have let my pride get in the way of honesty and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop beating yourself up over a kiss. The past is the past.\u201d He grabbed her hand, kissing the rings he\u2019d given her. \u201cEverything has worked out as it should have.\u201d He would have been no good for Zoe at that point in his life.</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>Wrapping her in his arms, he nuzzled the top of her head. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She remained silent and he continued to hug her, thinking she needed time to collect herself or her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWas that your one time being naughty bit? Kissed me when you had a boyfriend, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I got caught up in everything.\u201d Her words were muffled by his chest. \u201cI was trying to find a place to hide when you grabbed me again.\u201d</p><p>He tilted her face up and smiled down at her. \u201cWe all do stupid things. Daring things. In your case scandalous things like marry a man with a scandalous reputation.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with exasperation clearly written on her face. \u201cFormerly scandalous, remember?\u201d</p><p>He bent low to nibble on the curve of her ear. \u201cI\u2019m still scandalous, but only with you.\u201d He ran his hands along the curves outlined by her dress. His entire body ached for his wife, but he could be patient. \u201cLet\u2019s join the party, shall we, before I kick everyone out.\u201d</p><p>They re-entered the room and Christian surveyed it. The party goers looked firmly entrenched as they drank and mingled.</p><p>To hell with waiting.</p><p>He craned his head around until he found the man he was looking for and nodded, then swept Zoe up in his arms and headed toward their bedroom. She snuggled against him, wrapping her arms around his neck.</p><p>\u201cThought you were going to strum a sweet tune, mate?\u201d Sasha called out.</p><p>Christian shut the door in his face, then locked it.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to play guitar?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play whatever you\u2019d like. Tomorrow.\u201d He dropped her in the middle of the bed. \u201cEither you take off your clothes while I get rid of mine, or I\u2019m going to rip your dress to shreds.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>A marriage underpinned by lies. That\u2019s what she had with Christian.</p><p>But he\u2019d said the past was the past, she reminded herself. He\u2019d also said she\u2019d never put him in one of her books. If only he knew the truth, if only she could stop being a coward and tell him. Waiting for the perfect moment would never happen. There was no such thing as the perfect moment to reveal a lover\u2019s betrayal.</p><p>Sitting up, she rubbed the heel of her hand over her heart. \u201cThere\u2019s something else I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>He placed his knee on the bed and caressed her cheek with the back of his hand. \u201cCan it wait?\u201d</p><p>She gazed at his body, shirt undone and unbuttoned pants hanging low on his hips. Her fantasy come to life. The fantasy of many women who only wanted to be real with one. \u201cNo.\u201d Her voice cracked over the word.</p><p>\u201cWe did more than kiss?\u201d Despite his question, he sounded less than shocked. Maybe he\u2019d suspected or assumed they\u2019d done more than kiss all along. After all, what woman held a grudge over a kiss?</p><p>Nodding, she made herself look at his face. At the tenderness and desire that made him more handsome than ever. She was such a fraud. \u201cA lot more.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the material of her dress up her legs, exposing the tops of her black stockings. His eyes grew dark. \u201cWere you wearing something like this?\u201d He bent, dropping a kiss on one bare thigh then the other.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Small puffs of hot air scorched her skin. \u201cAt the risk of sounding like a complete arse, I think you should let me make love to you like I did that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight,\u201d she supplied. One lie uncovered, only one more to go.</p><p>Sitting up, he placed his in his lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to make it up to you, beyond apologizing and there aren\u2019t enough apologies in the universe to fix it. Allow me to do this, give me this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWords are overrated.\u201d Giving him a shy smile, she held out her hand. \u201cGive me a man of action.\u201d Tonight could be his and in the morning, she would be a woman of words and actions. Whatever the consequences, she would bear them, because it would be no less than she deserved.</p><p>He pulled them to a standing position, then unzipped the side of her dress. It slithered down her body and to the floor, leaving her wearing nothing spiked heels and stockings with a garter belt. She shivered but not from the cold.</p><p>Gazing at her in obvious male appreciation, he said, \u201cNo damn wonder I had to have you.\u201d He shrugged out of his shirt, his hands going to his pants, pushing them down.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d His gaze flew to hers, hands stilling. She flushed. \u201cYou kept those on and I should have on my dress, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care. It stays on the floor.\u201d Moving closer, he caught her face between his hands and kissed her. \u201cI assume we didn\u2019t have a bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a wall.\u201d Nipping at his lip, she smoothed her hands up his chest. \u201cAnd you said fuck, not make love.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he dusted his thumb over her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed and turned on at the same time.\u201d She trailed her hands down his chest, smiling as he gasped and sucked in his stomach at her touch. \u201cDon\u2019t be in such a hurry, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to know what we did first?\u201d She licked his collarbone, then bit him there. He grunted. She\u2019d take that as a yes. \u201cYou put your mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>He moved to kiss her. \u201cLower.\u201d Grinning, he headed for her breasts. \u201cLower.\u201d</p><p>With that same grin on his face, he fell to his knees and parted her. \u201cThis low enough?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he began to lick and kiss her there, savoring her like he had the chocolate covered fruits. So choreographed in his movements that she didn\u2019t know whether to be insanely jealous or ecstatic.</p><p>The ache between her thighs intensified with each pass of his tongue, her hips moving with him. Her fingers tangled in his hair, pressing him deeper. \u201cOh God,\u201d she moaned. Her legs trembled, knees threatening to disappear even as her body tightened in on itself, until every nerve seemed to be concentrated in one place.</p><p>A finger eased inside of her, then two as he began to pump in and out. Suddenly, he stood and grabbed her waist with his free hand, pulling her to him. Her breasts rubbed against his chest.</p><p>\u201cTaste how sweet you are.\u201d</p><p>The moment his lips touched hers, she lost control. She went wild, biting and sucking his tongue deep inside her mouth while his fingers continued their tender assault. So close...so close. Her heart pounded, blood rushing and breaths coming so quick and fast that she became dizzy.</p><p>\u201cChristian,\u201d she breathed, wanting more. Needing more. She needed him inside of her.</p><p>His hand slid down her waist, under her thigh and wrapped her stocking-clad leg around his hip. He leaned her against the nearest wall. \u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d His fingers left her, foil ripped and then he pushed himself inside her, stretching her to the point of pain and she loved it.</p><p>His arm shot out, banging against the wall. \u201cSo tight...so wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me more.\u201d She tilted her hips, grabbing the material of his pants. \u201cDeeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, not like this.\u201d He hooked her other leg over his arm and thrust hard. She gasped, closing her eyes. \u201cLook at me.\u201d Her eyes flew open at his command. \u201cI won\u2019t forget this.\u201d</p><p>Muscles bunched and flexed beneath her hands as he moved within her, as he rocked inside of her and touched a place so sensitive that she cried out.</p><p>He did it again. This time she screamed his name, her orgasm so long and hard that she saw supernovas. His head fell to her neck, his hips pumping relentlessly against her until he thrust deeper than ever and held himself there.</p><p>They stayed joined like that for what seemed like hours, when in reality it wasn\u2019t long at all. She flinched as he pulled out of her.</p><p>\u201cZoe,\u201d he whispered against her skin, letting her legs slowly down. \u201cForgive me.\u201d</p><p>Unable to hold back the tears, she could only nod.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He scooped her up in his arm and carried her to the shower.</p><p>Christian looked around the room, searching for something that could delay his trip. But all he found was his wife, wrapped in an oversized robe and watching him with her pretty eyes.</p><p>The things he had done to her last night...Hell, the things she\u2019d allowed him to do. He couldn\u2019t get the image of his head of her wearing nothing but a skirt with bells on the hem as she danced for him. Or her bare breasts bouncing as he thrust inside of her, teasing her with shallow movements, until she hooked her legs over his arms and tilted her hips.</p><p>He\u2019d never forget lying in bed with her afterwards, stroking her back as she snuggled against him. Peace. He was finally at peace.</p><p>He smiled, taking in her long dark hair and full lips. Her cheeks were flushed and she looked well-loved. By him. He held his hand out, leading her to the balcony when she took it. \u201cMy plane is ready whenever you are. Harlan, the pilot, is excellent.\u201d</p><p>A smile wobbled on her lips. \u201cCan he fly me to you?\u201d</p><p>He captured her in a hug, bending his head and rubbing the top of hers with his chin. The honeysuckle scent of her silky hair teased him, threatening to bring back the memories of another woman and another goodbye. But it hadn\u2019t been the morning after and it hadn\u2019t been nearly as painful, even when she hadn\u2019t shown up the next day. Hell, it didn\u2019t touch this.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he confessed his soul to her. \u201cI promise to be the man I should be, the man I\u2019m meant to be and the man you deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo movie line. It\u2019s me; it\u2019s you. You are my muse, my inspiration, my reason for everything,\u201d Christian revealed between kisses. \u201cAnd I\u2019m completely in love with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mouth had fallen open slightly when he leaned back to gage her response. He kissed the tip of her nose and smiled down at her. \u201cWell, say something. I know this seems rather sudden, but it feels right.\u201d</p><p>And as if coming from a great distance he heard her say, \u201cAfter we had a one night stand and you broke your promise to me, I put you in my book\u2014as the villain, Dimitri.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p> <p>\u201cYou must be joking.\u201d Christian hadn\u2019t expected her to say words back, but this was the last thing he\u2019d ever expected to come out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, anguish in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>The deep seated insecurity he\u2019d always been able to keep buried clawed to the surface like a vampire escaping its human grave. \u201cI see.\u201d But he didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t comprehend what she\u2019d said, much less what she had done. He had to get out of here, away from her.</p><p>Pushing away from her, he strode to the door. Every step serving to remind him of what he was to her. The bloody villain of her novels. No wonder she wanted him to play Dimitri in the movie. Martha said Zoe had requested him. How ironic to play a character reviled by many and created by the woman he\u2019d fallen deeply in love with.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you walking away from me?\u201d Zoe asked, her feet smacking against the tile. \u201cPlease, Christian, let me explain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExplain what? You\u2019ve said enough. Hell, you\u2019re probably still writing about me, and my time here. Who the hell knows what kind of inspiration you\u2019ve found.\u201d He stopped, turning quickly and narrowly avoided colliding with her. He clenched his hands into fists. \u201cYou are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cYou can read it if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to read it,\u201d he shouted. \u201cI want you to stop writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re willing to give up something you obviously love for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. If you give up your writing, I\u2019ll forgive you.\u201d He clenched his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s only fair for you to be a woman of action.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face confirmed his fears: he wasn\u2019t worth it.</p><p>He rolled his shoulders and tilted his head from side to side, pain coating his insides. \u201cForget I asked. Look, I\u2019ve a plane to catch, a documentary to film about a war torn country and a tremendous amount of friends to reacquaint myself with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after, you\u2019ll come home to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo you, the woman who\u2019s been exacting her revenge for years, without my consent or knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She placed her hand on his arm, but he shook it off. \u201cI was hurt and angry and-and it just happened. No one knows but me.\u201d</p><p>He threw his hands in the air. \u201cHow do I know that\u2019s not a lie?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed and her eyes shifted away. \u201cMy family figured it out, too, but not until after we got married.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFantastic. How long do you think it will take the press to figure it out\u2014another week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re being like this. I forgave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without making me pay for years first.\u201d It dawned on him in that moment that he was the man she\u2019d told him about. He had hated that man, had wanted to hunt him down and slowly cut his testicles from his body. The man he\u2019d offered to hold down so she could stab him through his heart. Funny how she carved up his heart without a single weapon.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to remember me.\u201d Her gaze skittered away. \u201cThe night we slept together, I looked different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent how?\u201d</p><p>She tugged on a thick lock of hair. \u201cThis was red and I wore brown contacts.\u201d His world closed in on him as she continued, \u201cWe both had on masks and I told you my name was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber,\u201d he finished for her. Holy mother of God, she was the woman he\u2019d dreamed about, obsessed over and had waited on for hours to show up the next day.</p><p>Her jaw dropped, eyes round as she met his gaze. \u201cYou remember me?\u201d</p><p>Instead of admitting the obvious, he looked down his nose at her. \u201cI haven\u2019t shagged that many redheads, so the lot of you tend not to blend like the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me why you didn\u2019t keep your promise.\u201d</p><p>He had kept his promise to her. He\u2019d waited and waited, until the waiters pitied him and Jaylen had saved him from embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so distraught, so sincere in her pain that he wanted to tell her the truth of that day. But he didn\u2019t trust her or himself. \u201cBecause I\u2019m Ian Romanov and that\u2019s what I do. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are being so cruel?\u201d She dropped her head into her hands, her words muffled by them. \u201cI thought you\u2019d changed. You said you loved me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin. Her pretty eyes were filled with unshed tears and her mouth trembled. The sight tore at his heart and he leaned in, his lips brushing hers. He wanted to comfort her. God, he was so screwed up in the head when it came to Zoe...Amber. Whatever the hell she called herself.</p><p>Her mouth opened under his, and he took full advantage, deepening the kiss and slipping a hand inside her robe. He fitted it under her bare thigh, lifting it up and around his hip. Her fingertips clutched at his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Christian,\u201d she murmured against his lips. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s try to work this out.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, she was good. A damned good liar. \u201cYou\u2019d let me take you to bed right now, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d Her head shook from side to side, but he pulled her closer, letting her feel how hard she\u2019d made him with one kiss. \u201cTell me the truth, Zoe. I deserve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A victorious smile covered his face as he released her and stepped back. \u201cSorry, I\u2019d rather not have a repeat of last night. In fact I\u2019d rather forget it happened at all.\u201d She flinched as if he had struck her. \u201cHowever, you have my eternal gratefulness for the brilliant PR move. Me, married to a nobody like you. Only in Vegas.\u201d God, he could be a cruel bastard. Something to thank his father for, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exactly the way I\u2019ve written you: a womanizing asshole who cares about no one but himself.\u201d Color returned to her cheeks, her eyes flashing. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a big stretch of the imagination to figure out why the only time you\u2019ve been recognized for your acting is when you\u2019re playing yourself.\u201d She would bring up the one and only time he\u2019d won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor\u2014playing the role of psychopath.</p><p>He turned on his heel, bumping into Sasha on the way out.</p><p>\u201cI wished to God I stabbed you in your heart, Ian Romanov\u2014if you actually had one!\u201d</p><p>The door slammed behind him.</p><p>He spun around, grabbing the doorknob. \u201cI don\u2019t have one?\u201d He tried turning it, but it wouldn\u2019t give. She\u2019d locked it against him. Pounding on the door, he said, \u201cUnlock the door.\u201d</p><p>Sasha grabbed his arm, pulling him away. You\u2019ll do something that even the Romanov name won\u2019t be able to get you out of. More importantly, it would be something you\u2019d live to regret.\u201d</p><p>Christian shook away the rage. This wasn\u2019t him. He\u2019d never hurt a woman in his life and he had no intention of hurting Zoe. At least not physically. He was wounded. Defeated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d he said, jerking away and grabbing his retro aviators on the way out. He stopped and leveled Sasha with a look. \u201cGet my rings back.\u201d</p><p>Instead of a snarky comment or even a glib reply, Sasha looked uneasy. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take some time to cool down?\u201d</p><p>The bedroom door opened.</p><p>His wife marched right up to him, her head held high. \u201cHold out your hand.\u201d</p><p>He refused, crossing his arms over his chest.</p><p>A hardness he\u2019d never seen covered her face. She deposited the rings in the cradle his arms made. \u201cI don\u2019t want you accusing me of stealing your things.\u201d Turning to Sasha, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re my witness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll email you the annulment papers,\u201d Christian said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She spun on her heel, smacking into the table in front of her. Pausing to rub her hip, her profile revealed her wince of pain. However, she didn\u2019t say a word while hobbling away.</p><p>He clenched his teeth together, afraid he\u2019d call out to her. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time she walked out of his life.</p><p>But for damn sure it would be the last.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Tears ran down Zoe\u2019s face as her mother drove her home. She thought she would have been all dried out by now. Then again, Leah Ambrose had been known to make grown men cry.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to hurt your feelings, but no man is worth messing make up\u2014except your daddy. Well, if you had any on. How many times have I told you to always put your face on before you go out?\u201d her mother said, glancing at her.</p><p>\u201cA million,\u201d Zoe sniffed, wiping at her nose with the lace handkerchief her mother had given her. Leah had handed it to her as soon as Zoe had gotten in the car. She didn\u2019t know if her mother was being spiteful or insightful. Most likely a combination of the two.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be sassy. I didn\u2019t run off and marry the first fool to have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run anywhere. I was on a business trip.\u201d Zoe clenched her teeth.</p><p>\u201cMartha had getting married in a heathen ceremony by an Elvis impersonator on your itinerary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElvis was not the preacher,\u201d Zoe reminded her, but it was futile.</p><p>Leah waved a manicured hand in the air. \u201cSugar, I don\u2019t care if Rick Warren married you in Sin City. It was tacky and extremely rude of you.\u201d</p><p>Zoe scrunched her nose. \u201cYou thought getting married to Gabriel at the Aviation Club was high society?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarrison Collins and Noah Sawyer belong to that club.\u201d</p><p>As if a bank president and a developer as members made that place so much better. \u201cIt\u2019s for remote controlled airplanes, momma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not getting above your raisin\u2019,\u201d Leah said, her mouth flattening. She pulled the car into her gravel driveway and stopped.</p><p>Zoe lifted her chin and looked her in the eye, trying to remember that her mother really did love her. \u201cThank you for the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Her mother opened the door. \u201cI\u2019ll help you with your luggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that much,\u201d Zoe began, but Leah had already made her way to the trunk. Resigned to the fact that her mother wasn\u2019t done with her, she got out of the car and headed to the house.</p><p>Leah followed her inside, tsking at the sight of Zoe\u2019s mismatched furniture and piles of everything strewn throughout. \u201cYou really need to straighten up this house. A clean home and a full belly is the way to a man\u2019s heart, you know.\u201d She set two of the suitcases by the door and placed Zoe\u2019s carry-on on the overstuffed chair by the fireplace.</p><p>So is screwing him every day, Melanie whispered in her mind. A cross between a sob and a giggle escaped her mouth.</p><p>Kitten heels clicked across wide pine floors as her mother walked around. She ran a finger across the table and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWill you stop?\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s head snapped up, dark blue eyes narrowing. \u201cThat man teach you to talk to your mother like that? What kind of family does he comes from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow should I know? I\u2019ve never met them.\u201d Yeah, that was helping. Zoe steeled herself for more of her mother\u2019s diatribe.</p><p>\u201cZoe Martha Ambrose, that man has no morals, a bad reputation and couldn\u2019t see fit to come home with you. He\u2019s off gallivanting around and has been photographed with another woman while you\u2019ve been hiding out in Palm Island for the past three weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was writing.\u201d And going through pints of chocolate ice cream while watching Christian\u2019s movies on the iPad he\u2019d given her. Weeping while slingshotting birds at pigs. Later, after seeing pictures of her husband dancing with a woman named after a fruit, she\u2019d chunked the damn thing into the ocean.</p><p>Of course she\u2019d gotten it back out. No need to kill sea life just because the entire world she\u2019d built for herself had been blown apart, rearranged to have Christian at the center before being sucked into a black hole.</p><p>\u201cYou should be signing your name on the dotted line and be done with that man.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s disappointment was more than she could take at the moment. She had no desire for a lecture. No desire for the I-told-you-so speech. Her breaking point had past. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore. I loved him, but I lied to him and now he-he...\u201d</p><p>Leah crossed the room, enveloping her in a hug that lasted for hours. When the tears finally stopped, her mother brushed back her hair and gave her a sympathetic smile. \u201cYou want me to spend the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd make me some hot chocolate?\u201d Zoe asked with a sniff. She stepped back and smoothed her shirt down over her hips.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need,\u201d Leah said, moving to the door.</p><p>Zoe frowned. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Her mother turned to face her, eyes soft in the fading light. \u201cTo get my overnight bag from the car.\u201d She waved her hand in the air. \u201cYou know what they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe prepared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo matter how old you get or the mistakes you make, you\u2019ll always be my baby.\u201d Leah shut the door behind her.</p><p>A ribbon of warmth wound its way inside of Zoe, thawing some of the ice in her heart and soul. She sank to the couch, pulled her knees up to her chest and waited. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt really is for the best, son,\u201d Vladimir\u2019s pale eyes met Christian\u2019s. His father was impeccably dressed in a navy suit, every inch the coldblooded mogul as he sat behind his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you ever care what was best for me?\u201d Christian gripped the bottle of Russian Standard. He never knew when he would need another shot. The chair creaked as he flopped down in it.</p><p>His father\u2019s expression sharpened. \u201cIf you had studied business instead of theater, we wouldn\u2019t be in this mess.\u201d Vladimir pounded a large fist on the top of the desk.</p> <p>\u201cBut where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d Christian asked, knowing full well his father viewed him as an embarrassment. And a soon to be major drain on the family finances if he didn\u2019t get Zoe to sign the post nuptial agreement. Then the bloody annulment papers.</p><p>He\u2019d be free to go back to his old life. Brilliant.</p><p>\u201cNo woman\u2019s worth the fun you have in mind,\u201d his brother, Sebastian, said from behind him.</p><p>Christian didn\u2019t bother to turn around. He knew Sebastian would end up at the desk beside their father. When his prediction came true, Christian let his contempt be known. \u201cWhile no woman thinks your fun is worth anything.\u201d</p><p>Of course their father smiled at Sebastian. And of course as soon as Vladimir looked back at Christian his smile turned into a sneer. \u201cFor the love of God, Christian, quit pouting and sober the hell up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally, Father, why do you waste so much time lecturing the blissfully and knowingly ignorant?\u201d Sebastian murmured.</p><p>\u201cYour fraternal affection is heartwarming,\u201d Christian said, then raised the bottle to his lips for another drink.</p><p>\u201cWhile your familial sense of duty is deplorable.\u201d Sebastian\u2019s eyes, mirror images of Christian\u2019s held no warmth, no humor. Not even a spark of life seemed to exist there.</p><p>Vladimir held up his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. Deal with it... him, Sebastian.\u201d With those caring words, their father walked out and the two brothers were alone.</p><p>Christian took another pull of the bottle and wished for a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cPlan on drinking yourself to an early grave?\u201d Sebastian sounded as if he could have been talking to anyone. \u201cIt would make the divvying out of our inheritance come this August much, much simpler.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo bugger yourself.\u201dChristian hurled the bottle at him, narrowly missing his brother\u2019s shoulder. The bottle smashed into the wall of bookcases, most likely ruining some of his father\u2019s prized books. Excellent.</p><p>Sebastian didn\u2019t move, merely stared at him with icy contempt. He sat on the edge of the desk. \u201cWhy are you here, Christian?\u201d</p><p>Christian stood, throwing his arms wide and spun around. \u201cI come at our father\u2019s bidding. Same as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I offer him economic value while you drain our resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m living my life. On my terms.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian had the nerve to laugh at him. Him. \u201cHow\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d Without waiting for answer, he continued, \u201cYou found the woman of your dreams\u2014twice. Married her, then sent her packing so you could play in Burma. When that wasn\u2019t enough, you decided to start sleeping with Peaches and become a drunk\u2014again.\u201d Sebastian clapped. \u201cWell, done. Bloody brilliant.\u201d</p><p>Christian strode to the desk, knuckling the top and leaning in. \u201cFor the last time, you know her name is Kate, and we\u2019ve never slept together. And I wasn\u2019t playing in Burma. I was helping a man document the horrors going on in that country. The struggle for power, for people getting hurt when they happened to be in the right place at the wrong time.\u201d He purposefully ignored the stab about Zoe. He couldn\u2019t think of her. It hurt more than anything he\u2019d ever felt before. She\u2019d lied to him, betrayed him and laughed at him while writing. He was the model for her villain. No, not model. He was the villain.</p><p>Instead he gave a cocky smile and added, \u201cBut I am drunk and I plan to stay this way for as long as possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a spoiled little boy who didn\u2019t get his way,\u201d Sebastian mocked.</p><p>Christian shoved his brother, knocking him off the desk. \u201cYou\u2019re an arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to see you\u2019ve proven our father right.\u201d Sebastian smoothed his hair and righted his tie.</p><p>Okay, he\u2019d bite. \u201cWhat, that I\u2019m a drunken, no good son of a bitch who will never amount to anything? Didn\u2019t think you disapproved of his opinion. Hell, didn\u2019t know you were allowed to have an original thought.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian pulled out his phone, thumbs moving over the keyboard. \u201cI thought you knew what you wanted and didn\u2019t give a damn about everyone else\u2019s opinion. I thought you were better than what you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo little, too late.\u201d Christian headed for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be at Sasha\u2019s if Vladimir needs to summon me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Sasha\u2019s on your side?\u201d</p><p>Christian threw the door open. \u201cHe\u2019s more of a brother than you\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one who sent your agent the pictures. And that\u2019s not all,\u201d Sebastian called out.</p><p>Christian froze. \u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Christian had never been one for praying, and he wasn\u2019t too sure that if he started now God would actually listen. He did it anyway, crossing himself and murmuring the familiar words even as he hoped his brother had been wrong. Then again, if his brother was right, that meant Zoe hadn\u2019t been lying to him.</p><p>His heart thumped against his chest.</p><p>After punching in the code, Christian let himself in the front door. The three story townhouse was silent, but he knew Sasha was home\u2014Sebastian had said as much. The stairs barely made a noise as he jogged up them to the master suite.</p><p>\u201cWake up,\u201d he growled, striding into Sasha\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Sasha stirred and mumbled something in his sleep.</p><p>\u201cI said, wake up.\u201d Christian moved to the bed. He ripped away the sheets, grabbed a glass of water left on the nightstand and poured onto his cousin\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell!\u201d Sasha bolted up in bed. Water plastered his hair to his head and dripped off his nose. \u201cAre you trying to drown me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for answers about the crimes you\u2019ve committed against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty without a trial\u2014thought you\u2019d embraced American ideals.\u201d Sasha rose and crossed the room, disappearing into the bathroom. His infuriatingly calm manner did nothing for Christian\u2019s blood pressure.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Christian asked when Sasha reappeared.</p><p>Sasha ran a hand through his hair, making it stand up in some places. \u201cI was bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBored?\u201dChristian fought the urge to punch his cousin in the face a couple hundred times. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Sasha shrugged.</p><p>Christian sat in one of the chairs that flanked the fireplace. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving until you give me the truth.\u201d Childish, yes, but he was at a loss at what to do next. He needed answers. Answers that only Sasha could give.</p><p>Sasha sat in the opposite chair, stretching out his legs.</p><p>Around the room dust motes floated in the air. The room was strangely lacking personalization. Sure it was fit for a bloke like his cousin, with an oversized bed covered in designer sheets while priceless art hung on the walls. However, there was nothing of the man who lived here.</p><p>Come to think of it, it was the first time Christian had been in Sasha\u2019s house. For as close as they were, he and Sasha hadn\u2019t really spent any time together in the past few years. Not like mates should. His cousin usually showed up when he needed him, or to direct Christian to the next party.</p><p>\u201cYou and your bloody first world problems,\u201d Sasha said, breaking the silence.</p><p>\u201cMy bloody what?\u201d Raising his brows, Christian sliced his gaze to Sasha. There was a bruise the size of a man\u2019s fist on Sasha\u2019s chest, just above his right nipple ring. \u201cRow?\u201d</p><p>Sasha glanced down, then back up. There was a hardness in his green eyes. A hardness Christian had only seen once before, at Sasha\u2019s father\u2019s funeral. \u201cDoesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does and had you called me, I\u2019d have been there and had your back,\u201d Christian reminded him. Although he wanted answers about Sasha\u2019s meddling, he wanted to know what had gone wrong with his relationship with his cousin. Couldn\u2019t there be one person in this world that he could trust not to lie to him?</p><p>Sasha laughed, but it was brittle. \u201cMy back? Might want to re-think that.\u201d</p><p>Christian started to defend himself, to point out a time where he\u2019d done exactly that, but his memories were empty. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it, and none of that bored bullshit excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say it was in my best interest.\u201d Sasha stood. \u201cThat enough of an excuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it be in your best interest to do it again?\u201d Christian asked, his hands clenching into fists.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me.\u201d Sasha\u2019s face was weary. Lines bracketed his mouth. He was without his usual wit. \u201cGo home, Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have one.\u201d Verbalizing that truth was a punch in the gut. And what hurt worse was the knowledge that with Zoe he would have had one. Would have had anything and everything he\u2019d ever wanted with her. But his damned pride, ego, whatever he wanted to call it made him throw it all away.</p><p>\u201cJoin the club,\u201d Sasha said. \u201cHowever, as president, I won\u2019t approve your membership. We\u2019ve standards to uphold.\u201d</p><p>Christian shot him a wry smile. \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be pissed at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe whatever you want, mate. Not all of us have that luxury.\u201d When had Sasha become so cryptic? \u201cBut I\u2019d recommend sorting things out with your wife first.\u201d</p><p>Like that would be easy.</p><p>Christian had always thought people who broke up over The Big Misunderstanding in movies were ridiculous. Something the screenwriter liked to add for dramatic effect to draw things out. But now he knew exactly why it happened, for him anyway. He\u2019d refused to listen to Zoe\u2019s explanation, refused to be swayed by the deep hurt in her eyes.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter what Sasha\u2019s role was in all this. Christian knew his father was the puppeteer pulling all the strings. But he had to know the truth. \u201cAt least tell me what happened that day.\u201d</p><p>Sasha moved to the fireplace. \u201cLong or short version.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Sasha turned away, facing the mantle. \u201cI had her calls and texts blocked, paid off her hair dresser to take an extraordinarily long amount of time dying her hair back, and encouraged Jaylen to show up when Miss Persistent headed to the restaurant an hour and half late.\u201d</p><p>Dread rose inside of him. \u201cShe was telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoke to you, too.\u201d</p><p>Memories of that day rushed over him, like the tide. The shy fan who\u2019d come up to his table\u2014just as Jaylen kissed his cheek. He\u2019d offered to sign something for her.</p><p>I don\u2019t want anything from you, he remembered her saying. Then the little brunette had practically run out of the diner, smacking into a few chairs along the way.</p><p>\u201cOh dear God.\u201d Running a hand over his face, he let out a groan. \u201cI\u2019ve royally fucked things up.\u201d</p><p>Sasha turned to face him, raising his brows. \u201cWho told you the club\u2019s motto? Now I\u2019ve no choice but to approve your membership lest you blab our secrets.\u201d</p><p>Despite his anger, his shame and frustration, Christian managed to laugh. He stood, clapping a hand on Sasha\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m off to Holland Springs. Care to come with me?\u201d</p><p>The smile that had begun to form on Sasha\u2019s face evaporated. \u201cI\u2019ve other obligations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing to see Phoebe?\u201d Christian asked as he moved to the door.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m allowed,\u201d came his cousin answer. Christian\u2019s father controlled every part of Phoebe\u2019s medical care as well as Sasha\u2019s inheritance.</p><p>Damn Vladimir Romanov to hell. Christian paused in the doorway. \u201cIs there any way I can help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me get ready for tonight?\u201d Sasha shook his head, waving him away. \u201cYou can barely dress yourself.\u201d</p><p>How had he missed this act that Sasha put on? \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way it has to be,\u201d Sasha said quietly, then moved to the bathroom, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Zoe opened her front door, startled but not surprised to see the man standing on the other side. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She tried to be brave, tried not to cry when she saw his familiar face, but his eyes held so much compassion that she broke down when he gave her a single sunflower.</p><p>\u201cPretty flower for a pretty lady,\u201d Gabriel said, his arms strong as they held her. Solid. Real and comfortable.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the flower.\u201d Her words were muffled by his collared shirt. She pulled away, guilt filling her soul. What was she doing hugging him? Gabriel of all people? Even if he was her ex, she was still married. Yeah and the annulment document was still sitting in her in-box, waiting for her electronic signature. \u201cIs there something you need?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, eyes crinkling and dimple showing in his left cheek. A smile that was genuine and the same for everyone. \u201cI\u2019ve come to check on you. See if there was anything you needed.\u201d</p><p>She stepped to the side and gestured for him to come in. After placing the sunflower in a vase, she joined Gabriel on the couch.</p><p>For long minutes, he stared off into space, seemingly preoccupied. Actually he acted as if he\u2019d rather be any place but with her. Which was fine, but strange. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to take you out Friday night. Down to Blue Moon and then Poor Boys to hear your sister sing with her band.\u201d His gaze stayed on the picture above her fireplace while his voice confirmed her early suspicions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m married.\u201d She flashed her hand at him, blushing when she realized nothing was there.</p><p>\u201cAs friends, Zoe. Nothing more.\u201d His indigo eyes gazed at her, in their depths so much pain that she covered her mouth in shock. \u201cFor old time\u2019s sake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d She lay the hand that had covered her mouth on his arm.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He grabbed one her pillows, flipping it around in his hands. \u201cJust thought you might need someone to talk to or a shoulder to lean on.\u201d</p><p>His shirt was damp from where she\u2018d done just that. \u201cGuess I did.\u201d</p><p>Things had always been easy between her and Gabriel. They\u2019d always been more like friends than lovers. More like brother and sister than an engaged couple. While she knew he had his own beliefs about sex and marriage, he was still a man with a man\u2019s needs and wants. Needs and wants that he\u2019d never pressed on her.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t know how much of a stand-up kind of guy he was, she would have suspected he\u2019d been cheating on her. But that wasn\u2019t his style. He was too honest.</p> <p>Azalea Holland had been the one to insist they belonged together. On paper they were perfect, but in real life...boring and there had been times when Gabriel had been downright mean and impatient with her. Totally out of character for him. Like now.</p><p>\u201cDid one of my brothers put you up to this?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and leaned back on her sofa. \u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but I agreed to ask you out as a favor to someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She should have known.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Zoe,\u201d he said, placing the pillow between them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the way I treated you when we were dating.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so sincere that she moved her hand down to his, gripping it. \u201cI know. You said that in the letter you wrote me. You\u2019re a good man.\u201d</p><p>His shoulder sagged, then he placed his hand over hers. \u201cI need some advice. \u201c</p><p>Scooting to the edge of her cushion, she said, \u201cI\u2019m all\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your bloody hands off my wife.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty- Seven</p><p>Zoe fell off the couch, pain exploding in each kneecap as the hardwoods gave them a high five. \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>Christian rushed over before Gabriel could help her, lifting her by the elbows and making her body hum in approval.</p> <p>Stupid body.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t be excited to see him. She should only be mad and hurt. And suspicious. There hadn\u2019t been anything in the news or on the Internet about the pictures. Yet. Not that she cared.</p><p>\u201cGet your bloody hands off of me,\u201d she snapped, but Christian didn\u2019t let go until she was firmly on her feet.</p><p>\u201cShall I get some ice for your knees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with my documentary, wife.\u201d Christian stroked the side of her cheek, his touch soft and gentle. It made her knees weak. It made her wish for a knife. \u201cNow I\u2019m home to stay.\u201d</p><p>Once she would have loved to hear those exact words, but now she wondered if he had more horrible publicity to get rid of, or those stupid pictures had finally gone viral.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your wife.\u201d She scowled at him, then remembered Gabriel sat on the couch. \u201cAnd you\u2019re interrupting my date.\u201d</p><p>Instead of pissing him off or making him leave, Christian extended his hand to Gabriel. His hand. \u201cI\u2019ve heard good things about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Romanov,\u201d Gabriel stood, then shook Christian\u2019s hand. \u201cI better be going.\u201d</p><p>She did not want to be alone with Christian. \u201cI thought you needed my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a beer.\u201d Her husband, yeah she could refer to him in her head like that, ambled over to the kitchen like he owned the place.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Zoe, I think it\u2019s best if I leave,\u201d Gabriel said quietly.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Christian handed Gabriel a beer and Zoe a glass of juice. \u201cYour toast will be just a minute, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit trying to remind me of Vegas,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Christian smiled, then sat in the chair closest to the fireplace. She and Gabriel copied him by resuming their former seats on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cThis was your Grandmother Waverly\u2019s house, right?\u201d Christian asked, surprising her with his knowledge. Just how much did Sasha find out about her? And more importantly why had Christian continued to read it?</p><p>He searched the open floor plan of her house, and much to her dismay she found herself wanting Christian to like it. To love it and want to stay with her. She mentally shook herself. He didn\u2019t want to be here and she sure as heck didn\u2019t want him either.</p><p>\u201cI started renovating it about three years ago, but I\u2019m not quite finished,\u201d she said, plucking at a quilt throw, then smoothed her skirt down. Bells at the hem jingled.</p><p>She took a large gulp of her juice.</p><p>\u201cI like your skirt, love. Puts me in the mind of dancing girls and sultans,\u201d Christian said, his gaze caressing her face.</p><p>She spit out her drink.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Gabriel shot to his feet, brushing at the liquid with his hands.</p><p>Clenching her jaw, she wiped her mouth. Christian would bring up her wearing nothing but that stupid skirt for him while doing her best impersonation of a belly dancer.</p><p>Orange juice dripped off of Gabriel and onto the floor. \u201cCan someone get me a towel so I don\u2019t make your floor sticky?\u201d</p><p>She marched to the kitchen to grab a towel, leaving her half-empty glass on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWas that a movie you starred in?\u201d Gabriel asked as she handed him the towel.</p><p>\u201cThere were cameras involved, but it will never be seen by the public.\u201d Christian winked at her, his smile wicked and making her mouth drop open in shock. He\u2019d recorded them? Ringing her husband\u2019s neck would be too good for him. He should be made to star in a reality television show instead.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyebrows rose as he gave her a sidelong glance. \u201cNow I really have to go.\u201d He tugged at his wet shirt.</p><p>She grabbed his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Gabe. You know you\u2019re always welcome. After all, we were planning on living here. Together.\u201d Turning to Christian, she said, \u201cWe even picked out the furniture in the master bedroom. Together.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s smile evaporated and she wanted to cheer, but Gabriel cut her preemptive celebration short.</p><p>\u201cI need to get this in the wash before it stains. Nice to see you both. Take care of her.\u201d Gabriel moved to the door. He shut it behind him and a few seconds later his truck rumbled to life, the pulled out of the driveway.</p><p>\u201cAlone at last, love.\u201d He crossed the small distance between them. She jumped up, determined to not let him touch her. She would fall apart if he did. Fall apart into pieces so small that they could fit on the head of a pin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d She backed away from him, occasionally glancing over her shoulder to make sure she didn\u2019t do the ultimate Zoe move and trip over something.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsshat!\u201d</p><p>Christian lifted a brow and stopped in his tracks. \u201cNow\u2019s who trying to reminisce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go.\u201d Zoe whirled away, but was stopped from leaving the room by his hand on her arm. Looking up at him when he moved to stand in front of her, she steeled her resolve. Steeled herself against the pure unadulterated pleasure of his touch. She remembered those elegant fingers as they touched, explored and satisfied every need.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he warned. \u201cOr I\u2019ll take you against the nearest wall.\u201d</p><p>Fury flashed through her body as some of his last words to her echoed in her mind. \u201cI\u2019d rather forget we ever happened.\u201d</p><p>He let go of her long enough to rake his hand through his perfectly tousled hair. For some reason it made her even angrier. How dare he show up here? So damn smug and as if he hadn\u2019t been cruel. As if he hadn\u2019t cut her deep with his words and actions.</p><p>She ran the length of his body with her eyes. No, Christian shows up looking like he\u2019s about to be photographed for some men\u2019s fashion magazine. All sexy and dressed to kill her.</p><p>\u201cObviously, I lied about wanting to \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d She tried to put some distance between them, rounding the couch to make her way to the back of her house. An ocean between them was preferable, but the island in her kitchen would have to serve.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant and you know it.\u201d Christian stopped short of joining her side of the barrier she put between them.</p><p>\u201cHow do I know anything?\u201d She pounded her fist against the cold granite countertop. \u201cWe barely know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t classify what we do know as bare. More like carnal. Intimate knowledge between a man and woman,\u201d he drawled, infuriating her even more, but then he did the unexpected. His posture changed and his eyes seemed to glint with... something? \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I made a mistake and I\u2019m here to right it, to be that man I told you about. The one you deserve. Let\u2019s try to work things out.\u201d</p><p>She almost forgave him. Right at that moment she wanted to run to him, wrap her arms around him, stroke his hair and whisper she loved him. That she understood, that she\u2019d been just as much as at fault. It would be entirely easy to give in to him.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can say to make things better.\u201d</p><p>Christian exhaled. He should\u2019ve known it wouldn\u2019t be that easy. That he couldn\u2019t waltz into her house, announce that he was home and she\u2019d come running to him. Seeing Zoe with her ex had put him in full blow this-is-my-woman mode. Jealousy, true jealousy at the intimacy she and Gabriel had shared had made him want to plant his fist in the guy\u2019s face. All over them talking. Talking.</p><p>\u201cLet me stay the night and show you how sorry I can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one night?\u201d She raised her chin. \u201cThen what\u2014you\u2019ll leave in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d There was no way in hell he was going anywhere, but if Zoe calling the shots\u2014or at least thought she was\u2014led to the desired outcome, he\u2019d gladly follow.</p><p>Her green eyes looked black in the softly lit room before she narrowed them. \u201cI want you to get back on the plane you flew in on and never return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for what I wish.\u201d Her lips flattened into a thin line and she marched away, slamming the sliding glass door that led to her back porch behind her.</p><p>Ten minutes. He\u2019d give his wife ten minutes before he went after her.</p><p>He rolled his head to one side, cracking his neck and relieving the pent-up tension. Well, at least some of it.</p><p>Looking around the room, he took note of the coziness. The warmth, the hominess that seemed to seep from the cheery yellow kitchen to the muted green walls of the living room. This was a house that had been lived in, loved and restored by Zoe. Pictures of her family were everywhere. Walls, tables, and bookshelves held their images. He walked over to the mantle of the fireplace. A collection of crystal fairies danced along the length while a framed print of Hale\u2019s The Crimson Rambler held a place of honor above it. Maybe he should buy her the original.</p><p>Nodding to himself, he pulled out his phone and texted Sasha, then wandered around. The chair he\u2019d sat in had been large and comfortable. Made for a man or rather a woman who liked to curl up with her e-reader by the fire. He could practically guarantee the sofa was wide enough and long enough for him to stretch out on. With her.</p><p>And while his taste ran to ultra modern designs with sleek lines and bold color, he found that he loved Zoe\u2019s feminine style. The whimsy she placed in the oddest of places. An old pair of paint-spattered rain boots held emerging daffodils on the front porch while an open-mouthed frog umbrella stand greeted visitors in the small foyer.</p><p>He peeked into what he thought was her bedroom. The bed was all wrong. The style, the size, and the color of the wood used for the headboard. It took up the entire room, overpowering the antique dresser and vanity.</p><p>Moving into the room, he felt like an intruder, but he had to see her closet. What he found made him laugh. Actually, it made her all the more charming. Most of her wardrobe made noise or was one of the colors of rainbow sherbet ice cream. Sasha would have a stroke if he ever saw it.</p><p>A quick glance at his watch told him his self-imposed time limit was almost out. He jogged up the stairs and then back down to find her office. It could use more shelving and a new desk while the entire second floor with the exception of one guest room needed to be finished. That could be a project for him to do while he was trying to woo back his wife.</p><p>Glancing at his watch, he put on his mental armor.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>It had taken Christian a good ten minutes to find her. She sat hunched over a wooden picnic table, seemingly staring at the small waves that lapped at the shore.</p><p>The sun dipped low in the sky behind them, casting gloomy shadows on the sandy expanse. To his right, what looked to be an old mansion with a double balcony sat surrounded by live oaks and Magnolia trees. A woman paced back and forth, blond hair trailing out behind her. Fireflies seemed to follow her as she walked. Soon, a dark haired man appeared and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>Was that Gabriel?</p><p>He blinked, then blinked again. The balcony was empty of people and fireflies. \u201cDid you see the woman walking with all the fireflies?\u201d</p><p>Zoe shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThis is an absolutely fantastic beach. No worry of shark attacks, jelly fish and most importantly no fear of seeing a three hundred pound bloke wearing a Speedo with black socks and white trainers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A small smile flitted across her lips. \u201cYou haven\u2019t met Uncle Jethro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is the next get together? I\u2019ll be sure to say hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s next month,\u201d she said softly, turning to face him. His heart bumped against his chest when he saw she\u2019d been crying. God, all he did was make her cry. \u201cYou\u2019ll be gone before then.\u201d</p> <p>He ignored her statement. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t recognize you when you showed up that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d she said, her lips twisting. \u201cYou looked like you couldn\u2019t have cared less, and you sounded like an ass. Are you normally that gracious to your fans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked very beautiful that night and you tasted like heaven,\u201d he said, \u201cI thought you were my twenty-first birthday present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d missed the first, the second and last time we kissed,\u201d she said, rising from the table and moving towards the path that led to her house.</p><p>This was not going well at all. He trailed behind her. \u201cZoe, wait up. We have to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou need to leave. I need to write... about villains. Evil villains that break hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to mend yours with pieces of mine.\u201d</p><p>She whirled on him. \u201cStop giving me lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d He touched her cheek. His heart plummeted to his stomach when she flinched.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. Not right now.\u201d She drew in a deep breath and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d He pressed a kiss to the top of her head. Her soft cheek. \u201cLet me in, Zoe.\u201d He trailed his lips down to the corner of her mouth.</p> <p>She trembled and he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>He rejoiced when she melted into him. Brushing his mouth against hers, he tasted the salty tears on them. \u201cLet me stay.\u201d</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>He slanted his mouth over hers, nibbling and teasing her tightly closed lips until they parted in sweet surrender. Just as he swept his tongue inside of her mouth, she tore away.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She ran from him.</p><p>He followed her, keeping his distance.</p><p>She slammed her door shut and the lock clicked in place. Lights flicked on as she made her way through the house. He met her on the front porch just as she locked the screen door. The light beside the entrance gave off a soft glow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow evening.\u201d</p> <p>Zoe\u2019s arms crossed over her chest. \u201cI won\u2019t be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out with Melanie.\u201d</p><p>Most likely she was telling the truth, but he wouldn\u2019t let it deter him. \u201cWhat about Friday evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo place you\u2019d be seen in. Might get your clothes dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019ve been to places you\u2019ve only written about. Now, where will you be?\u201d he asked, his voice even and calm. Not bad for a man who wanted to tear down the barrier between them with his bare hands.</p><p>\u201cPoor Boy\u2019s,\u201d she said, then tilted up her nose. \u201cYou can figure out where that is or have Sasha do a background check on it.\u201d She moved to shut the door. \u201cHave a good night.\u201d</p><p>He stood there, facing the door locked to him. He walked over to one of the rocking chairs on her front porch and sat down.</p><p>A dog howled in the distance.</p><p>Christian grimaced at the lonely sound. \u201cKnow just how you feel, mate.\u201d</p><p>The porch light went dark. \u201cGo home, Christian.\u201d</p><p>She called him Christian. Not Ian. He grinned. \u201cAlready here, love,\u201d he shouted back. \u201cI\u2019m already here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Poor Boy\u2019s was a rundown honky-tonk that boasted sticky wood floors, cheap beer and live bands. The men in here wore dark jeans, t-shirts and the occasional preppy golf shirt. While the women were dressed in everything from sweaters and jeans to two strips of fabric covering their naughty bits. A sight familiar the world over.</p><p>Then there was his wife, the gypsy, standing with two of her brothers. She wore an embroidered top in a soft yellow color and a light green skirt that had pleats in it like an accordion. His fingers itched to drag up the material above her thighs while he kissed the soft hollow in her neck.</p><p>Presently, his brothers-in-law were giving him crossed arms over the chest glares. He lifted his beer in salute as Zoe\u2019s brother, Luke, eyes narrowed in on him. There was no way any of them were going to scare him off. He\u2019d faced worse and lived to tell the tale. Produced it even.</p><p>Christian ticked his chin up slightly, nodding to a corn-fed farmboy with hands as big as his head when the bloke man-checked him. And yes, Christian knew he didn\u2019t belong here. Didn\u2019t look the part and wasn\u2019t willing to conform. He thought of all the places he could be at this moment. Paris, London, Beijing or even St. Petersburg. Holy hell, he could be in Majorca right now, sunning himself with Zoe at his side.</p><p>But where was he? In a third rate bar, hanging out in the shadows like a first rate stalker.</p><p>She happened to glance in his direction and frown. He motioned her over, but she tilted her nose in the air and whirled away.</p><p>Stubborn ass woman. It was one of the things he loved about her.</p><p>He took a long pull of his beer and set the bottle down, pulling at the edge of the label until it curled over. In a few months he\u2019d be five years older than when he met her. And he was determined to celebrate with Zoe.</p><p>His phone vibrated as a text from Sasha appeared. Christian had to read it a couple of times before he shoved the thing back into his pocket. He cursed silently and stood, leaving a tip for the flirtatious server and left.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean the pictures have gone viral?\u201d Christian growled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being punished for leaving. Sorry, I had no choice in the matter, but there\u2019s speculation as to whether it\u2019s you or your brother,\u201d came Sasha\u2019s reply before they lost signal.</p><p>Holland Springs was like a black hole when it came to cell coverage. He\u2019d had better coverage in the jungles of Burma.</p><p>With a great sigh, he climbed into his rental and headed back to the bed and breakfast he\u2019d stayed last night. For the past two days he\u2019d bided his time, kept his distance and for the most part confined himself to his room.</p><p>The road forked up ahead. To the left lay Zoe and silent recrimination. To the right lay sleep and disturbing dreams.</p><p>And loneliness.</p><p>He clenched his jaw, jerked the wheel and headed home.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Zoe slid her keys across the side table and they fell onto the floor. She smacked her hand against her skirt.</p><p>\u201cI assumed that living with one\u2019s wife was a custom practiced here,\u201d Christian said, rising from the sofa. And he missed her. \u201cBesides, the mattress is rather lumpy at the b&amp;b. Thought I\u2019d give yours a go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been waiting in her house for over an hour. A quick search under the doormat had revealed the hidden key. A habit that needed to change. Immediately. Picking up her keys, he handed them back to her. Their fingers brushed. Desire hit him hard and his gut clenched.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with you,\u201d she said him, her voice shaky.</p><p>He tried very hard to be patient. He tried very hard to keep it together and not touch her. But she tilted that cute little nose of hers and bit her lush bottom lip.</p><p>To hell with patience. He lifted her easily in his arms and strode to her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cPut me down,\u201d she said, but he noticed she didn\u2019t try to wriggle out of his arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, love. I don\u2019t plan on sleeping with you either.\u201d He held her closer and breathed in her familiar scent. What an idiot he\u2019d been. She\u2019d smelled just as she always had, like honeysuckle.</p><p>After shutting the door behind him, he let her slide to the floor, making sure she felt every hard inch of him.</p><p>Her breath hitched and he couldn\u2019t wait another second. He tangled his fingers in her hair and brought his mouth to hers. She slid her arms around his neck and he groaned. He followed the lush contours of her body, rubbing the small of her back with his fingers.</p><p>\u201cI need you, Zoe. I missed you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in his arms, tears in her eyes. \u201cI saw pictures of you and that fruit woman. I was inundated with reporters calling and emailing me. I had to change my number. I couldn\u2019t come home for three weeks, because I was afraid they\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>Actually, she\u2019d had nothing to worry about. As soon as he\u2019d learned the press had been hounding her, he\u2019d paid them all off. All but one. The bastard. Then he\u2019d sent security to Palm Island to keep an eye on her.</p><p>\u201cPeaches\u2019 name is Kate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what Pineapple\u2019s name is. She slept with my husband.\u201d Her hand clamped over her mouth and she back away from him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, love. I\u2019m still your husband.\u201d He stalked her across the room, taking off his shirt and tossing it to the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve been entirely faithful to you. Kate\u2019s in love with my brother. Always has been and he\u2019s too preoccupied being up my father\u2019s ass to notice.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the bed. \u201cMaybe she can\u2019t tell the two of you apart.\u201d</p><p>Sitting beside her, he placed his hand over hers. She crossed her arms and scooted away.</p><p>He scanned the room, at a loss as to what to do next. The massive California king had been replaced. A large four poster bed filled the room instead. Settled against the headboard were four of the largest and softest looking pillows he\u2019d ever seen. Multi-colored quilts covered the top and made him want to sink down in it.</p><p>\u201cThis bed looks much better than the other one,\u201d he said. \u201cMore you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave the old one to Heath. He put this one back in here for me,\u201d she said, turning away from him.</p><p>He gently stroked her hair. Spying a brush on the nightstand, he grabbed it. As he brushed the long, silky strands, her shoulders dropped their rigid stance and her head leaned with his strokes.</p><p>Her shoes hit to the floor with a thud. To his astonishment, she stood, letting her shirt fall to the floor and then her ankle length skirt.</p><p>He swallowed. Hard. Dropping the brush, he scooted back on the bed until the cold headboard hit his back.</p><p>Of course, his wife was wearing the pinkest and laciest pair of panties that he\u2019d ever seen. They even had the tiniest of ribbons holding them together at the sides. And she had on above the knee striped knit stockings. Like the kind you\u2019d see in a winter pictorial of a sexy ski bunny.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he said thickly. Miracle of all miracles, she obeyed him.</p><p>Dark hair waved over her shoulders and curled around the pink lace cups of her bra. She crawled across the quilt and straddled his thighs. \u201cSee something you like?\u201d</p><p>Was she insane? Of course he did. He\u2019d dreamed of her wearing every piece of lace imaginable, then slowly removing it from her body with his teeth.</p><p>\u201cDid you wear this because you thought I might be seeing it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, his eyes trained on her pretty dark ones and tugged a lace covered nipple into his mouth. She shifted forward, silk brushing over his cock and making his eyes roll back at the sensation. He sucked harder on the ever tightening bud, until she clutched at his head and gasped.</p><p>Nuzzling the valley between her breasts, he worked at the clasp of her bra until he was able to pull it down and feast on the sight before him. Pink nipples and creamy breasts the same color and size as before, not that he expected anything different. She was perfect. He lifted his eyes to hers. \u201cSo damn beautiful. I wish I were a bloody poet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she commanded softly. He was more than happy to do her bidding. He was her willing slave.</p><p>He skimmed his hands along the curve of her back and shoulders. The softness of her skin never ceased to amaze while her sweet response humbled him. She made him feel loved.</p><p>Tonight, he was going to take his time with her. Worship every inch of her until she knew without a doubt that he loved her and was here to stay.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s lips were on his neck, then his jaw before she licked at his ear and bit down. He growled low in his throat and jerked her closer, hard nipples scraped his bare chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you again.\u201d He leaned in to kiss her, but she turned her head away.</p><p>\u201cNot until morning anyway,\u201d she said, slowly pulling on the ribbons that held her lingerie together, her movements graceful.</p><p>\u201cNot even then,\u201d he insisted, but her lashes lowered hiding her thoughts from him. \u201cLook at me, dammit.\u201d Lashes lifted and he smiled, caressing her face. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. Ever.\u201d This time she didn\u2019t turn when he kissed her. He teased the seam of her mouth until she parted her lips. Sinking his hands into her hair, he growled and kissed her. Hard and deep. He slaked his thirst, his hunger on her, on her lips and tongue.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she whispered against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted up and away from him, her dark hair spilling over his chest as she looked down. The silky strands were like cool water against his overheated skin. They reached for his pants at the same time and all thoughts of going slowly, of savoring the moment fled. Somehow he got his pants off, then his boxer-briefs.</p><p>Her lips wrapped around his cock. He cursed. Her clever tongue slid around the head and he almost came. Sweat gathered on his brow and along his chest as she aroused him further, using her mouth to tempt him to spill.</p><p>\u201cZoe, stop,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>Peering up at him through heavy lidded lashes, she said, \u201cSomething else you wanted?\u201d She licked the length of him.</p><p>He grabbed the bedcovers, fisting them tightly. \u201cYes...Christ...yes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaning to one side, she opened up the top drawer of the night stand and pulled out a condom. She ripped off the foil, then grabbed his cock. For a moment he was content to let her stroke him, until a small bead of pre-cum appeared.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d His command more a plea.</p><p>Rolling the condom on, she positioned herself above him. His back bowed off the bed when he felt the first slide of her tight heat onto his erection. He let his head fall back and eyes close as she took control.</p> <p>She rocked upon him, bearing her hands on his chest and taking him deep inside. Unable to not touch her, he opened his eyes and grabbed her ass, helping her ride him.</p><p>White teeth bit down on her bottom lip as she moved, seemingly holding back any verbal response.</p><p>He slid his fingers between her curls, where she was hot, swollen and wet. Crying out, she rocked faster, her breasts bouncing and her hair flowing down her back.</p><p>She shoved his hand away. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d let her satisfy him only.</p> <p>Pushing her off of him and down onto the quilts, he buried his head between her thighs. She tensed, shivered and let out a small moan. Knit stockings rubbed his back when he placed her legs over his shoulders and spread her wider, seeking to have his fill.</p><p>Over and over, he licked and sucked at her, reveling in her taste and scent. How could he have not known this was the woman he\u2019d been searching for? She tasted uniquely Zoe. Undeniably his.</p><p>He stiffened his tongue and plunged it inside, then stroked his thumb across that swollen part of her. She moaned louder than before, her fingers tugging at his hair. He stroked her again. Her entire body trembled, her nipples tightened to hard points and she cried out his name. The sweetest sound he thought he\u2019d never hear again.</p><p>Flipping her over, Christian mounted her from behind and sank deep inside. Hot. Wet. Tight. He drove deeper, utterly consumed by her. She filled his empty body. His heart. His soul.</p><p>She gripped the footboard, her knuckles whitening. Convinced he was being too rough, he stopped. She made a sound of frustration and pushed back on him. \u201cNo...don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He steadied her hips in his hands and surged inside. Once, twice, a third and then a fourth and final time when his own orgasm claimed him. \u201cI love you, Zoe. I never stopped,\u201d he managed to say. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you ever again. Not tomorrow. Not next year. Not fifty years from now.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Zoe wanted to believe him, wanted to be confident in his words, but it was difficult.</p><p>Raw pain resided in her heart and soul. Still, she had made a conscious decision to have sex with him. As if on some idiot quest to make him leave. To prove that he was exactly the heartless playboy actor the world knew him to be.</p><p>But it had turned into something more. It had turned into making love.</p><p>The mattress dipped as he moved away from her, heading to the bathroom. She dropped to her side, tracing the pattern on the quilt at the end of her bed.</p><p>\u201cIt worries me to see a woman thinking so hard and so long without speaking,\u201d Christian said teasingly, his eyes seemingly full of love, as he approached the bed. Their icy veneer had melted and his entire demeanor was relaxed. As if he knew she was his. That she had succumbed to him. Once again.</p><p>\u201cAfraid I was comparing you to Gabriel?\u201d</p><p>His perfect mouth twisted. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no danger of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI slept with him when I came home,\u201d she said, trying to hurt him with a lie. Just leave already, she wanted to scream, then guilt assailed her. This was so not her.</p><p>\u201cYou were alone on Palm Island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Outrage filled her, chasing away the guilt. \u201cYou were spying on me?\u201d Well, that would explain the two men she had seen walking up and down the mostly empty cul-de-sac her family\u2019s beach house sat on, day after day.</p><p>\u201cGotta protect my assets.\u201d He reached for her, but she scooted away.</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. That stupid post nuptial I signed had an adultery clause. Too bad it didn\u2019t extend to you.\u201d Sliding from the bed, she grabbed her robe and headed to her office.</p><p>\u201cI have not been with anyone else. From the moment I rammed into you at the airport, I have only been with you.\u201d His heavy footsteps sounded behind her. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s no way in hell we would have had sex if you didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>True, but she wouldn\u2019t admit it. She slammed the door, not bothering to lock it.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I want to continue this relationship.\u201d After flipping on the lights, she started up her laptop and turned on the printer.</p><p>\u201cLet me in, Zoe,\u201d came his terse command.</p><p>She ignored him, searching through her email, until she found what she wanted and hit the print button. She grabbed a pen and waited for the last page to pop out of the printer.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>He strode in, took one look at the pen in her hand and snatched it away. It landed on the floor and rolled under the bookshelf near it. He grabbed the sheets of paper from the tray and began to slowly tear them in two directions, his eyes boring into hers as he did.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be an annulment.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019ll divorce you,\u201d she threatened, her heart not in it.</p><p>White pieces flew in the air like confetti at a New Year\u2019s Eve party. \u201cThe hell you will. I love you. You love me and that\u2019s all we need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t one of your movies. You can\u2019t just show up, quasi-quote a Beatles\u2019 lyric to me and expect things will go back to the way they were before,\u201d she said, stepping back when he took a step forward. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you or your reasons for being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me the chance to prove that I\u2019m trustworthy, that I am here for us,\u201d he said, surprising her with the quiet intensity of his voice. \u201cOne month. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t last two days being married to me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw worked and eyes glittered in the light. \u201cPlease, Zoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what? Please forgive you for not being able to handle a relationship like a gown man? For throwing my love for you back in my face? For cutting me into pieces\u2014again? For not attempting to talk to me about that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all of that and more.\u201d There were no explanations. No excuses. No trying to pawn his behavior off on her. His honesty was the one thing that could convince her to take another chance.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, turning to leave the room. \u201cThe guest room has clean sheets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, sweetheart. I fully expect you to participate in this. That means you treat me like your husband, your lover and your friend. If you still can\u2019t see us together at the end, then you can tell me to leave. I\u2019ll give you whatever you want. Annulment. Divorce. Whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Gabriel?\u201d She turned to face him, unable to believe what he was saying or offering.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Gabriel?\u201d he repeated, sounding so smug that she uncrossed her arms and threw them out in frustration, smacking a picture off of her desk.</p><p>Glass cracked and shattered all over the smooth wood floors. She let out a horrified cry, bending down to pick up the pieces. \u201cGood Lord, I just lose it around you.\u201d A jagged piece stabbed in her fingers. \u201cDammit!\u201d They started to throb and bleed. She quickly stuffed them in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to bleed to death?\u201d Christian grabbed her by the elbow and directed her to the hall bathroom. He pointed at the toilet. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>He looked through the vanity cabinet, muttering to himself about wrapping her in bubble wrap and never letting her leave the house.</p><p>Zoe bit her lip as he cleaned each cut, making small noises as the antiseptic burned. Well, she wasn\u2019t buying that stuff again. The label clearly read that it was pain free. False advertising at its finest. Okay, maybe she didn\u2019t really read the label that closely, because pretty soon the throbbing was gone and Christian was wrapping cartoon character band-aids around her fingers.</p><p>\u201cThose are for my niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmithAnn, right?\u201d Christian asked, cleaning up the counter. \u201cHer favorite is the sparkly unicorn that sings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Surely that wasn\u2019t on her background check.</p><p>He gave her a tender smile before checking her other hand. \u201cI saw the DVDs in your collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you see?\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment as she thought about all the movies he\u2019d starred in lined up along the shelves of the entertainment center.</p><p>\u201cAn endless supply of what\u2019s his face. You women are incredibly solidified in your pirate fantasies.\u201d His blonde hair gleamed under the soft lights of her bathroom. His skin looked darker than before and he had a small scar on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get hurt?\u201d she asked, touching the jagged line, then moving him into the light to see it better.</p><p>\u201cBurma. Happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d She let her hands fall. He really had been there. Just like he said. \u201cSo is it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, completely confused by his question.</p><p>He led her back to her bedroom. \u201cThe Florence Nightingale thing you told me about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t there to take care of you when this happened.\u201d She gestured to the fading scar.</p><p>He lifted her hand and kissed the palm. \u201cI\u2019m here to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. Oh, this was so stupid. So completely fool hardy but she would take the chance. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make it easy for you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wicked smile, untying her robe and sliding his hands inside. \u201cAs if I\u2019d expect anything else, but I\u2019m aiming to win.\u201d He pushed it over her shoulders, cool air hitting her skin and making her shiver.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, knowing full well what was going to happen between them. And she was eager for it. For him.</p><p>Loving Christian with her body was the easy part. It was surrendering her heart that was brutal. One month. She could outlast him for that long. She could put up the highest of barriers between them and wrap it in thorns. There was no way he\u2019d bother climbing them if he was being satisfied in other areas.</p><p>He wrapped his hands around her waist and pulled her close. \u201cMaking love to my wife.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>The next morning brought a Carolina sunrise and blue skies. A blurry one-eyed look at her clock told her it was oh-my-God-o\u2019clock. She snuggled deeper under the covers, tentatively searching for Christian with her toes.</p><p>\u201cStill here,\u201d he said, his voice smooth and deep.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Zoe yelped as large hands grabbed her. His body made contact with hers. It was very male, very muscular and \u2013she wiggled her butt against his groin\u2014very aroused. Her traitorous body responded by getting all tingly in anticipation.</p><p>Last night he\u2019d made her come so many times, she\u2019d lost count. But she did know that every time he reached for her, she was already reaching for him. Holding him close and wrapping herself around his lean body.</p><p>He rose over her, eyes crinkling at the corners. His tan shoulders gleamed in the morning sun as its rays highlighted the room through lacy curtains. \u201cSuch a shame, because I\u2019ve been looking for you for years.\u201d</p><p>Her heart did slammed against her chest as he bent down to kiss her. \u201cYou should\u2019ve looked harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve told me your real name,\u201d he murmured against her lips. Then he sat back, taking her with him so that her head lay on his chest. \u201cIs there any other time we\u2019ve met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there was this one time at band camp,\u201d she said and then snorted. His chest shook as he laughed with her.</p><p>His muscular arms tightened around her. \u201cThe sun is shining, my beautiful wife is in my arms\u2014nude, mind you\u2014and my feet are warm. This is actually the best morning I\u2019ve had in a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d she whispered against his warm skin, tracing the rose tattoo on his pectoral with a sparkly unicorn covered fingertip.</p><p>If only she could be sure he\u2019d stay this time. Heck, if she could only be sure he wasn\u2019t using her to make up for bad press. She hated the old adage of only time will tell, because she was sick of waiting on a man. But this time he was waiting on her decision of whether he stayed or would be given his walking papers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like for you to wear my ring again,\u201d he said, his fingers sifting through her hair.</p><p>That was the worst possible thing for him to say. Every time he\u2019d ever given her jewelry, they ended up apart. She sat up, wincing as the long strands got tangled up in his fingers. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He cupped his hands around her shoulders, stopping her from leaving. \u201cWill you think about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to take a shower.\u201d Pushing away the covers, she hopped out of bed and ran like a coward to bathroom.</p><p>Breathing deeply, she turned on the sink and splashed cold water on her face. The light spilling through the picture window caught her eye and she stared, watching as hummingbirds and butterflies flitted from flower to flower. The room was cold and goose bumps appeared on her legs, chest and arms. She rubbed her arms vigorously, wondering how she was going to keep an emotional distance from him. Twice last night she\u2019d been tempted to blurt out that she loved him.</p><p>\u201cZoe?\u201d</p><p>She shoved the shower handle from cold to hot. Water cascaded to the sea glass covered floor. \u201cI\u2019m busy right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to know that I have to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d she muttered. Why should he stay? But the familiar pain threatened to overwhelm her. She had been so stupid. So... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have to run some errands and get my things. Is there anything you need?\u201d</p><p>Okay, she hadn\u2019t been expecting that. She eyed the honeysuckle shampoo and conditioner sitting on the corner of the shower bench. She could use more of that. Oh, and groceries. Let him do the mundane things a husband would do. Things that would completely bore him and make him realize that this\u2014them\u2014was not going to work. \u201cCould you go into town and get me some of my hair stuff? I get it at Carolina Dreams on Ivy Lane. Rose Holland makes it for me,\u201d she said, stepping into the shower and closing the glass door. \u201cAnd if you want stuff to eat, you\u2019d better head to the nearest grocery store. I haven\u2019t had time to shop.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s hand hovered above the doorknob. The sound of the water sluicing over her body made him hard. It would be so easy to join her, pleasure her and spend the rest of the day in bed. But he had to go. And then come back.</p> <p>Zoe had to realize, had to unequivocally be made aware, that he kept his word. That he wanted to be with her. \u201cI\u2019ll see you this afternoon, love. It might take me a while to get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake all the time you need,\u201d she yelled over the noise of the shower.</p><p>He lifted his eyebrow and twisted his lips in amusement at her answer. After getting a shower in the guest bathroom and dressing in the spare clothes he had stashed in his rental, he headed out the front door to find Sasha waiting for him.</p><p>His cousin leaned against a black Mercedes. A driver held open the door.</p><p>Christian raked a hand through his hair. This wasn\u2019t the way to travel through Zoe\u2019s hometown. Honestly, it didn\u2019t matter. Getting her back was his number one goal and nothing would stop him. Including whatever his father had instructed Sasha to do.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Sasha asked, correctly reading his look of annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for attention. I\u2019m here to get my wife back.\u201d</p><p>Sasha sighed. \u201cFine, but I\u2019m not, under any circumstances, riding in a jacked-up anything.\u201d</p><p>Now this was the Sasha he knew. \u201cWill a Suburban do, your highness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>After sending the car and their driver on his way, the two made their way to town, passing farm after farm.</p> <p>\u201cGood God, this place is bucolic,\u201d Sasha said as they passed yet another pasture of cows grazing.</p><p>Christian couldn\u2019t have agreed more, but that\u2019s what he liked about Holland Springs. \u201cQuit being such a damned snob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly content with my snobbery and the knowledge that I will never, ever live in a place like this,\u201d Sasha said. \u201cWant to go cow tipping this evening? I hear it\u2019s all the rage \u2018round these here parts. Maybe if you bring Zoe the prized heifer she\u2019ll know you\u2019re totally serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJob security has never been a worry of yours, has it?\u201d Christian fiddled with the radio, glancing down for only a moment.</p><p>\u201cBrakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christian slammed on the brakes, coming to a stop mere inches from a parade of ducks and their goslings. The mothers of the group squawked at the Suburban. At the very end a black cat trotted after them, nudging the last baby duck in line with its nose.</p><p>The cat stopped in the middle of the road, staring at them with eerie blue eyes.</p><p>He felt rather than saw Sasha stiffen. \u201cThis has got to be the strangest place we\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEven weirder than Madam Flower\u2019s?\u201d Christian asked, referring to the week they\u2019d spent in Monaco and in the company of some very talented women. Well, if one could call their depraved specialties talents.</p><p>Christian tapped the horn and the cat sauntered away, flicking its tail. He pressed the gas, relieved to see the sign for the town after ten minutes of driving</p><p>\u201cA great big emphatic yes,\u201d Sasha said. \u201cNo more of that kind of thing for you. Unless you can talk Zoe into putting a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander,\u201d Christian said with a warning note in his voice. \u201cYou know, I cannot wait for you to meet the woman that makes your life a living hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause being controlled by my uncle, your father, isn\u2019t enough?\u201d Sasha had him there. \u201cBy the way, I was the one who slipped your ring in your pocket. Brennen thought he was playing a fantastic joke on you, but I was trying to make it up to you both.\u201d</p><p>Christian grinned. \u201cI knew there was a reason I kept you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brilliant conversation skills aren\u2019t enough?\u201d</p><p>Christian made a left onto Ivy Lane, pulling into an empty parking spot. He turned to his cousin and punched him in the shoulder. \u201cGod love you, Sasha.\u201d</p><p>After leaving the apothecary shop on Ivy, Christian peered at his cousin who was unusually quiet. \u201cHave all my packages arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Sasha replied, staring out of the passenger window.</p><p>Christian stopped for a red light. \u201cWhen will my piano be delivered? I would like to start playing again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh- huh.\u201d</p><p>What the hell was wrong with Sasha? \u201cI\u2019ve decided to quit acting and take up quilting.\u201d Again, his cousin answered with the same tone. \u201cYou\u2019ll join me of course. Collecting scraps, sewing edges. Shaving dogs for the stuffing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014what?\u201d Sasha\u2019s lips rose on one side. \u201cHave you gone mental?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I think you have. Anyway, what\u2019s the status on my things?\u201d</p><p>Sasha pulled out his blackberry and touched the screen. \u201cQuite a few have already arrived and are waiting for you at Chesson House. The rest should be here by the end of next week.\u201d</p><p>The light turned green and Christian drove to the town\u2019s one grocery store. \u201cFantastic. The sooner Zoe sees I\u2019m here to stay, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Sasha said, once again distracted by something. Or was it someone?</p><p>Rose Holland, one of the owners of Carolina Dreams, had had an uncommon effect on his cousin. Sasha had been virtually silent as soon as he saw her, then rude. To a woman he\u2019d never met before.</p><p>Christian had apologized profusely to Rose before they left, but it didn\u2019t look like that had helped. Rose had fixed Sasha with a look so cold that even Christian had shivered. Almost as if the room had dropped about thirty degrees. At one point Christian could have sworn he saw his breath coming out.</p><p>\u201cRose got your tongue?\u201d Christian teased.</p><p>Sasha rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cShe\u2019s got more than my tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Sasha said, then tapped his fingers against his thigh. \u201cLet\u2019s get the rest of your honey-do list over with. I need to fly back to London this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummoned by Vladimir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Well, that was that. \u201cHave you found out any more information about who\u2019s scooped the pictures of me? Currently, my agent and I aren\u2019t speaking.\u201d Martha hadn\u2019t bothered to answer the last three emails Christian had sent her either, but she hadn\u2019t ended their business relationship. Yet.</p><p>\u201cThe two bloggers that have it are holding out until confirmation. Perhaps this can be contained after all? Why don\u2019t you let me put out a statement about you and the wife. Generate some buzz.\u201d</p><p>The second and last stop light at the town\u2019s only major intersection changed to red. Christian slowed the SUV to stop. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m not using her for personal gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this could be the end of everything,\u201d Sasha protested, but Christian could tell his cousin\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t in it.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Christian said. He\u2019d find a way to keep B.T.S. funded, without them knowing about it. He didn\u2019t need their approval anymore, only his wife\u2019s.</p><p>His cousin clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cProud of you, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite sentimental of you, Alexander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get all watery. I think you\u2019ve completely lost it.\u201d</p><p>The light turned green. Christian slammed down on the gas pedal, laughing as Sasha was unceremoniously thrown back against the leather seat. \u201cI hope to God I never find it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>It had taken Christian longer than he\u2019d like to get all of his errands accomplished and by the time he\u2019d returned home\u2014yes, he was most definitely calling Zoe\u2019s house that\u2014it was almost four in the afternoon.</p><p>He\u2019d dropped off Sasha, who was still moody as hell, at the airport before driving like a bat out of hell, keeping his eyes peeled for any animals on parade.</p><p>Once again, he took some time to check out his new digs. The two-story home had gingerbread lattice work and large porches on the front and back. The siding was painted a bright white while the trim was a deep black with matching shutters. Spring flowers bloomed in wide flowerbeds along the front and side of the house. A large pecan tree sat off to the side with a sturdy branch hanging low enough for a tire swing.</p><p>He would push his children on that swing. Hear them laugh and play. And he would never pit them against each other. Never tell one that he or she was worthless. Never abuse them.</p><p>The thought of children startled him, but why shouldn\u2019t he think about the future with Zoe? He\u2019d done it all, seen it all (thanks to the duck and cat parade), and had it all.</p><p>With that thought in mind, he grabbed some of the bags from the back of his SUV and headed in the house. After unloading everything and still no sign of Zoe, he headed out the sliding glass door to look for her. Her black Camaro was sitting in the driveway, so she hadn\u2019t gone that route. But anyone could have come and gotten her. She was surrounded by a family that loved her, and, most likely, wanted to murder him.</p><p>Which made them rise in his estimation.</p><p>He found her, sitting on a large quilt under a flowering tree with her hands over her face. She had flowers and ribbons sticking out of the loose braid she wore.</p><p>Zoe\u2019s shoulders shook. The straps of her pink sundress had fallen down to rest on the each side as she trembled. It was the same dress she\u2019d worn when they\u2019d gotten married. Dammit, she was crying. Again. If he wasn\u2019t the biggest ass on the planet, he didn\u2019t know who was. He could have taken her with him instead of needing to prove himself to her. He made a move in her direction.</p><p>She jumped to her feet and yelled, \u201cReady or not, here I come.\u201d</p><p>He stopped short and looked around. A little girl\u2019s giggle sounded to the right of him and he could just make out the blonde curls that were visible over a green bush with yellow flowers. A bright pink bow wobbled at the top as the toddler moved.</p><p>He stayed hidden on the porch, watching as Zoe chased her niece around the back yard, flowers falling with each step. High pitched shrieks punctuated the air until Zoe captured her in a big hug.</p><p>\u201cI hungry, Aunt Zoe,\u201d the little girl said.</p><p>He studied the child. She had to be SmithAnn.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Zoe grabbed the child\u2019s hand, walking to the back porch. \u201cI have all your favorite things in my pantry.\u201d</p><p>So his wife hadn\u2019t needed the groceries after all. Or she thought she was sending him off on a wild goose chase. It didn\u2019t matter, because if that\u2019s what it took to earn her trust, then that\u2019s what he\u2019d do.</p><p>He shoved his hands into his pocket and waited, a big grin on his face. The wind lifted the bottom of Zoe\u2019s dress. She had the loveliest legs and the most tempting thighs. He sucked in a breath and thought of football. Of his agent. Of any damn thing that could put his mind to non-carnal thoughts.</p><p>Zoe opened the screen door, her eyes widening. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be back...\u201d\u2014her eyes flicked down to SmithAnn\u2014\u201cso soon.\u201d</p><p>He bet she didn\u2019t. He grinned at his new niece and got on his knees. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Christian.\u201d</p><p>SmithAnn\u2019s brown eyes mimicked her aunt\u2019s, but for an entirely different reason. \u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d She threw her arms around him, nearly over toppling him. \u201cPrince Ian!\u201d</p><p>Zoe grabbed her niece and pulled her away. \u201cWhat in the world are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI show you!\u201d The little girl tugged on her arm, then placed a chubby hand on Christian\u2019s. \u201cI show you.\u201d</p><p>As her niece led them into house, Zoe couldn\u2019t stop glancing at her husband. He was back. Seriously in the flesh back and had brought groceries. Bags of food covered the island in her kitchen. Suitcases were piled up by her front door. He really was serious about moving in with her.</p><p>\u201cMind if I put my things in your closet?\u201dhe asked.</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>SmithAnn let out a cheer and did what all almost three years old could do. Turn on the flat-screen and work the DVD player. \u201cPrince Ian and Uni!\u201d</p><p>Zoe smacked her mouth with her hand, laughing as Christian appeared on screen. He wore a gold crown and brandished a sword at a cartoon fire-breathing dragon. The perky sparkling unicorn, Uni, appeared by his side. They worked together to rescue the princess. However, the princess ended up saving them from her pet dragon who had only needed a nap to be less cranky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you know that\u2019s some of my finest work as an actor.\u201d Christian\u2019s voice was in her ear, hot breath caressing as his hands touched her hips. \u201cWant to be my princess? I swear I\u2019ll put something harder and larger than a pea in bed with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you could take a children\u2019s fairy tale and make it lascivious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you could say the word lascivious and make me want to bend you over the dining room table.\u201d His hands slid lower, cupping her bottom. \u201cHave I told you how lovely your ass looks when I\u2019m taking you from behind?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She elbowed him in the stomach and he grunted, his hands falling away. \u201cNot while my niece is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen our niece leaves then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmithAnn is spending the night.\u201d That should fix his royal horniness.</p> <p>SmithAnn ran back to them and tugged on his shirt. \u201cCome watch with me. Please?\u201d</p><p>Perfect. Let him have to be around a two year old for the rest of the day and night. He\u2019d be out the door before dessert was served. She started toward her office.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, eyes widening as panic set in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got work to do and as my husband it\u2019s your job to entertain our niece while Melanie and Carter have a date night. Don\u2019t forget to fix her a snack.\u201d Striding down the hall, she grinned in satisfaction. \u201cLet\u2019s see how long you last.\u201d</p><p>Every twenty minutes Zoe would stop writing and sneak a peek at her niece and husband. At first Christian sat stiffly on the sofa beside her, apparently unsure of how to deal with a toddler. But after the third check, he and SmithAnn were having a tea party on the floor.</p> <p>His face was caked in makeup while barrettes made his hair stick out in odd places. A child\u2019s dress up hat perched on the front of his head while a feather boa wrapped around his broad shoulders.</p><p>\u201cMy tea and biscuits are quite delicious, Princess SmithAnn. I\u2019m so delighted you invited me.\u201d He leaned down, pressing the back of his hand against one side of his mouth. \u201cHowever, I would appreciate if you\u2019d tell the hippo with the wonky eye to stay home next time. Can\u2019t hold his tea and keeps hitting on Miss Kitty. Bad form, I say.\u201d</p><p>SmithAnn giggled, clearly enchanted with him.</p><p>Frowning, Zoe leaned against the wall. It didn\u2019t look like he was in any mood to leave.</p><p>\u201cUncle Christian, how long you staying?\u201d</p><p>Pale blue eyes met Zoe\u2019s, pinning her to the wall with the emotion behind them. \u201cForever.\u201d Despite the makeup and silly wardrobe he wore, she\u2019d never felt more attracted to him.</p> <p>Or as in love.</p><p>She could barely form the words, \u201cTime to clean up for supper.\u201d She struggled to maintain a semblance of control. Lightheaded, she tried breathing deeply. After a few measured breaths, she pulled out pots and pans, filling them up with water and a vegetable mix that she planned to stir-fry.</p><p>Christian stood, picking up SmithAnn and following her to the kitchen. All the groceries had been put up and the kitchen was sparkling clean.</p><p>\u201cYou did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmithAnn and I did, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Her niece nodded in agreement. The sparkly tiara she wore tumbled to the counter.</p><p>Zoe picked it up, examining the headpiece. The gems looked real. Her eyes flew to Christian. He was busy seating his newest fan at the kitchen table and providing art supplies.</p><p>\u201cBe right back. I need to wash up. And here you go, my lady,\u201d he said with a flourish of his hat.</p> <p>SmithAnn giggled as the yellow and green concoction was placed on the table beside a familiar wooden bowl of fruit. He\u2019d actually kept that? Her heart flipped in her chest.</p><p>\u201cDid you buy this for SmithAnn?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, it came today,\u201d he said and walked away, all masculine grace.</p><p>She eyed the crown again, turning it around and around as the facets caught the light. \u201cAre these real sapphires?\u201d</p><p>He turned and cast a smile at her. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said with a wink. He disappeared down the hall.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so not funny. You can\u2019t give a two year old real jewelry.\u201d The bathroom door shut. \u201cChristian?\u201d She set the pretty tiara on her own head and sneaked a look at herself in the mirror hanging over the buffet in the dining room.</p><p>\u201cTotally fake,\u201d she said as she pulled it off. She walked back to the kitchen and set it on top of her fridge.</p><p>He returned a few minutes later, face freshly washed and golden hair free of her niece\u2019s artistic hair skills. He placed a kiss Zoe\u2019s cheek, then wandered over to her iPod dock.</p><p>Soft strains of Colbie Caillat\u2019s old hit \u201cI Never Told You\u201d filled the air. Water bubbled in the pot, cooking the noodles for a macaroni and cheese dinner that Melanie never let her daughter have, but at Aunt Zoe\u2019s what momma didn\u2019t know...</p><p>\u201cDance with me,\u201d he said, capturing her hand.</p><p>\u201cI guess I could, but only for twelve minutes.\u201d</p><p>His smile brightened the room.</p><p>They danced. Slowly. Pressed together with his hand riding low on her back, but there was nothing sexual in his embrace. Nothing that would be inappropriate in front of her niece as she drew pictures of castles and butterflies.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a very sweet little girl.\u201d</p><p>Zoe closed her eyes and leaned against his broad chest. \u201cThanks for letting me get my work done.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle rumbled in his chest. \u201cMmm-hmm. I got your number, love.\u201d</p><p>Glancing over at the table to make sure her niece was still occupied, Zoe lifted her chin to look at the man holding her. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I changed it, remember, and I\u2019m not giving it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he murmured and pulled her close again, his breath hot against her hair. \u201cYou know, I actually like the whole family thing we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do this a lot. As in all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to scare me away?\u201d He stroked her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve endured worse than a loving family bent on keeping their sister safe.\u201d</p><p>The reminded of just how loving his family could be, had her sucking in a breath. She pushed at his chest. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arms around her. \u201cNever. And I want a family. Kids. The white picket fence which you already have and a muscle car in the drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you being cruel on purpose?\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth to her ear. \u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to tempt you to stay with me. So I can give you what you want.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean a word of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m completely serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d SmithAnn shouted, wriggling between them.</p><p>Christian laughed, let Zoe go and scooped the toddler up in his arms. \u201cOkay, Me Too. Let\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>Hands shaking, Zoe tried to concentrate on dinner, but all she could think about was his words, seemingly sincere.</p><p>Utterly deadly to her resolve.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Carter looked pointedly at Christian. He took a quick swallow of beer, setting the glass down on the table and leaning back his chair.</p><p>Muttering under his breath, Christian grabbed the large pile of cards in the middle of the table and added them to his hand. This was getting bloody ridiculous. They were playing with two decks and he held the majority of the cards. \u201cHow in the hell did you know that I was lying? I make my living from acting.\u201d</p><p>Carter gave him an enigmatic smile. \u201cI have my ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour turn, Z.\u201d Melanie said.</p><p>Zoe pulled some cards and placed them face down on the table. \u201cThree sevens.\u201d She took a sip of water, elbowing Melanie in the process. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch those bony things!\u201d Melanie quickly put down her own. \u201cOne eight.\u201d</p><p>On and on it in went in rapid succession, until Christian finally realized that something wasn\u2019t right. Someone or ones were cheating. Amazingly enough, everyone had exactly what needed to be played next. No matter what the damn card was.</p><p>He glanced at Zoe, who was concentrating on her remaining cards, with tears in her eyes. And it wasn\u2019t from crying.</p><p>She was silently laughing. At him.</p><p>Christian looked around the large table and realized that they all were. He threw his cards down and held up his hands in mock surrender. \u201cI give up.\u201d</p><p>Everyone burst out laughing.</p><p>\u201cBloody good show, mate,\u201d Heath said, making Christian roll his eyes. If he heard one more jab at his accent, he would start doing some impressions of his own.</p><p>Logan laughed like a deranged hyena. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen someone go that long before. You were so determined to win, but you couldn\u2019t figure out why no one was calling Bullshit on anyone else. Carter put down eight cards when he said two. Eight. Even Zoe was lying through her teeth and trust me, she\u2019s a dead giveaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee thanks, Logan.\u201d Zoe threw her cards at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Z, but you suck at bluffing. You get too excited.\u201d Logan wiped his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut I was quiet the whole time,\u201d Zoe protested, her nose wrinkling.</p><p>\u201cYou always hold your breath and wiggle around when you get really excited.\u201d Christian winked at her. \u201cOnly I\u2019m too polite to call you on it.\u201d He wanted to make her pass out with excitement. Now. Would it be rude to insist that they make an early departure?</p><p>Zoe\u2019s cheeks heated. \u201cThen I must hyperventilate and have ants in my pants when I\u2019m around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, love?\u201d Christian gave her a wicked grin.</p><p>His wife\u2019s cheeks turned scorching red and her eyes rounded. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. What I mean is that I must turn blue and... no...that\u2019s not it either. Well, crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s not talking about what I think he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Luke muttered to Logan and Carter.</p><p>All three of them glared at him.</p><p>Heath nodded, ignoring his brothers\u2019 exchange. \u201cIt was priceless, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s been fun torturing the new guy, but I think it\u2019s time the men went to Poor Boy\u2019s,\u201d Logan said. He stood and fished a set of keys out of his pocket. \u201cWant to come, Ian\u2014Christian? What is your name?\u201d</p><p>Christian took his time piling up the stack of cards. For all intents and purposes these card sharks were his new family. It seemed wrong to ask them to call him by his stage name, but he\u2019d give them the choice. \u201cI\u2019ll answer to either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what do you prefer?\u201d Evangeline asked.</p><p>At least he knew she was on his side. She would direct message him on Twitter, giving him helpful insights about Zoe and what she liked. For nearly two weeks, he\u2019d done everything he could think of to earn her trust and love. But the harder he worked, the more she pulled away. Except when he touched her, then she\u2019d come undone in his arms, giving him her body and frustrating him to no end, because he needed more from her.</p><p>He needed everything.</p><p>\u201cCall me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDipshit?\u201d Luke suggested.</p><p>\u201cWanker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPunkface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNumbnuts is my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, no fair, you can\u2019t go twice, Heath,\u201d Evangeline protested.</p><p>\u201cI vote for eunuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at the dinner table, Luke. That kind of behavior belongs outside.\u201dChristian didn\u2019t know if he should be impressed or scared by Zoe\u2019s mother\u2019s suggestion.</p><p>\u201cAsshat.\u201d That would be his wife\u2019s contribution. Tonight she wore a snug red shirt with hip-hugging jeans. He couldn\u2019t help staring at her cute ass every time she walked around. Hell, he wanted to ask her to go get him something, anything just so he could admire the lovely lines of her body.</p><p>\u201cCall him hot as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvangeline Mae, a lady does not talk about the hotness of another woman\u2019s husband,\u201d Leah reprimanded.</p><p>\u201cBut a lady can say bullshit?\u201d Heath asked Carter out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Their father, Lawton, cleared his throat and peered over the paper he\u2019d been reading.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Heath mumbled, impressing the hell out of Christian.</p><p>Vladimir could stand to learn how not to bitch and moan at his own sons. It was one of the things Christian liked and admired about Zoe\u2019s quiet father. Lawton had invited him over earlier that day to have a come to Jesus meeting with him. Whatever that meant.</p><p>As it had turned out, all Lawton had wanted to know if Christian was serious about making his marriage work. Then his father-in-law had told him in no uncertain terms that the next time Christian got a wild hair up his ass to leave his daughter, he\u2019d track him down and skin him alive.</p><p>\u201cCall him late for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d never call you that, Logan. You always arrive before dinner and then no one else gets any,\u201d Melanie teased, her hand resting on the top of her bulging belly.</p><p>\u201cHow about call an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, really.\u201d Leah chastised from across the room. \u201cI raised you boys better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Luke said, sounding the exact opposite of the word. He tossed a glare Christian\u2019s way. \u201cHow about EMT?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmithAnn calls him Prince Ian,\u201d Carter said with a smirk. \u201cShe\u2019s convinced he can bring that annoying unicorn to her birthday party.\u201d</p><p>Everyone including Zoe laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt was fantastic working with Uni. And SmithAnn was a lovely hostess at our tea while her guests were loads more fun and welcoming. More importantly, they didn\u2019t hoard the biscuits.\u201d He\u2019d make fun of himself before the brothers could. That should shut them up.</p><p>Melanie rewarded him with a smile, then whispered in Zoe\u2019s ear. His wife turned a rosy pink and shook her head. What he wouldn\u2019t give to find out what that had been all about.</p><p>\u201cJolly good,\u201d Heath said in the worst impersonation of an English accent Christian had heard that night.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a right proper gent,\u201d Logan chimed in, making Heath sound like a native speaker. Christian cringed. Okay, make Heath\u2019s the second worst.</p><p>\u201cLook, any man willing to suffer through endless showings of that damn unicorn and play tea party with my daughter has my respect,\u201d Carter said, shocking Christian.</p><p>\u201cThose dishes aren\u2019t going to clean themselves,\u201d Leah called out from her seat on the sofa. \u201cWould you look at that? Who knew a woman with all that money could manage to look so cheap? Bless her heart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The gossip channel his mother-in-law was watching had been muted and every so often he\u2019d get a glimpse of his picture with some woman who was not his wife. Christian wanted to hurl something at the damn screen, but he couldn\u2019t change his past or the fact that everyone was privy to it. Including Zoe.</p><p>She glanced behind her just as an old video of him and Jaylen walking the red carpet was put on repeat. His entire body tensed as she turned back around in her chair, slender shoulders drooping. A small frown appeared on her face.</p><p>\u201cHow can you stand to watch that trash, Momma?\u201d Luke growled.</p> <p>Everyone turned to look and of course it showed him snogging Jaylen before giving the camera the finger. Then shouting what he knew to be profanity-laced sentences or at least what would have passed as a sentence. He\u2019d most likely been drunk at the time, possibly high.</p><p>An uncomfortable silence descended.</p><p>Zoe looked down, pretending to examine the top of the wooden table. Her fingers flexed, the wedding ring that should be sparkling there conspicuously absent. As was his. She\u2019d never given him one. Judging by her body language, he wouldn\u2019t be getting one anytime soon.</p><p>Heath cleared his throat. \u201cWho wants dessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go check on SmithAnn,\u201d Carter said.</p> <p>Logan shot to his feet. \u201cI\u2019ll get the plates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah, did you hear what Chrissy Jean said about Kelly Rae at Daisy\u2019s bakery the other day?\u201d Melanie asked, moving to the living room. \u201cI swear, those two looked like dogs fighting over scraps. \u201c</p><p>Leah held up the remote and clicked off the television, then motioned for Melanie to sit down in the closest chair. \u201cOver Nelson Landry?\u201d</p><p>Everyone but Evangeline got up from the table to crowd around the large island in the middle of the kitchen. She shrugged a shoulder when Christian sent her a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to clean up. That\u2019s the curse of being the youngest. You\u2019ve always got to do the crap jobs.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that the truth? His crap job would be mindlessly spewing Romanov Industries\u2019 mission statement all over the world.</p> <p>He helped her gather up the cards and sort through them, creating two decks again. \u201cHow\u2019s school going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust fine.\u201d Evangeline gave him a brilliant smile, one very like his wife\u2019s. \u201cAre any of your friends coming here?\u201d</p><p>He inwardly sighed at the sight of her sweet face. Now he had a little sister to think of. His friends could stay the hell away from Holland Springs and the women who lived here. \u201cNot any time soon.\u201d</p><p>Her smile fell, but only slightly. \u201cI already know one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who would that be?\u201d He closed the top of the box of cards.</p><p>\u201cLuke wants to kill you,\u201d Evangeline warned, ignoring his question. \u201cHe thinks you\u2019re only here to boost your image, because something bad has happened or is about to happen.\u201d</p><p>That much was obvious. It didn\u2019t take a genius to notice Luke\u2019s fury-filled glare. And those damn pictures of him were still lurking in cyberspace. Still waiting for confirmation on the identity, but he was sure the bloggers and the reporters without standards would be publishing them soon. Ramifications be damned. Christian\u2019s second shot at happiness be damned as well.</p><p>He knew he needed to tell Zoe soon, but he was afraid she would think he was using her. \u201cI\u2019m here because I love your sister and want to stay married to her,\u201d he assured his sister-in-law.</p> <p>Evangeline finished shoving the cards into the two boxes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I figured. You\u2019d have to be either an idiot or desperately in love to come into the lion\u2019s den.\u201d She tilted her head in her brothers\u2019 direction. They were milling around the kitchen, eating and joking with one another.</p><p>Jealousy stabbed him. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he and Sebastian had joked around. Hell, he couldn\u2019t remember the last time they\u2019d spent together that hadn\u2019t involved Christian receiving a dressing down from their father. Zoe\u2019s family teased, cursed and yelled at each other without taking it personally. Without their parents pitting them against each other.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am idiotically, desperately in love with your sister,\u201d he said with a wink and a grin.</p><p>Zoe carried a plate of cookies and a glass of milk over to Melanie, who was sitting in a chair with her feet propped up on an ottoman. She sat on the arm, talking to Melanie or rather her belly. He couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off of her as she made silly faces while talking in a sing-songy voice. She\u2019d make an excellent mother. To his children. Their children.</p><p>A warm, fuzzy feeling settled in his bones. They could live here, follow Zoe\u2019s routine, and be deliriously happy. Just like she\u2019d always wanted and now like he did, too.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you leave and let her have a normal relationship?\u201d</p><p>Christian looked up to find Luke in Evangeline\u2019s place at the table. He leaned back in his chair, trying to keep his voice smooth and his face impassive as he faced a challenge nearly as formidable as his wife.</p><p>\u201cObviously, Zoe craves something different. She broke up with Mr. Normal months ago and it wasn\u2019t the first time,\u201d he pointed out. No, the first time had happened before she\u2019d moved out to California and kissed him. Had had a one night stand with him. Christian rubbed his thumb along the bottom of his glass, wiping away the condensation that had gathered.</p><p>\u201cYou two broke up last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re back together.\u201d Christian glowered at Luke from beneath his brows.</p><p>\u201cUntil you get bored or don\u2019t need her to fix your rep.\u201d</p><p>White-hot fury flashed through Christian. \u201cI\u2019m not having this conversation with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait.\u201d Luke slouched down in his chair, a slow grin covering his face. \u201cUnlike you, I know how to stick around.\u201d</p><p>Christian suddenly remembered a little tidbit Zoe\u2019d inadvertently let slip out about Luke and his ex. \u201cIs that how Lily Sawyer would see things?\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s jaw clenched and his eyes flared. \u201cI\u2019d hate to mess up that pretty face of yours, Romanov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it would put a damper on the whole do no harm creed you doctors have. And as flattered as I am that you think I\u2019m pretty, I\u2019m married.\u201d Christian looked around the room, struggling to keep his temper under control.</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable. You can\u2019t even say anything original. Does your personal assistant have to email you a script to get through the day?\u201d Luke leaned forward, placing his hands on the table between them. \u201cYou might have everyone else fooled, but not me. I know why you\u2019re here: You need my sister to save your ass again and make you look good to everyone.\u201d Luke rapped his knuckles on the table. \u201cThing is, deep down inside, you know you\u2019ll never be good enough for her.\u201d</p><p>Wisely, Christian kept his mouth shut. It wasn\u2019t as if Luke wasn\u2019t correct and Christian knew it. But selfish bastard that he was, there was no way in hell Christian was going to help Zoe realize it any sooner than she had to.</p><p>A full moon lit Zoe and Christian\u2019s path as they walked home. Tall pine trees swayed when a blustery wind gusted.</p><p>Zoe wrapped her coat tightly around her, wishing for the summer-like weather that had disappeared when the sun set. Hair dancing around her head smacked her in the face, making her eyes water.</p><p>She brushed it away and glanced up at the black sky, noting the large clouds rolling in. \u201cIt smells like rain.\u201d</p><p>Christian walked beside her, unusually subdued.</p><p>Lacing her fingers through his long, tapered ones, she tried again. \u201cYou sure are quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m still reeling from the shock of discovering how close you live to your parents,\u201d he said, lightly squeezing her hand.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s fifteen minutes to their house from mine.\u201d Ours, she wanted to say, but her feelings were still hurt by what she\u2019d seen on television. How did other women do it? How did they reconcile themselves to their husbands\u2019 well-documented and broadcasted pasts while trying to look to the future? And in front of their families. It was one thing to see it in private, but like that, with everyone\u2019s attention on her and Christian, it had been excruciating. Suffocating. It had taken every ounce of willpower not to order him to leave, then run home.</p><p>\u201cOnly by car. By foot it\u2019s less than five,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m having visions of your mother walking in on us, but I\u2019ll be respectful by not kicking her out when it happens. Over and over and over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to tell her to eff-off while giving her the finger. How inconvenient for you.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, turning to look at her. \u201cI know how to comport myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, your classiness shined on the red carpet in that video. Shoving your tongue down your lover\u2019s throat was an extra special touch.\u201d She jerked her hand away and stomped ahead of him, but her short legs couldn\u2019t put enough distance between them and he was soon caught up to her.</p><p>\u201cEx-lover, remember? I swear to God, Zoe. It\u2019s one step forward and a million steps back with you,\u201d he said, obvious frustration filling his tone.</p><p>She stopped in her tracks. \u201cYou think it\u2019s fun to watch you with other women? You don\u2019t think that your display of affection with your ex-lover didn\u2019t humiliate me? My family saw you, Christian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help what your mother chooses to watch,\u201d he said and even though it was true, it still stung and hurt.</p><p>\u201cHow would you like to see videos of me and Gabriel kissing? Sex tapes?\u201d</p><p>He splayed his arms wide. \u201cI don\u2019t have to. Every damn photo of you in that house has Gabriel at your side.\u201d His face changed as though he realized what she\u2019d just said. \u201cWhat sex tapes?\u201d</p><p>Only the one you\u2019d mentioned in front of Gabriel, she wanted to say. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she said with a toss of her hair. There, that should fix him.</p><p>The next thing she knew his hands were around her upper arms and he\u2019d propelled her against a tree. The rough bark caught at her hair and tugged painfully at her scalp. He loomed over her, his broad shoulders blocking out the moon. His face was wreathed in shadows, but by some trick of the light, she could see the color of his eyes as they burned in his face.</p><p>\u201cHow many and with whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou first or can\u2019t you count that high?\u201d His hands were gentle, and she knew instinctively he\u2019d never hurt her.</p><p>\u201cFive and the only one whose name I care to remember is yours. Now, will you be adding or subtracting to my number?\u201d His perfect lips thinned as he waited for her response.</p><p>She tilted her nose in the air. \u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdding or subtracting, love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d she whispered, not wanting to play any more games with him.</p><p>\u201cI swore I wouldn\u2019t ask this and that I didn\u2019t care, but how many lovers have you had? How many men have touched your beautiful body? How many have plunged deep inside of you, experiencing every little flutter and the lush moans you make when you\u2019re completely filled to,\u201d He teased the hollow of her throat with an long finger, \u201chere?\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath, aroused by his words and blatant display of jealousy. \u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>Christian\u2019s mouth lowered to hers, brushing over her lips with infinite gentleness. \u201cI promise not to be angry.\u201d He raised his head and barked out a laugh, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t promise that. Tell me, baby. How many?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing hard, she said, \u201cJust you. Happy?\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open.</p><p>She shrugged out of his embrace, ducked under his arm, and left him standing in the space they\u2019d both occupied.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Four</p><p>It was past midnight when Christian\u2019s Suburban pulled in the drive. The headlights beamed briefly through the front picture window of her house. Her heart tripled its beat.</p><p>She clicked the television off and quickly headed to her office, still unwilling and too angry to talk to him. Even after two hours of fuming. Of staring at his clothes in her closet. His shaving kit with her cosmetics. His ridiculous\u2014okay, cute\u2014PEZ collection mixed in with her crystal fairies. The coyote one had looked like he was about to take a bite out of the closest wood sprite, so she\u2019d flicked him over with the tip of her finger.</p><p>In less than three weeks\u2019 time Christian had made his mark on her home, but it wasn\u2019t overpowering. He didn\u2019t demand she change anything. Didn\u2019t criticize her taste or lack of it, according to her mother. Only blended in as if his things had always been there. As if he had always been there as well.</p><p>The door opened and shut, Christian\u2019s heavy footsteps coming to a stop.</p><p>\u201cWatch it, Miss Wood Sprite. Mr. Coyote will not be happy if you keep teasing him,\u201d she heard him say. \u201cThere, everyone\u2019s as they should be. Cheers.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, trying not to be charmed by his antics.</p><p>A few seconds later, he stood in the doorway, watching her with hooded eyes.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun with my brothers?\u201d she asked coolly, keeping her fingers moving over the keyboard.</p><p>\u201cActually, it wasn\u2019t bad. Heath\u2019s a good sort, Logan bought my drinks, and as long as I don\u2019t ever turn my back on Luke, I\u2019ll keep living to see the next day,\u201d he said, his playful mood nothing like the man in the forest. \u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA scene with Dimitri and Katrina.\u201d She tensed, pain starting along the lines of her shoulder blades. Maybe this would be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. He hadn\u2019t said anything about her writing since moving in with her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know, I finished reading your books.\u201d</p><p>The pain traveled to her neck. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite pleased with how you\u2019ve portrayed Dimitri.\u201d He shoved his hands in his pockets and leaned against one side of the doorframe. \u201cI can see why your fans love him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo the fact that I\u2019m continuing the series isn\u2019t a deal breaker for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want it to be?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, mulling over the answers that would make him stay or possibly jumpstart his departure. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop writing something I love.\u201d The light in his impossibly beautiful eyes dimmed. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to hurt you either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have overreacted to your confession.\u201d One side of his mouth curved up and the pain inside of her eased. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to hurt you either. You don\u2019t need my permission to write anything. Just...you hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere does that leave us?\u201d</p> <p>His smile became wicked. \u201cIt leaves me with the expectation that Dimitri will remain your fans\u2019 favorite and not that do-gooder Joshua.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you do?\u201d She hadn\u2019t realized how much she needed his forgiveness, his acceptance and understanding until this moment.</p><p>\u201cDimitri is based on me, after all.\u201d He wriggled his brows at her, then moved to stand behind her. His hands came down on her shoulders, massaging her back and working out knots she didn\u2019t know existed. \u201cHe licked her quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog? I\u2019ve never heard the female anatomy described quite like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She glanced at her screen. Sure enough she\u2019d written that sentence about ten times in a row, in the middle of a love scene. \u201cOh that. I always type something silly when I have writer\u2019s block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other ways to get inspired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d she asked, then it dawned on her. \u201cChristian!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust trying to help.\u201d His thumbs continued to move in lazy circles. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she hedged, knowing the subject had moved from fictional characters to them. And that night.</p><p>He swiveled her chair around and kneeled before her. \u201cThat it was your first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did tell you.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cAs faulty as a man\u2019s memory can be, I am actually quite certain I would have remembered the words \u2018I am a virgin\u2019 coming out of your mouth.\u201d He took her cold hands in his and rubbed her knuckles. \u201cI was stone cold sober that night. First time in years. Unfortunately, my sobriety didn\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>She shifted in her chair. \u201cI told you I\u2019d never done that before. Right before you, um... Oh, you know!\u201d Her cheeks heated and she hated it. Hated how he made her feel like a child while he was some worldly man. Which he was, but she wasn\u2019t an ing\u00e9nue.</p><p>He lifted her hands to his lips. The soft stubble above his full upper lip tickled her skin. \u201cI wish I could go back and do things differently.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy, so you can tell me that you never would have slept with me if you\u2019d known, or you would have brought your A Game?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI always bring my A Game, no matter what.\u201d He looked so outraged she believed him.</p><p>\u201cGet to your point,\u201d she said, ready for this mockery of a waiting game to be over. Ready for him to say that putting up with her, her family and her life wasn\u2019t worth the headache she\u2019d tried to so hard to give him.</p><p>\u201cFrom now on, you have to be completely honest with me. No more playing games, no more shagging me silly so you don\u2019t have to talk to me.\u201d His forehead wrinkled as he grimaced. \u201cI take that one back. You may shag me silly any time you like, but\u2014and it pains me greatly to say this\u2014sex isn\u2019t enough.\u201d He tapped her head. \u201cI want what\u2019s hiding in there. I want your wit. I want your thoughts. I want you to put me in my place when I need it. Deflate my enormous ego when it can\u2019t fit through the front door. I want all of you, not parts and pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t give you that?\u201d Her fear of being rejected her a third time almost too much to live with each day.</p><p>\u201cYou can. It\u2019s a matter of choice, and to show you how much I trust and respect you, there\u2019s something you have to know. Two things, actually.\u201d</p><p>She braced for the worst, fully expecting to find out that he had been with someone else during their separation. Or that he had a love child hidden away somewhere. Good Lord, she was losing her mind.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember those pictures I told you about?\u201d</p><p>Clutching the arms of her desk chair tight, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone viral, but the media is speculating on whether it\u2019s me or Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach twisted. For him. For her.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t find out about them until after I\u2019d gotten here. Two days after getting here to be exact. It\u2019s very important to me that you to know with absolute certainty that I didn\u2019t come here looking for you to save my career or my chances with B.T.S.\u201d</p><p>She unglued her tongue from the top of her mouth. His statement would be so easy to verify, but if she was going to trust him, she would have to take him at his word. \u201cWhat was the second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSasha was the reason, well part of the reason, why we never connected that day. The complete asshole to a fan\u2014all my doing. I took out my frustrations on you. Not excusing my behavior, but Jaylen had shown up and I was anxious to get rid of her before you got there. It didn\u2019t help that you were late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d She pulled away and brushed a strand of hair away from her face.</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart. Sasha told me that he paid the hairdresser to take his time and somehow managed to block your calls. Or re-route them.\u201d He rose to his feet and offered her his hand. \u201cI was waiting for you. Only you. I\u2019d been waiting for you to come back to me since, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Amber, not me.\u201d Hard to believe she could be jealous of herself.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want the woman sitting in front of me, not the girl from my memories. Come to bed with me.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, but his hand remained in its place, outstretched and waiting for hers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meant to be together, love. No matter what side of the ocean we\u2019re on or how my father plots to keep us apart. Take a chance on loving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had me at \u2018Watch it, Miss Wood Sprite\u2019.\u201d She took his hand, letting him lead her to the bedroom.</p><p>She kissed him as soon as they entered the room, her lips missing their mark when he held her away. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to spend some time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does kissing not equal that?\u201d she asked, nibbling at the base of his neck. A low groan escaped his lips and she smiled. \u201cGive in to me.\u201d</p><p>He turned from her, grabbing something off of her dresser before facing her again. Holding up her new iPad, he tilted from side to side. \u201c\u2018Angry Birds\u2019, anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She jumped on the bed and fell back against the pillows.</p><p>\u201cAre you pouting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>She glared at him, then sighed. \u201cWe need snacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back with sustenance.\u201d He returned in less than five minutes with a tray of goodies and joined her on the bed. \u201cYou know, this reminds me of our tenth date.\u201d Christian popped a grape into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMy very own personal aloe spreader,\u201d she laughed. \u201cEvery woman\u2019s dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know I always wanted a dog? But my father never let us have one. Said we didn\u2019t have time for it. I suspect he knew animals hated him. He had a stallion named Diablo and the damn thing was mean as hell. Vlad was the only one who could ride him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tried anyway, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroke my arm in two places.\u201d He pointed out two spots on his left arm. \u201cHad to learn to do everything with my right hand. Guess that\u2019s why I\u2019m ambidextrous. Still favor the left though.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in air through her teeth. \u201cThat had to hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was worth it. All things worth having are,\u201d he said, making her aware of how close he\u2019d scooted to her.</p><p>\u201cJenny Barnes runs the animal shelter out on Highway 64 and she\u2019s always looking for prospective parents. We could go check it out sometime, but I think we should start with a plant,\u201d she said without thinking and his smile became brilliant. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He tapped her nose. \u201cYou said we.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at their game. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not here because your dad has made me forbidden fruit?\u201d The words slipped out before she could contain them. She cringed, waiting for his answer.</p><p>He lifted her chin to meet his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s a fair question given the dynamic of our relationship. But no, I\u2019m not here because of him. I\u2019m here because I want to be with you. Because I love you and if I have to remind you of it a million times a day, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabriel and I said that to each other all of the time. I thought I meant it, but I\u2019ve come to realize just how precious those words can be. I don\u2019t want you to just say them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sexy word-woman will forever be all about action, eh?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as he followed the curves of her lips with his fingertip.</p><p>\u201cGive me a second.\u201d He left the bed and disappeared into their closet. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready to tell me that you love me and want me to stay, wear this,\u201d he said, emerging with her ring sparkling in his hands. Opening the jewelry box on her dresser, he placed it inside. \u201cThe ball\u2019s in your court, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She held out her arms to him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He gently covered her mouth with his own, pulling her to him. She heard the iPad crash to the floor as she rolled under him. His hands fisted in her hair. She clutched at his broad shoulders. Helping him take off shirt, she couldn\u2019t stop kissing him. His chest. His throat. His ears. Which she had to nibble on, because it made him groan and grow harder between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cYou are an enchantress,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd you are my fantasy,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>He stripped away her pajamas and threw them across the room. Skin on skin met and slid together. His muscled, lean body meeting hers as they took turns being on top, under and finally, Christian laying on his side behind her, his arms around her body and holding her close as he filled her with deep-seated thrusts. \u201cWiden your thighs, love.\u201d</p><p>She draped a leg over his and he pressed deeper. She tried bearing back against him but it was of no use, he refused to go any faster.</p><p>\u201cGive me more,\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He pressed open-mouth kisses along her neck and cupped her breasts. \u201cI want to take my time loving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me forever.\u201d The words were straight from her heart.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not long enough,\u201d he said, his hips tilting up and making her moan.</p><p>She loved the feel of his thighs against her, the way the muscles of his arms bunched under her cheek when he moved. His scent stole over her, arousing her further, but no matter how much she wiggled against him he wouldn\u2019t increase the steady rhythm he\u2019d set.</p><p>One of his hands trailed down to the juncture between her thighs, his fingers parting and finding where she throbbed the most with ease. \u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he murmured. She did and he laced her fingers with his. \u201cThis is what you should do when I can\u2019t be with you.\u201d He took her fingers and used them to brush at her damp folds.</p><p>\u201cOh my God...that feels so...\u201d Her words escaped in a rush of air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as though she\u2019d never done this before, but him watching and stroking along with her, made her entire body come alive. \u201cIs that something you like for a woman to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s what you do, so I like it.\u201d He pressed their fingers firmly against her, and she trembled. \u201cI like, no, love that, too. I love your sweet moans, the way your eyes darken when you find your release and the decadent curves of your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should be the writer,\u201d she laughed, then moaned again when he began to thrust faster.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m content being your lover,\u201d he said, his voice sinfully wicked. He quit flexing his hips, holding himself completely still inside of her.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you stop?\u201d Frustrated once more, she tried to take matters into her own hands and switch their positions, but his arms tightened around her like bands of steel.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want your complete attention. With you trapped, you can\u2019t run away from me.\u201d His lips brush the base of her neck and the back of her head. \u201cWhy me, love? Why did you choose to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your kiss. The one at New Year\u2019s. I\u2019d never been kissed like that in my life. And it was like the Fourth of July. Like seeing the ocean for the first time. Like the first submersion in hot bath water. All of that rolled into one kiss.\u201d Despite being firmly impaled by his arousal, she felt a certain bitter-sweetness steal over her. \u201cThe second time, when we danced, it was like we fit together so perfectly. I couldn\u2019t deny my feelings. Which at the time I thought were borderline crazy. Who falls in love at first sight, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He brushed the side of her face with his fingers, turning her to face him. \u201cMe.\u201d His smile was tender, the look in his eyes adoring before he closed them and pressed his lips, feathery light, over hers. \u201cYou were my dream come true. An angel sent to me. Completely mine and mine alone. I remember every touch, every sigh, the feel of your soft hands as they clutched at my arms. The way your back arched when I first thrust into you. Your perfect breasts and delectable nipples. Jesus, Zoe, you brought me to my knees that night. I worshiped you. You were my personal goddess. Every woman has been weighed and measured against you. They all fell short. Again and Again.\u201d He searched her face, his expression intense. \u201cAnd now...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she asked in a whisper. She didn\u2019t trust herself to speak any louder.</p><p>\u201cI love you. In whatever disguise you come to me, I love you. Whatever name you choose, I love you,\u201d he repeated and his erotic assault began anew.</p><p>He flexed his hips faster and she buried her face in his arm. His movements were almost to the point of pounding inside of her. Her body tightened and strained for the climax just out of her reach.</p> <p>\u201cNow come for me, Zoe,\u201d he said. \u201cShow me with your body how much you love me, even if you can\u2019t say the words.\u201d</p><p>She did. Again and again.</p><p>After showing the contractor around the second floor of her house, Zoe headed out to the small balcony at the back. Feeling rather like Juliet, she leaned over the side and stared at her husband. His golden hair gleamed in the sun and his smile lit up the cloudless day.</p><p>\u201cRomeo, Romeo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her Romeo worked alongside a landscaping crew as they expanded flowerbeds and added her favorite ornamental trees. He stopped long enough to have a few words with the contractor before the man left for the day.</p> <p>Christian turned and shielded his eyes from the sun. He grinned at her, broke off a large snowball of a blossom and bounded toward her. \u201cMy Juliet. I would deny my father and be your sworn love,\u201d he shouted and tossed the purple flower up in the air.</p><p>Catching it, she lifted the soft petals to her nose and breathed deeply. \u201cThen I\u2019m no longer a Capulet. I am,\u201d she paused and stared down into his blue eyes. \u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared and she heard the screen door slam, his feet upon her stairs and she laughed with joy. She ran to meet him, colliding in the hall and they fell to the floor in a tangle of arms and clothes. And laughter.</p><p>\u201cHappy to see your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d she asked between kisses. \u201cI had to wait ten whole seconds for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be prompt from now on.\u201d His hand slid up her thigh. Her soft skin was silk and he was hard as steel.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d she whispered as his mouth found hers.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Five</p><p>For a man who was used to not getting home until dawn and then sleeping the night off, mornings were quickly becoming Christian\u2019s favorite time of day. Presently, he was tangled up in Zoe. His thigh wedged between hers, her arm under his neck and his around the sweet curves of her waist.</p><p>Placing soft kisses along her neck, he worked his way up to the rim of her ear and gently bit down. She practically purred in response and rubbed her bare breasts against his chest, her tight nipples scorching his skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be late, sweetheart.\u201d He tightened his arms around her for a moment, then skimmed the sides of her body.</p><p>She sighed lustily. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He found her lips, her kisses drugging, addicting. Just like the first time. Just like every time. He wedged his thigh deeper, spreading her legs. They fell open. Moisture from her damp curls seeped into the skin of his thigh. \u201cYou\u2019re wet for me.\u201d</p><p>Her hand glided down to his groin, wrapping her fingers around the base of his cock and stroking. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p> <p>His cell rang, playing a specific ringtone, and he groaned. He had to answer this call. Reluctantly, he reached for it and said by way of apology, \u201cIt\u2019s Martha. She\u2019s threatened to cut me off if I don\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, she\u2019s all bark and no bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because she likes you,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t cause her problems. Just make her money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting in the shower.\u201d She slid from the bed and walked to the bathroom, casting a heavy-lidded look in his direction. \u201cYou can join me when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>His cock twitched in response. Oh, he\u2019d be there all right. He managed to press the talk button before the call went to voice mail. \u201cGood morning, most brilliant of agents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to use your timely reunion with my niece to your advantage?\u201d Martha\u2019s gravelly voice came in loud and clear over the phone.</p><p>\u201cJesus, first Sasha and now you. Let me make this clear for all parties involved: I am not and will not use Zoe to advance my career or save my ass.\u201d Silence met his statement.</p><p>Then he heard Brennen shout in the background, \u201cOh, come on, Violet. Stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrennen, if I\u2019ve told you once, I\u2019ve told you a thousand times: leave Violet alone. If she wants your help, she\u2019ll ask for it,\u201d Martha shouted back.</p><p>Holy hell, had the woman finally entered the twenty-first century and gotten a phone with speaker capabilities?</p><p>\u201cBut she keeps banging on the computer screen,\u201d Brennen complained.</p><p>\u201cI was pretending it was you,\u201d came Violet\u2019s saccharine reply.</p><p>\u201cReady and willing, lass,\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, I\u2019m not running a daytime soap\u2014or a daycare,\u201d Martha groused. He heard a door slam. \u201cNow back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for remembering I\u2019m here.\u201d He flicked his eyes to the bathroom door. The shower was running and he could only imagine what his wife looked like with water glistening all over her curvy little body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to like what I have to say. It won\u2019t be pretty,\u201d Martha said.</p><p>He exhaled as a knot formed in his gut. \u201cIt never is.\u201d</p><p>Zoe found Christian in bed with his hands behind his head as he stared at the ceiling, seemingly deep in thought. His golden chest gleamed in the morning sun, the rose tattoo a delicate contrast to the lean musculature of his body. He was almost too pretty, too beautiful for a man, and at times it made her completely self-conscious.</p><p>She rummaged through her dresser, searching for panties and a bra.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d came Christian\u2019s voice, low and sinful in the otherwise silent room.</p><p>After slipping on a pair of panties, she turned to face him. \u201cI-I,\u201d she stuttered, watching as he drew the covers down his body and peered through his gold tipped lashes at her. Pale blue eyes darkened and her heart did a summersault in her chest. He was hard and ready for her.</p><p>\u201cCome here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll be late,\u201d she protested weakly.</p><p>He threw his legs over the side of the bed. She backed against the wall, sliding along it as he advanced.</p><p>\u201cI have other plans for you.\u201d His gait was smooth. Lean hips rolling and thighs flexing in tandem.</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cYou already had your chance.\u201d</p><p>She turned to run from him, but he caught her by the elbow. \u201cDo you want me to chase you?\u201d His grip tightened, then let her go. \u201cRun, but be prepared for when I catch you.\u201d</p><p>She gave a little laugh, but when she looked up at him, his face was dark, dangerous. Almost the same as when he found out about her lying to him. \u201cIs there something wrong?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a small nod. \u201cOnly you can fix it. Me.\u201d</p><p>She laid her hand on his chest. His heart beat wildly beneath her fingertips. \u201cYou\u2019re not broken,\u201d she said firmly. What he needed was for someone to love him without conditions. Without throwing his past in his face. Or his bad decisions. The ring he placed in her jewelry box seemed to call to her. But it wasn\u2019t time. Not yet. Not before she gave him one of his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been dropped from your film, from every ad campaign and endorsement, and I\u2019ve been asked to sever all ties with B.T.S. To say it was a rumor that I would be in the fall PSA\u2019s. I was also outed as their anonymous donor. They don\u2019t want my money anymore either. For all intents and purposes, I am persona non grata. Not that I can blame them.\u201d His eyes dropped to the floor.</p><p>Zoe brushed back a lock of golden hair that had fallen over his brow. \u201cBut you\u2019re their biggest donor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m their biggest liability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not right.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>His features smoothed out and it felt as if a great energy had left the room. His body. \u201cGo to your dance class, love. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, class can wait.\u201d She grabbed his hand and led him back to their bed. She gestured for him to get in and climbed in after him. Wrapping her arms around him, she pulled him to her and stroked his hair. \u201cEverything will be okay.\u201d How her heart ached for him. She knew his career didn\u2019t matter to him as much as working with B.T.S.</p><p>He let out a harsh laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s not, love. Almost everything I care about has been taken from me and I can\u2019t do a damn thing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered, tightening her arms around him. She could only imagine how he must be feeling. Everything he\u2019d worked so incredibly hard for gone in a matter of the twenty minutes it\u2019d taken her to shower. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this\u2014together. Come what may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d he said, his voice raw.</p><p>She shook her head, her eyes filling with tears for him. For his lack of confidence the world never saw or even imagined. For every mean thing his father had said or done to him. For his estranged relationship with his brother. For the mother that had deserted him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting out of my contract with Peak. If they don\u2019t want you, then I don\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cHold me instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never let you go,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Six</p><p>Leaving the antique store on Broad Street, Christian turned the package over and read the description on the back before righting it again. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you found them,\u201d he said, awestruck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you like them.\u201d Zoe gave him a big grin. \u201cOne of Mr. Nesbit\u2019s contacts had it in his store in Manteo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take to find them?\u201d The PEZ Elvises tilted to one side. When she didn\u2019t immediately answer, he stopped walking and grabbed her shoulder. \u201cI have to know, love. I\u2019ve looked for these for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost three weeks,\u201d she said, quickly looking down.</p><p>\u201cBut that would mean you\u2019d asked him right after I got here.\u201d</p><p>A telltale blush stained her cheeks. \u201cI called him after agreeing to your challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are incredibly sweet,\u201d he said, dropping his hands. No one had ever given him a present like this. Not since his mother had started his collection and obsession with his first one. Christian rubbed the back of his head and winced.</p><p>\u201cStill hurts?\u201d she asked, pressing a quick kiss to his cheek. \u201cI\u2019d hoped the Elvis surprise would help with the pain. Not that I\u2019d planned for you to be in pain after coming to my dance lessons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve a bloody knot. Who would\u2019ve thought an eighty year old woman could have such a wicked curveball?\u201d he mused. \u201cAnd with a fuzzy slipper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Florence didn\u2019t mean to hit you. She wanted to dance with a stud-muffin,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cShe was all hands. I felt like a piece of meat.\u201d He shuddered, making her laugh until they came face to face with her ex. \u201cGabriel.\u201d Always awkward running into an ex, but this guy was harmless when it came to Zoe. Christian didn\u2019t get the I-want-my-woman-back vibe from him.</p><p>\u201cChristian.\u201d He gave them both a tight smile. \u201cZoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Gabe,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>Gabriel rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spy on you or do a tell-all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you?\u201d she asked, her brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve been asked,\u201d Christian said, his suspicions confirmed. Call him a cynic but there were very few people in this world that would turn down millions of dollars for a few minutes of \u201cwork\u201d.</p><p>Gabriel nodded once. \u201cI can\u2019t be bought.\u201d</p><p>Score one for the good guys left in the world.</p><p>She gave Christian a wide-eyed look. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they\u2019d bother anyone else.\u201d</p><p>At that moment he felt ancient. \u201cLove, they\u2019d bother your grandmother on her deathbed.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel shifted from side to side, his gaze to the street closet to them, Ivy Lane. \u201cThought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Christian meant it and maybe if he hadn\u2019t been so in love with the woman at his side, or less selfish, he would tell her that she deserved a man like Gabriel.</p><p>Gabriel ambled away.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with him,\u201d Zoe said as they walked to her car. \u201cBefore you came back, he wanted my advice on something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen him like this once or twice before and each time it seemed to have something to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about his problems. All I care about is you\u201d Christian crushed her to him, kissing the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m sure Gabriel can figure out everything on his own.\u201d He opened her door.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re right,\u201d she said, then slid in the passenger seat.</p><p>He closed the door behind her and jogged around to the driver\u2019s side. Once inside, he closed his door and buckled his seatbelt. \u201cI have to go to Paris tomorrow. It\u2019s been months in the making. A stag party for a certain ginger-haired prince.\u201d The Camaro\u2019s engine revved and he made a U-Turn in the street.</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cPrince Ha-\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, not that one, but there\u2019s every possibility you\u2019ll eventually have to attend something with him there. My mother\u2019s a Lady and my father claims the whole Romanov Prince bit. He even bought an English title and all its entailments.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does that make you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Second son, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying that.\u201d</p> <p>He shifted into fifth gear and covered her hand with his. \u201cAlmost forgot your penchant for the runts of the litter.\u201d</p><p>He heard her snort. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing little about you. Then again I don\u2019t have anything to compare it to, so I might be a wee bit biased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour compliments leave much to be desired.\u201d He gave her a sidelong glance. She was biting her lower lip and trying not to laugh. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll have to be at the airport no later than two am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d she asked, her voice a bit thin to his ears.</p><p>All things considered, his wife was taking the news rather well. \u201cFive days, but if I can leave earlier, I will.\u201d</p> <p>She snatched her hand away. \u201cThe bachelor party is for almost a week?\u201d</p><p>Okay, so she wasn\u2019t taking it well at all. \u201cIt\u2019s rather touchy when one deals with Royalty. They\u2019re quite moody and love ceremony. Bloody, boring ceremony.\u201d He turned off the car and turned to face her, mentally willing her to understand. To have faith in him.</p><p>\u201cAnd a \u2018round the world menu of women on hand helps pass the time. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll cater to your every need so you won\u2019t be bloody bored.\u201d She got out of the car and ran inside of their house.</p><p>He found her in her hiding place or as she liked to call it\u2014her office. She was standing in front of the new shelves that had been recently installed and staring at them.</p><p>She\u2019d already filled the new space up with more books, more crystal fairies\u2014he\u2019d tucked in a pirate PEZ dispenser in the middle to balance things out\u2014and framed pictures. That was his favorite addition. All the photos of Zoe and him. It made him feel like he belonged. This house felt more like home to him than any place he\u2019d ever lived before, but he suspected it had more to do with its owner than the actual structure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that,\u201d he began, then stopped. It sure as hell was like that and his wife wasn\u2019t an idiot, nor did she deserve to be treated like one. \u201cI know how to say no.\u201d He knew that he could say no a thousand times to any woman, but Zoe.</p> <p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d she said softly, turning to face him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for snapping at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have sprung it on you like this, but in all honesty, I didn\u2019t want anything interrupting our time together. Actually, I thought that by ignoring it, I could get out of it.\u201d He leaned against her desk and crossed his arms. \u201cI got a text from Sasha during your dance class and it quickly dispelled any notions of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a great big family affair. Even my father\u2019s invited.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a face. \u201cSounds great.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou\u2019d never make it as an actress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t you just say you\u2019re sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no. Look, I\u2019m going to have security flown in. Today reminded me of just how persistent the paparazzi can be.\u201d It was true. Being in Holland Springs had lulled him. Another surprise as he\u2019d always been the one looking for the next party. The next adrenaline rush. The next high. He\u2019d never been content to stay in one place. Not until Zoe.</p> <p>The sound of a car pulling up in the drive way had him walking over to the window and peering out. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He watched his cousin jog up the front porch steps. Turning to his attention back to his wife, he said, \u201cI think Sasha\u2019s here to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t help the position he\u2019s in.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fluttered in the air. \u201cI know, but all I can think of is I had to go almost five years without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou loved me all that time?\u201d</p><p>She ducked her head. \u201cI\u2019m not an obsessed fangirl. Just don\u2019t go looking on my hard drive. I might have sneaked a peek at you some time or another.\u201d</p><p>He crooked his finger under chin, lifting it. \u201cI might have stared at the pictures of you from that night a time or two myself.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rounded. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Sasha knocked on the front door, but he ignored him. \u201cI\u2019m only going to say this once, but the girl that captivated me turned into the woman that captured my heart. However, if you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll wear it proudly on my sleeve for all to see.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a shy smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not your heart you\u2019re wearing, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God, you two, stop with the talking,\u201d Sasha grumbled, appearing in Zoe\u2019s office without being invited in the house.</p><p>\u201cHave I ever told you, Sasha, that your timing sucks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStealing my line, are you?\u201d Christian asked.</p><p>She lifted a shoulder. \u201cI tweaked it a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, dear, but I need your man,\u201d Sasha chimed in.</p><p>\u201cGet one of your own.\u201d</p><p>Sasha scrubbed his hand across his face, drawing attention to a cut on his swollen bottom lip. Who\u2019d ever popped his cousin in the mouth had a hell of a punch. \u201cI like women. All shapes, sizes and races. Twenty-one and up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, you\u2019re like the UN of dating. Must be nice to have a choice or the chance to be with whomever you want,\u201d she said, her hands clenching into fists.</p><p>Christian stepped in between them. He was half-tempted to let Zoe throw a punch at Sasha. \u201cCalm down, wildcat. I roughed him up good before I came out here.\u201d</p><p>She blinked up at him. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe damned near drowned me-to say nothing of what he did to my hair,\u201d Sasha said with a slight grimace.</p><p>Christian eyed him in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019d just woken up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy almost drowning me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit being a pus\u2014\" Christian remembered that his wife was standing there. \u201cPansy.\u201d</p><p>Sasha laughed at him. \u201cGot you by the short-hairs, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he has manners. Ever heard of them?\u201d Zoe fisted her hands on her hips.</p><p>It was times like this that he couldn\u2019t possibly love her more, but he did. Her defense of him was amazingly sweet. And completely undeserved.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here, Alexander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Vlad,\u201d Sasha said and Christian flipped him off, manners be damned. \u201cI texted you the wrong time and date. We have to leave at three. This afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell am I supposed to give my wife a proper good bye with only,\u201d Christian glanced at his watch, \u201cthirty minutes warning?\u201d</p><p>Sasha rubbed his chin. \u201cWell, you could start by not talking so damn much and getting right to it.\u201d Sasha made a motion with his hand and hips.</p><p>Christian pointed a finger at him. \u201cGo wait in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, your highness. Whatever you say, your highness.\u201d Sasha gave them a proper bow and sauntered off, whistling as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s lost his mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think his idea has merit,\u201d Christian said and lifted her in his arms. He made it to their room in record time and threw her on the bed, joining her as he worked at the buttons of her shirt, but to his surprise she pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cWait, you\u2019ll make me forget,\u201d she said, scooting out from under him.</p><p>He rolled to his side and propped a hand up under his head.</p><p>She searched through her top drawer. \u201cI was going to wait to give this to you, but now it seems like the right moment.\u201d She whirled around, her orange pleated skirt flaring out as she did. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He did but not before he saw a small box in her hands.</p><p>The bed dipped slightly under her weight and she kneed him in the stomach. \u201cWhoops, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d A swift kiss to his belly had him reaching for her and she tumbled on top of him with a laugh. \u201cOpen your eyes.\u201d</p><p>The box had been replaced with a man\u2019s ring. The same one he\u2019d given her almost five years ago. She\u2019d kept it?</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I had our initials engraved on the inside. This ring deserves a second chance. Just like us.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, unable to get out any words as she slipped the ring on his finger.</p><p>Her smile became uncertain and a worried frown replaced it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to wear it, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cOkay, so I lied. I really, really want you to wear this. I want everyone to see that you belong to me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cutting her off with a kiss, he proceeded to show her exactly who he belonged to.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Seven</p><p>Melanie leaned back on the wood and glass counter, giving Zoe a mischievous smile. \u201cHow are things going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Zoe said, paying for their desserts. Wasn\u2019t that the understatement of the year?</p><p>\u201cYou have a hot person of the male kind sleeping with you every night and it\u2019s only fine?\u201d Melanie took a sip of her milkshake and followed Zoe out to the sidewalk.</p><p>The spring weather made the day sunny and warm. Residents of Holland Springs shopped in the bustling downtown, waving and nodding as they passed one another.</p><p>Zoe tilted her head to the side and nibbled on her bottom lip. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s more than fine. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d actually still be here, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man doesn\u2019t show up to eat crow without a very good reason. Christian could be with anyone in the entire world, but he\u2019s here. With you. Just in case you weren\u2019t sure,\u201d Melanie pointed out. \u201cEven if he\u2019s at a bachelor party in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave more self-confidence in yourself and give him a little credit.\u201d</p><p>Zoe chewed on her straw. \u201cI gave him the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know you\u2019re wearing his?\u201d Melanie asked.</p><p>Glancing at her hand, Zoe wished she\u2019d actually had the nerve to put the antique ring on before he\u2019d left. But coward that she was, she waited until that night and didn\u2019t even show to him when they had talked over Skype. \u201cNo, I want to surprise him with it when he gets back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s official, he can stay?\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Zoe looked at her best friend and gave her a big smile. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Melanie squeezed her tight. \u201cYou won\u2019t be sorry, Z. Not this time. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>They walked down Broad Street\u2019s sidewalk and took a left onto Ivy Lane. Carolina Dreams\u2019 familiar bright yellow door was propped open. One of the three Holland sisters stood outside, writing on a chalkboard display.</p><p>Auburn hair gleamed in the sun and Skye Holland turned, tossing Zoe and Melanie a cheerful smile. \u201cI have your belly butter ready, Melanie.\u201d Skye motioned for them to follow her inside.</p><p>\u201cDid you know I have to hide it from Carter?\u201d Melanie asked as she waddled to the back of the store.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like you using the sisters\u2019 concoctions?\u201d Zoe frowned at her retreating form.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, he loves it,\u201d Melanie said, handing her credit card to Skye. \u201cSo much that he eats it out of the jar.\u201d</p><p>Zoe smothered a giggle.</p><p>Skye\u2019s eyes danced with mirth. \u201cIt\u2019s completely safe for humans and animals.\u201d She held the glass jar up to the light. \u201cAll natural, homegrown ingredients. And we recycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taken him, Zoe?\u201d Rose Holland asked, appearing beside her sister and making Zoe start. With long, curly black hair and fair skin, Rose had always reminded Zoe of Snow White. But if one listened to the town gossip, the Holland sisters were more like the witch. Only without the poisoned apples.</p><p>Melanie snorted. \u201cI know she\u2019s taken him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet your mind out of the gutter.\u201d Zoe lightly tapped her sister-in-law on the arm. \u201cShe\u2019s talking about the springs.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s brown eyes widened. \u201cOooh, I can\u2019t wait to see how that turns out. Carter and I had amazing sex there. Mind-blowing, make you want to slap his momma sex.\u201d</p><p>Zoe made puking motions with her hands and mouth. She so did not want to hear about her sister-in-law and her brother.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to know, Zoe, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll find your answers.\u201d Rose tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a legend,\u201d Zoe said. \u201cBesides, I already know he loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you and Gabriel ever find it?\u201d Skye asked, handing Melanie a receipt.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She had thought Gabriel would have loved to go hiking through the woods, looking for an elusive pool of water that the town was named after. Instead, he\u2019d complained the entire time and after an hour of searching, Zoe had given up. They\u2019d been right out of college, before they\u2019d broken up for the second time and she had moved to California.</p><p>Rose\u2019s ocean-blue eyes held a look of pity. \u201cThat\u2019s not why you didn\u2019t find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what I did wrong,\u201d Zoe snapped, then she sighed and laid a hand on Rose\u2019s arm. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid,\u201d Skye chimed in and looked at her older sister.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a little,\u201d Zoe admitted.</p><p>Rose\u2019s hand covered Zoe\u2019s. \u201cThe path to true love is never easy. Nothing worth having ever is. And remember, Summer and I never told you to go looking for it with Gabriel.\u201d</p><p>Melanie nodded in agreement. \u201cYou know what they say: no guts, no glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Zoe threw her free hand up in the air, smacking a wind chime and making it play discordant notes. \u201cOh, crap. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rose\u2019s eyes cut to the chimes. The tune changed, giving Zoe and judging by Melanie\u2019s loud sigh, a sense of peace.</p><p>\u201cSummer said to tell you to go the day after tomorrow,\u201d Skye said, reading from her cell phone. \u201cYou know where to start?\u201d</p><p>Zoe nodded. She knew the legend by heart. \u201cBy the intertwined dogwoods at Strawberry Grove.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has to take the lead. You have to trust him, because love is nothing without it,\u201d Rose said. She came around the counter and gave Zoe a large basket. \u201cTake this with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever he comes back, I\u2019ll take him.\u201d Zoe bounced up and down on the pads of her feet as the two Holland sisters gave her identical raised brows. \u201cI know, I know. The day after tomorrow.\u201d Zoe glanced at her sister-in-law. \u201cReady to go?\u201d</p><p>Melanie shook her cup. \u201cYep, I need a re-fill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to turn into a milkshake,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>Melanie shrugged. \u201cYou just wait until you\u2019re pregnant. Then we\u2019ll see what you crave. Fish and chips, maybe? Or spotted dick?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, good Lord, Melanie. I don\u2019t know how Carter puts up with you,\u201d Zoe said with a laugh.</p><p>Paparazzi ambushed them as they walked out of the Hollands\u2019 store. Reporters peppered her with questions and shoved pictures of Christian in her face. Ignoring the group, she propelled Melanie back inside and locked the door behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Melanie asked, her hand placed protectively over her belly.</p><p>\u201cAsshats of the major kind,\u201d Zoe said.</p><p>After thirty minutes all but one had left. She scowled at him. He was the same reporter who\u2019d said she dated all the guys who\u2019d auditioned for her movies. Slimeball. He plopped his skinny butt down on the bench outside and pulled out a sandwich, tearing at it with uneven teeth.</p><p>\u201cGross.\u201d Melanie\u2019s face turned an alarming shade of green.</p> <p>He chewed with his mouth open. Whole globs of what looked like chicken salad splattered his stained t-shirt.</p><p>Skye and Rose joined them at the front of the store.</p><p>\u201cWe could get rid of him for you,\u201d Rose offered. The bangles on her arms clicked together as she moved an ivy plant out of their way.</p><p>Zoe eyed them, wondering if Rose could order some for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some in tomorrow. In your favorite colors,\u201d Skye said, her auburn hair swinging. She repositioned jars and bottles on display in an ancient hutch. The Holland sisters could always be counted on for three things: their potions and their love advice. The third one wasn\u2019t worth repeating. Stupid town gossips.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Zoe said, an idea coming to mind. \u201cThis is something I have to do for myself.\u201d It was risky and maybe even foolish, but dammit she wasn\u2019t going to be called a fool for love for nothing. \u201cWish me luck, y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Zoe unlocked the door and stepped outside.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Eight</p> <p>If Christian had to bow one more time while mumbling something about being honored to be there, he was going to sit his arse down in the nearest chair and remain there for the duration of his stay. Protocol be damned. His father\u2019s barely concealed looks of don\u2019t-fuck-this-up be damned as well.</p><p>\u201cAt least you haven\u2019t forgotten your manners,\u201d Vladimir said.</p><p>They strode toward the billiards room, keeping a respectable distance from the His Royal Gingerness. At least that\u2019s what Christian and Sasha called Prince Damien in private. They knew the man hated his nickname and used it at every opportunity to remark on anything remotely resembling the red shade of Damien\u2019s hair. Whoever saw and said it first, punched the other. It was a game they\u2019d played since primary school.</p><p>\u201cWould you look at that ginger vase?\u201d Christian punched his cousin in the side.</p><p>Sasha let out an omph and earned a scathing look from Vladimir.</p><p>For once Sebastian was late, but Christian knew it had to be due to some kind of perceived financial meltdown. Protocol was the air his brother breathed. Punctuality his bread and water. Romanov Industries, his mistress. A cold bed, that.</p><p>\u201cAlexander, go fetch something,\u201d Vladimir said with an edge to his voice.</p><p>\u201cA glass of port, milord?\u201d Sasha asked, sounding ridiculously subservient.</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Vladimir shouted, making the line of men in front of them pause and turn their way.</p><p>\u201cHe needs his own special rod to play with, during billiards,\u201d Christian said with unholy glee.</p><p>The Prince and his companions nodded thoughtfully and resumed their pace.</p><p>Christian cast a look his father\u2019s way. It was rare to see his father so overcome. Spittle actually gathered at the corners of his mouth, making him look like a rabid dog.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what an embarrassment you are to this family? To me? Your brother? You\u2019re the reason why Francesca left in the first place,\u201d Vladimir hissed at him.</p><p>Christian laced his hands behind his back and kept a bland expression. \u201cNo, she found you having sex with her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had bothered to inform me of Francesca\u2019s early return, she\u2019d never have found out,\u201d Vladimir said, his indignation palatable.</p><p>\u201cI was twelve. Surely, you could found a better look-out than a pre-adolescent boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame tune, different day,\u201d said a familiar voice.</p><p>Christian whirled around and made a face, his sharp retort gone. \u201cWho the hell helped you dress?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian glanced down at his suit, smoothing an invisible wrinkle. \u201cAlexander had it sent over. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you looked in the mirror? At us? Bloody hell, man,\u201d Christian said and gestured to his clothing.</p><p>The look on Sebastian\u2019s face could only be described as incredulous. \u201cHe\u2019s dressed us like we\u2019re still in short pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking like me does have its benefits,\u201d Christian smirked.</p><p>\u201cWould you shut your vulgar mouth, Christian?\u201d Vladimir growled as he turned around. \u201cGood God, who\u2019s who?\u201d</p><p>Christian turned to his brother and raised his brows. Sebastian\u2019s eyes flashed with humor. Though it had been years since they\u2019d last pulled this of prank and the consequences had been more than painful, they gave their father the same grin.</p><p>\u201cYou tell us,\u201d they said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing this stupid game. One of you change.\u201d Vladimir stalked off.</p><p>Sebastian shoved his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels. \u201cAll he had to do was look at our hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmiring my new hardware, were you?\u201d Christian wriggled his fingers. \u201cSorry, you\u2019ll have to get your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m not getting married until I\u2019m at least thirty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it in your business contract with Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it in yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d Christian inclined his head. \u201cShall we continue to torture him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis head\u2019s likely to explode,\u201d Sebastian said.</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that different from any other day I\u2019m around?\u201d</p><p>Sebastian raised a brow. \u201cBut you get to leave. I\u2019ll go change.\u201d</p><p>Before his brother could leave, their father came storming back and grabbed both of them by the arm. \u201cI actually don\u2019t give a damn which one of you is which, but by God one of you will tell me who the low-class chit belongs to.\u201d</p><p>The image paused on the giant flat screen confirmed his worst fear: Zoe being harassed by paparazzi. Someone pressed rewind, then play on the DVR. His wife\u2019s beautiful face lit up the room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have sisters? Or a mother? How would you like it if someone was being ugly to them?\u201d One small hand fisted on her hip, her finger nearly poking the man\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cBeing ugly?\u201d Sebastian muttered.</p><p>Christian shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to teach her better insults, but hadn\u2019t had the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady, I\u2019d sell my grandma out if she was doing an A-Lister accused of snorting coke.\u201d</p><p>Her lips thinned. Holy hell, she was going to let Ed Willis have it. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Christian groaned. Couldn\u2019t she have, at the very least, called him an asshat? Something, anything had to be better than goading the man.</p><p>The rail thin reporter stepped closer. \u201cIs this your husband in these pictures? Are there some of you that will surface next? Do you have a drug problem, Mrs. Romanov? Is that the real reason you\u2019re trying to protect him.\u201d He leered at her and Christian clenched his hands into his fists, ready to do major violence. \u201cHow much is your silence worth?\u201d</p><p>She backed away, her face growing pale.</p><p>Christian looked at his father. \u201cShe\u2019s a problem?\" He snatched the remote and turned up the volume, his heart pounding so loudly in his chest that he could barely hear himself think.</p><p>Mistaking Christian\u2019s question for agreement, Vladimir loosened his tie. \u201cWait for it, Sebastian. Your brother\u2019s outdone himself with this one. Perhaps I should have you marry the Von Lichtenstein girl instead of Princess Mary-Margret Helene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry the Princess? You can\u2019t mean it. After all I\u2019ve done for you. For our family.\u201d Sebastian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he flushed along the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019ve done?\u201d their father said, seemingly uncaring of their audience. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019ve been good for is keeping our name in the news. If it weren\u2019t for me, this family\u2019s finances would have disappeared long ago.\u201d</p><p>Christian tried to keep track of both conversations, but his wife was his top priority. Come this evening, he was leaving. He didn\u2019t care if he became persona non grata in this world either. He mentally commanded Zoe to leave as well, but she didn\u2019t.</p><p>The reporter advanced, backing her against Carolina Dreams\u2019 yellow front door. \u201cIan Romanov has left you again, and this isn\u2019t the first time. It\u2019s not even the second.\u201d</p><p>Pretty green eyes became like DVDs.</p><p>Christian\u2019s jaw started to tick and he spared his father a glance. It had been rather convenient that the press showed up just as he left, and that his father just happened to turn the television to the right channel.</p><p>\u201cHe used you, tracked you down and used you again. Face it, sweetheart, you picked a worthless piece of\u2014\u201d The last word was bleeped out but he and everyone else knew what the reporter had called him.</p><p>\u201cMy sentiments exactly,\u201d Vladimir said.</p><p>Suddenly, Zoe got right in Willis\u2019 face. She held up one finger and shouted, \u201cThis is what I think of him.\u201d She looked straight into the camera and held it closer, making Christian\u2019s mouth drop open. \u201cAs for you,\u201d she said to the reporter who was now standing off screen. \u201cBless your heart!\u201d Then she flipped her hair over her shoulder and walked away, the muffled sound of bells ringing from the hem of her skirt. She was magnificent.</p><p>\u201cNot only is she shouting her location to everyone, but she used the wrong finger,\u201d Sasha drawled. \u201cHowever, her exit was glorious.\u201d</p><p>Christian made to leave, trying to contain the euphoria building inside of him, threatening to go off like a nuclear explosion. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me,\u201d he said with a downward tilt of his head toward the Prince.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go so soon, Sebastian, I have some phone calls you need to make,\u201d Vladimir said to Christian with an approving pat on the back. \u201cI know you\u2019re not exactly on board with forming an alliance with the Princess, but her holdings are key to our expansion into\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Those pictures are of me, Sebastian Romanov, not my brother. All further questions can be fielded through my lawyers.\u201d Christian heard his brother say, making their father pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stunt are you trying to pull, Christian? Is it not enough you\u2019ve besmirched your own name?\u201d Vladimir said. \u201cI wish to God I\u2019d sent you off to live with Francesca when she begged and pleaded for her boys.\u201d</p><p>Sebastian pulled his arm back and let it fly, hitting Vladimir square in the face. He went down like a ton of bricks. \u201cI\u2019m Sebastian, you blind son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you? You\u2019re the son I love.\u201d Vladimir moaned, holding his jaw.</p><p>\u201cYou only love yourself.\u201d Sebastian leaned down to hit him again, but Christian pulled him back.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not worth it.\u201d Christian said flatly. \u201cOr I\u2019d have done it years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bloody tired of doing your bidding. And I\u2019m sure as hell not marrying a woman twenty years older with a face like welder\u2019s bench and twenty mutts constantly yapping in my ear.\u201d He smoothed the fabric of his jacket and ran his fingers through his hair, looking more and more like the in-control brother Christian was used to seeing.</p><p>\u201cWell done, Bastian, well done,\u201d Christian said, using the childhood nickname he\u2019d given his brother.</p><p>His pale blue eyes bore into Christian\u2019s. \u201cGo home to your wife and have a dozen babies. Be happy. Just don\u2019t expect me to be a part of your life. I\u2019m done with this poor excuse of a family.\u201d Sebastian started to stride away.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that. Well, he had the punch coming, but not the other,\u201d Christian said his voice thick with emotion.</p><p>Sebastian turned and gave him a sad smile. \u201cI am the elder brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy four minutes, Sebastian. By four damn minutes,\u201d Christian reminded his twin.</p><p>\u201cAbout time the two of you made up.\u201d Sasha\u2019s moss green eyes were mocking.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Alexander, I think it\u2019s time you took care of Vladimir,\u201d Sebastian said after a moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sasha eyed the man sprawled on the marble floor. Vladimir yelled for a bag of ice. \u201cWhile I think it\u2019s time for me to take a bloody holiday.\u201d</p><p>The last person Zoe expected to see sitting in her living room was her mother-in-law. Well, with the way the woman sat, it was more like holding court. Zoe had the absurd notion to curtsy, but instead she gave Lady Francesca a small smile. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you. Even if you broke into my house to do it.\u201d Okay, so maybe that wasn\u2019t the best way to start off, but the woman was waiting for her. She hadn\u2019t been invited.</p><p>Zoe eyed the two men standing guard in her foyer. They each had an earpiece and wore sunglasses like a character straight of The Matrix or in the Mafia. She wasn\u2019t sure which was worse. Or scarier.</p> <p>Cornflower blue eyes raked her up and down, making Zoe wish she had on something different. Something without coins on the hem and not the bright shade of lime sherbet ice cream.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not what I expected.\u201d Her voice was soft, modulated and very proper. Francesca Romanov dressed every inch the lady she was, making Zoe feel like what the cat dragged in.</p><p>Zoe picked at a sequin on her skirt. Two of the coins clinked together and her mother-in-law\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely. Is that by Garvene?\u201d</p><p>Who? \u201cIt\u2019s by Target,\u201d Zoe said, giving the \u201cget\u201d syllable the faux-French treatment.</p> <p>A manicured hand patted pale blonde hair. \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t heard of him. Is that a new designer?\u201d</p><p>Zoe felt a sudden need to giggle. She wasn\u2019t sure if the woman was making fun of her, or if this was like the time Christian told her he didn\u2019t know what Cracker Barrel was. She hoped it was the latter, since she didn\u2019t have any desire to be ticked off at his mom. Well, no more than she was already.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s an American designer,\u201d she said, then changed the subject. \u201cChristian isn\u2019t here. He\u2019s at a bachelor party for Prince\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamien,\u201d Francesca said with a small nod. \u201cYes, I know where my sons are, but I came here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Zoe sat down on the couch beside her and pulled a pillow into her lap. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to make sure Christian is happy and that the woman he picked to marry wasn\u2019t, well, like me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no comparison between the two of us,\u201d Zoe said, concentrating on the thread work on the decorative pillow.</p><p>Startled by the cool hand placed over hers, Zoe looked up at her mother-in-law.</p><p>\u201cChristian\u2019s always had a mind of his own and when he wants something, there\u2019s no turning back. He\u2019s was that way as a child. So determined, yet so caring.\u201d Francesca\u2019s face softened. \u201cDid you know he used to compose a song for me every Mother\u2019s Day?\u201d</p><p>How could this woman have given up her children? \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t talk about that or you.\u201d</p><p>A small laugh escaped Francesca. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine he does. You have to understand. I\u2019m not allowed to have contact with him or Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Zoe asked. \u201cYou\u2019re their mother and still married to their dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, we\u2019re separated, but if I don\u2019t want the money to stop, then I can\u2019t have any contact. However, Vladimir said nothing about seeing you.\u201d Francesca looked very pleased at the notion of having outwitted her husband.</p><p>Anger rose inside of her chest, hot and fast. Was there no one in his family that loved him unconditionally? \u201cYou choose money over your children?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnlike you, darling, I have no career skills. Oh, I can paint a lovely watercolor and even sing, but other than that I\u2019m purely ornamental.\u201d Francesca drew her hand back. \u201cIt was what I went to finishing school for. To be a rich man\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? This is the twenty-first century. Women don\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What do you suppose Princess Catherine learned to do all that time Prince William was courting her? Or when they were planning the wedding of the century? Expanding her horizons? Buckling down on a career path?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey both went to St. Andrews and graduated together,\u201d Zoe pointed out.</p><p>Francesca rose to her feet in one graceful moment. \u201cPlease tell Christian that I love and wish him the best.\u201d She glided to the front door, pausing. \u201cTake better care of him than I did. Perhaps when children come you\u2019ll send me photos? I\u2019ve left my card on the mantle, between the coyote and the wood sprite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll invite you to every birthday party and holiday,\u201d Zoe said with a graciousness she didn\u2019t remotely feel. The faster this woman left her house, the better.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll politely decline, darling.\u201d Another pause. \u201cBut do send them anyway.\u201d Francesca sailed out of Zoe\u2019s house and into the white Mercedes parked in the driveway.</p><p>Feeling very thankful for the parents she had, Zoe picked up the phone and called them.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Nine</p><p>Last night as Zoe talked to Christian, she\u2019d been relieved when he hadn\u2019t mentioned her run-in with the paparazzi. He\u2019d sounded tired and their phone call hadn\u2019t last that long at all. She was so ready for him to come home. According to the Holland sisters he would be here today, but he would have told her if he\u2019d planned on cutting his trip short.</p><p>With a sigh, she began typing her next chapter.</p><p>Someone pounded on her door.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d she yelled.</p><p>The pounding grew louder and longer.</p><p>Clicking on save, she rose from her desk with a huff. \u201cHold your horses.\u201d Jogging to her little foyer, she opened the door and frowned. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that wasn\u2019t the dumbest thing I\u2019d ever seen on T.V., I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d Luke said to Zoe.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you need to watch your own show, Dr. LA. You\u2019re in Miami.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna let me in or what?\u201d he asked. Actually, it sounded more like a demand to her.</p><p>She pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes, giving him her best don\u2019t-mess-with-your-big-sister look. \u201cDepends on how civil you can be.\u201d</p><p>His dark brown eyes narrowed, then his face softened and he turned back into the brother she loved. \u201cSorry, Zoe. I want you to be happy, but I can\u2019t stand him. He humiliated you in front of millions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that skanky asshat of a reporter did that. You heard what was later reported. Those pictures were of Sebastian, his identical twin. You of all people should be able to understand how twins can be mistaken for the other.\u201d</p><p>He glanced away, shaking his head. \u201cYeah, I know it. And I know that what looks like a duck, walks like a duck and does drugs is your sham of a husband\u2019s brother trying to cover for him.\u201d</p><p>Even though she knew the truth about the pictures, she wasn\u2019t about to share it with Luke. And she didn\u2019t know what had persuaded Sebastian to take the fall for her \u201csham\u201d of a husband. But she was tired of their families making the man she loved into something he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying married, and one day, I\u2019ll have mini-Christians running all over the place. Are you going to refuse to be in your someday niece or nephew\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know just how to go for the gut, don\u2019t you?\u201d Luke asked.</p><p>\u201cLook, as much as I love you, as much as I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re here with nothing but my best interest at heart, there\u2019s nothing you can do or say to change me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t come around until you\u2019re ready to support my decision. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done for you, even when I knew you were wrong.\u201d Pushing the door completely shut, Zoe stared at it and nodded her head once.</p><p>She looked at the clock and began pacing. After thirty minutes of drawing a circle with her footprints around the couch, she decided to go to her office to finish writing the chapter she\u2019d been working on before Luke\u2019s interruption.</p><p>Smiling at the pictures that greeted her, she reached out to caress the closest black and white print. She scrunched her forehead, then looked at the other pictures for confirmation and gasped.</p><p>They were all the same. Okay, so not exactly identical, but in almost every one, her husband was looking at her. She took one down and held it close. The expression on his face took her breath away.</p><p>That settled it. They would go looking for the real Holland Springs. No matter the outcome, her feelings would stay the same. She loved him. Deeply, madly and truly. She didn\u2019t care about his past, only their future. Together.</p><p>A noise coming from the front of the house jolted her out of her thoughts. She frowned, thinking that Luke had decided to really press her buttons.</p><p>Stomping to the foyer, she yanked the door open. \u201cI thought I told you to\u2014Christian!\u201d She jumped in his arms, nearly knocking him over. Covering his face with kisses, she held on to him as he walked inside. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI.\u201d Kiss. \u201cMissed.\u201d Kiss. \u201cYou.\u201d Kiss. \u201cToo.\u201d Christian put her down, cupping her beautiful face in his hands. This was the homecoming he had never realized he\u2019d been missing. God, it felt good.</p><p>Her pretty eyes crinkled at the corner before she hugged him again. \u201cDid you see me on television?\u201d</p><p>Pulling away, he gave her a disapproving frown. \u201cYour behavior, Ms. Ambrose, was very improper. I\u2019m not sure if a right proper gent like myself can be seen with such a scandalous woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she laughed. \u201cAnd it\u2019s officially Mrs. Romanov now. I\u2019ve got the papers to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou changed your last name?\u201d He almost dropped to his knees. She was willingly taking on a name that he didn\u2019t know for how long would cause doors to slam against her. Them.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip and nodded. \u201cI wanted to surprise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see that ring, Mrs. Romanov.\u201d He smiled and let her go, closing the door behind him. Then he dropped his bag onto the floor.</p><p>She wiggled her fingers at him, her laughter contagious. \u201cHow does it look?\u201d</p><p>Taking her hand, he rubbed the antique ring. It was finally back where it belonged. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he said and kissed her again, drinking in her happiness.</p><p>When they broke apart, she led him over to the sofa and sat down in his lap. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d be upset with me for speaking to that scummy reporter because I know you told me: \u2018Do not to engage the enemy\u2019, but I was sick and tired of everyone putting you down. Plus, he sat there the longest and Melanie was about to puke from watching him eat.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head at her version of humor, he held her hand while stroking the center of her palm. \u201cActually, I was angrier at the insults he tossed your way. It won\u2019t be the last time someone does that or blogs about me, or you, but I\u2019m too damn selfish to let you go.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him. \u201cThis is where I belong.\u201d Pulling away, she laid her hand on the side of his face. Her dark eyes solemn. \u201cI need you, Christian. Your smile, your laughter, your love, the way you tuck your PEZ dispensers in with my fairies. I trust you to stay. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this is where I\u2019m supposed to say something meaningful and emotional, but all I want to do is show you my appreciation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy man of action.\u201d Her smile was like a siren\u2019s, stealing the air from his lungs.</p><p>Christian cupped her breasts, filling his hands with their heavy weight. He rubbed his thumbs over her fabric covered nipples and was rewarded with a hitch of her breath. Her eyes closed as her head fell back, dark hair cascading over her shoulders. \u201cI have many, many things planned for you, Mrs. Romanov.\u201d He inched her shirt up. \u201cThings so depraved that you won\u2019t be able to look at me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>She growled. \u201cWe are so getting rid of that thing.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to throw something at the damn thing first. Most likely it was her mother with some kind of casserole or her father \u201cchecking\u201d on the progress the crew Christian had hired to finish the renovations of her house had made. Zoe\u2019s family was nosy as hell, and he wouldn\u2019t have them any other way. They genuinely cared about her and her happiness.</p><p>\u201cWe know you\u2019re in there, Romanov. Open the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Luke.\u201d She let out a groan, scrambling from his lap. \u201cLet me handle this.\u201d She answered the door and all of her family came pouring in. Brothers, sister, sister-in-law and parents.</p><p>Good God, they had seen the video of Zoe and the reporter and were here to kill him.</p><p>\u201cPrince Ian,\u201d SmithAnn squealed, running over and plopping down in his lap. He gave her a little hug and moved her over so that he wouldn\u2019t be speaking two octaves higher than usual.</p><p>Lawton placed his hand on Luke\u2019s shoulder and pushed him forward. \u201cGo on, speaker elect.\u201d</p><p>Luke gave his father an annoyed look before facing Christian and Zoe again. \u201cWe\u2019re here to tell you that we support Zoe\u2019s decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouder, son,\u201d Lawton said.</p><p>\u201cWe support Zoe\u2019s decision and want to welcome you the family.\u201d</p><p>Christian suppressed the urge to laugh, mostly because he thought Luke might have a scalpel hidden on him. He set his niece to the side and rose to his feet, offering his brother-in-law his hand. \u201cI appreciate it. Immensely.\u201d When Luke took his hand and didn\u2019t rip it off, a collective sigh left the group.</p><p>Evangeline cheered and SmithAnn danced around him.</p><p>Heath presented him with a knit scarf and hat. \u201cThe color really pops against a black or grey coat,\u201d he said, then smirked. \u201cI call the pattern Ball and Chain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leah rose on her toes and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, rubbing off her lipstick stain with a spit dampened thumb. \u201cWell, sugar, I guess you\u2019ll do. Maybe I\u2019ll get some dark headed grandbabies out of the two of you.\u201d</p><p>His wife blushed. \u201cCan we be married for a while first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do our best.\u201d Christian smirked at Luke. \u201cGive it the all-American try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone tell me why we\u2019re not kicking his ass?\u201d Luke asked, his voice rough.</p><p>As the rest of her family offered their support and presents, he watched Zoe as she talked to Melanie. Their conversation ended with Zoe shaking her head and grabbing a large picnic basket.</p><p>Suddenly, Melanie let out a groan and grabbed her huge belly.</p><p>Everyone rushed to her side.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs the baby coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s gas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she can\u2019t stand the thought of Romanov being a part of the family.\u201d</p><p>Zoe shooed them away. \u201cI think Melanie needs to go to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Luke raised his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s already a doctor in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe means a real doctor, not a guy who plays one on T.V.,\u201d Logan said.</p> <p>Carter shoved everyone out of his way and helped Melanie walk to the door. \u201cZoe, watch SmithAnn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Melanie shouted and everyone stopped to look at her. \u201cI want Zoe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take SmithAnn,\u201d Leah said, taking her grand-daughter\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go Christian,\u201d Zoe said, tugging him after the couple heading to their minivan.</p><p>Christian dragged his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t think she wants me, love. And I\u2019m sure as hell not ready to be in the room with her.\u201d</p><p>Zoe gave him an exasperated look. \u201cI\u2019m bringing you to keep Carter company. He\u2019ll be nervous.\u201d She set the basket in the van and climbed in.</p><p>Christian climbed in after her, entirely confused. Why would Carter need him of all people? This was Melanie and Carter\u2019s second child. Something was not as it seemed, but he got in anyway.</p><p>After about five miles, Melanie yelled for her husband to stop and he hit the brakes. Christian glanced at his wife, but she was busy giving her sister-in-law a hug. The door slid open and she got out, grabbing the basket and motioning him to follow.</p> <p>With a mischievous grin, Melanie waved at them. The minivan took off.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me what madness has taken over or is this your way of saying you\u2019d like to have a picnic?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI had to get us out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have asked everyone to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were planning on staying for dinner,\u201d she said, walking to the edge of the forest, then back to him. \u201cI want to take you some place special.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows. \u201cThe legendary springs?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and set off in the opposite direction. \u201cBut I can\u2019t find the dumb trees. They\u2019re entwined dogwoods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean these?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>Christian waited by the slender-branched trees, showy pink blossoms falling as the wind gently blew.</p><p>\u201cYou found them,\u201d she said, running to him.</p><p>Taking the basket from her, he grabbed her hand and kissed the palm. \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere you go, I\u2019ll follow,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>\u201cTogether.\u201d He brushed past the trees and went left.</p><p>She followed him, deeper and deeper into the forest, until time seemed to stand still and not even the sun dared to set. A great hush descended, as if even the trees and animals were holding their breath in anticipation.</p><p>The sound of water rushing over rocks sang in her ears. He abruptly turned right and stopped. A blanket of ivy hanging from branches above seemed to part in front of them, like a giant curtain on opening night. Her eyes grew round and her heart tripled its beat. She placed a hand on her chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe we found\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Garden of Eden,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Leafy plants, orchids, roses and a multitude of flowers that she had no name for grew together as no plants of the tropical and evergreen variety should. But there they were, cohabiting in harmony. Butterflies fluttered and dragonflies zoomed. A tall waterfall tumbled over rocks and splashed down into a crystal clear pool of water.</p><p>The real Holland Springs.</p><p>Hands clasped tight, they walked through the parted ivy and up to the pool of water.</p><p>Standing at the edge, she looked down, relieved to see nothing but a sandy bottom even as her palms grew damp in anticipation. She licked her lips, unable to say anything.</p><p>He clasped her waist and slowly turned her to face him. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Christian,\u201d she said simply. No embellishment needed.</p><p>\u201cThose are the most beautiful words I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d he whispered before his mouth came down on hers. A kiss of fulfilled promises and a future together. A kiss that mended even the smallest pieces of her broken heart.</p><p>Reluctantly, she pulled away and began to unbutton her shirt. He watched her, his face intense as she removed her clothes. His clothes quickly joined hers. She couldn\u2019t help but admire him. The way his lean body gleamed in the sun. The rose tattoo on his muscular chest. The way his strong thighs gave way to muscular calves. Even his feet and hands were perfection.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she whispered, reaching out to touch him.</p><p>He sucked in his stomach when her fingers caressed him and she gave a low laugh. But it was short lived as his erection stood hard and thick between them. He gave her a wicked smile and wrapped his hand around it, slowly working it up and down its considerably length.</p><p>\u201cDo you think this is beautiful as well?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth became dry as the Sahara while the Amazon ran between her thighs. She tried swallowing, but was unsuccessful until he turned away and dove into the pool of water. She watched his body in motion, gliding through the depths until he broke the surface and shook out his hair.</p><p>\u201cGet in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too deep,\u201d she said when her mouth returned to normal.</p><p>He swam her way and held out his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she jumped in. Water surrounded her, but instead of the shock of cold, the water was perfect. Tiny bubbles tickled and caressed her skin. She was hauled to the surface, making full contact with his hard body. She tangled her fingers in his hair and brought his face down to hers.</p><p>Their lips danced, their tongues mated. She wrapped her legs around his waist. He moved them, until the waterfall splashed down on their heads and shoulders. She threw back her head and laughed, feeling free and joyous.</p><p>A slight move to the right and her back bumped up against the mossy side. His erection brushed her thigh and she twisted to bring him inside of her, but he stopped her. He lifted her high in the air, his hot mouth opening over her nipple and tugging deeply.</p><p>She moaned low in her throat, letting him lower her to the edge and push her down. Soft grass tickled her back. Her thighs fell apart. He bent his head, the soft touch of his scalding tongue seeking her most intimate of parts. He devoured her, ate and licked at her, until she trembled and cried out his name.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have protection with me,\u201d he panted, letting her go and laying his head on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThe basket,\u201d she said, running her fingers through his wet hair. \u201cI put some in the basket last night.\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself out of the water and strode to the basket. Two beats of her heart later, he was beside her. Droplets of water rained down on her skin as he covered her, his hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d He entered her, slowly. Until she was stretched and filled.</p><p>\u201cYou. The man I love.\u201d</p><p>Clasping her wrists in one hand, he stretched her arms above her head and let go. \u201cMine. Always and forever.\u201d</p><p>His thrusts started slowly, but quickly worked to a feverish pitch as he stroked her, holding her body prisoner beneath his. She grabbed his arms, holding onto him like he was her anchor in a carnal storm that raged over her.</p><p>Christian looked down on the woman under him. She was heaven and drawing this out was hell. She was his and had always been. She humbled him. She amazed him.</p><p>Zoe loved him.</p><p>He buried his face in her neck, his muscles gathering and flexing as he moved. As they came together in utter perfection. He was so close, but he had to hear her words again. \u201cTell me you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>His body jerked. \u201cTell me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. Only you. Always you.\u201d</p><p>He shouted her name as he came, his breath leaving his body in great gulps as he cradled her close to him. \u201cI love you, Zoe,\u201d he remembered saying before they drifted off to sleep.</p><p>The moon had risen high in the night sky by the time he opened his eyes, but he could see Zoe as clearly as if they were under a noon sun. She smiled sleepily at him, pulling the soft blankets he\u2019d discovered in the basket over them.</p><p>\u201cIs this a dream? Are you really an enchantress after all?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her pretty eyes soft. \u201cNo, but I promise to be the woman I should be, the woman I\u2019m meant to be, and the woman you deserve.\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded against his chest, not caring if she saw the tears in his eyes. \u201cYou already are, love. You already are.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Eight years later</p><p>Christian knelt down and looked at his five year old twins. The eldest, Jude, had dark hair like Zoe with his pale blue eyes while Waverly was all sunshine-colored hair and pretty green eyes like her mother.</p><p>\u201cNow remember, you stick up for each other. If someone teases your sister, Jude, you defend her, and, Waverly, if someone is mean to your brother, you defend him.\u201d</p><p>Jude nodded and shoved his hands in the pockets of his shorts. \u201cI can defend myself and Waverly.\u201d</p><p>Waverly shook her head, making the large green bow in her hair wobble. \u201cMummy said we\u2019re to tell our teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, quite right. Well, Mummy does know best.\u201d Christian tapped his forehead. \u201cShe\u2019s got loads of brains. Luckily, you two take after her.\u201d</p><p>The bell rang.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for them to go inside,\u201d Zoe said, her soft drawl and calm manner easing his anxiousness. She gave their children a big grin. \u201cY\u2019all have my old Kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Phelps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we homeschool? Perhaps a private tutor?\u201d Christian stood.</p><p>\u201cBut we want to go to school. Please, daddy?\u201d his children simultaneously protested.</p><p>\u201cPlease, daddy?\u201d Zoe mimicked with a saucy wink directed his way.</p><p>Christian capitulated, taking Waverly\u2019s hand while Zoe took Jude\u2019s. \u201cOkay, but just for this year.\u201d</p><p>The trio cheered.</p><p>After walking them to their classroom, he gave his wife a sidelong glance.</p><p>\u201cReady for some alone time, Mrs. Romanov?\u201d After eight years of marriage and two children, she looked as beautiful as the day he\u2019d met her. More so with baby number three on the way. Their little \u2018whoops\u2019 as he liked to call the baby girl.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better enjoy it while we can,\u201d she said, lacing her fingers through his. \u201cPlus we need to pick out a name.\u201d</p><p>He brought her hand to his lips for a fleeting kiss. \u201cI\u2019m still not entirely convinced you named the boy after me.\u201d</p><p>Zoe shook her head. Sometimes she still couldn\u2019t believe he was hers. Such a family man. He pinched her bottom. And as wicked as ever.</p><p>She smacked his hand. \u201cYour middle name is Jude,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cHave you taken a look at your laptop\u2019s history files lately? All I\u2019ve seen is Jude Law\u2019s digital images. A less confident man would be suffering right about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for my next novel. You\u2019re not jealous, are you?\u201d she teased. \u201cHe is staring in the movie you\u2019re financing and agreed to headline a benefit for B.T.S.\u201d Christian headed the board for the organization. They\u2019d had a change of heart, issuing a statement that in effect said that even adults deserved second chances. He\u2019d stepped up and had taken over, establishing the charity in several foreign countries. He\u2019d begun taking parts again, in films that spoke to his heart and won critical acclaim.</p><p>\u201cYou completely fangirled Jude when he said hello while we were on holiday in Majorca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who got to go back to our penthouse and have bubble bath fun with me?\u201d</p><p>He pointed at his chest.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you play your cards right, I\u2019ll let you do it again before I get too big to fit in there with you.\u201d</p><p>He scooped her up in his arms and she squealed. \u201cI\u2019ll just have a larger tub installed, with winches if need be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t say that to a pregnant lady.\u201d</p><p>They drew smiles and curious stares while he carried her to their SUV.</p><p>\u201cWhat should one say?\u201d Love was bright in his blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you. What else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Then she kissed him. </p> </body></html>"]
