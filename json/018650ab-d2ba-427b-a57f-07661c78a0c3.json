This whole thing was starting to feel like a bad idea. Perhaps I should never have driven all the way out here.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" he asked, kissing my neck and guiding me backwards towards the kitchen table.</p><p>\"It's the dog,\" I whispered, lying down and screwing my eyes shut, trying to block out the sound of it in the distance.</p><p>\"Just ignore it and relax,\" he hushed, his whiskey breath hot against my neck.</p> <p>\"Perhaps your dad is on his way back - that's why the dog's...\" I started and opened my eyes again, looking up into his face.</p><p>\"He won't be back for hours,\" he murmured, unbuttoning my work shirt, the faintest of smiles tugging at the corners of his mouth, eyes half-shut like two crescent moons.</p><p>With one hand placed on the back of his thick neck, I eased myself up onto the table, wondering now if this wasn't all a big mistake - one which I would later regret. I'd pulled a lot of crazy stunts in the past, but nothing like this - not on duty. But hey, I was just twenty, and entitled to a little bit of fun now and then. I knew, though, that was me talking and not my dad - my sergeant - who was hoping that I would've said goodbye to my wild ways once I had joined the police force. I had only joined to make him happy - to get rid of that disapproving look he had in his eyes for me ever since I had turned thirteen. I was twenty now - so he kept reminding me. Time to grow up and take some responsibility.</p><p>With the dog howling like a wolf on the other side of the farm, Michael pulled open my shirt, bent forward, and started to kiss my nipples, through the thin lacy fabric of my bra.</p><p>\"Officer, I need to be punished,\" he groaned.</p> <p>Officer? I rolled my eyes. He really was getting a kick out of me being a cop. I glanced to the left, down at the stone kitchen floor where some of my uniform now lay. My utility belt with the cuffs, baton, CS spray still attached and my police radio, which hissed and crackled as if searching for a signal. I needed to keep it close - listen for any urgent calls. What with the dog howling and the radio hissing and spitting, how was I ever going to relax enough to enjoy Michael? It was no good and I just couldn't cross that line of no return and fully let go. As Michael trailed a soft, wet line of kisses over my breasts and down the flat of stomach, I reached forward, fumbled for his trouser belt, then let go.</p><p>\"Don't stop,\" he breathed, pushing himself against my thigh. I could tell that he was excited and having no problem in giving in to the moment.</p><p>\"I can't,\" I breathed, my heart starting to race - not with excitement, but fear. What if a call should come in now, a call for urgent assistance from one of my colleagues? I was miles from town. Could my radio even get a signal this far out? It had the other day, hadn't it? I tried to remember. Even though Michael was smothering me in kisses and now trying to tug my trousers free, this whole thing didn't seem like a good idea anymore.</p><p>I'd known Michael had wanted me from the moment I had arrived at his father's farmhouse three days ago. The call had come in from Control as an attempted burglary, but it wasn't. After arriving and being met at the gate by the farmer, he led me around the side of the house and towards a dilapidated barn. It had been raining all that morning, and as I'd traipsed behind the broad-shouldered farmer, mud and animal shit had splattered over my boots and up my trousers. It had stunk.</p><p>The farmer seemed undeterred by the driving rain and mud, and stopped before the rickety barn, with rain falling over his bald head, down the length of his weather-worn face, and through the thick blond hairs which covered his meaty forearms.</p><p>\"Take a look at this,\" he said, rattling a broken padlock and chain with one huge hand.</p> <p>Take a look at what? I felt like asking upon seeing the rusty, broken lock. It was so old it could have fallen to pieces of its own accord for all I knew or cared.</p><p>\"Thieves, that's what they are,\" the farmer said, looking at me through the rain.</p><p>\"Who are?\" I asked, just wanting to be back in my patrol car and out of the cold.</p><p>\"Whoever smashed this here lock and got into my barn,\" he huffed at me, like I was some kind of freaking retard.</p><p>I knew what he was thinking. Why had they sent a woman to do a man's job?</p><p>\"Has anything been stolen?\" I said, pushing open the door and peering into the barn. It was dark inside, and just like outside, it smelt of shit. I took my torch from my belt and flashed a wide beam of light around the inside of the barn. There didn't appear to be anything of great value - not to me, anyhow. It looked cluttered with nothing more than a bunch of rusty-looking crap like old tractor parts, tired-looking pieces of machinery, scattered bales of hay, and more animal shit.</p><p>\"Nothing's been stolen as far I can tell,\" the farmer said, stepping into the barn behind me. \"But that's not the point. If it hadn't had been for Jess scaring the thieving bastards away, they could've done more damage than just the broken lock.\"</p><p>\"Jess?\" I said, cocking an eyebrow at him, and fixing my torch back on my belt.</p> <p>\"My German Shepard,\" he said gruffly, taking me by the elbow and leading me from the barn. \"The dog scared 'em off, she did.\" The farmer pulled the barn door closed behind us, then added, \"I reckon it's that vermin.\"</p><p>\"What vermin?\" I asked, pulling the collar of my raincoat up about my throat, and tugging the peak of my cap over the bridge of my nose. Rain dripped off it in thick rivulets.</p><p>\"Those travellers who have taken over old Farmer Moore's house,\" he said, his voice almost dropping to a whisper. \"Nothing like this ever happened 'til they moved in.\"</p><p>\"As far as I know, that family keeps themselves to themselves and doesn't cause anyone any bother,\" I told him.</p><p>\"They ain't like any family I've ever seen before,\" the farmer grunted, setting off back towards the house. \"They look like a goddamn bunch of witches.\"</p><p>\"Witches?\" I called after him, splashing through the rain-soaked ground. I secretly thought the name described the family quite well. I had never had any dealings with them and had only seen them from afar. They rarely ventured into the town of Cliff View, but when they did appear, all huddled together in the back of the horse-drawn cart, their complete black attire did, I guess, give them the appearance of a coven of witches. As far as I could tell or had seen, the family was led by an elderly, wizened-looking guy. There was a younger couple, maybe in their late thirties or early forties, but their faces were so pale and drawn-looking, it was hard to tell. There was a younger kid, about four or five years old - but again, it was difficult to tell, and if the truth be known, I didn't really give a shit. The family, however odd as they might have looked, kept to themselves and had never given me or my colleagues any reason to speak with them. There hadn't been an increase in reported crime since their arrival on the outskirts of town a few months back. Most of the burglaries, car thefts and shoplifting were the work of those shit-heads, the Day brothers, who lived on the estate on the other side of Cliff View. I had been a cop for less than twelve months, and already I had arrested both of those pimply-faced arseholes more times than I cared to remember. If the farmer's barn had been broken into - it was more than likely to be the handiwork of the Day brothers than the family of witches who had recently moved into the area.</p><p>At the kitchen door, the farmer kicked the mud from his boots and stepped inside. I scraped the soles of my boots against a broken piece of paving outside the kitchen door, shook the rain from my coat, and followed him into a cosy-looking kitchen. A wide, wooden table surrounded by uncomfortable-looking chairs filled most of the small room. The floor was made of a grey stone, and around the edges of the kitchen were an array of cupboards, shelves, and a stove. The room looked cluttered with junk, just like the barn had.</p><p>\"Take a seat,\" the farmer said, scooping up an armful of cups and plates from the table. He dropped them into the nearby sink, came back, and took away a pile of old newspapers. \"Tea?\" he asked, switching on the kettle.</p><p>\"No thanks,\" I said, taking my cap from my head. \"I should really be getting back to the station.\" I didn't want to be off duty late, as I had plans to go clubbing with my friends.</p><p>\"What about my barn door? Are you gonna go and arrest those witches?\" he huffed.</p><p>\"I won't be arresting anyone right now,\" I told him. \"You don't know who broke your lock and neither do I just yet.\" Taking my pocket notebook out, I flipped it open. \"Let me take some details.\"</p><p>\"Details?\" the farmer asked, turning to face me with a disgruntled stare.</p><p>\"I'll need to report the criminal damage so you can get a crime number to pass onto your insurance...\" I started.</p><p>\"I haven't got time to sit here all day talking to you,\" he said, rubbing his huge, dirty hands together. \"I've got work to do.\"</p><p>What I suspected he really meant to say was, he was too freaking dumb to read or write.</p><p>\"If you don't want to report it then that's fine,\" I said, pushing back from the table.</p><p>\"Sit back down,\" the farmer grunted, flapping one of his giant hands at me. In a deep, booming voice, which seemed to rattle the windows in their frames, he shouted, \"Michael! Michael! Come and speak with this police officer, will you?\"</p><p>From deep within the farmhouse, I heard the sound of heavy footfalls descending from above. I looked back at the door to see a guy of about thirty enter the kitchen. This guy was stocky, with a well-built body. I could have practically climbed the humpty-bumps of his six-pack, which were plainly visible beneath the tight white T-Shirt he was wearing. I didn't know what relation he was to the farmer, but knowing my luck, it was probably his younger gay lover.</p><p>\"This here is my son,\" the farmer said. \"He'll tell you everything you need to know.\"</p><p>I looked at the farmer then back at his son. Other than the muscular forearms, there was no other similarity, thank Christ. Unlike the other guys I had fooled about with in the past, Michael was older and had an air of confidence - maturity - which the others hadn't always had. He had unruly, curly black hair, which draped across his brow and around his neck like a bunch of springs. He was unshaven, but not so much that he had a beard - just a shadow of black bristles - and I couldn't help but get a tingling sensation as I quickly imagined what they would feel like against my skin. His eyes were a pale green, and his complexion was bright and ruddy, I guessed due to all the hours spent working the fields in bad weather. He wore a pair of scruffy jeans, and his feet were bare. He knew I was looking at him with more than a casual stare. I looked away, not before I saw his eyes twinkle mischievously back at me.</p><p>\"Officer,\" he said, coming towards me, holding out his hand.</p><p>\"Constable Sydney Hart,\" I smiled back at him.</p><p>He shook my hand, his fingers strong and rough as they enclosed around my fist. At first I wasn't sure if it was my imagination, but Michael held my hand just a fraction longer than perhaps was necessary.</p><p>\"Constable,\" he smiled, releasing my hand. \"Pleased to meet you.\"</p><p>\"She needs a statement or summin',\" the farmer cut in. \"I don't have the time. If I'd known calling you out was going to cause so much trouble, I wouldn't 'ave bothered.\"</p><p>\"It's no trouble,\" I said, looking back at him, and as I turned my head, I could see that his son was now studying me. It was like his eyes were boring through my uniform, as if I were standing in the dimly-lit kitchen naked. It didn't make me feel uncomfortable - I was used to it. With my blond hair, full lips, and petite figure, I had grown used to men staring googly-eyed at me, or practically tripping over their tongues as they turned their heads to take a second look. It was just men - it's what they did. Since joining the police force, I had only to turn up at a drunken stag night to have groups of pissed-up men holding out their wrists and begging me to arrest them. The only date I would've given them was with the custody officer when they sobered up the following morning.</p><p>Turning to look at the farmer, I said, \"It's just that I have to take a few details so I can file a report...\"</p><p>\"Well, my son can tell you all you need to know,\" he moaned, heading towards the back door and pulling it open. \"It was Michael who found the busted lock.\" Then he was gone, heading back out across the fields to do whatever it was he so urgently needed to attend to. I kind of got the impression that if I had been up for storming over to the witches' place, as he had called them, he would've taken a little more interest in the crime reporting process. But as there obviously wasn't going to be any lynch mob forming today, the farmer had lost interest.</p><p>\"Take no notice of my father,\" Michael suddenly said. \"He can be a miserable old sod at times.\"</p><p>I turned around to discover Michael had moved from the kitchen door and was now leaning back against the sink, his thick arms folded across his chest.</p><p>\"Aren't you a little bit young?\" he said.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I quizzed him.</p><p>\"To be a copper, I mean,\" he half-smiled.</p><p>I couldn't be sure if he was being patronizing, teasing me, or just flirting.</p><p>\"I'm old enough,\" I said with a stare.</p><p>\"For what?\" he grinned.</p><p>\"For all sorts of things,\" I smiled back.</p><p>There was a pause as we eyed each other across the kitchen. Feeling uncomfortable for the first time since I had laid eyes on Michael, I took out my pocket notebook, and said, \"If you just tell me what happened, I can write up my notes.\"</p><p>\"So how old are you?\" he asked, ignoring my question, not wanting to leave the previous topic.</p><p>\"Twenty,\" I said, my eyes still fixed on my notebook.</p><p>\"Legal then?\" he pushed, and I knew even without looking up at him that he was smiling.</p><p>\"Legal for what?\" I played along.</p><p>\"To handle a weapon,\" he laughed.</p><p>\"I don't carry a gun,\" I said, looking up at him, to see a boyish grin stretched across his face.</p><p>\"That's not what I meant,\" he said.</p><p>\"Are you always like this?\" I smiled, closing my notebook.</p><p>\"Like what?\" he said, unfolding his arms and stepping away from the sink and coming across the kitchen towards me.</p><p>I looked back down at my notebook, my heart speeding up and mouth turning dust-dry. I didn't usually feel like this in the presence of a guy. It was me who usually shot back the cute one-liners as I stood before them, brimming with a confidence that most considered to be bordering on arrogance. So to claw back some ground, and not wishing to come across like some inexperienced schoolgirl, I said, \"Why are you being so full on?\"</p><p>\"I'm just being friendly - that's all,\" he shrugged just inches from me.</p><p>I reopened my notebook wrote his name, my usually neat handwriting looking now like a spidery scrawl.</p><p>\"Do you want my number to go with that?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I think I've got your number,\" I said with a wry smile.</p><p>\"What else would you like to know about me?\" he said, taking another step closer.</p><p>Michael came to stand behind me, but just an inch too close. From where he stood, I could smell the shower gel he'd used on his body and the shampoo he had washed through his untidy hair. My heart started to race faster, and I knew I needed to take back some ground - after all, I was the one in authority here - wasn't I?</p><p>\"Please step away,\" I asked, turning to meet his stare.</p><p>\"Why?\" he said, as if completely clueless as to what he was doing.</p><p>\"Because I'm meant to be working here,\" I shot back.</p><p>With his eyes almost seeming to sparkle, he continued to stare at me for what seemed like the longest time. Slowly, Michael stepped back from me and said, \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable, officer.\"</p><p>\"That's okay,\" I murmured, feeling as if I could breathe again - as if I was back in control.</p><p>Turning to face me, he said, \"Look, I'm really busy right now...\"</p><p>\"Busy doing what?\" I sighed, just wanting to take down as much information as I could to complete the crime report back at the station.</p><p>\"Why don't you come back another time?\" Michael suggested, heading towards the back door.</p><p>\"Like when?\" I asked, knowing now for sure that he was messing with me and enjoying it. Deep inside me, there was a part that liked the fact he was doing this. It kind of turned me on.</p><p>\"How about Wednesday, officer?\" he said, opening the back door for me. \"I'm free all day.\"</p><p>I mentally scrolled through my shift pattern and knew I was on a middle shift on Wednesday - two 'til ten. \"I could make the report out right now...\" I started.</p><p>\"Wednesday will be good,\" Michael smiled back at me, the door still wide open and the sound of the rain beating against the saturated ground outside.</p><p>Raising the collar of my coat about my neck, and placing my cap on my head, I stepped out into the rain. I looked back again, but Michael had already shut the door. I hurried down the path, dodging the puddles as best I could, and climbed into my patrol car. Inside I sat and listened to the sound of the heavy rain drumming off the roof above me as it beat in time with my racing heart. I looked back at the farmhouse in the distance and pictured Michael in his spray-on tight T-shirt and scruffy jeans. With that picture of him at the forefront of my mind, I started the engine and drove the patrol car down the lane. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course I went back to the farmhouse on the Wednesday - I had to. Since meeting Michael, I hadn't been able to get him out of my head. I had never met a guy so in my face before. At first I wondered if I hadn't imagined how he had come on to me; had I read too much into the situation? I knew I hadn't. Michael had flirted with me - he had made it so obvious that he liked me, and I liked him, too. To be honest, since leaving the farmhouse on that bleak afternoon, I had been unable to stop wondering what it would feel like to have those short, sharp bristles and rough hands all over me.</p><p>That very afternoon, after getting off from work, and unable to get him out of my head and shake off those feelings of wanting Michael, I paced between the bedroom, living room, and kitchen of my poky apartment. My skin felt hot and flushed, and I had a warm, needy, sensation in the pit of my stomach. I busied myself by ransacking my wardrobe, pulling out dresses and skirts for an evening of clubbing with my friends. In the end I didn't go out, I had an early night instead, lying alone in the dark, one hand between my thighs, fantasizing about Michael.</p><p>So on Wednesday, kidding myself that I would be spending my afternoon undertaking police work, I wrote in the office diary that I was out taking statements for the rest of the shift. Even as my patrol car lurched over the uneven dirt road which led up to the farmhouse, I told myself that my afternoon would be spent in the company of the disgruntled farmer and his son, completing the paperwork necessary to file my crime report. I climbed from the car. The day was cold, but not wet, so I left my raincoat on the backseat of the car along with my cap. I made my way up to the front door, utility belt with all of its equipment swinging about my hips.</p><p>With my fist, I knocked on the door once before it swung open. Michael stood in the doorway. He wore a red checked shirt unbuttoned down the front and the same pair of faded jeans he had been wearing a few days before. Without saying anything, his eyes locked on mine. Michael stepped to one side, gesturing for me to enter. He closed the door behind me. I felt a nervous tension inside the cluttered kitchen. I turned to look at Michael. He stood with his back against the closed door, barring my exit, shirt open. I could see his well-defined stomach and chest. It looked rock hard, as if chiselled from stone. My eyes followed that sexy 'v' line that was such a turn on for me, a thin line of wispy black hair poking up from beneath the waist of his jeans. He caught me staring at him, that warm sensation spreading out from my stomach, downwards.</p> <p>Knowing the answer to my question before I even asked it, I said, \"Is your father home?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Michael said with a shake of his head, his thick black hair spilling over his brow. \"He won't be back for ages, but you knew that already, didn't you?\"</p><p>\"Did I?\" I asked back, the room suddenly feeling hot and claustrophobic.</p><p>\"Of course you did,\" he half-smiled, stepping away from the door and heading across the room. He stopped before the kitchen table, and picking up a bottle of whiskey, he poured two glasses. Michael came back across the room and offered me one of them.</p><p>\"I'm on duty,\" I told him, refusing to take the glass.</p> <p>Slowly he raised the other glass to his mouth, taking a gulp. Michael peered at me over the rim of the glass. \"Do you always play by the rules, officer?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I told him, as he continued to hold the glass of whiskey out before me.</p><p>\"That's good to know,\" he smiled wistfully at me, then emptied his glass. \"So if I were to break the law, you would have to punish me, right?\"</p><p>\"It wouldn't be down to me to punish you...\" I started as he waved the glass beneath my nose again. This time I took it and drank its contents straight down. The liquid scalded the back of my throat and I fought desperately not to cough and splutter.</p><p>\"But you would have to arrest me, right?\" he said, heading back towards the whiskey bottle. He picked it up and poured another glass almost to the brim. Sipping it, Michael headed back across the kitchen towards me.</p><p>\"Whether I arrest you or not all depends on what sort of crime you committed,\" I told him, placing my empty glass down and taking the one he had been drinking from. I gulped down the remains, and with a smile, I said, \"Why? Do you have something you want to confess?\"</p> <p>Slowly, Michael reached out and cupped one of my breasts in his large hand. I looked down as he gently brushed his thumb over my nipple. It felt good.</p><p>\"You'd have to arrest me for assaulting a police officer,\" he smiled, taking his hand away.</p><p>We stood and looked at each other in the quietness of the kitchen. The only sound was that of my racing heart.</p><p>\"Are you going to arrest me?\" Michael dared, his eyes wide with delight.</p><p>\"This is insane,\" I breathed.</p><p>\"What is?\" he whispered.</p><p>\"This,\" I said, reaching out for him and pulling him close.</p><p>Our lips met as we kissed. Michael eased his tongue into my mouth, where it slid wildly about. I kissed him back with as much passion, my own tongue darting beneath his. He buried his hands in my hair, loosening the bun I had pulled it into. Once my hair was free, he yanked and pulled at my shirt, desperate to get at what lay beneath. I ran my hands down his back, his body hard beneath my touch.</p> <p>\"I've got a good mind to take you into custody,\" I whispered in his ear.</p><p>\"Do what you like, officer,\" he said, pressing himself against me. I could feel his cock was hard beneath his jeans. He started to move his hips in a slow, deliberate, circular motion as he rubbed against me. I was tempted to unfasten his jeans and release it - take it in my hands. Before I'd had the chance, Michael was guiding me back towards the kitchen table, his rough hands now working their way down the back of my trousers and squeezing my arse. My utility belt came free, my baton, radio, and quick-cuffs clattering against the stone floor.</p><p>I looked sideways at the front door. If I was going to leave, then I had to do it now. I knew that if I stayed, there was no going back. I would've crossed a line which I might never come back from. With Michael's hands now between my legs and just wanting him, I closed my eyes on the door and on all of my reasoning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I lay on my back across the table. Michael ran the palms of his hands over my breasts, his fingers playing with the nipples. I moaned, as he lent over me letting the tip of his tongue flicker over the hollow of my belly button.</p><p>He moved lower still, and taking his hands from my breasts, he started to work my trousers down and over my thighs. I reached out, clawing my nails over his shoulders like a set of rakes. He groaned and pulled my trousers free. Michael climbed up onto the table, slowly pushing my legs apart with one knee. I buried my face into his bare shoulder, nipping at his flesh with my teeth. With one finger, he hooked aside my panties and let his fingers work slowly through the fine knot of hair between my legs.</p><p>I shuddered against him, arching my back off the table, as his fingers began to slowly, gently stroke me.</p><p>\"Is this wrong, officer?\" he whispered, glancing up at me from between my thighs.</p> <p>\"Very,\" I gasped, as his fingers quickened.</p><p>With his free hand, I watched him fumble his jeans open and let them drop to the floor. His cock stood almost upright from the middle of his body.</p><p>It was then that the dog started to howl.</p><p>Leaning back, I closed my eyes, trying to block out the sound of the dog. The noise of its barking, bringing me back to the sudden, unwelcome realisation that I was a cop who was still on duty.</p><p>I screwed my eyes shut as Michael's strokes grew faster and faster, as did my growing excitement.</p> <p>\"Do you want me to fuck you, officer?\" Michael teased.</p><p>Beginning to feel more anxious than turned on, the knowledge of where I was, what I was doing, and everything I was risking, made me freeze up and turn cold. It suddenly all felt so wrong. But wasn't that the whole point? Wasn't the fact that everything I was doing was so forbidden the reason I was so aroused in the first place?</p><p>Yap-yap-yap! The dog howled.</p><p>I tried to block out the sound of the dog by concentrating on what Michael was doing to me.</p><p>\"So, are you gonna punish me, or what?\" he whispered, reaching down and taking a condom from his jeans.</p><p>\"Stop,\" I gasped. \"I can't do this anymore.\"</p> <p>Michael glanced at me. \"Is this part of the game?\"</p><p>\"There is no game,\" I said, pushing myself up onto my elbows and closing the front of my shirt.</p><p>\"You are kidding me, right?\" he asked, sounding unsure as if I were messing with him.</p><p>\"No, I'm not kidding,\" I said, sliding from the table and snatching up my trousers. As I tugged them back over my legs, all I could see in my head was my father's disapproving glare. \"This should never have happened,\" I told Michael.</p><p>\"So you're not going to arrest me?\" he said, and I couldn't tell if he still thought all of this was some part of the fantasy we had been acting out.</p><p>\"I don't think so, do you?\" I said back. \"I've got to go.\"</p><p>Realising the game was over; he hurriedly pulled up his own jeans. \"Perhaps we could do this again sometime - you know, when you're not on duty?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I doubt you would find it as much fun,\" I said, tightening my utility belt about my waist.</p> <p>\"I guess not,\" he said thoughtfully.</p><p>I looked back at him as I fixed my police radio to my belt. Before I could say anything back, my radio made a hissing and then a crackling sound. I snatched it from my belt and held it close to the side of my face.</p><p>\"Zulu-Control to Romeo-Three...\" the voice of the operator in the control room came over the radio, then cut off.</p><p>\"What's that...\" Michael started.</p><p>\"Shhh!\" I scolded him. \"My control room is trying to get hold of me.\"</p><p>\"Zulu-Control to Romeo-Three nothing heard from Romeo-One...\" the radio operator cut in then died away again.</p><p>\"Shit!\" I barked, heading for the door.</p><p>\"What's the problem?\" Michael called after me.</p><p>\"They've been trying to raise me on the radio but because there's no bloody signal out here, they think I've had an accident or something,\" I explained. \"I need to get into an area where I can contact them before they send out the search party - if they haven't already.\"</p><p>Reaching the kitchen door, I remembered I'd put in the office diary that I was out taking statements all afternoon. I only had one outstanding crime in my tray at the moment, and that was this so-called burglary at the farm. It wouldn't take my father - Sergeant Hart - too long to figure out where I was and come in search for me - if he hadn't already.</p><p>Looking over my shoulder at Michael, I said, \"If any cops turn up here, tell them I took your statement and left about an hour ago.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" he shrugged, still looking confused at my sudden change of mind. He added, \"Will I see you again, Officer Sydney Hart?\"</p><p>\"Unbelievable,\" I sighed under my breath and left the farmhouse.</p><p>I raced down the path towards my squad car and didn't look back once. With the engine roaring, I sped away and down onto the single-lane track. I pulled my radio from my belt, scanning the signal bar. It was blank. I pushed on, taking the tight bends in the narrow country roads faster than I knew was safe. I wanted to be as far away from that farmhouse as possible before I came across my father. Taking one hand from the wheel, I cupped it around my mouth and breathed out. I sniffed my hand.</p><p>Whiskey!</p><p>How had I been so stupid? I cursed myself.</p><p>Taking my eyes off the road for just a moment, I leant forward and pulled open the glove box in search of some chewing gum. I hadn't even opened it when I felt the car lift off the road. The world seemed to spin and turn all around me. There were scraping and tearing sounds, like branches being dragged down the side of the patrol car. There was another sound, too, and it was awful - it was the sound of an animal screaming in pain. The patrol car flipped over more times than I could truly know, until it settled on its side in a narrow ditch. The seatbelt was tight across my chest and I gasped for breath. There was something hot and wet dribbling into my right eye and turning the world crimson. I knew I was bleeding from the head - how badly, I didn't know. The mewing and screeching sound came again, filtering into my mind as if I were hearing it from underwater. I looked to the right, a sudden splinter of pain knifing its way through my shoulder. The windscreen was a spider web of cracks. Even so, I could see the bloody devastation spread along the road before me. A horse lay on its side, its giant head twitching left and right on its long, veiny neck as it fought to stand. From where I lay trapped in my crumpled squad car, I could see that the horse would never stand again. Further along the road, crushed against a bracken-covered wall, I could see what looked like a wagon. There was a giant wheel which spun lazily around and around. At first I couldn't make out what I was looking at. With a set of trembling fingers, I clawed the blood from my eyes. It was then I saw what looked like a series of jet-black sheets billowing in the wind. But they weren't sheets, flags, or sails. They were the dresses and clothes of the family who had recently moved onto old Farmer Moore's land. The family which the locals had named the witches now lay scattered, bloody, and lifeless along the remote country road. I closed my eyes on the nightmarish scene.</p><p>Blindly, I fumbled for my radio and pressed the talk switch with my thumb. Please let there be a signal, I whispered to myself.</p><p>\"Zulu-Control from Romeo-Three,\" I gasped in pain and shock. \"Urgent assistance...I need urg...\"</p><p>My world went as black as those witches' robes fluttering around the dead bodies in the road. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The whoop-whoop sound of approaching sirens faded in and out, like waves crashing over me then retreating again. A dull thud beat at my temples and I just wanted to throw up. My eyelids flickered as I peered through the broken windscreen of my patrol car. The world looked as if it had been tipped over onto its side. There were congealed pools of black blood beneath the spinning wheels of the overturned cart, and its occupants, who now lay lifelessly, their black clothing fluttering in the breeze.</p><p>Had I caused this? My mind screamed.</p><p>The world started to fade again, part of me relieved that I didn't have to look at those bodies, the mewing horse, and the spinning wheels of the cart. I wanted the darkness to come and take me again. I wanted it to drown me, wash me away from here and never bring me back. I closed my eyes, drawing deep, shallow breaths into my chest, which was crushed flat against the steering wheel.</p><p>Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!</p> <p>The sound of the sirens growing closer now, bringing with them my father. In the darkness of my own semi-consciousness, I could see him, stiff-backed behind the wheel of his immaculate squad car. His uniform, crisply ironed, the creases down the sleeves and across his broad shoulders, sharp as razors. His keen grey eyes staring straight ahead, finely cropped hair and bushy moustache making him look more like an army sergeant major than a cop. I could picture him stepping from the car, his black boots so highly polished that they glinted like diamonds in the winter sun. I could see the disappointment - the anger - in his face when he surveyed the scene and realised what I had done. It wouldn't take him long to figure this mess out - he would know this was one of my fuck-ups. But I had done nothing like this before - this was the fuck-up of all fuck-ups!</p><p>I glanced once more through the web of cracks in the windscreen, hoping that perhaps the dead and the horse and cart had somehow magically disappeared. They hadn't, and in those cracks, which did little to mask the carnage spread across the road, I saw the flicker of luminous blue lights as my father's patrol car arrived on scene. I could see the word ECILOP written in blue across the bonnet, and through the cracked windscreen it looked distorted out of shape. Over the sound of the squealing sirens, I could hear his boots pounding quickly over the gravelled road as he raced towards my upturned patrol car. Today his boots weren't glistening with polish, but with flecks of blood. I closed my eyes against the pain in my head and chest. I couldn't bear to look into his eyes. I didn't want to see the disappointment I knew would be in them.</p><p>\"Sydney! Sydney!\" I heard his deep voice thunder.</p><p>A hand grabbed my shoulder. Without having to open my eyes, I knew it was my father's. I knew his touch.</p><p>\"Sydney?\" he barked, but his voice didn't sound angry; it sounded confused - scared.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and twisted my head to look at him.</p><p>\"Sydney, what happened here? Are you okay?\" he breathed beneath his thick, black moustache.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, dad,\" I whispered, trying to fill my lungs with enough air so as to speak.</p><p>My father's face was just inches from mine as he kneeled, peering through the driver's window at me. My breath covered his worried face and he recoiled as the stale whiskey fumes wafted beneath his nose. They were unmistakeable. Just as I knew it would - and could I have really expected anything different - that look of fear and concern left my father's eyes and was replaced with something close to despair and disgust for me.</p><p>\"What have you done?\" he said, sounding as if he was going to choke. He looked back at the road, the bloody bodies, screeching horse and cart, then back at me.</p><p>\"Oh, sweet Jesus, Sydney, what have you done?\"</p> <p>\"I'm sorry...\" I started to murmur, but the sound of his radio squawking garbled messages cut over me.</p><p>My father left me in the car, lying on its side in the road. I heard the crunch of his boots over gravel. Murmuring in pain, I twisted my head to the left as I followed the sound of his footsteps. Had he left me to sort out this mess on my own? I wondered. I heard him speaking, but even through the foggy haze of my pounding mind, I knew he was talking to someone on his mobile phone and not his radio. How did I know? His voice was hushed, and there was no garbled reply from whoever he was speaking to.</p><p>The world started to swim before me again like I had just stepped off a spinning roundabout. There was a scraping noise and I twisted my head again and could see my father yanking open the driver's door of my squad car. The bottom portion of the door scraped across the gravel, leaving what looked like white claw marks on the road. I winced in pain as my father struggled to free me from the car. He released my seatbelt, and at once it felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from my chest. I gasped in a lungful of breath, and instantly, that hazy feeling left my mind. Slipping his arms beneath mine, my father levered me free of my wrecked vehicle. He held me by the shoulders, helping me stand. My legs felt rubbery and I gripped his strong arms. Blood dripped in a thick stream from my forehead, spattering my white police shirt crimson. I looked down at the ground and it was covered in a crisscross maze of tyre marks where a vehicle had braked suddenly.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" he barked, his face so close to mine that the tips of our noses almost touched.</p><p>\"Yes, I'm okay,\" I whispered, dabbing at the cut on my head with my fingertips.</p><p>He looked into my blue eyes, like a doctor checking to see if I were truly conscious. When he had satisfied himself I wasn't going to drop to the ground, he let go of me and roared, \"Look what you've done, you stupid girl!\"</p><p>I didn't want to look at him. I couldn't bear to see that disapproving glare of his. It hurt me, and always had for a long as I could remember. That's why mum had left him - he had looked at her the same way if the house was messy, or his dinner hadn't been cooked just right. She was gone now - lived in Spain with her hot rod of a guy, Julio. Good luck to her!</p><p>\"Look!\" my father barked, taking my face in one of his giant hands and snapping my head towards the carnage in the road. \"Look what you've done!\"</p> <p>\"I'm sorr...\" I started.</p><p>\"You've been drinking, haven't you!\" he almost screamed, his face growing white in anger. \"Don't you dare try and deny it. I can smell the booze on your breath.\"</p><p>I looked again at the lifeless bodies...oh, my God...one of them looked really small...a child? I began to shake uncontrollably as the realisation of what I'd done finally hit me like a blunt axe through my skull. Tears began to stream down my face and my bottom lip began to wobble.</p><p>\"Oh, my God,\" I said, my legs buckling in the middle. Before I'd dropped to my knees, my father gripped me by the arm, dragging me like a drunk towards the dead in the street.</p><p>\"Look! Look! Look what you've done!\" he roared in my ear. \"Take a look! You've killed people here! You've killed an entire fucking family!\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry...please...stop...I'm so...\" I begged him, clinging to his arm.</p><p>\"Look!\" he hissed, shoving me again towards the wreckage, the blood - the horror of what I had done. With tears streaming down my face and snot swinging from my nose, I stood, shaking and sobbing.</p><p>The wooden cart was tipped onto its side. Half of it was smashed and splintered like matchwood. There had been seats, but they had partially come free and stuck upwards into the bleak afternoon sky, like broken limbs. There was a body of a young woman, perhaps no older than me, trapped beneath one of the uprooted seats. One of her arms was wrapped at an unnatural angle about her own throat as if she had somehow strangled herself to death. Her face stared upwards like a pale moon, eyes wide and blank, mouth open showing her teeth. I looked away, but only into the face of another. This was a man, it was impossible to tell his age, his face was smeared black with blood. The centre of his body was trapped beneath one of the giant iron wheels. Part of the wheel was imbedded in his chest, like a length of cheese wire brought to a halt halfway through a thick lump of cheddar. There was another man, older, his face wrinkled with lines of age, each one like a deep valley, crisscrossing around his dead eyes and thin lips. A flap of skin had come away on his forehead and it hung down the length of his right cheek like a bloody bandage. I looked away and wished I hadn't. What confronted me was far worse than anything I'd yet seen. There was a child - a little boy. He had flame-red hair, and was wearing a smart black coat, shorts, and socks and shoes. One of them had come off and lay beside him. It looked like something one of those expensive porcelain dolls would wear. It wasn't the only thing about the boy which reminded me of a doll; it was his face. Soft, pure white looking in contrast to his bright hair. He couldn't have been any older than six. Slowly, I edged my way towards him. I wanted to pick the little boy up, cradle him in my arms and tell him I was sorry for what I had done. It was then that I noticed his hair wasn't auburn - it was only reddish-brown in colour because of the blood which flowed from the giant opening in the side of his head.</p><p>I lurched away and threw up into a nearby ditch. Vomit swung from my chin like a pendulum, and my stomach knotted. I leant forward, holding my sides, as I vomited again. It was hot and smelt of whiskey. I felt an arm slide around my shoulders. My father straightened me up, and held me in his arms. I felt the stiffness, the anger leave his body.</p><p>\"This can be sorted,\" he whispered in my ear. \"We can work this whole thing out.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" I murmured into his chest.</p><p>\"No one needs to know what really happened out here,\" he hushed, holding me tight. \"Just do as I tell you and I can put this right.\"</p><p>\"But the people...the dead people...\" I cried. \"I've been drinking...\"</p><p>Then, holding me at arm's length, my father stared straight into my eyes and said, \"Listen to me, Sydney. This was an accident caused by these people - not you!\"</p><p>\"But I killed...\" I sobbed.</p><p>He shook me by the shoulders and said, \"You're not listening to me. These people are nothing - they are nobodies. Drifters who come into town once a year for the summer then move on again. No one gives a shit about them. No one knows their names or anything about them. If we deal with this right, the story will make a few local headlines at the most. I can make this all go away if you just do and say as I tell you.\"</p><p>\"But how?\" I said, looking over his shoulder at the wreckage.</p><p>\"What were you doing out here?\" he suddenly asked, then said, \"On second thought, don't tell me. I don't want to know. The less I know, the better for everyone. But you heard the control room calling you, right?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" I nodded, looking back at him, wiping the tears from my face.</p><p>\"Okay,\" he said thoughtfully. \"So you heard the message and thought a colleague was asking for urgent assistance. So you switched on your sirens and lights and started to head back towards town. These people would have heard you coming, but did nothing to move out of your way. You rounded the bend back there, and instead of moving out of the way, or pull in, they kept coming towards you. The horse got scared by the flashing lights and the sirens, and the old guy lost control of the creature. It pulled the cart and it's passengers across the road and you collided with them. That's what happened, wasn't it?\"</p><p>\"But...I'd been drinking. I wasn't looking where...\" I mumbled.</p><p>\"The horse got scared and...\" My father cut dead as we were joined on the road by another patrol car.</p><p>He let go of my shoulders and headed towards the two officers who were climbing out. They hadn't arrived with lights and sirens blazing, but silently. I recognised the two cops who got out of the car. Mac and Woody. Both had been friends of my father's for as long as I could remember. They had all been recruits together. They had visited our home often over the years with their wives and children. My father was now their sergeant.</p><p>\"Mac!\" my father hollered. \"Bring me a breathalyser.\"</p><p>Mac reached back into the car, then came trotting over to us, Woody by his side. Both of them looked at me, the blood congealing on my forehead, then at the accident.</p><p>\"Jeezus,\" Woody whistled between his front teeth.</p><p>My father took the breathalyser from Mac, then placing a white plastic tube onto the top of it, he took a deep breath. He placed the tube into his mouth and blew until the little green light flashed on the front of the device.</p><p>\"Okay, so you blew a green,\" my father said openly in front of the other two officers.</p><p>\"But...\" I started, feeling confused and a little shocked by what my father had just done.</p><p>\"She blew a green, isn't that right?\" my father said, looking at his two friends.</p><p>\"She sure did,\" Mac said, taking the breathalyser from my father.</p><p>\"But you blew for me,\" I stammered.</p><p>\"That blow to her head must be worse than it looks,\" Woody cut in. \"Your girl is hallucinating, Richard.\"</p><p>\"Both of you saw her blow a green, right?\" my father said, fixing his friends with his grey stare.</p><p>\"That's what's going down in our statements,\" Mac said.</p><p>\"See,\" my father said, looking back at me. \"Two witnesses saw you blow a green, and not just any old witnesses. Two police officers. Looking back at Woody, my father said, \"Go and switch on the sirens and lights on my daughter's squad car.\"</p><p>Woody nodded, and ran over to the car which still lay on its side. He bent down and reached in, and almost at once, strobes of blue and red light filled the darkening sky and the whoop-whoop sound of sirens filled the air.</p><p>\"I'll never get used to how loud those freaking things are,\" Mac said, sealing the breathalyser, just in case it was needed at a later date.</p><p>\"I know, they are so loud, it makes you wonder how these drifters didn't hear them,\" my father said, looking me straight in the eyes.</p><p>\"Scared the shit out of the horse by the looks of things,\" Mac added with a knowing smile.</p><p>It was like the three of them were reading from some well-rehearsed script. Although my father was desperately trying to get me out of trouble, I couldn't help but feel shocked by his deceitfulness. I had never seen this side of him before.</p><p>My father must have seen the disbelief in my eyes, as he came towards me and took me by the shoulders again. \"You are a copper,\" he said. \"If the truth came out about what really happened here, you could go to prison for a very long time for D and D and causing death by dangerous driving. Is that what you want?\"</p><p>Numbly, I shook my head.</p><p>\"Do you want to ruin your life because of a few nobodies who got in the way?\" he asked me, his eyes never leaving mine.</p><p>I shook my head. \"No,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"You're a copper,\" he reminded me again with a squeeze of my shoulder. \"We're all coppers here and we look after one another. We stick together. Right?\"</p><p>\"Right,\" I nodded slowly, now not sure if I were more in shock at what my father had just done or because of the accident itself.</p><p>\"Good,\" my father, said. Looking at Woody, he added, \"Do me a favour and take my daughter home. Then get back here double quick.\"</p><p>\"No probs, Rich,\" Woody said, taking me by the arm.</p><p>\"Right, let's get the circus going,\" my father said to Mac.</p><p>Mac nodded back at my father, then took the radio from his belt and spoke into it.</p><p>\"Control from Romeo-Two, we have an RTA out on the old Buckmore Road. We have at least four fatals...\"</p><p>Before he could finish, there was the sound of someone or something groaning in pain. All of us looked back at the bodies scattered across the road. My heart leapt into my throat as I saw the old man, with the lined and wrinkled face move. I pulled myself free from Woody's grasp and raced towards the man. I knelt down beside him and could see that his eyelids were flickering.</p><p>\"He's still alive!\" I hollered at my father. \"Quick! Get an ambulance.\"</p><p>My father and the others were at my side in an instant, the three of them peering down over my shoulder. The old man moved again, just a twitch of his arm. This time he opened his eyes and stared straight up at me. I flinched backwards. The whites of his eyes were a milky yellow, both of them clouded over with cataracts. This was something not missed by Mac.</p><p>\"Jeezus,\" he sighed. \"No wonder the old fucker steered right out in front of you Sydney, he's almost blind.\"</p><p>I knew this point would be raised in all of their statements.</p><p>The old man's lips moved, as if he were trying to say something. I leaned in closer as I desperately fought to hear what it was he was trying to say. Suddenly, I felt a bony hand grip my arm. I gasped out loud and looked down to see the old man's gnarled and swollen fingers curled around my wrist like a deformed claw. He pulled me down towards him.</p><p>With my face almost touching his, I could feel his breath caress my cheek like a hot kiss.</p><p>\"Witch,\" he whispered in my ear. \"Witch!\"</p><p>I pulled back from him, my skin prickling with gooseflesh. There was a rattling sound in the back of his throat, a red bauble of blood appeared between his dry, flaky lips. With his milky-coloured eyes rolling back in their sockets, the old man took one last breath and fell still.</p><p>\"What did he say?\" my father barked, pulling me to my feet.</p><p>I looked at him, too numb to answer.</p><p>\"What did he say?\" he snapped again.</p><p>\"Witch,\" I whispered. \"He called me a witch.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Woody didn't speak once as he drove me from the scene of the accident and back to my poky apartment in the small town of Cliff View. The town was on the furthest tip of the southwest of England, in the county of Cornwall. It sat nestled between sweeping hills on one side, wide, rolling fields on the other. It was all I had ever known. All that separated Cliff View from the thrashing waves of the Irish Sea were the sleek, black, ragged cliffs. The town itself was quiet in the winter and picked up when the tourists came in the warmer summer months. There wasn't much of a nightlife - or any other kind of life for that matter - unless you ventured into the bigger towns like Penzance. I could have left after I finished college, in search of a career, but I hadn't done well in my exams and after a few failed jobs in the local supermarket, a hairdresser's, and a bar, my father had suggested I joined the police. It hadn't been my first choice, but as my father had pointed out - what other choices had I? I spent most of my teenage years hanging around the local parks, getting drunk with friends, smoking and messing about with boys. My father thought I was a loser - I know he did. But I wasn't a loser - I was just bored. When my mother left with her Spanish toy boy, I drank more than ever. It was then that my father said I needed to get a grip - stop screwing around and get a proper career - get a life!</p><p>So, wanting to please him more than myself, I took his advice and joined the police. It made him happy and proud. I would never be able to forget his look of pride on the day of my passing out parade. Now, I didn't doubt my mother's departure hurt my father badly - but he just never showed it. These days, the only feelings he happily wore on his sleeve, were those feelings of disappointment he had for me.</p><p>Joining the police force hadn't been all bad. In fact, I quite enjoyed it. It paid better than the supermarket and the hairdresser's, enough to move out of my father's house and rent a place of my own. There I could do what I wanted, when I wanted, with whom I wanted, without my father's disapproving stare. So things had been ticking over quite nicely until...until I went back to that farmer's house, had a few drinks, got it on with the lush-looking farmer's son, then went and wiped out a...</p><p>\"Here you go,\" Woody suddenly said, breaking the thick, suffocating silence and my thoughts.</p> <p>I looked up to see that he had pulled to a halt outside the small white painted apartment block. Woody looked at me, his thin, brown hair slicked back off his brow, light blue eyes staring out of his pinched face at me. Woody was okay, I'd known him since I was kid, but his kids had moved on. One was at a university, the other moved to London to become a lawyer or something. I bet my father would never see the day he would have to sneak one of Woody's kids away from a fatal accident. He would never have to blow a green for one of his kids. As teenagers, Woody's kids had never hung around, pissed out of their skulls, with the kids from the local estate. They had been too busy at home, tucked away in their bedrooms and hitting the school books. No wonder my father was so ashamed of me. What a fucking disappointment I had been. I couldn't even be a good cop.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" Woody asked, looking at me like a caring father.</p><p>\"I guess,\" I said, looking down at my hands in my lap. I didn't want him to see the tears standing in my eyes.</p><p>\"Don't you worry about a thing,\" he soothed. \"Your dad has got everything under control.\"</p><p>\"But those people...\" I started, sniffing back the tears.</p> <p>\"Shhh,\" Woody hushed. \"Like your dad said, they should've never been in the road. It was just an accident. It could have happened to any one and anywhere.\"</p><p>\"They're dead because of me,\" I said, lifting my head to look at him. \"It doesn't matter what my father says or does - what any of you do - I know it was all my fault.\"</p><p>\"Now, you need to stop thinking and talking like that,\" Woody said. \"We all have to be singing from the same hymn sheet, or...\"</p><p>\"Or what?\" I cut over him.</p><p>\"Or we're all in the shit,\" he whispered as if someone might overhear us somehow. \"Do you want your dad to get into trouble? He's risking his career for you.\"</p><p>\"I never asked him to, Woody,\" I said, reaching for the door handle. I didn't know how much more guilt I could take.</p> <p>Before I'd the chance to open the door fully, Woody had taken hold of my arm and pulled me back into my seat. \"Listen, Sydney, why do you think your father did what he did today?\"</p><p>I looked at him and said nothing.</p><p>\"Because you're his little girl and he loves you,\" Woody said. \"He just doesn't want to see you get into trouble for the sake of a few...\"</p><p>\"People,\" I cut in. \"They were people who died today.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" he sighed. \"But they're not like us.\"</p><p>\"So that makes it okay then?\" I snapped. \"We just pretend it didn't happen?\"</p><p>\"No one's pretending it didn't happen,\" he said back, his voice starting to harden with me. \"But they're dead - nothing is going to bring them back. Their lives are over - you can't change that - none of us can. What we can change is what happens from here, from this moment on. What happened was an accident. That's all it was. You're gonna feel guilty for years to come - isn't that sentence enough?\"</p><p>\"But I don't like lying,\" I said, looking away again towards the cliffs and the sea.</p> <p>\"So what do you like, Sydney?\" Woody asked. \"Do you want to see your dad unhappy? Do you want him to feel the shame that any decent father would feel if their daughter were sent to prison? Your father is a proud man. What do you think you going to prison will do to him? Huh? It will kill him - that's what it will do. Isn't it bad enough that his wife has run off with someone half his age? Don't you think that hurts him? I don't know about you, but I see the humiliation in his eyes every time I look at him.\"</p><p>\"I see it, too,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"So how do you think he's gonna feel if he loses you, too?\" Woody said, his voice softening now, trying to reason with me. \"Who do you care more about? Those drifters or your father? They can't suffer anymore - but your father can. Telling the truth about what happened today isn't going to change anything except break your father's heart. Is that what you want?\"</p><p>\"No,\" I breathed, knowing that I had broken my father's heart enough - but nothing like this.</p><p>There was a pause, a short silence before Woody spoke again. \"If I were you, I'd go inside, run myself a nice hot bath, relax, and then get some sleep. You're upset - shook up - that's understandable. Things will seem different tomorrow.\"</p><p>I looked at him, a kind smile on his face. \"I promise this time tomorrow, things won't seem so bad. Just leave it to me and your dad to sort this thing out.\"</p><p>Without saying anything more, I opened the car door and stepped out. It had gotten colder and I folded my arms across the front of my blood-stained shirt. I made my way towards my apartment. At the door I looked back, but Woody had gone, racing back towards the road and the accident. I took my front door key from the chain on my belt, opened the door, and stepped inside. With the door closed behind me, I sunk to the floor, pulling my knees up beneath my chin. There I sat until the last of the daylight, which cut through the windows, throwing my apartment into darkness. I knew in my heart I wasn't doing the right thing - the honest thing by those people who had died on the road. That little boy deserved more. He deserved justice. But what about my father? If I owned up to what had truly happened, then I ran the risk of ruining him and his career, too. How would I ever live with that?</p><p>Those drifters can't suffer anymore - but your father can, I heard Woody whisper, as if he were sitting on the floor next to me.</p><p>Hadn't I caused my father enough shame and embarrassment while growing up? Hadn't my mother caused him enough humiliation by running off with a guy half her age? Could I stick another thorn in his side?</p><p>When I felt as if I couldn't cry anymore, and my head aching, I ripped off the blood-stained shirt. Standing, I went to the bathroom and turned on the light. Blood had soaked through the shirt and onto my bra. I took that off too, throwing both items to the tiled floor. I looked in the mirror above the sink. The cut to my brow wasn't deep, but the skin around it had started to swell and turn an angry red. Taking Woody's advice, I ran a bath, removing the rest of my uniform and leaving it where it had dropped. I couldn't care if I never wore that uniform again. Did I deserve to? I wondered.</p><p>I lay back in the water, tendrils of stream wafting upwards, covering the mirror with condensation. I closed my eyes, desperate to unscramble my mind. I needed to try and make sense of everything that had happened; to come to terms with what I had done. There was a sudden sound - a knocking. I opened my eyes and gasped. The word Witch had been written in the watery condensation that now covered my bathroom mirror. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I snapped my eyes open with a start and looked at the mirror. It was covered in condensation - there was no writing. My heart was racing in my chest. I took a towel, which hung over the side of the bath, and got out. With the towel wrapped about me, I stood in front of the mirror and wiped away the moisture with the flat of my hand. Definitely no writing. I had fallen asleep in the bath and dreamt the whole thing up. But what about the knocking? I wondered, creeping into the small lounge and heading for the front door. There was a sudden bang and I span around. The noise had come from outside. I crossed to the window and peered into the darkness. The guy who lived upstairs from me was knocking on his own front door, trying to wake the rake-thin girl who lived up there with him.</p><p>With my heart beginning to slow, I closed the curtain and went to my bedroom. Sitting on the edge of my bed, I towelled my hair dry. In my head I could hear the old man out on the road - it was like I could feel his hot, sticky breath against my face.</p><p>Witch! he whispered.</p><p>Why had he called me that? Was it because I had killed him and his family, or was it a warning? A curse?</p> <p>With my skin turning taut with gooseflesh, I dropped the towel onto the floor and crawled beneath the duvet. I pulled it over my head, hoping it would muffle the sound of the old guy's voice. With my eyes closed, I tried to think of anything other than what had happened out on the road. It was hard, as all I could see in the darkness of my mind was that little boy and his pale white face framed by his red, blood-stained hair.</p><p>I didn't want to, but I had to look at him - go to him. My feet crunched over gravel and the tyre marks on the road. When I was within touching distance, I crouched and reached for him. With the tips of my fingers, I gently brushed the hair from his brow. His fringe was knotted together in thick congealed lumps, which felt hot and tacky against my fingertips.</p><p>I'm so sorry, I whispered.</p><p>As if hearing my voice stirred him from a light and restful slumber, the little boy opened his eyes and looked at me. I stumbled backwards onto my arse. A crow squawked from one of the adjacent fields, the sound of its giant black wings beating as it soared away. I looked towards the sound and cried out - my voice seeming muffled and broken. It wasn't the sound of the crow's wings that I could hear flapping, but the clothes of that dead family as they pulled themselves to their feet. With my hands clamped to either side of my face, I watched the man with the wheel buried in his chest slide out from beneath it. The iron wheel began to turn slowly, pulling out the man's intestines in white, greasy-looking lengths of rope.</p><p>Witch, I heard the old man say again.</p> <p>I looked over my shoulder to see him standing, his emaciated face covered with skin which looked like the texture of a crinkled plastic bag.</p><p>Witch, he said again, then added something he hadn't said before. Witch did it.</p><p>I scrambled backwards on my arse as he limped towards me, looking like something from a cheaply-made zombie movie. His arms twitched uncontrollably, giving him the appearance of someone suffering in the latter stages of Parkinson's disease. There was another sound. I snapped my head to the right. The woman with her arm wrapped around her throat pushed herself up off the road with her free hand. Her face was so pale that it looked like a headlamp in the dark. It almost seemed to glow. I watched as her eyes rolled down in their sockets and stared at me.</p><p>Well? she whispered, her voice sounding hoarse.</p><p>Well, what? I screamed at her. It was an accident! I never meant to hurt you!</p><p>Something fell against my shoulder. Whatever it was, it was so cold that I could feel it through my police shirt, causing me to shiver. I glanced up to discover the little boy standing behind me, his hand gripping my shoulder. His skin was as white as a fish's belly. I recoiled at his ice-cold touch and clambered away. Once on my feet, I lurched and staggered down the road. There was an opening on my right in the grey stone wall which surrounded the adjacent field. The ground was sodden through with rain, and pools of mud oozed from beneath my boots. It was cold, damp, and clammy, which made it hard to breathe as I ran across the field, just wanting to be away from those dead people - the people I had killed. I could hear the sound of crows squawking behind me. Glancing back over my shoulder, I could see four black shapes cutting their way across the field at speed towards me. Their jerking, twitchy movements did nothing to slow them down. I turned, drawing a deep lungful of cold air. There was a crop of trees ahead of me. I set off towards them, hoping I could hide amongst the twisted, black trunks.</p> <p>With a stitch starting to gnaw away at my side, I reached the treeline and looked back across the field. The old man and the other three were just feet away from me now.</p><p>How had they gotten across the field so fast?</p><p>The wind snagged at their black clothing, making it ripple like black feathers around them. The squawking came again - high-pitched and ear-splitting.</p><p>Witch! The old man cackled as if gargling on a throat full of blood.</p><p>I turned and headed amongst the trees. The sound of my laboured breathing and pounding heart was almost deafening. Which way? Which way should I run? I screamed inside, feeling disorientated and lost. The trees seemed to crowd in all around me. The gaps between each gnarled trunk seeming to get ever smaller with each passing second.</p><p>The sound of squawking and the fluttering of wings - clothes - came from above me. I looked up, speckled grey daylight glinting through the canopy of leaves above me. The branches of the trees entwined like broken fingers twisting around each other, cutting out what little daylight there was, throwing me into darkness. I stumbled backwards on hearing the sound of those people coming closer as they made their way towards me in the dark. I was falling backwards into a hole. I threw my arms out, desperate to break my fall. My fingertips scratched against damp stone on either side of me. Into the darkness I fell, a dim circle of grey light growing smaller and smaller above me. I hit something hard, forcing the air from my lungs.</p><p>Gasping for breath, I lay at the bottom of a deep well. It stank of decay - meat that had turned bad. My hair hung over my eyes and across my face.</p><p>\"Help me!\" I called upwards, my voice echoing back off the circular walls.</p> <p>There was a face peering down into the well at me. It was white, like a full moon set against a dead black night.</p><p>\"Help me!\" I cried, reaching up at the face. \"Please, help me!\"</p><p>\"Sydney!\" the face called down into the well. \"Sydney!\"</p><p>It was my father's voice.</p><p>\"Daddy!\" I screamed, feeling relieved to hear his voice. He had come to save me. He had come to lift me out of the hole I now found myself in.</p><p>\"Sydney!\" he called, his voice sounding as if it were coming from miles away. \"Sydney, open the door!\"</p><p>\"Door? What door?\" I sobbed. \"There isn't a door...\"</p><p>\"Open up, Sydney!\" his voice came again, but this time louder. Closer.</p><p>\"Daddy...\" I started to sob, just wanting him to lift me from the hole. I could feel hot tears on my cheeks.</p><p>There was a banging sound, and I turned around and sat up...in my bed. My hair was plastered in damp streaks to my forehead and cheeks. My mouth felt dry, throat raw.</p><p>\"Sydney!\" I could hear my father's voice. \"Sydney - are you in there?\"</p><p>I looked about my bedroom, my head aching, heart racing. The sound of banging came again.</p><p>\"Sydney!\" my father called again from the other side of my front door.</p><p>With my tongue feeling like a thick length of carpet, I croaked, \"Okay, I'm coming!\"</p><p>I doubted he heard me, because no sooner had the words left my mouth, he was banging on the front door again. Swinging my legs over the side of the bed, I got up, took a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms from my wardrobe, and quickly threw them on. A thin splinter of daylight cut through a gap in the curtains. I glanced down at my wristwatch and could see that it had gone half past eight in the morning.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>\"Okay, okay! I'm coming,\" I said, leaving my bedroom and heading for the front door.</p><p>I opened it to find my father standing on the other side.</p><p>\"Christ, you look like shit,\" my father snapped, brushing past me and into the lounge.</p><p>\"Thanks, dad,\" I said, closing the door behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I caught my father eyeing the room. I was glad it was relatively tidy. There were a couple of Elle magazines scattered on the floor, so I discretely pushed them under the nearest armchair with my foot. With a grunt, my father turned to face me. He was wearing his uniform, and as always, he looked immaculate in it. He took a beige coloured file from under his arm and handed it to me.</p><p>\"What's this?\" I asked.</p><p>\"It's your statement about what happened yesterday,\" he said, crossing the room to the window and pulling back the curtain.</p><p>\"I haven't written my statement,\" I said, opening the file to find several typed sheets of paper.</p> <p>\"I wrote it for you,\" he said, turning to face me.</p><p>\"I think it's best if I were to write my own...\" I started.</p><p>\"We all need to be saying the same thing,\" he said, taking a pen from his shirt pocket and offering it to me. \"Besides, I've spoken to Inspector Skrimshire in Penzance this morning. I've briefed him on our version of what happened yesterday, and he seems quite satisfied. He does, however, want to see copies of all our statements ASAP. So just sign the statement and I can get one of the team to run him over a copy.\"</p><p>\"But...\" I started, quickly skimming over the statement. It read just how my father had described the incident yesterday as we stood in the road together. I had been driving down the Old Buckmore Road, lights and sirens flashing. The driver of the cart had either refused to steer his horse off the road to let me pass or he hadn't seen the vehicle because of the state of his poor eyesight, in which case he was himself at fault and caused his own death and that of his family. I had given a negative breath test and received minor scrapes and bruises.</p><p>\"Sign it,\" my father said, waving the pen before me.</p> <p>Slowly, I took the pen from him and signed the bottom of each page. I closed the file and handed it back to him with the pen.</p><p>\"What about those people?\" I asked him, my heart beginning to race again.</p><p>\"The drifters?\" he said, cocking one of his thick, black eyebrows at me.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"In the morgue,\" he said flatly, tucking the file back beneath his arm, and the pen into the breast pocket of his shirt. \"Don't worry, the post-mortem has been carried out on the old guy and the pathologist noted the state of his eyesight. The old fella was practically blind.\" Then, placing a hand on my shoulder as if to reassure me, he added, \"See? It wasn't your fault. The old boy shouldn't have been on the road with that horse and cart. The pathologist reckons he wouldn't have been able to see more than a few feet in front of him. The truth of the matter is, the old sod probably steered that horse and cart into you and not the other way around. You're lucky to still be alive.\"</p><p>\"I guess,\" I said thoughtfully. Perhaps my dad was right. Okay, so I had had a couple of whiskeys, but I wasn't drunk. I could hold my liquor - most of my teenage years had been spent in a drunken blur. I knew when I was drunk, and I hadn't been yesterday.</p> <p>\"I'll get the paperwork over to Inspector Skrimshire today so he can contact the coroner,\" my father explained.</p><p>\"Coroner?\" I gasped. \"Will there be an investigation?\"</p><p>\"Calm down,\" he hushed. \"I'm doing the investigation. I'll hand everything over to Skrimshire and he'll pass it onto the coroner's office. There's always an inquest into these things. The coroner will simply want to decide how and when those people came to die, so it can be marked on their death certificates. It's just so they can be buried and their estate can be settled.\"</p><p>\"Do they have any family?\" I asked him.</p><p>\"Mac is looking into it, but it will be like searching for a needle in a haystack,\" he grunted again. \"Like I said, these people don't hold down roots like us. They flutter through life like litter on the wind, moving from one place to the next. Christ, we can't even be sure of their names, let alone anything else. No one is going to miss them. No one cares what happened to them.\"</p><p>I thought that to be very sad. To spend a lifetime and not have anyone miss you when you're gone. Not even to care. With his hand still on my shoulder, my father leant forward and did something he hadn't done since I was a little girl. He kissed me gently on the forehead.</p><p>\"I know you're tearing yourself up inside over what happened, but it was an accident, Sydney. Take a couple of weeks off from work - get a different perspective on things and you'll feel better for it, I promise.\"</p><p>\"I'm not due any leave until...\" I started.</p> <p>\"I'm not just your father, I'm your sergeant, and I'm telling you to take some time off,\" he said. \"Get your bearings, clear your head, and come back when all of this has died down.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said, wondering if I couldn't book myself a cheap flight and go visit with my mother in Spain. Then again, the last time I'd visited, I felt as if I were just in the way. Julio had those smarmy-looking friends who hung about all the time, leering at the English girls. They made my flesh crawl. Maybe I would just stay at home, read a few books, go walking along the shore. I could find plenty to do if I really thought about it. Maybe go and max out the credit card in Penzance? That would be reckless - but fun. There was nothing like a good bit of retail therapy.</p><p>Taking his hand from my shoulder and heading for the door, my father looked back at me and said, \"If I were you, I'd keep away from work. You know what some of them can be like - real gossips. Anything you say will only get bent all out of shape, and we need to keep our stories straight. The less you say about this to anyone, the better. I'll keep out of your way, too, until you get yourself sorted out. Give me a call when you feel like coming back.\"</p><p>He opened the door, and just as he was about to disappear, I said, \"Thanks, dad.\"</p><p>He looked back at me. \"Just keep a low profile for the next week or two until this whole thing blows over.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said.</p><p>\"And promise me, no more screw-ups.\"</p><p>\"I promise,\" I whispered as he shut the door, leaving me alone in my apartment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I drank straight from the bottle of milk in the fridge. Wiping away the white moustache from my upper lip, I went back into the living room in search of my iPod. I'd decided to go for a walk along the beach. I found the whole exercise thing easier if I was listening to music. The scenery nearby was beautiful, but perhaps I didn't appreciate it as much as I should. I'd grown accustomed to it over the years. It was wasted on me, I guess, not like the visitors who came from the overcrowded cities in the summer months. They acted as if they'd never seen a freaking hill, the sea, or sand before. Perhaps they hadn't.</p><p>After searching beneath the pillows on the sofa and in the armchairs, I checked my bedroom but couldn't find my iPod anywhere. I'd have to go for a walk without it. The morning was moving closer to lunchtime, and I wanted to get some fresh air before I spent the afternoon curled up on the sofa reading the rest of my book called Blood, Bullets and Blue Stratos by Tom Graham, which I recently downloaded to my iPad Mini. I hoped that it would take my mind off recent events. I had frozen pizza in the freezer, which I could cook for my dinner. There was a couple of bottles of red wine, too, somewhere.</p><p>I put on a pair of jeans, a coat, and a pair of boots. I left my apartment and made the short walk down to the shore. The beach was empty, apart from a couple of dog-walkers way off in the distance. I turned my back on them and began walking in the opposite direction, towards the massive black cliffs which loomed in the distance like giant ogres. Waves crashed up the beach, then retreated again. The sea was a dark green and looked uninviting. Pieces of dirty wood wrapped in black seaweed floated in the foamy waves. The wind was cold and it made my lips taste salty. With my long, blond hair down, it blew about my face like a mask. I liked that, I wanted to be hidden. I wanted time to clear my head, just like my father had suggested. I didn't want to dwell on what had happened, I'd done enough of that in my nightmares, and part of me feared falling to sleep that night. Would my dreams be haunted by those dead people again? I guessed I had a few more nights of disturbed sleep before I'd truly come to terms with what I had done - before the accident.</p><p>Bent against the bitter wind, I headed along the shore, a set of footprints trailing away behind me. I'd been walking for about ten minutes or so, when I thought I heard someone calling my name. At first I wondered if it wasn't my imagination, or a trick being played by the howling wind. I looked back in the direction I had come, but all I could see was the tiny black outlines of those dog-walkers way off in the distance.</p> <p>\"Sydney!\" the voice came again.</p><p>I looked to my left to see someone running down the grassy sand dunes towards me. It was Michael.</p><p>\"Oh, Christ,\" I murmured under my breath as he ran towards me.</p><p>I turned around and set off at speed in the direction I had come from. I didn't want to see Michael - I had nothing to say to him.</p><p>\"Hey, Sydney!\" he called after me. \"Wait up!\"</p> <p>Over the sound of the wind and the crashing waves, I could hear his heavy footfalls as he came running after me across the wet sand.</p><p>Burying my chin into my chest, I leaned forward and sped up almost to a slow trot. It wasn't long before Michael had caught up with me.</p><p>He gripped my arm and said, \"Hey, what's the rush?\"</p><p>\"Leave me alone,\" I snapped, yanking my arm free and setting off up the beach again.</p><p>\"I just want to talk to you, that's all,\" he said, walking beside me.</p><p>\"About what?\" I said, refusing to look at him.</p> <p>\"What happened yesterday, of course,\" he said.</p><p>\"That was a mistake,\" I said coldly. \"Nothing like that will ever happen between us again.\"</p><p>\"I wasn't talking about that,\" he said. \"I was talking about the accident you had. You know, that family dying and all.\"</p><p>I stopped mid-stride as if walking straight into an invisible wall. \"I don't want to talk about it,\" I hissed, glancing sideways at him.</p><p>\"It wasn't your fault,\" he said, his voice soft.</p><p>\"Who said it was my fault?\" I glared at him.</p><p>\"No one said it was your fault,\" he said, looking startled by my overreaction. \"It's just that I thought you might be feeling a bit guilty as you had been drinking whiskey with me.\"</p><p>To hear him say that felt as if I'd been slapped in the face. Despite all the efforts my father had taken to provide a fake breath test and witnesses, here was someone who could testify I'd been drinking before the crash. He would know, as he was the person who had given it to me.</p> <p>\"That wasn't enough to make me drunk,\" I said dismissively, and turned away, wishing that he would just fuck off and leave me alone.</p><p>\"I never said you were drunk,\" he called after me.</p><p>I could hear the sound of his footfalls in the sand behind me again.</p><p>\"Look, Sydney, if it helps, I feel guilty about what happened, too,\" he said.</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" I snapped, wheeling around to face him again.</p><p>\"It was me who gave you that drink, after all,\" he said, looking at me. \"I should have never done that. You were on duty...you're a cop and I put you in a compromising situation.\"</p><p>Clawing a length of hair from out of my eyes, I stared at him and said, \"Look, Michael, let's just forget about what happened between us. No one needs to know what happened.\"</p><p>With his own curly hair blowing about the sides of his handsome face, he looked at me, and said, \"I can't forget about it.\"</p><p>\"You're gonna have to!\" I barked, feeling the urge to scream at him. Michael reappearing wasn't something I had planned for. What would my father say or do if he knew there was someone else who knew I'd been drinking prior to the accident yesterday? It could ruin everything - it could ruin my father's plans - and him - now that he had lied for me.</p><p>\"Michael, just do us both a favour and forget about that accident, because that's all it was. The police are dealing with it now,\" I said and turned away, leaving him standing alone, waves crashing about his boots.</p><p>\"It's not the accident I can't forget about,\" he called out. \"It's you, Officer Sydney Hart, that I can't forget.\"</p><p>\"Oh, please,\" I said, looking back at him over my shoulder. \"You don't even know me.\"</p><p>\"I'd like to get to know you,\" he said, staring straight back at me. \"That's if you would like to get to know me better.\"</p><p>Without saying anything, I faced front and started to walk away from him again. Half of me was screaming to keep on walking and not to look back - to forget all about Michael. He could complicate things. He knew I'd been drinking regardless, my mind started to reason.</p><p>No! Keep right on walking! the rational part of my brain screamed, as I pictured my father.</p><p>But the irrational side - the side that always got me into trouble - threw-up memories of what had happened between me and Michael and how good it had felt. I could feel his hands on me again - the warm sensation I had felt...</p><p>...promise me, no more screw-ups, I heard my father whisper in my ear.</p><p>Pushing the sound of his voice away, I glanced back one last time at Michael and said, \"Do you like pizza?\"</p><p>With a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, he said, \"I can't get enough of it.\"</p><p>Together we walked back along the shore towards my apartment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I took the pizza from the oven and cut it into slices. Michael lent against the frame of the kitchen door, watching me. He had opened the bottle of wine and poured two glasses. I handed him a plate with some of the pizza on it, and in return, he passed me a glass of the wine.</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said, brushing past him and stepping into the living room. I sat at one end of the sofa and he took a seat at the other. We had talked little on the way back from the beach. I don't know if it was me, but there was a kind of nervous tension between us - almost like we had unfinished business between us. I guess in a way, we did. Michael was fit, and there was no denying I was attracted to him. What woman wouldn't be turned on by his strong determined features, soft curly hair, green eyes, and well-defined chest and arms? His butt was good too - firm-looking beneath his jeans.</p><p>With a sudden imaginary flash of me gripping that butt as I pushed him into me, Michael looked up and said, \"What you thinking about?\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" I said, pushing that image of him between my thighs from my mind.</p> <p>\"You look deep in thought,\" he said, then took a bite of his pizza.</p><p>Trying to think of something to say, I flushed scarlet and said, \"What I don't understand is how I've lived in this godforsaken town my whole life but haven't seen you before until the other day?\"</p><p>\"How old are you, Sydney?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Twenty-one in a couple of months,\" I told him, sipping my wine.</p><p>\"Okay, so I would have been about the same age as you when I left Cliff View,\" he said, as if working out a sum in his head. \"So I'm thirty now, that would have made you ten years old.\"</p> <p>I looked at him.</p><p>\"Wow, I don't know if I like the sound of that,\" he half-smiled. \"It makes me sound like a pervert.\"</p><p>\"Are you?\" I shot back smiling.</p><p>\"Am I what?\" he asked.</p><p>\"A perv?\" I said, fixing my eyes on his.</p><p>\"What do you think?\"</p> <p>\"Like I said, I've never seen or met you before until the other day,\" I reminded him. \"This is the third time I've seen you in less than a week. Are you following me?\"</p><p>\"You came back to the farm, remember?\" he said, placing his empty plate on the floor by the sofa.</p><p>\"To take your statement,\" I said.</p><p>\"Was that the only reason?\" he shot back, then took another sip from the wine glass.</p><p>There was a pause, then downing what was left in the bottom of my own glass, I looked at him and said, \"No, it wasn't the only reason I came back to the farm.\"</p><p>Inching his way along the sofa towards me, Michael placed his wine glass on the floor so both of his hands were free. \"So why did you come back?\" he asked, and again, there was that intensity in his eyes I had first seen a few days ago.</p><p>\"The same reason you came looking for me today,\" I said, matching his stare.</p><p>\"I wanted to make sure you were okay,\" he said, the gap between us now paper-thin.</p> <p>\"You came looking for me because you wanted to finish what we started the other day,\" I whispered, those feelings I had previously felt flooding back. That sweet warm sensation spreading from my stomach and down between my legs.</p><p>\"Is there anything wrong with that?\" he said, placing one hand gently on the base of my neck, pulling me close so I could feel his breath against my face.</p><p>\"No, but I'm not looking for anything serious,\" I whispered into his ear, one of my hands running up the length of his muscular thigh. \"There is a lot in my life I need to square away. I need some time to think...\"</p><p>\"I don't want to marry you, Sydney,\" he whispered back. \"I just want to fuck you. Is that so bad?\" he said softly against my cheek, his fingers losing themselves in my hair.</p><p>\"I guess not...\" I started. Before I'd had a chance to finish, Michael had pressed his lips over mine.</p><p>I opened my mouth slightly, but it was enough for Michael to slip his tongue inside. His mouth tasted of sweet wine, and I slid my tongue over his. He explored the inside of my mouth, our tongues pushing and prodding against each other as if acting out what it was other parts of our body really wanted to do. Taking his hands from my hair, he pulled at my sweater. Breaking our kiss and raising my arms above my head, he pulled my sweater free, tossing it across the room. He looked down at my breasts. Gently cupping them in his hands, Michael lent forward, running his tongue over them. I reached down and loosened the belt which held his jeans in place. My fingers brushed over the front of them and I could feel he was already hard beneath the blue faded denim. He shifted as if kneeling up, so I could undo the button fly. The buttons popped open beneath my trembling fingers. I wasn't scared or nervous, just turned on.</p><p>Michael arched his back as I fumbled the last button free. I reached inside, my fingers curling around him. He felt hard. Michael groaned. With the fingers of one hand curled around him, I pulled Michael's jeans down further. Placing my hands flat against his chest, I pushed him back onto the sofa. He reached for my breasts again and I slapped his hands away.</p><p>He looked at me wide-eyed.</p><p>\"No,\" I said.</p><p>\"But I want to hold...\"</p><p>\"Do as I say,\" I snapped at him. I knew from what had happened between us the previous day, he liked the idea of me being a cop and being in control.</p><p>Michael looked at me, not knowing if I were joking, acting, or being serious. As if trying to test me, he reached for my breasts again.</p><p>\"I said, no!\" I hissed at him as he grew harder in my hand. He was secretly enjoying me taking charge of him.</p><p>Closing his eyes, Michael finally lay back on the sofa in submission.</p><p>I got up and stood, looking down at him.</p><p>\"Don't let go,\" he murmured.</p><p>\"Be quiet!\" I snapped. \"Don't you dare tell me what to do!\" Michael lay flat on his back, his cock standing up from the centre of him, looking solid and unbreakable. \"Do you understand?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he groaned, reaching for himself, now so desperate to be released that he would happily do it himself.</p><p>I slapped his hand away, and he groaned - in pleasure or frustration, I didn't know which. I looked at his muscular frame, his thick round shoulders like two giant cannonballs, and his perfectly toned stomach, and muscular thighs. I had total control over him and it turned me on.</p><p>I slid my jeans down over my hips. Michael heard the rustle of my clothes and opened his eyes, wanting to see my naked body.</p><p>\"Did I say you could open your eyes?\" I breathed.</p><p>\"No,\" he murmured, shutting them tight again.</p><p>\"You do as I say or just get out.\"</p><p>Michael flinched at what I said and I became more excited.</p><p>I knelt down beside him, and taking hold of him again, I slowly eased my hand up and down. I did this until Michael was groaning with pleasure. I stopped.</p><p>\"What!\" Michael gasped, opening his eyes again and looking straight at me.</p><p>\"Did I say you could look at me?\" I hissed at him.</p><p>\"Don't stop what you were doing,\" he begged.</p><p>\"I've changed my mind,\" I said with a sly smile. \"I don't think I want you anymore.\"</p><p>\"You can't just stop!\" he breathed.</p><p>\"So what are you gonna do about it?\" I teased.</p><p>With a crazed look of desire on his face, Michael snatched hold of my hand and leapt up. \"I'll show you what I'm gonna do about it!\" he barked, gripping me by my shoulders and spinning me around. Placing his weight against me, he forced me over the arm of the sofa. Pushing one of his legs between mine, he forced them open.</p><p>\"You're not going to fuck me,\" I groaned, the tip of his cock brushing against me, all the while just wanting him.</p><p>\"I'll fuck you if I want to,\" he grunted, pushing his cock fully into me.</p><p>I cried out in pleasure, as he knotted his hands in my hair, forcing my face down into the sofa cushions. He jerked his powerful hips backwards and forwards as he thrust in and out of me, pushing me ever closer to that moment of ecstasy. I could feel myself growing hotter, a knot of pleasure unravelling, spreading out from my core and throughout my body.</p><p>\"Is this the best you can do?\" I groaned.</p><p>\"I'll fucking teach you to tease me,\" he breathed heavily, pushing ever harder and deeper into me. Michael's strokes became frantic, as he bucked his hips backwards and forwards. With each hard thrust, the heat inside me grew more intense until my whole body felt as it were on fire. My arms, fingertips, legs, and toes began to tingle and I gripped the back of the sofa as the feeling of pleasure inside of me and between my legs became unbearable. Unable to stand it any longer, I felt my whole body spasm. At the same time, Michael arched his back, locked rigid, and then seemed to tremble violently. Both of us cried out in utter pleasure. Michael began to slow, until he finally stopped.</p><p>We collapsed onto the sofa, me on my front, Michael on his back, our legs entwined. All I could hear was the sound of our heavy breathing, both fighting to catch our breath.</p><p>\"That was fucking...unbelievable...\" Michael finally said in a series of shallow breaths. \"No one has ever got me going like that before. I've never wanted to fuck a woman so badly in my life.\"</p><p>I rolled over onto my side, my skin feeling hot, tingly, and alive. \"I'm glad you enjoyed it,\" I smiled at him, my fingertips trailing across his chest.</p><p>\"You're not like any woman I've been with before,\" he said, glancing sideways at me, his chest rising and falling as he still fought to catch his breath. \"You're kinda complex.\"</p><p>\"How come?\" I asked back.</p><p>\"You have some crazy issues.\"</p><p>\"You think?\" I said, getting up. I pulled my sweater back over my head, and put on my panties, which were lying next to my discarded jeans on the floor. I left the room.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" he called after me.</p><p>\"To the bathroom,\" I whispered, closing the door behind me before he had a chance to see the tears which were spilling down my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tried to muffle my sobs by placing a towel against my face. My shoulders shook as I sat on the toilet and cried. Was there no part of my life, other than what I did in bed, which I was in control of? I kept messing up and in my heart I knew that I'd just messed up again by having sex with Michael - however good it had been.</p><p>My father had warned me to lay low - use the time by myself to think things through - not to complicate the situation further. But with an hour or so of him leaving, I'd gone and had sex with the one person who knew that the death of those poor people hadn't been a simple accident. It had happened because I was trying to run from a situation I should've never been in while on duty. I'd been speeding and not concentrating on the road. I'd been looking for chewing gum to try and mask the fact I'd been drinking. Why couldn't I just listen to my father?</p><p>But maybe that was the point? Perhaps I was so sick and tired of listening to him - trying to please him and make him happy, that I seized every opportunity that came along to disappoint him. Why did he have to be so controlling - why couldn't he let me make my own mistakes? But he was a good man, wasn't he? After all, wasn't he just looking out for me? What would I have done without him yesterday? But I knew in my heart why I had gone back to the farm while on duty, why I'd had sex with Michael just moments ago. Because it was something I could chose or chose not to do. Maybe Michael was right? Perhaps I was crazy and had issues.</p><p>Michael must have heard me sobbing, because there was a gentle knock at the bathroom door. \"Hey, Sydney, are you okay?\"</p> <p>\"I'm fine,\" I lied, sniffing back my tears behind the towel.</p><p>\"Look, I didn't mean to upset you,\" he said.</p><p>\"You didn't upset me.\"</p><p>\"Why are you crying then?\" he pushed gently.</p><p>Wiping the tears away with the towel, I went to the door and opened it. Michael had put on his jeans. As I went to brush past him, he took me in his arms. \"I didn't mean to hurt you when I said I thought you had issues,\" he said, looking down into my bloodshot eyes.</p> <p>\"It wasn't that which upset me,\" I said, slipping from his arms and going to the living room. I stood by the window and looked out onto the empty street and the sea in the distance.</p><p>\"What is it, then?\" he asked, standing behind me, but keeping a respectful distance.</p><p>\"Everything, I guess,\" I whispered. \"I killed four people yesterday.\"</p><p>\"That was an accident,\" he said.</p><p>\"Was it?\"</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"Nothing,\" I quickly said. Turning to face him, I added, \"Have you told anyone what happened between us yesterday?\"</p><p>No,\" he said right back. \"Who would I tell?\"</p><p>\"Your father?\"</p><p>\"Hey, dad, while you were out today, me and that pretty-looking cop drank some of your whiskey and then got it on across your kitchen table. I don't think so, do you?\" he said, cocking his eyebrow at me. \"Anyway, that wasn't what caused the accident.\"</p><p>\"I killed them,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"That cart and horse was a menace. The whole family were,\" Michael said.</p><p>\"Did you know them then?\" I asked.</p><p>\"No, not really,\" Michael said, turning away, picking up his shirt from the floor and putting it on. \"The old guy was as crazy as a loon. He talked kinda strange.\"</p> <p>I wanted to tell Michael how the old man had called me a witch, but Woody had said we all needed to be singing from the same hymn sheet, so I pushed the thought away, knowing I shouldn't discuss what happened out on the road. I just wanted to satisfy myself that Michael would keep our secret.</p><p>\"I had a nightmare about that old man last night,\" I whispered, turning to look out of the window again. The sea was glistening beneath the pale afternoon sun. \"I dreamt about all of them.\"</p><p>\"What happened is going to play on your mind for a while,\" he said.</p><p>\"They were chasing me and I fell down a well and couldn't get out,\" I explained, suddenly feeling cold. I wrapped my arms about me.</p><p>\"A well?\" Michael asked, sounding confused.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said thoughtfully, staring out at the sea. \"I guess it symbolises me falling into the massive hole I've dug for myself.\"</p><p>\"I guess,\" he said.</p><p>\"My father saved me, though, like he always does,\" I said, not knowing if I was still talking to Michael or just talking out loud in an attempt to explain it all to myself. \"Maybe my father's right and all I need is some rest?\"</p><p>\"Look, if it would make you feel better, I could always stay with you tonight,\" Michael said.</p><p>\"Thanks,\" I said, turning to smile at him. \"But I'll be okay. I just want a day or two to myself. Perhaps what we did today wasn't such a good idea after all.\"</p><p>\"Do you regret it?\" he asked, looking a little confused.</p><p>\"I don't know what I feel anymore,\" I said.</p><p>Michael came towards me, and stroking the fringe off of my forehead, he said, \"Why don't you get some rest over the next couple of days and then give me a call - if you want to, that is.\"</p><p>\"Why did you really come looking for me today?\" I asked him, looking up into his eyes.</p><p>\"Like I said, I can't get you out of my head, Officer Sydney Hart. I've never met anyone like you before - you're kinda intense.\"</p><p>\"Is that a good thing?\" I asked him.</p><p>\"I'm not sure, but I'll let you know,\" he said, smiling. He kissed me gently on the forehead and headed for the door.</p><p>With his back to me, I said, \"Where did you go?\"</p><p>\"Sorry?\" he asked, looking over his shoulder at me.</p><p>\"You said you left town ten years ago,\" I reminded him. \"Where did you go?\"</p><p>\"Into the Army. But I had enough of that life and thought it was time to come home.\" Looking me up and down, Michael added, \"And I'm so glad I did. Call me.\"</p><p>Then he was gone. I looked back out of the window and watched him disappear up the road. It was only when he was out of sight I realised I didn't have his number. Maybe that was for the best, I thought, and turned away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I spent the rest of the afternoon curled up on the sofa reading. It would have been nice to have some Adele playing in the background, but I was still unable to find my iPod anywhere and my mini iPad was too big for the dock in the corner of my room. I tried to clear my mind of the accident, my father, and Michael.</p><p>About 4 p.m., I received a call from my friend, Lisa. She didn't live in town, but some miles away in Penzance, which I was glad of today. Breathlessly she told me she had read in a local paper that Officer Sydney Hart had been involved in a car accident which had resulted in four deaths.</p><p>\"Why didn't you call to let me know what had happened?\" Lisa asked, sounding confused, hurt and worried on the other end of the phone. \"I've been trying to get you on your mobile, but the thing is switched off.\"</p><p>\"I'm okay,\" I tried to assure her.</p> <p>\"Are you hurt?\" she gasped, ignoring my attempts to calm her.</p><p>\"I'm okay,\" I told her again. \"Just a small cut on my forehead and that's about it.</p><p>\"You poor thing,\" she sighed. \"I'm going to come over.\"</p><p>\"No, don't,\" I put in. \"I'm okay, honestly.\"</p><p>\"I'll bring some wine and some...\" she started.</p> <p>\"No,\" I said again. \"I just want to be on my own for a few days. I need to figure some things out.\"</p><p>\"Well, if you're sure?\" Lisa said, sounding hurt again.</p><p>\"I'm sure,\" I said softly. \"I'm still a bit shook up about what happened. It's nothing personal, Lisa. Just give me a few days and I'll come over to Penzance for the day.\"</p><p>\"Well, you know where I am if you need me or want to chat about anything,\" she said.</p><p>\"I know,\" I whispered, wondering if I was doing the right thing by shutting people out. I knew what would happen. Lisa would come over. We'd sink a couple of bottles of wine, I would get all upset about what had happened, then probably tell her everything. I couldn't' risk that - not yet - probably not ever. The secret of what my father had done - how he had covered for me - would have to stay our secret forever - and Michael's. \"I promise I'll call you, just give me a few days.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Lisa whispered, that note of concern still in her voice.</p> <p>I hung up the phone. I got up from off the sofa and started to pace the room. Lisa had said that she'd read about the accident in the local newspaper. How had the accident been reported? I wondered. How much had been written? Was it a big story, or just a few lines on page four or five? Needing to know what had been reported about the accident I pulled on my trainers, threw on a coat, and left my apartment.</p><p>With the collar up about my throat, and head bent forward, I made my way through the small town towards the local supermarket. The streets were quiet and what few people did pass by, I wondered if they were looking at me. Most of them knew me to be Sergeant Richard Hart's daughter. Most knew me as the pisshead who had come good with the help and support of her loving father. Who could blame the young girl for getting into trouble, what, with her mother running off with a man half her age and all? I knew that's what they thought. I had heard the gossip and the rumours. I was the problem child who had been saved by my loving father. I had just been putting those things behind me - proving my worth in town by becoming a cop, when the accident happens. And now that it was in the local paper, new rumours, new lines of gossip would be created - true or untrue. What the people of the town didn't know, they simply made up. That was the problem of living in such a small place - everyone knew you and your business.</p><p>I reached the supermarket, and as quickly as I could, I took a copy of the local newspaper, placed the money on the counter, and left the store without as much as a 'Hello' or 'Goodbye'. Feeling like a criminal, and with the paper tucked under my arm, I walked as quickly as I could back to my apartment. It was now dusk, the sky turning dark overhead, making the waves that rushed the shore look more like ripples of black tar than seawater.</p><p>I turned into my street and with my head still hung low, and the collar of my coat brushing against my cheeks, I hurried towards my apartment. I was no more than a few yards away, and fishing my keys from my pocket, when I looked up to discover someone bent over against my front door. Stopping dead in my tracks, I watched from a safe distance as whoever it was opened the letterbox and peered into my apartment. In the dim light of dusk, it was hard to tell who the figure was or even if they were male or female. With their back to me, all I could see for sure was that they were dressed all in black. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Slowly, I took my police badge from the back of my jeans. The figure stood at my front door, and I watched as they slipped one of their hands into the letterbox. Wearing the black clothes, whoever they were, reminded me of the family I had killed out on the road. Was it someone related to them? I wondered, my heart skipping a beat. Had they read the article in the newspaper? Lisa had said my name had been printed in the paper. Did this person know what had really happened? Impossible, there were no witnesses. Perhaps they had come to speak with me - find out about how their relatives had died. Maybe they had come to have some kind of confrontation.</p><p>With my police badge curled in my fist, I crept up behind the figure as it withdrew its hand from my letterbox, and crouched down to peer through the narrow opening and into my apartment.</p><p>Taking a deep breath and standing behind the figure dressed all in black, I said, \"Can I help you?\"</p><p>The figure jumped up and then wheeled around to face me.</p> <p>\"Gee, you scared me half to death,\" the young man said, his eyes wide and dark.</p><p>\"What do you think you are doing?\" I snapped, staring at him. He was about my age, maybe a year or two older, but no more. He was clean-shaven with a nice face. He wasn't what you would call handsome or even good-looking, but there was something. His nose looked as if perhaps it had been broken once or twice, but it gave him a kind of rugged look. His hair was black, cut short and as dark as his eyes. He was tall, perhaps six foot or more, and his build was lean.</p><p>\"I was trying to post this through your letterbox, but it looks kind of expensive and I didn't want to break it,\" the stranger said, holding out his hand.</p><p>I looked down to see that he was holding out my iPod. \"Where did you find that?\" I asked with a frown, taking it from him.</p><p>\"You left it at the station,\" he said.</p> <p>\"At the station?\"</p><p>\"You know, the police station, where you work,\" he said, with a smile.</p><p>Eyeing him, I said, \"So if I left it at the police station, how come you have it?\"</p><p>As if reading the confusion on my face, he said, \"I'm sorry, let me explain. I'm Vincent - the new recruit. We haven't met yet. I only arrived yesterday. Fresh out of the box as some might say.\" As he spoke, he unzipped his black coat to reveal his uniform underneath. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.\"</p><p>\"No, that's okay,\" I sighed, feeling relieved that he was a fellow officer and not anyone connected to the dead members of that family.</p><p>\"Look, do you want to come in for a minute?\" I said, not wanting to stand outside in the street in case any of the townsfolk wanted to enquire how I was doing now that the news was out.</p> <p>\"A cup of tea would be great,\" Vincent smiled, rubbing his hands together as if he were cold.</p><p>\"I didn't say anything about tea,\" I half-smiled back at him and opened the door.</p><p>I took off my coat and dropped it onto the sofa with the newspaper. I would read it once Vincent had gone. Taking my iPod, I slotted it into the dock and switched it on.</p><p>\"How about playing Ho Hey by The Lumineers,\" Vincent said, glancing about the living room. \"I love that song.\"</p><p>\"How do you know I have that track?\" I asked.</p><p>\"I had a peek to see what kinda music you liked listening to,\" he smiled.</p><p>I glared back at him.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" he shrugged with another innocent-looking smile playing on his lips.</p> <p>Despite feeling a bit put out that he had been nosing through my iPod, I put on the track he had suggested. The music started to play and I turned to discover Vincent had picked up a photograph which was in a frame on top of the TV.</p><p>\"She's hot,\" he said, looking down at the picture in his hands.</p><p>\"Do you mind?\" I said, snatching the picture from him and placing it back on top of the TV. \"That happens to be my mother.\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't realise.\"</p><p>\"You really are a nosey sod, aren't you,\" I said, hands on my hips.</p><p>\"Goes with the job, doesn't it?\" he said, dropping down onto the sofa, making himself comfortable.</p><p>I stood glaring down at him.</p><p>He looked up at me, and guessing that he'd pissed me off, he got up again and said, \"I'm sorry. I'll be on my way.\"</p><p>I watched him head for the door and I felt a little guilty. He was obviously new to the job and perhaps he was just trying to be friendly. He had brought my iPod back after all.</p><p>\"Do you want that cup of tea or not?\" I said.</p><p>\"White with two sugars,\" he said with a grin stretched across his rugged face. He flopped back down onto the sofa again.</p><p>\"You just make yourself comfortable,\" I sighed and went to the kitchen.</p><p>I switched on the kettle and prepared the tea. As I worked, I called out to him and said, \"Who told you to bring my iPod over?\"</p><p>\"One of the older guys,\" I heard him say from the living room. \"I think his name was Mac. Apparently, the skipper asked him to bring it over, but Mac got called out on some job, so he asked me to drop it off here on my way home. He told me not to tell the skipper I'd brought it over.\"</p><p>I knew at once why Mac hadn't wanted my father to know he had got the newbie to bring my iPod over, as I wasn't meant to be having any contact with anyone at work until talk about the accident had died down.</p><p>\"You won't say anything to the skipper, will you?\" he said from the other room. \"I don't want to get anyone into trouble during my first few days on the job.\"</p><p>Guessing my father would give Mac a hard time, I said, \"Don't worry, I won't tell my dad that you popped by.\"</p><p>\"Your dad!\" Vincent suddenly gasped. I looked up to see him peering around the frame of the kitchen door at me. \"Your dad is the sergeant?\"</p><p>With disbelief, I looked at the cigarette which was dangling from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\"Yes, he's my father,\" I said, crossing the kitchen and snatching the half-smoked cigarette from between Vincent's lips. \"Do you mind?\" I scowled at him, pitching the cigarette out in the sink. \"I didn't say you could smoke in here.\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Vincent shrugged as if unable to see why it was such a big deal. \"I didn't think having a smoke would get your knickers in a twist.\"</p><p>\"You're a cocky sod, aren't you?\" I snapped at him.</p><p>Ignoring me, he looked at the tea I had just poured and said, \"Don't suppose you've got any biscuits to go with that? Jammy Dodgers -</p><p>I love Jammy Dodgers.\"</p><p>\"You want Jammy Dodgers, go and freaking buy some,\" I said, thrusting the cup of tea into his hands. \"There's a shop just down the road.\"</p><p>Brushing past him, I went back into the living room. Vincent followed.</p><p>\"So you're the officer in the paper,\" Vincent said, then made an annoying slurping sound as he drank the tea.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said.</p><p>Vincent reached down and plucked up the newspaper. \"You're much prettier in real life,\" he said thoughtfully.</p><p>\"There's a picture of me?\" I gasped, snatching the paper from him and thumbing through the pages.</p><p>\"Yeah, it's not a very good one,\" he said, slurping at his tea again. \"Makes you look fat.\"</p><p>I glared at him over the top of the newspaper.</p><p>\"I'm not saying you're fat,\" he said, as if realising his mistake. \"What I meant to say was that they could have chosen a better picture, that's all...\"</p><p>\"Vincent,\" I hissed at him.</p><p>\"Huh?\" he said, looking vacantly at me.</p><p>\"Do yourself a favour and shut up!\" I snapped.</p><p>\"Sure,\" he said, taking a crumpled pack of cigarettes from his coat pocket. He saw me glare down at them. Silently, he put them away again. \"Sorry, I forgot,\" he whispered back at me.</p><p>I looked down at the paper, and there on page six was a picture of me. It had been lifted from a group photo of me and the other recruits I had passed through training school with. And I didn't look fat. Local cop in traffic accident - four dead! The headline read in thick, black letters. The article was short, and described pretty much how my father had spun the facts. In fact, one part of the article read: \"...if it hadn't of been for the quick thinking of Officer Sydney Hart, then she too could have ended up dead. The driver of the horse and cart was only partially sighted and drove him and his family into the path of the officer's car while she was en route to assist colleagues...\" police spokesman Sergeant Richard Hart was reported to have said.</p><p>Was this a suicide by cop? The reporter had asked.</p><p>I don't know about that, Sergeant Hart, the police spokesman said, but to have been driving with such poor eyesight, the driver must have had a death wish.</p><p>There was little else to the article which I didn't already know. The fact that the evidence had now been passed to the local coroner's office, pending an inquest was how the report ended. Just like my father had said, a few lines and it would all be forgotten about. The world would move on.</p><p>I closed the paper, folded it, and placed it back on the sofa.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" Vincent asked, looking at me. \"You look really...really tired...worn out.\"</p><p>\"And fat?\" I glanced at him. \"You really know how to flatter a lady.\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" he said again with a shrug. \"It couldn't have been easy - you know, being caught up in an accident like that.\"</p><p>Wanting to change the subject, and heeding my father's warning, I said, \"So how are you finding being a cop?\"</p><p>\"Not as exciting as I thought it would be,\" Vincent said with a frustrated sigh.</p><p>\"Well if it's excitement and action you want, you've come to the wrong place,\" I said.</p><p>\"I didn't have a choice,\" Vincent groaned. \"This is where force headquarters posted me.\"</p><p>\"It's not so bad,\" I said. \"What has my father got you doing?\"</p><p>\"Cleaning out the property store and the filing room,\" Vincent said.</p><p>\"Wow, that is exciting,\" I smiled back at him.</p><p>\"It's okay, I guess,\" Vincent said, placing his empty cup to one side. \"Some of those old files are quite interesting.\"</p><p>\"How come?\" I asked. \"I didn't think any exciting crimes ever happened in Cliff View.\"</p><p>\"I've come across one file which seems pretty interesting,\" he said, scratching his chin.</p><p>\"Oh yeah?\" I said, trying to sound interested, but half of me just wanted to be on my own again. I turned to my iPod in its dock and thumbed through the tracks. I selected Set Fire To The Rain by Adele.</p><p>\"There was this girl who died about ten years ago,\" Vincent said as the music started. \"She fell down a well and died.\"</p><p>The mention of the word well brought a sudden flashback of the nightmare I'd had. I saw myself trapped at the bottom of that well again and screaming for help. I turned to look at Vincent, who was now checking out some of the books on the shelf attached to the living room wall. \"Black Hill Farm,\" he said thumbing through one of the books. \"I've not read that one.\"</p><p>Taking it from him and placing it back onto the shelf, I looked at Vincent and said, \"So how did this girl end up in the bottom of a well?\"</p><p>\"Some say she was being chased and she fell in,\" he said, fingering another book on the shelf.</p><p>I gripped his wrist before he had a chance to remove another one. \"Who was chasing her?\" I breathed.</p><p>\"Dunno,\" he shrugged. \"A lot of the paperwork is missing from the file. I guess that's why your father has asked me to tidy up. That file room is a right mess, I can tell you.\" Then, as if noticing the serious look on my face, Vincent added, \"Is there something wrong?\"</p><p>Letting go of his wrist, I turned away and said, \"It's nothing.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" he said, coming up behind me.</p><p>\"I'm sure,\" I said.</p><p>\"Okay.\" And I heard his coat crinkle as he shrugged again.</p><p>I turned to look at him, wanting to tell him about the nightmare I'd had. He would think I was mad, right?</p><p>Looking back at me as I stood before him, Vincent suddenly said, \"Do you want to go to bed?\"</p><p>\"What?\" I gasped, surprised by what he had said.</p><p>With his cheeks flushing scarlet, Vincent mumbled, \"Holy shit, that's not what I meant. Oh no! I wasn't like...you know...suggesting we went to bed together...nothing like that. I mean we could if you wanted...no I'm just fooling about when I say that...oh, shit I'm just making things worse, aren't I?\"</p><p>Feeling kind of embarrassed for him, and trying to mask a smile, I said, \"I think I know what you meant.\"</p><p>\"It's just like I said...you look really tired...\" Vincent continued to stammer and fluster. \"...so when I said do you want to go to bed...I didn't mean with me...I wasn't suggesting that we...you know...had jiggy-jiggy or anything like that...\"</p><p>\"Jiggy-jiggy?\" I laughed. Vincent, although a little annoying with his nosy ways, definitely had a way of making me laugh. There was a kind of endearing innocence about him. \"I've never heard it called that before.\"</p><p>\"No?\" he said with a frown. \"You know what I mean...I just meant to say that perhaps you should get some rest...have an early night...\"</p><p>\"If I were you, I'd leave now, Vincent, before you really put your foot in it,\" I smiled, guiding him towards the door.</p><p>\"Okay, you're probably right,\" he said, stumbling backwards into the edge of the sofa. I gripped him by the arm before he spilled onto the carpet. \"Thanks,\" he said, glowing scarlet again.</p><p>\"It's okay,\" I said, opening the front door.</p><p>He stepped out into the dark. It had started to rain. Zipping up the front of his coat, he said, \"It was nice meeting you, Sydney.\"</p><p>\"You too,\" I smiled, watching him set off towards the street. Before he had gone too far, I called out to him. \"Hey, Vincent!\"</p><p>\"Mm?\" he said, glancing back over his shoulder at me.</p><p>\"If you find anymore paperwork from that file, could you bring it over for me to have a look at?\" I asked.</p><p>Vincent turned to look at me. \"I don't know if that is such a great idea,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Mac made it quite clear that you were to be left alone - you know, while you get your head around what happened - the accident. I don't want to start pissing off the skipper - your father.\"</p><p>\"I promise I won't say anything if you don't,\" I hushed. \"It will be our secret.\"</p><p>Vincent looked down at the ground as if thinking, then back at me. \"Okay,\" he said. \"But the next time I come over, you better have some biscuits in.\"</p><p>\"I promise,\" I smiled.</p><p>Vincent turned away, and disappeared up the street.</p><p>I closed the door, and with my back pressed flat against it, I knew I had gone and created yet another secret. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vincent had been right. I did need to go to bed. I needed some serious sleep. Sleep undisrupted by nightmares of the people I had killed on the road. I went through my apartment, switching out the lights. Picking up my iPod, which Vincent had returned, and a set of small earphones, I went to my bedroom. I peeled off my clothes and climbed into bed. With the light from my iPod casting eerie shadows about the room, I hit the music icon with my thumb, expecting to see the album cover for Adele - 21 to appear on the screen, as that had been the track which had been playing before switching it off. I was surprised to see Sting staring back at me. The Police - Greatest Hits the screen read. I frowned, unable to remember ever downloading the album to my iPod - it was too 80's for me. Perhaps I had in some drunken stupor or perhaps Vincent had downloaded it. Would he have? Vincent admitted to searching through my iPod to see what music I liked; perhaps he had downloaded this album for a joke or something. It was The Police after all. Perhaps one of my colleagues had downloaded it? But why?</p><p>I pulled the duvet up under my chin, pressed play on my iPod, and closed my eyes. The song Message in a Bottle started to play...Just a castaway...an island lost at sea...another lonely day...with no one here but me...Sting sang. The words swam through my mind as I lay alone in my bed in the dark. Maybe whoever had downloaded the album to my iPod was trying to send me a message...I'm sending out an S.O.S...I'm sending out an S.O.S...or perhaps they were asking for my help, I wondered as the song went around and around in my head. But who would need help from someone like me? How could I help anyone else when I couldn't even help myself?</p><p>I pictured a bottle floating in water, bobbing and listing from side to side. The water was black, just like the waves which had crashed against the shore earlier that day. The water made a sploshing sound as the bottle came towards me. There was something tucked inside it. A message, perhaps? A cry for help? My feet felt suddenly cold and wet. I looked down to see that I was standing ankle-deep in a pool of dirty, black water. There was music playing in the background from far off, as if coming down a tunnel. I vaguely recognised the song but couldn't quite place it. I looked left and right expecting to see the sandy shoreline stretching away from me in both directions. I threw my hands to my face in fear. There was no sea, no sand - just thick, slimy, stone grey walls. I looked up, the funnel of the well stretching high above me, its opening looking like a pinprick of white light.</p><p>With my heart racing and mouth turning dust dry, I knew I was trapped at the bottom of the well again. Something brushed against my ankle, and I screamed. It was the bottle and there was something inside, a folded piece of paper. I reached for it, then stopped, my fingertips brushing the cold, black water. The music had suddenly grown louder. But it wasn't music - not quite. It was the sound of somebody humming behind me. Slowly, I straightened, leaving the bottle to bob about my feet. I recognised the song being hummed - Every Breath You Take by The Police. The humming was soft, and it floated around the bottom of the well like a hymn, spiralling upwards and echoing back off the moss-covered walls. My hands were covering my face, and peering through my fingers, I turned around. I wasn't alone. There was somebody standing, hidden in shadow just a few feet from me.</p> <p>\"Every breath you take...Every move you make...I'll be watching you...\" the figure sang softly.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" I whispered, shaking with fear.</p><p>Out of the shadows stepped a young woman. I didn't recognise her. She looked about eighteen years old. She had a pretty face, which was paper white. Long, straight, black hair hung against the sides of her face like curtains, and onto her shoulders. The girl wore a thin, long black dress, the hem brushing over the surface of the water at the bottom of the well. Her eyes were like dark pools as she stared at me.</p><p>\"Who are you?\" I whispered again.</p><p>\"Every vow you break...Every smile you fake...Every claim you stake...I'll be watching you,\" she sang as if in answer to my question.</p> <p>\"Watching me,\" I breathed, my teeth starting to chatter. Was I that scared or had it grown so suddenly cold? \"Why would you be watching me?\"</p><p>Opening her arms as if to embrace me, the girl took a step forwards and sung just above a whisper, \"How my poor heart aches with every step you take...\"</p><p>I flinched away, her long, white fingers looking skeletal in the darkness of the well.</p><p>\"I feel so cold and I long for your embrace...\" the girl sang softly, her arms still open, as if inviting me to hold her. She stopped singing, her lower lip trembling, tears rolling down her ashen face as she started to sob. Somehow the music continued to echo softly about the well, even though she had stopped singing and humming. And even though my mind was screaming at me to run - climb out of the well and escape - I couldn't leave her alone. The girl looked too sad. Heartbroken.</p><p>With the water lapping against my ankles, I stepped forward and took her in my arms. I held her and she hugged me back gently. No, she didn't hug me - she clung to me. Her hair felt soft against my face, her body frail and delicate in my arms.</p><p>\"Why are you crying?\" I whispered in her ear, my heart suddenly aching as if I could feel her sadness. It was more than sadness - it felt like utter despair.</p> <p>The girl sobbed against me, like a younger sister needing comfort.</p><p>\"How did you end up in this well?\" I whispered.</p><p>\"I was pushed,\" she cried against me.</p><p>\"Who pushed you?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Witch...\" she said.</p><p>But it didn't sound like the girl anymore...her voice had changed. It had grown hoarse, rough, as if she were gargling on a throat full of broken glass. I pulled away from her and screamed. It wasn't the girl I was holding in my arms, but the old man who had died on the road. Tiny bubbles of blood popped around his flaky lips. He jerked and twitched as he came towards me, his milky white eyes rolled back in their sunken sockets.</p><p>\"Witch,\" he croaked.</p><p>\"I'm not a witch!\" I screamed at him, my heart racing. \"It was an accident. I didn't mean to kill you.\"</p> <p>\"No accident...\" the old man gargled. \"Witch!\"</p><p>\"Leave me alone!\" I screamed, covering my ears with my hands, and screwing my eyes shut. \"I don't want to see you no more! Please just leave me alone.\"</p><p>Then, in time with the music, and just like the girl had, the old man started to hum, then sing that song. \"Every move you make...I'll be watching you...\"</p><p>\"Please,\" I cried, turning and beginning to claw my way up the walls of the well. My fingernails dug and scratched at the stone surface, but I couldn't get a hold. The walls were damp, covered in hundreds of years' worth of moss and mildew. I glanced back over my shoulder. The old man was standing in the water, humming that song. The flap of skin which had been torn free during the car crash hung against the side of his face, making a wet, slapping sound.</p><p>\"Please stop,\" I cried, my heart beating so fast I thought it might just break.</p><p>Despite my pleas, the old man continued to sing. That same line going around and around in my head... I'll be watching you... I'll be watching you... I'll be watching you...</p><p>...I'll be watching you! I pulled the earphones out, just wanting that song to stop, and sat up in my bed. Sweat dripped from my brow, plastering my hair to the sides of my face. A splinter of grey dawn light cut through a gap in the curtains and gave my room a dim, smoky-like quality. I looked down at my iPod; that song by The Police was stuck on repeat. With a set of trembling fingers, I turned it off. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I threw on my bathrobe and padded to the bathroom. Feeling sick and with my heart still racing, I started to run a bath. While it filled with water, I sat on the toilet and had a pee. Why had I dreamt about that girl in the well? My mind raced. Had the girl in the well been hiding away in my subconscious because Vincent had mentioned her? How had she ended up in that well? The girl in my nightmare had told me she'd been pushed. By accident or on purpose?</p><p>I turned off the taps, slipped out of my robe, and climbed into the bath. The warm water lapped over me and I leant my head back. Staring up at the white ceiling, I thought of how the girl had been humming and singing. To picture her standing at the bottom of the well, her dark eyes staring at me, made me shiver and I sunk deeper beneath the warm bath water. Why had she been singing that song - why did she say that she would be watching me? Because you fell asleep listening to that song, dummy, my mind tried to reason. That's all it was. You were listening to that Police track and the words and music filtered through your subconscious and into your dream. I splashed some of the bath water onto my face in an attempt to clear my mind.</p><p>Vincent had said that a girl had died by falling into a well ten years ago. What if it is the same girl - the same well - I had seen in my nightmare? And if it was, why? The old man was still haunting my sleep. He had been in the well, too. Was there a connection between him and the girl? Had he been involved in the girl's death in some way? Michael had told me he hadn't really known the old man, other than he was odd and spoke kinda strange. He definitely did that - calling me witch. But he only kept making a guest appearance in my dreams because of what happened out on the road, I reasoned. The old guy was my guilty conscience, come alive to haunt me. That's why he wanted to talk to me. Would he ever be silenced unless I told the truth? I feared he would always be there - lurking in the shadows of my dreams - whispering the word Witch.</p><p>Who was the girl, though? I would only find that out if Vincent found more of the missing paperwork from the file he had mentioned. I didn't have a contact number for him and I couldn't risk telephoning the police station. I couldn't let my father know that I'd been in contact with anyone from work. As my mind tried to reason out the dream and try and conjure ways of how I might find out who the girl was and why she came to be in that well, the telephone suddenly rang. With water dripping from me, I climbed out of the bath, wrapped a clean towel around me, and went into the living room.</p> <p>\"Hello,\" I said into the phone.</p><p>\"Sydney, it's your father,\" he said.</p><p>My heart leapt into my throat. Had he discovered that it hadn't been Mac who'd returned my iPod, and that I had spoken with the new recruit, Vincent? \"Hey, dad,\" I said casually.</p><p>\"I just called to see how you were doing?\" he said.</p><p>I swallowed hard with relief. \"Okay, I guess.\"</p> <p>\"You guess?\" my father came back. \"Are you okay, or not?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sleeping too good,\" I confessed, wanting to share my burden. I wondered how his sleep had been. Had his conscience been pricking him too as he lay alone at night? Somehow I doubted it. \"I keep having nightmares.\"</p><p>\"They'll soon pass,\" he said, more like a doctor giving medical advice than a father offering comfort.</p><p>\"I'm not so sure,\" I said softly, looking out of the living room window at the grey day. \"I don't think they will ever go away unless I tell the truth about what really happened. How those people really died.\"</p><p>I heard my father breathe deeply on the other end of the line. \"Sydney, that time has passed. We can't go back on our story now.\"</p><p>\"But...\" I started.</p> <p>\"Listen to me, Sydney,\" he cut in, \"there isn't going to be a problem here unless you create one. The paperwork has been sent over to the coroner's office. As far as everyone thinks, it was a regrettable accident caused by the old guy, who was half blind, steering his horse and cart out into the road in front of your patrol car.\"</p><p>\"But that's a lie, dad,\" I breathed. \"That's not what happened and you know it - I know it.\"</p><p>\"Look, if you start to wobble now, girl, the whole thing will go belly-up,\" he warned. \"But it won't just be you who will be in the dock; it will be Mac, Woody, and me. Both of them are good men, with wives and children. Do you want to see them lose their jobs? Or worse, go to prison for perverting the course of justice? Because that's what will happen, Sydney - that's what will happen to all of us.\"</p><p>\"But...\" I tried to start again.</p><p>\"I understand how you feel,\" my father said down the line, his voice taking on a calmer tone as if trying to reason with me. \"However you want to look at it, Sydney, you didn't mean to kill those people. It was a mistake, right?\"</p><p>\"Right,\" I whispered, closing my eyes and picturing that little boy with the red sticky hair.</p><p>\"A mistake you would have to pay for with the rest of your life if the truth ever came out that you had been drinking on duty, which resulted in the death of those people,\" he reasoned with me.</p><p>\"I get the feeling I'm going to pay for it anyway,\" I whispered into the phone.</p> <p>\"Maybe,\" he said. \"But it will be a darn-sight more comfortable dealing with your guilt from the comfort of your apartment than a prison cell. Think about that, Sydney. You wouldn't cope with life on the inside. I've seen it. Those people live like animals. They'd eat you up for breakfast and spit you out for supper, especially being a copper and all.\" He paused, then added, \"Can't you see I'm just trying to protect you?\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I said softly, but the feelings of guilt felt just as raw as ever.</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>\"Why don't you go and see your mum for a few days?\" he suddenly suggested. \"The change of scenery will do you good. You know, get right away from Cliff View. You might even decide that you want to stay...\"</p><p>\"You want to get rid of me?\" I breathed, feeling crushed at his suggestion. \"You don't want me to come back because I'm an embarrassment to you. I cause you problems and always have.\"</p><p>\"That's not what I meant,\" he said. \"What I'm trying to say is, you might decide there is a better life for you in Spain. Let's be honest - what's there to offer you in Cliff View? You're always telling me that there is no life down here - that you don't really have any friends. All I'm trying to say is that you might have a more interesting life over there with your mum...\"</p><p>\"And Julio?\" I snapped, wanting to hurt him as much as he had hurt me.</p><p>There was another long silence at the mention of my mum's lover's name.</p><p>Almost at once, I regretted what I had said. My father didn't deserve that. Trying to make amends, I said, \"I don't want to go to Spain. If I had wanted to, I would've gone already. I want to stay in Cliff View - it's my home...and I don't want to leave you.\"</p><p>Ignoring my last comment, my father said, \"It's up to you, Sydney, if you want to stay, then get a grip. This thing will pass in time. If you need me, you know where I am.\"</p><p>The phone line went dead. I replaced the receiver, knowing that I'd pissed off my father - again. Still hurting at his suggestion that I go and live in Spain, I wanted to prove to him that I wasn't the screw-up he took me for. I wanted to show my father that I could do something worthwhile in life for once - that I could make a difference. And I knew how I might do that. Dream, nightmare, or premonition - I couldn't rid myself of the feeling that perhaps the girl in my nightmare and the old guy were somehow connected. Perhaps he had pushed her down the well? If I could somehow prove that, then it would go a long way of relieving some of my own guilt and show my father that I could be a good cop after all.</p><p>But where was the well? If the old man was in some way connected then it would have to be close, if not in the town of Cliff View itself. How would I find it? With no way of contacting Vincent, I would have to rely on my own policing - detective - skills. With the towel still wrapped tightly about me, I plucked up my iPad. Sitting on the edge of the sofa, I typed 'wells - disused wells - cliff view - Cornwall - England' into the search engine. Within moments, I was shown a list of results. The third link on the list read: Cliff View Heritage Association. I tapped the link with my finger to reveal a website run by the local council. It had been designed to attract tourists to the local town and area. There were a few pages of postcard-type pictures showing off the local beaches, hills, and valleys, but there was also a page with old ordinance survey maps. I clicked to this page. The map showed the locations of fountains, signal posts, pathways, disused railway lines, and old wells. The map also contained historical notes on the areas concerned. Dragging the tip of my finger over the map of the town and surrounding area, there were only three wells that I could find. All three of them were located outside of town and on farms in the surrounding areas. Two of them were described as nothing more now than ruins, and the well I had seen in my nightmare, although disused, still appeared to be intact. The third and most likely to be the one I had dreamt about sat on the edge of Michael's father's farm.</p><p>I looked up from my iPad. I remembered telling Michael I'd dreamt about falling into a well, and he had seemed a little confused by this. He hadn't mentioned then that there was a well located on the farm where he lived with his father. Why would he? I'd only been talking about a dream, after all. Don't lots of people dream from time to time that they are falling down holes, off buildings, and cliff edges? Maybe there was no connection for Michael to make. What did I really know about any of this? Was the girl I had seen in my dream even connected to the girl who Vincent had said had fallen into a well? And even if she was, it didn't mean it was the well on Michael's farm. But there was one similarity between what Michael and Vincent had told me. The girl had fallen into a local well ten years ago, which was about the same time Michael had left Cliff View to join the Army. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Over a light breakfast of tea and toast, I studied the map I had found on the website. There was a coastal path which led from the town and up towards Michael's father's farm and the well. It was remote and I was unlikely to bump into anyone from town if I took that particular route in search of the well. If I could find it, then I would know for sure if it was the one I had seen in my nightmares. If it wasn't, then it was nothing more than a simple nightmare brought on by the upset of the recent accident I had been involved in. If it was the same well, then...then I wasn't sure after that.</p><p>I threw on a sweater, jeans, boots, and a warm coat. Dragging my hair back into a ponytail, I fixed it in a knot at the base of my neck. I snatched up my iPod and earphones, took the torch from my police belt, and left my apartment in search of the well. I made my way down onto the beach, the wind blowing hard and sand stinging my face like needlepoints. I bent low, the sound of the roaring wind and waves crashing against the shore. Reaching the grassy dunes where Michael had appeared the day before, I made my way across them and found the path I had seen on the map. Once off the beach, and sheltered by a crop of trees to my right, the wind didn't feel so harsh against me. I still walked bent forward, my hands thrust into my coat pockets to keep them warm. With my thumb, I switched on my iPod, wanting some music to keep me company on the long walk to the well. Without being able to see the track I was selecting, I hoped for the best. As long as it wasn't anything by The Police. Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen started to play.</p><p>I threw a wish in the well...Carly started to sing. I rolled my eyes. Did every song I listened to lately have to appear to have some relevance to the shit I had gotten myself into? I continued along the solitary path towards the well. It wound upwards, along the cliff edges and high above the shore. Fields stretched away from me on my left, desolate-looking barns and farmhouses with smoke tumbling from their chimneys in the distance. How nice it would feel to be sitting in front of a roaring fire, a mug of tea warming my hands. I pushed those thoughts from my mind, and knew I would have to wait until I could feel warm again. The path wound its way through a crop of dense trees. I pulled out my iPod and brought up the map. I could see that I wasn't too far now from the well. I turned off the music, placed the iPod back into my pocket, and followed the path through the trees. Birds, startled by my presence, fluttered from the branches overhead, the sound of their beating wings like gunshots in the eerie silence. Twigs crunched underfoot and soggy brown leaves stuck to my boots in a pulpy mush. I looked up and just ahead, I could see the well. To see it, made me stop in my tracks. With my heart starting to speed up, I stood and looked at the circular grey stone well, which stood out of the ground at about waist height. Taking a deep breath, my mind threw up visions of the girl at the bottom of the well humming along to Every Breath You Take. She wouldn't be there though, she was just a part of my dream and not real. What about the old guy? Would he be down there? Would he be looking up at me, that flap of skin slapping against his emaciated face, as he whispered up at me, \"Witch.\"</p><p>There was only one way of finding out. Very slowly, I placed one foot in front of the other and made my way through the trees to the well. I listened intently for any sound - humming, singing, or whispering, but all I could hear was the sound of the wind, my own shallow breathing, and the snap of twigs beneath my boots. Within touching distance of the well, I stopped. I looked about. The well was at the top of a small hill. To my right I could see the road which led to Michael's farm - the road where I had killed those people. On my left and through the trees I could see the farmhouse itself. From where I stood, it looked small and squat, tired and old. Its black slate roof glimmered wetly in the drizzle which had now started to fall. Apart from the barn with the busted lock, I could see another nearby. From my vantage point on top of the hill, this barn didn't look as worn down as the one Michael's father had claimed to have been broken into.</p> <p>Sensing that I was alone, I turned my attention back to the well. From where I was standing, I couldn't tell if it was the well I had seen in my dreams or not. I had never seen it from this viewpoint; I had always been at the bottom of it. But there was something familiar. Hadn't I been lost in a small crop of trees the very first time I had dreamt about it? Hadn't I been chased through trees, where I had fallen backwards down into the well? With gooseflesh scampering down my back, over my arms and legs, I stepped towards the edge of the well. Half expecting to see the girl, the old man or both staring up at me from the bottom, I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath. With my heart pounding in my ears, and legs feeling like jelly, I dared to open my eyes and peer down into the well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was dark inside. I couldn't even see the bottom. Taking my torch from my pocket, I switched it on. Casting a beam of white light into the well, I saw the grey stone walls. Were they the same walls I had seen in my dream? I couldn't be sure. They were covered in slimy green patches of moss, but what did that mean? Wouldn't all dank, dark wells be covered in the stuff? I listened intently. Was there any sound which I could connect to my nightmare? All I could hear was the Plink! Plink! Plink! of dripping water. I splashed the light from my torch down the length of the walls. It was so dark inside; even with the glow from my torch it was difficult to see anything. I pressed my legs flat against the side of the well. I leaned forward so my top half was hanging over the lip, my arm dangling out before me, hand gripping the torch. Something glistened back at me. What was it? Was there someone in the bottom? Was it the girl? The old man?</p><p>With my heart in my throat, I leant forward further still, aiming the cone of light from my torch into the bottom of the well. Screwing my eyes almost shut, I peered into the gloom. There was water, black, dark and oily-looking at the bottom. I had been standing in a foot of water in my nightmare. Hang on - there was something! The torchlight reflected off it as it moved from side to side at the bottom of the well. With my heart racing and beginning to feel sick with dread, I knew I had found the well - the well I had fallen into in my nightmare - the well with the singing girl and whispering man at the bottom of it. Bobbing to and fro in the black water at the bottom was the bottle I had seen in my dream, and it looked as if there was a folded piece of paper inside.</p><p>A hand gripped my shoulder and I screamed. I gripped the edge of the well with my free hand. My scream echoed down into the deep hole and back again, sounding shrill and ear-piercing. I span around, holding my torch high above my head like a weapon and looked straight into the face of Michael.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" he asked, looking surprised to see me.</p> <p>\"What the freaking hell are you doing?\" I gasped, my voice still sounding high-pitched and frightened. \"You scared the hell out of me!\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" he said, placing a hand on my shoulder as if to calm me. \"What are you doing all the way out here?\"</p><p>What could I say? I've been having nightmares about a girl who sings Police songs while trapped at the bottom of a well? I didn't think so. So, I said, \"I was getting tired of sitting at home and staring at the four walls.\"</p><p>\"So you thought you'd like some company,\" Michael said, taking me by the hand and guiding me away from the well.</p><p>\"I guess,\" I said, smiling at him.</p> <p>\"You're freezing,\" he said, rubbing my hand in his. \"Let's go and warm you up.\"</p><p>\"I know your idea of warming me up,\" I half-smiled at him.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" he said, winking back at me, \"the old man's at home. There's always the barn?\"</p><p>\"A nice hot mug of tea would be just fine,\" I smiled back.</p><p>\"Sure?\" he said, looking a little disappointed.</p><p>Michael led me down the hill. I looked back, wondering what was in that bottle. I couldn't help but feel confused, as I had dreamt about it. If the bottle, with its folded piece of paper tucked inside, was real, then wasn't the girl, too? Maybe Michael did know something about her? After all, she had died on his father's farm. I wanted to ask him about her, but not in front of his father. So as we passed by the barn, I pulled Michael towards it.</p> <p>With his thick, dark curls blowing about the sides of his face in the wind, and his green eyes twinkling, he smiled at me and let me lead him inside. Michael pushed the door closed with the heel of his boot. The barn was warm inside, and bales of hay lay scattered about the dusty floor. No sooner had the door been shut, when Michael folded me in his arms and kissed me. This hadn't been the reason why I'd wanted him alone, but the feel of his lips against mine felt so good, that it was impossible not to kiss him back. As we kissed, Michael ran his hands down the back of my coat and squeezed my arse with his strong hands, pulling my hips against him. He guided me towards a pile of the hay and eased me down into it. It felt soft and warm beneath me. He pulled my coat open, his eyes never leaving mine, a smile playing on his lips. I closed my eyes and felt his hands fumble open the button which held my jeans up. Once open, he slipped his hand inside, and I felt the tips of his fingers brush over me. His touch excited me as much as ever, but I just couldn't get the images of that well and that girl out of my mind. I tried to relax, but couldn't. I gently took hold of Michael's wrist and pulled his hand free of my jeans. He looked up at me, that smile spreading across his handsome face.</p><p>\"You want to be in charge again?\" he whispered excitedly.</p><p>\"No,\" I whispered back, refastening the button on my jeans.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" he asked, leaning over me as if to kiss me again. \"Is this another game?\"</p><p>\"No, Michael,\" I said. \"I just want to talk.\"</p><p>With a cocked eyebrow, he looked down at me as I lay on my back beneath him. \"This sounds serious.\"</p><p>\"It's not serious,\" I said, pulling myself up onto my elbows, straw covering me and my coat. \"Or at least I don't think it is.\"</p><p>Michael rolled onto his side next to me, resting his head on his hand. \"What's wrong, Sydney?\" he asked, sounding concerned.</p> <p>Sitting up and folding my coat about me, I took a deep breath and said, \"Do you remember I told you I'd had a nightmare about falling into a well?\"</p><p>\"I think so,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"It's just that I had another nightmare about the same well,\" I said, looking at him. \"But this time there was a girl in the well. She was crying. She told me she had been pushed...\"</p><p>\"It was just a nightmare,\" he said with a gentle laugh, as if trying to ease my mind.</p><p>\"I'm not so sure...\" I whispered, now looking away from him, scared I might make myself look like a fool. With my eyes fixed on the opposite barn wall and the tools and rope which hung from it, I added, \"I think she died in that well...the well on this farm.\"</p><p>Michael didn't say anything. He didn't try and laugh my idea away like he'd done just moments before. Slowly, I turned my head to face him again. Michael was now sitting up and staring back at me. I couldn't be sure if it was the light inside the barn, but his face appeared to have drained of all colour. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"What's wrong, Michael?\" I breathed.</p><p>\"There was a girl who died in that well,\" he said, standing and brushing straw from the seat of his trousers.</p><p>Hearing this, my heart started to beat faster. \"Who was she?\"</p><p>\"She was one of those people my father called the 'witches,'\" he said, the sparkle in his eyes now gone.</p> <p>Hearing this I leapt up, the sudden realisation that both the girl and the old man were connected, felt like a blow to my stomach. \"What was her name?\" I asked, drawing breath.</p><p>\"Molly Smith, I think it was,\" he said, averting my stare. I got the sudden feeling that he was keeping something from me.</p><p>\"What aren't you telling me, Michael?\" I said, going to him.</p><p>\"There's really nothing to tell,\" he said.</p><p>\"So how did she end up in that well?\" I pushed, my police instincts coming back. I didn't want to make him feel like he was under some kind of interrogation.</p> <p>\"It was an accident,\" he said, now looking at me, meeting my stare. \"She fell in. Look, those people were always coming onto our land, breaking things and taking anything which wasn't nailed down. She shouldn't have even been on our land. If she hadn't had been trespassing that night, then she would have never fallen into the well in the first place.\"</p><p>\"What night?\" I asked him.</p><p>\"I can't remember exactly what night,\" he said. \"It was about ten years ago.\"</p><p>\"Before or after you left for the Army?\" I quizzed him.</p><p>\"What is this?\" he said, sounding confused and hurt. \"I know you're a copper, but there is no need to treat me like a criminal. I haven't done anything wrong.\"</p><p>Seeing the hurt in his eyes, I looked away and said, \"I'm sorry. I'm a bit freaked out, that's all. I mean, how come I'm dreaming about a girl who died in a well ten years ago, and whose father I killed a few days ago?\"</p> <p>\"You're a cop, right?\" Michael said, taking my hand in his again. \"Perhaps you heard someone mention it at work or something, and it's played on your mind. You're gonna be stressed out because of the accident the other day. Your brain is just putting two and two together and coming up with five.\"</p><p>I remembered how I'd heard of the girl dying in the bottom of the well from Vincent last night. So maybe Michael was right, it had stuck in my subconscious somewhere and crept back out again while I slept. Maybe it was nothing more than that. \"I'm just spooking myself, aren't I?\" I said, looking at him. I wondered if I said that to convince Michael more than myself.</p><p>\"Look, why don't I take you home,\" he said, wrapping one of his muscular arms about me. \"Have a nice warm bath, relax, and get a good night's sleep? You'll feel so much better for it. I could stay with you if you like.\"</p><p>\"I thought I was meant to be getting some sleep?\" I half joked.</p><p>\"I didn't mean it like that,\" Michael said. \"I'll stay with you, keep you company - keep you safe from the nightmares.\"</p><p>Looking at him, I gently stroked the side of his face with my hand and said, \"Thanks, Michael, but this is something I need to sort through myself.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" he smiled, taking my hand and kissing it gently. \"Whatever you think is best.\"</p><p>Michael led me from the barn and towards the farmhouse. It had grown dark outside, and I could see the warm orange glow of lights burning from inside. There was an old 4X4 parked out front, its thick tyres clogged with mud. Michael went to the driver's side. As I passed in front of the vehicle, I noticed a large dent to the front offside and scratches where paint was missing.</p> <p>\"Had an accident?\" I asked, climbing into the passenger seat.</p><p>\"My father had a knock the other day. Hit a wall of something,\" Michael said as he started the engine and drove the vehicle away from the farm.</p><p>The 4X4 lurched and bounced onto the narrow roads. I remembered taking the same road as I raced away from the farm in my patrol car just a few days before. As we passed the field surrounding the farm, I glanced up at the hill were the well stood, hidden by the crop of trees. The girl said she had been pushed, but Michael said she had fallen. I pictured the well and the waist-high wall which surrounded it. How would anyone trip over that and fall into the well? I wondered. What of the bottle and the folded piece of paper? That had been in my dream, too, but Vincent hadn't mentioned that.</p><p>Pulling my coat around me, I settled back into my seat and tried not to think about it. Michael steered the vehicle along the stretch of road where I had driven into the horse and cart and its passengers. The headlights lit up the road, and in their glare, I could see the tyre marks running diagonally across the tarmac, but that was all that was left. There was no horse and cart, and there were no more dead people. Apart from the tyre marks I had left behind, no one would have never known what had happened there. My father had done a good job at clearing it all away. As Michael drove past the scene of the accident, I closed my eyes and remembered hearing the sound of my father's patrol car approaching from the distance. I was looking through the cracked windscreen of my upturned car, the word ECILOP across the bonnet, looking wrinkled through the web of cracks.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" Michael asked me.</p><p>I opened my eyes. He was glancing sideways at me, that look of concern in his eyes again.</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" I lied, turning and looking back at my own reflection in the car door window.</p><p>We drove the rest of the way back to my apartment in silence. Michael brought the vehicle to a stop just outside. He left the engine rumbling and purring like a giant lion. He looked at me and said, \"Are you sure you don't want some company?\"</p><p>\"I'm sure,\" I smiled weakly and reached for the door handle.</p><p>Michael gently took hold of my arm. \"When you're feeling a bit better about things, how about you and me go someplace - you know, somewhere nice - away from here?\"</p><p>\"I'd like that,\" I said back.</p><p>\"Okay then, that's a date\" he smiled. Leaning out of his seat, he kissed me softly on the lips.</p><p>Without saying another word, I climbed from the 4X4 and headed towards my front door. Michael pulled away from the curb. I glanced back and watched the rear lights disappear into the distance. Alone again, I turned towards my front door and stopped. The door was open and I could hear movement from inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With my torch held against my shoulder as if it were my police baton, I pushed open the door and crept inside. There was a light coming from beneath the living room door. I could hear the sound of voices talking. One was male, the other female. And although I recognised them, I couldn't place who those voices belonged to. With my knuckles glowing white as I gripped the end of the torch, I inched my way silently towards the living room door. Taking a deep breath, and with my heart thumping, I pushed the door open with the tip of my boot and stepped inside. Vincent looked up from the armchair in front of the T.V. and smiled.</p><p>\"Hey, Sydney,\" he said with a smile.</p><p>At first I was too lost for words to reply as I stood and stared at him in disbelief. He sat with his feet propped on the coffee table, legs crossed at the ankles. There was a cup of tea and a half-eaten cheese and pickle sandwich on the table next to his feet. He had taken off his police jacket, which was now hanging over the back of the chair. The voices I had heard from outside was that of Dana Scully and Fox Mulder as Vincent sat watching an episode of the X-Files on the Sci-Fi channel. That's where I knew those voices from.</p><p>Lowering my torch, I strode over to the T.V. and turned it off.</p> <p>\"Oh, Sydney, c'mon,\" Vincent groaned. \"What did you go and do that for? I haven't seen that episode before.\"</p><p>Ignoring him, I wheeled round and hissed, \"How did you get in here?\"</p><p>\"The front door was ajar,\" he said, dark eyes looking at me innocently. \"I came by, found the door was open, wondered if you were okay, and so thought it best if I checked to make sure there wasn't a problem. You could have been burgled for all I knew.\"</p><p>\"I never left my front door open,\" I snapped at him. Had I?</p><p>\"You musta done,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Even if I had, what gives you the right to help yourself to my food, tea, and T.V?\" I barked, slapping his feet from off the coffee table.</p><p>\"I was starving hungry,\" Vincent said. \"I hadn't eaten all day so I thought...\"</p><p>\"Food isn't the only thing you've helped yourself to, is it?\" I snapped at him, yanking my iPod from my coat pocket.</p><p>He looked at the iPod with a guilty expression.</p><p>\"Did you download The Police to my iPod?\" I shouted.</p><p>\"Oh that,\" he grimaced. \"Sorry, but it was a long walk from the police station over to here yesterday and I felt like listening to some music, and...\"</p> <p>\"So you thought you would just go and download some tunes to listen to?\" I gasped at his nerve. \"You do know that costs money, don't you?\"</p><p>\"Oh, sure,\" Vincent said, standing up and rummaging through his work trouser pockets. \"I've got a fiver here somewhere.\"</p><p>\"Stick your fiver where the sun don't shine,\" I snapped at him. \"You've got a bloody cheek coming in here and helping yourself to my food and...\"</p><p>\"How about I make you a nice cup of tea?\" he cut over me with a beaming smile. \"You look really stressed.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I am stressed thanks to you!\" I snapped at him.</p><p>\"Because of me?\" he said, looking dumbfounded. \"What have I done?\"</p><p>\"I thought I'd been freaking burgled!\" I roared, half of me just wanting to leap across the room and throttle him.</p><p>\"But I'm not a burglar,\" he frowned.</p> <p>\"You just don't get it, do you?\" I cried.</p><p>Vincent looked at me, a blank expression pulled down over his rugged face, then said, \"How many sugars?\"</p><p>\"I give up,\" I sighed, dropping my iPod into the armchair and heading for the bathroom.</p><p>\"Where you going?\" he called after me.</p><p>\"To the toilet,\" I hissed, when all I wanted to do was scream in frustration.</p><p>I slammed the bathroom door shut, pulled down my trousers and panties, and sat on the toilet. What a freaking nerve! I thought. How dare he just come into my flat and make himself at home. I didn't even know him. If it wasn't for the fact he was a copper, I would've kicked his arse out of here by now. And the iTunes thing! How dare he download...</p><p>Suddenly, I heard the sound of music coming from the living room and it was loud - very loud. Boom! Boom! Boom! Came a deep, heavy bass. The very walls of my flat began to vibrate and tremble.</p><p>\"What the fu...!\" I started, jumping up from off the toilet and struggling to pull up my clothes.</p><p>I yanked open the bathroom door and raced into the living room. At the door, I stopped and looked in sheer bewilderment. Vincent was dancing - if you could call it that - in the middle of my living room to The Time by The Black Eyed Peas. I looked incredulously as Vincent danced with an imaginary microphone pressed to his lips and sang along to the music.</p><p>\"I had the time of my life...And I never felt this way before...And I swear this is true...And I owe it all to you...Dirty bit...\"</p><p>The music started to pound all around me as Vincent started to sway his arms in the air and jiggle his butt as he danced along to the thumping music.</p><p>\"All these girls they like my swagger...\" Vincent wailed over the music, his butt sticking out and swaying from side to side. \"...They callin' me Mick Jagger...I be rollin' like a stone...jet setter...jet lagger...\"</p><p>Fastening my jeans, I raced across the living room and switched off my iPod which Vincent had dropped into the dock.</p><p>\"'Cause I'm havin' a good time with you...\" Vincent continued to wail, his eyes shut, invisible microphone in his hand. \"I'm tellin' you...\" he suddenly trailed off suddenly realising the music had come to an abrupt end. Slowly, Vincent opened his eyes and looked at me.</p><p>\"Have you lost your fucking mind?\" I roared at him. \"You're gonna piss the neighbours off!\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Vincent shrugged like a schoolboy who had been caught having a sly smoke. \"I thought it would be nice to have some background music...\"</p><p>\"Background music!\" I cried. \"The whole freaking town could hear it!\"</p><p>\"I didn't mean to have it on so loud. I couldn't figure out how to turn the sound down...\" he started to explain.</p><p>\"You didn't look as if you were doing much figuring out from what I could see,\" I said. \"You looked like you were throwing some kinda fit. What is wrong with you?\"</p><p>\"I got caught up in the moment,\" Vincent said. \"Besides, when I saw the name of the track on your iPod-thingy, I thought it was going to be that love song.\"</p><p>\"What love song?\" I quizzed with a frown.</p><p>\"You know the one...\" he trailed off as if deep in thought. \"What was it called...oh, God I can't remember now. It was sung by that woman Jennifer Warnes and...what was his name...you know...that old git with long, grey hair and...\"</p><p>\"Bill Medley,\" I cut in.</p><p>\"Yeah, that's the guy,\" Vincent said. \"Anyway, I thought it was gonna be that song...you know something nice and romantic...\"</p><p>With a frown I looked at Vincent and said, \"Why would you want to listen to romantic music...there's only the two of us here.\"</p><p>\"Romantic? Did I say romantic?\" Vincent blushed. \"What I meant to say was something nice and relaxing because you feel stressed out. I was just thinking of you...I mean, you're right...why would we want to listen to romantic music together...I mean...we could if you wanted to...no...oh, God...this is getting kinda embarrassing...how many sugars do you take in your tea?\" Vincent said, rushing away from me and into the kitchen.</p><p>I watched him go. He was the strangest guy I had ever met. He was certainly odd, but in a charming way. He took the piss by constantly helping himself to my stuff and interfering, but he had a sweet - innocent quality. Something I hadn't often - if ever - come across in the men I'd met before. I got the impression that he liked me but was way too shy or clumsy to just come out and say it. Not like Michael. Michael had made his feelings known straight off. Vincent, on the other hand, got all tongue-tied and embarrassed. Now I felt kind of guilty for having to moan at him. He'd obviously been looking for something romantic to listen to on my iPod, but had completely made a mess of it. Vincent seemed to put his mouth into gear before his brain, as I remembered the comment he had made the night before about wanting to go to bed.</p><p>Endeared by his blundering attempts to romance me - if that was truly what he was trying to do - I went and stood in the kitchen doorway and watched him pour two cups of tea. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Just the one for me,\" I said, leaning against the doorframe.</p><p>\"Mm?\" Vincent said, a spoonful of sugar hovering over a cup full of tea.</p><p>\"One sugar,\" I said, my voice losing some of the frostiness for him.</p><p>\"Sweet enough, are you?\" he said with a smile.</p> <p>\"Why do you keep saying all this stuff?\" I asked, taking the cup and stirring it contents with a spoon. \"Are you trying to flirt with me?\"</p><p>\"Who, me?\" he said, sounding surprised.</p><p>\"Who else would I be talking about?\" I said, placing the spoon in the sink and taking a sip of the tea.</p><p>\"I don't s'pose you remembered to get some biscuits,\" he said, changing the subject.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" I said. \"I just haven't had a chance. I've been too busy...\"</p> <p>\"Good job I remembered then,\" he beamed, brushing past me and heading back to the living room.</p><p>I followed. He went to his coat, which hung from the back of the armchair, and took something from the pocket.</p><p>\"Jammie Dodgers,\" he smiled, holding up a packet of biscuits.</p><p>Vincent sat down and opened the packet of biscuits, dunking one of them into his hot tea. Looking up at me as he munched happily away, he said, \"Sorry, Sydney, would you like a biscuit?\"</p><p>\"No, thanks,\" I said, taking a seat on the sofa opposite him. I sat and watched him. \"You never answered my question.\"</p><p>\"Huh?\" he said, glancing up at me.</p> <p>\"Never mind, it's not important,\" I said with a shake of my head. \"So to what do I owe the pleasure of your company?\"</p><p>\"Oh yes, I was forgetting,\" he said, placing his cup and biscuit onto the small coffee table in front of him. The light from the lamp in the corner made the numbers on his epaulettes shine brightly. I could see that his police collar number was 5013. Vincent reached inside his jacket and pulled out a beige coloured file. \"You said to let you know if I found any more paperwork on that girl who died at the bottom of the well.\"</p><p>I looked at the file and my nerve endings started to tingle. Vincent crossed the room, sat next to me on the sofa, and opened the file.</p><p>\"There isn't a great deal to go on,\" he said, taking out a piece of paper. \"The file room back at the station is a real mess. I'll carry on looking, though.\"</p><p>\"So what have you found?\" I asked him, eyeing the piece of paper he held in his hand.</p><p>\"A letter from the deceased father,\" Vincent said.</p><p>\"That was the old guy who died out on the road the other day,\" I breathed, my stomach beginning to clench up.</p><p>\"His name was Jonathan Smith,\" Vincent said, looking down at the letter which he held.</p> <p>To hear the old man's name for the first time made me feel queasy. It made what I had done seem more real somehow. I could no longer just think of him as an old man - a nobody - as my father had described him. This man had a name. He had been a real person - not just a ghost who haunted my dreams.</p><p>\"What's the letter about?\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Okay, so it was his eighteen-year-old daughter, Molly, who fell into the well,\" Vincent explained.</p><p>That was the name Michael had told me.</p><p>\"Her father, Jonathan Smith, wasn't convinced that his daughter's death was an accident,\" Vincent continued.</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked, looking down at the letter then at Vincent again.</p><p>\"Read the letter for yourself,\" he said, handing it to me. \"It was written to the station sergeant at the time. His name was Skrimshire.\"</p><p>\"He's now the inspector at Penzance,\" I said, taking the letter from Vincent. The sheet of paper was dog-eared and old. The writing across it was a spidery-scrawl, but legible. It seemed odd to be reading something which had once been held by the man I had killed, and my heart began to quicken. I took a shallow breath and began to read.</p><p>15th February 2003</p><p>Sergeant Skrimshire,</p><p>I write concerning the tragic death of my daughter, Molly Smith, who was found at the bottom of the well on the Grayson farm two nights ago.</p><p>Unlike what has been reported by you to the local press, I do not believe my daughter's death to have been an accident. It has been a suspicion of mine that my daughter had been in some kind of a relationship with a local man. Although my daughter never said who, I knew that she intended to end this relationship, as we were to move away from the area because of hostilities shown to us recently by members of the local community.</p><p>Unlike firmly held beliefs by some residents of Cliff View, neither me nor any other members of my small family are criminals. Despite what has been reported in the local press, my daughter was not trespassing on the Grayson land to steal or commit any other type of crime the night she died.</p><p>It is my belief that my daughter had arranged to meet this man to discuss their relationship, during which time an argument occurred which resulted in my daughter being pursued and then pushed into the well to silence her. The fact that police also saw my daughter walking along the Buckmore Road...</p><p>\"Where is the rest of the letter?\" I asked Vincent, holding out my hand.</p><p>\"Missing,\" he said, taking the piece of paper from me and placing it back into the file. \"Or at least I can't find the rest of it. But I have found some more paperwork which I thought you might find interesting.\"</p><p>\"How come?\" I quizzed.</p><p>\"Okay,\" Vincent said, taking several more sheets of paper from the file. \"You'll notice that at the end of Jonathan Smith's letter he mentioned that police had seen his daughter walking along the Buckmore Road.\"</p><p>\"Okay?\" I said, trying to figure out where he was going with this.</p><p>\"Well, there were four officers crewed up in a van that night out on patrol,\" he said, looking at me. \"One of them was your father. He was still a constable at the time. He was one of the officers who saw Molly Smith walking along the road that night.\" Handing me some sheets of the paperwork, he added, \"This was your father's statement.\"</p><p>I took the paperwork from him, which had gone an off-white colour with age. Across the top of the first piece of paper, written in thick black ink, were the words: WITNESS STATEMENT. Just below this was my father's name and signature. Holding my father's statement in both hands, and feeling as if I were spying on him, I read what he had written all those years ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>WITNESS STATEMENT</p><p>Police Constable Richard Hart. 14th February 2003.</p><p>I am currently employed as a police constable at Cliff View Police Station, Blake Road, Cliff View, Cornwall. On Thursday the 13th February 2003, I was on duty and in company with Police Constable McDonald, Police Constable Woodland, and Police Constable Lee. About 22:00 hours, myself and the above mentioned officers started our nightshift. At 22:30 hours we were crewed in police vehicle Romeo 45, which is a marked police van. We left Cliff View Police Station and went on patrol for the evening. There had been a spate of burglaries on local farms, so we had been tasked by Sergeant Skrimshire to undertake high profile patrols in the surrounding area, to act as a deterrent, and to offer the public reassurance.</p><p>About 23:05 hours the same day, we were on patrol on the Buckmore Road, Cliff View, Cornwall. Constable Lee was driving. The road was dark as there is no street lighting along that particular stretch of road, and it was raining, so visibility was poor. I was sitting in the passenger seat next to Constable Lee, and Constables MacDonald and Woodland were both seated in the back. Suddenly Constable Lee swerved the vehicle away from the curb and braked sharply.</p> <p>\"I nearly hit that girl,\" I heard Constable Lee shout.</p><p>\"What girl?\" I said.</p><p>\"There was a girl walking alongside the road. Didn't you see her?\" Constable Lee asked me.</p><p>Once the vehicle had stopped, all four of us climbed out. It was then I saw a young girl standing beside the road in the dark. I walked towards her. I now know this female to be called Molly Smith. I would describe Molly as being about eighteen years old, and about five foot and four inches in height. She was of slim build, with long black hair and wearing a thin black dress. I noticed her feet were bare, which struck me as being odd, as the night was cold and it was raining. I recognised this girl to be part of a small family who had recently moved to the town of Cliff View. As I approached Smith, I could see that she was in a distressed state. She was crying and shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" I heard Constable McDonald ask her.</p> <p>The girl made no reply, but just stood beside the road, with her hands covering her face while crying.</p><p>\"What are you doing out here all alone?\" I heard Constable Lee ask Smith.</p><p>\"He hates me,\" I heard Smith reply through her sobs.</p><p>\"Who hates you?\" I asked Smith. I was confused as I couldn't see anyone else nearby and didn't know who she was referring to.</p><p>\"Come with us and we will give you a lift home,\" PC Woodland said.</p><p>\"No. I need to go and tell him I love him,\" Smith said.</p> <p>I then saw Smith turn and run into the wooded area beside the road. At this time I lost sight of her. Constable Lee ran back to the police van and returned a short time later with two large dragon lights. He gave one of them to me and kept the other.</p><p>The four of us then made our way into the thick crop of trees beside the road in search of Smith. Even with the powerful dragon lights, it was dark inside the woods and we became easily disorientated. The ground was wet and slippery and made our progress slow as we made our way up the hill which leads to the Grayson farm. We must have been searching for Smith for at least ten minutes or more, when I heard a scream from the distance.</p><p>Together, me and my colleagues headed in the direction of the scream until we reached the crest of the hill where we found a well. I saw Constable Lee run to the side of the well and aim his dragon light down into it.</p><p>\"The girl has fallen into the well,\" Constable Lee said.</p><p>Myself, Constable Woodland, and Constable MacDonald joined Constable Lee at the side of the well. I pointed my dragon light into it. At the bottom of the well, I could see Smith. She was lying on her back in a pool of water.</p><p>\"Hey!\" I shouted into the well, but Smith didn't move or stir.</p><p>\"I think she might be dead,\" I heard Constable Lee say as he climbed up and onto the edge of the well.</p><p>\"Get down from there,\" Constable MacDonald said to Constable Lee.</p> <p>\"I'm going to go down. She could still be alive. Call for help,\" Constable Lee said.</p><p>It was still raining at this time, and the edge of the well looked wet and slippery. I reached for my radio to call for help, when I heard Constable Lee shout. I looked up to see that he was no longer balanced on the edge of the well. I raced towards the well with Constables MacDonald and Woodland to discover that Constable Lee had fallen down into the well.</p><p>I heard Constable MacDonald shout into the well over and over again. He sounded panicked, as we all were. At this time, I contacted the control room by way of my personal radio and asked for immediate assistance. I felt powerless to help Constable Lee, who was now lying unconscious at the bottom of the well with Smith. Constable Woodland started to scream and kick the side of the well. Even though I had already contacted the control room, I heard Constable McDonald repeatedly shouting into the radio for help.</p><p>About 23:50 hours the same day, we were joined at the well by other members of the emergency services. I was taken to a nearby police vehicle and treated for shock. It was during this time I learnt that both Molly Smith and Constable Lee had died by falling into the well.</p><p>Police Constable Richard Hart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I handed my father's ten year old statement back to Vincent, who sat silently beside me on the sofa. It had felt strange reading my father's words - words that he had written so long ago. Again it felt as if I were spying on him somehow - as if I had found his private diary and sneaked a peek inside. I had never known he had witnessed the death of a friend and colleague, and in a way, it explained why he, Mac, and Woody had such a close bond.</p><p>\"So Jonathan Smith was right in his suspicions that his daughter was involved with a local man,\" I said, looking at Vincent.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he nodded.</p><p>\"Did they ever find out who he was?\" I asked.</p> <p>\"Nope,\" Vincent said, slipping my father's statement back into the file and pulling out another.</p><p>\"How come?\"</p><p>\"Because your father changed his statement,\" Vincent said, looking at me. \"All three of them did.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean my father changed his statement?\" I breathed, eyeing the sheets of paper Vincent was now holding.</p><p>\"I found this,\" he said, passing a new statement to me. \"At first glance it reads almost identically to the other, but there is a difference.\"</p> <p>\"Like what?\" I asked, looking down at what appeared to be an exact copy of the first statement I had read.</p><p>\"Read the paragraph about how your father and the others first came across the girl, Molly Smith,\" Vincent said, his voice barely a whisper.</p><p>With my hands gripping the edges of the paper, and my mouth turning dry, I scanned the statement until I found the part where my father and the other constables had been in the van on the road. To my horror, it had been changed. My father's account now read like this:</p><p>I was sitting in the passenger seat next to Constable Lee and Constables MacDonald and Woodland were both seated in the back. Suddenly Constable Lee swerved the vehicle away from the curb and braked sharply.</p><p>\"I nearly hit that girl,\" I heard Constable Lee shout.</p><p>\"What girl?\" I said.</p> <p>\"There was a girl walking alongside the road. Didn't you see her?\" Constable Lee asked me.</p><p>Once the vehicle had stopped, all four of us climbed out. It was then I saw a young girl standing beside the road in the dark. I walked towards her. I now know this female to be called Molly Smith. I would describe Molly as being about eighteen years old, and about five foot and four inches in height. She was of slim build, with long black hair and wearing a thin black dress. I noticed her feet were bare, which struck me as being odd, as the night was cold and it was raining. I recognised this girl to be part of a small family who had recently moved to the town of Cliff View, who had been suspected of committing burglaries in the area. As I approached Smith, I said, \"What are you doing all the way out here in the dark?\"</p><p>\"Fuck off, copper!\" I heard Smith shout.</p><p>I then saw Smith turn and run into the wooded area beside the road. At this time, I lost sight of her. Constable Lee ran back to the police van and returned a short time later with two large dragon lights. He gave one of them to me and kept the other. The four of us then made our way into the thick crop of trees beside the road in search of Smith...</p><p>The rest of the statement read exactly the same as the first. With my hands trembling, I handed the statement back to Vincent. I didn't want to touch it. I didn't want to be a part of his lies.</p><p>\"Why?\" I gasped, although I knew the answer already.</p><p>\"I guess it was easier to say it happened like that,\" Vincent said. \"The old guy - Jonathan Smith - suspected that his daughter had gone to meet someone that night, a man who she had been having a secret relationship with. We know from your father's first statement that really was what happened. I guess once the old guy started kicking up a fuss, it was easier to change the statement...\"</p><p>\"So as not to point the finger at any of the good townsfolk of Cliff View,\" I whispered. \"After all, the Smith family was seen as just a bunch of thieves, drifters - witches.\"</p> <p>\"And I guess the local police didn't want to go asking all sorts of questions and unearth some secret relationship between one of the Smiths and a law-abiding member of the community,\" Vincent said. \"I guess it could have been any man Molly Smith was meeting that night. They could've been married - they could've been a cop. How would that have looked in the eyes of the local community?\"</p><p>I felt numb all over and sick to the pit of my stomach. Now I could understand how easily my father, Mac, and Woody had got their stories straight - how they had twisted the truth about the accident I had been involved in. They had done it before to protect someone from the local community, like they had lied to protect me. They had made Molly Smith look as if she were out that night committing thefts, just like they had made out that Jonathan Smith was reckless enough to cause that accident out on the road. But I was a part of that lie. I had gone along with it to protect myself. So was I any better than my father, Mac, or Woody? I guessed not. However wrong my father's actions had been, I could understand him risking so much to protect me - I was his daughter. Who could have meant so much to him that he would have lied all those years ago? Who had he been so desperate to protect, and why?</p><p>\"Whatever happened in the past is done now,\" Vincent said. \"We know your father changed his statement and I'm not saying that is right. Whatever way you look at it, Molly Smith's death was an accident. What good would come out of digging up the past just to find out who it was she met up with that night?\"</p><p>Slowly, I lifted my head and looked at Vincent. \"I don't believe her death was an accident,\" I said.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" he asked right back.</p><p>\"Molly Smith was pushed into that well,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"How can you be so sure?\" he frowned at me.</p><p>\"Because she told me,\" I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As soon as the words were out, I wished at once I could take them back again. Vincent looked at me. There was a long, uncomfortable silence and I wished that The Black Eyed Peas were roaring from the speakers again. Maybe the music would have drowned out what I'd just said.</p><p>Finally Vincent said, \"What do you mean she told you? Molly Smith is dead.\"</p><p>I got up and went to the window and folded my arms across my chest. \"I dream about her,\" I said, my back to Vincent. \"They're more nightmares, really.\"</p><p>\"What happens in these nightmares?\" Vincent asked, sounding as if he was genuinely interested.</p> <p>\"I'm down in that well with Molly,\" I said, unable to turn and face him.</p><p>\"How long have you been dreaming about her?\" he asked, and I could hear him getting up from the sofa.</p><p>\"Ever since I wiped out her family on that road,\" I whispered. \"At first I thought I was dreaming about the old man because of a guilty conscience. Then you mentioned the death of a young girl in a well and I thought I'd dreamt of her because of what you had said.\"</p><p>\"Why don't you think that anymore?\" he asked, and I could see his reflection in the windowpane as he stopped just behind me. Part of me wanted to turn to him and be held in his arms. I felt scared all of a sudden. But I couldn't turn around and face him.</p><p>\"I found out where that well was,\" I started. \"So I went there today, and it's the well from my dreams. How could I dream about a well I'd never seen before? Don't you think it's a bit strange that I kill Jonathan Smith and his family, only to end up dreaming about his daughter who died in a well ten years before? What are the odds of that happening?\"</p> <p>\"There could be any number of reasons why,\" Vincent said softly, that joking manner of his now gone.</p><p>\"Like what?\" I whispered, more to myself than him. \"That old guy called me a witch before he died. Perhaps he was cursing me - and now I'm paying for what I did.\"</p><p>\"But you didn't do anything, did you?\" he asked. \"It was his fault you drove into him and his family. Wasn't it?\"</p><p>I very much wanted to tell Vincent what really had happened. I wanted to tell him what had happened between me and Michael up at that farmhouse, how I'd been drinking and how I'd fled at speed when I'd heard the control room trying to raise me on the radio. I wanted to tell Vincent how I'd been busy searching through the glove compartment for gum to rid my breath of the smell of whiskey when I ploughed into the horse and cart. I just wanted to scream. I wanted to confess it was another of my father's cover-ups which I had become involved in. But I couldn't. I didn't even know Vincent that well. It wasn't like I was planning on confessing to a priest. This was another copper who would be duty-bound to do the right thing and make sure justice was seen to be done.</p><p>\"I guess it wasn't really my fault,\" I said, and a part of me felt like it had just died as I continued the lie my father had started out on the road.</p><p>\"Then you have nothing to worry about,\" Vincent said. \"And Jonathan Smith would have no reason to curse you.\"</p> <p>\"Then why call me a witch?\" I said, summoning up the nerve to turn and look him in the eye.</p><p>\"Who knows?\" Vincent said with a shrug. \"The guy was dying. He could've been trying to say anything.\"</p><p>\"He definitely said witch,\" I breathed.</p><p>Vincent looked at me, and I could see biscuit crumbs on his work tie. I reached out to brush them off, when Vincent suddenly took hold of my hand in his. His touch was soft - gentle. Part of me wanted to pull my hand away, but I didn't. He looked at me, and I looked back at him. There was another uncomfortable silence.</p><p>\"So if what you say is true, and Molly did tell you in a dream she was pushed into that well, then you know what we've got ourselves?\" Vincent said.</p><p>\"No,\" I whispered, shaking my head and looking into his deep near-black eyes.</p><p>\"We've got ourselves an X-File, Scully,\" he smiled.</p><p>I snatched my hand from his. \"I knew it was too good to be true,\" I hissed.</p> <p>\"What is?\" he said, looking confused again.</p><p>\"You taking what I had to say seriously,\" I snapped at him. \"I thought you believed me, when all the while you've just been taking the piss!\"</p><p>\"Hey!\" Vincent said back, taking my hand again, but this time more forcibly. \"Who says I was taking the piss? I was being serious about the whole X-File thing. I believe you, Sydney. Honestly, I do.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I said, trying to pull my hand free.</p><p>\"Because what you told me about your dreams took courage,\" he said. \"Most people wouldn't have said anything for fear of being laughed at. But you trusted me enough to tell me, and that means a lot.\"</p><p>\"I could've been making the whole thing up,\" I said, still trying to wriggle my fingers free of his grasp.</p><p>\"I don't think so,\" he said.</p><p>\"Why not?\" I demanded.</p><p>\"Because I've never seen such fear in anyone's eyes before,\" he said, letting go of my hand. \"Something has spooked you real bad, and I want to help you if I can.\"</p><p>\"Why do you want to help me?\" I asked. \"You don't even know me.\"</p><p>\"Does there have to be a reason?\" he said, turning away and heading back towards the sofa.</p><p>\"Yes,\" I said. \"You only met me yesterday, so why would you want to get mixed up in something as mad as this?\"</p><p>\"For the same reason I drive you half crazy,\" he said, wheeling around to face me.</p><p>\"And what's that?\"</p><p>\"Because I can't help poking my nose into stuff that has nothing to do with me,\" he said.</p><p>\"You certainly have a habit of doing that,\" I sighed.</p><p>Looking at me, Vincent said, \"You look kinda disappointed.\"</p><p>\"About what?\" I asked, confused.</p><p>\"The reason for me wanting to help you,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't know what you're talking about.\" Now it was my turn to blush. It didn't happen often.</p><p>\"You were hoping I only wanted to help you out because I liked you,\" he said.</p><p>\"Well?\" I dared to ask.</p><p>\"Well what?\" he shot back.</p><p>\"Do you like me?\"</p><p>Vincent looked at me for what seemed like the longest time, then shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\"You like me,\" I half-smiled at him. \"You've hinted enough.\"</p><p>\"Hinted?\" Vincent said looking surprised.</p><p>\"You know what I'm talking about,\" I said. \"All that stuff about going to bed and playing romantic music. Your problem is you just don't know how to come out and say it.\"</p><p>\"You just keep thinking that,\" he smiled, plucking his coat from the back of the armchair and heading for the door. \"If that's what you want to believe.\" Vincent opened the front door and tucked the file inside his coat.</p><p>\"When will I see you again?\" I asked. \"I thought you said we had a mystery to solve?\"</p><p>\"And we do,\" he said, turning to look at me with a smile. \"I'm just gonna go back to the filing room and see if I can't find some more of those missing pieces. I'll be in touch. Be good.\"</p><p>Just as he was about to disappear behind the closing door, I called out and said, \"Vincent, can you do me a favour?\"</p><p>\"What's that?\" he said, poking his head back around the edge of the door.</p><p>\"See what you can dig up on a guy named Michael Grayson and his father,\" I said.</p><p>\"The farmer and his son, right?\" Vincent said. \"Any particular reason?\"</p><p>\"The well is on their land, that's all,\" I lied.</p><p>\"Okay,\" Vincent said, closing the door behind him and leaving me alone in my apartment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Could Michael have been in some way involved in Molly Smith's death? I didn't know, and that's why I'd asked Vincent to do some research on both Michael and his father. I just couldn't forget how Michael's face had paled when I had mentioned the death of Molly to him. There was something else, like an itch that just wouldn't go away. Michael knew I had killed that old guy and his family out on the road, so why hadn't he told me about the other member of that family falling into the well on his land? He would have made the connection, right? I mean, no one forgets a thing like that.</p><p>But was I putting two and two together and making five, like Michael said I was? Perhaps he just hadn't wanted to bring up the whole incident again about Molly Smith falling into the well. It had been a long time ago. Michael had been in the Army, his life had moved on. Perhaps he hadn't wanted to be reminded of his past life for personal reasons known only to him. Besides, I didn't even really know Michael. We had slept together - had a passionate fling - but did that really mean he had to share his life's secrets with me? Had I shared mine with him? We all had stuff lurking in the darkness which we would all rather forget.</p><p>I took the two empty teacups and Vincent's half-eaten sandwich into the kitchen. Maybe I had been wrong to ask him to snoop on Michael and his father. Shouldn't I be focusing my attention on who Molly had gone to meet that night? Who had she been in a relationship with? Michael? But wouldn't he have come forward if his girlfriend had fallen into the well? But then again, probably not. I remembered how his father had referred to the Smith family as vermin. If Michael's father disliked them so much, would he have confessed his love for one of them? But the girl had died, and to keep such a secret after that - to let the girl he had loved be remembered as a trespasser on his land - a criminal and thief, what sort of person could do that? Michael didn't seem a nasty person. He appeared better than that.</p><p>I switched out the kitchen light and flopped onto the sofa. Picking up the remote, I turned on the T.V., anything to try and clear my mind of the nagging thoughts which swirled there. It was no good - my mind wouldn't clear. When I thought I was some way to figuring it all out, another thought would enter my mind and throw everything into confusion again. It couldn't have been Michael that Molly was going to meet that night. Whoever she had gone to see was important enough for my father, Mac, Woody, and perhaps even Skrimshire to lie for. They had all changed their statements to protect someone - but who?</p> <p>My father had got his friends to lie for me over the accident because I was his daughter. But who could have meant so much to my father that he would have risked everything for them? But not only would they have had to have meant a great deal to my father, but Mac and Woody, too. They wouldn't have risked everything for Michael or his father. So who had it been?</p><p>I switched off the T.V. and turned to my iPad. Picking it up, I hit the iBook icon and tried to engross myself in the book, Blood, Bullets and Blue Stratos, which I was about halfway through. I just couldn't concentrate on it. Why didn't I just ask my father who he had risked everything for? Because I would drop Vincent in it. So? I hardly knew him. He was a nice guy and I'd asked him to bring that file to me. I'd promised him I would keep it a secret. Vincent was new at the station and it wouldn't have been fair to put him at odds with my father, Mac, and Woody so early on in his new career. I knew what the three of them could be like together. And would my father tell me? No. I knew in my heart he wouldn't. He wasn't going to reveal a secret like that to his hare-brained daughter who he thought would more than likely tell the world the next time she was pissed out of her skull.</p><p>I couldn't betray Vincent's trust. I would have to find out who Molly had met that night, but more importantly, who had pushed her into the well. For once in my life, I knew I wouldn't be able to rely on my father for help. For once, I would have to depend on myself.</p><p>Turning off my iPad, I climbed off the sofa and went to bed, secretly praying that my dreams wouldn't be haunted by Jonathan Smith again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hadn't been in bed long, just enough time to find that comfortable place between semi-consciousness and sleep. There was a knocking sound, and, believing at first it was just my imagination, I turned over onto my side. The knocking came again, this time louder. I opened my eyes. The bedside clock read 00:03 hrs. Who could be knocking at this time of night? With my head cocked to one side above the covers, I listened.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Sighing, I dropped my head onto the pillow again and closed my eyes. The knocking came again.</p><p>Louder.</p> <p>I sat up.</p><p>It came again. This time more persistently.</p><p>Reaching down, I snatched my bathrobe from the floor and slipped it on, fastening it tightly about my waist. I went to the living room and the knocking came again. It was clearer now. Somebody was knocking on my front door. Slowly, I crossed the room and went into the hall.</p><p>Knock! Knock! Knock!</p><p>\"Hello?\" I called out, my hand hovering over the lock. \"Who is it?\"</p> <p>\"It's me, Vincent,\" he said.</p><p>With the side of my face just an inch from the door, I whispered, \"Vincent, do you have any idea what time it is?\"</p><p>\"I know it's late,\" he whispered back. \"But I need to speak to you.\"</p><p>\"Can't it wait until the morning?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Not really,\" he said from the other side of the door.</p><p>After quickly combing my hair with my fingers, I knocked my fringe from my brow and opened the front door. Vincent stood on the other side. He didn't look as if he'd been home since leaving mine earlier that evening. Beneath his open jacket, I could see he was still wearing his white police shirt, black work trousers, and boots. Vincent looked pale and nervous.</p> <p>\"Are you okay?\" I asked, stepping aside.</p><p>Vincent came into my apartment and I closed the door behind him.</p><p>He appeared anxious as he looked about the living room.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" I asked him again.</p><p>Vincent looked at me and nodded.</p><p>\"You look kinda on edge,\" I said.</p><p>\"Perhaps I should go,\" he whispered, brushing past me, heading towards the door again.</p><p>\"Hang on,\" I groaned, taking his arm. \"You can't just come around here in the middle of the night and wake me up only to disappear again. Tell me whatever it is you've come to say.\"</p> <p>Vincent went to speak, then stopped. He took a bottle of Coke from his jacket pocket, unscrewed the lid, and drank. I watched his Adam's apple bob up and down as he finished off the sticky black contents. He replaced the lid, put the empty bottle onto the coffee table, and took a deep breath.</p><p>\"This isn't easy for me,\" he started nervously.</p><p>\"It's okay,\" I said, looking at him with a frown etched across my brow.</p><p>\"It's just that...oh, God where do I start...\" he stammered as he fought to find the right words. \"Okay...I'll be totally honest with you...I've been lying to you...\"</p><p>\"What?\" I said, confused. \"What does that mean? What, you've been lying about my father and what happened to Molly Smi - \"</p><p>\"No,\" Vincent cut in. \"I haven't been lying about that.\"</p><p>\"What then?\" I snapped, starting to feel cheated in some way.</p><p>\"Oh, God...\" Vincent sighed, nervously wringing his hands together. \"How do I say this...it's funny because I've been walking around and around the town since leaving here...going over and over in my mind how I was going to tell you the truth...and now I've completely forgotten...\"</p><p>\"Just spit it out,\" I snapped, placing my hands on my hips.</p><p>\"Okay...mmm...let me think...\" Vincent mumbled. Glancing around the living room, he added, \"Where's your iPod?\"</p><p>\"Over there,\" I hissed, pointing at the dock on the other side of the room.</p><p>\"Just wait right here,\" Vincent said, heading across the room.</p><p>I stood and glared at his back as Vincent fumbled about, trying to switch on the iPod.</p><p>\"Oh, Christ, you're not gonna start dancing again, are you?\"</p><p>Vincent didn't answer. Instead, the song I won't let you go by James Morrison started to play.</p><p>\"Vincent...\" I started, beginning to get annoyed by his games.</p><p>With the music playing softly in the background, Vincent came back across the room. He gently took hold of me by placing his trembling hands on my hips.</p><p>\"Vincent, what the fu...\" I started.</p><p>\"Shhh,\" he hushed, \"or I'll never say what it is I need to tell you.\"</p><p>\"The truth, you mean?\" I said sarcastically.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he nodded and closed his eyes. Swallowing hard, he said, \"Here goes nothing.\" Opening his dark black eyes, he looked at me as he gently swayed me from side to side in time with the music. \"Mac never asked me to bring your iPod over here. I lied about that.\"</p><p>\"Is that it?\" I asked, not knowing whether I should feel relieved or not.</p><p>\"I heard your father ask Mac to bring it over to you,\" he said, taking another deep breath. \"I could tell Mac was busy, so I offered to bring it here.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" I asked over the music.</p><p>\"I saw that picture of you in the newspaper,\" Vincent said, as if preparing to confess some great sin.</p><p>\"The picture where I look fat, you mean?\" I shot back.</p><p>\"Yes...no!\" he said. \"I didn't mean it to sound like that the other night. I saw that picture of you and thought you looked...\" he trailed off.</p><p>\"You thought what?\" I pushed.</p><p>\"I thought...I thought...oh, God,\" he sighed, closing his eyes. \"I thought you looked beautiful... and I wanted to meet you to see if you could really look as beautiful in real life as you looked in the picture...and on the way over here...I checked out your iPod because I didn't know what to say...so I thought if I knew what sort of music you liked...then we would have something to talk about...because I'm not very good at talking to girls...I always end up making myself look stupid and I was looking for something romantic that I could play...and I saw the song Every Breath You Take so I downloaded it...then I thought that perhaps that song with the words 'every breath you take I'll be watching you' would sound kinda creepy...and you would think I was a pervert...and...\" Vincent finally ran out of breath.</p><p>I felt stunned by his sudden confession. \"Slow down,\" I said, looking at him as he continued to sway me gently to the music.</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" he breathed deeply. \"I shouldn't have said anything...I've gone and made a fool of myself...and embarrassed you...\"</p><p>\"You haven't made a fool of yourself,\" I said. \"And you haven't embarrassed me. I'm a little shocked, but...\"</p><p>\"You want me to go...I can understand that...\" he said, taking his hands from my hips. \"I should've never come back...It was a mistake...I shouldn't have said anything...You must think I'm a right...\"</p><p>\"Shhh,\" I said, placing a finger against his lips. \"I'm kinda used to men coming on strong...but nothing like this.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" he said again.</p><p>\"You don't have to be sorry,\" I smiled. \"You have no idea how nice it is to have someone do what you've just done.\"</p><p>\"What have I just done?\" he said, a confused look on his face.</p><p>\"The most romantic thing any guy has ever done for me,\" I said, as James Morrison continued to sing in the background. \"Most guys just grab my arse, stare at my tits, and do whatever they can to get me into bed on the very first date. No guy has ever wanted to dance with me...not like this.\"</p><p>Vincent placed his hands on my hips again and pulled me close. With our bodies pressed gently together, we stood in my living room and danced.</p><p>\"If there's love just feel it...and if there's life we'll see it...\" Vincent sung softly against my cheek. \"This is no time to be alone...I won't let you go...\" he continued to sing just above a whisper to the music.</p><p>Was this for real? I wondered. Vincent was a little odd - unconventional in his own way. But did this man really just want to dance with me? Just hold me in his arms? Had a man come into my life who wanted more from me than just sex? To be with him like this made me wonder if I had finally met someone who liked me enough to fumble their words, make a fool of themselves, come back in the middle of the night not to fuck me, but hold me - dance with me - tell me how much they really liked me. To be with Vincent like this made me realise what it was I'd really been searching for. Deep in my heart, I knew I was tired of those shallow relationships which never went further than the bedroom. With tears beginning to stand in my eyes, I wanted to tell Vincent how wonderful it had been to hear him say I was beautiful - and not just a good fuck.</p><p>\"If your sky is falling...just take my hand and hold it...\" Vincent continued to sing softly in time with the music, as we swayed against each other, cheek to cheek. \"You don't have to be alone...I won't let you go...\"</p><p>With tears spilling silently onto my face, I felt something I hadn't felt before. I felt I was in the presence of someone who really, genuinely liked me, and it is so hard for me to describe how that felt. Vincent hadn't come back to rip my clothes off me. He hadn't come to me in the middle of the night to throw me over the edge of the sofa and screw me. Vincent had come to hold me close, to make me feel warm, to make me feel special. For the first time ever with a man, I didn't feel like I had to be some kind of sex object...some sex-performing seal ....for him to like me - to want to be with me. For the first time ever with a man, there was a part of me which didn't feel alone.</p><p>The music stopped, and Vincent eased us apart. He saw the tears on my cheeks. Gently cupping my face in his hands, he brushed the tears away with his thumbs. Very slowly he leant forward and kissed me on the lips. The kiss lasted just moments. I opened my eyes as Vincent led me by the hand to my bedroom. Slowly, we climbed onto the bed and lay down next to one another, our faces just inches apart.</p><p>\"I know what it feels like to be scared and alone,\" he whispered, folding his arms around me and holding me close. \"You can sleep without fear of nightmares tonight, Sydney. You don't have to be alone. I won't let you go.\"</p><p>Slowly, I closed my eyes, and wrapped in Vincent's arms, I let sleep take me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I woke to find myself alone. There was no sign of Vincent. A thin strip of sunlight seeped through a gap in the curtains. I rolled over on the bed and glanced at the clock. It read 12:17. Had I really slept half of the day away? I felt better for it, my head clearer somehow. My sleep had been unbroken and Molly Smith and her father had stayed away. Swinging my legs over the side of the bed, I stood up.</p><p>\"Vincent?\" I called out.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Standing alone in my bedroom, I wondered if Vincent returning hadn't been a dream. Had he really come back last night to tell me he thought I was beautiful? Had we really danced together in each other's arms? Had Vincent kissed me then held me in his arms all night long and had wanted nothing more from me? It couldn't have been real. Stuff like that didn't happen - not in Sydney's world.</p> <p>I padded out of my bedroom and into the living room. There was no sign of Vincent and the room looked just like it had before I'd gone to bed last night. Then, I saw it and my heart fluttered. I crossed the room to the coffee table and picked up the empty Coke bottle Vincent had left behind. He had come back last night. He had told me how he had offered to bring me my iPod just because he thought I'd looked beautiful in the newspaper. We had danced together. He had kissed me, then held me close all night. Vincent had kept the nightmares away like he'd promised he would.</p><p>I went to place the bottle back down on the table, when I saw the folded piece of paper tucked inside. At once, my skin prickled all over with gooseflesh as I remembered the bottle in the bottom of the well from my nightmare. Slowly, I unscrewed the lid and tipped the bottle up in the palm of my hand. I hooked my little finger in and eased out the folded piece of paper. Once out, I unfolded it. A message had been written across it.</p><p>Hey Sydney,</p><p>Gone into work to find more of those missing pieces from our mystery.</p><p>I'll catch you later</p> <p>Vincent X</p><p>I refolded the note and placed it back inside the bottle. Why had Vincent left me a note in the bottle and not on the table? Perhaps he didn't want anyone else to come across it and take a look. But who? I lived alone. Then again, perhaps Vincent suspected that my father might come over - perhaps he even had a key and could let himself in. We were meant to be keeping our friendship secret from my father.</p><p>Why had I started to think so deeply about everything - stuff that probably didn't even matter? I headed for the bathroom. I was sure the bottle did matter. Not the one Vincent had left on the coffee table - who knows why Vincent did that - I bet he didn't even know himself. That was just Vincent, I had come to learn. The bottle at the bottom of the well was different, though, I reasoned as I filled the bath with hot water. I had seen it in my dream, just like I had seen Molly and her father. Therefore wasn't the bottle somehow important, too?</p><p>I turned off the taps, let my bathrobe fall to the floor, then stepped into the bath. Sinking beneath the water, I closed my eyes. If the note did have some bearing on what had happened to Molly, what would it say and who could possibly have written it - and why? The only way to find out would be to retrieve the bottle. But how?</p><p>Massaging shampoo into my hair with my fingertips, I pictured the well and how it seemed to plummet deep into the earth. I imagined standing on the crest of that hill again and looking out towards the road and the farmhouse. Was there anything I was missing? After the deep night's sleep I'd had, thanks to Vincent, my mind seemed less foggy. It was sharper than it had been since the accident. In my mind I saw the road, the blood, the dead bodies, broken windscreen, tyre marks, the crinkled-looking ECILOP...</p><p>\"Tyre marks!\" I breathed, sitting bolt upright in the water. \"How come there were brake marks on the road by the accident? I never hit the brakes. I didn't see the horse and the cart, so why would I have slammed on the brakes?\"</p> <p>I washed the remains of the shampoo from my hair and jumped from the bath. Throwing a towel about me, I raced to my bedroom, all the while the images of those thick, black tyre marks flashing before my mind.</p><p>\"I didn't make those tyre marks,\" I whispered aloud, pulling a T-shirt over my head. I plucked a clean pair of panties from a drawer. With them halfway up my legs, I stopped. Almost like a blinding vision before me, all I could see were those dents and scratch marks at the front and down the side of Michael's father's 4X4.</p><p>My father had a knock the other day, I heard Michael say.</p><p>Had it been on the same day Jonathan Smith and his family been hit by a vehicle on the road which ran around the outskirts of Grayson Farm? I wondered.</p><p>With my hands shaking, I yanked on my jeans, and gasped, \"What if...?\"</p><p>What if the accident had already taken place? What if someone else had driven them off the road before I'd even got there? What if I'd just driven into the wreckage? But the other vehicle would've been a wreck, too, just like my patrol car had been after hitting that horse and cart.</p><p>\"Not unless it had been a big car,\" I whispered in shock. \"Something like a four-by-four!\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sky was the colour of gunmetal when I left my apartment and headed off along the beach to the Grayson farm. With the realisation that I might not have actually been the person to drive the Smith family off the road to their deaths, I wanted to go back and have a look at where it had taken place. The wind whipped up a torrent of sand as I made my way along the shore towards the sand dunes. The waves crashed onto the beach, bringing with them lengths of black seaweed, which covered the sand like giant black cobwebs.</p><p>Reaching the sand dunes, I crossed them, found the coastal path, and headed for the crop of trees in the distance. It was just past 3 p.m. as I reached the old well. Hidden by the trees at the top of the hill, I spied on the Grayson farm. The 4X4 was no longer parked outside - did that mean that both Michael and his father were out? Or perhaps off somewhere working on their land? Then I saw Michael. He left the barn, rubbing tractor grease from his hands. I watched him approach the farmhouse, then go inside and shut the door. As I watched from my hiding place, I hoped that Michael wasn't involved in what had happened to that family. He couldn't have been. He had been with me. We had been on the kitchen table...I pushed the image from my mind. Not that I regretted what had happened between us, I wanted to try and keep my feelings neutral at this time. He might not have been involved in the accident, but he might be covering for his father. I hoped not, as Michael - although full on - did seem like a kind and honest man. I didn't want him to be a bad guy. I didn't want to find out that I had been deceived by him and he had joked with his father at how easy I had been. I turned my back on the farm.</p><p>The Buckmore Road couldn't be seen from the house, only from this vantage point as it snaked its way back towards town. Stepping out from the trees, I made my way down the hill and towards the road.</p><p>Storm clouds lumbered across the sky, covering the pale sun, making the world look like an old black and white photograph. The wind was icy cold and it howled at me like an invisible beast as I cut across the bleak field towards the road. With my hands thrust into my coat pockets and chin resting on my chest, I stomped over the uneven and muddy ground. At the edge of the field, I looked back just to make sure I couldn't be seen by Michael, should he have reason to look out of one of the farmhouse windows. From where I stood against the wall, the farmhouse was hidden from view on the other side of the grey craggy hill. With long, blond hair blowing about my face and shoulders, I felt secure in the fact that I couldn't be seen from the farmhouse. All I had to worry about was if Michael's father returned by road.</p> <p>With my gloved hands, I pushed aside the thorn bushes and bracken which greedily covered the grey stone wall along this side of the field. Looking left, then right, I hoisted myself up onto the wall. The thorns snagged at my coat and the hems of my jeans. I yanked myself free, and dropped into the road on the other side.</p><p>I looked to my right, and with my back to the hill, I headed off along the road. I didn't have to go very far before I came across the scene of the accident. It was hard at first to get my bearings, as the last time I'd been here, I'd been shaken and in shock. I saw the spot in the ditch where my patrol car had ended up on its side. The bushes and bracken there were bent over and disrupted. Slowly, I moved further along the road to where the cart and the horse and been lying. I looked down and could see rusty brown bloodstains, which hadn't yet been washed away by the rain. I closed my eyes, and at once I could see the small boy with his bright red hair matted together in scruffy clumps. I snapped open my eyes and could see the tyre marks. They skewered across the road from the right and towards the area where the cart and the Smith family had come to rest.</p><p>I bent down and inspected them. The tyre marks where thick and black, indicating that whoever had been out on this road had braked hard in their vehicle. That certainly hadn't been me. I was sure of that. Only if I'd seen Jonathan Smith and his family would I have hit the brakes. I closed my eyes again. I could see myself taking my eyes off the road as I reached for the glove compartment. Then my vehicle was lifting off the road and flipping through the air. My patrol car stopped, not because I had hit the brakes, but because I hit the ditch and the wall beyond it. In my mind I could see myself staring through the cracked window screen of my patrol car. It gave the world a distorted and broken look. I could see my father arriving in his police car, lights and sirens blazing, the ECILOP sign looking distorted and out of shape. My father was beside me, pulling me from the car and dragging me angrily towards the accident.</p><p>Look what you've done! I could hear him barking at me over the roar of the wind.</p><p>I'm so sorry, I cried out.</p> <p>I could see the blood again, black and congealed in the road, that little boy's hair thick with it...</p><p>\"The blood,\" I whispered. \"The blood!\"</p><p>However painful it was, I closed my eyes and pictured that horrendous scene in my mind again. I could see the blood beneath the wheels of the upturned cart. I could see the blood down the front of the man trapped by the wheel, the woman with it on her face, the boy with it in his hair, and that flap of flesh hanging loosely from Jonathan Smith's face. All of the blood was black, sticky and congealed.</p><p>\"None of the blood was fresh,\" I breathed, snapping open my eyes.</p><p>Now, I knew blood congealed fairly quickly and it had been cold that day - but there was no way the blood would have thickened within a few minutes. Those people had been lying out on this desolate stretch of road for at least...what? Ten minutes, maybe or more. With my heart racing in my chest, I knew it couldn't have been me who had killed those people. Someone else had killed them, then fled the scene.</p><p>With my heart racing in my chest, I felt angry and hurt that I'd been punishing myself for something I hadn't done. I wanted to scream and tell the world that I hadn't killed Smith and the rest of his family. It felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from my chest and I could at last breathe again. I felt a sudden flash of seething anger towards my father. If he hadn't of been so quick to blame me, yet again, then cover for me, he could have done a proper investigation for once in his life and found the true culprit. Was it too late for that now? I wanted to march straight into town and tell him and the others I was innocent. I wanted to scream at those townsfolk who had stared at me, rolled their eyes, thinking that I had fucked up again. Could the clock ever be turned back? Would my father's lies be revealed? Would he be ruined? Could I do that to him?</p> <p>As I stood in the middle of the road fearing that I might never be able to prove my innocence, I suddenly felt a hand fall onto my shoulder.</p><p>\"What are you doing all the way out here?\" a voice said.</p><p>With a high-pitched gasp, I spun around. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I could ask you the same question,\" I said, staring at Vincent.</p><p>\"I've been searching for you,\" he said, dismounting from an old-looking push bike.</p><p>\"No patrol car?\" I asked with a half-smile.</p><p>\"They are a bit short of them back at the station,\" he said. \"The one you were driving is still out of action and another has also gone in for some repairs.\"</p> <p>Vincent pulled the collar of his police coat up about his throat and shivered. \"I'm frozen,\" he groaned.</p><p>\"Quit complaining,\" I said. For the first time in Vincent's presence, I wasn't sure how to act. I hadn't seen him since last night, when he had kissed me, then held me all night in his arms. Did he feel awkward, too? I wondered.</p><p>There was an uncomfortable silence, filled only by the howl of the wind as its cut across the open fields and circled us. \"Did you sleep okay?\" Vincent finally asked.</p><p>\"Great, thanks to you,\" I said, looking at him.</p><p>\"It was nothing...\"</p> <p>\"Thanks,\" I said.</p><p>\"No...I didn't mean it meant nothing,\" he started to flounder to find the right words again. \"It was nice...it was more than nice...it was wonderful...\"</p><p>He did look kinda cute as he shifted from foot to foot in front of me, looking awkward and uncomfortable.</p><p>\"I'm just teasing,\" I said, taking one of his hands in mine. \"You are cold,\" I added. His fingers felt like brittle sticks of ice.</p><p>\"Maybe you could warm me up later,\" he said, then quickly added, \"Want I meant to say was, perhaps you could buy me a cup of tea...\"</p><p>\"When are you gonna quit with this act?\" I asked. \"You and I both know exactly what you meant. Why don't you just say what you mean?\"</p> <p>\"Didn't I do that last night?\" he said, staring back at me, the collar of his police coat flapping against the wind.</p><p>\"Yes, you did,\" I smiled. \"And was it so bad?\"</p><p>\"I guess not,\" he said.</p><p>\"You're not like any guy I've met before,\" I said, trying to figure him out.</p><p>\"Is that a good thing?\" he asked, his eyes still fixed on mine as if reading my thoughts.</p><p>\"I'll let you know,\" I smiled.</p><p>\"How?\"</p><p>\"If I let you hold me in your arms again tonight, that's how you'll know,\" I said softly, dragging away my hair which the wind had blown across my face.</p> <p>\"Did it work?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Stop the nightmares, you mean?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he nodded.</p><p>\"You kept them away,\" I told him, squeezing his hand in mine. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>There was another short silence, which Vincent filled by saying, \"So what are you doing all the way out here?\"</p><p>\"My head felt clear this morning,\" I started to explain. I told Vincent how I was beginning to remember what really had taken place during the accident. \"I don't think it was me who drove the Smiths off the road and killed them.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" he frowned.</p><p>\"Take a look at these,\" I said, kneeling down in the road and pointing out the tyre tracks.</p><p>\"What about them?\" he said, propping his push bike against the wall and leaning over me.</p><p>\"These were caused by someone braking hard, right?\" I said, staring up at him.</p><p>\"Right,\" he nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>\"I never applied the brake of my patrol car. I wasn't even watching the road, I was searching through the glove compartment,\" I confessed to him. \"I didn't even see the horse and cart and Jon...\"</p><p>\"So what you're saying is that you collided with an accident which had already taken place,\" Vincent breathed, straightening up.</p><p>\"You've got it!\" I said, jumping to my feet. \"There was another car out on this road that day. It was that car which collided with the...\"</p><p>\"But those tyre marks could have been made at any time...\" Vincent put in.</p><p>\"They're still fresh,\" I came back at him. \"And what are the odds of someone braking hard exactly in the same place where four people lost their lives?\"</p><p>\"Perhaps whoever left those tyre marks broke hard because of a cow in the road or something,\" Vincent tried to reason with me.</p><p>\"A cow!\" I cried in disbelief. \"What cow? There are no cows around here. Take a look. There are no cows in any of the nearby fields.\"</p><p>\"Some other kind of animal, then?\" Vincent suggested.</p><p>\"There wasn't an animal out on this road,\" I said, staring at him. \"It was a horse and it was pulling a cart which was carrying Jonathan Smith and his family. And it wasn't me who hit them!\"</p><p>\"Who then?\" Vincent asked.</p><p>Turning in the road, I looked back in the direction of the farmhouse. \"Farmer Grayson hit them, not me,\" I breathed.</p><p>\"That reminds me,\" Vincent suddenly said.</p><p>I looked back at him. He was pulling something out of his coat pocket.</p><p>\"What's that?\" I asked, eyeing the folded sheet of paper he was now holding.</p><p>\"You asked me to do some digging on Michael Grayson,\" Vincent said, unfolding the piece of paper. Handing it to me, Vincent added, \"That's a copy of Michael Grayson's criminal record.\"</p><p>\"Criminal record?\" I whispered, staring down at the sheet of paper. It fluttered in the wind and I gripped it in my hands.</p><p>\"Michael Grayson has recently been released from prison, where he served ten years of a fifteen-year sentence for Grievous Bodily Harm,\" Vincent explained.</p><p>\"GBH?\" I breathed, trying to make sense of what I was hearing. \"He couldn't have been in prison. There must be some kind of mistake. Michael has been away in the Army for the last ten years.\"</p><p>\"Not according to that,\" Vincent said, pointing at the sheet of paper I held in my now trembling hands. \"He got convicted of throwing a guy down a flight of stairs in a night club. Really nasty incident, apparently. The guy broke his back. Lucky to still be alive. That's why Michael got such a lengthy sentence.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't make sense,\" I whispered, shaking my head. In my heart I knew it made perfect sense. Michael had lied to me.</p><p>\"Michael Grayson was originally charged with attempted murder, the attack was that bad,\" Vincent continued to explain. \"But he eventually cut a deal with the CPS and he pled guilty to the lesser charge of GBH.\"</p><p>\"But he told me he'd been in the Army,\" I said, looking up from the sheet of paper and at Vincent.</p><p>\"You know him well then?\" Vincent asked.</p><p>\"No, not really,\" I said, pushing away images of Michael and me having sex. I suddenly felt sick in the pit of my stomach. How had I been so fucking stupid? How had I been so desperate? I felt cold all over at the thought that I'd been deceived by him. I'd had sex with a man who had been capable of nearly killing someone. I was meant to be a police officer, for Christ's sake. I thought of my father, and my heart ached because I knew everything he had ever said about me was true. I was reckless and stupid. I was a screw-up, and not only had I let him down again, I'd let myself down like never before. Why had I always been so willing to give myself away? But I knew it had always been love I'd been looking for. The love I had never truly felt from my father nor my mother. He had always been so wrapped up in his career and my mother lost to her secret affairs. Where had I ever fit in to any of that? But I'd always had a choice. I could hate my parents for the mistakes they had made - but not for mine. I had to take responsibility for those.</p><p>Shoving the sheet of paper back into Vincent's hands, I turned and headed back down the road toward the farmhouse.</p><p>\"Hey, Sydney!\" Vincent called after me. \"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"I'll see you later,\" I shouted over my shoulder at him. \"I've got to go and put right a mistake that I've made.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With the wind blowing through my long hair, I marched up the path toward the farmhouse and thumped on the kitchen door. I heard movement from inside. My heart raced and my blood boiled. I couldn't remember ever feeling so angry. The door swung open, Michael suddenly appearing on the other side of it. On seeing me standing there, his eyes lit up.</p><p>\"Hey, Sydney!\" he beamed, his green eyes glowing. \"Come in out of the cold. You look frozen through.\"</p><p>I pushed past him and into the kitchen. As usual, it was full of clutter. The kitchen table was covered in unwashed cups, plates, and littered with old newspapers. How had I ever even considered letting Michael try and have sex with me on there? I wondered angrily inside.</p><p>\"Let me take your coat,\" Michael said, reaching for it.</p> <p>\"I won't be staying,\" I snapped, slapping his hand away.</p><p>\"Is everything okay?\" he asked, eyeing me.</p><p>\"No, everything is not bloody okay,\" I hissed. \"You lied to me!\"</p><p>\"I lied to you?\" Michael said, sounding surprised, but he couldn't mask the sudden look of concern on his face.</p><p>\"You were never in the Army,\" I said, fixing him with a fierce stare.</p> <p>\"I wondered how long it would take for you to find that out,\" he sighed, dropping onto a chair at the table. \"I never wanted to lie to...\"</p><p>\"Spare me the bullshit, Michael,\" I snapped at him. \"You lied to me because you nearly killed a man.\"</p><p>\"I didn't...\"</p><p>\"Stop!\" I said, raising my hand in the air. \"I know exactly what you did. I've read your record. You were lucky not to have gone to prison for attempted murder. Why didn't you tell me?\"</p><p>\"Because I knew you would react like this,\" he shot back. \"You're a cop.\"</p><p>\"So why did you ever come on to me?\" I came back at him.</p> <p>\"Because you looked cute, that's why,\" he said. \"I knew there was an immediate attraction between us - you felt it, too. I thought we might screw around once or twice and that would be the end of it. I'm hardly going to tell you I'm an ex-con while giving you one, am I? I was planning on telling you...\"</p><p>\"When?\" I sneered.</p><p>\"That's why I asked if you wanted to get away from Cliff View for a day,\" he reminded me. \"I was going to tell you then, when we were on our own and we could really talk. I had no idea...\" he trailed off.</p><p>\"What?\" I barked.</p><p>\"I had no idea that I wouldn't be able to get you out my head,\" he said, staring at me. \"Like I've already said, I honestly thought we would fuck once or twice - have some fun - and that would be it. So why would I tell you about my past? Have you told me all about yours?\"</p><p>\"I haven't tried to kill someone,\" I shot back at him.</p><p>\"The guy was a jerk,\" Michael said, standing up. Don't stand there and judge me. You don't know what happened, you weren't there.\"</p><p>\"No one deserves to be thrown down a set of stairs and have their back broken.\"</p> <p>\"Maybe not,\" Michael said, \"But the young girl he wouldn't leave alone didn't deserve to have that filthy animal stick his hand up her skirt all night long. I'd been sitting there drinking and watching him as he kept coming on to this young girl. She kept telling him to piss off, but he wouldn't, and his mates were jeering him on. He started to get nasty with her. I couldn't just sit back and do nothing. I left my seat and asked him nicely to leave the young woman alone. We got into a fight and I lost my temper. Yes, I did push him off me, but I didn't know the staircase was there. He fell, and you know the rest.\"</p><p>\"So why didn't this damsel in distress give evidence for you?\" I cut in.</p><p>\"She didn't want to get involved,\" he sighed. \"That's all the thanks I got for helping her out. I should've just sat there, sipped my beer, and watched just like everybody else. I spent ten years in prison.\"</p><p>\"And the other guy gets to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair,\" I snapped. I didn't want to see Michael's side of the story. I didn't want to feel sorry for him.</p><p>\"Don't you think I haven't thought about that every waking hour for the last ten years?\" he growled. \"I've paid my dues and I can't take back what I did. We all make mistakes. I thought you would understand that more than most.\"</p><p>\"And what is that s'posed to mean?\" I spat.</p><p>\"You shouldn't have been spread across this here kitchen table the other day, should you?\" he said. \"You shouldn't have been drinking whiskey. You're a law-abiding citizen - you're a cop. A cop who dropped her knickers while on duty to have a quick fumble with a convict.\"</p><p>\"You bastard,\" I hissed, slapping Michael hard across the face. His head rocked backwards. The sound of my hand connecting with his face sounded like gunfire in the poky kitchen.</p><p>Michael shot forward, grabbing my by the shoulders. The left side of his face looked red and sore. His eyes had clouded over, and the green had been replaced with a dull grey. I looked into them and could see his anger and pain. Is this how he had looked just before he had pushed that man down the stairs? Is this how he had looked when he pushed...</p><p>\"Oh, my God,\" I breathed. \"It was you...wasn't it?\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" he barked.</p><p>\"It was you who pushed Molly Smith into the well,\" I whispered, shrugging his hands from my shoulders and stepping away from him. \"You pushed her into that well just like you pushed that man down the stairs. It was you she was coming to meet that night...\"</p><p>\"You don't know what you're talking about,\" he said, taking a deep breath as if to calm himself. \"I didn't even know that girl.\"</p><p>\"Yes, you did,\" I said, \"You knew her name. You knew her father. You told me he spoke kinda strange. Pronounced his words kinda funny.\"</p><p>\"I said I knew of them,\" Michael said. \"I didn't say I knew them.\"</p><p>\"That's why you and Molly kept your relationship a secret, because of your father,\" I gasped.</p><p>\"What has he got to do with any of this?\" Michael asked.</p><p>\"Your father hated that family,\" I reminded him. \"He called them witches. He told me that they were nothing but vermin - that they were thieves who kept breaking into his farm. Your father wouldn't have been able to deal with the fact that his son had gone and fallen in love with one of them.\"</p><p>\"Okay, so he didn't like that family, but...\" Michael started.</p><p>\"It wasn't the Smiths who were the criminals. It was you and your father,\" I whispered as everything seemed to slot into place.</p><p>\"My father's not a criminal,\" Michael snapped at me.</p><p>\"Yes, he is,\" I said. \"It wasn't me who killed the Smiths out on the road, it was your father.\"</p><p>Michael looked at me, his face ashen. He opened his mouth as if to speak, then closed it again.</p><p>\"What's going on here?\" someone suddenly thundered from behind me.</p><p>Startled by the deep, booming voice, I looked around to discoverer Michael's father standing in the open kitchen doorway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Sydney was just leaving,\" Michael said, taking me by the arm and guiding me towards the door.</p><p>\"I'm going nowhere,\" I said, shrugging off his arm.</p><p>\"Oh, no?\" Grayson said, eyeing me. \"So what seems to be the problem, officer? You are here in an official capacity, aren't you...or is this some kind of social visit?\" His large bald head looked ruddy and weather-beaten as he closed the door on the cold air blowing into the kitchen.</p><p>Before I'd the chance to answer, Michael cut in and said, \"Sydney seems to think I was somehow connected to the death of that girl who fell into the well.\"</p> <p>\"Her name was Molly Smith,\" I reminded him, shooting Michael a glance. \"She did have a name.\"</p><p>\"What in the hell are you dragging that up for?\" Grayson huffed. \"That was years ago.\"</p><p>\"Sydney seems to think I was having some secret relationship with her and that I pushed her into that well,\" Michael said, not taking his eyes from me.</p><p>\"Is this for real, or some kind of joke?\" Grayson snapped. Taking a step closer to me, he added, \"Is this because my son went to prison for being in that fight? He's paid society for his crime. Anyway, who says the girl was pushed? There was an investigation at the time. It was an accident. The girl fell into the well. It would 'ave never happened if she hadn't been trespassing on me land.\"</p><p>How could I tell Grayson and Michael it was Molly who had told me she had been pushed? How could I explain she had told me in a dream I'd had about her being at the bottom of that well? How did I tell them I knew she had been meeting someone on their farm that night? I only knew that fact because of the statement my father had tried to bury, but which Vincent had discovered hidden away in the filing room back at the police station. If I said that, then I implicated my father.</p> <p>\"So c'mon, officer, tell us what makes you think that girl was pushed?\" Grayson demanded.</p><p>I looked at him, then at Michael. I felt a fool standing in their kitchen with a bunch of half-cocked theories. Theories I couldn't prove without making myself sound like a crazy bitch and telling them my father was bordering on committing police corruption, if he hadn't crossed that line already.</p><p>\"I think you should leave now,\" Michael said. He didn't sound angry, just disappointed and confused. I looked at him and could see the hurt in his eyes.</p><p>I looked at Grayson. \"So what were you doing last Wednesday afternoon?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Is this some kind of police interview?\" he grunted, rolling up the sleeves of his checked shirt to reveal his meaty forearms.</p><p>\"Please could you answer the question, Mr. Grayson,\" I shot back.</p> <p>\"I can't remember,\" he said, pushing out his chest defiantly and rolling back his powerful-looking shoulders. \"What has it got to do with you anyway?\"</p><p>\"Sydney believes it was you who killed that family out on the road the other day.\"</p><p>With his eyes bulging in their sockets like two large rocks, Grayson looked at his son, then back at me. \"What!\" he gasped. \"What do you mean I was involved in killing those people?\"</p><p>\"You disliked them enough,\" I said. \"You told me that they were witches and nothing but vermin.\"</p><p>\"Just because I didn't like their kind, it don't make me no killer,\" Grayson said, sounding flabbergasted. \"What you say and what you do are two completely different things. You didn't know them. They were strange - the lot of them. The old guy was the worst. You could barely understand a word he said, mixing all his words up and such. He sounded like that cartoon character Elmer Fudd, for Christ's sake,\" Grayson mocked.</p><p>\"Just because people are different - strange - as you like to put it,\" I said, \"doesn't make them bad people.\"</p><p>\"I didn't kill them!\" Grayson roared.</p><p>\"So how did you come by those dents and scratches on your four-by-four?\" I quizzed.</p> <p>\"So that's what this is all about?\" he sneered. \"Can't live with the fact that it was you who killed those people, so you come snooping around here looking for someone else to blame?\"</p><p>\"How did you get those dents?\" I shot back.</p><p>With a look of exasperation on his face, Grayson leapt forward and gripped my arm. He shoved me across the kitchen and yanked open the kitchen door. It was twilight outside, and the sky was so overcast with bluish-black clouds, it looked like a piece of bruised and battered skin.</p><p>\"I'll show you how I came by those dents and scratches,\" he huffed, frogmarching me down the short, overgrown lane, past the parked 4X4, and to the wide gate which barred anyone from driving onto his property. \"Look! Look! Look!\" Grayson barked, pointing at the gate frame with one thick, grubby-looking finger.</p><p>I pulled my arm free of his strong grip and looked at where he was pointing. At once, my heart sank and I felt foolish. The gate post was dented inwards, leaning to one side where it had been struck. I could see that the bend in the metal frame was at the height consistent with being hit by the cattle grill on the front of his 4X4.</p><p>\"What have you got to say about that?\" He glared at me. \"Mm?\"</p><p>What did I have to say to that? What did I have to say about any of it? I looked at Grayson, then at Michael, who was now standing behind his father. Again he stared at me with that same look of bewilderment and hurt in his eyes.</p><p>What had I done? I just wanted to curl up and crawl away.</p><p>\"So what have you got to say for yourself?\" Grayson boomed, unwilling to let me off the hook, even though he had proved me wrong and left me feeling humiliated.</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" I whispered. What else could I say? It would seem I'd screwed up, yet again.</p><p>\"Sorry don't cut it,\" he breathed just inches from my face. \"How dare you come onto my land and start making these wild accusations against me and my son! How dare you!\"</p><p>\"Sorry,\" I whispered again, unable to force myself to meet his stare.</p><p>\"I've got a good mind to ring your father and make an official complaint about police harassment,\" he threatened.</p><p>\"Cut her some slack, dad,\" Michael said, coming to my rescue. \"I'm sure Sydney didn't mean anything by it. I guess it's been a difficult time for her lately - it can't be an easy thing to come to terms with - what, with killing those people and all.\"</p><p>\"Well, she better learn to live with it,\" Grayson sniffed.</p><p>\"C'mon, dad, you've said your piece, let her be,\" Michael said, trying to coax his father back towards the farmhouse.</p><p>Grayson looked at Michael then back at me. \"Okay,\" he huffed. \"But I'm warning you, if I see you back on my land, I'm going to make sure you lose your badge. Call yourself a copper? God only knows what your father must think of you? What a joke!\"</p><p>Grayson turned his wide back on me and stomped away, leaving Michael and me alone.</p><p>\"I'm sorry about that,\" he said.</p><p>Looking at him, all I could see was sadness in his eyes. \"You have nothing to be sorry for, Michael,\" I said.</p><p>Turning my back on him, I walked slowly away. I didn't look back once. I couldn't. Feeling foolish and ashamed, I headed back down the road towards town. How could I have been so stupid? I guess I'd been so desperate to pass the blame.</p><p>You never face up to your responsibilities, I heard my father whisper in my ear. You need to start taking responsibility for your actions. You're not a little girl anymore.</p><p>Feeling sick, I lowered my head in shame. As I reached the spot where the accident had taken place - where I had killed those people - I looked up to see Vincent standing next to his bike, propped against the wall. He was smoking a cigarette. It was almost dark now, and Vincent stood in the cold, blowing out jets of smoke from his nose.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" he asked, stepping away from the wall and pushing the bike towards me.</p><p>\"No,\" I whispered, not stopping but walking straight past him.</p><p>\"Where are you going, Sydney?\" he called after me.</p><p>\"To see my mum,\" I snapped.</p><p>\"I'll walk with you,\" he said, catching up.</p><p>\"What, all the way to Spain?\" I said, walking into the darkness which lay ahead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Spain?\" Vincent said, following me into my apartment.</p><p>We had walked in silence on the way back from the farm, both of us lost to our thoughts. I felt stupid for daring to go up to the Grayson farm and accuse both Michael and his father of being killers. I must have lost my freaking mind. Then again, what else is new? Hadn't I spent the last few days or more dreaming of dead people? Chasing ghosts! Maybe that was the curse Jonathan Smith had cast upon me when he had called me a witch? Maybe Grayson was right - the Smiths had been nothing more than a family of witches? I'd been cursed to go out of my tiny little mind. To spend the rest of my life dreaming about them until I went insane?</p><p>I pulled off my coat and dropped it onto the sofa. I heard Vincent close the front door and come into the living room. He looked at me.</p><p>\"Spain?\" he said again, obviously still mulling over what I had said out on the road. \"You can't go to Spain.\"</p> <p>\"Why not?\" I said, looking back at him.</p><p>\"Because I'll miss you,\" he said half-jokingly.</p><p>\"You'll be the only one who will,\" I said, bursting into tears.</p><p>\"Hey, hey, hey,\" Vincent hushed, crossing the room and taking me in his arms. \"Why are you so upset?\"</p><p>\"Because I'm losing my freaking mind, that's why,\" I sobbed against him. \"I wish I had never gone back to the farm that day, I wish I'd never been anywhere near that road. I wish I'd never killed those people.\"</p> <p>\"I thought you said you hadn't?\" he whispered, holding me tight.</p><p>\"That was just me wishful thinking...\"</p><p>\"But what about those tyre marks and...\" Vincent tried to comfort me.</p><p>\"Like you said,\" I whispered, easing myself out of his arms, \"they could have been left by anyone at any time. The mystery cow...\" I tried to joke, but it was no good, and the tears started to flow again.</p><p>\"Don't upset yourself, Sydney,\" Vincent said, wrapping his arm about my shoulder and easing me down to sit on the edge of the sofa.</p><p>\"I'm such a mess,\" I cried.</p> <p>\"I think you're beautiful,\" he whispered, softly brushing the hair from my face with his fingertips.</p><p>\"I wasn't talking about my hair,\" I sniffed. \"I was talking about how I feel inside. I always do the wrong thing. However hard I try, I screw up. I just want someone to be proud of me.\"</p><p>\"Your father, you mean?\" Vincent said, as if being able to see right inside me - understand me.</p><p>I slowly nodded my head, tears flowing freely down my face now.</p><p>\"If he can't see what an amazing daughter he has, then it's your father's loss,\" he said, pulling me close so my head came to rest against his shoulder. \"We all make mistakes, no one is perfect.\"</p><p>\"How do you know I'm amazing?\" I said, trying to control the flood of tears. \"You don't know anything about me.\"</p><p>\"I know you're a kind person,\" Vincent whispered. \"I know you care about things.\"</p><p>\"How?\" I asked him.</p> <p>\"Because I can see how tormented you are about those people who died,\" he said, taking my face gently in his hands and looking at me. \"Most people couldn't give a damn about them. They were just nobodies. To you - even though you didn't know them - you're suffering because of what happened. And I don't think it's just guilt. You know that a wrong has been done and you know it has to be put right.\"</p><p>\"I'd been drinking,\" I suddenly said. \"The day I killed those people I'd been up at the farmhouse with Michael. We fooled about a bit and I had some whiskey. The control room was trying to raise me on the radio and I knew my father would be out looking for me. I panicked. I ran from that house, I was speeding and not concentrating on the road as I was too busy looking for gum to mask the smell of whiskey on my breath. It was then...it was then.... oh, God I'm so sorry for what I've done...\" I bent forward, racked with uncontrollable sobs.</p><p>Vincent eased me up into his arms again. \"Shhh...\" he whispered.</p><p>\"I have to tell you this,\" I cried. \"I can't lie anymore. I can't bear it. My father, Mac, and Woody covered for me. They lied just like they lied about Molly and what really happened that night. My father believed he was helping me, but it's killing me inside. I'm dreaming of dead people, running around the place pointing the finger at innocent people. I just wanted to be a good cop...I just wanted my father to be proud of me for once...\"</p><p>Holding me in his arms, Vincent looked into my eyes and said softly, \"Being a good copper isn't just about turning up for work on time, wearing a clean shirt, walking around in the shiniest of boots, and demanding people's respect. It's about doing the right thing by the people we serve - despite what they look like, who they are, and where they come from and how they choose to live their lives. Deep down, you know that, Sydney. That's why you're struggling now. You know it was wrong to lie about the Smith family and how they really died. That's why you're searching for the truth - because you know that's what counts. All that matters at the end of the day is the truth. Without the truth, the Smith family will never have justice they deserve.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" I whispered through my tears.</p><p>\"And as for your father not being proud of you,\" Vincent said, \"he should be ashamed of himself. Not only is he your father, but your sergeant, too. He should never have put you in this situation. I bet he's lying awake at night, his dreams haunted by the Smith family. As your sergeant and father, he should have set an example...\"</p><p>\"He was just trying to help me...\" I started.</p><p>\"He was just trying to help himself,\" Vincent said.</p><p>\"I know you're right.\" I looked up at him. \"He was more interested in saving himself from being embarrassed by me. And knowing that hurts more than anything. To know that he is so ashamed of me, he would risk his career and...\"</p><p>\"He wasn't ashamed of you ten years ago,\" Vincent cut in. \"You weren't there that night your father, Mac, and Woody changed their statements to make Molly Smith look like she was out committing burglaries when, really, she was upset, desperate, and in search of the man she loved. They were police officers, if they couldn't have protected her in life, the least they could have done is protect her memory. Instead, they lied about that poor girl - made her look like a thief to protect whoever she had gone to meet that night. That isn't being a good copper. What they did isn't something to be proud of.\"</p><p>\"You're really angry about that, aren't you?\" I said, looking into Vincent's almost jet-black eyes. It wasn't just his eyes, his face had lost that boyish look and he suddenly looked older and drawn somehow. He looked how I felt, like he was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.</p><p>\"I'm angry for you,\" he said, looking away and standing up. \"I feel angry for all those good coppers who go into work every day wanting to make a difference. It's people like your father who ruin it for cops like us. How will the public ever have trust in us, if we don't even trust ourselves to do the right thing?\"</p><p>\"But what can I do?\" I said, knowing in my heart what Vincent said was true.</p><p>\"If you want those nightmares to go away, if you want to stop seeing dead people every time you close your eyes, you have to tell the truth,\" Vincent said.</p><p>\"But how do I prove it?\" I said. \"The statements have been submitted. The road has been cleared. The autopsies have been carried out.\"</p><p>\"What about the incident from ten years ago?\" Vincent said thoughtfully.</p><p>\"No one is seriously going to believe that a dead girl came to me in my sleep and told me she was pushed into that well,\" I said. \"They would lock me up, all right, but not in prison - more like the madhouse. We have no proof.\"</p><p>\"We have those altered statements,\" Vincent said.</p><p>\"We need more than that,\" I sighed. \"As we already know, statements have a nasty habit of going missing or being rewritten. If only we could find out who it was Molly Smith was going to meet that night.\"</p><p>\"Have any ideas?\" Vincent asked.</p><p>\"I thought I did,\" wiping the last of the tears from my face with the backs of my hands. \"But that was a mistake.\"</p><p>\"Perhaps we should sleep on it,\" Vincent</p><p>said thoughtfully.</p><p>\"Perhaps you're right,\" I said.</p><p>Lost deep in thought, and scratching his chin, Vincent headed towards the front door.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" I asked softly.</p><p>\"To get some sleep,\" he said, stopping short of the front door and looking back at me.</p><p>\"I don't want to be alone,\" I whispered. \"I don't want those nightmares to come. Don't go just yet. Stay for a while. I could cook you some supper. I've still got half a packet of Jammie Dodgers left.\"</p><p>\"Now you are twisting my arm,\" he smiled at me.</p><p>\"We could listen to some music,\" I suggested.</p><p>\"Like what?\" he said, stepping away from the door and coming back into the living room.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" I said, taking my iPod from the dock. \"Let me have a look.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I selected a track and placed the iPod back into the dock. There was a moment of silence before the track started.</p><p>In that silence, Vincent said, \"What song did you choose?\"</p><p>\"Shhh,\" I hushed softly, placing a finger against Vincent's lips.</p><p>Slowly, the song I Want To Know What Love Is by Mariah Carey filled the room. It was my turn to take Vincent in my arms. I pulled his coat from over his shoulders and held him close.</p> <p>\"I thought we were going to eat Jammie Dodgers?\" he whispered in my ear, his breath warm against my cheek.</p><p>I held him closer. Just like we had the night before, we swayed in each other's arms as the music swept around us. Again, those feelings of being needed washed over me. I felt safe in Vincent's arms and I realised I had never felt so much for someone so quickly before. Sure, I had felt an instant attraction to men in the past, but this was more than just mere attraction. I still didn't know what it was I liked - or felt for Vincent. But there was something and it felt new, like something I hadn't experienced before. Were these the first feelings of love I was feeling for him? That was impossible, right? No one fell in love that quickly - that stuff only ever happened in movies and books.</p><p>Vincent slowly ran his fingers through my hair. It wasn't a desperate grab or fumble, but slow, as if he were relishing the feel of each strand passing between his fingers. I looked up into his dark eyes. Vincent wasn't handsome, not like one of the pretty boys. He didn't have studs hanging out of his face, and wasn't hiding behind a skin of tattoos, like so many of the guys I'd been with before. However strange Vincent could be - I got the feeling he was just being himself. Maybe that's what I liked about him. Perhaps there was a secret confidence - belief in himself - hidden deep within, which I found attractive. Vincent hadn't pretended to be something that he wasn't - he had always been true to himself, however clumsy and shy he came across at times. There was no pretence - macho bullshit with Vincent. If he could be true to himself, wouldn't he then always be true to me?</p><p>The music continued to envelop us as we held onto each other. I thought of how he had held me last night. He had been true to his word. He had stayed with me all night long and kept the nightmares away. He hadn't taken the opportunity to take it any further. He had been happy just to hold me in his arms all night long. I remembered what it was he had said, just before I'd fallen asleep.</p><p>In his arms, and as we danced slowly to the music, I looked at him and said, \"What did you mean last night?\"</p> <p>\"What was that?\" he looked at me.</p><p>\"When you said, you knew what it feels like to be scared and alone?\" I said.</p><p>\"Let me ask you a question?\" he said, ignoring mine.</p><p>\"Okay,\" I said.</p><p>\"Why did you choose this song?\"</p><p>Pressing my cheek against his so I didn't have to look in his eyes, I sang softly along to the words of the song. \"I want to know what love is. I want you to show me.\"</p> <p>I felt my feet slowly lift off the floor as Vincent swept me up into his arms. With the song playing all around us, Vincent carried me into the bedroom and laid me gently on the bed. I pulled my sweater off and eased my jeans and panties over my hips and down my legs. I lay naked on the bed and watched him in the dim light that spilt into the room from behind the door. With his back to me, I watched Vincent take off his clothes. Although his body was lean, it was well-toned and muscular. His skin was pale. It was then I saw a crisscross of white scars over his shoulders and down his back. Although healed, I could see that at some point in his life, they must have caused him great pain.</p><p>\"Come here,\" I whispered, holding out my hand towards him.</p><p>Vincent turned, and naked, he came towards me. Taking his hand in mine, I gently eased him down onto the edge of the bed so he was sitting with his back to me. Slowly, I ran my fingers gently over the maze of raised scars that covered his back. I leant forward, and brushing my lips lightly over his skin, I kissed the scars. I wanted to take away the pain they must have caused him. Vincent sat in silence, his back straight, as the music bled in from the other room.</p><p>...In my life there has been heartache and pain...I don't know if I can face it again...the song continued.</p><p>\"What happened to you?\" I whispered, as I brushed my lips over his back.</p><p>Vincent reached round and took my hand in his. Looking at me in the semi-darkness, he said, \"It doesn't matter now,\" and laid me gently back onto the bed. Vincent leant over me, our noses almost touching, and it was then I noticed a jagged-looking scar running along the right side of his forehead, just beneath the hairline. I reached out, gently running my fingertips along the length of it. Vincent took my hand away, brought it up to his lips, and kissed my fingers. He slowly kissed each one, his eyes closed. He gradually worked his lips over the back of my hand, down the inside of my wrist, and along my forearm to the crook of my elbow. Each kiss felt like my skin was being caressed with a feather. He seemed to be taking his time, enjoying every moment. There was no rushing here. No frantic groping, pushing and pulling, and for the first time in my life, I didn't feel as if I had to take control of the situation. Vincent, in his own passive way, was very much in control. I closed my eyes and relished the touch of his lips as they slowly brushed over my breasts. I was enjoying Vincent taking his time, and I didn't want it to end.</p><p>I felt the tip of his tongue trail over the flat of my stomach, then he paused to breathe over that little wet trail he had left behind. My skin tingled, my stomach muscles tightened. With his hands, Vincent started to trace tiny circles on the tops of my thighs as he worked the tip of his tongue over my tiny patch of hair. I eased my legs slightly apart, just enough. Vincent sensed this, and with his fingertips still making skin-tingling circles now on the insides of my thighs, I felt the tip of his tongue roll gently down between my legs.</p><p>I sighed, and arching my back, I opened my legs just a little more. Vincent took advantage of this, and I felt the tip of his tongue enter me. I gripped the bed sheets with my fists. He moved his tongue slowly, almost deliberately, as if not wanting to rush, to savour and enjoy every moment. Not wanting it to end. Letting go of the sheets, I ran my fingers through his short, black hair.</p> <p>Vincent slowly withdrew his tongue and I groaned out loud. He brushed the tip of it over the inside of my right thigh, down the inside of my leg, my calf muscle, and then over the top of my foot. It was as if he didn't want to leave one part of my body untouched by him. No man had ever spent this much time caressing my body before. Gently, he rolled me onto my front, my hair spilling down my back. I felt Vincent's mouth again as he worked his way back up the length of my body, his tongue leaving a cool damp trail behind him. My flesh prickled with rising excitement as he covered my arse in kisses. Slowly, he slipped his fingers between my buttocks and between my legs. The tips of his fingers gently stroking the place where, minutes before, his tongue had been exploring. I pressed my face into the pillow to muffle my sighs of pleasure, as I felt his fingers slide slowly inside of me. He eased them in and out, the crown of his thumb making circular motions against my clit. He worked his thumb slowly, as if understanding how sensitive that part of my body was. Vincent knew how much pleasure he could bring me by touching me there. While he massaged me with his fingers, he leaned over and covered my back, shoulder, and neck with kisses. I turned my face against the pillow so I could see him. His face was just inches from mine. Not wanting to break the growing sensation he was building with his hand between my legs, I twisted my shoulders slightly, so my face was fully turned towards his. We kissed. His lips were firm but somehow still soft against mine. Vincent ran his tongue over my mouth, then slipped it gently between my lips. I could taste myself on him, and it excited me. With a gradual but ever-growing speed, Vincent continued to move his thumb in that circular motion as his fingers slid faster and faster inside of me.</p><p>A well of heat spread out from my stomach, warming every part of me. The music continued to play in the background as my heartbeat sped up, my fingertips and toes tingling with growing pleasure. With the heat, wetness, and feeling of unimaginable pleasure growing deep within me and between my legs, it became so consuming, that I had to break our kiss. I buried my face in the pillow again as every muscle in my body locked tight. The feeling of sexual pleasure was like nothing I had felt before, and I tried to hold onto it for as long as I could, my skin feeling as if it had been set alight. Suddenly, my body gave way to a series of turbulent spasms which rippled throughout me.</p><p>I screamed out, my back arching, drawing myself up onto my knees as I trembled and shook on all fours.</p><p>\"Vincent!\" I cried out. \"Please don't stop.\"</p><p>With my body still reeling from the aftershock of the orgasm that I'd had, Vincent rolled me onto my back, and pushed himself into me.</p><p>I cried out again, throwing my head back and arching my body so he could push himself deeper into me. Vincent groaned. Dropping onto his elbows, my legs locked around his back, he looked down into my face and said, \"I never want this to end, Sydney. I want to stay locked inside of you forever.\"</p><p>Looking up into his face, I wanted to tell him I loved him, but that was just stupid, right? I couldn't be in love with him. Wasn't I just in love with what he was doing to me? The music filtered in from the other room.</p><p>...I want to know what love is...I want you to show me...the song played all around us like a wall of sound, shutting the rest of the world out. It felt like it was only us who were truly alive at that moment in time. I didn't want to share it with anyone else other than Vincent.</p><p>Maybe the intense feeling I was sharing with him was love? I'd certainly never felt anything like this before. It was more than just lust, that needing, yearning to come - it felt deeper than that with Vincent. I felt a deep, overwhelming happiness inside, as strong as the feelings of sexual ecstasy which had just torn through me. Was it such a deep sense of happiness, love? If it was truly love, it was the first time in my life I had felt it. I couldn't tell Vincent that, however much I wanted to. I was too scared.</p><p>\"Hold me,\" I whispered, wrapping my arms around his back, pulling him deeper into me. \"Don't let go.\"</p><p>\"I won't,\" he said, moving himself back and forth on top of me. \"I won't ever let you go.\"</p><p>I ran my hands up and down his back, gripping his butt as it moved slowly but firmly up and down.</p><p>\"Harder,\" I whispered in his ear, smothering his shoulders, neck, and face in kisses.</p><p>\"You're so beautiful,\" he whispered back, his hips moving faster and harder.</p><p>That well of burning built within me again. I clung to him, wanting him. \"Harder! Faster!\" I cried.</p><p>Vincent pushed deeper into me, both of us now groaning. We clung to each other, our bodies hot and covered in a fine sheen of glistening sweat. The music seemed to grow louder as if competing with our cries of pleasure. It felt like the walls of the room were closing in on me, pressing us closer together. My head spun and my heart raced faster and faster in time with Vincent's rapidly increasing thrusts. That pit of heat in my stomach exploded outwards, making every one of my nerve endings seethe with life. I bucked beneath Vincent as my body convulsed uncontrollably.</p><p>\"I love you,\" he cried out.</p><p>\"I love you,\" I whispered breathlessly, as his whole body seemed to lock, then spasm in my arms.</p><p>\"You have no idea how long I've loved you, Sydney,\" he murmured as both our bodies weakened and we collapsed into one another's arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vincent rolled off me and onto his side. With our arms locked about each other, we looked into each other's eyes. I could feel his breath, warm against my cheek. Fine beads of sweat glistened on his brow, just below the jagged-looking scar, which now seemed to be fading in the dim light. My racing heart was still thumping in my chest and I felt breathless and warm all over. The music still played gently in the background, in some way soothing us now. Part of me half expected Vincent to jump up now, put his clothes back on, and leave. That's what usually happened with the others.</p><p>\"Aren't you going to leave now?\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Why would I want to leave when everything I want is right here in this room?\" he whispered back, brushing a stray strand of my hair from my face. It was like he didn't want anything to cover the view that he had of me. He wanted to see me completely.</p><p>\"Did you mean what you said?\" I asked him.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to leave you,\" he smiled.</p><p>\"I didn't mean that,\" I said, looking straight into his eyes, searching them for the truth.</p><p>\"What then?\" he asked.</p><p>\"When you said you loved me?\"</p><p>\"I love you, Sydney Hart,\" he whispered, leaning forward and planting a gentle kiss on my forehead.</p> <p>\"But how is that possible?\" I said, just above a whisper. \"People don't fall in love just like that, do they?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" he said thoughtfully. \"I've never been in love before.\"</p><p>\"So how, then, do you know its love you feel?\" I asked, not really questioning his feelings, but my own.</p><p>\"I'm not very good with words,\" he said. \"But the only way I can explain how I feel is that the thought of never seeing you...being like this with you again...hurts so much. I've never felt like that before and...\" he trailed off.</p><p>\"And?\" I pushed gently.</p><p>\"You're the first person who hasn't laughed at me...treated me like a fool because I can be awkward at times, and I know everything I say doesn't always come out just how I meant it...you know that can hurt...\"</p> <p>\"Why would I want to laugh at you?\" I said.</p><p>\"Plenty do,\" he sighed. \"People think I'm the fool guy - they don't take me seriously. It's just like being at work. Straight away I've been relocated to filing instead of patrol, been given the old push-bike. No one thinks I can cut being a copper so they try and hide me away, relegate me to the broom cupboard. It's like that song People are Strange by The Doors. When you're strange...no one remembers your name,\" Vincent quoted.</p><p>To hear him talk reminded me of myself. No one had any faith in me, either. I knew how much that could hurt. I thought Vincent's pain went deeper than just an emotional level.</p><p>Running my fingertips gently over the scars covering his shoulder, I said, \"How did you get these scars?\"</p><p>\"Someone hurt me once,\" he said, never taking his eyes from mine. \"They hurt me real bad.\"</p><p>\"What did they do?\" I breathed. \"Who was it?\"</p><p>\"It doesn't matter now. That life is over,\" he said, holding me tighter in his arms. \"I have a new life now.\"</p><p>With my head nestled against his chest, I listened to the sound of his heart beating gently. \"Did you mean what you said?\" he suddenly whispered.</p> <p>I knew what he was talking about. \"Yes,\" I whispered back.</p><p>\"So how do you know if it's the real thing?\" he asked.</p><p>Lifting my head off his chest, I looked at him and said, \"To be honest, Vincent, I don't know. What I do know is, I have never felt anything like this before.\"</p><p>\"How does it feel?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Like I'm not alone, if that makes sense?\" I said. \"With other guys, even though I've been with them, there has still been a part of me that has felt alone...empty. Like you, Vincent, I guess I've been searching for someone to love me for who I am - rather than what they think I am or what I think I should be. Am I making any sense?\"</p><p>\"Perfect sense,\" he smiled at me. \"I knew from the very first moment I met you, I'd found someone who liked me for just being me.\"</p><p>\"How did you know?\" I smiled back at him.</p><p>\"Because you didn't tell me to piss off when you saw how badly my dancing was,\" he laughed.</p><p>\"You are a pretty bad dancer,\" I laughed back. \"For a moment I did actually think you were throwing a fit or something.\"</p><p>\"What else did you think?\" he smiled, stroking the side of my face with his thumb.</p><p>\"I thought you were probably the craziest guy I'd ever met,\" I said. \"You do the strangest of things at times - but are the most caring and honest man I've ever met...\"</p><p>\"Caring? Honest?\" he smiled.</p><p>\"What you said earlier about being a cop and making sure always to do the right thing - to try and make a difference,\" I reminded him. \"You really care about people - you really want to help people. You really want to help Molly Smith. Even though she is dead, you want to help get justice for her. That says a lot about a person. That says a lot about you, Vincent.\"</p><p>\"Do you think?\" he asked, sounding unsure.</p><p>\"To stand by your convictions, even though there will be plenty of people who wished you hadn't, takes a lot of courage. Only a strong person can do that,\" I said. Looking away, I added, \"That's the difference between people like you and me. I didn't have the strength to stand up to my father. When he suggested the idea of covering for me, I should have told him no. I should have torn up the statement he brought around here. I should have been strong enough to face the truth, whatever that meant for me and my future.\"</p><p>\"And we will...you will,\" he said.</p><p>\"But how?\" I said, slipping from his arms and sitting up. \"We have no proof about what really happened to Molly Smith.\"</p><p>\"There must be something we're missing,\" Vincent said. \"It's probably staring us right in the face.\"</p><p>I sat looking through the gap in the bedroom door and into my living room. \"It is staring me straight in the face,\" I suddenly whispered, looking at the empty Coke bottle with the note Vincent had left on the coffee table for me.</p><p>\"What is it?\" Vincent said, sitting up next to me on the bed.</p><p>\"I dreamt of a message in a bottle,\" I breathed, turning to look at him. \"In one of my nightmares, when I was standing at the bottom of the well, there was a bottle floating in the dirty rainwater.\"</p><p>\"So?\" Vincent frowned.</p><p>\"When I went looking for that well,\" I started to explain, \"I knew I'd found the right one, because just like in my nightmare, there was a bottle with a folded piece of paper sealed inside.\"</p><p>\"So you think it's connected to what happened to Molly?\" he said, staring at me.</p><p>\"What are the chances of me dreaming about that bottle, only to discover one floating in the well?\" I gasped, clambering from the bed. \"Perhaps Molly was trying to show it to me. Perhaps that piece of paper inside is a message from her? Perhaps it has the name of the person who pushed her into that well written on it.\"</p><p>\"That's a bit farfetched...\" Vincent said rationally.</p><p>\"Hey,\" I said, pulling my clothes back on. \"I thought it was you who said we had ourselves an X-File!\"</p><p>\"I know, but...\" Vincent said, starting to put on his uniform again.</p><p>\"Just come with me and take a look at the bottle,\" I said. \"If it turns out to be just a piece of litter that's been tossed into the well, I promise I will go and see my father first thing in the morning and tell him I want to withdraw my statement about the crash.\"</p><p>\"But it's gone one-thirty in the morning,\" Vincent said, glancing at the bedside clock. \"Can't we go and take a look tomorrow?\"</p><p>\"I can't go up to that farm in daylight,\" I said. \"If old farmer Grayson catches me on his land again, he's gonna have my badge.\"</p><p>\"That bottle is at the bottom of a well,\" Vincent said, pulling on his boots. \"How are we going to climb down to the bottom and get it? We don't have any rope or...\"</p><p>\"I know where we can find some rope,\" I smiled at him, heading for the front door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I could remember seeing a huge length of rope hanging in the barn on Grayson's farm. I saw it the day I had led Michael into the barn, it was hanging by the door, next to the neat rows of tools. So, with our torches on, Vincent and I made our way along the desolate shore, to the coastal path and through the crop of trees to Grayson's farm. We didn't reach the brow of the hill until nearly gone two o'clock in the morning. There was no moon, as the sky was full of cloud, and the first cold drops of rain had started to fall.</p><p>\"We should turn off our torches,\" I whispered to Vincent as we stepped clear of the trees and into the rain.</p><p>\"Okay,\" Vincent whispered back, switching off his torch and throwing us in to near darkness.</p><p>The wind whooped and howled across the fields, ruffling my hair and making the collar of Vincent's police coat flap like a sail against his throat. The tree branches creaked and swayed behind us, the sound of the rain now drumming against the canopy of leaves.</p> <p>\"This way,\" I said, setting off down the hill towards the barn which stood below us like a dark smudge in the night.</p><p>The rain fell harder now, falling horizontally across our path in the wind. Our boots sloshed and squelched through the muddy earth. It was cold, but I daren't put my hands in my pockets for fear of slipping on the mud and being unable to break my fall. Vincent walked beside me, plumes of breath billowing from our lungs and disappearing into the cold night sky like tiny wisps of cloud. Apart from the roaring wind and the sound of the driving rain beating off the ground, the world seemed eerily silent.</p><p>We reached the foot of the hill, and I could see that the farmhouse, which was a short distance away, was in darkness. There were no lights on that I could see, and no smoke tumbling up from the chimney. I guessed that both Michael and his father were asleep. Had I treated Michael too harshly because of what he'd done? I wondered. I pushed the thought away. I hadn't come here to think about him. I had come to retrieve that bottle from the bottom of the well. Nothing must distract me from that.</p><p>I looked at Vincent, who stood beside me in the dark, rain running down his face like tears. I nodded in the direction of the barn, not daring to speak now for fear of being discovered. God only knew what Grayson would do, should he wake to find me trespassing on his land in the middle of the night. Vincent followed me the short distance to the barn. I looked at him, took a deep breath, then pulled at the door. It was heavy. Vincent curled his fingers around the handle and together we pulled it open, then all hell broke loose. Jess leapt out of the darkness at us like a giant hound. It barked and yapped, its giant-looking paws in the air.</p><p>Vincent instantly gripped my arm and yanked me backwards out of the dog's path. The farmer's dog barked and woofed, the sound deafening in the silent night. I glanced sideways at the farmhouse and saw one of the bedroom lights come on.</p> <p>\"Shit!\" I hissed. \"Someone's woken up.\"</p><p>\"Look,\" Vincent whispered. \"The dog isn't coming any closer. It's been tied up.\"</p><p>I looked back towards the open barn door and could see Jess was secured inside the barn with a chain that was fastened to her collar. Old farmer Grayson must have been using her as some sort of guard dog.</p><p>\"We should go,\" I gasped, seeing that one of the downstairs lights had now been switched on in the farmhouse.</p><p>\"This is our only chance of getting that bottle,\" Vincent wheeled on me, his eyes big and dark. \"I'll see to the dog, you fetch that rope you told me about.\" Then, heading back towards the barn door, Vincent started to coo at Jess. The dog barked at him, then mellowed as Vincent took a half-eaten pack of Jammie Dodgers from his coat pocket and tossed one towards the dog.</p><p>Bent double, trying to make myself as small as possible, I raced towards the open door and slipped inside. Jess didn't even look at me, as she woofed up the biscuit from the ground and ran a giant pink tongue over her snout. I reached around the inside of the door, feeling for the rope in the darkness. My fingers raced blindly over the set of tools, spilling from their housing, sending them clattering to the floor.</p> <p>\"Shhh!\" Vincent snapped, looking back over his shoulder at the farmhouse, then back at me. \"Hurry up, Sydney!\"</p><p>My fingers found the rope and they curled around it. I yanked it from the wall and nearly fell over. The rope was heavier than I had expected.</p><p>\"Come here,\" Vincent said, rushing over to me. He bent down, picked up the rope, and hoisted it over his shoulder. \"Now let's just get outter here.\"</p><p>I pushed my butt against the barn door, desperate to hide our tracks, as Vincent set off back up the hill towards the well. There was a rattling sound as the lock was pulled back on the farmhouse door. I heard it swing open, followed by the deep, booming voice of Grayson.</p><p>\"What's wrong, girl? Who's out there?\"</p><p>Hearing her master's voice, Jess started howling and barking all over again. With the sound of Grayson's huffing and puffing drawing closer, I slinked around the side of the barn and raced up the hill and into the darkness. Vincent had climbed about halfway by the time I'd caught up with him. His breathing sounded heavy and laboured as he struggled with the rope. The rain was lashing down now, and progress up the hill was becoming treacherous. The mud had become as slippery as ice, and every step we took had to be carefully made, which slowed our escape. The rope had become wet, too, and it slipped around Vincent's shoulders like a giant snake.</p><p>I looked back into the darkness and could just make out Grayson's outline, silhouetted in the light flooding from his open front door. I could hear Jess barking wildly. I couldn't see any sign of Michael. I turned away, and was grateful there was no moon tonight. I slunk into the darkness and followed Vincent up the hill and to the well.</p><p>I reached the top to find Vincent drawing deep mouthfuls of damp, cold air into his lungs. I helped him lift the rope from about his shoulders.</p> <p>\"I just hope it will be long enough to reach the bottom,\" he breathed, peering through the darkness and into the well.</p><p>\"I hope the bottle is still down there,\" I whispered over the sound of Jess yapping in the distance. I prayed that Grayson hadn't seen either of us clambering away up the hill. I couldn't use the torch as it would have been like a beacon going off in the night at the top of the hill. Fearing that our time was short, I looked at Vincent and said, \"Let's just get this over with.\"</p><p>Vincent snatched up one end of the rope, and trampling through the mud and rain, he wrapped one end of the rope around the nearest tree trunk. He fastened the end with a knot. \"The rope's too wet. The knot might just slip apart again as soon as any weight is put on it. You wait up here for me, and hold onto the rope, whatever you do.\"</p><p>Taking the rope from his hands, I looped the free end of it around my waist.</p><p>\"What do you think you're doing?\" he hissed from the darkness.</p><p>\"I have to go and get that bottle,\" I whispered.</p><p>\"Why?\" Vincent snapped, trying to take the rope from me. \"It's way too dangerous.\"</p><p>\"Molly showed me that bottle in my dream,\" I tried to reason with him. \"If the bottle is at the bottom of the well, and it's the same one, then she showed it to me for a reason. She showed it to me, Vincent, not you. I have to go and get it.\"</p><p>\"But...\" he started to protest.</p><p>Cutting over him, I said, \"You keep hold of the rope. When I've got the bottle, I'll yank on the rope and you can pull me out. Okay?\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" he said reluctantly. I guessed he knew we didn't have time to stand and argue about who was going to venture down into the well.</p><p>With the rope feeling as tight as it could be around my waist, I clambered up onto the edge of the well. Rain fell hard all around me and I could hear it drumming onto the water at the foot of the well, deep below me. I looked over the edge. It looked like a yawning throat of darkness. Taking a deep breath and my heart racing, I swung my legs over the edge of the well.</p><p>\"Are you sure about this?\" Vincent breathed.</p><p>\"No,\" I said, looking back at him. \"But I know it's something I have to do.\"</p><p>\"Be careful,\" Vincent said, taking up the slack in the rope and leaning back. His boots slid momentarily in the sodden mud.</p><p>\"Okay?\" I asked, watching him regain his footing before I climbed in to the darkness.</p><p>\"Okay,\" he answered back.</p><p>Taking one last glance at Vincent, I turned, then slowly climbed into the well. I gripped the rope as it slid wetly through my fingers. The well stank of mildew and damp. Rain water ran down the walls which circled me. The rope gave a little, and slowly, Vincent lowered me down into the well. It was so dark now inside, that it became almost impossible to see my own hands gripping the rope. I glanced down and could see nothing but a inking well of black. I had no idea how far I was from the bottom or even if we had enough rope to get me there.</p><p>Inch by inch, Vincent lowered me from above. For one frightening moment, I pictured Jonathan and Molly Smith waiting in the darkness for me. I looked down and gasped. Was that their pale, white hands reaching out of the darkness? Their fingers snapping at my heels, desperate to pull me down into the black? I closed my eyes momentarily, then opened them again. There were no hands, just darkness and the sound of the rain water running down the walls which surrounded me.</p><p>Witch! I suddenly heard someone whisper.</p><p>Stop it! I told myself. But still my heart raced frantically in my chest and my mouth went dry. My tongue felt suddenly thick and swollen, as if I were suffocating. The deeper Vincent lowered me into the well, the closer the walls seemed to be all around me. I had to fight the urge to scream out to Vincent. To tell him that I couldn't bear it anymore - that I couldn't breathe - that I was suffocating. I closed my eyes again and drew in several lungfuls of damp, cold air. I felt my heart slow, just a little as I fought desperately to keep myself from totally freaking out. I opened my eyes again, but I might as well have just kept them closed. The darkness which now surrounded me was thick, suffocating, and impenetrable. I wondered what it must have been like for Molly and that police officer named Lee to have died in this blackness. It must have been like falling into hell.</p><p>Suddenly, I felt the toes of my boots brush against something solid. My boots came to rest and I realised I had reached the bottom of the well. Knowing now that I was so deep below ground that I could have some light, I fumbled in my coat pocket for my torch. I held it in my hands and they began to tremble. Even though I was desperate for some light, I suddenly became fearful of switching it on. I was suddenly petrified of what I might see, of what might be waiting for me in the darkness. Would Jonathan and Molly Smith be waiting for me, just like they had been in my nightmares? Would the old guy come stumbling - twitching and jerking - out of the darkness at me? Would I be able to hear the sound of that flap of flesh slapping wetly against the side of his face as he whispered, Witch! Witch! Witch! over and over again?</p><p>With my heart racing, hands trembling, and my legs threatening to buckle beneath me at any moment, I switched on my torch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sudden light was so bright in the dark, at first it was blinding. I closed my eyes and saw a mass of bright white spots on the inside of my eyelids. Slowly, I opened them again peered about the well. The walls were charcoal grey and slimy-looking. Rainwater ran down them in glistening rivulets. Once my eyes had grown accustomed to the light, I span around in the confined enclosure to make sure that I was truly alone. There was no one in the well with me. This fact didn't stop my heart from racing. To be at the bottom of the well was like reliving my nightmare again. It was the exact same well. The smell, the damp, the Plink! Plink! Plink! sound of dripping water.</p><p>\"Water!\" I gasped.</p><p>I looked down to see that I was standing in a foot of it. Just like in my nightmare, it was black, like a deep pool of ink. I flashed the light of my torch over it, in search of the bottle.</p><p>\"Where is it?\" I groaned, unable to see it, fearing that I had put myself at risk for nothing.</p> <p>The torchlight made sparkling patterns over the water as I splashed about, the feeling that the walls were closing in on me again. I saw something winking back at me from just a few feet away in the water. I waded forwards, plucking the bottle from the water like I was grabbing some kind of prize. I held the old Coke bottle up in the torchlight. The red and white logo had almost come totally away, and what was left had faded to a pale pinkie colour through age. I shone the light on the bottle, and there, sealed inside, was a folded piece of a paper. Holding the end of the torch between my front teeth, and with a pair of trembling hands, I unscrewed the cap. I placed the empty bottle in my coat pocket, then unfolded the piece of paper. It had turned yellow in places and the corners had curled up. With my free hand, I took the torch from between my front teeth, and held it over the sheet of paper.</p><p>At once my heart almost stopped, and I drew a deep, agonising breath as I read what was written in a spidery scrawl across it. To read that note was like being repeatedly punched in the stomach. I felt winded, as if unable to fill my lungs with air. I reached for the wall of the well to support me as my legs gave way beneath. I dropped into the water, as it splashed darkly about me.</p><p>\"No,\" I cried out. \"No!\"</p><p>I didn't want to believe what was written on the note I had discovered. But in my heart I knew that it was true. It was the only thing that made any sense.</p><p>\"No!\" I screamed, rocking my head back against the wall. \"No!\"</p> <p>Hot acid shot up into my throat, and I gaged. I felt sick. A part of me wanted to turn off the torch and sit in the black at the bottom of the well and never climb out again.</p><p>\"How could you do this to me!\" I screamed, kicking at the water with my feet and banging my fists against the wall. I screwed the letter up in my fist as I pounded the wall over and over again. From the corner of my tear-filled eyes, I saw the letter getting ever more creased. Slowly, I stopped. I couldn't destroy it. I couldn't destroy the letter if I was going to ever have justice for those people who had died in the well.</p><p>Shaking from head to foot, I dragged myself out of the water and lent against the slick grey wall of the well. I looked one last time at the note which had been signed: This is the dying declaration of Police Constable Lee 5013.</p><p>I yanked on the rope to give the sign to Vincent that I was ready to be pulled up. I put the note back into the bottle and tucked it into my coat pocket. I switched off the torch, then gripped the rope as Vincent began to pull me up out of the well. With my head resting against the rope, I wondered how I would even begin to explain to Vincent what I had discovered. Slowly, I reached the top, feeling cold, wet, and in shock. I gripped the edge of the well to hoist myself out. I felt a cold pair of hands take hold of mine. I looked up expecting to see Vincent, but instead I was looking into my father's face. He pulled me over the lip of the well, and I staggered away, my legs still feeling like two sticks of rubber.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" I gasped, glancing through the driving rain in search of Vincent. I couldn't see him anywhere.</p><p>\"What am I doing here?\" my father barked at me. \"I should be arresting you for the continual harassment of Farmer Grayson, and for repeatedly trespassing on his land. He called the three 9s claiming that thieves were on his property. I was on patrol close by. The last person I thought I would find is you!\"</p> <p>I knocked the strands of wet hair away, which were plastered across my face, and stared at my father.</p><p>\"What is wrong with you, Sydney?\" he shouted, coming towards me through the rain.</p><p>\"Don't touch me!\" I screamed back at him. \"Don't you dare come near me - murderer!\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"What are you talking about?\" my father snapped as he came towards me through the dark. \"Have you lost your mind?\"</p><p>\"It's not me who has lost their fucking mind. It's you!\" I screeched at him.</p><p>\"Sydney,\" he said, his voice seeming to soften now.</p><p>\"Keep away from me!\" I warned him, holding up the flat of my hand. \"Don't come near me.\" I glanced around in the dark again for Vincent, but still couldn't see him. Where was he? Was he listening to this? I was in danger here.</p> <p>\"What's this all about?\" my father tried to reason with me. \"Does it have something to do with those people you killed?\"</p><p>\"It has to do with who you killed,\" I hissed at him. \"Who you murdered!\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" he said, staring at me, rain dripping from his police cap and raincoat.</p><p>\"You murdered a police officer...\" I stammered. Even I couldn't believe that I was accusing my father of murdering a police officer. \"You killed Constable Lee.\"</p><p>My father's eyes grew wide, and now it was him who looked like he had taken a blow to the guts. \"You don't know what you're talking about, you silly bitch,\" he growled.</p> <p>\"Don't I?\" I screamed at him, curling my fingers around the bottle which was still hidden in my pocket. \"I know all about what you did that night ten years ago. I know what you and your buddies, Mac and Woody, did to that girl...what you did to Constable Lee.\"</p><p>\"You don't know what you're talking...\"</p><p>\"You changed your statements!\" I screamed at him, making my hands into fists. \"I thought you changed them to protect the person Molly Smith was coming to meet that night. But you changed them to protect yourselves...to cover up what you did to her.\"</p><p>\"We didn't do anything to that filthy little...\" he started to bark.</p><p>\"You found her distraught and crying on the road that night,\" I started to remind him. \"But instead of helping her...taking her home...you and your buddies dragged her into the back of your police van and touched her...\" I could hardly bring myself to say the words. \"You tried to hurt her, but Constable Lee stopped you, he helped her escape. Like animals, you went after her. Because she meant nothing to you.\"</p><p>\"Sydney...\" my father started, and even in the darkness, I could see his face had turned as white as paper, and his eyes wide with rage. I wouldn't let him talk. I didn't want to listen to his lies - to his bullshit.</p> <p>\"Jesus, Dad,\" I glared. \"Molly Smith was not a lot younger than me. She was somebody's daughter. She was Jonathan Smith's daughter. That's why you did what you did. That's why you didn't help her, because she didn't deserve your help. Just because her family chose to live their lives differently from everyone else - just because they looked and dressed differently, you hounded her through the woods like a pack of wild animals, fearing that she would be able to tell others about what you had done.\"</p><p>\"Stop this!\" my father roared, his voice sounding high-pitched and a little scared.</p><p>Ignoring him, I said, \"But by the time you had found her, she was in the bottom of the well. I bet you couldn't believe your luck! You were going to leave her there - to be found sometime later. Constable Lee had the courage to stand up to you! He had the guts to say 'No'! He wanted to help her. You and your buddies refused. So he decided to climb down into the well to save her. You couldn't have that - he was a cop who just wanted to do the right thing. So when he was standing on the wall of that well, you pushed him in. You murdered him!\"</p><p>My father stood motionless in the dark, the brim of his cap covering his eyes in darkness now. The only thing I could clearly see was his thick, black moustache covering his top lip.</p><p>Clapping his hands slowly together, he said in a cold, emotionless voice, \"So how do you intend on proving this, Sydney? You have no evidence.\"</p><p>Slowly, I took the bottle from my pocket and said, \"I have the dying declaration of that police officer. The police officer who you pushed into the well.\"</p><p>My father glanced at the bottle and didn't say anything.</p><p>\"As he lay dying at the bottom of the well, he took a sheet of paper from his pocket notebook and scribbled down what really happened that night. He tucked the note into a bottle, hoping and praying that one day, it would be discovered.</p> <p>\"Is that all you have?\" my father mocked with a chuckle. \"That could have been written by anyone. It could have been written by you, Sydney.\"</p><p>I looked at the bottle, then back at him. I knew my father was right. He slowly came towards me, his hand outstretched, ready to snatch the bottle from me. I stood in the rain, rigid, unable to move.</p><p>\"Give the bottle to me, Sydney,\" he whispered.</p><p>Suddenly someone spoke from the shadows of the nearby trees. \"Don't give him the bottle, Sydney.\"</p><p>Both my father and I snapped our heads around in the direction of the voice.</p><p>A figure stepped slowly from beneath the trees, and looking at my father, the voice said, \"Sydney has a witness. I saw you push the police officer into the well that night.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Michael?\" I breathed, watching him step from the shadows and out into the clearing by the well. \"What are you doing out here?\"</p><p>With his dark hair wet and tousled-looking as it swept off his brow in the roaring wind, Michael said, \"I'm sorry I lied to you, Sydney, but I just can't go on keeping secrets. It's killing me inside.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" I asked, staring at him.</p><p>\"It was me Molly had come to meet that night,\" he said, looking at me, then at my father. \"We were in love, but because of people like your father standing here, and my own, we had to keep that relationship a secret. I loved her with all of my heart. I wanted nothing more than to be with her. But like your father, I was a coward and feared what people like my father and yours would say about me - think of me - if I was in love with such a girl. So I arranged to meet Molly out here that night. She came and I told her I didn't love her, and that I never wanted to see her again.\"</p> <p>\"Why didn't you tell me this?\" I asked, seeing the pain in his eyes.</p><p>\"Because of what I saw out here that night,\" he said, glancing at me, then back at my father. \"When I told Molly that I couldn't be with her, she ran crying into the trees and down onto the road. I thought she was heading home. I waited up here in the dark, angry with myself and others. A short time later, I heard someone running back through the trees and towards the well. It was Molly. Her clothes were torn and I had never seen anyone look so scared. I took hold of her and she fought with me, screaming and scratching as if I was going to hurt her in some way. It was like, in her blind panic and in the darkness, she thought I was someone else. She pulled free of me, and in doing so, she toppled back over the wall and into the well. In terror I called out her name, but she made no noise. It was then I heard the sounds of others approaching through the trees. I could see the flashing lights from torches and the sound of radios. I knew it was the police. Fearing that they might suspect me of pushing Molly into the well, and still desperate to hide the fact that we had been lovers, I slunk back into the shadows amongst the trees and hid.\"</p><p>As Michael was talking, I glanced over at my father and could see the drawn and haunted look on his face as he feared what Michael was going to say next.</p><p>\"I saw a young-looking copper run into the clearing,\" Michael continued, not taking his eyes off my father. \"He raced to the edge of the well, and with his torch, he saw Molly lying at the bottom. He called out for help and he was joined by three other coppers. One of them was you,\" he said, pointing a finger at my father.</p><p>My father said nothing.</p> <p>\"The younger copper wanted to climb down into the well and help Molly, as he hoped that she might still be alive. But the others didn't want to help her. They said she was a thieving whore. To hear him speak about her in such a way, I had to do everything in my power to stay hidden. The younger cop said he hadn't signed up to break the law himself. So he clambered up onto the wall of the well as if getting ready himself to climb down and help Molly. It was then I saw you...\" Michael said, his voice turning suddenly angry as he jabbed his finger at my father again. \"I saw you run forward and push that young officer into the well. I couldn't believe what I had seen. I had to cover my mouth for fear of crying out and revealing myself. I couldn't comprehend what I had just witnessed. A police officer murder another police officer.\"</p><p>\"Why didn't you help him?\" I snapped at Michael, feeling sick and confused.</p><p>\"I was just twenty - a boy,\" Michael said, looking at me. \"I'm not trying to excuse the fact that I have remained silent for all these years, but they were police officers. I heard the three of them get their stories straight as if it was something that they were used to doing. How did I know that they wouldn't say that it was me who had pushed the officer into the well? How did I know they wouldn't give evidence to say I had killed Molly, too? I was just young and scared. So I ran, Sydney. I'm not proud of that. I ran and kept running. Two days later, I left Cliff View and hit the road. I was angry and confused and I hated myself. I started to drink, get into fights to try and release that hatred I had eating me alive from inside out. I began to believe that I had been cursed for my cowardice. Then one night, as I sat and got drunk in that bar, I watched as that guy kept harassing that young girl. In my drunken state, that young woman looked like Molly. I swear to God, Sydney, it was her. She looked at me from across the bar and whispered, 'Help me, Michael.' So I got up. I wouldn't fail her again. I raced across the bar and took hold of that guy. As I had my hand gripped about his throat, it was your father's face I could see as he had pushed that young copper into the well. So I pushed back, not just for Molly, but for that poor police officer, too. I pushed your father down that flight of stairs,\" Michael explained. With tears streaming from his eyes, he looked at my father and said, \"But it wasn't you, was it? It was some drunken punk who thought it would be fun to tease a girl in front of his mates. And when I looked back at the girl, she wasn't Molly. She was just some girl, who wouldn't even meet my stare, although I had come to help her.\"</p><p>I crossed the short gap by the well, and took Michael's cold, damp hands as thunder began to rumble in the distance. Michael looked at me and said, \"Every second I spent locked in my cell, I knew I was paying for being a coward that night - for not coming forward and telling the truth. And I know that the ten years I spent in prison would never make up for what I failed to do. I would never be free of that guilt. Tonight, it stops,\" Michael said, looking back at my father. \"Tonight the guilt - the curse - I've been living with since that night ends. I'm not scared of you and your friends anymore.\"</p><p>My father looked at me from beneath his cap, and coldly said, \"What is done is done. None of this will bring those people back. This will only destroy more lives, like the lives you destroyed out on the road, Sydney. If you tell on me, I tell on you.\" I could see a twisted looking smile form just beneath his moustache.</p><p>Turning on my father, and a rage burning so deep inside of me for him it was almost overwhelming, I hissed, \"I'm not so sure it was me who killed those people.\"</p> <p>\"Of course it was you,\" he smiled knowingly back at me. \"And Michael knows it, too. I know all about your sordid little affair. I know you were busy fucking the farmer's son that day instead of doing your duty. It's my business to know everything that goes on in this town. Michael knows you were drinking, too, don't you, Michael?\"</p><p>Michael stared back at him without making a reply.</p><p>\"Are you going to tell the truth about that, too, Michael?\" my father teased. \"Are you really going to sit back and watch Sydney go to prison for a very long time for killing five people - one of which was a five-year-old boy - because she was drunk thanks to you?\"</p><p>\"Someone else was out on that road,\" I shouted at my father over another boom of approaching thunder. \"I've been back to take a look. There are brake marks at the scene. I never even touched my brakes.\"</p><p>\"Is that it?\" my father scoffed. \"You killed them, Sydney. Even the old git called you a witch with his dying breath for killing him and his family.\"</p><p>Then, as if Jonathan Smith were standing right behind me, I heard him whisper, witch, on the wind. Gooseflesh ran up my back and I shuddered all over again.</p><p>\"He called you a witch!\" my father mocked me.</p><p>That word went over and over in my head, making me feel dizzy and sick. I could see Smith in the road again, the bubble of blood on his lips as he whispered, the word 'witch.'</p> <p>If I hadn't have been the one who had killed him and his family, perhaps he had been trying to say something else? What if he was trying to say...</p><p>Slowly, and with my stomach screwing up into knots, I looked at Michael. \"You said that Jonathan Smith spoke kinda funny, right?\"</p><p>\"Right,\" Michael nodded.</p><p>\"You said he spoke like that cartoon character, Elmer Fudd,\" I whispered, a blanket of dread covering me.</p><p>\"Sure,\" Michael said.</p><p>Turning to face my father, I said, \"I'm gonna go and catch me some wabbit.\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" my father grunted in anger.</p><p>\"Jonathan Smith couldn't pronounce the letter 'R', instead he used the letter 'W',\" I gasped, suddenly realising what it was Smith had been trying to tell me. \"He wasn't calling me a witch, he was saying the name Rich.\" I looked up at my father and said, \"Jonathan Smith was trying to tell me the name of the person who had really run him and his family off the road and killed them. He was saying the name Rich...he was trying to say Richard. He was saying your name, dad.\"</p><p>\"That's just ridic...\" my father started to say.</p><p>\"Oh, my God,\" I breathed, feeling as if I were going to drop to my knees again. I looked at my father, eyes wide, and said, \"It was you! It was you who drove them off the road and killed them.\"</p><p>\"You don't know what you're talk...\" he started to bluster again.</p><p>I closed my eyes and pictured that scene again, the blood on the dead bodies, my father arriving on scene. \"You had blood on your boots,\" I said, opening my eyes again. \"I remember seeing your feet through the window as you rushed towards my upturned patrol car. They had flecks of blood on them.\"</p><p>\"Of course they would, there was blood all over the goddamn place,\" he shouted at me.</p><p>\"But you came from the opposite direction. There wasn't any blood where you parked your...car,\" I said, trying to catch my breath. \"The police sign across the bonnet of the car. In my semi-consciousness, I thought that word ECILOP looked distorted and crinkled because I was looking at it through a smashed windscreen. It really was crumpled and distorted because the front of your patrol car was all smashed up. Why was it all smashed up, dad?\" I asked, looking at him.</p><p>My father made no reply. He looked very pale and very ill as the rain dripped from the peak of his police cap and down the front of his coat.</p><p>Desperate to try and keep my voice even and calm when all I wanted to do was scream, I whispered, \"It was you who drove them off the road. Maybe you didn't mean to kill them, but you wanted to scare them. Jonathan Smith was a pain in your arse, because even after ten years, he wouldn't give up trying to find out what really happened to his daughter that night. He wrote letters, didn't he? He knew there'd been a cover-up. So every year, he would come back with his family and make a nuisance of himself - ruffle your feathers. You were scared that one day he might just prick the conscience of whoever Molly had been secretly in love with. So you saw them out on the road that day, and decided to scare him away - run him out of town. I bet you put on your sirens and lights to scare the horse. But it went wrong and the horse dragged the cart and the Smiths out into the road and in front of your patrol car. It was you who killed them not me,\" I gasped, looking at him. And then everything hit me at once. \"You weren't calling me up on the radio that day because you were searching for me. You've already said you knew I was with Michael, but once you had caused that accident, you needed to get me away from the area; you couldn't risk me coming across it. You wanted it to look like some unexplained accident by whoever came across it later that day. When you heard me call up for urgent assistance, you knew I'd come across that accident - the accident you caused. That's how you knew where to find me so quickly. You called up Mac and Woody. That's why you used your mobile phone and not the radio. You knew they would come out and help cover things up. They weren't covering for me - they were covering for you.\"</p><p>With the realisation of my father's true deceit becoming clear before me, I leapt towards him and started to slap him and beat him with my fists. With tears streaming down my face, I screamed, \"How could you let me think I had killed that family? How could you have used me like that? Scare me that I was going to go to prison? You're meant to be my father. I'm your daughter - your little girl. All I ever wanted to do was make you feel proud of me,\" I sobbed. \"How could you let me carry that guilt around...\"</p><p>My father pushed me away. I fell backwards into the mud. \"You have nothing!\" he screamed at me, a flash of bright, white lightning appearing in the night sky over his shoulder. \"I have your signed statement, remember? The one you signed to say that you were the one who hit those people? Not me.\"</p><p>\"I have statements, too,\" I screamed back at him, clawing myself out of the mud and back to my feet. \"I've seen the statements you changed the night Molly died.\" Then remembering how Vincent had told me that two patrol cars were out of use because they had been damaged, I said, \"I know your patrol car is in the garage being fixed up from the damage caused by hitting that cart.\"</p><p>\"Who has these statements? Who told you this about my car?\" my father shouted.</p><p>\"Vincent!\" I shouted, as I scanned the shadows for any sign of him.</p><p>\"Vincent?\" my father roared. \"Who in the hell is Vincent?\"</p><p>\"The new recruit at the station,\" I barked back at my father, now too angry to feel fearful of him.</p><p>\"What new recruit?\" he snapped.</p><p>\"The one you relegated to the filing cupboard. The one you gave the push-bike to...because the others think he doesn't fit in.\"</p><p>And as I started to describe Vincent, my father screwed up his face as if eyeing me with suspicion. \"Is this some kind of joke, or have you really just lost your fucking mind?\"</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" I snapped back at him.</p><p>\"The only copper I can ever remember working in the filing room and riding about on a police push-bike was Constable Vincent Lee. And as we already know, he died at the bottom of that well ten years ago,\" my father said, looking confused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You can't be talking about the same Vincent,\" I said. \"He's been in my flat. I've seen him, touched him and...\" I wanted to say fallen in love with him, but something stopped me. I looked at my father and added, \"You found my missing iPod. You told Mac to bring it over, but Mac was too busy, so he gave it to...\"</p><p>\"I've never touched your iPod,\" my father barked at me, then smiled. \"I see, so what you're saying is all of your evidence against me is on the say-so of a dying man who sounded like Elmer Fudd, and a note left by a ghost. I can see the jury now. They'll laugh you out of court. It won't even get to court, you stupid girl.\"</p><p>\"Vincent isn't a ghost!\" I screamed back at him, feeling suddenly confused and panicked.</p><p>\"He's dead,\" my father smiled, as another bolt of lightning zigzagged across the night sky. \"He's rotting in Cliff View Cemetery.\"</p> <p>\"You're lying,\" I spat, my heart turning cold in my chest as I took the letter from the bottle.</p><p>... This is the dying declaration of Police Constable Lee 5013</p><p>I read the line over and over, and in my mind's eye, I saw those numbers 5013 glisten before me. I had seen those numbers before. They had been pinned to Vincent's epaulettes. With every part of me beginning to prickle with gooseflesh, I realised how everything Vincent had done had been leading me to this very moment - to discovering the truth about my father. The Police song, Message In A Bottle, which he had downloaded to my iPod, the bottle he had left for me on my coffee table, the file he had shown me with the statements and letter from Jonathan Smith, the scars on his back and head, probably caused as he crashed into the bottom of the well. In my heart, I heard him whisper as he held me close on the bed, 'I know what it's like to be scared and alone.'</p><p>With my heart aching, I dropped to my knees in the mud, his letter clenched in my fist. Vincent had been describing how he had felt as he lay dying in the bottom of the well. To think of him on his own, dying in a foot of water next to Molly Smith's broken body, made me feel as if my heart had been ripped from my chest.</p><p>\"Vincent!\" I screamed, throwing my head back, letting the rain fall upon my upturned face.</p> <p>I couldn't hear him anymore, just the sound of the rain, the wind, and thunder. I knew he had gone. He had come to do what he had needed to do.</p><p>Lowering my face and turning towards my father, I looked at him and whispered, \"I hate you!\"</p><p>\"You'll get over it,\" he grunted.</p><p>I leapt at my father again, my hands outstretched before me, just wanting to rake the flesh from his smug-looking face. \"Vincent was a better cop than you - he was a better man than you. That's why you murdered him.\"</p><p>\"Get off me!\" my father roared, throwing me from him. \"You've lost your fucking mind. No one is going to believe a word you say.\"</p><p>\"But they'll believe me,\" Michael said, suddenly stepping forward and smashing his fist straight into my father's face. There was a sickening crack as my father's nose spread in a bloody mess. He dropped onto his arse in the mud. \"It's over!\" Michael shouted beneath another flash of purple lightning.</p> <p>\"It's far from over,\" my father said, taking his hand from his nose and looking down at the blood.</p><p>\"It's over,\" Michael breathed.</p><p>As quick as the lightning flashed again overhead, my father shot his hand out at Michael. Clenched in his fist was his can of police-issue CS spray. A jet of thick, white fluid shot from the nozzle of the can, hitting Michael in the eyes. Throwing his hands to his face, Michael staggered backwards towards the well. I watched as my father leapt to his feet. He raced towards Michael and pushed him hard in the chest with the balls of his hands. Michael tumbled backwards, blind by the CS spray which was now making his eyes feel as if they were ablaze inside his skull. He hit the wall of the well and disappeared over the edge.</p><p>I leapt through the air at my father. Michael had managed to cling to the edge of the well with his fingers. My father had started to prise them free.</p><p>\"Leave him alone!\" I screamed as Michael hung over the deep well of blackness.</p><p>\"Fuck off!\" my father barked, lashing out at me with his arm.</p><p>I fell backwards into the wet mud. With the wind knocked from me, I gasped mouthfuls of air into my lungs as I struggled to my feet. I clawed at my father's legs as I tried to get up. Reaching out, I gripped the end of his baton, yanking it from his utility belt. I staggered to my feet, and locking out my arm, I racked the hard piece of steel. I brought the baton down on my father's legs over and over again. His knees buckled and he fell to the ground, crying out in pain and clutching his knees. Dropping the baton, I reached down into the well, taking hold of Michael's wrists. The rain had made his skin slippery, and I could feel him sliding from my grasp and down into the pitch black.</p><p>\"Help me,\" I begged Michael. \"Push yourself up.\"</p> <p>\"I can't,\" Michael cried out. \"I think I've broken my hip.\"</p><p>He screamed in agony as I pulled on his wrists. Michael looked up, his eyes puffed closed and red.</p><p>\"I can't do this on my own,\" I cried out, knowing I was going to lose him to the well just like I had Vincent.</p><p>The rope! I suddenly thought.</p><p>I glanced back over my shoulder in search of it, but all I could see was my father shuffling towards me with the baton raised above his head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Put it down,\" I heard someone shout.</p><p>I looked over my other shoulder to see Grayson step out of the shadows.

Slowly, my father lowered the baton.</p><p>\"I ain't gonna tell ya again,\" Grayson roared. \"Drop the baton.\"</p><p>Like a sullen child, my father flung the baton into the nearby trees.</p><p>Grayson then edged his way over to the well, where I clung to his son. Not once did he stop pointing the shotgun at my father. Jess stood barking and snarling in the rain. \"Take the gun,\" Grayson snapped at me. \"And keep it trained on your father. You can do that, can't you?\" He looked me straight in the eye.</p> <p>\"With pleasure,\" I said, taking the gun from him and training it on my father.</p><p>Grayson leant into the well, as Michael gripped the ledge with the last of the strength in his fingertips. With one mighty heave, Grayson dragged his son from the well. Michael wailed in pain again, as Grayson laid him on the ground. Once Michael was safe, Grayson took the gun from me and trained it back on my father.</p><p>Staring at me through the rain, Grayson snapped, \"Well, you're the police officer around here, ain't ya? Do something, girl.\"</p><p>Silently, I walked over towards my father. Our eyes met. \"I always wanted you to be proud of me, dad,\" I whispered. \"I really did want to be a good cop, just to make you proud. But I don't want you to be proud of me anymore. That's not what's important. I want to be proud of myself for once, and I can only do that if I do the right thing. Vincent told me that.\"</p><p>Slipping the handcuffs from my father's utility belt, I placed them securely on his wrists. I looked into his eyes and said, \"I'm arresting you for the murder of Vincent Lee, the deaths of Jonathan Smith and his family, and for perverting the course of justice. You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you don't mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.\" Then, fixing him with an icy stare, I added, \"Do you understand?\"</p><p>My father made no reply.</p> <p>While Grayson called an ambulance for Michael, I led my father silently down the hill to the patrol car he had driven to the farm. I placed him in the back and closed the door. I drove through the night to Police Headquarters. I feared taking my father back to Cliff View Police Station, as I knew Woody and Mac would be there, and I no longer knew who I could trust. My father sat in silence, his eyes locked on me via the rear-view mirror. The only sound during that uncomfortable drive was that of the windscreen wipers fighting against the falling rain.</p><p>At Headquarters, I escorted my father inside. I explained the facts to the Chief Inspector while my father looked on sullenly. His detention was authorised and the case was handed over to the Police Professional Standards department to investigate. In the pale light of dawn, I made my way home where I slept peacefully. Neither Jonathan nor Molly Smith paid my dreams a visit. They had gone.</p><p>The following day, I returned to Cliff View Police Station to discover that Mac and Woody had both been arrested. I went to the filing room. Placed on top of a cabinet was a stiff brown envelope. Across the front someone had scribbled: For the attention of Police Constable Sydney Hart. I recognised the writing at once. It was the same as that written on the note which floated in the bottle at the bottom of the well. I opened the envelope to find all of the missing paperwork which would help to prove my father's guilt. I placed this in the internal post, redirecting it to the Professional Standards Department at Force Headquarters. Before leaving the station, I went to my father's office. I knew what I was looking for. Fixed to the wall behind his desk, was a framed black-and-white photograph of him and the other officers he studied at police training school with. I searched the rows of young, expectant faces of those officers just about to start out on their new police careers. Tucked away in the back row, and looking as if he were peering over the shoulder of the officer in front of him, was Vincent. I took the picture from the wall, and placing it in my bag, I left the station.</p><p>I walked through the overcast morning towards the cemetery. I wanted to see Vincent's grave. I had to. I had to know it was real and that Vincent truly did die in the bottom of that well. I know my father thought I was mad, and so would everyone else if I ever told them about the short time Vincent and I had spent together. But I knew it was real, I knew Vincent had come to me, because the pain I felt in my heart was agony.</p><p>With the wind blowing about me, I stood and watched a wave of fallen leaves dance over Vincent's grave. When they had cleared, I read the writing that had been chiselled into his grey headstone.</p><p>Vincent Lee</p><p>Son, Friend and Police Officer</p><p>Who sadly fell on duty trying to save the life of another</p> <p>1983-2003</p><p>In Loving Memory</p><p>Wrapping my arms about me, I stood and let the wind cool the tears which ran down my face.</p><p>\"Oh, stop crying, Sydney Hart, and have a Jammie Dodger,\" I heard someone say in my ear. With my eyes closed, I stood and pretended that Vincent was with me again. I didn't want to open my eyes, as I knew that as soon as I did, the spell would break and Vincent would fade away. I wanted to stand in that spot all day with my eyes closed, imagining he was with me again.</p><p>\"No, seriously, have a Jammie Dodger,\" I heard him say again, followed by the sound of a biscuit wrapper crinkling before me.</p><p>With my heart racing in my chest, I slowly opened my eyes. I could see that red coloured biscuit wrapper and a hand. I looked right to see Vincent standing beside me, offering me one of his Jammie Dodgers.</p><p>\"Are you for freaking real?\" I snapped.</p><p>\"You tell me,\" he smiled.</p><p>\"What I mean is, you show up in my life, do all this weird X-Files shit on me by leaving messages in bottles, and then get me to fall in love with you, only for me to find out that you're dead already,\" I breathed in disbelief at his casual attitude. \"That is your grave right there, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, that's the one,\" he said, squinting down at the writing. \"It looks quite nice. Expensive one, by the looks of it. I didn't think they cared.\"</p><p>\"Who didn't?\" I said, shaking my head in bewilderment.</p><p>\"Your father and the others,\" he said thoughtfully. \"They all had a collection. That's what paid for it.\"</p><p>\"I don't know how you can stand there and be...\"</p><p>\"Be what?\" he asked, glancing sideways at me.</p><p>\"So happy about it all,\" I gasped. \"You're dead.\"</p><p>\"But I am happy,\" he shrugged just like he always did.</p><p>\"How can you be?\" I asked him, fighting the urge to just throw my arms around him.</p><p>\"Because I got to meet you, Sydney Hart,\" he smiled. \"I've watched you for years as you've grown up. I've watched from afar as your father bullied and belittled you, and I saw the mistakes you made because of that. As you got older, I just couldn't help but fall in love with you.\"</p><p>\"So you've been...what...watching me all these years?\" I asked.</p><p>\"Not you as such,\" he said sadly. \"Your father. I just couldn't pass over, not properly, until I knew justice had been done for what he did to me and Molly Smith. I'm fussy about things like that. Then there was that car crash, which your father was so happy for you to take the blame for. I watched you that night, consumed with grief and guilt for something you hadn't done. And that hurt to see, Sydney. So, I decided it was time...time to get justice.\"</p><p>\"So you came into my life,\" I said, looking at him. \"You left all those little pointers to lead me to the truth. Why didn't you just tell me? Wouldn't it have been easier?\"</p><p>\"Would you have believed me?\" Vincent asked. \"A complete stranger appears and tells you that your father was responsible for a murder ten years ago, that he was responsible for the deaths of the Smith family and not you. No, you wouldn't have believed me. You would have only believed it if you discovered the truth for yourself.\"</p><p>There was a pause, as my mind tried to rationalise everything I had discovered, not only about my father, but Vincent, too. After some time, I looked at Vincent and said, \"So what happens now?\"</p><p>\"Your father goes to prison,\" he smiled.</p><p>\"I didn't mean that,\" I said. \"What happens to us? You are dead, Vincent. I guess that is my curse. Perhaps Jonathan Smith did curse me after all.\"</p><p>\"A curse?\" Vincent frowned.</p><p>\"For the first time in my life, I've met a man, a good man who I've fallen in love with, and he's dead already,\" I said bitterly. Turning to face him, I brushed the tips of my fingers over that scar hidden just beneath his hairline. \"I'm the only one who can see you, touch you, and hold you, Vincent.\"</p><p>\"I don't need anyone else to see me or hold me,\" Vincent whispered. \"All I want is you.\"</p><p>\"But haven't you got to go...\" I said, fumbling for the right words and looking back at the grave.</p><p>\"Not just yet...not for a while at least,\" Vincent said.</p><p>\"So what do we do now?\" I asked him, wondering what the future could possibly hold for us.</p><p>\"Take your clothes off for starters,\" he said back.</p><p>\"Sorry?\" I half-smiled.</p><p>\"Oh, God...no...what I meant to say was...\" Vincent started to mumble, looking embarrassed. \"What I meant to say was...is that...your clothes look soaked through with rain...you'll catch...a cold...\"</p><p>\"Give me a break,\" I sighed. \"We both know what you meant to say.\" I took his hand in mine as we strolled away from his grave. \"It hasn't even been raining today,\" I added, looking up at the sky.</p><p>And although I was holding the hand of a ghost, Vincent's touch felt more real than anything I had ever felt before.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
