She coo\u2019d up at him, while gripping his finger and tugging at his heart.</p><p>\u201cNow that grandpa got your daddy and mommy married and gave grandpa you as an added bonus for Christmas last year, we have to start working on getting Uncle Alex a wife,\u201d he continued talking, while tickling her tummy.</p><p>\u201cI love you to pieces, Princess and I want a lot of cousins for you running around the house.\u201d He continued talking to her as if she understood each and every word he was saying.</p> <p>\u201cI sure didn\u2019t get any thanks from your mom and dad for their marriage but of course I\u2019m not looking for a bunch of praise. My boys finding good women and giving me many grandkids to spoil is thanks enough,\u201d he said. He smiled with pure joy while looking at Jasmine.</p><p>\u201cOf course, a little thank you wouldn\u2019t be so bad,\u201d he muttered quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019m going a bit off course here, aren\u2019t I? I\u2019ve found the perfect bride for your Uncle Alex and I have a feeling we\u2019ll see a cousin for you in a year or so.\u201d He chuckled as he pictured Alex and Jessica together.</p><p>Joseph had known Jessica since she was a newborn. He knew she and Alex would be perfect together. It was simply a matter of getting them in the same room so nature could take its course.</p><p>Joseph thought about Alex\u2019s playboy lifestyle. It was time that boy settled down and got married.</p> <p>Joseph loved his first granddaughter so much. His heart felt like it would burst when she was in his arms. He wanted that feeling with many, many more grandchildren.</p><p>\u201cJoseph, did I just hear you plotting with your granddaughter about meddling in our son\u2019s life?\u201d Katherine said from outside the room, catching him off guard. He could hear the clear disapproval in her tone and knew he\u2019d been caught.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all dear,\u201d Joseph said, as innocently as he could. \u201cJasmine and I were just discussing what a blessing she is in our lives,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Katherine shook her head at her husband as she reached down to take their granddaughter into her arms. \u201cJoseph, Jasmine is only three months old and isn\u2019t discussing anything with you. She\u2019s just happy to hear the sound of your voice, no matter what nonsense you\u2019re spouting.\u201d All sternness fell from her voice as she held the precious bundle close to her.</p><p>Katherine didn\u2019t approve of her husband interfering in their children\u2019s lives but she had to admit the end result of Lucas and Amy getting married and having precious little Jasmine was worth the troubles.</p><p>Joseph sighed at the sight of his beautiful wife holding their granddaughter. Life was certainly good. \u201cLucas will be back in a few minutes so help me get the baby changed,\u201d Katherine said as she walked from the room.</p> <p>Joseph stood and looked at the picture on his wall. \u201cAlex my boy, you are in for a surprise,\u201d Joseph whispered to the frame so his wife wouldn\u2019t overhear. He quietly chuckled to himself as he walked out of the door.</p><p>Chapter one</p><p>\u201cAlex, good to see you,\u201d Joseph said. He wrapped his arm around his son\u2019s shoulders while leading him into the den.</p><p>\u201cHi Dad, sorry I haven\u2019t made it home in a while. That contract in Spain took a lot longer than I thought. Of course, I\u2019m not complaining because those beaches are hot and the women are even hotter,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cNow son, there\u2019s more to life than going out all the time and picking up pretty ladies who don\u2019t have a lick of brains or an ounce of heart,\u201d Joseph admonished.</p><p>Alex gave a hearty laugh. He knew his father wanted him and his brothers all married. He was more than a little suspicious Joseph had something to do with Lucas\u2019s recent marriage. Lucas wasn\u2019t complaining though. His wife, Amy was a true gem and their precious daughter was about the cutest thing there ever was.</p><p>\u201cDad, you know I\u2019m far too young to tie the knot. I don\u2019t need some woman in my life telling me what to do. I like having a lot of ladies to wine and dine. You don\u2019t want to break the hearts of all the single ladies in Seattle, now do you,\u201d Alex asked with far too much confidence, in his father\u2019s opinion?</p><p>Joseph knew it would take a very strong woman to bring his middle child to his knees. Luckily, he figured, the right woman wasn\u2019t far away.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I get it, you like the single life but you should know you\u2019re breaking your mother\u2019s heart. She wants many grandkids running through these cold hallways but children never think of their poor parents. After all, parents only sacrifice everything to raise their kids and bandage their wounds and love them unconditionally. There wouldn\u2019t be any reason to want to give back to them, I guess,\u201d Joseph said with a dramatic sigh.</p><p>Alex smiled at his father\u2019s antics. He and his brothers were used to the whole guilt trip charade since Joseph had perfected it. \u201cYou know I appreciate everything you and mom do for me. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to let you guilt me into getting married. I\u2019m smarter than Lucas,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>Joseph chuckled to himself. The harder they fought, the more satisfying it was when they fell, he figured.</p><p>\u201cAll right then, enough of this marriage talk,\u201d Joseph conceded. \u201cWe have that fundraiser banquet this weekend and I need you to attend. Both of your brothers can\u2019t because of previous engagements and it would look really bad for the company if at least one of my sons didn\u2019t show up to our own fundraiser,\u201d Joseph said, while acting like a martyr.</p><p>Alex hated going to those things. The people were boring with a capital B and it was all about being seen. He wished they could just give the money away without having to go through all the motions of a fundraiser. But he also knew millions of dollars could be raised in one night because the rich liked to be seen giving their money away. It made them feel self-important, he supposed.</p><p>\u201cJust let me know when and where. You know I\u2019ll go.\u201d He sounded more like he was headed to the guillotine, instead of an evening with great food and dancing. On a positive note, he would most likely take a lady home for a steamy night of lovemaking. That was something to look forward too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s being held at the Fairmont Olympic Hotel on Friday night, starting at nine,\u201d Joseph told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least if I have to go out and act like I actually care about the newest and greatest fashions, I\u2019ll be in a great place,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>The Fairmont was spectacular inside and out. It was listed on the National Register of Historical Places and they\u2019d done a fantastic job of bringing in the new designs without taking away from the old history. Alex enjoyed doing business there and he knew the food was going to be top quality. His mouth started watering a bit at the thought of having some Cedar Plank Smoked Salmon, one of their specialties.</p><p>\u201cOh, and keep an eye out for Jessica Sanders. She\u2019s the daughter of my dear business associate John Sanders and she\u2019s going to be there alone, as her father\u2019s out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, what have I told you about matchmaking? I can choose my own dates,\u201d Alex said, losing some of his patience. He didn\u2019t want to be set up. Marriage was simply not in the cards for him and in no way did he want kids. He idolized his gorgeous niece but the family thing was for Lucas, not him. He was still young at thirty-two years old and he wasn\u2019t ready to trade in the Lamborghini for a mini-van. He shuddered at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be a matchmaker. I didn\u2019t ask you to take her to the fundraiser. I simply asked you to keep an eye on her and say hello; maybe ask her for a dance. She\u2019s not from around here and her father said she isn\u2019t used to huge events. She normally avoids them at all costs but this fundraiser is something very important to her. She\u2019s always wanted to spend an evening at the Fairmont. Here\u2019s a couple of pictures so you can recognize her,\u201d Joseph said while holding them out.</p><p>Alex reached for the photos, just for the sake of curiosity. He looked down and was surprised at how attractive she was. She wasn\u2019t the typical socialite he was used to. Her features seemed softer, more inviting. One of the pictures was her and her father. She had her head thrown back in laughter, while her eyes were rounded, causing a sparkle to shine through the still shot.</p><p>Alex may have to change his mind and at least meet the woman but he was sure she\u2019d turn out to be just as fake as the rest of them. A picture may be able to capture an unguarded moment but from his experience, all women had an agenda. He didn\u2019t see how she could be any different from the rest.</p><p>Jessica walked down the wide staircase, admiring the beautiful golden railing with its intricate design. She had a mixture of feelings running through her. She hated parties that masqueraded themselves as fundraisers. They were only an excuse for the rich to rub elbows and talk about who had the most money. On the other hand, she\u2019d always wanted to come to the Fairmont.</p><p>It was steeped in history and there were so many areas to explore. The room she\u2019d rented had a spectacular view of the gardens. It was decorated to look more like a guest room in a distinguished home.</p><p>She\u2019d walked into the suite to the smell of fresh cut flowers and the sight of a bowl overflowing with fruit. Alongside that had been a bottle of champagne chilling in a bucket of ice. The bed was beautifully made with a note from the staff, welcoming her and offering any assistance.</p><p>Jessica was used to the red carpet treatment, which wasn\u2019t always as great as people seemed to believe it was. When your father was a millionaire, you never knew who liked you for you or who liked you for what they could get out of your father. Every place she went people would do all they could to accommodate her but it was usually a double edged sword.</p><p>After her last tragic break-up she\u2019d decided to forgo relationships altogether. She was tired of her heart being broken. Her last boyfriend had seemed like the perfect man. Thinking about him was a painful experience but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop herself.</p><p>He\u2019d ridden into her life like a knight in shining armor and she\u2019d fallen for him hard and fast. When he spoke, he said all the right things. He also romanced her unlike any other man she\u2019d known. She\u2019d been relieved he was wealthy because she didn\u2019t think he was gaining anything by being with her. To her, the love seemed genuine. She couldn\u2019t have been more wrong.</p><p>He courted her because his company was going under from the millions he\u2019d gambled and lost. He figured if he snatched her up, he could go into business with her father and save himself. His plan would\u2019ve worked too, as she was blinded by his games. She would\u2019ve remained blind if she hadn\u2019t gotten home early from a trip to find him in bed with the maid.</p><p>When she walked into her bedroom and saw the two of them wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, on her bed, she quickly shut the door and walked out of the house. She thought he respected and loved her enough to wait to have sex until their wedding day. He never desired her in the first place and the waiting had turned out to be a blessing in disguise for him, as the \u2018maid\u2019 he\u2019d hired was really his long-time girlfriend.</p><p>Jessica snapped back to the present and walked into the ballroom. She wasn\u2019t easily impressed but tonight was an exception. Every detail of the room was exquisite. There were several chandeliers hanging at least three feet down and almost equally as wide. The crystals dripping from them were shooting off prisms of light in every direction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The linen covered tables held only the finest dinnerware and the candles were creating a soft glow from the centerpieces. The room had the added appeal of strategically placed tall shrubs, offering privacy if a couple chose to sneak behind one.</p><p>Jessica was feeling more positive about the evening ahead. It was a beautiful night and the organization she often donated to, the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), was going to receive a substantial amount of money. She\u2019d already decided to enjoy herself. Later she could return to her boring life.</p><p>She sat down at one of the tables and before she knew it, her dinner was finished and she found she was having a delightful time speaking with a few of the other guests. When an older gentleman asked her to dance she gladly accepted. They weren\u2019t on the dance floor for long when they were interrupted.</p><p>\u201cMay I cut in?\u201d</p> <p>Even though the words came out a question, Jessica had no doubt they were a command. The gentleman she was dancing with heard it as well and stepped aside without a word. Jessica didn\u2019t like men who were so overconfident that they felt they deserved anything they wanted. She wouldn\u2019t cause a scene though. Besides, the man was intriguing, so she allowed him to take her into his arms.</p><p>As she placed one of her hands in his and the other on his shoulder, she could feel the raw power of his hold. He had the most piercing beautiful blue eyes she\u2019d ever seen. They were the kind of eyes that could penetrate straight into your soul. She would have to be on her guard with him.</p><p>Suddenly it clicked who the man was; Alex Anderson. Their fathers did a lot of business together. This man with the entrancing eyes, kissable mouth and sexy body, was a playboy unlike any other.</p><p>He was known to be \u2018uncatchable\u2019, as the single ladies put it. He dated many women but made it clear he wouldn\u2019t settle down. His grin had graced hundreds of magazine covers, making women both young and old, lose a bit of sleep at night over erotic thoughts of him.</p><p>Her heart was racing as they played a game of cat and mouse. He kept attempting to pull her body intimately into his, while she was concentrating on keeping the proper amount of distance between them. If she wasn\u2019t on a self-imposed leave of men she could easily consider a night of flirting with him. She shook her head to clear it and decided to just get through the dance so she could move on as quickly as possible.</p> <p>His smoldering blue eyes flashed into hers, as his perfectly sculpted lips turned up into a sexy as sin smile. He knew he was hard to resist and he seemed to be treating her to his full arsenal of charms.</p><p>He slowly brought her fingers to his mouth and ran his lips across her knuckles. She felt a shudder ripple through her body. He then flicked his tongue across the same spot and desire pooled deep inside of her. \u201cI\u2019m Alex Anderson, and you\u2019re intriguing,\u201d he finally whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cJessica Sanders but I\u2019m assuming you already know that,\u201d she replied.</p><p>The hotel was everything she could\u2019ve ever imagined but it dimmed in comparison to the man holding her. While she was in his arms, the rest of the people and even the room itself seemed to disappear. She knew he was dangerous and she was playing a game with him she couldn\u2019t possibly win but for some reason she wasn\u2019t able to pull away.</p><p>The man was intoxicating. As he spun her around the barely lit dance floor, she was sinking further into his spell. She could feel the solid muscles beneath her fingertips and his scent was spell-binding. It was a combination of his masculinity, enhanced by expensive cologne.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had someone cut in on a dance since I was in high school. Don\u2019t you see that as a little overzealous?\u201d she asked, raising her brow. \u201cPerhaps I didn\u2019t wish to dance with you but didn\u2019t want to cause a scene,\u201d she added sweetly.</p> <p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Jessica raised her eyebrows at him questioningly and waited.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was at all presumptuous to cut in on the dance. You were barely keeping your eyes open; the boredom of your partner was so overwhelming. So you see, I should be thanked for saving you from the tediousness of a boring partner,\u201d Alex said with a grin, which left her speechless.</p><p>He spun her around the dance floor, undressing her with his eyes. She was shouting to herself to end the dance but she couldn\u2019t seem to pull away from him. He was too compelling. Besides, she thought to herself, they were in a room full of people. What could possibly happen? She decided to enjoy the flirtation.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so unbelievably stunning. We can leave this dance now and head up to my suite,\u201d he offered with the confidence of a man used to being told yes.</p><p>She laughed nervously before replying, \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hand from the center of her back, dangerously low, then back up again, causing a rush of heat to flash through the center of her body. He was challenging her to take a chance, from the brush of his hands, to the look in his eyes. She was surprised by how badly she wanted to take him up on the offer. If nothing else, she was enjoying the sexual play.</p><p>\u201cI think we should end this dance now,\u201d she stated a bit breathlessly. She didn\u2019t know how much more she could take before caving in to him.</p> <p>\u201cBut our song hasn\u2019t ended yet,\u201d he said as he pushed the small of her back, bringing her hips into contact with his obvious arousal. He then brought his head down to the exposed skin of her neck, running kisses, along with some gentle nips, across her pounding pulse.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t been holding her so closely, her knees would\u2019ve buckled, melting her into a pool at his feet. He moved his mouth over her ear and whispered, \u201cWhen you\u2019re lying beneath me, I\u2019ll have you trembling as my hands and mouth turn your body into liquid fire. You\u2019ll be calling out my name, begging me to finish this.\u201d</p><p>Jessica gasped, as his words made her tremble uncontrollably. She\u2019d never been seduced like this before, let alone in a crowded room. If they\u2019d been alone, she would\u2019ve let him take her right then and there, giving up on her vow of waiting until marriage. She tried to gather her wits about her.</p><p>\u201cHave you been told before how arrogant you are?\u201d she tried to make her voice stern but was bellied by the fact that it was choked with arousal.</p><p>\u201cNo, just how good I am,\u201d Alex answered, with that same arrogance.</p><p>The comment was able to bring her a little closer to reality. \u201cYou need to stop this. People are beginning to stare at us,\u201d she whispered self-consciously.</p><p>\u201cLet them stare. They\u2019re only wishing they could trade places with me,\u201d he said, while running his lips back up her neck and across her cheek, to the corner of her mouth, where he flicked his tongue out along her bottom lip.</p><p>She allowed herself to run her fingers through his hair, neck and finally shoulder, before she took a step back. \u201cThank you for the dance Mr. Anderson,\u201d she said politely, as if they hadn\u2019t almost been making love on the dance floor in front of a crowd.</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure was all mine Jessica and after what we just shared don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little formal to be calling me by my last name,\u201d he said with mockery.</p><p>\u201cMr. Anderson,\u201d she emphasized, \u201cthere are plenty of women here who would be more than willing to play a game or two with you tonight. I\u2019m not one of them.\u201d She turned and walked away, though it took all of her will-power not to glance back around to drink him in one last time.</p><p>Alex stood there, enjoying the sway of her hips as she walked away. Damn she was hot and he wouldn\u2019t mind a night with her. Her body had responded eagerly to his touches and he knew she was just as bothered as him. He wasn\u2019t done with Jessica Sanders; she just didn\u2019t realize yet when he decided he wanted something, he always got it. Her denial was like a red flag to a bull. By the end of the evening she would be in his bed. He needed a drink right then though, or the entire room would know how badly he wanted her.</p><p>Jessica ordered a martini and guzzled it down, trying desperately to calm her nerves. The man should have a danger sign attached to him. Her legs were still weak with arousal and her breathing still hadn\u2019t normalized. She was getting out of there as soon as it was politely acceptable.</p><p>She stepped out from the patio doors and was almost lifted up by the strong wind. It was blowing so hard it actually took her breath away. She stood there for a few minutes and watched as lightening slashed across the sky.</p><p>She loved adverse weather. Her family thought she was crazy because as everyone else was running for cover, she would grab a chair to watch the show. She delighted in the smells, sights, sounds and excitement of a great storm.</p><p>After a few minutes, the wind got even stronger and she decided she\u2019d better head in before she looked like she\u2019d taken a ride in a tornado. She stepped back through the doors, unaware Alex had watched both her exit and return.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t come in when she did, he would\u2019ve gone out after her. When she walked through the doors, he had eyes for her alone. She looked more gorgeous than ever before. Some of her hair had escaped the tight confines of her bun and her cheeks were flushed red. She looked as if she\u2019d just crawled out of his bed after a night of lovemaking.</p><p>He tried not to think about her or look for her but his gaze kept seeking her out. He rejected several women, who made it more than clear they\u2019d be willing to warm his bed that night. He only wanted one woman to do that and the rest of the women in the room paled in comparison to her.</p><p>Jessica made small talk with several people, only half listening, for the next couple of hours. Her head was starting to get fuzzy from the number of drinks she was consuming. She normally only had one or two at most. She didn\u2019t like to alter her reality but tonight was different and she needed some liquid courage to make it through the evening.</p><p>Alex seemed to find her no matter where she was and their eyes connected throughout the evening. She noticed many women trying to gain his attention but he brushed them off, one after the other. Finally with about a half hour to go, he took a woman out on the dance floor and then stayed with her. Jessica was surprised by the slight jealousy she felt as the other woman tossed her head back in laughter.</p><p>Jessica tried to tell herself it was a good thing. She wasn\u2019t into one night stands and Alex wasn\u2019t the type to enter into a long term commitment. She wasn\u2019t looking for that anyway. Someday she would settle down but it would be a battle to find someone who wanted her and not what her father could give him.</p><p>She finally had enough and decided to head for her room. She headed towards the elevators. It was time to sleep the night off and then get out of the hotel and as far from Alex Anderson as she possibly could.</p><p>The doors on the elevator were just about to shut. She picked up her pace and called, \u201cplease hold the doors.\u201d She was relieved to see a hand stop them from shutting.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said a bit breathlessly.</p><p>She slipped inside, looking towards the ground so she wouldn\u2019t trip on her long dress. When the doors closed, she finally looked up, noticing who the other occupant was.</p><p>She moved away from him quickly, into the furthest corner of the elevator. The ride would only last a moment and then she\u2019d be blessedly alone in her room. He kept his eyes on her, making her start to feel uncomfortably aware they were alone in a very small space. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared anywhere she could but at him, knowing that his eyes were still focused on her. She figured she must be a mess; she\u2019d consumed way too much alcohol and the wind had blown her hair loose with several strands refusing to cooperate, repeatedly falling across her face.</p><p>Just when she didn\u2019t think the silence could become any more awkward, there was a flickering of the lights, followed by darkness. There was nothing. No music coming through the speakers, no light whatsoever, not even from the buttons.</p><p>Jessica could feel her heart pounding so hard she was sure the noise of it hitting her ribs could be heard by Alex.</p><p>\u201cJessica, are you alright?\u201d he asked her. \u201cYou aren\u2019t claustrophobic, are you?\u201d</p> <p>She took a couple of deep breaths before she said, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of small places but I\u2019m not a huge fan of the dark.\u201d She was trying to stay brave but the seconds were ticking by and the pure blackness felt like it was closing in on her.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t panic. The lights would flash back on at any moment and the elevator would continue going up, getting her out of the blackout. She started counting in her head. She reached twenty when she felt Alex\u2019s hand on her arm.</p><p>She jumped at his touch. She was trying so hard not to be frightened but the darkness was all consuming.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be okay. This will all be over in a moment. Buildings have contingency plans for when this kind of thing happens,\u201d he tried to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why there isn\u2019t any noise at all,\u201d she said as her voice shook.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re most likely around the fourth floor so there wouldn\u2019t be any noise from the lobby,\u201d he reasoned. \u201cI wonder what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went out earlier in the evening and there was a pretty spectacular storm outside. A power line most likely got knocked over,\u201d she said. Talking to him was making a little of her fear subside and his touch on her arm let her know she wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to feel around for the phone and see if I can get someone on the line. They need to know we\u2019re in here and I can find out what\u2019s happening,\u201d he explained before releasing her arm. She had to fight herself so she wouldn\u2019t reach out and grab him.</p><p>She sunk to the floor and hugged her knees to her chest. She was grateful now she\u2019d had a few extra drinks because it was the only thing calming her nerves.</p><p>\u201cThe phone isn\u2019t picking up.\u201d Alex\u2019s voice startled her. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to wait this out but don\u2019t worry, elevators are extremely secure and it won\u2019t take them long to get us out.\u201d</p><p>His voice drew closer and then his foot kicked her in the ribs. She let out a whoosh of breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you okay?\u201d he dropped to his knees and began running his hands from her legs up to her side. Her lungs exploded in a gasp, as heat pooled in her core.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really, you barely touched me at all,\u201d she said huskily. He seemed to realize what he was doing because his hands stilled suddenly and then they were gone. She breathed another sigh, not sure if it was relief or disappointment.</p><p>Alex could hear the huskiness in her voice and it sent a kick right to his gut. He wanted her badly and now they were alone...in the dark...for who knew how long. If he didn\u2019t keep his distance he wouldn\u2019t be responsible for what happened next.</p><p>\u201cHow long do you think it\u2019ll take for them to get us out?\u201d she asked, trying to fill the silence.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t take long. Did you enjoy yourself this evening? I think half a million was raised by the time I left,\u201d he said, seeming to know she needed the comfort of words to fill the void.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak for several moments and he started to wonder if she was having a panic attack. He really hoped not. He didn\u2019t know how to deal with hysterical women.</p><p>\u201cYou know, we really are safe Jessica. These things don\u2019t just plunge through the shaft and explode on the bottom, like in the movies. That\u2019s just Hollywood\u2019s way of making things exciting,\u201d he said in an attempt to comfort her.</p><p>When she still didn\u2019t speak, he moved next to her again and let his leg rest against hers. Her body seemed to relax and he heard her breath escape in a sigh.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I just really don\u2019t like the dark,\u201d she finally said to him. \u201cWhat do you do in your free time?\u201d she asked, needing to hear the sound of his voice.</p> <p>\u201cI like to travel. I handle most of our international business, because my older brother has so much work to do here and Mark would choose to never fly if he could get away with it. I, on the other hand, am happy to be in a different country each month. My father usually has to drag me home,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>He was noticing lately though he was staying home more often. He\u2019d started to really miss his family. He was even finding himself enjoying the time spent on his brother\u2019s ranch, herding cattle.</p><p>Many things that had once excited him were starting to lose their appeal. He figured he was just getting older. Of course he was only thirty-two and shouldn\u2019t be thinking of himself as aging. \u201cWhat about you? What makes Jessica happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to travel a lot with my father but I grew bored of it. I\u2019m really more of a homebody now. I do a lot of volunteer work which keeps me plenty busy. I\u2019ve been taking some courses at the college, nothing major, just some fun art, cooking and photography classes. I have a Masters degree in Business because my father wanted me to go into the family corporation but I can\u2019t stand sitting behind a desk all day,\u201d she trailed off.</p><p>Alex was surprised she\u2019d gone so far in school. Most of the ladies he knew, with her amount of money at their disposal, didn\u2019t feel a need to go to school. They just lived on their parents\u2019 money and name until they snagged themselves a rich husband.</p><p>Jessica sat there, extremely aware of Alex\u2019s leg pressed up against hers. She was incredibly attracted to him but it didn\u2019t matter because men like him didn\u2019t give her the time of day except for a quick trip to bed. He was far too sexy and masculine for her. They always went after the ditzy blondes with huge breasts and no brains. The kind of woman like the bleach-blonde she\u2019d seen him dancing with earlier that evening. The kind of woman who they considered a trophy for their arms.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t reveal to him how her heart ached to be loved for herself and not her money. She wanted to be desired and to be the only thing on a man\u2019s mind. More silence engulfed them, making her hyper aware of his scent. It would be so easy to lean into him and find some comfort.</p><p>The elevator made a groaning sound and jerked slightly. Jessica let out a gasp and then she locked her arms around Alex, shaking in fear. She was going to die in the dark, tiny box.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay Jessica, the elevator\u2019s just settling a bit. I promise you it won\u2019t fall. There are several back-up safety features for all emergencies. Even if it did fall, which I guarantee you it won\u2019t, we\u2019d get a little bruised up in the worst case scenario. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d He pulled her onto his lap and wrapped his arms around her trembling body.</p><p>He kept speaking in a soothing whisper and stroked her from the small of her spine, up to her neck and back down again. She didn\u2019t know if it was his words or the touch of his hands but soon she wasn\u2019t so afraid.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry Alex. I\u2019ve just always had a fear of the dark. Believe it or not, I still have a small light on at my place. I know logically that nothing is going to come and get me from the dark but I think I watched far too many Stephen King movies as a child and they stuck with me,\u201d she said with a little self depreciating laugh.</p><p>They began talking about different topics, just passing the time. He didn\u2019t push her aside and she didn\u2019t offer to move from his lap. She knew she probably should but she felt so much comfort sitting there she couldn\u2019t will herself to move.</p><p>After more time passed the rubbing stopped comforting her and started making heat pool inside her stomach. His hands were traveling lower with each pass and more wide spread. She could feel him touching the sides of her breasts, stomach and hips. She started breathing heavier and could feel her body becoming more aroused.</p><p>She felt his hand run up her neck and grip the back of her head. He turned her and then his lips were finally pressed against hers. She would\u2019ve thought the heat from their lips colliding would\u2019ve been enough to sear the walls.</p><p>His tongue slipped inside her mouth and her body exploded with pleasure. She\u2019d never been kissed so hungrily. The passion in his kiss left no doubts he would be a fantastic lover. She knew she needed to stop them from continuing. She was trying to gain the will-power to pull away when his hand slid up under her skirt and skimmed her bare hip. The only thing between his hands and her heated core was a wisp of fabric, which she was surprised hadn\u2019t melted away from the burning of her body.</p><p>Without breaking the kiss he shifted her body so she was straddling his lap, allowing his hands more access to explore her. His hands roamed all over, making her arch into him. She could feel his desire pressing against her aching heat and she damned the clothes keeping them apart.</p><p>She gave into her own internal battle and let herself feel everything he was doing to her. He ran his tongue from her mouth to her neck, gently biting at her pounding pulse point. She wiggled against him while he slowly slid the thin strap of her dress down her shoulder, with his lips following its process.</p><p>She felt the cool air touch her aching nipples only seconds before his mouth was lavishing the hardened peaks. She threw her head back and groaned as rolling waves of sensation washed through her. He thoroughly loved her tender breasts before his mouth licked and kissed its way back up her neck and then fastened onto her lips once more.</p><p>While he continued kissing her she felt him shifting their clothing around. Finally, there was nothing between them and he was enclosed within her in one swift thrust. She gasped out loud at the unbelievable pleasure of their joined bodies. He gripped her hips, leading her up and down on his large erection. She quickly took over and started moving, encouraged by his quickly accelerated breathing. He held her head with one hand, pulling her closer, sealing their mouths, mimicking the movements of their bodies with his tongue. He brought his other hand to her swollen womanhood and flicked it, sending her over the edge in an explosion of pleasure.</p><p>She began shaking around him, gripping him even tighter into her pulsating body. He grabbed her lower back and thrust up into her one final time, letting out a groan of pleasure as he spilled his seed deep inside of her.</p><p>Jessica collapsed against him as they both tried to regain their breath. They were still connected together. She was so satisfied she wanted nothing more than to lay her head against his chest and fall asleep in his arms.</p><p>There was another jerk of the elevator and then the lights flickered. She jumped off him in a panic, quickly straightening out her clothing. Luckily, he\u2019d only taken the time to move her clothes instead of removing them. She backed away until she felt the wall behind her. She prayed he was putting his clothes back into place too.</p><p>Suddenly the lights turned back on and stayed on. Jessica was happy to see him standing there, fully clothed. He had a look of guilt and regret on his face. The elevator started to move downward. It must be standard procedure to return to the lobby after a power failure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLook, Jessica...\u201d he began when the door whisked open. She didn\u2019t want to hear him make excuses about how sorry he was and how he wouldn\u2019t be calling her. She couldn\u2019t take that kind of rejection. What had been amazing and wonderful for her had most likely been a disappointment for him. She couldn\u2019t listen to him try and downplay what had happened.</p><p>Jessica jumped out of the elevator into the crowd milling around the lobby and quickly was lost from Alex\u2019s sight. He thought about chasing her down but decided to let her go. He\u2019d never felt more excitement in the arms of a woman. It had been passionate and thrilling and he wanted to do it all over again.</p><p>It was obvious she already regretted what had taken place so it was better to try and forget all about the incident and move on. He quickly cut through the crowd and headed up to his room where he fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>The next morning Alex grabbed his things and checked out, thinking his time in the elevator with Jessica wouldn\u2019t be something he\u2019d forget about anytime soon. He knew that she\u2019d been scared and if he tried to chase her she\u2019d run away even faster.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>One Year Later</p><p>Joseph was meeting his good friend John for lunch. It\u2019d been far too long since they\u2019d gotten together. \u201cJoseph, so good to see you,\u201d John said as he grasped his friends hand.</p><p>\u201cGreat to see you too. Tell me how things have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is great. I have a new grandson who\u2019s the light of my world. Here, I brought some pictures. Look how handsome he is,\u201d the proud grandfather said as he handed over several photos.</p> <p>\u201cCongratulations, he\u2019s a mighty fine looking boy. Did Jessica get married?\u201d Joseph asked, knowing he hadn\u2019t heard of any nuptials but it could\u2019ve been done privately. Joseph was still upset that she and Alex hadn\u2019t ended up together. He\u2019d been so sure they were a perfect match.</p><p>\u201cNo, she won\u2019t discuss the father. I\u2019ve tried on several occasions to ask her about it and she closes right up. She said it was a one-time thing. The father didn\u2019t know and she was keeping it that way. I tried to bribe her, threaten her and beg her, all to no avail. She\u2019s being tight lipped about the whole incident,\u201d John said with frustration.</p><p>\u201cWas she seeing anyone around the time of her pregnancy that you could possibly question?\u201d Joseph asked with sympathy towards his friend. He knew that if one of his sons got a lady pregnant he\u2019d expect them to do the right thing. Hell, he hoped he\u2019d raised them well enough that they\u2019d do the right thing because it was what you did, not because it was expected from you.</p><p>\u201cShe hasn\u2019t been in a relationship for a few years that I know of. She\u2019s been hurt pretty badly. Her last serious relationship ended when she found the guy with another woman. She found out he\u2019d been like many others before him and only after money,\u201d he said with pain. John loved his daughter and it killed him to see her hurting.</p><p>\u201cHow old is the baby? Maybe somehow I can help you figure this out,\u201d Joseph offered, although he didn\u2019t have a lot of confidence in the plan.</p><p>\u201cJacob is three months and father or no father, he\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m so grateful he\u2019s been given to us. Jessica adores him. She loves being a mother and it\u2019s lifted her out of the depression she was in for so long,\u201d John said, instantly brightening up.</p> <p>\u201cShe was in a depression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all started after that big fundraiser dinner last year at the Fairmont. She came home for a while and was so sad. I was actually a little relieved when she announced her pregnancy because she started taking better care of herself,\u201d John said with a sigh.</p><p>Joseph sat up, on instant alert. \u201cCan I see those pictures again John?\u201d</p><p>John was more than willing to share the pictures as many times as they were requested. This time when Joseph examined the photos before him he looked closely at the features. There was a real possibility that he was Alex\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cJohn, has she given you any clues about the father?\u201d</p><p>John was picking up on Joseph\u2019s changed demeanor. \u201cDo you think it could be one of your boys?\u201d he asked with hope. John knew if it was either Alex or Mark, they\u2019d step up and do the honorable thing.</p><p>\u201cI think there\u2019s a chance that he could be Alex\u2019s. He was at that fundraiser and I\u2019d asked him to look after Jessica since she was there alone. After the event, he came home and wasn\u2019t himself not even going out. Then after a couple of months he went completely the opposite way and it seemed like he couldn\u2019t get far enough away, like he was trying to outrun some demons or something,\u201d Joseph finished softly.</p><p>\u201cThe only time she ever let something slip was to say that it was only one night and the guy hadn\u2019t mistreated her in any way. She told me she\u2019d made a mistake and wouldn\u2019t make him sacrifice his life due to her indiscretion. I told her the father at least had the right to know and he certainly should own up to his responsibilities but she closed down after that and wouldn\u2019t make any more comments on the subject.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think we can get the answer of whether it\u2019s Alex\u2019s or not if I can see her and the child. I think we\u2019ll be able to tell, from her reaction alone,\u201d Joseph said with excitement. The possibility of having another grandchild was exhilarating.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming over to dinner tonight. Why don\u2019t you and Katherine join us?\u201d John spoke with eager excitement.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a plan. John, if Alex is the father please don\u2019t say anything tonight. Let me tell my son. I know he\u2019ll do the right thing and I don\u2019t want Jessica to think you or I forced him into it,\u201d Joseph asked of his longtime friend.</p><p>\u201cI can respect that and honor your wishes. I have no doubts Alex will take responsibility for any child of his,\u201d John said with sincerity. \u201cJoseph, I\u2019m really sorry if he\u2019s the father and she didn\u2019t say anything. I\u2019m sure she believed she was doing the right thing,\u201d John finished sadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Jessica since she was a little girl John and I know that she would\u2019ve had valid reasons for keeping this to herself. She most likely thought she was doing Alex a favor, since he hasn\u2019t exactly portrayed himself as the stay-at-home with babies\u2019 kind of guy,\u201d Joseph admitted. \u201cBut I know if he\u2019s a father, he\u2019ll make a good one. I have to admit I\u2019m really hoping the baby is his son because that means I have my first grandson,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>They finished their lunch and went their separate ways, both anticipating the evening ahead. They\u2019d receive answers to questions too long unanswered.</p><p>Joseph made sure to arrive before Jessica. When she walked into the dining room and saw Katherine and him sitting there, her face gave her away. She only took about two seconds to compose her features again and then greet his wife and him but in that unguarded moment, John and Joseph both had their answer.</p><p>Joseph and Katherine both admired the baby, taking turns holding him. Katherine didn\u2019t know what was going on but she was drawn to the boy. She was reluctant to release Jacob at the end of the evening.</p><p>Jessica had a few tears in her eyes as she collected her son and left the house. She\u2019d made a joke about post pardon blues. Joseph figured she was feeling some guilt about keeping the baby away. He knew if they all stood back and waited she\u2019d come around on her own. She was simply too kind a person to keep her child away from grandparents that would love him.</p><p>Neither Joseph nor John were patient though and they weren\u2019t going to wait for her to come around. Alex was going to find out he was a father as soon as Joseph summoned him home.</p><p>Joseph had been hopeful last year Alex and Jessica would have an instant connection. He\u2019d been disappointed when his son came home and didn\u2019t say one word about her.</p><p>He\u2019d then gotten his hopes up once more as he\u2019d watched his son moping about and not in a hurry to travel off to faraway places. But after a month Alex started disappearing again and seemed to return to normal.</p><p>After lunch with John, Joseph knew why his son had been so down and out. Alex still had that void look about him but that was about to change. Alex walked in the door, not looking pleased that Joseph had asked him to rush home.</p><p>\u201cYou better sit down Alex. I have some news that\u2019s about to change your life,\u201d Joseph informed him. He wanted to get right to the point and didn\u2019t try to ease into things by making small talk.</p><p>\u201cJust spit it out dad. I had a twenty-hour flight and didn\u2019t get any sleep. I want a hot meal and to fall face first into bed,\u201d Alex spoke wearily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a father,\u201d Joseph stated without adding anything else.</p><p>Alex stared at his dad, waiting for the punch line. They stayed there; eyes locked together, neither speaking for a full minute.</p><p>\u201cDo you care to elaborate?\u201d Alex finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI met your child a couple days ago. You have a three month old son,\u201d was the only elaboration he gave.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible...\u201d he began, when he suddenly stopped. Joseph could see the wheels turning in his head.</p><p>Alex started thinking back to his night in the elevator with Jessica. He\u2019d only had unprotected sex one time in his life. He began doing math in his head and the time-line fit.</p><p>Alex\u2019s legs could no longer support him. He sank into the chair that was mercifully behind him. \u201cWhy...why wouldn\u2019t she tell me?\u201d he managed to squeeze out of his constricted throat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the why or how\u2019s. All I know is I met your son and I knew. Would you like to see a picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Joseph passed the pictures John had given him, without saying another word. Alex stared down at them and when he finally looked back up there were tears in his eyes. \u201cHe really is mine. I\u2019m a father.\u201d He placed his head in his hands and let it all sink in.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Alex long to go from shock to anger. How dare Jessica keep his son from him? He hadn\u2019t mistreated her in any way and she had no right to keep something this big from him. She would explain herself and he wouldn\u2019t miss out on any more of his son\u2019s life. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d be holding him in just a few minutes. The miles stretched on, as he weaved through traffic on the way to her apartment.</p><p>She was living in a secure complex. It didn\u2019t take him long to get clearance to head up to her door though. When you were as well known as his family, you knew just about everyone. He took a few deep breaths to calm himself. He then knocked on her door and waited as the seconds ticked by, seeming more like hours. Finally she was standing in front of him, her eyes wide with shock and fear.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my son?\u201d Alex had already missed out on too much time and he wasn\u2019t going to mince words.</p><p>There was no hello, it\u2019s been so long. How are you? He wasn\u2019t beating around the bush. He was tired and angry. He couldn\u2019t believe she would dare to keep his child from him. Sure, he hadn\u2019t bothered to call her but he had reasons for that.</p><p>She\u2019d affected him unlike any other woman before her and he hadn\u2019t trusted himself around her. Even with anger coursing through him she was the most beautiful sight he\u2019d ever witnessed. Her hair was longer and thrown into a messy bun with several pieces cascading down her face and neck. She didn\u2019t have a single trace of make-up on and there were smudges under her eyes from lack of sleep. She also had a glow about her that was beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessica was petrified. How had he found out? She\u2019d been terrified the other night when she saw Joseph and Katherine but they hadn\u2019t seemed to know the baby was their grandson. She couldn\u2019t figure out how Alex knew.</p><p>He looked more incredible than ever. He seemed tired and his dark hair was mussed. It looked as if he\u2019d run his hands through it a dozen times. His face had a sexy five o\u2019 clock shadow, making him seem more touchable. His scent was invading her and she realized she\u2019d missed him far more than she should. She thought about him often. Of course, how could she now when she looked at her son daily? He looked so much like his father, especially in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cAlex, what are you doing here?\u201d she finally asked, trying to sound neutral.</p><p>He chose to ignore her question and repeated his, \u201cI asked you, where is my son?\u201d He wasn\u2019t known for having a great deal of patience. He wasn\u2019t going to stand in the doorway and miss another moment of his son\u2019s life.</p> <p>Before she was able to say anything more he heard a cry from inside the apartment. His eyes rounded with wonder at the first sound he heard from his son. He was done standing in the doorway. He grabbed Jessica by the waist and physically removed her from his path.</p><p>Jessica let out a shocked gasp and then chased after him as he followed the sound of his son\u2019s cry. \u201cAlex, I did have a son but he isn\u2019t yours,\u201d she tried to lie. He\u2019d reached the swing his son was in by that moment, staring in fascination at the tiny human.</p><p>The baby was wide awake and staring at his father, momentarily distracted from his angry howls at being left alone. At her words Alex whipped his head around to glare at her. She took a step backwards at the violence in his expression.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me for one more second. You\u2019ve already stolen three months of my son\u2019s life from me. You won\u2019t deceive me anymore,\u201d he spat.</p><p>She knew to try and deny it again would only unleash more of his anger so she sank to the couch as her knees would no longer hold her up. She said nothing else, just watched as he stared at his son. The baby finally got tired of the staring game and let out a cry of displeasure. He wanted to be picked up.</p> <p>Jessica started to rise but Alex was already taking care of it. \u201cHey little guy, you want your daddy to pick you up?\u201d he lovingly spoke to his son. The adoration in Alex\u2019s voice brought tears to her eyes. He unlatched the safety belt and gently pulled Jacob from the seat.</p><p>Alex cuddled Jacob close to his chest, staring into his face. He was amazed at the love flowing through him. How could something so small fully claim his soul in the space of a single heart beat? He had no doubts that this was his boy. He looked like an Anderson. Jessica had a lot to answer for.</p><p>He sat down on the other end of the couch and softly spoke to his son. The baby looked up at him and cooed for a while, before his face scrunched up and he let out another full-fledged roar of displeasure. Alex turned to Jessica with a worried look on his face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s hungry. Give him to me and I\u2019ll take care of his dinner,\u201d she said, reaching her arms out. She could feel the milk dropping in her breasts and she needed to feed him as much as he wanted food. She was going to embarrass herself at any moment by leaking through her thin shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feed him. Just grab me a bottle,\u201d Alex said, not wanting to release his son.</p><p>Jessica looked uncomfortable and then Alex noticed the wetness on her shirt. His groin tightened as the thin fabric wasn\u2019t hiding anything from his view. Her wet nipples were clearly showing through. He didn\u2019t say another word. He handed the baby over to her, then got up and walked out of the room giving her privacy.</p> <p>Jessica was relieved when he left. She quickly quieted the baby and it brought a smile to her face. Her son took no time latching on and he always let out a little growl that seemed to say, finally mom, I was so hungry. Jacob was so much like his father. He had little patience when he wanted something.</p><p>She enjoyed these moments, brushing her precious son\u2019s head while he filled up. He closed his eyes in concentration and made little gulping noises. She leaned her head back against the couch and sighed. She tried to convince herself she\u2019d imagined that look of instant lust in Alex\u2019s eyes but she\u2019d felt the same sensation.</p><p>Even in his anger towards her, which she knew he was feeling, he\u2019d still felt desire and that reminded her how lonely she\u2019d been herself. As much as she loved her son, it would\u2019ve been nice to have someone to share those precious moments. She shook herself out of those kind of thoughts and focused on Jacob.</p><p>Alex wandered into his son\u2019s nursery. She\u2019d done a beautiful job of decorating it. There were hand painted stencils on the walls of various teddy bears in all kinds of pastel colors. He walked over to the crib and ran his hand along the quilt his son slept under every night. He looked at the wall and the breath rushed out of his lungs.</p><p>There on the wall, visible to his son was a frame with several pictures of him in it. He knew the baby was too young to recognize people but it filled his heart with joy that she\u2019d thought to let his son know who he was. Some of his anger slipped away.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stand to stay away any longer. He quietly walked out of the nursery. He stepped into the living room in time to hear Jacob let out a loud burp, which Jessica praised. Then she cradled him back into her arms and he watched as he latched onto her breast.</p><p>Alex felt like an intruder, spying on the intimate moment between mother and son but he couldn\u2019t turn away. It was obvious they had a strong bond together. He was feeling a bit jealous he couldn\u2019t be a part of the ritual. He would love to be able to cradle her in his arms while she cradled their son.</p><p>Once the baby latched on she leaned her head against the couch and closed her eyes. He finally walked into the room and sat next to them. She jerked her head up and stared at him. Jacob, seeming to feel her tension, let out a small protest.</p> <p>She forced herself to relax, which wasn\u2019t easy, considering Alex was there, next to her, with her body exposed. \u201cCan you please hand me that blanket?\u201d she asked, trying not to sound as nervous as she felt.</p><p>He handed it to her and she covered herself up. He was disappointed to lose sight of his son but relieved to have her cover herself. She\u2019d grown curvier since he\u2019d been with her. He smiled inwardly, thinking there was a positive to pregnancy. He was surprised he could think such a thought with what she\u2019d put him through.</p><p>Jacob apparently had enough. She started fumbling underneath the blanket, then she switched him to her shoulder and started patting him on the back. After a few minutes he let out another burp and then started cooing at his mother.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my big boy. Good job,\u201d she praised Jacob. He rewarded her by talking more gibberish.</p><p>\u201cCan I hold him again?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>Jessica reluctantly handed her son over. She wasn\u2019t used to having anyone interrupt their normal routine. She was having a difficult time watching father and son together. It made her somehow feel like she wasn\u2019t needed in the perfect picture they made.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you place pictures of me by the crib?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted him to know his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could\u2019ve known his father in person had you just told me I was going to be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, we both know you\u2019re not the type of man to settle down. I wasn\u2019t going to trap you into instant fatherhood because we had a one night stand in a dark elevator. I would\u2019ve eventually told you about Jacob but I didn\u2019t feel it was the right time.\u201d She still stood by her decision.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll marry in three days. My father\u2019s making all the arrangements. I spoke to your father on the way over here and he agrees with me. I won\u2019t miss out on my son\u2019s life.\u201d He spoke the words matter-of-factly. He said them as if the deal was done and she had no say in it.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t marry you Alex. My son won\u2019t be raised in a home with parents trapped into getting married. I\u2019ve seen far too many lives destroyed by making decisions like that. If you really want to be part of Jacob\u2019s life then we\u2019ll set up visitation arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Alex simply smiled at her. He\u2019d made a decision and as far he was concerned there was no need to discuss the matter.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to have our son labeled a bastard?\u201d</p><p>She was seething with rage. \u201cHow dare you?\u201d she spat at him. \u201cYou won\u2019t try and use my son to get what you want,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cJessica, we will marry. My son will have my name. I have the full support of both of our families. We would both lose all of their respect if we did anything other than marry. I want my son in my life full-time. I don\u2019t want to be a weekend father. You owe me for keeping him from me and your parents fully agree that we should wed right away. You\u2019re dishonoring both of our families by not doing the right thing,\u201d he finished. His voice was far more frightening to her because he wasn\u2019t getting angry or threatening. He was talking as if he was simply stating facts.</p><p>Jessica sat their seething for a few moments, glaring at him. She finally got up and left the room. She walked into her office to make a phone call to her father.</p><p>John answered on the second ring, \u201chello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, what did you and Alex talk about?\u201d she asked, not even bothering with any pleasantries.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d he asked, ignoring her question completely.</p><p>\u201cDad, I asked you a question,\u201d she said, in no mood to play games.</p><p>\u201cWe talked about your upcoming nuptials. When he found out he was a father he told me he wanted to do the right thing. He wanted to marry you and be a full-time father to his son. I support him Jessica. I know you had your reasons for not telling him but you don\u2019t keep a father away from his child. You did him wrong by not telling him,\u201d he said to her, with disapproval in his voice.</p><p>Jessica hung her head, not liking to disappoint her father but not ready to give up the fight. \u201cDad, I had my reasons. I won\u2019t get married because everyone\u2019s telling me what I should do,\u201d she said, begging him to understand.</p><p>\u201cJessica, Alex wants to marry you and do the right thing for your child. He\u2019s a good man. Are you willing to bring shame on Joseph by having people think his son would get you pregnant and then walk away?\u201d he asked, knowing by her silence she was conceding defeat. She loved her family and had a lot of respect for Joseph and Katherine. She would never want to bring shame on their family.</p><p>They talked for a few more minutes and then Jessica hung up the phone slowly, feeling as if her world had been upended. She took her time walking back out to the living room. When she entered she felt a tear slip down her face when she saw Alex sleeping on the couch with Jacob held securely in his arms.</p><p>She picked the baby up, which jerked Alex awake. \u201cI\u2019ve got him...\u201d he started to say.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ready for bed,\u201d she quietly stated, then turned and walked toward the nursery. She felt Alex right behind her as she gently tucked her son underneath his blanket. She said nothing else as she walked to the kitchen with him following closely behind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She prepared two cups of coffee and then sat down at the table. They both sat silently for a few moments, sipping from the steaming mugs.</p><p>\u201cJessica, we didn\u2019t get off to a great start but I hope by now you understand what needs to be done,\u201d Alex said in what he hopped was his most reasonable tone.</p><p>She held her head high and he knew he\u2019d won the battle. She had defiance in her eyes, with a hint of defeat. He was overwhelmed with gratitude. He didn\u2019t want to be away from his son for any length of time.</p><p>\u201cOkay Alex, it looks like you\u2019ve won this round. I\u2019ll go ahead with this farce of a marriage but I\u2019m telling you it\u2019s not a real one. I\u2019ll let you protect your family name and when the time is appropriate I\u2019ll file for divorce,\u201d she said with a strength that impressed him.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be no divorce,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe\u2019ll make it work out because I don\u2019t want to be away from my son. I never planned on marrying anyway so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m missing out on something else by being with you,\u201d he added.</p><p>His words made her wince. He was basically telling her he could stand to be married to her because marriage meant nothing to him. She didn\u2019t feel the same way. She\u2019d always wanted to get married but had given up because all the men she\u2019d dated had been willing to marry her only to access her money.</p><p>She knew Alex in no way needed her money. However, he still needed her for something other than herself. She guessed she was bound to end up in a loveless union. It would tear her apart but as a mother sacrifices were expected of you.</p><p>There was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do for her son. Her only regret was their union wouldn\u2019t be real and she wouldn\u2019t be giving Jacob any siblings. She\u2019d been an only child and had always wanted to have many kids when she was in her own relationship. She loved her son so much and the thought of never having that feeling of carrying a child inside of her again, of looking at her newborn for the first time, was almost enough to bring her to her knees with the pain coursing through body.</p><p>\u201cAlex, I\u2019m exhausted. Can you come back tomorrow and we will figure out all the details. Jacob is still waking up a couple of times each night and I wasn\u2019t able to take a nap this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep in the spare room. I want to be here when Jacob wakes up,\u201d he said, once again with that voice of authority.</p><p>Jessica was far too tired to argue with him any further. The thought of him sleeping only one wall away from her, was enough to cause her stomach to tighten. She figured she would need to get used to it as they would reside in the same house soon. She knew he wouldn\u2019t go for her staying where she was now. The entire reason he wanted them married was so he could be with his son and protect his family name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bed,\u201d was all she said, as she left the table.</p><p>Alex stayed where he was for several minutes after she left. He was barely able to stay awake himself but the thought of her in bed just down the hall was playing havoc with his senses. Their one time together had been in a dark elevator and over far too quickly. He would be able to bring them both so much more pleasure in a comfortable bed.</p><p>His groin strained against the zipper of his jeans. He groaned aloud and then headed towards her bathroom for a cold shower. He wouldn\u2019t be taking them nightly. Once they were married, they wouldn\u2019t be sleeping in separate rooms. That was the only thought keeping him from entering her room.</p><p>Alex was awakened by the whimpering sound of his son. He looked at the clock, noticing it was three in the morning. He was instantly alert. He walked into Jacob\u2019s room and gazed down at him in the crib. He was so tiny and fragile. Jacob started kicking his legs in excitement as soon as he spotted Alex, which filled him with warmth.</p> <p>Alex picked him up, feeling he had a full diaper. He was grateful for the days he\u2019d babysat his beautiful niece. He\u2019d learned how to change her so he knew what to do with his son. \u201cYou ready to get out of that yucky diaper?\u201d he cooed to his son.</p><p>Jacob answered him with a giggle and kicked his legs some more. Alex changed him, then moved to the rocking chair and cuddled him for a while. Jacob\u2019s temperament changed after about ten minutes though and he looked as if he was going to start throwing a fit again. Even after only a day with him, Alex knew his son wanted to be fed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go wake your mom. I certainly can\u2019t feed you,\u201d Alex said to Jacob with a little chuckle. He stepped into her room with the light softly shining in from the hallway. His breath was taken away by her unguarded, peaceful expression. In sleep she seemed so young and innocent. She didn\u2019t look like she could possibly be old enough to be a mother.</p><p>Jacob started wiggling in his arms, reminding him that it was time to eat. That snapped Alex out of his trance. He walked over to the bed and sat down. The movement woke Jessica and she sat upright. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked in a panic, getting ready to jump up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Alex said, while placing a hand on her shoulder in reassurance. \u201cJacob woke up and he\u2019s hungry. I already changed him, so if you feed him, then I will burp him and put him back to bed,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Jessica was still disoriented but held her arms out for her child. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to stay. We do this every night,\u201d she pled. She really didn\u2019t want him there with her body exposed. In the middle of the night it would be so much harder to not throw herself at Alex. She didn\u2019t need to show him how much he still affected her.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with him. If you got some of that bottle stuff then I could take over the night feedings,\u201d he said hopefully. Jessica had to smile a bit at his lack of knowledge over the name, formula.</p><p>\u201cNo, I like our nighttimes,\u201d she said simply. She figured it was dark enough she could feed her baby without having to cover him up. She liked to watch his precious face as he ate. She could gently caress his head and sooth him. He liked it too and would fall asleep quickly after he burped. When Jacob made a little growling noise followed by gulping sounds, Alex let out a quiet laugh, making Jacob jump. Surprisingly he stayed latched on and slurped away.</p> <p>\u201cMy son likes his food,\u201d Alex stated proudly.</p><p>Jessica smiled at Alex for the first time in the dim room. Her face had lost the guarded expression. He couldn\u2019t help himself; he needed to have physical contact with both her and his son. He scooted a little closer on the bed so his shoulder was pressing against hers, then reached his hand up and brushed the soft strands of hair on his son\u2019s head.</p><p>Their eyes were still locked together and he couldn\u2019t resist reaching towards her. He gently touched his lips to hers. Her taste was exquisite and pleasure shot all through his overheated body. He wanted her so badly. He most likely would\u2019ve taken her if his son wouldn\u2019t have been attached to her.</p><p>She pulled back, her breathing uneven and looked down at Jacob\u2019s head. His hand was still resting there and the edge of his thumb was touching her breast. She sucked in another sharp intake of air and twisted, so his hand would have to drop.</p><p>She pulled Jacob to her shoulder and quickly covered herself as she started to burp him. \u201cLet me do that,\u201d he said, while he gently took Jacob and placed him over his own shoulder. Jacob gave a loud burp and started rooting at his shoulder, looking for more food.</p><p>Alex knew there wasn\u2019t any way he could sit and watch her feed his son. He wanted her far too much to sit next to her in the bed any longer. \u201cI\u2019ll let you finish up,\u201d he muttered as he left the room. Two more nights, he told himself as he prepared for a restless night. He would be lucky to get even another few minutes of sleep with the way his body was on fire.</p><p>Jessica breathed a sigh of relief as she watched Alex leave the room. She still had tingles zipping through her body where he\u2019d pressed up against her. She knew he was simply trying to be a part of everything but she didn\u2019t think she had the willpower to resist him. She\u2019d been so lonely and so in need of affection.</p><p>She would be glad when the newness of the baby wore off and he backed off a bit. If he kept coming into her room in the middle of the night she would end up grabbing him and having a repeat performance of their night in the elevator.</p><p>How could one night with a man imprint him so deeply into her soul? She looked at their son and sighed. But Jessica had to be honest with herself and knew it was about so much more than just their son. Alex was dynamic in a way no other man even came close to being. He was intriguing and gorgeous beyond what any man should be gifted. He\u2019d made her laugh and burn in only a few hours\u2019 time.</p><p>She finished feeding Jacob, placed him in bed and fell into a much needed deep sleep.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Jessica was exhausted. Alex had been back for three days and he refused to leave the house. He\u2019d been amazing with their son though, so she had to give him credit for that. He\u2019d even gotten up in the middle of the night so he could change and burp Jacob once she was done feeding him.</p><p>After the first night he\u2019d maintained his distance, thankfully because she didn\u2019t think she could handle anymore late night touching. Every time she was within breathing distance of Alex, her insides twisted into knots and all she wanted to do was reach out to him. She fully blamed the post partum baby hormones.</p><p>Today was the day of her wedding and she felt like she was going to have a panic attack. She had to keep telling herself it would all work out for the best. She went through her morning routine with Jacob, then she was whisked away to the wedding site.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Jacob for you so your mother can help you finish getting ready,\u201d Joseph offered her.</p><p>Jessica jumped at the sound of Joseph\u2019s voice. She hadn\u2019t heard him walk up. The man sure moved quietly for a guy his size, she thought.</p><p>\u201cI would appreciate that, Joseph. He\u2019s had his breakfast so he should be in a good mood for a while,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d Joseph told her and then bent down and placed a kiss on her cheek before heading out of the room.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s mother came in and put the finishing touches on her before they got into position. The walk down the aisle went by in a blur and the next thing she knew the preacher was speaking.</p><p>She was standing at the altar, next to a man she barely knew and was closer to having a panic attack than she\u2019d ever been in her life. He looked so handsome and yet so aloof. She was wishing for some divine intervention to stop the whole circus. Maybe he\u2019d come to his senses and tell her he couldn\u2019t go through with it, or maybe her father would stand up and free her of the obligation.</p><p>None of that happened. Suddenly, the preacher was pronouncing them man and wife. Alex then took her into his arms. The rest of the world disappeared as his mouth fastened onto hers. She\u2019d expected a chaste kiss but she was wrong. He coaxed her mouth open and then slipped his tongue inside.</p><p>Her knees went to jelly and she would\u2019ve slid to the floor if it hadn\u2019t been for his arms supporting her. When there was laughter from the guests and a lot of throat clearing he finally pulled away and she was left to stand with one of his arms around her, staring blankly at the mass of people.</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of time for the honeymoon later,\u201d she heard someone call out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShare that pretty bride of yours. I\u2019m calling the first dance after my brother,\u201d another voice hollered with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou can back off and find your own wife Mark,\u201d Alex said, with jealousy in his tone.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t feel so good to be on this side of the ribbing, huh little brother,\u201d Lucas said and then thumped him on the back.</p><p>Alex knew he deserved the teasing. He\u2019d given Lucas hell, not that long ago when his big brother started dating Amy. Lucas had been trying to fight his attraction towards Amy, so Mark and he had decided to push their brother\u2019s buttons. They\u2019d both planted a kiss on her in front of Lucas and flirted. She\u2019d known they were kidding, trying to get a rise out of their brother but now Alex felt bad for what he\u2019d put Lucas through because he sure as hell wanted to punch out Mark at that moment.</p> <p>A shudder ran through Jessica\u2019s body as she watched the interplay between the brothers. They were all so virile and appealing. She only had eyes for Alex though. He was the sexiest man she\u2019d ever been around and in any other circumstance she would\u2019ve been swooning to be held and kissed by him.</p><p>Jessica glanced over to where her father was laughing at something Joseph said. She tried to stay mad at both men for manipulating the whole situation but she really did love them. She knew they only wanted what they deemed best for her and her son. She just didn\u2019t like the methods they took to get their own way.</p><p>As if the men knew she was thinking about them, they both turned and gave her a smile. She was too frazzled at the moment to even pretend to smile back so she turned away and let her thoughts continue to run.</p><p>Things could be a lot worse, she decided. Alex was a sexy, incredible man and it was obvious he was already in love with his son. She could\u2019ve been forced into a marriage where the man not only resented her but her son as well. She knew no matter how Alex felt about her, he would always love Jacob.</p><p>\u201cTime for photographs,\u201d she heard a voice call. She grimaced until Alex looked at her, with their precious son resting in his arms. For one moment they shared a real smile. Her mask fell away. The love she had for her son and the love starting to grow for Alex was shining through her expression. His breath seemed to catch and he was about to say something, when the camera flash snapped them both out of the moment.</p> <p>He turned from her and spoke so no one else could here. \u201cLet\u2019s get these pictures over with. We don\u2019t need to announce to everyone in the room this is a shot gun wedding.\u201d He placed her arm through his and headed towards the rest of the family.</p><p>\u201cCome on Alex, everyone here knows why we did this so I don\u2019t see why we need to have this huge masquerade. We could\u2019ve just as easily taken care of our marriage in a courthouse and not put on a big show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way my father would ever allow one of his sons to get married that way and I\u2019m sure your father feels the same. Jessica, this marriage may be happening because of our son but we\u2019re married now. It needed to be started this way. Something about our relationship needed to be done correctly,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Jessica gave in without any more protest and allowed the photographer to place her in many different poses with Alex and her family members. She felt as if her cheeks were going to crack, she\u2019d been holding the same expression so long. All she had to do though was look at her son and she was able to continue.</p><p>Jacob may have been an unexpected surprise she didn\u2019t even know she wanted but she couldn\u2019t imagine her life without him. There was nothing she wouldn\u2019t sacrifice for him. She would give up her entire world to make his better. She could live in a loveless marriage because that meant her son was with his father and would be loved, cherished and spoiled.</p><p>The photographer was finally happy with the shots he\u2019d captured and Jessica was able to step away and gain control of herself once more. She heard a hearty laugh and glanced up to see Alex slapping his brother on the back, as his features lit with mirth. She sucked in a breath at the beauty of the man.</p> <p>Alex was the most handsome man she\u2019d ever known. From his dark, silky hair, piercing blue eyes and devastating smile, to his rock hard stomach and sculpted arms. When you added in the confidence, which was as second nature to the man as breathing, he was every woman\u2019s dream come true.</p><p>She knew there were plenty of women who would love to be in her place. They wouldn\u2019t have even cared if Alex loved them or not. They would just love to have him on their arm. He was a trophy for sure. The thought caused a small giggle to bubble up inside of her. She\u2019d heard of all the men with their trophy wives. Well, it looked like she\u2019d snagged herself a trophy husband.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to head out back for the reception,\u201d Joseph said in his booming voice, which could be heard by everyone. The announcement made Jessica\u2019s head snap up to attention. She thought this was the reception. Why did the wedding keep getting bigger and bigger?</p><p>She saw Alex hand their son over to his mother, then he was at her side. \u201cI know you\u2019re tired but in a few more hours we can get out of here and rest,\u201d he reassured her.</p><p>They walked through the huge Anderson mansion and as they crossed through the patio doors, her breath was once again taken away. The backyard had been transformed into a fairytale. She looked around in awe. She\u2019d grown up wealthy but what the Anderson\u2019s had made her family look like middle class.</p><p>There was a white carpet laid out from the back door to a group of tents. Thousands of cascading lights looked like diamonds raining from the sky. Tables were set up with beautiful settings and waiters were at the ready, loaded down with trays of champagne and appetizers.</p><p>A small orchestra was playing in the center of the whole affair, with a beautiful dance floor waiting for people to occupy its space. As they walked out she noticed more people were at the reception than had attended the wedding. She knew some but not all of them.</p><p>\u201cDo you like everything?\u201d Joseph asked, seeming to appear from nowhere.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing but you really didn\u2019t need to go to this much trouble. Some cake and champagne would\u2019ve been fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>Joseph let out a hearty laugh and then leaned down to kiss her cheek. \u201cOnly the best for my boys and the beautiful women they choose to marry,\u201d he said before he walked away to visit with some of the guests in attendance.</p><p>\u201cTry not to feel too overwhelmed. I got really flustered when I walked out these same doors on my wedding day but now I will cherish those memories forever,\u201d Amy said. Jessica was surprised to see Lucas\u2019s wife standing there with her</p><p>Jessica knew the story of Lucas and Amy\u2019s rocky start. Amy had been working for him and found herself pregnant with Lucas\u2019s child. They\u2019d married for the sake of the unborn baby but things had seemed to work out great for them. It was obvious to anyone around them they loved one another. It also seemed Alex was following in his brother\u2019s footsteps and getting married due to an unplanned pregnancy.</p><p>They had one daughter who was over a year old and obviously loved. Amy was also looking very pregnant with baby number two on the way. Their marriage had ended up working out perfectly, which sent a bout of sadness through her. She didn\u2019t see how her and Alex could end up with the happily ever after Amy had gotten.</p><p>\u201cYou startled me,\u201d Jessica finally managed to say. \u201cThis whole thing is a little bit overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how you feel and it doesn\u2019t seem like it right now but you will appreciate all of this someday. You\u2019ll have the pictures to pour over and the memories of the perfect wedding to tell your children,\u201d Amy said comfortingly.</p><p>Jessica didn\u2019t think she would ever be appreciative of the wedding but she wasn\u2019t going to voice that to her new sister-in-law so she decided to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cHow far along are you?\u201d Jessica asked.</p><p>\u201cSix months now,\u201d Amy said, beaming. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier. I love Lucas, Jasmine and this entire family so much. I was in a similar circumstance as you, not that long ago but it worked out so much better than I could\u2019ve ever imagined. This family loves big and I\u2019ve seen the way Alex looks at you. I know you\u2019re scared now but know I\u2019ll be there for you if ever you need a woman to talk to. Things do get better,\u201d she finished and then gave Jessica a hug before joining her husband.</p><p>Jessica watched as the other couple embraced like they\u2019d been apart for months instead of mere minutes. She felt slight jealousy at the obvious love radiating from the happy couple. She didn\u2019t expect to ever have Alex look at her the way Lucas was looking at Amy. She shook herself out of the mood and decided to enjoy her evening, since she wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of it.</p><p>Once Jessica decided to let go of her worries she found herself enjoying the reception. The cake was incredible. It had five layers with water cascading down the center. There were tiny flowers and butterflies created from frosting and she was almost afraid to cut it and ruin the great work of art.</p><p>Alex swiped a piece of the frosting and stuck his finger in his mouth, making her stomach churn with desire. How watching a man lick a bit of frosting off his finger could be so dang sexy, she\u2019d never know?</p><p>When Alex\u2019s hand fit gently over hers, they cut the cake and her worries fell away. Whenever he touched her, the rest of the world could tumble down and she wouldn\u2019t notice. She looked up into his eyes and forgot what they were doing. He leaned down and kissed her intimately, to the delight of the crowd. His mouth tasted sweet from the frosting and she could feel shivers running down her spine.</p><p>The laughter pulled Jessica from her thoughts. She gently fed him and the look of lust in his eyes as her fingers grazed his mouth made her knees go weak. She started to tremble, praying the rest of the audience didn\u2019t notice. Then he fed her a small piece of cake and heat shot throughout her body. She sucked his finger into her mouth and the lust instantly in his eyes was enough to drop her to her knees.</p><p>When he wiped a piece of frosting from her lips and then licked the tip of his finger, she actually swooned. She thought swooning was just a Hollywood movie moment but if he hadn\u2019t been there to pull her close she would\u2019ve fallen into the table.</p><p>His eyes smoldered to a dangerous level and he pulled her close, kissing her with far less restraint than he\u2019d exhibited earlier. She wrapped her arms around his neck and gave into the passion she\u2019d been feeling since he\u2019d first stepped through her door.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s some great cake,\u201d she heard the chuckling voice of her father.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s head snapped back and she stared at her husband with horror. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d kissed him like that in front of so many people. He smiled down at her and turned toward the guests.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get this over with. I want my wife to myself,\u201d he said with laughter.</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d she heard Lucas shout, as he lifted his glass to toast the couple.</p><p>Jessica heard the sound of Jacob letting his mom know it was time for his own dinner and was relieved to get a few minutes of privacy, as she took him into the house to eat. As she rocked Jacob, she reflected on the overwhelming day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d watched Alex with her son and wanted to think he was only marrying her because he was trapped into it. But she knew he genuinely loved Jacob. She knew he was happy to be a father. It wasn\u2019t what either one of them had expected but he\u2019d quickly taken to his role as father and he was doing an amazing job.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t anxious to get back out to the reception. She knew most of the people out there had to be talking about how poor Alex had to marry to make his son legitimate. It made her very uncomfortable. Even though no one had treated her badly or said anything negative, they had to be thinking she\u2019d trapped him. Even though she had plenty of her own money, Alex Anderson was a real catch. He could literally choose any bride he wanted but the choice had been stolen from him the minute he found out he was a father.</p><p>As Jessica took a few moments longer rocking Jacob, she heard footsteps enter the softly lit den. \u201cI\u2019m glad to have a few moments to speak with you alone,\u201d Joseph said softly. \u201cI know all of this has been a little overwhelming for you and I just wanted to let you know how happy I am you\u2019re a part of our family,\u201d he continued, as he sat down next to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased to join your family, Joseph. This is all quite overwhelming though,\u201d she finished speaking with a nervous laugh.</p> <p>\u201cI understand how you feel Jessica but know you have a lot of people to turn to for support. Also remember that lasting marriages have started with less going for them that what you and Alex have. I think your union is off to a great start. You have this beautiful baby boy and it\u2019s obvious to anyone who watches, you and Alex have chemistry. I can understand if you\u2019re afraid to admit love yet but I see the way you look at my boy and it fills my heart with joy,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Jessica didn\u2019t know what to say. She didn\u2019t want to admit her growing love for Alex but she couldn\u2019t tell his father a lie either so she thought it best to simply keep silent.</p><p>\u201cLet me take that amazing grandson of mine and lay him down so you can get back out to the party,\u201d Joseph offered. She was reluctant to hand Jacob over but knew she was just being silly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d was her only reply and then empty handed again, she had no choice but to head back outdoors.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for our first dance as a married couple,\u201d Alex said to her, taking her hand and pulling her onto the dance floor. All her worries washed away again as he pulled her close into his arms. Dancing intimately with him was a prelude to sex. The way he moved his hips against hers and rubbed on her lower back had her insides burning.</p> <p>When he bent down and kissed her on the neck, goose bumps appeared and a light shiver spread throughout her middle. He gazed into her eyes and neither of them needed to say a word. Her breathing increased as he whirled her around the floor and she breathed a sigh of relief as the song came to an end.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think she would\u2019ve been able to remain in his arms much longer without beginning to undress him. She\u2019d never been such a wanton woman before she\u2019d met Alex.</p><p>The next half hour passed slowly as she was passed from one person to the next on the dance floor. She enjoyed her father-daughter dance and a few tears fell as he told her how much he would miss his little girl being only his.</p><p>She laughed with both Lucas and Mark, genuinely enjoying Alex\u2019s brothers. She couldn\u2019t understand how Mark hadn\u2019t been snatched up yet. Of course, from her understanding, all the Anderson males held onto their bachelorhood like a rancher held onto his prize bull.</p><p>After being whisked around, she was once again in Alex\u2019s arms and it felt like coming home. \u201cAre you ready to get out of here,\u201d he whispered in her ear. Before she had a chance to reply, the music stopped.</p><p>\u201cI hope everyone is having a great time,\u201d Joseph spoke into the microphone. There was an outbreak of applause at his words.</p> <p>\u201cGood, good. Now I would like to make a toast for my son and beautiful daughter-in-law. I couldn\u2019t be happier to have you join our family, Jessica. You are a true blessing and a perfect match for our stubborn son, who we happen to think is just about perfect. Although, we were worried no woman would ever put up with him.\u201d The crowd erupted with laughter.</p><p>\u201cAll joking aside, we\u2019re grateful for this union and the blessing of our first grandson. Katherine and I both wish you the best and hope your marriage will be filled with laughter, joy and surprises. And best of all, remember a little fight now and again makes life exciting and gives you a chance to make up,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cKatherine and I have a wedding gift for you we couldn\u2019t quite gift wrap,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cA new family needs a real home and not to be living in some apartment in the city. We got you a place about a mile down the road from here. It\u2019s all set up for a nice honeymoon since Jessica doesn\u2019t want to leave somewhere without the baby. We do insist on babysitting so you two can get some alone time together though,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Jessica gasped at his words. She couldn\u2019t believe Joseph and Katherine had bought them a house. What if this all fell apart within a week, or even a month? So many people were already involved in their union and now they would have a home, which she would get attached to. She watched as Alex strode over to his father and gave him a huge hug, then did the same for his mom.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize tears were falling down her cheeks until Alex came back and gently wiped them away. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the place, we can find something different,\u201d he said, mistaking her anxiety.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just we aren\u2019t in a real marriage. This is all too much.\u201d She couldn\u2019t say anymore and quickly hugged Joseph and Katherine and then excused herself to check on the baby.</p><p>Alex stood there, shocked for a few moments and then he was angry. He\u2019d been enjoying the wedding and his bride and then she had to remind him it was a forced marriage. He knew she was having a hard time with the whole situation but a lot of people had gone the extra mile to make it enjoyable for her. He needed to keep his guard up around her or he could see himself getting hurt deeply.</p><p>The party finally slowed down and they were able to make their escape. Jessica gathered up Jacob, while Alex grabbed their bags and they ran through the throng of people to the awaiting limo.</p> <p>Birdseed flew at them and cameras snapped and they were both more than grateful to be inside the safe confines of the limo. They didn\u2019t have a very far drive, thanks to the generosity of his parents.</p><p>Jessica was exhausted and more nervous than ever being alone with her husband. Was he going to expect her to sleep with him, or would she be allowed her own room? Did she even want her own room? The thought of sharing a house with the virile, masculine Alex and not sleeping with him seemed worse.</p><p>She was going to have to wait and see what happened.</p><p>They arrived at the gated driveway within a few minutes. Jessica rolled her window down to look out. The driveway seemed endless and was flanked by huge pine trees on either side, giving privacy to the house still hidden from view. When they turned another corner, the driveway opened up to a huge circular turn-around done in colored bricks. In the center was an enormous water fountain with angels dancing in the center, looking as if they were splashing each other.</p><p>Jessica didn\u2019t know what to say. The home was a smaller version of the Anderson Mansion. There were three stories with wrap around balconies on each level. There were five huge columns across the front, giving the home a southern plantation look. She was immediately in love with the place. She was afraid to step inside because the minute she did she knew she\u2019d be even more in love and never want to leave. She had plenty of her own money. When things in the marriage failed, as she knew they would, maybe he would allow her to buy the place and stay there. She was tired of apartment living anyway.</p><p>The driver opened her door and she reached in for Jacob but Alex had him already. \u201cI can take him,\u201d she said, not liking him taking control all of the time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him. Go ahead and check out the house. I\u2019ll come back for the bags in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue with his high-handedness but decided it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. He would win once again but she was exhausted. The door opened, which surprised her, as she didn\u2019t know anyone was there.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. and Mrs. Anderson. I have a snack prepared for you in the kitchen and your room has been prepared. Would you like me to lay down the baby so you can look around?\u201d</p><p>Alex handed Jacob over to the woman, which Jessica immediately was going to protest. She wasn\u2019t going to let him hand her child over to a stranger. \u201cJessica, this is Tina, our cook. She\u2019s worked for my family for over twenty years and is one hundred percent trustworthy,\u201d he said, noticing her concern.</p><p>Jessica still wanted to rip her baby away from the stranger but knew she would look bad in doing so. \u201cI will walk with you to the nursery so I know where Jacob is. Are baby monitors set up so I\u2019ll be able to hear him in other parts of the house?\u201d Jessica asked with concern.</p><p>\u201cYes, and you can carry around portable listening and video devices so you know your precious one is safe at all times,\u201d Tina reassured Jessica, as they walked up the grand staircase.</p><p>They reached the second story and walked down a well lit hallway. \u201cThis is the master bedroom, here to the right and the baby\u2019s room is right here across the hall. Mr. Anderson said you\u2019d want the baby close by.\u201d Tina pointed out a few more doorways and then led Jessica into a lovely baby\u2019s room. The walls were identical to what she\u2019d done at her old place. Alex must have taken pictures and had someone reproduce her artwork. All her nursery items were there, along with many new things. She noticed the camera angled in the corner and felt some relief.</p><p>Tina laid Jacob in his crib and Jessica bent down to kiss his soft cheek and cover him up. She could stand there all day and night watching him sleep.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the monitor, Mrs. Anderson,\u201d Tina said, handing over a small device. Jessica looked at it and not only were their voices coming through but there was a small screen showing her son sleeping in his crib.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much Tina,\u201d Jessica said with real gratitude. The home was very large and she would feel comforted being able to keep an eye on her son no matter where she was.</p><p>Jessica turned to find Alex right behind her. \u201cI tried to match Jacob\u2019s old room as much as possible,\u201d he said in explanation of the decorations. \u201cMy father bought this home a while ago waiting for the day one of us would choose to settle down,\u201d That explained how he\u2019d been able to have the nursery prepared.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely, thank you. It has a lot more room than his old one,\u201d she said honestly. She really did like the room. She liked everything about the home.</p><p>\u201cThis door over here leads to the nanny\u2019s room...Now before you protest, we\u2019ll hire one together and I\u2019m not expecting you to not take care of our son. It\u2019s simply a good idea to have a nanny here to help you. That way you can have some free time to do whatever it is you want or need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, in no way need a nanny.\u201d She wasn\u2019t happy about him thinking he could control everything. She\u2019d been doing fine taking care of her son on her own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour father told me you had a passion for writing but hadn\u2019t been able to do any the last few months because you were either too exhausted or taking care of our son. I just want to give you a chance to be able to do what you need to do. You can still be with him full time. The nanny can be more of a helper for when you need her,\u201d he spoke reasonably.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d was all she said. The thought of writing again was tempting but she would feel like such a bad parent, passing her child off to a stranger. She would at least consider the possibility.</p><p>Alex took her around the rest of the home. The home was decorated in a way she would\u2019ve done herself. Some of the rooms reminded her of her childhood home. She loved everything about it. They arrived in the kitchen, where two other staff members were waiting for them.</p><p>\u201cThis is Edward, our gardener. He\u2019s married to Tina. They live in the cottage on the back of the property. This is Maria, our housekeeper. They\u2019ve all been with the family as long as Tina, which is why I wanted them here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really great to meet all of you,\u201d Jessica said, while shaking their hands. The staff left them to eat the food and then an uncomfortable silence fell between them. Tina had said master bedroom. She wasn\u2019t ready to share a room with her husband nightly. She needed more time to protect herself, to keep her heart out of it.</p><p>She would keep her things in that room but sleep in the nanny\u2019s room for now. When the silence seemed to stretch on forever, Jacob\u2019s cry came over the baby monitor. She jumped up in relief to get away from Alex and take care of her son.</p><p>Jessica changed Jacob, then fed him and was laying him down when Alex walked into the room. \u201cHold on, I want to kiss him goodnight,\u201d he said, before gently kissing Jacob\u2019s head. She had a very difficult time staying angry with Alex when he was always so loving towards their son.</p><p>They both stood over the crib for a few moments, both of them content watching him sleep peacefully. \u201cLet me show you to your room,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jessica breathed a sigh of relief, although she also felt a tiny twinge of disappointment at the same time. This is what she wanted, she had to remind herself. She didn\u2019t want to share his bed, yet she felt bad he didn\u2019t seem to want her at all. She was a little curvier since she\u2019d had the baby. Maybe he was turned off by her new body.</p> <p>Alex led her into the master bedroom. There was enough space for an entire apartment to fit into the huge room. The master closet was the size of her old bedroom. She stepped into the bathroom and was immediately in love. She didn\u2019t say another word to Alex. She shut the bathroom door and started filling up the huge tub.</p><p>Jessica had to chuckle to herself at the size of the tub. It was large enough for a few people to have a hot tub party in it. After adding some soap from a bowl on the side of the tub, she placed her hair in a bun and stepped into the hot water. As she sank down to her chin and the bubbles surrounded her, a sigh of ecstasy escaped her lips.</p><p>Jessica finally relaxed and let the scents take her stress and worries away. She stayed in for over an hour, then finally managed to pull herself out of the cooled water. She wrapped herself in one of the luxurious, oversized towels and stepped through the doorway.</p><p>She wanted nothing more than to crawl into the huge four-post bed. She started to pull the towel away and noticed Alex sitting on the bed in nothing but a pair of pajama pants. She sucked in her breath at the raw power rolling off of him. He had to be the sexiest guy she\u2019d ever seen. With clothes on he was enough to accelerate your heart, with them off he could cause cardiac arrest.</p><p>\u201cWh...what are you doing here?\u201d she stuttered. She was praying he wouldn\u2019t come towards her because if he took her into his arm she would cave quickly. She couldn\u2019t seem to say no to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you. How was your bath? I was beginning to get worried, you took so long,\u201d he said casually.</p> <p>Jessica braced her shoulders. She knew she had to get all of her words out quickly or she\u2019d lose her courage to do so. \u201cAlex, I know we\u2019re married but I\u2019m not sharing a room with you. I can use the one next to our son\u2019s,\u201d she finished weakly.</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes went from casual to smoldering in one second flat. He slowly stood up and walked towards her. He was like a panther, stalking his prey. Her stomach felt like it was crawling up into her throat, she was so tense.</p><p>She wanted to be in his arms and knew it would be fantastic but she needed to protect herself. It wouldn\u2019t take much to fall head over heels in love with him. She took an involuntary step back and then another, as he got closer to her.</p><p>He slowly looked at her from her head to her toes and back up again, without saying a word. When he finally reached her eyes again, they were both breathing heavily. He placed one hand behind her neck and the other at the small of her back and jerked her into his body.</p><p>\u201cAlex, this isn\u2019t a good id...\u201d she tried to tell him but he swallowed her words as his lips took possession of hers. He kissed her with anger, passion and need. She tried not to respond but after a few seconds she was giving just as good as she got.</p><p>Her hands wrapped around the back of his head to pull him even closer. He was pressing her stomach into his obvious arousal. Knowing he wanted her was like throwing a lit match into a puddle of gasoline.</p><p>His hand slid down past the bottom of the towel and began touching the bare skin at the top of her thighs. She pressed even closer and a moan escaped her lips. He pulled back and turned away from her.</p><p>They both stood there, trying to catch their breaths. Alex cursed himself. He hadn\u2019t meant for the kiss to go that far. She had a way of blocking out every thought in his head except for his desire to take her.</p> <p>He finally gained control over his raging body and turned to face her again. Her breasts were still heaving with the deep breaths she was taking in. He could tell she was trying to gain control and not doing a very good job of it. He almost lost his will to turn away from her, at the look of desire in her eyes. He had to prove a point though. He knew later when he was standing in a cold shower he\u2019d have to try very hard to remember what that point was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife. You will be sharing my bed and you will be my wife in every way that matters. I will not disgrace my son, or my family, by having affairs and in case you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m a man with needs. This marriage is for better or worse and we\u2019ll make the best of the situation.\u201d He said all of this in a smooth, calm voice making her temper was rise.</p><p>How dare he tell her what she would and wouldn\u2019t do! He wasn\u2019t her boss. Yes, he\u2019d strong-armed her into a marriage for the sake of their son and their families but she wouldn\u2019t be at his beck and call.</p><p>Alex was enjoying the light of temper entering her passionate eyes. She was so easy to read and he could see she was ready to explode. The desire in him was growing. It was going to take all he had to walk from the room. He didn\u2019t want to take her in anger. He respected her far too much for that.</p><p>Jessica walked up to him and slapped him hard across the face. He stood there, too stunned to move for a moment. When she saw the anger light his face, she backed up quickly, realizing she most likely had made a huge mistake.</p><p>He caught her arm and whipped her back around to face him, \u201cif you slap me again, you will feel my wrath,\u201d he snarled.</p><p>\u201cYou will not tell me what to do or how to be a wife. Our marriage doesn\u2019t give you power over me. It doesn\u2019t mean I will be sharing your bed. I make my own choices and decisions. No one makes them for me,\u201d she said, with far more bravado than she actually felt.</p><p>Alex smiled at her with his normal confidence. \u201cYou want me just as badly as I want you. I won\u2019t make you have sex with me, you\u2019ll be begging me for it.\u201d He then kissed her quickly and walked to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll give you tonight, alone, so you can miss me. Tomorrow and every night after, we\u2019ll sleep in the same bed. The sex will be entirely up to you.\u201d</p><p>With those words he walked out the door, leaving Jessica standing there, angry because she feared he was right. He barely left and she wanted to call him back to her. She sighed, knowing it was going to be a long night alone in the empty bed.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Jessica walked down the stairs with Jacob in her arms. She was cranky and exhausted. Sleep had been elusive the previous night and it showed. After the parting kiss from Alex, she\u2019d stirred in bed thinking about him, with her body on fire. To top that off, when she\u2019d finally started to drift into a restless sleep Jacob woke and decided after he ate he wanted to stay awake for a while and play.</p><p>Alex stayed away from her for the night like he\u2019d promised. By the second hour she\u2019d walked the floors with Jacob she was thinking her decision for him to stay away may have been made a bit too hastily.</p><p>She knew she had circles under her eyes. She didn\u2019t bother with any make-up and was wearing old sweats and a baggy t-shirt. She didn\u2019t even care if she looked like something the cat had drug in. She just wanted some hot coffee and about twelve hours of uninterrupted sleep.</p><p>\u201cGood morning Mrs. Anderson. Would you like me to take Jacob so you can eat some breakfast,\u201d asked Tina, while she placed a cup of wonderful smelling coffee in front of her?</p><p>Jessica almost replied no, as she was so used to taking care of her son on her own but the aromas coming from the kitchen had her changing her mind. \u201cThat would be wonderful, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d she finally replied.</p><p>\u201cMy husband Edward and I, weren\u2019t blessed with children of our own. I will really enjoy having a baby in the house. I\u2019m looking forward to spoiling him rotten,\u201d Tina said with a wink and a smile. Tina took Jacob in her arms and when he smiled at her she laughed with real joy, making him smile even more.</p><p>Jessica relaxed, knowing her son was in good hands. \u201cI will have Maria bring your breakfast out. Enjoy your meal,\u201d Tina said, then walked into the kitchen with Jacob in her arms. Jessica ate her meal in silence and felt her eyes start to droop.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe how tired she was all the time. She would really like to sleep for eight full hours straight, a luxury every new mother wanted. It was worth more than any amount of money in the world.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, I hope you slept well,\u201d said Alex, sounding far too happy. Jessica snapped fully awake at once. He didn\u2019t look as if he\u2019d lost any sleep, she thought accusingly. In fact, he looked as if he\u2019d never lost a night of sleep in his life. She was a little envious of him right then.</p><p>\u201cI slept great,\u201d she lied. She refused to look up and make eye contact with him.</p><p>Alex sat down across from her and Maria placed his coffee and food in front of him. \u201cThank you Maria,\u201d he said. The conversation halted, while he dug into his breakfast.</p><p>Alex was surprised by the punch of lust he was feeling. Jessica looked exhausted, obviously she hadn\u2019t slept well. For that matter, he hadn\u2019t slept well either. He was just hiding it a lot better than her. Even with circles under her eyes and dressed in such baggy clothes, she looked far sexier than any woman he\u2019d ever seen. She had a natural appeal about her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alex leaned over her to grab the salt and saw her eyes widen. Jessica almost gasped out loud. She wasn\u2019t happy when she saw the knowing look come into his eyes. He knew how he affected her and he was already far too full of himself. She wouldn\u2019t stroke his ego even more by letting him know how deeply he affected her.</p><p>They ate in an awkward silence, while Jessica tried to regain her composure. She didn\u2019t like how her world always seemed to stop turning whenever he was around her. She would bet objects would just naturally fall from the sky and land at his feet, if he commanded them to do so.</p><p>\u201cI have some work to do here in the home office. If you need anything, you can come and get me,\u201d he finally spoke after several moments.</p><p>Jessica simply nodded her head. She then rose from the table and headed toward the kitchen. There was a basinet off in the corner and her son was sleeping soundly. She smiled down at her precious baby.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Anderson, if you\u2019d like to lie down for a while, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on Jacob. You have several bottles already pumped if he wakes up hungry,\u201d Tina said kindly.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s initial reaction was to refuse. But she wouldn\u2019t be any good to him if she didn\u2019t get some rest. There was a houseful of people more than willing and happy to help her. It wasn\u2019t selfish to get a bit more rest.</p><p>\u201cThank you Tina, I\u2019ll take you up on your offer. Please wake me if you need anything.\u201d Jessica placed a kiss on her son\u2019s head and then headed back up the stairs. She climbed into bed and quickly fell into an exhausted sleep. She didn\u2019t stir for four hours.</p><p>When she woke, she felt disoriented. She wasn\u2019t used to taking long naps and she panicked for a moment when she noticed the time. She quickly relaxed, knowing if there\u2019d been any problems someone would\u2019ve woken her.</p><p>She climbed into the shower and washed the sleep away. Taking long showers was another luxury new mothers had to give up. She was always so paranoid Jacob would need her while she was showering and wouldn\u2019t hear him. This was actually absurd, considering she knew how loud her son could get when unhappy about something.</p> <p>She got dressed and headed back down the stairs. She found Jacob in the living room with Alex. Her son was wide awake, making little grumbling noises at his father. Alex seemed to be transfixed. She watched them for a few minutes. The unguarded way her husband interacted with his son was something special to see. She knew she\u2019d made the right choice in marrying him. He obviously loved Jacob immensely.</p><p>She made a noise and he looked up to see her standing in the doorway. He quickly guarded his expression and she felt a bit let down. Their relationship wasn\u2019t going to get any easier, anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cYou have great timing,\u201d Alex began, \u201cour son was just telling me he wanted some food.\u201d He smiled, as his eyes once again went to their son. Jessica walked closer to them and when Jacob noticed her, his noises escalated and his legs kicked out. He knew food was nearby and he was letting his mom know he wanted it.</p><p>Jessica smiled, while bending down to pick Jacob up. Her hand brushed against Alex\u2019s lap and their eyes locked for a moment. He quickly inhaled and his eyes darkened in desire. He needed his wife and the sooner he had her, the better.</p><p>Jessica quickly gathered the baby and sat down on the far end of the couch. Her fingertips were tingling, where they\u2019d brushed him. She had no idea how she was supposed to continue to fight the desire she had for the man. He was potent. She wanted him far more than she\u2019d ever wanted another man. She hadn\u2019t been with anyone since her night with him in the elevator and her body was aching to be taken.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to feed him here,\u201d she finally said to him. He usually left her in privacy to feed their son but apparently he wasn\u2019t willing to this time.</p> <p>\u201cGo ahead, I\u2019m going to catch the end of the game,\u201d he replied.</p><p>There were no blankets nearby and Jacob was getting ready to throw a full blown fit any minute, as he started rooting around on the outside of her blouse. Jessica turned slightly away from Alex, trying to give herself some semblance of privacy and quickly latched her son on. He greedily started to eat and Jessica relaxed and watched the game with Alex, without saying anything else.</p><p>Alex sat on the couch, a few short feet away from Jessica. He knew he should give her the privacy she wanted but he simply didn\u2019t want to leave the two of them. He liked them being in the room with him. He\u2019d been giving her some distance and finally decided, enough with the space. He wanted them to be right next to him and he was going to have that.</p><p>He got up and sat down right beside Jessica, so their legs, hips and shoulders were touching. He then flung his arm over the back of the couch so her back was pressed up against his chest. He felt her tense at the close proximity but she kept silent. He said nothing, just continued to watch the game, although there was no way he could\u2019ve told anyone what the score was, or even who was playing. He could only think of her.</p><p>She finished feeding their son and quickly covered up, then transferred him to her shoulder and began burping him. Jacob\u2019s big eyes looked up at his father sleepily and Alex couldn\u2019t resist rubbing his bald head.</p><p>\u201cDid you get enough to eat?\u201d Jacob\u2019s responses to his father\u2019s words were some coos. Alex chuckled and sat there, enjoying Jessica pressed up closely to him, as well as their son in her arms. He could definitely get used to the marriage thing and wouldn\u2019t mind having a few more kids running around in front of him. The thought sobered him. He\u2019d never pictured himself as the settle down kind of guy but the more time he spent with Jessica and their son, the more married life appealed to him.</p><p>They sat there for a while, Jessica finally allowing herself to enjoy the two men in her life. She would try to keep her distance but it was becoming harder with every passing moment. Alex\u2019s scent was enveloping her and she was hard pressed to keep him at an emotional distance. Even though she\u2019d just slept for four hours, before she knew it she felt her eyes begin to drift shut. Oh well, she thought, she would just close them for a few moments and rest.</p><p>Jessica woke to find herself wrapped tightly against Alex. His arms were locked around her and they were lying down, with a cover over them, on the over-sized couch. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jacob?\u201d she asked in panic.</p> <p>\u201cTina took him a while ago,\u201d Alex replied sleepily.</p><p>Their faces were inches apart and without another word, he closed the gap between them and kissed her with all of his pent up need. She responded without thought. He turned their bodies and was suddenly on top of her, pressing her down into the couch. His hands were roving over her, while his mouth worked magic on her body. He broke contact with her lips and ran his tongue over her throat, causing a moan to escape her lips.</p><p>When his hand ran up from her hip to cup her breast, she throbbed with pleasure. She wanted him so badly and her body was responding to each movement he made. He began unbuttoning her blouse and trailing his lips down her neck, toward her barely covered breasts. She grabbed his head, pulling him back to her lips. She needed to feel his mouth pressed against hers.</p><p>She pressed her hips into his arousal, making him groan with pleasure. He fastened his lips back on hers and was close to taking her right there in the living room where anyone could walk in at any moment. She finally came to her senses and pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cAlex, someone could walk in,\u201d she said, panting.</p><p>He wanted to ignore her words and continue with the seduction but she was right. There were too many people in the house and he wanted to take his time loving his wife without interruption. She would be his again later that night.</p><p>He sat up and she quickly got to her feet. He walked over to the bar and poured himself a shot of bourbon, downing it in one gulp, then decided it wasn\u2019t enough and decided to take one more. The burning liquid down his throat did its job and his hormones calmed down somewhat. His desire was banked down but the flame was still burning. His body wasn\u2019t going to simmer down until he took her again. Finally it wouldn\u2019t be in an elevator a couch. It would be in their bed where he could love her all night long.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a glass of wine?\u201d He finally asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes please but only half a glass. I\u2019m still nursing and can\u2019t consume more than that,\u201d she replied. She normally didn\u2019t even have that much but her nerves were frayed.</p><p>He poured her a half glass, then walked over to the fireplace to stoke the flames and add some more wood. He was giving them both the needed time to breath. They were seriously both ready to explode from the passion waiting to be ignited fully and then sated.</p><p>\u201cWe have a few nannies coming in today for interviews,\u201d he finally said after she\u2019d taken a few sips. She immediately tensed up again. \u201cI\u2019ve already told you if you don\u2019t like any of the candidates we won\u2019t hire them,\u201d he added, defensively.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she replied and then left the room to check on her son. He was fine, of course so she had some lunch, then went out to the pool to enjoy some sun.</p><p>About an hour passed before Tina stepped outside. \u201cMrs. Anderson, you have a guest in the living room waiting for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you Tina. I\u2019ll be right in.\u201d</p><p>Jessica reluctantly dragged herself back inside the house and found Alex sitting in the living room with a pleasant looking woman. She appeared to be in her fifties, with eyes that sparkled and had laugh lines around them. Jessica didn\u2019t want to like the woman. She didn\u2019t want to admit the need for a nanny.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Mrs. Anderson. I\u2019m Julia Scott. I\u2019m hoping to help you take care of your precious son.\u201d The woman stood up and shook Jessica\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to meet you, Julia. I\u2019m sure Alex told you I\u2019m still unsure if I want to hire a nanny.\u201d She felt obliged to be fully honest to the woman.</p><p>\u201cI understand it\u2019s a scary thing to leave your child in the care of a stranger. Why don\u2019t we just get to know each other a bit and go from there,\u201d the woman replied kindly.</p><p>The three of them spoke for a while, then Jacob woke up from his nap. Jessica fed him before handing him to Julia. Julia had worked for the same family for fifteen years until all the kids grew up. She was now looking for a new family. Jessica could find nothing wrong with her and the thought of someone helping out with the baby was beginning to look more appealing.</p><p>\u201cYour son is very beautiful,\u201d Julia said after a little while. Jacob was sitting on her lap playing with one of his teething rings.</p><p>\u201cWe sure think so,\u201d Alex stated proudly.</p><p>\u201cI think all children are a gift and precious of course but Jacob is very mild mannered. Is this unusual or is he a happy baby for the most part?\u201d Julia questioned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an exceptionally good baby. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of babies staying up all night and having colic, crying for hours and hours on end. I\u2019ve had none of those problems so far with Jacob. He wakes every few hours, which is normal but he\u2019s never had any problems. The only time he fusses is when he\u2019s hungry,\u201d Jessica said fondly.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter to me either way,\u201d Julia said. \u201cIf a baby is crying there\u2019s a reason for it. He\u2019s either hungry, needs changed, needs some extra love, or is hurting and trying to tell you about it. One of my previous kids was very colicky. We would walk the floors for hours on end. It was just an excuse for me to get to cuddle with him longer,\u201d she remembered fondly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessica could tell she was telling the truth. The woman seemed to have unending patience, which was definitely a must for a child care provider. She was shocked to find she did like the woman.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I hate to leave this precious little one, I will get going and let you both get back to your day,\u201d Julia said and then handed Jacob back to Jessica.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss things and get back to you within the next couple of days. I have all your information. We really appreciate you coming by and spending so much time with us today,\u201d Alex said, as he led Julia from the room.</p><p>\u201cThank you both very much. You have a beautiful family and I would love to be a part of it,\u201d Julia replied, then left.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Alex asked her.</p><p>\u201cI think she seemed pretty great. I guess the idea of a nanny wouldn\u2019t be all bad. It was nice to be able to take a nap today,\u201d Jessica conceded. Her face turned a shade of red, as she was picturing the way she\u2019d woken up from her second nap that afternoon.</p><p>Alex\u2019s eyes darkened, also remembering the pleasant way they\u2019d awoken. His hands itched to grab her and pull her close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already run the background check and verified her references. Her last family couldn\u2019t say enough great things about her. The kids all remain in contact with her and consider her an honorary aunt. They adore her and the family begged her to stay on with them, even after the kids had grown but she told them she needed to continue to be a nanny. She loves young ones far too much to give that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess there\u2019d be nothing wrong with trying it out,\u201d Jessica conceded. \u201cJust make sure to tell her we aren\u2019t sure if it will be a permanent situation,\u201d she added, not sure if she wanted to commit to a nanny long term.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her a call. She already told me she could begin tomorrow.\u201d He left the room and Jessica was a little nervous with how quickly things were moving along.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon and evening flew by. Alex spent most of his time in his home office and Jacob was fussy, requiring all of Jessica\u2019s attention. She was grateful to have gotten the nap in, because she had a feeling it was going to be a very long night.</p><p>Alex helped her walk Jacob around during the evening. She was trying to stay unattached but he made it very difficult when he was amazing.</p><p>Around nine that evening Jacob\u2019s fever broke and he finally fell asleep. Both Alex and Jessica were happy he was feeling better and breathed sighs of relief as they stared down at their sleeping child.</p><p>The crying didn\u2019t bother either of them. They just felt powerless with their son not feeling good and not being able to do more than walk him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cutting his first tooth and it\u2019s hard on him. I think the worst of it\u2019s over now,\u201d she said, in explanation of Jacob\u2019s illness.</p> <p>\u201cI wish there was more I could do,\u201d Alex replied.</p><p>\u201cI know. But the best thing to do is cuddle him and walk around. He enjoys the motion and I think getting to look around helps him to not feel the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to bed. I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d Alex said, while he turned towards their bedroom.</p><p>Jessica hesitated. Alex had said he wouldn\u2019t push her into anything but she knew he didn\u2019t really have to push. She wasn\u2019t sure if she was ready yet to share a bed with him. She\u2019d already involved her feelings way too much into the marriage and was afraid to hand over her entire heart.</p><p>\u201cJessica, we aren\u2019t going to do anything you don\u2019t want to. Let\u2019s just go to bed,\u201d he repeated to her. She could see the irritation in his eyes and hear it in his voice. She knew he didn\u2019t like that he had to push his wife into sleeping with him.</p><p>\u201cFine Alex, I agreed to this marriage so I\u2019ll share the bed. I\u2019m sorry if I misled you on the couch today but I don\u2019t want to have sex.\u201d She finished talking and stepped ahead of him into the room. She grabbed her favorite pajamas and went to the bathroom to change.</p><p>\u201cYou can try to run but you want this just as much as I do,\u201d Alex whispered, far too quietly for Jessica to hear. He knew it was going to be a long night. He was determined to have her come to him though. He knew it wouldn\u2019t take long.</p><p>Alex climbed into bed, wearing nothing but boxer shorts. He only kept those on out of deference to her. He preferred to sleep in the nude. He was lying on his back, with his hands under his head and the covers were only pulled up to his waist.</p> <p>Jessica took a deep breath at the sight of him when she walked out of the bathroom. He was unbelievably sexy. He had the perfect amount of muscles, rippling with each movement he made. His stomach was hard and defined and the trail of hair on his lower stomach disappeared under the blanket, causing her mouth to water. She wanted to trail her fingers over him, finding all his favorite spots. Even as exhausted as she was feeling, she knew she\u2019d be lucky to get any sleep lying there next to him.</p><p>He said nothing to her but followed her every move as she slowly walked to her side of the bed. She quickly jumped under the covers, turning away from him, hugging the edge of the bed like it was a lifeboat. She pulled the covers up to her chin and started counting sheep. He flicked off the bedside lamp and before she knew it, exhaustion took her into blissful nothingness.</p><p>Alex lay there, hard and aching. He knew if he reached out and pulled her close, she would easily succumb to him. But he didn\u2019t want to coerce her. He wanted her to come to him willingly. If that meant he needed to take a few cold showers while he waited then that\u2019s what he\u2019d do. He finally drifted into a restless sleep.</p><p>Alex woke up with Jessica pressed up against him. He was lying on his back with her facing him. Her leg was wrapped over both of his and her arm was around his lower stomach. Her head was resting on his shoulder, placing her mouth mere inches away from his own.</p><p>He glanced at the clock, noticing it was midnight. They\u2019d been in bed only a couple of hours. She must\u2019ve drifted over to him in her sleep. He was too tired and far too turned on to play the gentleman.</p><p>She started to stir and wiggled against him, causing his body to physically jerk in the air. He could feel himself begin to pulse. He wanted to bury himself deep inside of her and damn the consequences.</p><p>He turned so they were facing each other and his hands started roaming over her body. She pushed into him, letting out a moan of pleasure, starting to wake up. Her leg was still wrapped over him, though when he turned it caused his erection to be centered on her core. Only a wisp of fabric separating the two of them.</p><p>He ran his tongue over her bottom lip and her eyes parted slightly, at the same time another moan escaped her lips. He then gripped the back of her head and kissed her passionately. She woke up fully and kissed him back just as urgently.</p><p>His hands began to explore her once again and he stopped the kiss long enough to pull her nightgown over her head. He then resumed the kiss, pulling her so tightly against him, not a wisp of air could\u2019ve gotten through. Her hips were moving against his erection and he was afraid their lovemaking would end far too soon.</p><p>He flipped her onto her back and moved his mouth down to her full breasts. She arched her back as his tongue ran over her budded nipple. He licked and caressed the fullness of her breasts, making her jerk upward, seeking more. He wanted to give them far more attention but was conscious of her nursing and knew too much play would cause problems. Instead he ran his tongue down the center of them and then nibbled his way across her stomach.</p><p>She was pleading with him to take her. He was close to doing just that but he would make sure their time together was good for her too. The only other time they\u2019d made love, in the elevator, had ended far too quickly.</p><p>He ripped the last barrier between them away from her body and then his mouth was kissing her in the most intimate way possible. She jerked her hips in the air as pleasure washed over her. \u201cAlex please...\u201d she cried out.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take any more, as he quickly shed his own shorts and then poised over her. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he gasped, as he looked down into her flushed face.</p><p>He thrust his tongue into her mouth at the same time he finally gave them both what they wanted and submerged his engorged shaft deep within her folds. She jerked her hips upward, wanting him even deeper. He gladly obliged her unspoken request.</p><p>He could no longer hold anything back. He pushed into her fast and she matched him thrust for thrust. She was panting and then suddenly cried out. He felt her pulsing around him and he lost all control. He pushed in one final time and then spilled deep inside of her.</p><p>With his last ounce of energy he turned onto his back, while pulling her up close to his side. He wasn\u2019t letting her pull away from him again. He\u2019d broken his rule of making the first move but she hadn\u2019t offered any form of resistance and they weren\u2019t taking steps back.</p><p>Neither of them said anything but after their breathing returned to normal, he felt her trying to pull away. He just tightened his arms around her. \u201cGo back to sleep Jessica,\u201d he commanded. She gave up the fight soon drifting off. He quickly followed her.</p><p>Chapter five</p><p>Jessica woke up and turned over. Ouch! She was sore. She sat up, realizing she was alone in the very large bed. Her hands flew to her face as she replayed the previous night in her mind. She and Alex had made love, not only once but twice. The first time, when she\u2019d woken up plastered against him and the second time, after feeding Jacob and laying back down.</p><p>There\u2019d been no hesitation on her part. He\u2019d reached for her and she\u2019d fallen instantly into his arms. How was she supposed to keep her distance from the man when the second he touched her she melted? She was relieved and saddened at the same time to find herself alone.</p><p>She quickly got up and checked on Jacob, who fortunately was still sleeping. She had time to shower and work out her stiff muscles. She hadn\u2019t done anything that physical in too long to remember.</p><p>She finally dressed, gathered Jacob and headed down the stairs. \u201cGood morning, Mrs. Anderson. I hope you slept well,\u201d Tina greeted her.</p><p>\u201cI did. Thank you,\u201d she automatically replied.</p><p>\u201cMr. Anderson asked me to tell you he had to run into the office today and would be gone all afternoon. He said the new nanny would arrive around eight,\u201d she said, before placing Jessica\u2019s breakfast before her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jessica fed Jacob while eating her own breakfast, then settled down in the den to wait for Julia, her new nanny.</p><p>Julia arrived early and got her room organized in no time. Jessica, Julia and Jacob spent the day together around the house. Jessica couldn\u2019t find any faults with Julia and had to admit it was very nice to have an extra pair of hands to help with the baby. She eventually even went to spend some time in the garden, without fear of not hearing Jacob.</p><p>Jessica decided if her marriage ended up not working she was going to keep Julia with her. She was enjoying the help and could see Julia loved children.</p><p>As Jessica sat in the garden, she tried to figure out how she really felt about her husband. They did enjoy each other\u2019s company, she was definitely attracted to him and they shared a child together. He was unlike any man she\u2019d ever known before. She would have to do some real soul searching, because she was terrified to let her guard down and let him in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessica didn\u2019t know how long she sat in the garden daydreaming but soon Julia was walking towards her with a fussy Jacob in her arms. \u201cYour son\u2019s ready for his lunch,\u201d Julia said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I didn\u2019t realize how long I\u2019d been sitting out here,\u201d Jessica quickly said. She immediately got up and headed towards Julia and her son.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve some time to yourself. Don\u2019t feel guilty for enjoying a few moments of peace in an otherwise hectic day,\u201d Julia chastised her gently. \u201cYour son can wait long enough for you to clean up,\u201d she added.</p><p>Jessica looked down at her hands and noticed they were covered with dirt. She looked up and smiled sheepishly. \u201cI guess I should wash my hands before taking him,\u201d she replied. She bent down and kissed Jacob\u2019s soft head before they headed inside.</p> <p>Jessica cleaned up and took Jacob. It was really nice to have Julia\u2019s help but holding her son was the most relaxing thing in the world to her.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your last family,\u201d Jessica asked once her son was settled down and eating.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a wonderful family. I worked for them for twenty years. I was there for the births of the youngest two children and their oldest child Justin was only a year old. Their mom was a lot like you. She wanted to do everything on her own but found having some help gave her the extra energy to be a great mother,\u201d Julia replied.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have someone around. I\u2019ve always thought doing things on my own was the only way to do something but my mother\u2019s told me many times it\u2019s okay to ask for help,\u201d Jessica said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine my life any other way. I wasn\u2019t blessed to have a family of my own. I do appreciate you sharing the joy of being there for Jacob with me,\u201d she said with sincerity.</p> <p>Jessica knew they were going to have a great relationship. \u201cWe\u2019re really glad you\u2019ve come into our lives,\u201d she said.</p><p>They both chatted while Jacob ate, then Jessica excused herself and took him to bed. She was comfortable enough in her home to take another nap, knowing everything would be okay. She felt at peace in her home.</p><p>The next couple of months flew by in a blur. With Julia there to help Jessica she was able to focus on her writing and felt like she was accomplishing something. She still spent most of her time home but when she ran errands or worked on her book she didn\u2019t feel like Jacob was being neglected.</p><p>Her nights were regularly filled with passion. She and Alex didn\u2019t spend much time together during the days, with him gone for work. But when they climbed into bed together it was like they were there for the first time, every time. It was magical and she knew if it were to end suddenly her world would be destroyed. She was too dependent on Alex\u2019s attention.</p><p>Jessica started to become restless around the big house. There didn\u2019t seem to be a lot for her to do. When she received a call from an old college friend, informing her about a part-time job at the local newspaper for a writer she jumped at the chance. She\u2019d already been weaning Jacob and it would be great to get out of the house.</p><p>She was so afraid of losing her sense of self and she could work part-time without guilt. Her child was in more than capable hands and the staff ran the house. It would be good for her to do something simply about her.</p> <p>\u201cNow Jessica, I want to remind you this isn\u2019t exciting news. It will be covering city meetings and school events but it\u2019s still an important part of the paper.\u201d Jessica was in Marcia\u2019s office, her editor, discussing her new job details.</p><p>\u201cI understand Marcia. I\u2019m not out to change the world. It\u2019ll be nice to be writing and get out of the house,\u201d Jessica reassured her new boss.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re on the same page. Your first assignment is at the city hall. They have a meeting this afternoon at two. Do a short article on the topics of discussion and of any issues that arise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there. Thank you for this opportunity Marcia. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to admit I was a little surprised you wanted to work a job like this. You have a very impressive resume and could work for any major publication you wanted,\u201d Marcia stated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a full time mother now and the kind of careers I\u2019m qualified for require sixty plus hours a week. I\u2019m not willing to be away from my son too much. I plan on eventually writing novels but would like to stay out in the workforce as well.\u201d Many people assumed just because Jessica had access to money beyond what most people ever dreamed of having she\u2019d be a spoiled heiress. It never took her long to prove herself though and she knew she would gain the respect of her co-workers at the paper.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re happy to have you join our team. The article is due by noon tomorrow. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Marcia went back to work and Jessica headed outside to her car. She had about an hour to kill before the city hall meeting so she headed to the mall for a smoothie and some light shopping.</p><p>The meeting was a bore, as she knew it would be. It was difficult but she managed to place a good spin on the article and her editor was more than happy with her work. She found it amusing she was taking so much pride in her small job but she felt useful and good about herself. It was the first time in a while she felt needed.</p> <p>She drove home, still feeling great. When she stepped through the doors, she could smell the wonderful aroma of dinner cooking and hear Jacob giggling somewhere. She followed the sound.</p><p>She stepped into the den and found Alex on his back, with Jacob balancing on his knees like he was flying through the air. He let out another giggle. Jacob spotted his mom and started wiggling to be let down.</p><p>Alex looked up to see what caught his son\u2019s attention, then gave Jessica one of his killer smiles. Setting Jacob on the floor, the baby crawled as fast as his chubby legs would allow to his mother.</p><p>Jessica scooped him up in her arms. \u201cHow\u2019s my handsome young man?\u201d she spoke to her son, as she nuzzled his neck, causing more giggles.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing great. How was your first day at work?\u201d Alex seemed genuinely interested, which surprised Jessica.</p><p>\u201cIt was actually great. I know it\u2019s not a big time paper and my name isn\u2019t going to go up in lights or anything but I like the people down there and it\u2019s nice to be working again,\u201d Jessica said, almost defensively.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not judging you,\u201d Alex said, while holding his hands out. \u201cSeriously, I really want to know how your day went and what you did,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Jessica eyed him suspiciously for a few moments and then decided to tell him about her article and the people she\u2019d met.</p><p>\u201cI need to go in tomorrow for a couple of hours and then I thought I would go to the salon. I haven\u2019t had my hair or nails done since before Jacob was born and it would feel heavenly,\u201d she said with a little guilt for leaving her son while she pampered herself.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to take some time for yourself. You have nothing to feel guilty about. Jacob is fine. He knows you love him and he won\u2019t be scarred for life because his mother got her nails done. Stop being so hard on yourself,\u201d he stated, as if he could read her mind.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re right but I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t be one of those mothers who left her child in someone else\u2019s care while she ran all over the place. It feels wrong, especially with him still being a baby.\u201d She headed over to the bar and poured herself a half glass of wine.</p><p>Jacob was happily playing with some of his toys on the floor. Jessica and Alex sat on the couch and watched him amuse himself.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a great mother. If you take care of your own need as well as his, you\u2019ll always be a great mother. Women who sacrifice everything for their husbands or children end up resentful. You don\u2019t want that to happen do you?\u201d</p><p>Jessica looked at Alex, slightly puzzled. This was one of the most real conversations they\u2019d ever had. It was nice to come home and voice her concerns with the man she loved. Her world stopped as she realized she really did love Alex. She\u2019d tried to avoid it but she loved her time with him. She loved how he was with their son and she loved what he stood for.</p><p>She was so afraid her face would somehow show her newfound feelings so she stood up, under the pretense of checking a toy Jacob was playing with. She composed her features, then turned back towards Alex.</p><p>\u201cThanks Alex. I needed to hear that. I\u2019ll take a little me time and not feel guilty about it. I\u2019m going to wash up and change for dinner.\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to answer her. She quickly slipped from the room and headed to her shower, where she could wash her worries away.</p><p>By the time Jessica came back downstairs, dinner was ready and Jacob was seated in his high chair. He was happily stuffing creamed food into his own mouth. More food was on him than in him but he enjoyed himself so it was okay.</p><p>\u201cI hope you had a great first day at work,\u201d Julia said.</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice. How did the day go with Jacob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was his usual happy self. He took only a short nap this afternoon though, so I think he\u2019ll be ready for bed early tonight. He\u2019s almost finished with his supper so I\u2019ll take him up for a bath while you eat.\u201d Jessica was happy they\u2019d found Julia. She knew Julia loved Jacob as much as Alex and she did. She was certainly an invaluable member of their family now.</p><p>\u201cThank you Julia. I know I don\u2019t say it enough but I\u2019m grateful you\u2019re a part of our family. I could\u2019ve never spent the afternoon away from my son if I wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure he was in capable hands.\u201d Jessica got up and gave Julia a hug.</p><p>\u201cThe honor\u2019s all mine. You have a beautiful family and I\u2019m very happy to be a part of it,\u201d Julia said before heading off to bathe Jacob.</p><p>Alex and Jessica finished their supper in an almost uncomfortable silence. When they were talking about Jacob or making love they were in perfect harmony. In any other situation the silence was awkward.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going to my brother\u2019s ranch tomorrow,\u201d Alex finally broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. You haven\u2019t taken a day off in a while,\u201d Jessica replied.</p><p>\u201cHe has a roundup that needs done and then we\u2019re all going to meet for a barbeque afterwards,\u201d he continued.</p><p>Jessica was nervous. She hadn\u2019t been around his family since the wedding. Joseph and Katherine came over regularly to play with Jacob and Alex had taken the baby over to his siblings a couple of times but there hadn\u2019t been any family gatherings. She was nervous to face them all as a group.</p><p>It was especially nerve wracking to be around Lucas and Amy. They were so obviously in love with each other and she herself felt like such a fraud. Jessica knew each day she spent with Alex she fell a little bit more in love but she also knew he didn\u2019t return the feelings. If they didn\u2019t have Jacob together they wouldn\u2019t have a marriage at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to attend tomorrow but if you want to have your parents stop by and grab Jacob that would be okay,\u201d she tried to say nonchalantly.</p><p>Alex stared at her for a few moments before responding. \u201cLook Jessica, I understand my family can be overwhelming and you\u2019re still trying to get used to everything but they would be hurt if you didn\u2019t come. Your parents will even be there. Can you please just forget about everything else going on for one day and come enjoy yourself?\u201d he asked, while never breaking eye contact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessica knew once again she\u2019d been defeated. Her parents would drag her there anyway if they saw she didn\u2019t show up. She could try and fake an illness but her mother knew her more than anyone. She would take one look at her and it would be over.</p><p>\u201cI just had to work on an article I was writing but I\u2019ll do it the next day,\u201d she finally conceded, hoping he bought her story. She didn\u2019t want him to know she was really just a coward.</p><p>Alex continued to look at her for a while before he nodded. She knew he didn\u2019t buy her story but thankfully he was man enough to not call her on her lies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to head up to bed and read for a while,\u201d Jessica finally said, having lost all of her appetite.</p> <p>\u201cI have some work to finish up. I\u2019ll join you in a while,\u201d Alex replied before getting up and heading out of the room.</p><p>Jessica wanted to talk to him about her feelings and try and make the marriage about more than just their son and sex but she didn\u2019t know how to bridge the gap. She was afraid if she brought anything real up, he would run from her.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cSurprised you could climb out of the newlywed bed long enough to join us,\u201d Mark took a shot at his brother, while punching his arm. \u201cHeck we didn\u2019t see Lucas for at least six months,\u201d he continued.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re seeing me now. Amy\u2019s about to have the baby,\u201d Lucas said, while looking down at his phone for the hundredth time.</p> <p>\u201cTrust me; your ringer is working just fine. If anything happens you will be the first one who knows about it,\u201d Mark laughed.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. I worry so much about her being so pregnant. I know she\u2019s with mom and dad but man, it\u2019s hard to be away from her right now,\u201d he smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cThank the lord I\u2019m still single. You two are just a little too gushy for my tastes,\u201d Mark sighed before jumping the fence.</p><p>Lucas and Alex were right behind him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be next you know. We both thought we would hold out and look at us. Not only are we married but fathers as well. Your day is coming,\u201d Alex grinned at his younger brother.</p><p>\u201cNo way man, I\u2019m a confirmed bachelor and that\u2019s how I would like to keep it. I have my hands full with all of these animals. I don\u2019t have any time for women or babies in my life,\u201d he added.</p><p>Lucas and Alex just looked at each other and smiled. They knew their younger brother would fall and it would be their pleasure to watch it happen. \u201cI thought you said there was some work to be done,\u201d Alex goaded him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be begging me to stop by the end of the day. I bet you fall over and embarrass yourself in front of your bride,\u201d he said with a hopeful wink.</p><p>\u201cBring it on little brother,\u201d Alex replied, accepting the challenge.</p><p>If an outsider was looking at the trio of men they\u2019d think they belonged on a ranch. No one would be able to tell Lucas and Alex both worked in offices and flew around the world on Jets. Mark, of course was a full time rancher but it was by choice. He\u2019d decided early on in his life office work wasn\u2019t what he wanted to do.</p><p>Their father, Joseph loved his boys intensely and supported their decisions. When Mark decided to ranch he supported him one hundred percent.</p><p>Lucas, Alex and Mark looked dashing in their worn Stetson hats and boots and painted on jeans. They rode the horses around like rodeo champions and literally stopped women in their tracks when they went by.</p><p>The brothers spent the afternoon bringing the cattle in and branding them. Mid afternoon they stopped by the lake for some lunch and basked in the summer heat.</p><p>\u201cAny time you boys are ready to trade in your suits and run the ranch with me, you know you\u2019re welcome,\u201d Mark said with a cheeky grin.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love the land and helping you out here is a little slice of heaven but it wouldn\u2019t take long before the appeal of travel and a nice clean suit would be calling my name,\u201d Alex said.</p> <p>\u201cYou know dad would lasso you up for trying to take me away from the office. He\u2019s retired and doesn\u2019t want to go back,\u201d Lucas added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying...\u201d Mark left the sentence unfinished.</p><p>Lucas and Alex both sighed in unison.</p><p>\u201cOk last one in has to do the grilling,\u201d Mark said while stripping down to his boxers in record time and diving into the lake.</p><p>\u201cAh crap,\u201d Alex yelled while trying to yank his boots off. He glanced over and saw Lucas had the lead. Lucas dived in about two seconds before he did.</p><p>\u201cI think you guys cheated again,\u201d Alex laughed. \u201cYou know you just want me grilling because I\u2019m the best one at it. You guys always burn that beautiful Angus Meat,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cHey, when you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right,\u201d Mark said before sending a slew of water right into Alex\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cNow the war\u2019s on,\u201d Alex stated before a massive water fight erupted. When the brothers all got together, it was like they were teenagers once again. They had a bond stronger than most siblings and all three of them would take a bullet for one another. They knew they were so close due to being raised by phenomenal parents.</p><p>\u201cOk, ok, I call a truce,\u201d Lucas finally said, while dragging himself out of the water. Mark and Alex followed. The three of them settled down on the soft grass and enjoyed the sounds of nature all around them.</p><p>\u201cSo how are things with your wife and amazing son going?\u201d Lucas asked Alex.</p><p>\u201cThings are great. Jacob is growing like a weed. I can\u2019t believe how important he is to me. I can even imagine having about ten more of him running around,\u201d Alex said with true fondness for his son.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Jessica?\u201d Mark asked.</p><p>Alex hesitated for a moment. He didn\u2019t really know how to describe his relationship with his wife. He knew if he told his brothers it was none of their business they\u2019d back off and leave him alone but it would feel good to talk about his conflicted emotions.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s really complicated. We married because basically I didn\u2019t give her any choice. She had my son, which she kept from me,\u201d he said with an edge to his voice. He was still unhappy she hadn\u2019t told him about the pregnancy. \u201cSomewhere along the line though, in the last few months I\u2019ve found I\u2019m excited to see her. I look forward to coming home, knowing she\u2019ll be there.\u201d He didn\u2019t add anything else. He didn\u2019t want to even mention the Love word.</p><p>Neither brother spoke for a few moments. They seemed to understand he was trying to figure things out in his own head.</p><p>\u201cYou know things didn\u2019t start out so well for Amy and me either, little brother,\u201d Lucas finally said. \u201cI fought hard against my attraction to her. I, in no way wanted to be in a relationship. On the other hand I\u2019d never wanted a woman like I wanted her. She would walk into the room and I was on instant alert. I tried to tell myself it was just some weird hormonal imbalance but even though I was fighting it I knew it was a losing battle,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cEveryone can see you and Amy were meant to be together. Things may have started out rocky for you but you\u2019re disgustingly in love now. There isn\u2019t a woman out there who could love you like she does. It\u2019s the only reason she puts up with your ugly hide,\u201d Alex finished and punched Lucas in the arm.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it sounds to me as if the both of you are just love sick. Thank the Lord it will never happen to me,\u201d Mark added with a cocky smile.</p><p>Lucas and Alex looked at each other and smiled. They knew their brother would go down kicking and screaming but they knew he would go down. It would be immensely pleasurable for them both to watch.</p><p>\u201cI may not be in love like Lucas but it\u2019s nice to have something to come home too,\u201d Alex said. He felt a twinge of pain as he said the words. He figured he was lying to himself, saying he wasn\u2019t in love but it was better than the alternative of being vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think you\u2019re fooling yourself little bro. I\u2019ve seen the way you look at Jessica. It\u2019s more than just lust. You look at her the way I look at Amy. The sooner you accept that fact and enjoy being married, the sooner you can stop hurting all the time. Man, when I finally just let myself open up, my whole world changed. Seriously, if something were to ever happen to Amy, I couldn\u2019t survive it,\u201d Lucas finished.</p><p>He then pulled his phone out for the millionth and one time to see if he\u2019d missed a call from his very pregnant wife.</p><p>\u201cGive it a break bro; your wife will call you if she goes into labor. Your phone will not miraculously miss a call and if one or either of these things did happen, someone would come running to find you and rush you into the hospital,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know but wait until you\u2019re the one in my position. There\u2019s nothing greater than your wife giving birth. It\u2019s amazing and beautiful and at the same time terrifying. I\u2019d gladly take her every pain if I could. It kills me to just stand by, only holding her hand. But then there\u2019s this beautiful child resting in her arms and she\u2019s smiling at you with this radiant joy showing on her face. There\u2019s nothing like it in the world,\u201d Lucas finished.</p><p>Alex sat there quietly, listening to Lucas talk. He was jealous of his brother, which was very unusual. He wished so much he could\u2019ve been there for the birth of his son. He was still angry Jessica had taken that from him. He should\u2019ve been there for his son\u2019s first cry. He should\u2019ve been there to be able to protect them both.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like heartache I don\u2019t want to deal with,\u201d Mark laughed. The joke brought Alex back to the present. He laughed but it was forced. Thankfully his brothers let it go.</p><p>\u201cWell, we better get back to work. Everyone should be here in a couple of hours. We don\u2019t want them to realize we play out here more than we work,\u201d Lucas said. He got up and headed over to get back on his horse.</p><p>They all finished up with the cows and headed into the barn to brush down their horses.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you boys quit playing around and got back here,\u201d came the booming voice of their father, Joseph.</p><p>\u201cHey Dad,\u201d all three boys said in unison and then went up and gave their father a big hug.</p><p>\u201cYou have a house full of people all waiting on you three,\u201d he said good naturedly.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s because they all know I\u2019m doing the grilling,\u201d Alex smiled.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s because they know your mama and your beautiful brides have been busy making everything else,\u201d Joseph answered back.</p><p>\u201cMmm, I hope Mom made her famous chicken salad,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cWell you should know your mom still spoils you boys rotten. I try and tell her you\u2019re all grown up and don\u2019t need her spoiling but she won\u2019t listen to me,\u201d Joseph said. The three boys looked at each other and rolled their eyes. They knew their father was the biggest softie of them all.</p><p>\u201cSure Dad, Mom\u2019s the only one who spoils us,\u201d Mark said, while smacking his dad on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s head on in so we can get some of Mom\u2019s salad and Alex can get those steaks on the grill,\u201d he continued. His mouth was starting to water just thinking about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you lose again,\u201d Joseph turned his attention towards Alex.</p><p>\u201cAh Dad, you know they cheated because I\u2019m the only one who can cook worth a lick,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>They had a laugh and walked comfortably up towards the house. They could hear people laughing and talking, even from the barn. Mark loved having his family and friends at the ranch. He was a lucky man. There was no need for a woman in his life, he thought. He was surprised by the slight pang that struck his gut. He decided to push it right out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cSo Mark, when are you gonna settle down like your brothers and give your poor mama some grandbabies. You know she\u2019s not getting any younger and she cries at night from the heartbreak of a son intent on living alone,\u201d Joseph said.</p> <p>Mark sighed before he spoke. \u201cYou know none of that\u2019s true, Dad. You\u2019re the one who wants all those grandbabies running around. I think Lucas and Alex are doing just fine at giving you a bunch of little Andersons,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if Mom heard you say she was old, you\u2019d be in for a world of hurt,\u201d he added with a wicked grin.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t talk back boy. Of course it\u2019s your mama who\u2019s worried about you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cAnd if you dare tell your mom what I said, you\u2019ll be the one in a world of hurt,\u201d he threatened.</p><p>\u201cOk Dad, you can let her know I\u2019m staying a confirmed bachelor. There are far too many hearts that would be broken if I decided to tie the knot. I don\u2019t want to be responsible for all that heartbreak,\u201d he said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cYou know he\u2019ll fall just like we did,\u201d Lucas added his two cents.</p><p>\u201cYou stay out of this Lucas,\u201d Mark said with a bit of a grumble.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it bro, married life isn\u2019t all that bad and its way cool to be a father. Speaking of fatherhood, where\u2019s my boy?\u201d Alex asked his dad.</p><p>\u201cHe was playing with his cousin when I headed down here,\u201d Joseph smiled fondly, while speaking about his grandkids.</p><p>Alex and Lucas both picked up their pace so they could see their kids. Mark shook his head, thinking his brothers had it bad. At least he liked their wives and those kids were pretty dang adorable.</p><p>Jessica stalled at the sight of Alex walking around the corner of the house. The man was stunning every day but in skin tight wranglers, boots and a worn hat he was the sexiest thing she\u2019d every laid eyes on.</p><p>As if Alex felt her eyes on him, he looked up and they stared across the yard at each other. She forgot there was anyone else even there as he neared her. He smelled like a hard working man and she was practically drooling.</p><p>Without saying a word, he pulled her into his arms and crushed her lips to his. Her arms wrapped around his neck to pull him even closer. Her heart was racing and fireworks were shooting off, all over her body. His hands started rubbing up and down her back and she was ready to start taking off his clothes.</p> <p>\u201cUh um, Alex those steaks should get started,\u201d Mark interrupted them.</p><p>Jessica jumped back like lightening had just struck them both. She\u2019d been so focused on Alex she\u2019d forgotten anyone else was there. She could feel her face turning many dark shades of red.</p><p>Alex looked at Mark and growled. Jessica did a double take at her husband. She couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d actually growled. Her mouth was gaping open in shock.</p><p>Mark laughed and pulled Alex away. \u201cCome on bro, you have all night to be with your beautiful bride,\u201d he said. Mark turned and gave Jessica a wink, which made her blush even more.</p><p>\u201cWoo girl, that was enough steam I\u2019m surprised my water didn\u2019t burst right then.\u201d Amy was laughing as she walked up to Jessica.</p><p>Unbelievably Jessica\u2019s blush deepened even more. \u201cI\u2019m a bit mortified right now,\u201d she managed to say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever be embarrassed for desiring your husband. He\u2019s a sexy, vibrant man and you guys are newlyweds. I can\u2019t wait for this beautiful baby to make his entrance into the world so I can rub up against my husband again. Right now he has to try and make his way around my whale like body,\u201d she smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful pregnant woman I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201d Jessica said, meaning what she spoke.</p> <p>\u201cThank you but I feel like I not only swallowed one watermelon but about ten of them.\u201d She spoke the words, while rubbing her stomach. There was real pride in her eyes and voice. She may have been complaining about her baby bump but she obviously already loved her unborn child.</p><p>\u201cI know I did a lot of moaning and groaning in the last month of my pregnancy but all the bloating and aching was well worth it when I held my baby boy in my arms. I don\u2019t get to hold him much when this family is around though. He\u2019s definitely a celebrity here,\u201d she finished with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same way with Jasmine. They adore her. I love how much this family values each of their own. I also love how much they love the adopted family members like you and I. Once you\u2019re a part of this family, it\u2019s for life,\u201d Amy added with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so nervous around everyone though,\u201d Jessica admitted. \u201cYou and Lucas obviously love each other with such a deep passion. Alex was forced to marry me because of Jacob,\u201d she said with a sad quiver at those last words.</p><p>Amy immediately wrapped an arm around Jessica. \u201cI love Lucas heart and soul but trust me when I say it didn\u2019t start out strong. We seemed to have an instant dislike for each other. I wasn\u2019t willing to marry him. I felt how you do. I felt like I was trapping him. I\u2019d wanted a baby so badly for so long and I\u2019d wanted to belong to a real family and I felt like I\u2019d somehow made the pregnancy happen. We were both fighting our attraction like crazy. I thought I wasn\u2019t good enough for him.\u201d She said with tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI was so, so very wrong. I want to really emphasize that point to you. We fought our attraction, which was stupid, because I see that now as wasted time. We love each other and it only grows stronger. This family loves me and my daughter with a passion as well. They love you too and so do I. You will one day wake up and wonder what took you so long to see how much you\u2019re meant to be together,\u201d she finished.</p><p>The two women finished by giving each other a hug, even though it was a little bit difficult with Amy\u2019s belly protruding between the two of them. Amy giggled, \u201cSee I told you this thing is always in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I repeat you\u2019re absolutely beautiful,\u201d Jessica said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my pregnant wife. How are you feeling? Shouldn\u2019t you be sitting down? Can I get you anything?\u201d Lucas walked up, fired a bunch of questions at his wife and then placed his arm around her like he was going to pick her up and carry her off to bed.</p><p>Amy laughed at her worried husband and reached up to place her hand on his face. It was such an intimate moment Jessica felt like an intruder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, hunny. You need to quit worrying so much. I told you if there was anything at all wrong, you\u2019d be the first to know,\u201d she reassured him. Lucas then bent down and kissed Amy with such a tender passion, it brought tears to Jessica\u2019s eyes. She wanted that same love with Alex. She knew her heart was going to get broken into a million pieces because she fell for him more each day.</p><p>They finally broke apart and now Amy\u2019s face was the one flushed instead of Jessica\u2019s. \u201cNow you go and help your brother cook while I waddle over to that comfy lounge chair and continue chatting with my favorite sister-in-law. No wait, scratch that, just my sister,\u201d she finished smiling fondly at Jessica.</p><p>The words choked Jessica up even more. She was grateful she\u2019d decided to put her worries aside and join the family gathering. Her son was getting all kinds of love and she knew she and Amy were going to be true friends. She needed one in her life.</p><p>\u201cI would listen to her Lucas; pregnant women tend to change moods faster than a speeding bullet.\u201d Both girls giggled and then Amy took Jessica\u2019s arm and they walked towards the lounge chairs and warm fire.</p><p>\u201cBut Alex lost fair and square, which means I can hang with you,\u201d Lucas said, sounding like a little boy. Amy gave him a look and he conceded defeat.</p><p>Lucas walked up to his brother, offering his help. \u201cHa, looks like you were annoying your wife as much as you were annoying us today with all your worrying,\u201d Alex goaded him.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t annoying her, she was just having girl talk with your wife about you,\u201d Lucas said with a wicked smile.</p><p>Alex\u2019s head whipped around, as his confident smirk fell. \u201cWhat were they saying?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know, its girl talk. No boys allowed in that conversation,\u201d he said, liking having the upper hand again. His smirk faded though as he sought out his wife. He wanted to take her home and keep her safe. He was worried with all the walking she was doing. He wouldn\u2019t survive it if something happened to her or the baby.</p><p>\u201cYeah kinda sucks being over here huh?\u201d Alex mocked him good naturedly as he noticed his brother staring at his wife.</p><p>\u201cI love her so much Alex. I really can\u2019t remember life without her,\u201d he said with real passion. \u201cI know you love Jessica and I know you\u2019re confused right now and I know things aren\u2019t perfect but they didn\u2019t start perfect for us either. I promise you it will get better,\u201d he finished with sincerity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good. Why don\u2019t you quit talking like a girl and help me grill,\u201d Alex said, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I don\u2019t want you running to Amy and telling her you did all the work. Then I\u2019ll get in trouble,\u201d he said as he grabbed some tongs and started flipping the juicy steaks over. The smell reminded him he hadn\u2019t eaten in hours and he\u2019d worked his butt off all day. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done before I die of hunger. Man, Mark worked us hard today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. I think little brother was trying to kill us,\u201d Alex laughed.</p><p>\u201cDid I just hear you tough boys whining?\u201d Mark suddenly popped through the doorway.</p><p>\u201cNot whining Mark, just discussing how sore I\u2019m going to be tomorrow,\u201d Alex said with a chuckle. \u201cI guess I should try and get out here a little more often. I\u2019m getting a little too used to that desk,\u201d He finished.</p><p>\u201cHey, speak for yourself. I chase around an almost two year old daily. Let me tell you it\u2019s a workout that rivals rustling up cows.\u201d Lucas immediately looked around until he spotted his daughter. She was, of course, being coddled by her grandfather.</p><p>\u201cNotice how Dad\u2019s always telling us we need to give Mom grandkids but he\u2019s the one who\u2019s hogging them,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cI know. Dad\u2019s all bark and no bite. We all know he wants those grandkids for himself but man, have you noticed how good he looks. I\u2019m really glad he has those two babies in his life. It\u2019s brought a whole new youthfulness to his entire appearance,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>Mark stood beside his brothers feeling a bit left out. He hadn\u2019t felt that way since they were all young kids and they would sometimes run off ahead of him. He\u2019d been too young to keep up but they\u2019d eventually always come back for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell I think I\u2019ll just enjoy being a favorite uncle,\u201d he finally spoke up. As if Jasmine had heard him, she looked up from where she was with her grandpa and spotted her dad and uncles. She started toddling over towards them as fast as her chubby little legs would carry her.</p><p>\u201cUnca Mar, unca Mar,\u201d she demanded as she held out her arms towards him. Her words were getting so much better but Mark wished she would keep the sweet baby talk forever.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s my beautiful princess,\u201d he asked, while he swung her up into his arms and blew raspberries on her tummy.</p><p>\u201cHungy,\u201d she said and pointed to the steaks. \u201cThat\u2019s Uncle\u2019s good girl. Let\u2019s get you some dinner. You can be my beautiful date. I will most definitely have the prettiest one here,\u201d he said with total adoration in his eyes and voice.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jasmine replied as she clapped her hands together, then grabbed Mark\u2019s face and gave him a sloppy kiss, which he loved.</p><p>\u201cLooks like this is ready,\u201d Alex said. He motioned for the staff to come and gather up everything and stepped down with his brothers to be with the rest of their family.</p><p>They all had an amazing dinner. Everyone was enjoying themselves. It was hard to get two words in with all the laughter and stories being passed around the large picnic tables set up on the massive lawn.</p><p>Jessica finally allowed herself to relax and found she having a great time. She loved to watch Alex interact with his brothers. They all acted like little boys, as they were trying to best each other and telling many embarrassing stories about one another.</p><p>\u201c...Seriously, you should\u2019ve seen him standing there with his pants around his ankles...\u201d Jessica heard Mark saying as she tuned back into the conversation. She\u2019d have to ask Alex about that later. It sounded like she\u2019d missed out on a great story.</p> <p>\u201cOkay everyone ignore my brother. I think he\u2019s had one too many if you know what I mean,\u201d Alex said, as he motioned in the air like he was tipping a bottle up to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just upset because you\u2019re usually the one who ends up at the losing end of all these childhood stories,\u201d Mark said as he lightly punched his brother in the arm.</p><p>Alex shrugged at the good natured teasing. He turned towards Jessica and gave her a smile. \u201cI like the stories,\u201d she said somewhat shyly.</p><p>Alex couldn\u2019t help himself. He leaned down towards his wife and brushed his lips against hers in a soft kiss. It brought tears to her eyes and she quickly looked away and forced a bite of food down.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked her quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p> <p>He continued to stare at her for a moment, making her want to squirm in her chair. Then someone else asked him a question, which gave her some time to compose herself. She was praying no one had noticed. She missed the knowing look on Joseph\u2019s face. He was feeling pretty smug as he watched the love growing between his son and daughter-in-law.</p><p>Jacob gave a little giggle from his high chair, sitting right next to his grandpa.</p><p>\u201cThey are pretty silly, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Joseph said to his grandson, which made everyone laugh.</p><p>Suddenly there was a commotion at the other end of the table. Lucas was jumping up and looking around in all directions, like danger was approaching and he was going to take on an entire army.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you jumping all around for boy?\u201d Joseph asked with concern.</p><p>Lucas looked at his father with panic in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s time Dad. Amy\u2019s water just broke,\u201d he said like he was a lost little boy.</p><p>\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you say so,\u201d Joseph stated with some panic in his own voice.</p><p>\u201cBoys, would you please calm down. Child birth is natural and nothing to panic about,\u201d Katherine said to her husband and son. \u201cHow far apart are your contractions?\u201d she asked Amy.</p> <p>\u201cAbout two minutes,\u201d Amy said, a little bit short of breath.</p><p>\u201cWell then, we\u2019d better get you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lucas almost shouted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive her Lucas. You\u2019re far too freaked out to be driving anybody,\u201d Katherine told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay Mom.\u201d He would never argue with his mother. He\u2019d been raised too well to do something that foolish.</p><p>\u201cThank you to everyone who came out and spent this evening with us. You\u2019re all so special to us,\u201d Katherine stated to the large group consisting of family and friends. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep you all updated on this beautiful new addition to our family and please keep Amy, Lucas and Jasmine in your prayers as they bring this new baby into the world,\u201d she finished.</p><p>Everyone applauded, then got up to leave so the family could be together during their special time.</p><p>\u201cMark, you ride to the hospital with Alex and Jessica. The babies are getting tired and Julia can take them both back to Alex\u2019s house if that\u2019s okay with you,\u201d Joseph said. Everyone nodded without even thinking of questioning him.</p><p>\u201cWell good, that\u2019s settled, let\u2019s get going and wait for the newest member of our family to come into this world,\u201d Joseph said excitedly.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy,\u201d Lucas came bursting through the hospital doors. He was immediately engulfed in hugs and many congratulations from his family.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad, Amy wants you both,\u201d he said through the tears of joy rolling down his cheeks. Neither of them had to be told twice. They were immediately through the doors and off towards Amy and their newest grandson.</p><p>Jessica watched the happiness all around her with a mixture of happiness for her newfound sister and sadness for what she wanted in her life so badly. The thought of having another child, one that was planned with a husband who loved her was something she was afraid to even wish for.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of the family can come see Amy and the baby now,\u201d a nurse said from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see my new nephew,\u201d Mark replied, before being the first one through the doorway.</p><p>The rest of the family followed. \u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful Amy,\u201d Jessica said.</p><p>\u201cYou may get a chance to hold him if his grandpa ever lets him go,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI have to make sure the little tyke is doing okay,\u201d Joseph said, not even bothering to look up from his grandson.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to name him?\u201d Alex asked.</p><p>\u201cWe decided on Isaiah Allen after my grandfather,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a real fine name son,\u201d Joseph said, with some tears of his own in his eyes. He then quickly turned away while he tried to control his emotions.</p><p>\u201cAh Dad, we all know you\u2019re a big softie. You don\u2019t have to pretend to be some tough old guy,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cNow boy, you\u2019re not too old for me to take you out behind the woodshed,\u201d Joseph said but there was obviously no oomph behind his words.</p><p>\u201cHey now, there\u2019s no bickering in my recovery room,\u201d Amy said. She really was happy to have her family there to share in their joy.</p><p>The baby started to fuss and Joseph handed him over to his mother with much reluctance.</p><p>\u201cAmy needs to feed him now. Why don\u2019t you all go home and get some rest and then come over tomorrow for Isaiah\u2019s homecoming,\u201d Lucas asked.</p><p>Everyone said their goodbye\u2019s and headed out. Jessica was filled with many different emotions. She was truly happy for her sister-in-law but envious as well. She wanted a big family so badly. She\u2019d been raised as an only child and even though her parents were phenomenal, she got very lonely at times. She didn\u2019t want her son to grow up without siblings. Maybe Alex wouldn\u2019t mind having another child. Even if their marriage wasn\u2019t one about love, they would stay together for the sake of Jacob, so why not have a sibling for him?</p><p>Alex took her hand as they walked towards their vehicle. \u201cHe sure was cute. I wish so much I would\u2019ve been there for Jacob when he was born,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jessica automatically tensed up, thinking they were going to have another fight and really too tired for it. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that. I thought I was doing the right thing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. She was so surprised; she didn\u2019t know what else to say. He didn\u2019t sound angry, or even hurt. He just sounded a little bit down. \u201cI hadn\u2019t exactly led a life that would\u2019ve made you believe I would be ready or willing to settle down. I understand now that I know you better. You thought you were doing the right thing in not telling me. I hope you realize I would\u2019ve been there for you the moment you found out. I don\u2019t shrink from my responsibilities,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Even though Alex was saying he would\u2019ve been there for her, Jessica\u2019s heart was feeling like it would break in two. He thought of her as just another one of his responsibilities and not his wife. He was doing the right thing as he\u2019d been taught to do. She wanted him to be with her because he loved her, not because he\u2019d messed up and now had to pay the price.</p><p>\u201cI know you would\u2019ve done the right thing from the beginning,\u201d she said in what she hoped was a normal tone of voice.</p><p>Jessica pulled her hand from his as they approached their vehicle. She couldn\u2019t maintain the contact any longer. It was killing her slowly. Suddenly he pushed her up against the car and kissed her deeply. All heartbreak washed away as his hands rubbed down her sides, then reached up to hold her head as he deepened the kiss.</p><p>He was making her insides melt and she was forgetting about everything around her when he finally broke away. \u201cLet\u2019s go on vacation. We didn\u2019t get a honeymoon and I have a trip over to the Virgin Islands this week. Come with me. Jacob will be fine for a few days. I will hurry to get you home, I promise,\u201d he finished.</p><p>He was looking deep into her eyes and she found she couldn\u2019t say no. She couldn\u2019t even find her voice. She finally nodded her head yes.</p><p>He lifted her up into his arms, gave her another quick kiss and then helped her into the car. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a great time. I have meetings in the mornings but then we\u2019ll have all day to play on the water and dance all night,\u201d he said, sounding like an excited teenager getting ready for summer.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a very nice time,\u201d she finally managed to say.</p><p>Jessica was nervous. She\u2019d never liked large crowds and prayed his dancing wasn\u2019t going to be in the middle of a crowded club.</p><p>\u201cPack up tomorrow. We leave in two days. We can let Julia know tonight and you can get all your time in with Jacob so you won\u2019t feel guilty.\u201d</p><p>She looked ahead at the road. She hated he knew her so well. She did feel guilty about leaving their son at home but at the same time if she ever hoped to make her marriage a real one, this was the time to do it. They were going to be in a romantic hotel completely alone. She had a few days to let her defenses down and see if it made a difference.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds great. I know Jacob will be fine but I\u2019m glad I\u2019ll have tomorrow.\u201d she admitted.</p><p>They rode in a comfortable silence the rest of the way home. She was planning what needed to get done before they left. There was much to do.</p><p>Alex was extremely happy Jessica was going with him. He wanted to be with her. He felt better when she was near. He didn\u2019t want to even admit to himself how much she mattered to him but it was impossible to push away all his feelings. He told himself he would simply take it one day at a time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe have to leave, Jessica,\u201d Alex said for the tenth time.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, it\u2019s just so hard,\u201d Jessica said as she kissed Jacob for about the hundredth time. \u201cI love you sweetie. Mama will be home in a few days. Julia is going to take really good care of you, I promise,\u201d she said.</p><p>They headed to the awaiting limo and Jessica smiled as she climbed inside. He had champagne chilling, a vase with two dozen roses, chocolates and a wrapped package all sitting there.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you a honeymoon, so even though this is a business trip, I plan on doing minimal business and giving you a romantic honeymoon the rest of the time. I wanted to start things out right,\u201d he said with a little shrug.</p><p>Jessica was so choked up at his thoughtfulness she couldn\u2019t speak for several moments. \u201cThank you,\u201d she finally managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cHere, open your gift,\u201d he said with a sparkle in his eyes.</p><p>She took the package from him slowly unwrapping the gift. When she opened the jewelry box, she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the exquisite ruby necklace inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTurn around and I\u2019ll put it on for you. I thought it would match your favorite dress and knew I had to get it for you,\u201d he said while clasping it. His fingers trailed down her neck, when he was finished latching the necklace and she shivered in need.</p><p>He slowly turned her around and kissed her with such tenderness, she felt like her whole body was going to melt. She loved the unending passion they had but this tenderness he was showing was sure to be her complete undoing.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he whispered to her, as he trailed his lips down the side of her neck. Her body shivered again and she reached for him, needing his lips on hers.</p><p>Jessica hadn\u2019t realized how much time passed when the voice came over the intercom, \u201cwe will be arriving at the airport in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>She jumped like she\u2019d been caught necking with her boyfriend behind the bleachers, then chuckled. There was nothing wrong with kissing your husband in the back of a limo. \u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to come on the trip,\u201d Alex said as he helped her out of the car.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d she replied, really meaning it.</p> <p>\u201cI promise not to work too much,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI will hold you to that promise.\u201d</p><p>They boarded the company jet, which was luxurious even beyond what she was used to. She sat down and the perky flight attendant served them drinks and let them know dinner would be served once they were in the air. Jessica looked forward to a few days of really getting to know the man she\u2019d married.</p><p>After they ate, her exhaustion finally took over and she slept the rest of the flight.</p><p>\u201cWake up, were here,\u201d Alex\u2019s voice stirred her from her sleep.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d she managed to mumble.</p><p>\u201cYou slept the whole trip,\u201d he said with a little laugh. \u201cI\u2019m glad because now you will have a lot of energy for our night out.\u201d</p><p>They stepped out of the jet and she breathed in the beauty of the island. It was so warm, with a nice breeze gently blowing. They climbed in the waiting car.</p> <p>\u201cI have some business to take care of right away. Why don\u2019t you get settled in the room and then relax on the beach for a while. Be ready by six tonight for dinner and dancing. Wear a dress,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great. I haven\u2019t laid on the beach in forever. Seattle isn\u2019t exactly lounging around weather,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>Alex left her at the hotel, where she quickly changed clothing and headed to the semi-private beach. There were several people from the hotel but it was mostly couples and everyone seemed to be enjoying the beauty around them.</p><p>She jumped into the warm ocean and swam around until she was tired, then found a covered lounge area and pulled out her favorite romance book. She was reading about the hero and heroine and thinking her life was so much better, when she drifted off into another nap.</p><p>When Jessica woke, she glanced quickly at her watch and gave a little squeak as she realized it was four-thirty. She gathered her things quickly and headed back to the room to get ready for her date.</p><p>There was a message waiting, asking her to meet Alex in the bar, as he was running a little bit late. She jumped in the shower and then took her time getting ready, making sure she looked perfect.</p><p>She\u2019d purchased a dress she normally would\u2019ve never worn but she\u2019d wanted to let loose on vacation. It dipped far lower in front than she\u2019d ever worn before, showing a generous amount of her cleavage. The back of the dress dipped down to the small of her back and the hem reached mid-thigh. It hugged her hips tightly then the skirt flared out in a flirty style.</p><p>She\u2019d even purchased new undergarments for the outfit and was wearing sexy panties and a garter belt. She wanted to incite passion in her husband and with the outfit she was wearing, she was hoping he had an uncomfortable evening.</p><p>As Jessica looked in the full length mirror at her image, she was a little shocked by her own boldness. She turned to look from all angles and smiled to herself. She almost didn\u2019t recognize the woman staring back at her. Since she\u2019d become a mother, she\u2019d taken too little time with her own self. She wore sweats far too often and hardly ever applied make-up. Alex hadn\u2019t seemed to mind but she liked feeling like a woman and vowed to take more time to pamper herself from then on.</p><p>Jessica made her way to the hotel lobby and stepped into the bar. She spotted Alex right away. He was so handsome, he took her breath away. When he turned towards her and his glance slid by and then whipped back to her, she smiled with triumph.</p><p>Alex just about slid out of his seat when he spotted his wife. She was always beautiful but he\u2019d never seen her in anything like the dress she was wearing. He could feel the instant reaction his body was having, making his pants far too tight. He got up and walked towards her, almost as if he was in a trance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most ravishing woman I have ever met,\u201d he said to her, before pulling her into his arms and taking her lips with his.</p><p>\u201cThank you, you are looking very dashing yourself,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to fight off every man in this place,\u201d he said while glaring slightly at a guy who was practically drooling over her.</p><p>He wrapped his arm possessively around her and led her to the outside restaurant. They had a wonderful dinner, filled with laughter and excellent food. Soon he was calling a cab and leading her to a different part of town.</p><p>They stepped up to a place she was shocked he would even know about. She could hear the music from the street and the neighborhood didn\u2019t look to be the safest.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this is a safe spot?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Alex threw back his head and laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t worry my love, I\u2019ll protect you from any dangers,\u201d he said while leading her through the open doorway.</p><p>Jessica caught her breath at his words. Did he know how badly she wanted his love? All thoughts fled as they stepped through the doorway.</p><p>The club was very dimly lit, making it hard to see anything. A steamy song was loudly playing and people were mashed together all throughout the club. Most of the couples looked more like they were about to drop to the floor and have sex, than like they were dancing.</p><p>Her eyes were drawn to the couple in front of them. Her stomach tightened and she told herself she should look away. The moment seemed so intimate between the two people, she felt like a peeping tom.</p><p>The woman\u2019s head was thrown back and her lips were open, in what Jessica was sure was a moan escaping. The man had her plastered against him, with his hands running up and down her back and thighs, while his mouth was moving over her neck and breasts. Jessica finally managed to turn away and felt like running out of the club.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d Alex whispered in her ear. His voice sounded deep and husky, which made her stomach tighten even more. She nodded, knowing it was impossible for any words to escape her at that moment.</p><p>Alex pulled her into his arms, reminding her of their first dance together. He\u2019d been so flirty and cocky. Dancing in his arms at that moment she couldn\u2019t understand why she would\u2019ve ever felt the need to fight him in any way.</p><p>\u201cI want you so badly. You look amazing in this dress. I could take you right here,\u201d he whispered to her. A shiver passed all the way down her spine and she could feel the heat, where she wanted his touch so badly.</p><p>Words still couldn\u2019t escape Jessica\u2019s tightened throat. Alex kissed her with passion and heat making her forget the room around them. His lips moved from her lips to her neck and down the plunging neckline of her dress.</p><p>His hands stroked up and down her back, getting lower and lower with each pass he made. They were barely moving to the music. He slowly started walking her backwards until she felt the hardness of a wall behind her back.</p><p>His hands were now running along the side of her body, touching the sides of her aching breasts and tender stomach. He began moving them down her hips until he finally found the bottom of her dress. They ran up under the hem and cupped her bare bottom. She let out a moan of pleasure as he caressed her skin.</p><p>He pulled her roughly into his obvious arousal and his lips once again connected with hers. It was pure seduction and she didn\u2019t care they were in the middle of a club. She was ready for him to take her.</p><p>She lifted her hands up, to begin unbuttoning his shirt, when he suddenly stopped and pulled back. \u201cWe have to get out of here now,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. Without saying anymore, he grabbed her hand and led her from the club. He pulled her quickly down the walk and hailed them a cab.</p><p>Jessica was beginning to think she\u2019d done something wrong, because he was sitting several feet away from her in the cab and not uttering a word. They reached the hotel and he helped her out. He then pulled her around the building and they walked out onto the beach and took a secluded path.</p><p>She was just working up the courage to ask him what was wrong when he pulled her back into his arms and kissed her again with all the force he\u2019d shown her at the club. She forgot all about her worries as her arms came up around his neck and she gave him full access.</p><p>Alex threw his jacket down on the ground and lowered her gently to the grass covered mound in the middle of a deserted trail. The silver moon cast a soft glow, providing only enough light to barely see him, leaving everything around him in shadows. He stripped her dress off in one movement, leaving her exposed and vulnerable.</p><p>He was awed by the sight she made, wearing only a piece of black lace barely hiding her from him, the garter and red heals. She was bathed in the moonlight, giving her a surreal look. He wanted nothing more than to bury himself deep inside of her but he wasn\u2019t a selfish lover and he would make sure of her pleasure before his own.</p><p>He quickly stripped away his clothes and then brought their bodies back into intimate contact. He took her lips in his again, making her cry out her pleasure, as his hands explored every inch of her skin. His lips caressed her neck and the tops of her breasts.</p><p>She could barely breathe, the pressure was so great. She wanted to cry out her love for him but held back, barely. When his lips finally took her hardened peak into his mouth and he sucked her aching nipple, her whole back arched off the ground. When he gently nipped the sensitized skin she almost came undone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged. She didn\u2019t know whether she was begging him to continue on or to join them.</p><p>He kissed his way down her smooth stomach, making it tighten even more. His tongue dipped into her belly button and she moaned at the intense sensations he was bringing her. He finally moved to kiss and caress her thighs, making them open to his administering. When his mouth finally touched her burning heat, she thought she would explode.</p><p>Her body wouldn\u2019t stay still. He deepened the intimate kiss and she could feel her body begging for release. When he dipped his fingers inside her, she couldn\u2019t hold back any longer. She cried out and finally let go, waves of pleasure washing over her.</p><p>He slowly kissed his way back up her body, starting to stir her heat once again. She didn\u2019t understand how he could make her want him so much. He\u2019d just pleasured her beyond what any one person should ever receive and she greedily wanted more.</p> <p>He brought his lips back to hers and the taste of their passion on his tongue fully brought the fire back to her body. \u201cPlease,\u201d she begged again. She wanted him deep inside of her.</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d he asked, knowing the answer.</p><p>\u201cPlease love me,\u201d she gasped. She silently added to love her both emotionally and physically.</p><p>He said nothing more, just slipped inside her heat in one sure thrust. He threw back his head and moaned out loud. He didn\u2019t move, as if he was trying to calm himself. She jerked her hips up, needing him to move inside of her.</p><p>That little movement was all it took. He grabbed her backside and thrust hard in and out of her. His lips latched back onto hers and he loved her with a passion that should have set the grass around them on fire.</p> <p>She felt the heat building up inside her again, even stronger than before and suddenly her body jerked with a pleasure so intense, it bordered on pain. Her tightening heat around him sent him over the edge and with a final thrust deep inside her, he let go and cried out in his own pleasure.</p><p>His body was covered in a fine sheen of sweat, glistening in the moonlight. He collapsed on top of her but quickly shifted them both, bringing her on top. They were still connected together, which felt right.</p><p>He was rubbing her naked back and she was so content, her guard was down and she finally whispered the words she\u2019d wanted to say for so long, \u201cI love you, Alex.\u201d</p><p>She felt him stiffen, which told her more than words ever could have. He didn\u2019t want her love. He wanted the passion and he even wanted companionship but he didn\u2019t want love.</p><p>She was close to tears as he pulled their bodies apart and started to get dressed. \u201cWe better get out of here before some unsuspecting tourist happens to walk by,\u201d he said in an almost cold tone.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s heart was breaking into a million pieces. What had started as the perfect day was ending with devastation. The hurt was unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced before. She loved him so much. Why couldn\u2019t he feel the same way about her? She thought she felt love when he held her in his arms. It seemed like he loved her but maybe to him sex and love were two completely different things.</p> <p>She quickly dressed herself and then walked slowly back to the hotel with Alex. It was like walking with a stranger, he was so distant. \u201cI know I told you I wouldn\u2019t be working much but something came up and I will be busy all day tomorrow,\u201d he said as they entered the suite.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Jessica replied.</p><p>\u201cI need to finish some work tonight,\u201d he said as he headed to the office. She didn\u2019t even reply. She just headed off to take a shower and then to bed, where she could cry herself to sleep.</p><p>The next two days and nights of her honeymoon were miserable. Alex was gone all day, returning too late for them to go out. She spent her time on the beach and shopping all alone. They did make love in the evenings but it was different. She could feel he was holding something back and when they were done, he turned away from her, seeming to fall asleep quickly.</p><p>Jessica was relieved on the third day when he said everything was finished up and they could head back home. She didn\u2019t know what to expect when they got back. She was sure things would go back to her barely seeing him and her love for him aching to be set free. She had to make a decision of what to do, sooner rather than later.</p><p>\u201cI was a compete ass,\u201d Alex said to his older brother Lucas. \u201cI knew she was falling in love with me but selfishly I wanted her to keep it to herself and not bring it out in the open. I don\u2019t have the time or energy for that kind of relationship but I\u2019ve really shut her out and don\u2019t know how to make things go back to the way they were,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so wrong with your wife loving you and you her?\u201d Lucas asked, sounding stunned.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with it when you have a relationship like you and Amy. Jessica and I have an understanding. We have Jacob to think about and if we get all these emotions mixed up then we\u2019re jeopardizing the whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>He knew even as he said it, how wrong it sounded. They had a child together, so how could love mess that up? Well, besides his parents and now Lucas and Amy, Alex hadn\u2019t seen a lot of good marriages. They all ended in divorce with bitter custody battles. Alex figured if he kept love out of the equation, he\u2019d never have to worry about divorce. The thought of Jessica and Jacob not being there with him every day tore his heart to pieces.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re in a whole hell of a lot of denial, little brother. You have an amazing wife, who obviously loves you and you know what? I think it\u2019s pretty obvious you love her too. Why not quit fighting it and just enjoy being with your family,\u201d Lucas stated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever. I have to get going. I\u2019ll be gone all week and I\u2019m sure everything will be normal when I return home,\u201d he said, praying it was true.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d Lucas said before Alex departed.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing? You look like you don\u2019t feel too well,\u201d Amy said. She and Jessica met for a girl\u2019s day out. They were sitting at the salon having their nails done when Amy questioned her.</p><p>\u201cI have a nasty flu that\u2019s been going around but I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she replied, hoping to feel better sooner rather than later.</p><p>\u201cIf you need to rest up we can reschedule our day out,\u201d Amy offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve been looking forward to this all week. Alex has been gone for a few days and even before he left I\u2019ve hardly saw him. I need some good old fashioned girl talk. How is everything going with you?\u201d she asked. She was desperately trying to push away the queasiness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing so much better. Can you believe Isaiah is already two weeks old? He\u2019s such a great baby too. He actually lets me get four hours of sleep in a row. I\u2019m really glad I hired the nanny, too. It\u2019s been such a great help having her around. Jasmine absolutely adores her and I\u2019ve been able to get plenty of naps in. Plus I feel safe stepping out for the afternoon with you,\u201d she said with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cI know how quickly time flies. I can\u2019t believe Jacob is almost a year old. I want to go back to the beginning, though the full nights rest part is pretty nice,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI think I would be happy having about ten more kids. Don\u2019t look at me so horrified. I love being a mother and Lucas is about the best husband in the world. Plus, I think Joseph would think he\u2019d died and gone to heaven having that many grandkids surrounding him. I really love this family so much,\u201d she gushed.</p><p>Jessica sat for a few moments without saying anything. She wanted more kids so badly but if things didn\u2019t change with her husband she didn\u2019t see that happening. He was content just having Jacob. She wondered what he would say if she told him she wanted to have another baby. She didn\u2019t really want to think about his reaction. He most likely would shut her out more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to have a large family. I love my parents beyond anything but it was lonely growing up as an only child. I\u2019ve never wanted that for Jacob,\u201d Jessica finally responded.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys planning on another little one anytime soon?\u201d she asked with a wink. \u201cThe trying part is so much fun,\u201d she added with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about it,\u201d was all Jessica said. She was having a really hard time fighting off the tears. She wasn\u2019t normally so emotional but she figured being so lonely lately was most likely contributing to that.</p><p>\u201cAlex adores Jacob so much. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d like to have a few more running around. Talk to him about it. You know grandpa is going to be expecting another one soon,\u201d Amy said.</p><p>\u201cJoseph is about the greatest man there is. I can\u2019t believe how lucky Jacob is to have such an amazing grandfather. Plus Katherine is a dream grandmother. I love the quilt she made for Jacob. She comes over and visits all the time. I really regret them not getting those first three months with their grandson,\u201d Jessica said with some sadness.</p><p>\u201cThey completely understand though. You were unsure about the relationship and thought you were doing the right thing. What matters most is you\u2019re all together now. I know things can be really tough sometimes but hang in there,\u201d Amy said.</p><p>Jessica didn\u2019t want to talk about the tension between her and Alex, so she decided it was a great time to change the subject. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to try the new Thai place a few blocks away. Do you want to go there for lunch?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Amy took the hint and they discussed lunch and the kids and just about everything else except husbands. Jessica felt herself relaxing and really enjoyed the rest of the day. She really did have an amazing sister-in-law. By the time they got back to the house, she was more relaxed than she\u2019d been before her impromptu honeymoon.</p><p>She would have to wait and see how things would work out. She couldn\u2019t leave Alex. She loved him too much and he was an amazing father, so maybe she would simply have to hold her heartache in and live with things the way they were. That thought wasn\u2019t very appealing but what else could she do?</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The months slowly passed since the honeymoon. Alex was finally staying home much more often and they were back to making love almost nightly and to an outsider everything would look normal. Everything would look like they were a perfect family.</p><p>Jessica hadn\u2019t repeated her vows of love to her husband and he\u2019d started to relax. She didn\u2019t want to break the truce they\u2019d established.</p><p>Jacob was turning a year old that afternoon and they had a huge party planned, with both of their families there. She loved when the family got together, more than anything. She couldn\u2019t believe there was ever a time she\u2019d feared them.</p><p>Jessica stole Isaiah away every chance she could get but when Joseph was around it was more difficult. He would hold all three of his grandkids on his knees and was like a papa bear when someone tried to take one of them away.</p><p>The kids adored their grandfather just as much. The second he would walk in the door Jasmine and Jacob would run to him with their arms out and the baby would coo at him. Joseph was in baby heaven.</p><p>Jessica finished getting ready for the party, knowing Julia was dressing Jacob at the same time. There was a sweet bond between the Julia and Jacob. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMama, someone is looking for you,\u201d Alex\u2019s voice came around the corner about a second before he stepped through the doorway.</p><p>Jessica gulped in her handsome husband and son. \u201cMama, hold,\u201d Jacob demanded of her, as he reached out to her from his father\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my sweet boy. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re a year old today. Is it your birthday?\u201d she asked him before tickling his belly.</p><p>\u201cMy day,\u201d he said in his sweet baby voice.</p> <p>\u201cYes it is and you have grandpa and grandma and your aunts and uncles coming to see you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGampa, yeah,\u201d he said and started looking around.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here yet,\u201d she said with a smile. She loved how bonded her son was with both his grandfathers.</p><p>\u201cI wan gampa,\u201d he demanded with a little scowl between his brows, reminding her so much of her husband.</p><p>\u201cI like how he knows what he wants and isn\u2019t afraid to demand it,\u201d Alex stated proudly. \u201cCome on Jacob, I think I hear grandpa in the hall,\u201d he said as Jacob eagerly leapt back into his father\u2019s arms.</p> <p>Alex laughed and bent down kissing her quickly before leaving the room. She slowly followed her two favorite men.</p><p>\u201cAbout time you brought my grandson down here. I have been waiting about five minutes now,\u201d came Joseph\u2019s booming voice.</p><p>Alex chuckled, as Jacob practically flew into his grandpa\u2019s arms.</p><p>Jacob patted Joseph\u2019s face to get his attention, \u201cmy day gampa,\u201d he said with a cheeky smile.</p><p>\u201cYes it is your birthday Jacob. Let\u2019s go sneak into some candy,\u201d he whispered, although everyone in the room could hear him.</p><p>\u201cDad, don\u2019t give him a bunch of junk food or he\u2019ll get cranky,\u201d Alex said, although he knew his words were falling on deaf ears. As he figured, Joseph acted like he hadn\u2019t heard a word. Jessica had to laugh. When Joseph wanted to spoil his grandkids, there was nothing anyone could do to stop him.</p> <p>\u201cI forgot to tell you how beautiful you look today,\u201d Alex said to her and then took her into his arms and kissed her softly. She immediately melted as he deepened the kiss. He was getting ready to take her back upstairs.</p><p>They\u2019d been together for almost a year and she still had the ability to tighten his stomach. He wanted her every second of the day. She was beautiful and passionate.</p><p>Hell, he thought the party could wait on them. \u201cYou guys want to go upstairs for a while. I will cover for you,\u201d said the laughing voice of Mark.</p><p>Jessica jumped out of Alex\u2019s arms and could feel her face getting hot. She hated how easily she blushed. She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been caught necking in the hallway like she was some undersexed teenager.</p><p>Alex glared at his brother. \u201cYou could\u2019ve just gone out back with the rest of the family and not so rudely interrupted,\u201d he said far too meanly in Jessica\u2019s opinion. He did look even sexier when he was in a temper, which he clearly was.</p><p>\u201cOh quit being a stick in the mud, you have all night to continue kissing. Now be a good brother and get me a beer,\u201d he said and practically dragged Alex from the room.</p><p>Jessica took a few moments to compose herself before heading in the direction of the party. She stared at the large group of family and friends on her back deck and smiled. Her son was so lucky to have so many people who adored him.</p><p>Whenever she began to think she couldn\u2019t stay another day in the house with a man who didn\u2019t love her, she would be at a family gathering and her resolve would deepen. She loved this group of people so much and the thought of not having them in her life was unbearable.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t like Alex was cruel to her in any way. He was simply honest, saying he couldn\u2019t love her. He wanted her which was obvious. Their passion burned greatly. She was coming to believe he just didn\u2019t want to be in love with anyone and it wasn\u2019t personal.</p><p>Jessica snapped back to reality and looked around the crowded yard once again. Her smile was genuine as she spotted her beautiful child and her niece and nephew.</p><p>Jasmine and Jacob were in the swings, with grandpa pushing them both. \u201cHigher gampa,\u201d Jasmine yelled and then squealed with delight when grandpa accommodated her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing dear?\u201d Katherine asked, as she walked up to Jessica.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great, thanks Mom,\u201d she replied. Katherine was such a quiet person, sometimes she got engulfed from her huge force of a husband. All the kids knew grandma was the real source of magic in the family though.</p><p>She had an amazing heart and more love to give than any other person Jessica knew. Jessica was glad her family meshed so well with the Anderson family. They\u2019d all become one instead of two.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Jacob is a year old already. The time simply goes by far too quickly, in my opinion,\u201d Katherine said with some sadness.</p><p>\u201cI agree, it seems like just yesterday I was bringing him home from the hospital. He will be off to college before I have a chance to blink,\u201d she said with some panic.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen quite that quickly but it sure seems like it. I\u2019m grateful my boys decided to live close to home. When Mark graduated and moved out a piece of my heart broke. Letting go of any of your children is hard but the youngest one is the final piece and it feels like a piece of you leaves with them. I\u2019m also grateful they\u2019re finally marrying and giving me grandkids. It helps ease the heartache a little,\u201d she added.</p><p>Jessica looked guiltily down at her feet for a moment. She knew her father and Alex\u2019s parents were hoping to have many more grandkids but Jessica was so afraid to even bring it up with Alex. She was afraid he would say no and she would have to finally accept they couldn\u2019t stay together.</p><p>\u201cThree grandkids in just under three years is pretty good,\u201d Jessica said instead.</p><p>\u201cYes, they really are a blessing. Joseph has been mumbling now about Mark settling down. I\u2019ve told him time and again to leave the boy alone. He\u2019ll have kids when he\u2019s ready for it but you know Joseph, he\u2019s stubborn. He thinks he fools me but I\u2019ve been married to the man for far too many years for him to get away with much,\u201d she said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s definitely stubborn. His sons and grandsons have inherited that trait,\u201d Jessica said with a fond smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to steal that new grandson of mine before Joseph gets his hands on him,\u201d Katherine said. She kissed Jessica\u2019s cheek and then headed over to Amy, who had just walked around the corner.</p><p>Amy walked over to Jessica, now that her arms were empty. \u201cI barely get to see my kids when we are around this group,\u201d Amy complained but the twinkle in her eyes took away any bite in the words.</p><p>\u201cI know how you feel,\u201d Jessica agreed with her sister-in-law.</p><p>\u201cI really couldn\u2019t imagine being a part of one of those families who never speak to one another. It breaks my heart now to think about that,\u201d Amy said with true knowledge.</p><p>Jessica knew Amy had grown up with an addicted mother until the day she went into the foster care system. She\u2019d worked her way through college and then met Lucas while working for the Anderson Corporation.</p><p>Having a close family was something Jessica had always taken for granted, whereas Amy had never known such a loving group of people. Jessica reached over and gave Amy a big hug. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you are my sister Amy. I\u2019m glad you were able to find the family you were meant to have,\u201d Jessica said.</p><p>Amy had to wipe away a few tears, \u201cnow look what you made me do,\u201d she said with a sniffle. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to have you, too,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Amy,\u201d Lucas came running up, as if he had radar built in. He was gathering Amy in his arms while scoping the yard to make sure his children and the rest of the family were all okay. He couldn\u2019t seem to find any danger and that led to his brow furrowing even more.</p><p>\u201cEverything is just perfect, that\u2019s why I\u2019m crying,\u201d she said with a sniffle.</p><p>Lucas looked at her like she\u2019d lost her mind for a moment and that set both women off in a round of giggles. \u201cLucas, you have to understand we cry when we are happy and sad. It\u2019s just one of those mysterious things about women,\u201d Jessica finally managed to get out between giggles.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay,\u201d Alex asked as he looked from his brother to the two laughing women. Lucas gave him a look that seemed to say, you figure them out, which sent the girls off on another round of laughter. They were both holding their stomachs and tears were streaming down their faces they were laughing so hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop talking or I\u2019m going to get a major cramp,\u201d Amy finally managed to get out between bits of laughter.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Jessica said.</p><p>Both guys threw up their hands and by mutual consent edged away from the girls. \u201cWe better go finish the grilling,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll help you,\u201d Alex eagerly took the cue and they fled.</p><p>After a few minutes Jessica and Amy were able to quit laughing. \u201cI love doing that to him,\u201d Amy said mischievously.</p><p>\u201cThat was quite fun,\u201d Jessica agreed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get something to drink. All this laughter is great but man my stomach hurts now,\u201d Amy said. \u201cPlus I have got to get off these feet; I swear they are still swollen and acting like I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a drink myself. I\u2019ve been fighting the flu and having a hard time keeping things down, so don\u2019t bring the baby to close to me. I would never forgive myself if I got my nephew sick,\u201d Jessica said.</p><p>The girls joined the rest of the party, stealing two very comfortable chairs for themselves. The food was excellent and Jessica was relaxed and calm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to sing happy birthday,\u201d Alex shouted above the voices as he came walking out of the house with a large chocolate cake and a single candle burning in the center.</p><p>Jacob blew out his candle with the help of his father and then clapped his hands with everyone else. Everybody roared with laughter when Jacob stuck his little hand into the cake and smeared it all over himself, saying yummy over and over again.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s eyes filled with tears as she watched Alex stick his face into the cake with their son. She loved how much they were bonded. \u201cDaddy likes cake too,\u201d Jacob squealed and then giggled.</p><p>\u201cSo does grandpa,\u201d Joseph said and took a big handful for himself.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass on the cake,\u201d Jessica said with affection, while staring at her chocolate covered men.</p><p>\u201cI will second that,\u201d Amy added.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing,\u201d Alex said. Before she could stop him, Alex took a chocolate smeared finger and rubbed it down her nose. She stood there in shock for a moment and then fast as lightening scooped up a small piece of the cake and chucked it at her husband.</p><p>She saw the light of mischief come into his eyes and decided it was a great time to retreat. She took off running but Alex caught her in no time. He gently tackled her to the ground and rubbed his chocolate covered face against hers.</p><p>Jessica was laughing so hard she could barely speak. \u201cOkay, okay I call truce,\u201d she finally managed to get out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are no truces in a food war,\u201d he said and rubbed against her some more. Suddenly he seemed to realize he was stretched out on top of her. He had her hands pinned above her head and she was completely at his mercy.</p><p>Alex forgot their yard was filled with people. No one else seemed visible to him except his beautiful, chocolate covered wife. He bent his head down and instead of rubbing more chocolate on her, his lips met hers and he kissed her with an intenseness that wiped away all laughter.</p><p>Alex released her hands and they immediately wrapped around his neck so she could pull him tighter to her body.</p><p>\u201cUm guys, I hate to interrupt you twice in one evening but this is a G-rated party,\u201d came the laughing voice of Mark once again.</p> <p>Alex pulled apart from her reluctantly and growled at his brother. Jessica looked at her husband in shock. She then looked around her in embarrassment and was extremely grateful no one was paying the least bit of attention to them.</p><p>Alex finally got up and pulled Jessica to her feet. \u201cThis party can end anytime now,\u201d he said, with promise of completion to come. \u201cAs a matter of fact, no one would probably even notice if we disappeared for a little while,\u201d he offered her.</p><p>She was getting ready to agree with him and sneak off upstairs when Joseph walked up to them.</p><p>\u201cNow that Jacob is a year old, when are you planning on giving him a sibling?\u201d Joseph asked Alex. \u201cYou know a boy needs to have some younger sibling to harass,\u201d he added and looked pointedly at Mark.</p><p>Jessica was the only one who noticed the shutters lock into place on her husband\u2019s face. Her heart broke a little bit more. He\u2019d gone from passionate lover, to closed off in about two seconds.</p> <p>\u201cDad, you already have three grandkids, quit being so greedy,\u201d Alex finally managed to say in a stilted voice.</p><p>\u201cNow son, you\u2019re not getting any younger. You better get working on things,\u201d Joseph continued, not noticing the sudden tension in his son. He winked at Alex and Jessica both, which made her blush again.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, just enjoy the cake,\u201d Alex said and then quickly changed the subject. Jessica had her answer she hadn\u2019t wanted to face. Her husband definitely didn\u2019t plan on having more children with her. How could a night so full of promise just a moment ago have suddenly gone so dark?</p><p>The party went on even after Jacob finally succumbed to his exhaustion and went to bed. Jessica loved to watch the brothers laugh together and act like they were teenagers. She was putting on a fake mask the rest of the night though, because all she really wanted to do was crawl in bed and have herself a really good cry. She and Amy sat back and visited while the rest of the guests slowly started to depart.</p><p>She managed to maintain her composure the rest of the night. She could go curl up in bed and think about what she was going to do about her future really soon. She knew she couldn\u2019t stay in the marriage if Alex didn\u2019t want to be a real family but she didn\u2019t want to think about it.</p><p>\u201cWe need to have another girl day, how about Friday?\u201d Amy asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d Jessica said before hugging her goodbye. She was almost sad to see the rest of the guests go but at the same time she really needed to be alone for a while.</p><p>\u201cI have some work to finish up. I\u2019ll be up later,\u201d Alex said before quickly turning and heading to his office.</p><p>Jessica climbed the stairs to their room and curled up in bed, where she cried herself to sleep. Alex must\u2019ve stayed in the office far later than normal because he wasn\u2019t there when she finally managed to fall into an exhausted sleep.</p><p>The next month passed by with more and more heartache for Jessica. Alex was home more often than not but if Jacob wasn\u2019t there as a buffer between them he would lock himself up in his office.</p><p>They did a lot of family activities together but he seemed to make sure they were never alone otherwise. They still made love in the night but even that had changed. It was still amazing and he was still a fantastic lover but he no longer held her tightly afterwards.</p><p>She knew she was going to have to confront him but she also knew how the conversation would go.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could go out on the lake this weekend, if you\u2019d like,\u201d Alex asked her at dinner one night.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d Jessica said with enthusiasm.</p> <p>\u201cI think Jacob will like the boat. There\u2019s nothing like the wind blowing through your hair as you navigate the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your son doesn\u2019t have much hair,\u201d she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very true. The sun will be good for all of us. It\u2019s supposed to be a really nice weekend and those are few and far between,\u201d he said with a genuine smile.</p><p>She hated she responded to him so quickly when he gave her the least bit of himself.</p><p>The weekend came and Jacob had a cold so they went out on the boat alone. She was afraid he would cancel but he was in a good mood so they left the house early in the morning.</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d do some crabbing while we\u2019re out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great. Amy said she and Lucas did that a couple weeks ago and had a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I got the idea from Lucas. He enjoyed himself,\u201d he told her.</p><p>The drive to the coast was gorgeous and they talked more than they had in months. For the first time in too long to remember Jessica was feeling some hope.</p><p>They arrived at the marina and boarded the boat and she was having a great time. Once the temperature warmed up, she stripped down to her bikini and lay out on the deck. The hot sun and cool breeze felt phenomenal against her skin. Her worries seemed to float away on the gentle breeze.</p><p>It was taking every bit of Alex\u2019s will power not to find a secluded cove to park the boat and ravish his wife. She had no idea the power she held over him.</p><p>As he steered the boat further into the water, his eyes were continually drawn back to Jessica, lying out there on the deck, just a few short feet away from him.</p><p>Since the night she\u2019d told him she loved him he\u2019d backed off dramatically. He knew he was hurting her but he also knew she would be better off in the long run if he gave her some space. She needed to realize she wasn\u2019t in love with him. He knew she was more in love with the idea of love and marriage than the actual reality of it.</p><p>His dad had freaked him out when he\u2019d brought up having more children. What scared him the most was how much he wanted her to become pregnant again. He could visualize a bunch of miniature Jessica\u2019s running through the house. He couldn\u2019t figure out what he was doing anymore.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so warm out here,\u201d Jessica said, while turning towards him suddenly. \u201cCan we stop somewhere so I can take a swim?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI can see a cove over here,\u201d he said and steered the boat towards the secluded beach. He was clenching his teeth because everything in him told him he needed to head back towards the docks.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s so perfect,\u201d she gasped at the little piece of heaven of a beach. As soon as he got the anchor down on the boat she dove into the water. He was impressed with her form. He was feeling way to hot himself so he stripped down and jumped in after her.</p><p>They both swam around in a comfortable silence for a while, when suddenly she cried out. Alex immediately swam towards her and sucked in his breath as he noticed blood coming to the surface of the water.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d he fired off at her, while at the same time he was pulling her close and leading her back to the boat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she cried out. \u201cIt\u2019s my leg. I think I cut it on something,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>Alex couldn\u2019t see anything, so he towed her back to the boat, praying it was nothing to bad. He lifted her up into his arms and climbed aboard.</p><p>He laid her gently down and then went and got the first aid kit. When he returned, he was shocked by the amount of blood.</p><p>\u201cIt looks worse than it is,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI was looking at it and it looks like I scratched it on a rock or something. It just seems to be bleeding a lot. If you clean it out and wrap it I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst take this Advil, then I\u2019ll start cleaning and assess for myself how bad it is,\u201d he said in his commanding voice.</p><p>Even though Jessica was hurting, she had to smile at the command in his voice. She loved it when he got all determined and acted like the world should bow to his feet.</p><p>She flinched when he cleaned the wound with the alcohol but she was right, it wasn\u2019t as bad as he thought it was. He was surprised by the amount of blood that had escaped the small wound.</p><p>The Advil kicked in and the pain subsided greatly once the wound was cleaned up. \u201cI\u2019m fine now,\u201d she reassured him.</p><p>\u201cWe can head on home,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. As a matter of fact I\u2019m feeling very hungry,\u201d she said. She really didn\u2019t want to head back to the house right away, knowing he would disappear into his office.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t handle being all alone with her any longer, so he headed the boat back towards the shore and placed a call to his brother. If they had company for dinner, he wouldn\u2019t have to try and answer the questions he saw coming from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cJessica wake up, we are back at the docks. I called Lucas and he and Amy are going to meet us in a half hour at this great seafood place,\u201d Alex said while gently shaking Jessica awake.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she stuttered, struggling to wake up. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry; I didn\u2019t even realize I was so tired. I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep on you,\u201d she said when she finally woke up fully.</p><p>\u201cHey, no problem. I really enjoy the water and having the soothing silence,\u201d he responded before securing the boat.</p><p>Jessica felt a little bit like she\u2019d been slapped. She felt he was basically telling her he\u2019d enjoyed his day much more because she wasn\u2019t there to talk in his ear. Well fine, she thought, if he wanted silence, then silence would be what he got.</p><p>She quickly got dressed and limped up the dock with him toward their car. She kept silent the entire ride to the restaurant and he said nothing as well. Jessica was wishing to get home so the awkward afternoon could end.</p><p>\u201cJessica, I\u2019m so glad you guys called,\u201d Amy came walking up and put her arm through Jessica\u2019s, while chattering away. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to get out of the house for some adult conversation. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I adore my kids but they do lack certain communication skills,\u201d she finished with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think Jasmine communicates very well and for that matter, Isaiah has no trouble at all letting everyone around him know when something isn\u2019t going his way,\u201d Jessica joked right back.</p><p>\u201cYou have that right,\u201d Lucas added.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m the only one with a perfect child,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d everyone else said in unison, which brought on more good natured laughter.</p><p>\u201cOkay, kids can be quite demanding when they want something but even though I didn\u2019t know I would love fatherhood so much I seriously couldn\u2019t imagine my life without Jacob in it. He\u2019s just so amazing,\u201d Alex said in awe.</p><p>\u201cAgreed little bro,\u201d Lucas said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is a grown up night. No more talk of our kids. I get one glass of wine and anything at all I want to eat. If it causes problems with Isaiah\u2019s tummy later, well that\u2019s okay because it\u2019s daddy\u2019s turn to get up with him,\u201d Amy said with a wicked smile.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve whatever you want Babe,\u201d Lucas said.</p><p>The evening progressed and Jessica relaxed. She absolutely loved Lucas and Amy and it helped to mask the tension between her and Alex. She knew at some point they were going to have to face things but she got so tired of being stressed all the time. It was nice to have a worry free evening.</p><p>When it came time to say goodnight, she was sad to watch the other couple leave. She hugged Amy tightly and promised to have a girl day later that week. She then rode home in complete silence with her husband.</p> <p>When they walked inside they both went to Jacob\u2019s room to check on him. It was well past midnight and Julia had long ago retired. Jessica wished she was still up so she could tell her how Jacob\u2019s day had been.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s back to normal,\u201d Jessica whispered.</p><p>\u201cHe was pretty much better by the time we left. I just didn\u2019t want to expose him to the water so soon after his cold,\u201d Alex said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a great mother, never doubt that,\u201d Alex said tenderly. \u201cDon\u2019t feel guilty about taking a day out without him. It\u2019s good for you and him. My parents had many vacations with just the two of them and my brothers and I are fine. They were with us more than away and we always knew how much they loved us,\u201d he finished.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the same at my home. I knew my parents always loved me. I would have traded a little bit of that to have a sibling though. I got really lonely sometimes,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>He knew she was implying she would like to have another child. As much as he would love to have another one they didn\u2019t have that kind of marriage.</p><p>\u201cI should get some work done,\u201d he said, deciding to avoid the subject. \u201cI\u2019m going to change,\u201d he added, before walking to their bedroom.</p><p>Jessica would normally have let him leave but she decided to give her marriage everything she had. While he was changing in the bathroom she stripped off her clothes and lay down in their bed, with the soft lighting showing everything.</p><p>Alex stepped out of the bathroom, planning on heading straight out of the room but one look at his wife and his plans changed. He walked to the bed, like he was a puppet on a string. He stripped out of the clothes he\u2019d just put on and climbed in the bed beside her without a single word.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around him and when their lips met a fire exploded throughout her entire body. When he rubbed her from breast to hip and back up again it was like a trail of lava was searing her. She couldn\u2019t stop the sounds of pleasure escaping her lips.</p> <p>She took control back from him before she was unable to think. She pushed him over on his back and climbed on top of him continuing the passionate kiss. She finally released his lips and trailed hers down the side of his neck.</p><p>She was encouraged by the shivers racking his body and the gasp that escaped his lips as her hands trailed lower and lower on his body.</p><p>She continued kissing him down the column of his throat, over his smooth pecks and lower, to his rock hard abs. She ran her tongue in swirls over the small trail of hair leading her to his engorged manhood.</p><p>He tried to pull her back up to him. \u201cNo, it\u2019s my turn,\u201d she simply said and he lay back down and let her please him. It took his full willpower not to flip her over and plunge inside of her quivering body.</p><p>\u201cJessica,\u201d he moaned out loud, when she licked the top of his thigh. He really couldn\u2019t take much more.</p><p>She took a second to look up at him seductively, before she finally ran her tongue up and down the full length of him. His whole body shook from the pleasure she was giving him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he begged. He didn\u2019t know whether he was begging her to continue or to stop.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word as she finally took him deep into her mouth and his whole body arched off the bed. She moved her head up and down his shaft, while gripping him and mimicking the movement with her hand.</p> <p>She swirled her tongue around his head and he jerked up. \u201cEnough,\u201d he growled as he grabbed her in a lightening quick movement and flipped her under him.</p><p>\u201cI will finish inside of you, with you quivering around me in pleasure,\u201d he said between clinched teeth.</p><p>She jerked her hips upward towards him. She could feel him right there at her entrance but he wouldn\u2019t push inside her.</p><p>Now she was the one to beg, \u201cPlease Alex,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute. I don\u2019t want this to end before it even begins.\u201d He groaned as she rubbed against him again.</p><p>He took her hands and placed them over her head and then brought his lips to hers again. He kissed her with all the pent up passion of a man drowning. He was drowning in her.</p><p>\u201cPlease Alex,\u201d she begged him again.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take anymore and with one thrust he was buried deep inside her. They both moaned in pleasure at the fulfillment of their joined bodies.</p><p>He started moving and the waiting ended. He thrust quickly in and out of her, as their panting both escalated. \u201cAlex,\u201d she shouted as her body started convulsing around him. He thrust inside of her and groaned out loud at his own release.</p><p>They both lay there, motionless. Her hands were rubbing up and down, from his shoulder blades to his lower back and then up again. He finally got off her and she moaned her displeasure at the separation.</p><p>\u201cShh, I\u2019m too heavy for you,\u201d he said. She thought he would get up and leave but he held her close to him and after he covered them both he rubbed her back until sleep overtook them.</p><p>Alex lay there for a long time, still stroking her back and thinking their love making was so much more than sex. He knew he should\u2019ve walked away and let them both think clearly but there was no way he could. When he\u2019d come out of the bathroom and saw her beautiful body glowing under the soft light of the lamp, he was drawn to her</p><p>He finally got out of the bed, when he knew she was sound asleep. She moaned and reached for him. When she found only empty space, her brow furrowed but she didn\u2019t wake up.</p><p>Alex headed to the bathroom and took a long shower. He let the spray try and wash away the tension that seemed to be ever present in his shoulders. It didn\u2019t do any good. He finally gave up and decided to go back to bed. He would try and get some sleep and figure things out later.</p><p>As soon as he climbed back into the bed she immediately snuggled up to him. Even in her sleep she was drawn to him. He gave up for the night trying to create distance and held her, quickly falling into a deep sleep. An earthquake couldn\u2019t have roused him.</p><p>The next morning, he woke before Jessica and got up and left. He avoided her the rest of the afternoon and even though he caught her shooting sad looks at him whenever they passed each other he knew it was better to create some distance.</p><p>Alex sat in his office and rubbed his pounding temples. He knew he\u2019d been avoiding Jessica far too much and he wanted to just go back to the way things had been.</p><p>Everything that had happened over the last several months seemed to keep pulling them further and further apart. He was trying to keep distance between them to prevent the very problems he seemed to have created.</p><p>That night at dinner she\u2019d barely touched her food and she seemed to have so much sadness about her and he knew he could fix it. He didn\u2019t know how to make their problems fade away without giving her his heart.</p><p>She was a reasonable person. If he explained they were doing what was best for their son, she\u2019d understand a marriage didn\u2019t have to be filled with romance and love. It needed to be filled with an understanding that two people did the best they could in order to be great parents.</p><p>Even as the thoughts were flitting through his head he knew they sounded wrong but he was convincing himself everything was fine. He once again stayed in the office far too late, making sure she was asleep before he entered their bedroom.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Jessica made a decision. She was head over heels in love with her husband and he\u2019d seemed to pull further and further away from her. She\u2019d been hopeful during those months when he\u2019d seemed to open up to her and their marriage had seemed real. She couldn\u2019t live half-way in the marriage and half-way out.</p><p>There were times when everything was perfect and then he would seem to notice he was too relaxed and once again pull away from her. The hot and cold was almost worse than if he was just cold all the time. When he was open with her, it gave her hope they could be a real couple.</p><p>She slowly gained her courage and walked down the stairs to her husband\u2019s home office. She took another deep breath outside his door and then stepped in, with her head held high.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Alex asked with concern. She normally didn\u2019t disturb him in the office, with one exception when they\u2019d ended up making love in front of the fireplace.</p><p>His eyes were automatically drawn to that spot and he could feel his body\u2019s response. He quickly squelched it and turned back to Jessica.</p><p>She was standing there before him and he was thinking he could take her right there on top of his desk. Her eyes held a determination within them that let him know she needed to talk. Seriously, he had to stop his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if things are okay,\u201d she began.</p><p>Alex was getting really concerned. \u201cJacob...\u201d he began. He started getting up, ready to charge up the stairs to his son.</p><p>\u201cJacob\u2019s fine. This has to do with us. I need to talk to you about our relationship.\u201d Jessica felt her heart breaking in half as she watched the shutters quickly close into place on her husband\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cOur relationship is fine.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate, just looked back down at his computer screen, as if the discussion was over and there was no need to interrupt his work any longer.</p><p>He absolutely didn\u2019t want to have the conversation. He knew it had been coming for quite a long time. He didn\u2019t want to hurt her but he couldn\u2019t lose her either. He was feeling more stress than he ever had in his life.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, our relationship isn\u2019t okay for me anymore,\u201d she stressed. \u201cAlex, I love you. I have been in love with you for a while now and I can\u2019t live in this marriage, loving you with all my heart, while wondering when you\u2019re going to walk out the door.\u201d She finished, as a tear slipped down her cheek.</p><p>His heart warmed for a moment as she once again told him she loved him. He refused to allow the warmth though and blocked his emotions. He would reason with her, he would make things okay for them.</p><p>She\u2019d been hopeful to get through the conversation with no tears. She didn\u2019t want to appear weak and she didn\u2019t want him feeling sorry for her. She wanted his love or nothing at all.</p><p>He looked at her with the same shuttered expression, although she\u2019d thought for a moment, he\u2019d shown some warmth. She\u2019d most likely imagined it because he had a guarded look that wasn\u2019t going to change anytime soon. He sat back in his chair for a full two minutes before finally speaking.</p><p>\u201cJessica, I care for you greatly. You are an incredible mother and a great wife. I\u2019m comfortable with the way things are. I never wanted to marry, because other than my parents and my brother, I haven\u2019t exactly seen a lot of shining examples of lasting love. I know you want me to say, \u2018I love you,\u2019 but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just not who I am. I\u2019m giving you everything I\u2019m capable of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His words were like knives stabbing her again and again. She didn\u2019t know how it was possible to still be standing there. She pressed her hand against her heart, pressing in. The pain was so deep; it felt as if there was a gaping hole in her chest. She really thought her heart may explode from the intensity of the pain coursing through her.</p><p>\u201cI understand Alex but then I can no longer stay married to you. You are an amazing father and I would never keep Jacob from you again. We\u2019ll have to work out all the details but I just can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She turned and walked from the room. She was choking on the sobs that wanted to rip from her body but she managed somehow to hold them back.</p><p>Jessica didn\u2019t know how she arrived in the bedroom she\u2019d shared with Alex for almost a year. Their nights had been amazing. That was the only time he\u2019d completely let down his guard. When he\u2019d looked into her eyes, she\u2019d convinced herself it was love shining through their blue depths.</p><p>She turned away from the bed. She couldn\u2019t look at it. She walked across the hall and checked in on Jacob. He was sound asleep in his crib and looked so peaceful. He\u2019d grown so much his first year of life. She was amazed how beautiful he was.</p> <p>She loved how much he resembled his father. She rubbed his small, mostly bald head. He didn\u2019t wake up. He was content in his crib. She wouldn\u2019t disturb him right then. She would pick him up the next day.</p><p>She knocked on Julia\u2019s door and it was quickly answered. \u201cHi Jessica, is everything okay?\u201d she asked with real concern. Obviously, Jessica thought, she wasn\u2019t doing a very good job of hiding her emotions.</p><p>\u201cEverything is fine. I just wanted to let you know I\u2019ll be gone this evening. You have my number if Jacob wakes and there are any problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure things will be fine. Are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d Julia asked again.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks, I will see you in the morning.\u201d With that Jessica turned and walked back into her bedroom. There was no way she could sleep there that night. She would go find a hotel room and then look for something more permanent the next day. Her son would be fine overnight. She would make sure she was back before he woke up. She packed an overnight bag and slipped out of the house.</p> <p>As she climbed into her car she had to wait a few moments because she was crying so hard she couldn\u2019t see to drive properly. When she finally pulled herself together and her vision cleared she turned away from the house. She watched it in her rearview mirror until the trees blocked her view.</p><p>Leaving was about the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done. The further she got from the house, the more she was regretting the decision. She loved Alex so much and leaving him was even more painful than staying with him, even without his love.</p><p>She decided to turn around and head back towards the house, when her car was suddenly filled with bright lights. \u201cWhat...\u201d she began to say aloud, when there was a huge crashing sound and she blacked out.</p><p>Alex sat as his desk with his head in his hands. He was already regretting his words to Jessica. The longer he thought the more he realized she wasn\u2019t demanding anything of him that he didn\u2019t have to give.</p><p>All thoughts of work were gone. He was thinking back to his time with Jessica. He couldn\u2019t wait to walk in the door each evening to see her. He noticed throughout his days, he would continually check the time, counting down the hours until he could return home. He\u2019d done far more work from home, than he\u2019d ever done in the past. Anything that didn\u2019t require him to be in the office was done from home.</p><p>He was also delegating far more work than he\u2019d ever done in the past. He just wanted to spend time with his son and his wife. Work was no longer the top priority to him it used to be.</p> <p>Their nights were unlike anything else he\u2019d ever known. She was always eager to fall into his arms. She was the most beautiful creature he\u2019d ever known. He could picture her pregnant with many more of his children. He couldn\u2019t picture his life without her.</p><p>His heart seemed to grow too full for his chest, as the realization hit him. He did love her. \u201cI love her,\u201d he mumbled out loud, just to hear how it sounded and to know how it felt to say it. He felt his mouth lift up in a grin. He loved her. He wanted to shout it from the rooftops.</p><p>He knew he\u2019d sat there to long but he needed to get control over his own emotions. He finally got up to go talk to Jessica. He hated the pain he\u2019d caused her. He couldn\u2019t believe he\u2019d just sat there as the tears rolled down her cheeks and the pain flashed in her eyes. Well that would never happen again. He would make up for that and so much more.</p><p>He walked up to their bedroom and there was no sign of her. He went searching throughout the rest of the house, with no signs. He started to worry. He walked back to his son\u2019s room and found Julia in there. \u201cDo you know where Jessica is?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had both gone out. She came in about an hour ago, saying she would be out for the night,\u201d she replied. Her eyes then narrowed slightly, as she looked at him. \u201cShe looked like something was really bothering her, although she was doing her best to cover it up,\u201d she finished accusingly.</p><p>Alex headed over to his room, planning on calling her phone. His extension rang before he had a chance to make the call. He picked up on the first ring, \u201chello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this Alex Anderson?\u201d the stranger\u2019s voice asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, can I help you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir, your wife has been in an auto accident. She\u2019s at the Mercy West Hospital in surgery and you are listed as her emergency contact,\u201d the stranger said with sympathy.</p><p>Alex dropped the phone without another word and ran for the door. He shouted out for Tina to notify his and Jessica\u2019s families and then raced to his car. He couldn\u2019t lose her. Please God, he prayed, don\u2019t take her from me.</p><p>Alex made it to the hospital in record time. He couldn\u2019t even remember the drive. One moment he hopped into his car and the next he was rushing in the emergency entrance doors. \u201cI\u2019m looking for my wife, Jessica Anderson!\u201d He was practically shouting at the poor receptionist.</p><p>\u201cOne moment sir,\u201d the efficient nurse looked at her computer for what seemed like hours. \u201cShe arrived about an hour ago and is still in surgery. I need you to fill out these papers please,\u201d she requested, as she pulled out a packet of paperwork.</p><p>\u201cTo hell with the paperwork, I want to know what\u2019s happening with my wife!\u201d He shouted at the woman.</p><p>\u201cSir, I understand you\u2019re upset right now but the doctor will be out shortly to inform you of your wife\u2019s condition. We really do need these papers filled out,\u201d she tried once again.</p><p>Alex was about to grab this insufferable woman by her shirt lapels and demand to be taken to Jessica, when a hand clasped his shoulder. \u201cCome on son, let\u2019s fill out this paperwork and wait to hear from the doctor.\u201d Alex\u2019s shoulders slumped in defeat. His father was there and he was right.</p><p>\u201cOkay Dad,\u201d he conceded in defeat.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re worried, boy. We all are but your family is here now and we\u2019ll wait together. Jessica is strong and I know she will pull through this.\u201d Alex thanked God to have his family there with him. He couldn\u2019t sit in the waiting room and maintain his composure without them.</p><p>A few minutes later his brothers, Lucas and Mark were there with him and then Jessica\u2019s father, John. No one did any talking. They were there to be a support system. Lucas\u2019s wife Amy came in with coffee and food for everyone and wrapped Alex in a hug. \u201cIt will all be okay. She\u2019s strong,\u201d she said, then kissed his cheek, before heading over to sit with her husband.</p><p>\u201cSon, let\u2019s take a walk,\u201d Joseph said and lead Alex from the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat if the doctor comes in, Dad?\u201d Alex asked in a panic.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t go far and trust me, if the doctor does come in one of your brothers will get you right away,\u201d Joseph reassured him.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Alex said, realizing he really did need some air to clear his head.</p><p>\u201cIs everything going okay for you and Jessica?\u201d Joseph asked. He was never one to mince words and got right to the heart of the matter.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been a great husband,\u201d Alex said, fighting hard to hold back a sob. \u201cShe told me she loved me and I just freaked a bit. I was so afraid if I admitted to her how much I cared about her she would end up being disappointed in me and walking away. I\u2019ve been a fool,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cWell admitting that is the first step,\u201d Joseph said with a small chuckle.</p><p>Alex didn\u2019t find humor in his father\u2019s words. \u201cI do love her,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cHave you told her that?\u201d his dad asked.</p><p>\u201cI was going too but we kind of had a fight and that\u2019s why she was out driving. This is all my fault and if anything has happened to her, I will never be able to forgive myself,\u201d Alex whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be okay Alex and you\u2019ll have the rest of your life to reassure her how much you truly love her. When two people are meant to be together, nothing can stop them except their own bullheadedness. I\u2019m glad to see you waking up,\u201d Joseph slightly lectured.</p><p>\u201cThanks Dad. I wonder where that stubbornness came from,\u201d Alex added.</p><p>\u201cAh boy, your mamma has had to kick me in the butt a few times and I sure deserved it but you know I would walk on fire for that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was possible to have a love as great as yours and mom\u2019s but now I know how wrong I have been. Knowing Jessica is hurt and not being able to do anything about it is like ripping a piece of my soul away from me. I need to make her better,\u201d Alex pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve sure grown into a fine young man. You know I\u2019m always here for you and we\u2019ll get through this. Families always stick together. There\u2019s no way Jessica will leave her son behind so have faith, say a lot of prayers and know everything will work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks dad. I\u2019ll feel better once the doctor lets me see her,\u201d Alex said, glancing through the doors, into the waiting room.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s head back inside,\u201d Joseph said and they walked back towards the family.</p><p>Alex paced the room for what seemed like the hundredth time when a doctor walked through the doors. The man headed towards the large group. \u201cAlex Anderson?\u201d he questioned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Alex answered quickly.</p><p>\u201cYour wife is out of surgery. She\u2019s in stable condition but the next twenty-four hours are critical. She\u2019s in a coma right now but we have every confidence she\u2019ll wake within the next few days. Her collar was broken and she had a large cut on her left leg. We\u2019ve fixed both those things. Her head was hit pretty hard and that\u2019s our main concern right now. We had to relieve the pressure built up and will have to keep an eye on her.\u201d The doctor finally stopped speaking.</p><p>Alex stood digesting the words the doctor was saying to him feeling like he was being slapped. He was so worried about Jessica. \u201cCan I please see her?\u201d It took all of Alex\u2019s control not to grab the doctor and demand to be taken to his wife. He wasn\u2019t normally a man who would ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s being moved into her room right now. The nurse will take you up in a few minutes,\u201d the doctor replied and then left through the double doors.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait here, son,\u201d Joseph said, while patting Alex\u2019s arm.</p><p>A few minutes later a led Alex through some corridors into Jessica\u2019s room. Alex gasped in shock as he saw Jessica lying in the large bed. Her face was bruised up and slightly swollen. He felt a tear slip down his cheek, as he realized how close he\u2019d come to losing her.</p><p>He pulled the chair up next to her bed and gently placed her hand in his. \u201cJessica, I\u2019m so sorry for everything I have put you through. We\u2019ll be just fine. Please wake up, so we can be a family. I love you so much and can\u2019t live without you,\u201d he said to her, willing her to open her eyes and look at him.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t stir. He sat with her the rest of the night. The nurse had come in and told him visiting hours were over but gave up after a few minutes, knowing she couldn\u2019t budge the devoted husband.</p><p>The next day a doctor stepped into the room and was looking at some charts. \u201cWell, we have some great news, Mr. Anderson. She\u2019s healing nicely and should wake up anytime. It also looks like the baby wasn\u2019t affected by the accident and her pregnancy is just fine,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Alex sat in shock. He had a mixture of emotions running through him. Did she know she was pregnant? She would\u2019ve told him. \u201cHow far along is she?\u201d he finally choked out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I assumed you already knew,\u201d the doctor seemed to stumble over his words. He glanced back down at the chart. \u201cShe\u2019s about twelve weeks along,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>Alex\u2019s face lit with joy. They were going to have another child. He loved his son so much and now they were going to have a sibling for him. Even better, he would be there for the entire pregnancy. He would see his child come into the world and he would be there every single day to enjoy the entire pregnancy.</p> <p>He sat there next to Jessica and thanked the heavens for the blessings in his life. His wife was going to be fine, although he\u2019d feel much better once she finally opened her eyes. He was going to have another child to love. Jacob was the most perfect child in the universe. It only seemed right to bring more children into the world. He smiled to himself, thinking he sounded a bit prejudiced but that was alright too.</p><p>He vowed he would never let anything bad ever happen again to anyone in his family. He couldn\u2019t stand to feel so helpless.</p><p>Later that afternoon both families came in to check on Jessica, bringing in more flowers and balloons. Her room looked like a floral shop from all the arrangements people dropped off wishing her better.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have another baby,\u201d Alex excitedly stated to everyone in the room. He knew he should wait to tell everyone until Jessica was awake but he couldn\u2019t help himself. He was too excited about it.</p><p>There was a moment of silence, before the room erupted in excited chatter. \u201cCongratulations son,\u201d Joseph nearly shouted before grabbing Alex up in a huge bear hug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, just wonderful,\u201d John added with tears in his eyes.</p> <p>His brothers each gave him a hard hug and Amy kissed him on the cheek. They were equally as excited as he was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if Jessica even knows yet but I couldn\u2019t wait to tell everyone,\u201d Alex stated, sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cAlex.\u201d His head whipped around, as he heard the quiet whisper of his name spoken. Jessica\u2019s eyes were cracked open in confusion and she was looking right at him.</p><p>\u201cBaby, it\u2019s so good to see you awake.\u201d He settled down into the chair next to his wife and took her hand into his.</p><p>\u201cWh...What happened?\u201d she finally managed to croak out. Her throat felt like sandpaper. The rest of the room went completely silent.</p><p>\u201cYou were in a terrible car accident but everything\u2019s fine now. You should be able to return home in a few days,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. I was driving and then everything went black,\u201d she said, sounding scared.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to worry about. The doctor said you\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d he reassured her.</p> <p>\u201cJacob\u2019s okay, right?\u201d she asked. Her heart monitor started beating as she frantically looked around the room for her son.</p><p>\u201cJacob is fine. You need to relax, your heart rate is getting too high,\u201d he said calmly and breathed a sigh of relief as the beeping slowed. \u201cHe\u2019s home with Julia. She will be down here in about an hour with him,\u201d he said and kissed her gently.</p><p>Jessica drank in Alex\u2019s face. He looked like he was the one who had been in an accident. His eyes had dark circles and his face was unshaven. His clothes were in desperate need of changing. He\u2019d never looked better to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the things I said. I do love you more than you could ever imagine. I was just scared. You\u2019ve held my heart for so long and I was afraid if I told you how I felt you\u2019d somehow hold control over me. I should\u2019ve realized sooner it did not matter. When I thought I could lose you I went out of my mind. Please forgive me for being so stupid,\u201d he pled to her.</p><p>Neither of them noticed their families quietly slipping out of the room, giving them much needed privacy. They didn\u2019t notice the happy looks between Joseph and John, the two meddling fathers.</p><p>\u201cOf course I forgive you Alex. I love you so much. I wanted to come home the minute I left. I was already thinking I\u2019d rather live with you, without love than without you,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to be alright?\u201d He asked her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be more than alright. I think we can finally be a real family,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of families,\u201d he began, \u201chow do you feel about giving Jacob a new brother or sister?\u201d</p><p>Jessica beamed at him. \u201cNothing would make me feel better than having a houseful of children running around, filling up the empty corners,\u201d she beamed at him. \u201cAs soon as I get out of here, we\u2019ll have to start working on that.\u201d</p><p>Alex gave her a blinding smile. \u201cI don\u2019t mind practicing for baby number three but number two is already cooking,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jessica looked at her husband in confusion for a few moments before she realized what he was saying. \u201cAre we...\u201d she began, when he nodded his head. \u201cWe\u2019re really pregnant?\u201d she asked with hope.</p><p>Alex nodded his head. He was so overcome with emotions he couldn\u2019t speak for a moment. He found it amusing he was the one telling her they were pregnant as it was normally the other way around.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she gasped. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey ran all kinds of tests to make sure you were alright and found you were twelve weeks along. The baby\u2019s fine. As a matter-of-fact, they are going to bring a monitor in this afternoon so we can have our first peak at the little one,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t know I was pregnant. I just thought I had a touch of the flu. I guess even the flu can\u2019t last that long,\u201d she said feeling a little foolish.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve noticed something was up myself. You have been sleeping a lot and hardly eating. We have to get you taken care of so you can properly take care of our baby,\u201d he said and gently rubbed her belly, which had a small bump on it.</p><p>Jessica looked at his hand on her stomach and gave a small laugh, \u201cI thought I was just putting on weight,\u201d she said, turning a little pink.</p><p>\u201cI would love you no matter what you looked like,\u201d he said and she could see he really meant it.</p><p>Jessica was thrilled to be carrying another baby of Alex\u2019s. \u201cI never thought my life could be this perfect. I love you. Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you to Jessica and I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life showing you just how much,\u201d he said as he gently kissed her.</p><p>Jessica shivered as the doctor applied the cold gel to her belly but soon all her pain seemed to fade away as she got her first look at their baby.</p><p>\u201cIs that her?\u201d Alex asked in awe, as a perfect little head came into view on the monitor. He was gripping Jessica\u2019s hand in his as he got the first image of their child.</p><p>\u201cHow are you so sure our child is a girl?\u201d Jessica asked with a proud smile. She too had a feeling the baby was a girl.</p><p>\u201cBecause this world won\u2019t be complete without a mirror image of you in it,\u201d he stated as fact.</p><p>Jessica\u2019s eyes filled with tears once again. She couldn\u2019t believe just a couple of short days ago she\u2019d been filled with such despair. She felt like she would burst wide open from the joy she was feeling.</p><p>Her eyes returned to the monitor and she took in every detail of the three dimensional image of her child, whom was safe within her womb becoming stronger each day.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being a wonderful husband and father,\u201d she said, barely able to get the words out of her tightened throat.</p><p>\u201cNo Jessica, it\u2019s me who needs to thank you for having so much faith. I love you, Jacob and our daughter,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jessica knew from that day forward her life would be a great adventure and even though there would be trials now and then, things would work out for them all. She looked from the monitor to her husband and then sent up a silent thank you to God for blessing her life with so much.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Joseph loved Thanksgiving. It was a time of gathering with his family, eating great food and reflecting back on another wonderful year with his dear family and friends. He had so much more to be thankful for this past year with the birth of another beautiful granddaughter and three other grandkids.</p><p>He cuddled Emily close to him and breathed in her magical scent. She was only one week old and he\u2019d been overjoyed when she\u2019d made her entrance into the world.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a great gift to our family,\u201d he whispered to her gently, while stroking her soft head.</p><p>Emily stared up at her grandfather, seeming to be mesmerized by his voice.</p><p>\u201cTell us another story gampa,\u201d Jasmine demanded.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied to his eldest grandchild. \u201cTwas the night before Christmas when all through the house...\u201d he began and all four grandkids gave their full attention to their grandfather.</p><p>Just as Joseph was finishing his story, Emily started to fuss and Jessica walked into the warm den. \u201cIt sounds to me like Emily\u2019s ready for her Thanksgiving dinner Dad,\u201d she said to him, before bending down and giving him a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>Joseph reluctantly handed Emily over to her mother. She chuckled at him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry grandpa, you can have her back soon,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the kids out and let you have some privacy,\u201d he replied gruffly before departing.</p><p>Jessica sat down in the comfortable rocker Joseph had purchased for her and Amy. She fed her child and felt so much contentment she could easily overflow.</p><p>\u201cThere you are. Dinner is being served. When you are done feeding her, I can burp her while you go sit down. You need to keep your energy up,\u201d Alex said as he walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done,\u201d Jessica said quietly.</p><p>They sat there in a companionable silence while Emily finished eating. Jessica then handed her over to her father and sat with them as he gently burped her. \u201cYou can go eat,\u201d he said with an affectionate smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know but I\u2019d rather wait. I still can\u2019t get over how wonderful she looks in your arms. Your hands are bigger than her little body,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Alex chuckled. He\u2019d been so afraid to hold his tiny daughter the first time. She was so little, he felt as if he\u2019d break her but once Jessica placed Emily in his arms he knew he could hold her twenty-four hours a day and it still wouldn\u2019t be enough.</p><p>Alex finished burping her and she was sound asleep. He laid her down in her bassinet and then walked hand in hand towards the laughter coming from the dining room.</p><p>Joseph was out on the balcony saying a prayer. He was so thankful for his ever-growing family. He got a twinkle in his eyes as he thought about his youngest son. \u201cAh Mark, I\u2019ve found you the perfect match,\u201d he whispered into the night.</p> <p>Joseph chuckled to himself as he imagined his youngest son fighting to keep his bachelorhood. He would definitely fight it but the fall would be ever so sweet.</p><p>\u201cJoseph, everyone\u2019s waiting on you,\u201d came the sweet sound of his Katherine\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThey can wait one more moment. Come here my beautiful wife,\u201d he said, while holding his arm out towards her.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms and kissed her with a deep love that went beyond passion. She was a part of his soul. He\u2019d been through the good and the bad with his wife and prayed each night they\u2019d have many more years together.</p><p>\u201cOkay my bride, let\u2019s go have some dinner,\u201d he finally said. They walked hand in hand into the dining room. Joseph looked around the large table, filled with laughter and a bit of chaos.</p> <p>Jacob was mashing his food all over his face and high chair. Jasmine was giggling about something her uncle Mark said to her and Isaiah was asleep in his father\u2019s arms. Joseph looked towards the den and knew baby Emily was safe in her basinet.</p><p>He was so filled with love he had to sit there for a few moments before finally standing to make a toast. Everyone knew Thanksgiving dinner didn\u2019t officially begin until he\u2019d made a toast and each year the blessings became greater and greater, making him appreciate so much more.</p><p>\u201cI would like to make a toast,\u201d Joseph began in his normal booming voice. \u201cI\u2019m so thankful for the new additions to our family. Amy and Jessica, you have brought such light and joy to my sons and I will be grateful each and every day you somehow manage to tame these hooligans,\u201d he said.</p><p>Everyone at the table laughed, while the happy couples moved just a little bit closer to each other.</p><p>\u201cOf course the biggest blessing of all is to finally have the pattering of little feet running about. I love each of you beautiful babies,\u201d he continued, as he looked at Jacob, Jasmine and Isaiah. \u201cAnd what a blessing to have Emily born just one week before this most thankful of days,\u201d he said and then gave a slight cough.</p><p>Everyone knew he was trying to contain his emotion, so they all pretended not to notice and gave him a moment to regain his composure.</p> <p>\u201cI know this next year will be filled with many more blessings,\u201d he said and looked over at Mark, his youngest son, who started to squirm a bit in his seat.</p><p>\u201cHa little brother, I think dad\u2019s prophesying you\u2019re going to be the next to give him a grandkid,\u201d Lucas goaded his youngest brother.</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019m a confirmed bachelor,\u201d he said on a laugh but there also seemed to be a longing in his eyes which both Jessica and Amy spotted. They looked at each other and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYour brothers were too until they met the love of their lives. Now they\u2019re far happier than they ever were before. We\u2019re meant to have someone by our side,\u201d he said. He then took his beautiful wife Katherine\u2019s hand in his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m most grateful of all for every day I\u2019m blessed enough to spend with you. You\u2019re my light, my whole reason for being,\u201d he said. Everyone was silent as they witnessed a love that couldn\u2019t be matched.</p><p>\u201cI love you too Joseph,\u201d she replied, before discretely wiping a tear from her face.</p><p>\u201cNow let\u2019s eat this wonderful food that\u2019s been prepared,\u201d he said in a slightly cracked voice.</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d everyone shouted. The rest of the night was filled with laughter and remembered times.</p>  </body></html>"]
