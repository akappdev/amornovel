Roaming the air-conditioned aisles, she decided to make her specialty\u2014a macaroni-and-cheese casserole\u2014for dinner that night. Some might consider it more of a winter meal, not really suitable for the middle of July, but Teri liked it any time of year. And Bobby\u2014well, Bobby was hardly aware of what season it was, or for that matter, what time of day.</p><p>When she got home, she found her husband in front of a chessboard, deep in concentration. That in itself wasn\u2019t unusual. But the board was set up on the kitchen table and her younger brother was sitting across from him. Two out-of-the-ordinary occurrences.</p><p>Johnny grinned sheepishly when she walked in with her bag of groceries. \u201cI came by for a quick visit and Bobby insisted on teaching me,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>Bobby mumbled something, probably an acknowledgment of her presence. He often muttered to himself, lost in his own world of chess moves and strategies. To say her husband was a bit unconventional would be an understatement. Bobby Polgar was an international chess sensation, one of the top-ranked players in the world.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Teri asked as she set the groceries on the counter.</p><p>Johnny answered with a good-natured shrug. \u201cHaven\u2019t got a clue. Ask Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, sweetheart,\u201d she said, moving to her husband\u2019s side of the table. Slipping her arms around his neck, she kissed his cheek.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s hand squeezed hers and he looked across at Johnny. \u201cAlways protect your queen,\u201d he advised her brother, who nodded patiently.</p> <p>\u201cCan you stay for dinner?\u201d she asked Johnny. A visit from him, especially on a weekday, was a pleasant surprise. Teri was proud of Johnny, but she also felt protective of him. That was only natural, she supposed, because she\u2019d practically raised him herself. Her family\u2014like Bobby, was unconventional\u2014but in a completely different way. At last count, her mother had been married six times. Or was it seven? Teri had lost count.</p><p>Her sister was more like her mother than Teri had ever been, but at least Christie was smart enough not to marry the losers who walked in and out of her life. Not that Teri was exempt from some of life\u2019s painful lessons herself. Particularly those that fell into the category of men-who-use-and-abuse.</p><p>Teri still had a hard time believing Bobby Polgar could love her. She worked in a hair and nail salon and considered herself the farthest thing from an intellectual. Bobby always said she had a real-world intelligence, practical and intuitive rather than cerebral, like his. She loved him for saying that and was even starting to believe it. In fact, she loved everything about him. The happiness she felt was still new to her and it actually frightened her a little.</p><p>She had reasons to be concerned, real-world reasons, she thought wryly, although she made light of them. Recently two men had approached her, bodyguard-types who looked like they belonged in an episode of The Sopranos. They had gangster written all over them. They hadn\u2019t really done anything, though, other than scare her for a few minutes.</p><p>Teri wasn\u2019t sure what that was all about. Apparently these goons had been sent as a warning to Bobby. The message seemed to be that their boss, whoever he was, could get to her at any time. Fat chance of that! Teri was street-smart and she\u2019d learned how to take care of herself, although she had to admit those two had given her pause.</p><p>If Bobby knew who was responsible for the threat against her, he wasn\u2019t saying. But she\u2019d noticed that her husband hadn\u2019t played in a single tournament since she\u2019d been approached by those men.</p> <p>\u201cI gotta get back,\u201d Johnny said in answer to her question about dinner.</p><p>\u201cJust stay for another couple of hours,\u201d she wheedled. \u201cI\u2019m making my special macaroni-and-cheese casserole.\u201d That would entice her brother like nothing else. It was his favorite dish.</p><p>\u201cCheckmate,\u201d Bobby said triumphantly, apparently unaware of the conversation around him.</p><p>\u201cIs there a way out of this?\u201d Johnny asked, returning his attention to the chessboard.</p><p>Bobby shook his head. \u201cNope. You\u2019re in the Black Hole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what?\u201d Teri and Johnny said simultaneously.</p><p>\u201cThe Black Hole,\u201d Bobby told them. \u201cOnce a player finds him or herself in this set of circumstances, it\u2019s impossible to win.\u201d</p><p>Johnny shrugged. \u201cThen there\u2019s nothing left to do but concede.\u201d He laid down his king and sighed. \u201cReally, there was never any doubt as to the outcome of this game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou play well for a beginner,\u201d Bobby told him.</p><p>Teri ruffled her younger brother\u2019s hair, despite knowing how much he hated it. \u201cConsider that a compliment.\u201d</p><p>Johnny smiled. \u201cI will.\u201d He pushed back his chair and looked at Teri. \u201cTer, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time you introduced Bobby to Mom and Christie?\u201d</p><p>Bobby turned from Johnny to Teri and innocently said, \u201cI would like to meet your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She immediately busied herself unpacking the groceries. She set the cottage cheese\u2014an essential ingredient in her macaroni recipe\u2014on the counter, along with a box of Velveeta cheese.</p><p>\u201cMom asked me about you and Bobby,\u201d her brother informed her.</p><p>\u201cIs she still with Donald?\u201d This was the latest husband. Teri had purposely avoided any discussion of her family with Bobby. They hadn\u2019t been married long and she hated to disillusion him so soon. Once he met the family, he might well have serious doubts about her, and the truth was, she wouldn\u2019t blame him.</p><p>\u201cThings are shaky.\u201d Johnny glanced over at Bobby. \u201cDonald has sort of a drinking problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonald!\u201d Teri cried. \u201cWhat about Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s cutting back.\u201d Johnny had always been quick to defend their mother.</p><p>Donald had showed promise in the beginning. Apparently he and her mother had met at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Unfortunately, they\u2019d quickly gone from supporting each other in sobriety to becoming drinking buddies. Neither of them could hold a job for long. How they survived financially, Teri didn\u2019t know. She had no intention of assisting them the way she did Johnny. It went without saying that any money she gave them would immediately go toward another bottle of booze or another night at their local bar.</p><p>Crossing her arms, Teri leaned against the kitchen counter. \u201cMom\u2019s cutting back? Yeah, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, you should have Christie over to meet Bobby.\u201d He turned toward him. \u201cChristie\u2019s our sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you have a sister?\u201d Bobby asked. He seemed perplexed that Teri had never mentioned Christie. He knew about her, of course, because he\u2019d had Teri\u2019s background checked\u2014a fact he\u2019d revealed in his usual dispassionate way.</p><p>She had her reasons for not mentioning her younger sister and Johnny knew it. She pointed an accusatory finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about Christie, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you and her?\u201d Johnny grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too young to understand all the details,\u201d she said, brushing aside his question. She and Christie were, for all intents and purposes, estranged, although Teri maintained a superficial civility on public occasions.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ter, you and Bobby are married. He should meet the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to meet your family?\u201d Bobby gazed up at her with a hurt expression. He didn\u2019t realize that this conversation had nothing to do with him and everything to do with her mother and sister.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do...someday.\u201d She gently patted Bobby\u2019s arm. \u201cI thought we\u2019d get settled in the house before I invited them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are settled.\u201d Bobby gestured around him at the gleaming appliances and polished oak floors.</p><p>\u201cNot that settled. We\u2019ll have them over in a while.\u201d She was thinking four or five years\u2014longer if she could get away with it.</p><p>\u201cMom and Christie would really like to meet Bobby,\u201d Johnny said again.</p><p>Now Teri understood why her younger brother had shown up at the house unannounced. He\u2019d been sent as an emissary by their mother and Christie. His mission was to pave the way for an introduction to the rich and famous Bobby Polgar, who\u2019d been foolish enough to marry her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to meet him sooner or later,\u201d Johnny said with perfect logic. \u201cYou can\u2019t avoid it forever, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Teri released a slow sigh.</p><p>\u201cMight as well be now.\u201d</p><p>Teri could see that she wasn\u2019t going to escape the dreaded family gathering, so she\u2019d simply take Johnny\u2019s advice. \u201cOkay, okay, I\u2019ll have everyone over for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Johnny gave her a wide grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll regret it afterward,\u201d she muttered under her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Bobby asked, obviously still perplexed by her reaction.</p><p>She hardly knew how to explain.</p><p>\u201cAre your mother and sister like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Teri had done everything possible to make choices that didn\u2019t resemble theirs\u2014with only partial success. While it was true that she never drank to excess, she\u2019d made more than one mistake in the relationship department. Until she met Bobby...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll like them, won\u2019t I?\u201d Bobby asked next, smiling at her with childlike faith.</p><p>She responded with a noncommital shrug. Her mother and sister were similar to each other in their behavior and their loser attitudes, although Teri didn\u2019t think Christie had a drinking problem so much as a man problem. Put a man in front of her, any man, and she couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>\u201cIs Christie still with...\u201d For the life of her, she couldn\u2019t remember the last man her sister had been living with.</p><p>\u201cCharlie,\u201d Johnny supplied.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was Toby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the one before Charlie,\u201d her brother said. \u201cAnd no, Charlie dumped her last month.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great. That meant her sister was on the prowl. This scenario couldn\u2019t get much worse.</p><p>\u201cChristie will make a play for Bobby,\u201d she said.</p><p>Johnny shook his head firmly. \u201cNo, she won\u2019t. You two are married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would that stop her? It hasn\u2019t before. Trust me, she\u2019ll make a play\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristie likes chess?\u201d Bobby interrupted excitedly.</p><p>Clearly he didn\u2019t grasp the exchange going on between Teri and her brother. \u201cNo, Bobby. But my sister will think you\u2019re the most brilliant, handsomest man in the world.\u201d</p><p>Bobby grinned. \u201cLike you do.\u201d</p><p>Despite her agitation, Teri nodded. \u201cOnly more so,\u201d she said grimly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re jealous,\u201d Johnny accused her.</p><p>\u201cNot Teri,\u201d Bobby said, getting up from the table. \u201cShe knows I love her.\u201d</p><p>Teri wrapped her arms around Bobby and hugged him close. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor loving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d Bobby assured her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cListen, you two lovebirds, I wish I could stay but I\u2019ve got to get back. I have a research paper that\u2019s due tomorrow.\u201d With Teri\u2019s encouragement, Johnny was taking a summer course to get a head start on the next school year. He pushed back his chair and stood. \u201cSo you\u2019ll get in touch with Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d Teri sighed, already resigned to the inevitable.</p><p>\u201cChristie, too,\u201d her brother insisted. \u201cShe is our sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark my words. Bobby won\u2019t be safe with her around.\u201d And neither will my marriage, she thought darkly.</p> <p>Teri hated to disparage their sister. But experience told her exactly what to expect. Sure as anything, Christie would throw herself at Bobby. The fact that he was married wouldn\u2019t matter. Not to Christie. Every boyfriend Teri\u2019d ever had, her sister had attempted to seduce. Bobby wouldn\u2019t be the exception, and because he was her husband, Christie would probably consider him an especially worthwhile challenge.</p><p>Poor Bobby. He had no idea. He\u2019d certainly never encountered a family like hers.</p><p>\u201cNext weekend?\u201d Johnny asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Teri said. She needed time to prepare herself for this. \u201cGive me a week to get organized. Two weeks from Saturday.\u201d</p><p>If Johnny was disappointed by the delay, it didn\u2019t show. \u201cSee you then,\u201d he said and kissed her cheek on his way out the door.</p> <p>Bobby slid his arm around her shoulders. Teri reminded herself yet again that she loved her husband and he loved her. Despite that, she couldn\u2019t entirely quell her fears.</p><p>While Bobby Polgar was unlike any man she\u2019d ever known, he was still a man. He\u2019d be just as susceptible to Christie\u2019s beauty and her undeniable charm as every other boyfriend she\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to be meeting your family,\u201d Bobby said after Johnny had left.</p><p>Smiling proved difficult. Poor Bobby, she thought again. He didn\u2019t know what he was letting himself in for.</p><p>Two</p><p>Troy Davis had been the duly elected sheriff of Cedar Cove for nearly seventeen years. He\u2019d been raised in this town, graduating from the local high school. Afterward, like many of his friends, he\u2019d enlisted in the army, where he\u2019d served as an MP. He\u2019d trained at the Presidio in San Francisco, and just before shipping out to a base in Germany, he\u2019d spent a three-day leave touring the city. That was where, on a foggy June morning in 1965, he\u2019d met Sandy Wilcox.</p> <p>After spending the day together, they\u2019d exchanged addresses and corresponded during his tour of duty. When he was discharged, Troy had asked Sandy to marry him. By then she was in college and he\u2019d joined her at SFU in San Francisco. In 1970, they were married and settled in his hometown of Cedar Cove, where Troy had accepted a job in law enforcement. He\u2019d worked as a deputy until he ran for sheriff and won. Life had been good to him, to both of them. And then Sandy had gotten sick....</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>Troy looked up from where he was seated in the living room, staring down at the carpeted floor. \u201cPastor Flemming\u2019s here,\u201d Megan said quietly. She\u2019d come over to help him organize Sandy\u2019s things\u2014figure out what should go where.</p><p>Deep in thought, Troy hadn\u2019t even heard the doorbell. He stood as the other man walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cI came to see how you\u2019re doing,\u201d the pastor from Cedar Cove Methodist church said. He was a soft-spoken, caring man who\u2019d officiated at Sandy\u2019s funeral services with compassion and sincerity. Many an afternoon, Troy had found Dave Flemming sitting with his wife, reading from the Bible or praying with her or sometimes just chatting. He\u2019d been touched by the sympathy the pastor had extended, first to Sandy and now to Megan and him.</p><p>Troy wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to the pastor\u2019s concern. \u201cWe\u2019re coping as well as we can,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>No death was easy and although Troy had felt he was prepared to lose Sandy, he wasn\u2019t. As sheriff, he\u2019d certainly seen his share of death, and it wasn\u2019t something he\u2019d ever get used to. But this one struck at the very foundations of his life. Nobody was ever truly ready to lose a wife or mother, he supposed, and Sandy\u2019s death had hit both him and Megan hard.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, just say the word.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will.\u201d Troy gestured toward the sofa. \u201cWould you care to sit down?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made a fresh pot of coffee,\u201d his daughter added. \u201cWill you have some?\u201d</p><p>Troy was proud of what a good hostess Megan had become. Ever since Sandy\u2019s multiple sclerosis had become so much worse, his daughter often filled that role for him, something she\u2019d continued to do after her marriage. Troy appreciated the way she\u2019d willingly stepped in for her mother. She\u2019d accompanied him to various functions in Sandy\u2019s place, and occasionally held dinners for family friends. They\u2019d grown especially close since Sandy had gone into the nursing home two years before.</p><p>\u201cThank you, no,\u201d Dave told them. \u201cI can\u2019t stay. But I\u2019d like to help in any way I can. If it\u2019s too painful for you to sort through Sandy\u2019s things, for instance, I\u2019d be happy to ask some of the ladies at church to lend a hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Troy assured him.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s under control,\u201d Megan said. She\u2019d already begun packing up her mother\u2019s clothes and personal effects.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two, then,\u201d Dave said and after shaking Troy\u2019s hand, the pastor let himself out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be all right, aren\u2019t we, Dad?\u201d his daughter asked him in a tentative voice that reminded him of how she\u2019d sounded as a child.</p><p>Draping his arm around her thin shoulders, Troy nodded. He usually managed to hide his pain. And for Megan\u2019s sake he even tried to smile. She had enough grief of her own to carry.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d With his daughter at his side he walked into the bedroom he\u2019d shared with his wife for more than thirty years. Boxes crammed with Sandy\u2019s clothes were scattered across the carpet. Half the closet was spread on the queen-size bed\u2014dresses, sweaters, skirts and blouses, most of which had hung there for years without being touched.</p><p>Sandy had been in the nursing home for two years. He\u2019d understood, when they settled her into the care facility, that she wouldn\u2019t be coming home again. Still, he\u2019d had difficulty reconciling himself to the knowledge that MS would eventually take her life.</p><p>It didn\u2019t. Not exactly. As with most people suffering from this disease, her immune system was so compromised that she died of pneumonia. Although it could\u2019ve been almost any virus or infection...</p><p>For her sake, Troy had made the pretense of believing she\u2019d move home one day, but in reality he\u2019d always known. He brought her whatever she asked for. As the months dragged on, Sandy stopped asking. She had everything she needed at the nursing home. Her large-print Bible, a few precious photographs and a lap robe Charlotte Jefferson had knit before she married Ben Rhodes. Sandy\u2019s needs were simple and her demands few. As the weeks and months passed, she needed less and less.</p><p>Troy had left everything in the house exactly the way it was the day he\u2019d taken her to the nursing home. In the beginning that seemed important to Sandy. It was to him, too. It helped perpetuate the pretense that she\u2019d recover. She\u2019d needed to believe it, until she no longer could, and he\u2019d wanted to hold on to the slightest shred of hope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what to do with all of Mom\u2019s clothes.\u201d Megan stood in the middle of the bedroom, her arms hanging limply at her sides. Sandy\u2019s half of the walk-in closet was bare.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea Mom had so many clothes,\u201d Megan said helplessly. \u201cShould we donate them to charity?\u201d</p><p>Troy wished now that he\u2019d asked Pastor Flemming about that. Perhaps the church had a program that collected items for the poor.</p><p>\u201cWe should.\u201d Still, if it was up to him, he wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Or at least not for a while...He didn\u2019t understand why Megan thought it was important to pack up the remnants of her mother\u2019s life so soon. When she\u2019d arrived with the cardboard boxes, Troy hadn\u2019t argued, but frankly, he didn\u2019t see the necessity of rushing into this.</p><p>\u201cMost of them are outdated now.\u201d Megan held up a pink sweater, one Sandy had always loved.</p><p>\u201cLeave everything here for now,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The vehemence with which his daughter responded surprised Troy.</p><p>\u201cMegan, let\u2019s not do something we might regret later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said again, shaking her head. \u201cMom\u2019s gone. She\u2019ll never hold her grandchildren. She\u2019ll never go shopping with me again. She\u2019ll never share a recipe with me. She\u2019ll...she\u2019ll...\u201d Tears rained down her pale cheeks.</p><p>Troy felt utterly incapable of easing her grief. He\u2019d never been good at dealing with emotions and was at an even greater loss now. Megan was an only child and she\u2019d been close to her mother. Both Sandy and Troy had wanted more children. For years, they\u2019d tried for a second child, until after the third miscarriage, when Troy had said enough. They should be grateful they had a beautiful daughter, he\u2019d told her, instead of yearning for a larger family.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been two months,\u201d he reminded Megan as gently as possible.</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot longer than that.\u201d</p><p>Troy understood this far better than Megan seemed to realize. In the end, Sandy barely resembled the woman he\u2019d married. Her death, while tragic, was a release from the physical nightmare that had become her reality. Sandy had lived with MS for at least thirty years. Not until after she miscarried the third pregnancy had she been tested. Then, and only then, were the physicians able to put a name to the seemingly random symptoms she\u2019d been experiencing for years. Multiple sclerosis.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not donate anything just yet,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s gone,\u201d Megan repeated in the same emotionally charged tone. \u201cWe both have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t have any choice but to accept the fact that his wife was dead. He wanted to tell Megan that he was well aware Sandy was gone. He was the one who walked into an empty house every night, the one who slept alone in a big bed.</p><p>Ninety per cent of his free time had been spent at the nursing home with Sandy. Now he was bereft and at loose ends. He knew he\u2019d never be the same. Like him, Megan was hurting and she needed to vent her grief, so he said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you pack everything up and I\u2019ll put the boxes in the basement,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready...when we both are, I\u2019ll bring them upstairs again. Then, and only then, should we think about donating your mother\u2019s things to charity. If we decide to do it, I\u2019ll ask Pastor Flemming to suggest an agency. There might even be one at the church.\u201d If not, he\u2019d go to St. Vincent de Paul or the Salvation Army, both organizations Sandy had supported.</p><p>For a moment it looked as if Megan wanted to argue with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgreed?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>His daughter reluctantly nodded. Glancing at her watch, she gnawed on her lower lip. That told him how close she was to breaking down. \u201cCraig will be home any minute. I should leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d He gestured toward the door.</p><p>His daughter hesitated. \u201cBut the bedroom\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s unfair, Dad. I...I didn\u2019t mean for you to have to deal with all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019m going to do is fold everything, put it inside these boxes and haul them downstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d she asked uncertainly.</p><p>He nodded. The truth was, Troy would rather be alone right now.</p> <p>She edged her way into the living room and toward the front door. \u201cI hate leaving you with this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He was more than capable of packing away a few boxes of clothes.</p><p>Megan reached slowly for her purse. \u201cYou\u2019ve thought about dinner?\u201d</p><p>So far he hadn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ll open a can of chili.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Not that skipping dinner would do him any harm. Troy figured he could easily afford to lose twenty pounds. Most of that extra weight had snuck up on him after he\u2019d moved Sandy to the nursing home. Meals became haphazard after that. He\u2019d fallen victim to the fast-food chains; there weren\u2019t many in Cedar Cove, but the few that had opened in town he knew well. Because of his job and its demands on his time, he often missed breakfast and sometimes even lunch. Then he\u2019d arrive home ravenous late in the evening and he\u2019d eat whatever was quick and easy, which usually meant high-calorie processed food. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d actually made a green salad or eaten fresh fruit.</p> <p>With Sandy gone, he\u2019d lost his emotional balance. Troy felt a sense of emptiness, a gap where his love for Sandy used to be. He still loved her, of course, but the duties and responsibilities attached to that love had disappeared. They\u2019d represented a big part of his life in the last few years.</p><p>Sandy dead at fifty-seven\u2014it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this. He should\u2019ve been the one to die first; he was the one in a dangerous profession. Practically every day someone in law enforcement was killed in the line of duty. He should\u2019ve died before his wife did. That was what all the statistics predicted. Then Sandy would\u2019ve been able to live comfortably on his pension for another ten or twenty years. Instead, his wife was gone and he was floundering.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a call later,\u201d his daughter said as she walked to the front door.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Troy stood on the porch and watched her pull out of the driveway. He felt so drained, it took an inordinate amount of energy to step back and close the door.</p><p>The house had never seemed quieter. Standing by the threshold, he was astonished by the total lack of sound. Silence reverberated around him. Generally he turned on the radio for company, or if he was desperate, the television. But tonight, even that seemed to require more ambition than he could muster.</p><p>As he went back into the bedroom with Sandy\u2019s clothes strewn about, Grace Sherman drifted into his mind. Grace Harding now, since she\u2019d married Cliff.</p><p>Funny that he\u2019d think about one of his high-school friends at a time like this. And yet, it made sense. What came to mind was an incident shortly after Dan\u2019s disappearance. Hard to believe that had been six years ago. Dan Sherman was found dead a year later.</p><p>Troy never knew exactly what had driven the other man into his own private hell. He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to know either, although he suspected it had something to do with Dan\u2019s experience in Vietnam. The war had left Dan permanently damaged in some way. Not in body but in mind, in spirit. He\u2019d become reclusive, unfriendly, refusing to share his memories and fears even with other Vietnam vets like Bob Beldon.</p> <p>When Dan disappeared, Troy had taken the missing-persons report. Several months later, he\u2019d been called by a neighbor, who was concerned about Grace. In her pain and anger, she\u2019d tossed Dan\u2019s clothing onto the front yard of their home on Rosewood Lane</p><p>Now, standing in his own room surrounded by Sandy\u2019s things, Troy remembered the sight of Dan\u2019s clothes scattered on the grass\u2014and he understood the powerful emotions that had led Grace to explode in such an uncharacteristic display. A part of him didn\u2019t want to deal with the residual effects of Sandy\u2019s life. Just limping from one day to the next was painful enough.</p><p>His gaze fell on the pink sweater Megan had so recently shown him. He picked it up and buried his nose in the soft wool. There was still a hint of his wife\u2019s favorite perfume and he breathed it in, deeply, greedily. She\u2019d worn this sweater at Easter last year. Troy had pushed her wheelchair to the open-air church services overlooking the cove. Sandy had always been a morning person, even toward the end. He used to tease her that she\u2019d been born with a happy gene.</p><p>Her smile was one of the things he\u2019d loved most about her. No matter how much he growled or muttered in the mornings, she\u2019d respond cheerfully, often making him laugh. He closed his eyes as the pain cut through him. Never again would he see Sandy\u2019s smile or hear her joyful voice.</p><p>With a heavy heart, he carefully folded the pink sweater and placed it inside the box. He wasn\u2019t ready to see someone else wearing his wife\u2019s clothes. Since they lived in a small town, it was bound to happen sooner or later. Most likely when he was least expecting it or least prepared to deal with it. Troy would turn a corner and run into another woman wearing Sandy\u2019s favorite dress. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d react to that. The mere thought twisted his gut.</p><p>The phone rang in the distance, and for half a second he was tempted just to let the caller leave a message\u2014or not. But too many years as a cop had made it impossible to ignore a ringing phone.</p><p>To Troy\u2019s surprise it was his daughter.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019re right. Keep Mom\u2019s things for now. Keep everything.\u201d</p><p>Troy could tell Megan had been crying.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cOkay, Meggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want, I\u2019ll come back tomorrow and finish packing it all up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. Hard as that would be, he was better able to deal with this one last task than his daughter. Megan\u2019s composure had shattered, while he moved through his days in a state of numbness that masked the pain.</p><p>Three</p><p>Barbecued chicken, a green salad, garlic bread\u2014a perfect dinner for a perfect summer day. With mixed berries and ice cream for dessert. Justine Gunderson enjoyed making her leisurely preparations for tonight\u2019s meal.</p><p>She pulled the covered bowl of chicken breasts out of the refrigerator. She flipped them in their soy-and-honey marinade, then set the container back inside. Like many of her favorite recipes, this one had come from her grandmother, Charlotte Jefferson Rhodes.</p><p>Leif, her almost-five-year-old son, was playing in the backyard with his dog. Penny, a cocker spaniel\u2013poodle mix, chased after the boy, barking excitedly. The pure joy of the moment made Justine smile as she stepped through the patio doors. Seth would be home soon and he\u2019d barbecue the chicken while she put the finishing touches on the salad. Leif would start setting the outdoor table, since he loved arranging the napkins and colorful place mats.</p><p>As this little domestic scene played out in her mind, she felt a sense of tranquility. Even now, all these months after the fire that had destroyed their restaurant, Justine was unaccustomed to the three of them having an uninterrupted evening together.</p><p>So much of her life\u2014their lives\u2014had been consumed by The Lighthouse. The restaurant had completely absorbed their time and energy. Until the fire, Justine and Seth rarely saw each other. Everything was always done in a rush as they divided the duties involved in running the restaurant, taking care of the house and, most important of all, raising their son. Thankfully, they\u2019d reached a compromise concerning the new restaurant they planned to open.</p><p>\u201cMommy, look!\u201d Leif shouted, throwing a stick for Penny.</p><p>The dog instantly leaped forward, racing after the stick. She picked it up, then crouched a few feet away, tail wagging frantically, and challenged the boy to grab the stick.</p><p>\u201cPenny, bring it to Leif,\u201d Justine called out.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s as stubborn as every other female in this house,\u201d Seth said from behind Justine. \u201cWell, the only other female.\u201d He slid his arms around her waist and kissed the side of her neck. Leaning into her husband, Justine tucked her hands around his and closed her eyes, reveling in the moment.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you come in,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Daddy!\u201d Leif shouted, dashing across the freshly cut lawn.</p><p>Seth scooped his son into his arms and lifted him high over his head. \u201cI see you\u2019re training Penny to play catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t give me the stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll learn,\u201d Seth told him. \u201cCome on, we\u2019ll both work with her.\u201d</p><p>While Seth and Leif played with Penny, Justine went into the house to pour her husband a cold drink. The doorbell rang; abandoning the glass of iced tea, Justine hurried to answer it.</p><p>Her grandmother stood there, clutching the huge purse Leif called her \u201cgranny bag.\u201d Among other things, it contained her current knitting project, a roll of mints, a comb and a notebook\u2014but no cellphone or credit cards. Delighted to see her, Justine threw both arms around Charlotte in a tight hug.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me coming by like this,\u201d Charlotte said as Justine led her into the house. \u201cI was in the neighborhood\u2014well, relatively speaking. Olivia said you wanted to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, you\u2019re welcome anytime, you know that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, normally I wouldn\u2019t stop in without warning, but I was chatting with your mother this afternoon and she said you wanted to ask me about recipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Justine slipped her hand in Charlotte\u2019s and they moved into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI was just getting Seth a glass of iced tea,\u201d Justine said. \u201cCan I get one for you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Charlotte set her large bag on an empty chair and sat down. These days, it was unusual to find her without Ben, her husband of three years.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, Charlotte explained. \u201cAn old friend of Ben\u2019s is visiting from out of town. I stayed long enough to meet Ralph, then made my excuses. All that talk about navy life is too much for me.\u201d She pulled her knitting out of the bag and resumed the sweater she was working on. Her grandmother didn\u2019t believe in idle hands.</p><p>Justine brought two glasses of tea and sat across from her.</p><p>\u201cNow, what can I do for you?\u201d Charlotte asked. \u201cYou need recipes for the tearoom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Justine rested both elbows on the table. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about it,\u201d she said. Although the building process hadn\u2019t yet begun, she had a clear vision of the kind of restaurant she wanted. The menu had to be exactly right, and Justine couldn\u2019t think of anyone better to consult than her own grandmother. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to plan ahead.\u201d Charlotte paused in her knitting to look at Justine. \u201cOlivia told me you\u2019re going to serve breakfast, lunch and a high tea, then close in the evenings.\u201d</p><p>Justine nodded. \u201cSeth and I decided we\u2019d rather have our evenings together. Leif\u2019s flourished in the last few months with both of us home.\u201d The arson that had destroyed The Lighthouse had eventually\u2014and unexpectedly\u2014turned out to be a blessing in a very nasty disguise. She was grateful no one had been hurt or worse. And grateful that this crime had changed their lives in a positive way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wise to put your family first.\u201d</p><p>Justine suspected her marriage wouldn\u2019t have survived another year at the rate they\u2019d been going. She glanced out at the yard, where Seth frolicked with their son and Penny.</p> <p>\u201cYou said you talked to Mom. Were you at the courthouse today?\u201d Her grandmother liked to watch Justine\u2019s mother at work. Charlotte sat proudly in Olivia\u2019s courtroom and knitted away, although her visits had become less frequent now that she\u2019d married Ben.</p><p>\u201cActually I ran into her this morning while I was in town. She was on her way to a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d</p><p>Justine tensed. She didn\u2019t remember her mother mentioning that, and they spoke nearly every day. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious,\u201d Charlotte said quickly. \u201cJust a routine visit, she told me. For her mammogram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Justine relaxed in her chair, crossed her legs and picked up her own glass of iced tea. \u201cI\u2019d like some of your recipes, Grandma,\u201d she began.</p> <p>\u201cAny in particular?\u201d Charlotte\u2019s fingers manipulated the needles and yarn with familiar ease.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to get the recipe you have for scones.\u201d They were a long-time family favorite and Charlotte baked them for nearly every family function.</p><p>Charlotte seemed pleased. \u201cThe herb-and-cheese scones are the ones I like best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother paused reflectively. \u201cMy mother used to make those scones, so that recipe actually came from her. I have a couple of other scone recipes I\u2019ll write out for you, as well,\u201d she added. \u201cClyde\u2019s favorite was a walnut-and-butter scone. Ben prefers the herb-and-cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Justine said. \u201cBut I\u2019d be happy to copy them out myself if\u2014\u201d It suddenly occurred to her that her grandmother might have all these family recipes in her head, that she might never have written them down before.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring them to you tomorrow morning,\u201d Charlotte went on. \u201cIn fact, you\u2019re welcome to all my recipes, dear. Just tell me which ones you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d Justine said, broaching the subject carefully. \u201cYou do have your recipes written down somewhere, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte laughed. \u201cGood grief, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been cooking for over seventy years. The recipes were taught to me by my mother and, well, I never thought it was necessary. I certainly wasn\u2019t going to forget them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that one,\u201d Charlotte said with a sigh. \u201cI got it from a newspaper article around 1959. I\u2019ve changed it through the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, would you write them out for me? All of them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Her knitting needles made soft clicking sounds as she continued to knit. \u201cActually, that\u2019s an excellent suggestion, Justine. I\u2019m sure Ben will approve, too. He always says I should publish a cookbook, you know. He loves my peanut butter cookies.\u201d She preened just a little.</p><p>\u201cAnd your cinnamon rolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that man married me for my baking.\u201d</p><p>Justine laughed at the absurdity of her comment. One look at Ben Rhodes, and anyone could see that he was crazy about Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me more about the tearoom,\u201d Charlotte said conversationally.</p><p>Justine smiled. \u201cWell, there\u2019s been a change in plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Her grandmother stopped knitting for a moment.</p><p>Justine uncrossed her legs and leaned forward. \u201cSeth and I couldn\u2019t tell anyone until all the details were settled. The builder, Al Finch, contacted us a few weeks ago and asked if we\u2019d be willing to sell the property. He said he might have a buyer.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed her statement. \u201cI thought you and Seth weren\u2019t interested in doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t, especially if it meant that a fast-food franchise would be built on the waterfront. But this is the best part, Grandma. The man who inquired about the land, Brian Johnson, is a friend of Al\u2019s. He\u2019s owned a number of restaurants through the years. He retired but got bored. Seth and I met with him and we were both impressed. Brian said he\u2019d like to rebuild The Lighthouse the way it was. He even wants to keep the name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was your restaurant,\u201d her grandmother protested.</p><p>\u201cTrue, but he\u2019s willing to pay us for the name and everything.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother paused again, as if she needed time to absorb the news. \u201cAre you going to do it? And what about the tearoom? Where will you build that?\u201d</p><p>Justine explained that Al Finch had shown them a piece of commercial property off Heron that he owned and was planning to sell. The location was perfect for The Victorian Tea Room. \u201cWe signed the papers earlier this week.\u201d</p><p>There was another moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t disappointed in us, are you, Grandma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her grandmother assured her. \u201cI think this is wonderful news.\u201d</p><p>So did Justine. All the hard work they\u2019d put into The Lighthouse wouldn\u2019t go to waste now. Seth had given the new owner his suggestions on how to rebuild the restaurant, and now that she was no longer involved, she looked forward to seeing it emerge from the ashes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happened so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has,\u201d Justine agreed, \u201cbut it feels right. This new location is much better for the tearoom and there\u2019s more parking. I can\u2019t believe how all of this practically fell into our laps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased for both of you,\u201d her grandmother said.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d Justine gazed longingly into the backyard. Seeing Seth with Leif brought her a feeling of contentment, of satisfaction. This was what she\u2019d always wanted, what she\u2019d hoped for in her marriage.</p><p>\u201cI should get home,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cBen\u2019s probably wondering what\u2019s keeping me.\u201d She finished her iced tea, put her knitting back in her bag and stood up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see you, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, sweetheart.\u201d She kissed Justine\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll start writing down those recipes. I\u2019ll do my best to remember them all, so if I forget any, let me know.\u201d She frowned. \u201cI\u2019d better go through the ones I cut out from magazines, too. And the ones I was given at wakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that where you got your fabulous coconut cake recipe? At a wake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014Mabel Austin\u2019s. Back in \u201984.\u201d</p><p>Justine grinned at this, but she supposed that a great recipe wasn\u2019t the worst memorial someone could have.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just step outside and say hello to Seth and Leif,\u201d Charlotte murmured as she carried her empty glass to the sink. \u201cMy goodness, that young man is growing. I don\u2019t remember him being nearly that tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth or Leif?\u201d Justine asked with a laugh. It was true; Leif was tall for his age, but then his father was a big man.</p><p>\u201cLeif, of course,\u201d her grandmother said, obviously missing the joke.</p><p>\u201cBy the way...\u201d Justine opened the patio door. \u201cWe\u2019re barbecuing chicken tonight and I\u2019m using a recipe I got from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one with soy sauce and honey? I picked that up at a wake, too.\u201d</p><p>Justine couldn\u2019t hold back a smile. \u201cWhose wake? Do you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d she answered in a dignified voice. \u201cNorman Schultz. 1992. Or was it \u201993?\u201d With that Charlotte walked outside.</p><p>Penny and Leif ran toward her. Knowing he needed to be gentle with his great-grandmother, Leif pulled up short and then stood still, giving Charlotte the opportunity to hug him. Penny, however, felt no such constraint. With one sharp command, Seth controlled the dog, who promptly sat. After she\u2019d finished chatting with Leif, Charlotte leaned over to stroke Penny\u2019s fur. She gave Justine a final wave, then Seth walked her out to her car.</p><p>When he returned to the kitchen, he asked, \u201cIs that for me?\u201d motioning toward the glass of iced tea on the counter.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d Justine said. \u201cI was about to bring it to you when my grandmother arrived.\u201d She removed an ice-cube tray from the freezer. \u201cHere. I\u2019ll add some ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, pausing to take a long drink of the tea. \u201cDid you tell her we sold the property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she think?\u201d</p><p>Justine grinned. \u201cThat we\u2019re too brilliant for words.\u201d</p><p>Seth took another swallow of the tea. The ice cubes tinkled cheerfully as he set the glass down. \u201cYour mother and Jack know, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her this morning. Speaking of which...\u201d Justine grew thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Seth urged.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t say she had a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? Should she have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess not, but it makes me wonder....\u201d She suspected there was a reason her mother didn\u2019t want her to know about the appointment, and that concerned Justine. Charlotte might have said it was \u201croutine,\u201d but was Olivia expecting bad news?</p><p>As if sensing her unease, Seth brought his arm around her waist. She felt so thankful to have her husband back. The arson had briefly changed him into an angry, vengeful man, but after Warren Saget\u2014a local builder and onetime boyfriend of hers\u2014was arrested, a burden had been lifted from her husband\u2019s shoulders. Seth was once again the man she knew and loved.</p><p>He held her for a long moment as though he, too, recognized how close they\u2019d come to destroying everything that was important to them both.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to fire up the barbecue?\u201d he asked as he released her.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I help with dinner, too, Mommy?\u201d Leif entered the kitchen with Penny at his heels.</p><p>\u201cYou sure can.\u201d Justine smiled at her son. \u201cYou can help me set the table\u2014after you wash your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They all headed outside, and while Seth was busy on the patio, Justine and Leif wiped the glass-topped table and adjusted the umbrella. Leif took great pleasure in carefully arranging the bright green place mats he\u2019d chosen and the napkins with their multicolored butterflies.</p><p>When they\u2019d finished dinner, Leif and his father cleared the table. Justine dealt with the leftovers and cleaned up the kitchen. Until recently, she hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d missed meal preparation; she\u2019d always assumed that cooking wasn\u2019t her forte. Her mother and grandmother were the ones who enjoyed working in the kitchen. Then she\u2019d married Seth and in those first few months while they renovated the old Captain\u2019s Galley and planned their new restaurant, Justine had taken pride in preparing their meals. She\u2019d gone to Olivia and Charlotte for recipes and ideas, and for the first time as an adult, she\u2019d connected with her mother in ways she never would\u2019ve thought possible. Her relationship with her grandmother, always good, grew even closer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI talked to my grandmother about recipes,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRecipes?\u201d Seth repeated, washing his hands. \u201cFor the tearoom?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve rediscovered how much I actually enjoy cooking.\u201d</p><p>Seth blinked. \u201cHold on a minute. You enjoy cooking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d She rolled her eyes at his feigned shock.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me this,\u201d her husband teased. \u201cExactly who was standing over a hot barbecue this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth Gunderson, flipping a few chicken breasts on the grill is not cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm not.\u201d He laughed, then caught Justine around the waist.</p><p>She laughed, too. Everything was going to be better now. In fact, it already was.</p><p>Four</p><p>Rachel Pendergast dumped a load of towels in the washer at the Get Nailed salon. Adding the soap, she closed the lid and turned the dial, waiting to be sure the water had started. She was taking advantage of a break between customers to deal with the laundry, a chore that needed to be done every day. When she left the small lunchroom she discovered her best friend, Teri, sitting in the chair at Rachel\u2019s station.</p><p>\u201cTeri!\u201d Rachel couldn\u2019t restrain her excitement. It\u2019d been less than a month since she\u2019d seen her but it felt longer. Not only did she miss Teri, but Nate, her navy boyfriend, had recently been transferred to San Diego.</p><p>Teri slid off the chair. She held her arms wide and they hugged and giggled like teenagers. The salon just wasn\u2019t the same without Teri\u2019s wisecracks and her caustic but funny view of life. Rachel had missed chatting with her about Nate. And Bruce.</p> <p>\u201cThank heaven you\u2019re back at work,\u201d Rachel cried. Looking Teri in the eye, she said, \u201cYou are back, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. I need to talk to Jane first.\u201d</p><p>Rachel was sure there wouldn\u2019t be any problem getting Teri on staff again. \u201cJane\u2019s at the bank. She\u2019ll return any minute.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t really understand why Bobby had insisted Teri leave her job. She knew there\u2019d been some kind of threat against Teri, although she assumed it actually had more to do with Bobby.</p><p>Two men had confronted Teri in the parking lot, and soon afterward, Bobby had asked her not to work at the salon until he got everything straightened out. Although Jane had hired a perfectly adequate replacement to fill in, the other woman wasn\u2019t Teri.</p><p>\u201cI finally managed to convince Bobby that either I went back to work or I\u2019d go insane,\u201d Teri explained, smiling over at Jeannie who was cutting a young woman\u2019s hair nearby.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Bobby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt home,\u201d Teri said. \u201cI love that man to distraction, but I couldn\u2019t stand his overprotectiveness.\u201d She paused, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cThe only way I could get him to agree was to promise I\u2019d have James drive me to and from work. James is supposed to be my bodyguard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJames?\u201d Rachel couldn\u2019t believe it. Bobby\u2019s driver was no bodyguard. First of all, he was as thin as a beanpole without any apparent muscle. If Teri found herself in danger, she\u2019d probably end up saving James.</p><p>\u201cSo, can you stay this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can until I talk to Jane, but after that I\u2019ll need to get back to the house. Otherwise, Bobby\u2019s likely to send out a search party.\u201d She laughed at her own joke. \u201cBobby isn\u2019t overjoyed about me working, but he understands that I like my job and want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s decided to be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I am, too,\u201d Teri said with a sigh of relief.</p><p>Rachel looked closely at her friend, struck by how lovely Teri was. She\u2019d always been impulsive, gregarious and outrageous. A little cynical, too, especially about men and relationships. And then she\u2019d met Bobby Polgar. She remained her larger-than-life self, but over the past few months she\u2019d changed. She\u2019d become...softer, Rachel thought. More hopeful, less cynical. And it was all due to Bobby.</p><p>Only love could explain the way two such dissimilar people had fallen for each other. A deep, true love, the kind that changed people for the better. The kind that offered acceptance and trust. Bobby came alive when he was with Teri. Anyone who\u2019d ever met him or seen him in front of a chessboard would acknowledge that he was a genius and a bit...she cast about for the right word...eccentric. With Teri, he became human\u2014likeable, and on occasion even funny. Although he usually didn\u2019t mean to be. He was simply naive in ways that were endearing.</p><p>Whether she and Nate had a love like Teri and Bobby\u2019s, she didn\u2019t know. She suspected they needed more time, and this enforced separation wasn\u2019t making their situation any easier.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Teri said, sitting down in the chair again and crossing her legs. \u201cBring me up to speed. You miss Nate?\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. \u201cA lot,\u201d she said, feeling bereft without him. Talking on the phone helped, but it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cHe calls me almost every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Bobby used to?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>Rachel laughed. \u201cNot quite. Nate phones when he can, and that\u2019s usually in the evenings.\u201d While courting Teri, Bobby had faithfully phoned at precisely the same hour every day, Pacific Standard Time, regardless of where he happened to be.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d Rachel asked, her voice sharper than she\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she returned vehemently. Bruce, a widower, had become a friend and his daughter, Jolene\u2014well, Jolene was special to her. In many ways Jolene reminded Rachel of herself as a girl. She, too, had lost her mother at an early age; she\u2019d been raised by an aunt who\u2019d died a few years ago. Jolene needed a female influence in her life, and that was the role Rachel played.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say no as if it\u2019s the most repugnant thought imaginable?\u201d Teri asked. \u201cYou make it sound like dating Bruce is something you could never even consider. We both know that isn\u2019t true. The two of you are just so well suited.\u201d</p><p>Rachel frowned. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Teri shook her head, implying it should be obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re already married. That\u2019s what anyone seeing you together would think if they didn\u2019t know better. You practically finish each other\u2019s sentences.\u201d</p><p>Rachel dismissed that observation with an airy wave of her hand. Teri was fond of Bruce, which made her partial to the idea of Rachel\u2019s being involved with him. \u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Teri cocked her head. \u201cHe\u2019s kissed you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel rolled her eyes. \u201cDo you have a hidden camera? Are you watching every move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Teri said. \u201cYou told me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, but it was a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriendly kiss,\u201d Teri finished for her.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d In retrospect, she thought Bruce might\u2019ve wanted it to be more. His kiss had come as a surprise, but as kisses went, it was nice. She mulled that over and decided nice was a weak description. Nice sounded so bland, like unsalted popcorn. That wasn\u2019t really how she\u2019d felt about it\u2014but maybe it was all she wanted to feel. \u201cI like Bruce, don\u2019t get me wrong, just not in that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember when I first started spending time with Jolene? Bruce made it abundantly clear that he had no interest in getting involved.\u201d She wasn\u2019t likely to forget the look on his face the day Jolene announced that she\u2019d chosen Rachel to be her new mother. Bruce had nearly swallowed his tongue. He\u2019d wanted it understood that he had no romantic intentions whatsoever. Rachel had taken him at his word. She simply didn\u2019t see him in those terms. Besides, she had a boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather talk about Nate,\u201d she said, preferring to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather discuss Bruce,\u201d Teri countered.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Teri shrugged. \u201cFor one thing, I find him more interesting than Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Rachel asked coldly\u2014knowing she shouldn\u2019t have responded at all.</p><p>\u201cWell, Bruce is down-to-earth and he doesn\u2019t have an inflated ego and...and he\u2019s a good dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jeannie said, entering uninvited into the conversation. She pointed her curling iron at Rachel as she stood behind her client. \u201cBruce called her the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see if Jolene could spend the night on Friday.\u201d Rachel wondered how her love life had become the business of the entire salon.</p><p>\u201cShe was on the line for a l-o-o-ong time,\u201d Jeannie told Teri, dragging out the word.</p><p>\u201cIt was my cell,\u201d Rachel explained, in case anyone thought she\u2019d been tying up the business line with a personal call.</p><p>\u201cYou did seem to be enjoying yourself. I heard you laughing.\u201d</p><p>Bruce was witty, or he could be. But Rachel ignored the comment. To acknowledge it would only invite further conversation and she was trying to avoid that.</p><p>\u201cWhenever she\u2019s on the phone with Nate,\u201d Jeannie went on to say, \u201cit\u2019s like she wants to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss Nate,\u201d Rachel said, throwing her hands in the air. \u201cWe\u2019re in love, and we have to be apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think you should pick Bruce,\u201d Jeannie said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take a poll?\u201d Teri suggested. She got up and turned in a complete circle, indicating that everyone in the salon should take part in the vote.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Rachel said, refusing to listen. Teri could organize her vote, but she wasn\u2019t sticking around to participate. It didn\u2019t matter what other people thought.</p><p>She was in love with Nate and had been from almost their first date, which she\u2019d bought at the Dog and Bachelor charity auction three summers ago. Okay, he was younger by five years, but that had never bothered him and it didn\u2019t bother her, either. What did concern her were his political connections; his father was a Pennsylvania congressman with higher political aspirations.</p><p>Then she\u2019d met his mother, and that hadn\u2019t gone well. Unfortunately, Nate had been oblivious to the verbal jabs the other woman had directed at her. He thought Rachel was imagining things, but she knew. Although Patrice Olsen didn\u2019t actually say so, she considered Rachel an inappropriate choice for her son.</p><p>Teri, who\u2019d obviously abandoned her plan to hold a runoff vote between Nate and Bruce, trailed her into the kitchen. Rachel had just slipped a frozen entr\u00e9e into the microwave. The washing machine churned nearby, and the sound of sloshing water punctuated her angry thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember what it was like when you met Bobby?\u201d Rachel said, whirling around to face her friend.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to fall in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A sigh escaped Teri\u2019s lips. \u201cBobby made it impossible not to. I\u2019ll never forget the night he brought me a dozen romantic greeting cards, flowers and about fifty pounds of expensive chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Bobby had been trying to romance Teri, and according to his \u201cresearch,\u201d that was the way to do it. Naturally, being Bobby, he\u2019d gone completely overboard.</p><p>\u201cHow could I turn him down when he asked if he could kiss me?\u201d Teri said plaintively.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t,\u201d Rachel agreed.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I say? The man swept me off my feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel about Bobby the way I feel about Nate,\u201d Rachel said and hoped Teri would leave it at that. All this talk about her and Bruce had unsettled her. She didn\u2019t want to think of Jolene\u2019s father as anything more than a friend.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d Teri said softly. \u201cYou forget I know you, Rachel, probably better than anyone else here. We\u2019ve been friends for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Rachel grew even more uncomfortable. She opened the microwave and took out her lunch. Steam rose from the entr\u00e9e as she gingerly lifted it onto a small plate and carried it to the two-person table.</p><p>\u201cI know Nate wants to marry you.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel had shared that information with Teri and regretted it now. \u201cYour point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is if you truly loved him, you wouldn\u2019t have hesitated. You would\u2019ve accepted his proposal, packed up your life and followed him to San Diego. You didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Teri, if you\u2019re gauging my feelings on that, you\u2019re completely off-base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped. Sitting down at the table, she reached for a napkin and smoothed it over her lap. \u201cWould you mind if we discussed something else now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She picked up the fork and sampled her first bite.</p><p>Jeannie stepped into the compact kitchen. \u201cListen, about Bruce Peyton\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rachel set down her fork with a clang, interrupting Jeannie\u2019s statement, whatever it was. She didn\u2019t want to hear his name again. If it wasn\u2019t Teri, it was some other friend or colleague. People just wouldn\u2019t let the subject drop and frankly she was bored with it. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d she asked with exaggerated patience.</p><p>Jeannie opened the small refrigerator and grabbed a bottle of cold water. \u201cA couple of my clients are hot to trot with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not hard on the eyes,\u201d Jeannie said, twisting off the cap and taking a deep swallow. \u201cThey\u2019ve been noticing him....\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for them,\u201d Rachel murmured, returning to her lunch. \u201cI hope it works out for him and whoever he\u2019s dating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s dating anyone,\u201d Jeannie told her.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d That wasn\u2019t actually true. Jolene kept her informed, and while Bruce did go out on occasion, those dates had never amounted to anything.</p><p>Jeannie left the lunchroom, but Teri stayed. After a moment, she gently pressed Rachel\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhen it\u2019s the right man, everything will be clear and you\u2019ll wonder why it took you so long to see what was already there in front of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it was with you and Bobby?\u201d she couldn\u2019t keep from asking.</p><p>A joyful smile softened Teri\u2019s face. \u201cI promised myself I wouldn\u2019t marry him. He had James deliver this huge diamond but I wasn\u2019t going to do it. I had absolutely no intention of marrying Bobby Polgar. Good grief, I hadn\u2019t even been to bed with him and here he was insisting I marry him.\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled at the memory of Teri\u2019s misery the night she\u2019d come to see her. Miserable and in love and so afraid she\u2019d ruin Bobby\u2019s life if she married him.</p><p>But Rachel could see, even then, that they were meant to be together. Bobby knew it, too, because he refused to let her go. Teri had figured it out fast enough; Rachel could only take hope from that.</p><p>Jane walked in just then, breaking into Rachel\u2019s musing. The happiness that lit her face when she saw Teri was all Rachel needed to know. Teri would be back at the salon where she belonged.</p><p>Five</p><p>Linnette McAfee\u2019s heart was broken. She\u2019d been in love for the first time in her life and it was over. Just like that. Over. Cal had gone off to rescue wild horses and while he was away, he\u2019d fallen in love with Vicki Newman, the local vet.</p><p>Linnette still couldn\u2019t understand how it had happened\u2014and yet, she could. It was her. Something was wrong with her. NotCal. Not Vicki. Her. Fresh tears filled her eyes as she indulged in this bout of self-pity.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and she jumped at the sound. The last thing she wanted now was company. It could only be one of two people\u2014her mother or her sister, Gloria\u2014and she wasn\u2019t in the mood to deal with either of them.</p><p>Everyone was angry with her because she\u2019d decided to leave Cedar Cove. Her friends at work, especially Chad Timmons, had said that if anyone left, it should be Cal. Well, he wasn\u2019t leaving, and Linnette didn\u2019t have it in her to watch Cal and Vicki together and pretend her heart wasn\u2019t broken. All right, she was overreacting. She was being overdramatic. But she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The doorbell chimed again, longer this time. She couldn\u2019t ignore it, so she wiped the tears from her cheeks and forced a smile. It crumpled the instant she saw her mother.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Corrie McAfee opened the screen door and stepped into the second-floor apartment. With comforting, cooing sounds, she put her arms around Linnette. \u201cOh honey, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Despite her efforts to be strong, Linnette buried her face in her mother\u2019s shoulder. Sometimes a girl needed her mother and Linnette wasn\u2019t too proud to admit it.</p><p>\u201cLet me make some tea,\u201d Corrie said, leading her into the kitchen.</p><p>While Linnette sat at the small table and pulled one tissue after another from the box, her mother set a kettle of water on the stove.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to leave before this,\u201d Linnette blubbered between hiccuping sobs. She wanted her mother to understand that she wasn\u2019t going to be talked out of moving. \u201cBut the clinic needs me until a replacement can be hired and trained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going to stay a bit longer, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Linnette didn\u2019t have any other choice. She couldn\u2019t let the clinic go short-staffed; she\u2019d worked there since it opened and the place meant a lot to her. But her job wasn\u2019t the only problem. She\u2019d signed a lease for the apartment and it was either pay the rent or find someone to sublet. That very day, she\u2019d posted an ad online and in the local paper. She\u2019d also talked to a rental agent. Unless she managed to get someone to take over the lease, she\u2019d have to stay much longer than she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stand to see you hurting like this,\u201d Corrie said, taking two mugs from the cupboard. \u201cThis is as hard on me as it is on you. I don\u2019t know what Cal was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom! Cal can love anyone he wants.\u201d Even after he\u2019d ended the relationship, she couldn\u2019t stop defending him. That was another reason she had to leave. Linnette still loved Cal, and because of that, she wanted him to be happy. If it meant he was with another woman, then...then she\u2019d simply leave.</p><p>The kettle whistled and steam shot into the air. Her mother removed it from the burner and poured the boiling water into the waiting pot, then added tea leaves. When she\u2019d finished, she carried the pot of steeping tea to the kitchen table.</p><p>Years ago, when Linnette was a schoolgirl, her mother had made tea for her whenever she was sick. But it wasn\u2019t the flu or a stomachache that bothered her now, and she seriously doubted a cup of tea would ease her aching heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to put my things in storage,\u201d Linnette said. She\u2019d been considering what to do with her furniture for some time. Not that she had much to store. At first she\u2019d assumed she could keep her belongings in her parents\u2019 basement, but then she realized it was her responsibility, not her parents\u2019.</p><p>\u201cDad and I can keep them for you,\u201d her mother offered, exactly as Linnette had known she would.</p><p>\u201cNo, Mom, this is what I\u2019m doing.\u201d It would be easy to let her mother talk her out of her plans. The whole process would start with something small, some favor like the one she\u2019d just suggested, and then gradually, Corrie would wear her down. Next thing she knew, Linnette would be staying in Cedar Cove.</p><p>Her mother seemed surprised by Linnette\u2019s persistence and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Linnette reiterated.</p><p>Corrie reached for the teapot and filled both their cups, muttering, \u201cIt\u2019s a waste of good money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...\u201d Corrie tensed. \u201cWhere do you plan to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Linnette said noncommittally.</p><p>This news appeared to startle her mother. \u201cYou mean to say you\u2019re just heading out the door with no destination in mind?\u201d</p><p>Linnette nodded. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so unlike you.\u201d Corrie looked even more distressed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mom, but...\u201d Linnette didn\u2019t know how to finish her response; she had nothing reassuring to say.</p><p>Her mother was right. Acting this impulsively was unlike her. She craved structure, needed it. Once she\u2019d decided to become a Physician Assistant, she\u2019d listed all the required courses, and calculated how long it would take to obtain her degree. Then, with the full force of her determination, she\u2019d set out to achieve it. Never before, not on a trip or in life, had she left without a road map. Until now.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re running away,\u201d her mother said anxiously.</p><p>Linnette had no intention of denying it. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d She took a sip of tea and not surprisingly it burned her mouth. She set down the mug.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s not a rational decision, Mom. I\u2019m responding to pain. I\u2019m fully aware that none of this makes sense to you or anyone else. All I can tell you is that leaving feels right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal should move,\u201d Corrie said in a stubborn voice.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have family here and you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has to move anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m the one who wants to get out of Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go,\u201d her mother said. \u201cBut don\u2019t do it like this,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cRequest a leave of absence from work. Take however long you need. But to quit like this, pack up your belongings and move out of your apartment, it\u2019s so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrastic?\u201d Linnette inserted.</p><p>\u201cYes, drastic,\u201d her mother agreed. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you feel the need to flee like this with...with your tail between your legs. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCal and Vicki didn\u2019t either. I\u2019m walking away because I\u2019m the one who\u2019s hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd therefore the one least qualified to be making this kind of decision,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cMother, don\u2019t you see...\u201d Linnette began. She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to do something that\u2019s more...out of my comfort zone. My life is so regimented, so...so, I don\u2019t know, so perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re looking for a way to screw it up?\u201d</p> <p>That made Linnette smile. \u201cNo. I\u2019m looking for a way to escape. I\u2019m seeking adventure,\u201d she said grandly.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve always been so responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly my point,\u201d Linnette told her. \u201cI\u2019m tired of meeting all these expectations.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYour father and I never meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Linnette leaned across the table and placed a hand on her mother\u2019s arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not your expectations I\u2019m talking about but my own. I\u2019m the one who put them on myself. As of right now, I\u2019m taking a long, hard look at my life. I\u2019m setting out to discover what I really want. All I know is that it isn\u2019t in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother seemed about to break into tears. \u201cAnd you have to run away from your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was the simple, straightforward truth.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Corrie picked up her tea and her lips trembled as she bent to take a sip.</p><p>Linnette understood how difficult this was for her mother. \u201cThink about the positive side, Mom,\u201d she said, forcing a note of cheerful optimism into her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s positive about my daughter running away?\u201d Corrie asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, this\u2019ll be a wonderful opportunity for you and Gloria to get to know each other without me there always directing the conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother\u2019s eyes widened. The situation with Gloria remained awkward, although everyone was trying to make her feel like part of the family. Gloria had been given up for adoption as an infant and then found her biological family. She was a full-blooded sister Linnette had never known she had\u2014or at least not until two years ago.</p><p>A little while before that, Linnette had moved practically next door to her own sister and they\u2019d struck up a friendship. Gloria had been a tremendous comfort to Linnette since her breakup with Cal.</p><p>\u201cI love you both equally,\u201d her mother said in low tones. \u201cI always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do, Mom, but you don\u2019t really know Gloria. Like I said, this is your chance to bond without me being there.\u201d So far, it\u2019d always been the three of them. Now, both Gloria and their mother could benefit from some private time together. Without Linnette who, as she readily acknowledged, tended to be the center of attention.</p><p>She finished her tea and, feeling a little stronger\u2014perhaps the tea had helped\u2014she brought her cup to the sink. Her mother stood, too. \u201cI should go. Your father expected me back at the office half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised that he didn\u2019t call your cell.\u201d</p><p>Corrie smiled. \u201cI suspect he knew where I was.\u201d</p><p>She was probably right. Linnette admired her parents\u2019 marriage and the way they understood each other, the way they worked together. It was what she wanted for her own marriage and was determined to have one day.</p> <p>Her mother left soon afterward. Linnette hugged her, and they both managed to smile, despite Corrie\u2019s disappointment. Everything she\u2019d said was true, and yet nothing was going to change. Linnette instinctively knew she\u2019d made the right decision. She needed to leave Cedar Cove.</p><p>She rinsed out the cups and set them in the dishwasher. She\u2019d just returned to her packing when the doorbell rang again. It would be either her brother, Mack, or Gloria, she figured. Most likely Gloria.</p><p>But Linnette was in for a shock. Vicki Newman, the woman Cal loved, stood on the other side of the screen door. For a long moment the two women did nothing but stare at each other.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019ve come,\u201d Vicki said shyly, her brown eyes imploring Linnette.</p><p>\u201cDoes Cal know you\u2019re here?\u201d Linnette couldn\u2019t help glancing over the woman\u2019s shoulder. Then she looked back at Vicki, with her plain face\u2014there was no other word for it\u2014and her carelessly braided hair. And yet Linnette had begun to realize why Cal loved her so much. For one thing they shared a view of the world, including their passion for animals; Vicki was a veterinarian and Cal a horse-trainer who worked for Grace Harding\u2019s husband. The way it had all happened, though\u2014Linnette still found that hard to believe. But she respected him for caring so deeply that he was willing to stand up to the barrage of criticism directed at him because of the pain he\u2019d caused Linnette.</p><p>In response to Linnette\u2019s question, Vicki shook her head. \u201cCal wouldn\u2019t like it if he found out I\u2019d stopped by.\u201d</p><p>Knowing him as well as she did, Linnette agreed. Unlatching the screen door, she pushed it open to allow the other woman inside.</p><p>As Vicki walked into the apartment, her gaze darted about the room, taking in the boxes that littered the floor. \u201cSo it\u2019s true. You are moving.\u201d</p><p>Linnette ignored her comment and gestured toward the sofa. \u201cWould you like to sit down?\u201d</p><p>Vicki declined with a shake of her head. She gazed down at the carpet. \u201cI heard you were leaving, and I just wanted to tell you how...how sorry I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry that I\u2019m leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...sorry that I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Vicki looked up then and seemed to reach some decision. \u201cI\u2019ve been in love with Cal for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cLong before he met you. He didn\u2019t know it and I...I didn\u2019t know how to tell him, so I said nothing. I never thought he could possibly love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of Cal that you volunteered to help with the mustang rescue, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Vicki nodded. \u201cWell...partly. The cause is important to me too, of course. Anything to do with horses...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d After a brief silence, she asked, \u201cYou knew about me?\u201d</p><p>Vicki nodded again. \u201cI tried not to love him.\u201d</p><p>Linnette wasn\u2019t sure of the other woman\u2019s purpose in confronting her. Perhaps she felt guilty. Perhaps because of that she was hoping Linnette would yell at her, curse her, condemn her for taking the man Linnette loved. A week earlier, that was exactly what might have happened. Not now. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s trying not to love him,\u201d Linnette whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be lots of other opportunities for you. You\u2019ll find someone else to love\u2014someone who\u2019ll love you,\u201d Vicki said urgently. \u201cBut for me...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cI communicate better with animals than I do with people. I always have. As soon as I met Cal, I felt we should be together. He has the same feeling about animals.\u201d</p><p>Linnette suddenly had a sharp clear memory of the time she\u2019d come to visit Cal and overheard him crooning to an injured horse. He hadn\u2019t known she was there. Linnette had felt as if she was intruding on a private moment, a private world.</p><p>\u201cCal\u2019s asked me to marry him,\u201d Vicki said in a low voice. \u201cI want to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should,\u201d Linnette said.</p><p>\u201cWe both feel so guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, please.\u201d She reached out to touch Vicki\u2019s arm. In the beginning she\u2019d hated this woman, but she no longer felt that way. \u201cI want you both to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that?\u201d Vicki asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWith all my heart.\u201d Linnette took a deep breath. \u201cIf you\u2019ve come looking for my absolution, then you have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I tell Cal we\u2019ve talked?\u201d</p><p>Linnette nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right, you know. I will find someone else.\u201d For the first time she actually believed it.</p><p>Six</p><p>It was the Saturday evening of the dreaded family dinner.</p><p>Teri couldn\u2019t stop fidgeting. She checked the ham roasting in the oven, along with a huge casserole of scalloped potatoes. She\u2019d chosen fresh green beans for the vegetable; they were simmering on the stove. Although it was summer, ham had always been served on special occasions, and Teri wasn\u2019t about to break with tradition. The table was set with her formal dishes\u2014even the concept of \u201cformal\u201d and \u201ceveryday\u201d dishes was a new one for her\u2014and sparkling crystal glasses. Nothing but the best for Mom, Christie and the gang, she thought with no small degree of irony. Against her better judgment, Teri was introducing her family, such as it was, to her husband.</p><p>\u201cBobby,\u201d she called, leaving the kitchen and pulling off the apron she\u2019d donned to protect her pale-green shirt. She\u2019d worn it for confidence, since Bobby loved that color on her. When he came toward her, she drew in a calming breath. \u201cRemember what I told you?\u201d</p><p>Her husband regarded her blankly.</p><p>\u201cAbout Christie.\u201d</p><p>Judging by the blank look he gave her, he didn\u2019t recall a word. She\u2019d wanted to warn him so he\u2019d be prepared. Her sister, slim and lovely, would do everything in her power to attract him\u2014and steal him away if she could.</p><p>Teri suspected that Christie had coerced Johnny into arranging this meeting just so she could prove yet again that any man would prefer her. Christie was thinner, prettier, sexier, and she made sure Teri knew it. Not for a minute did Teri discount her sister\u2019s charms.</p><p>She sighed at Johnny\u2019s naivet\u00e9. She didn\u2019t really blame him for engineering this...this fiasco-to-be; her little brother desperately wanted them all to live in peace and harmony\u2014as though they actually liked each other.</p><p>She sighed again. \u201cMy family will be here any minute.\u201d</p><p>Bobby stared back at her, then slowly smiled. \u201cI love you, remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who needs to be reminded.\u201d Christie could be subtle while she was busy flattering some unsuspecting man. She\u2019d be completely absorbed in Bobby, hang on his every word. He\u2019d fall for it, too, she thought grimly. It seemed that every guy she\u2019d loved had been lured away by her sister. Whenever Christie met any man in Teri\u2019s life, he was no longer interested in her. Even if Christie had a boyfriend at the time, she had to take her sister\u2019s, too.</p><p>No one had mattered to Teri as much as Bobby. If Christie assumed she could waltz into Teri\u2019s home and play her games, then her little sister had a real surprise awaiting her.</p><p>\u201cTell me their names again,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s name is Ruth and her husband, my stepfather, is Donald.\u201d Teri had to stop and think. \u201cNo, sorry, Johnny phoned and told me Mom\u2019s left Donald and now she\u2019s planning to marry Mike. I haven\u2019t met him yet.\u201d She shook her head. Out of seven men, Ruth had yet to pick a decent one as far as Teri could tell, and she doubted Mike would be the exception.</p><p>\u201cRuth and Mike,\u201d Bobby dutifully repeated. \u201cAnd your sister\u2019s Christie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cChristie Levitt.\u201d She bit out the name, hoping she didn\u2019t sound as angry as she felt.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI told Mom we wouldn\u2019t be serving any alcohol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Bobby studied her.</p> <p>Bobby could be completely oblivious to what was going on around him\u2014the time of day, the weather, even what month it was. However, when it came to Teri, he seemed to notice more than she sometimes realized.</p><p>\u201cIs your sister like you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Now, that was an interesting question. Christie wasn\u2019t like her, and yet she was. Two years younger, Christie had tagged after her for the first twelve years of Teri\u2019s life. Anything Teri had, Christie wanted\u2014and generally got. Teri could say without hesitation that their mother had always favored her younger daughter. And yet Christie was capable of kindness on occasion, which Teri found all too easy to forget. She knew enough about human nature to understand that she and Christie shared an insecurity that probably stemmed from their mother\u2019s selfishness and neglect. Ruth might have preferred Christie and spoiled her but both girls had suffered. They just expressed their insecurity with contrasting kinds of behavior.</p><p>\u201cWell, in some ways Christie and I are alike,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you afraid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConcerned,\u201d she said. She had to learn to trust her husband. The biggest test would come this very evening, and she\u2019d know once and for all if Bobby truly loved her.</p><p>\u201cDoes Donald play chess?\u201d he asked next.</p><p>\u201cMike,\u201d she corrected. This time around, her mother hadn\u2019t bothered to introduce the new man in her life. Well, for that matter, Teri hadn\u2019t introduced Bobby, either\u2014but for entirely different reasons.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mike play chess?\u201d He revised the question.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Teri loved Bobby all the more for asking. He wasn\u2019t comfortable in social situations and didn\u2019t handle them well. For the most part he avoided even small gatherings; they tended to overwhelm him.</p><p>The doorbell chimed, and Teri felt herself tense. \u201cThis is going to be a perfect dinner,\u201d she said aloud. Maybe voicing the words would make it happen, although she was pretty sure she sounded more sarcastic than hopeful. The last time the entire family had been together was two Christmases ago, and it\u2019d been an unmitigated disaster.</p> <p>Ruth and Donald were already drunk and in the middle of a pointless argument when Teri arrived for Christmas dinner. Johnny was late and their sister had left in a fit of anger, furious over something trivial. Teri was stuck refereeing between her mother and her worthless husband.</p><p>She\u2019d done her best to be festive and cheerful, and all she got in return was anger and resentment. No one else, apparently, was interested in celebrating anything. Because she\u2019d wanted to see Johnny, she\u2019d waited until he got there; she\u2019d spent an hour talking to him, then went home, glad to make her escape. That year, she\u2019d spent the rest of Christmas Day propped up in bed with a good book and a large chocolate bar. She\u2019d felt guilty about abandoning Johnny to their lunatic family, but she couldn\u2019t have been happier to get away. Yet, here she was, willing to try all over again.</p><p>When she opened the door, Christie stood on the other side. Teri should\u2019ve known her half sister would show up right on time. She looked awestruck\u2014and envious. The house was impressive, Teri had to admit.</p><p>\u201cSome digs you\u2019ve got here,\u201d Christie said. \u201cMom and Mike are parking the car and they\u2019re going to have a smoke before they come in.\u201d Her gaze immediately shot past Teri and flew to Bobby.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she cooed and practically shoved past Teri in order to greet Bobby. \u201cI\u2019m Christie.\u201d She held out her hand, and when Bobby moved to shake it, she deftly slipped into his arms for a gentle hug. \u201cWe\u2019re family, after all,\u201d she said, smiling up at him with undisguised admiration.</p><p>Bobby extricated himself and stood beside Teri, resting his hand on her shoulder. \u201cBobby Polgar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all about you,\u201d Christie told him. \u201cI read your story on the Internet. You\u2019re, like, the most popular checkers player in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess,\u201d Teri muttered. Reaching for her husband\u2019s hand, she gave it a squeeze. \u201cBobby plays chess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her sister\u2019s face fell. \u201cWell, I remembered it was one of those board games.\u201d</p><p>Unlike Teri, her sister was tall with curves in all the right places, and she knew how to use them. Her blouse was cut low in the front, displaying an almost indecent amount of cleavage. Bobby, bless his heart, didn\u2019t seem to notice.</p><p>\u201cShall we sit down?\u201d Teri suggested. Dinner was ready, so there was nothing to distract her in the kitchen. The last thing Teri intended to do was give her sister time alone with Bobby.</p><p>They walked slowly into the living room, then sat and stared at each other. They were like aliens from different planets meeting to negotiate a peace settlement\u2014like on Star Trek, Teri thought. Except there was no Captain Picard to guide them. Silently Teri pleaded with Bobby to say something. Anything. He cast her a helpless look in response.</p><p>Teri clutched his hand as if it were a lifeline that connected her to the mother ship as she drifted around outer space.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised my sister caught such a handsome man,\u201d Christie said in a bright voice.</p><p>\u201cSurprised?\u201d Teri repeated, gritting her teeth.</p><p>\u201cHandsome?\u201d Bobby repeated at the same time.</p><p>Teri glared at him. Not Bobby, too. Her heart sank.</p><p>\u201cHandsome and rich and famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband the checkers player.\u201d Teri stared up at Bobby with an exaggerated starstruck expression. For further effect, she batted her eyelashes.</p><p>Bobby looked uncomfortable and confused.</p><p>Christie laughed softly. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re worried that I\u2019d try to lure Bobby away from you. My goodness, Teri, are you really that insecure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I.\u201d She hated to admit that she was\u2014that they both were. Her sister\u2019s need to compete, to win, brought out the very worst in Teri, especially when there was a man involved. Christie knew her deepest fears and manipulated them. And Teri allowed her to do it. That was a pattern she recognized but couldn\u2019t explain. Maybe it was simply habit, all those years of playing certain roles, feeling certain emotions.</p><p>Christie hadn\u2019t been in the house two minutes and already Teri hated her\u2014and hated herself.</p><p>Clearing her throat, she decided then and there that she wouldn\u2019t play the role Christie always assigned her. The loser. The unattractive one. The rejected woman. \u201cYou can try all you want,\u201d she said with a look of unconcern. \u201cMy husband loves me, and I trust him. So go ahead, little sister. But it isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>Christie blinked, obviously taken aback by Teri\u2019s directness.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do just that,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p><p>Rather than watch, Teri excused herself to check on their dinner. She\u2019d made her stand and now she had to step back and trust her heart\u2014and her husband. Finding busywork in the kitchen, she gave Christie ten full minutes.</p><p>When Teri returned, Christie seemed more than a little befuddled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any beer?\u201d her sister asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to have alcohol around when Mom\u2019s going to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use one.\u201d</p><p>Teri caught her husband\u2019s eye and, to her utter astonishment, Bobby winked. Teri grinned and so did he. Bobby knew\u2014and he\u2019d put Christie in her place. Teri had no idea what had gone on while she was in the kitchen. But in that moment all she wanted to do was throw herself at her husband and make love to him, regardless of who was in the room.</p><p>Her husband recognized her look, and his eyes briefly flared. They shared a smile and an unspoken promise. He\u2019d get his reward later.</p><p>Teri\u2019s mother and Mike showed up next. As soon as her mother walked inside, she oohed and aahed over the house. After introductions were exchanged, she turned to her older daughter. \u201cTeri, this is just lovely. Give me a tour, would you? I want to see every room.\u201d She brought one hand to her throat as she roamed from living room to kitchen to dining room, commenting on each feature. Like an obedient puppy, Mike silently trailed behind.</p><p>\u201cTeri\u2019s got the bucks now and she can flaunt it,\u201d Christie said. The words had a deflated quality that Teri chose to ignore.</p><p>Johnny arrived last and a genuine smile lit up his face when he saw Teri. He immediately hugged her and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Her mother left to go to the car and returned with a case of beer. \u201cThis is Mike\u2019s and my contribution to dinner,\u201d she said, setting it down on the kitchen counter. Before Teri could protest, Christie had pulled out a bottle, twisted off the cap and taken her first swig. Ruth and Mike followed in quick succession.</p><p>Johnny met her eyes and shrugged. There was nothing either of them could do now.</p><p>The evening deteriorated from that point on. Ruth and Mike, along with Christie, sat in the living room and drank beer while Teri served appetizers they mostly ignored. Bobby and Johnny gamely swallowed cheese puffs and shrimp.</p><p>\u201cI baked a ham,\u201d Teri announced. Bobby got up and stood behind her, as if protecting her from harm.</p><p>\u201cI hope everyone\u2019s hungry,\u201d Johnny added, joining them. \u201cLooks like Teri\u2019s been cooking all day.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d taken real pride in this dinner, but that was beside the point. She smiled gratefully at her brother.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like she\u2019s been eating all day, too,\u201d her mother said, and seemed to find herself exceptionally funny.</p><p>One hand on her hip, Teri said, \u201cNo more beer for you, understand?\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s head came back as though she\u2019d been struck. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said this is my house and if you want to drink, you\u2019ll do it elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I will.\u201d She stood and the still-silent Mike stood with her.</p><p>Although she\u2019d threatened to leave, Ruth didn\u2019t seem to be in any rush. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so smart because you\u2019re married to this hotshot checkers player,\u201d her mother spat. \u201cJust because you\u2019ve got money doesn\u2019t mean you can tell people how to run their lives.\u201d</p><p>Everyone froze, and then Bobby stepped forward. Without saying a word, he picked up Ruth\u2019s handbag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing with my purse?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Marching into the entry, Bobby set her mother\u2019s purse down by the front door.</p><p>\u201cAre you kicking me out?\u201d Ruth cried. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this! My own daughter\u2019s asking me to leave her home.\u201d She glanced around the room, seeking support and finding none. Then she headed toward Mike, grabbing his arm.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you were leaving anyway,\u201d Christie commented.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Mom,\u201d Johnny said cheerfully as he held open the front door. \u201cYou drink, you go. That\u2019s Teri\u2019s rule.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruth hesitated in the doorway. \u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m going to forget this, Teri. One day you\u2019ll need me, but I\u2019ll tell you right now\u2014you can forget it.\u201d With her chin so high she was in danger of tripping over her own two feet, Ruth walked out with Mike once again trudging obediently in her wake.</p><p>There was a startled silence. Teri felt like weeping; she\u2019d known something like this would happen, although she\u2019d suspected Christie rather than her mother would cause the scene.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to leave, too?\u201d Teri turned to ask her sister.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Christie hiccuped. It was obvious that she\u2019d already had too much to drink. A glint of admiration shone in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you stand up to Mom that way,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI wish I had the guts to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Teri blinked, hardly able to believe what she\u2019d just heard. She\u2019d actually confronted their mother any number of times. Apparently Christie hadn\u2019t been around to witness it\u2014probably too busy dating one of Teri\u2019s old boyfriends.</p><p>\u201cWe should all sit down and eat,\u201d Johnny said after a moment. \u201cIt\u2019d be a shame to let a perfectly good dinner go to waste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p>To her surprise, the meal went smoothly. Without complaint, Christie switched from beer to tap water. The two of them talked in an unusually friendly fashion. Comfortable with each other, Johnny and Bobby chatted about chess, cars and Star Trek. Bobby was polite toward Christie but conveyed in unmistakable terms that he wouldn\u2019t be swayed by her many charms.</p><p>\u201cWould anyone like dessert?\u201d Teri asked, her mood hovering close to joyous. She\u2019d always known that she\u2019d married a wonderful man, but he was even more wonderful than she\u2019d realized. Every time she thought about the matter-of-fact way he\u2019d delivered her mother\u2019s purse to the front door, it warmed her heart. Bobby wasn\u2019t about to let anyone insult his wife. He hadn\u2019t spoken a single word, but his message was clear. She couldn\u2019t wait to show him her love and gratitude, and from the gleam in his eyes, Bobby knew exactly how she intended to do that.</p> <p>Christie must have noticed the look they\u2019d shared because she followed Teri into the kitchen. \u201cHe loves you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d Teri started to load the plates into the dishwasher. \u201cNo man\u2019s ever loved me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in a bar,\u201d Teri said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that.\u201d Christie rinsed off the dishes and handed them to Teri.</p><p>Teri couldn\u2019t remember ever working side by side with her sister before. Not as an adult, at any rate.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a decent guy, you know,\u201d Christie said thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m not likely to meet someone like him.\u201d</p><p>Teri had to agree that she\u2019d been fortunate. \u201cDon\u2019t be so sure,\u201d she told her sister. \u201cThink positive.\u201d</p><p>Christie snickered. \u201cA lot of good that\u2019ll do me.\u201d</p><p>Teri made a pot of coffee while Christie sliced the homemade coconut cake. Together they carried dessert into the dining room.</p><p>Half an hour later, Johnny prepared to leave for Seattle. He hugged both of his sisters and as he walked out, he gave Teri a thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll drive you home,\u201d Bobby said when Christie told them it was time for her to leave as well.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Christie insisted. \u201cI\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>Bobby wouldn\u2019t hear of it. \u201cJames is outside waiting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJames?\u201d Christie asked, glancing at Teri for an answer.</p><p>\u201cJames Wilbur, Bobby\u2019s personal driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Christie struggled with little success to hide a smile. \u201cI guess that would be all right.\u201d</p><p>Teri and Bobby escorted her to the vehicle. James, looking distinguished as usual, stood by the passenger door, waiting to open it for her.</p><p>\u201cLa-di-da,\u201d Christie said, clearly impressed. She inclined her head. \u201cThank you, James.\u201d Giggling, she gestured regally. \u201cHome, James.\u201d</p><p>Without cracking a smile, James held the door and Christie slid inside. As soon as she was seated, she lowered the tinted window. \u201cWow, this is really something.\u201d She sounded about ten years old, and Teri was touched by this glimpse of a more innocent Christie.</p><p>\u201cCome and visit us again,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Christie promised. Then, with an exaggerated flourish, she pressed the button to raise the window.</p><p>When James pulled onto the drive, Teri leaned against her husband. \u201cThat was nice of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It was just like him to acknowledge his own generosity. But then\u2014why shouldn\u2019t he? \u201cSo,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you think of my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Johnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Christie.\u201d</p><p>Her defenses immediately went on alert. \u201cYou...like...Christie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but it\u2019s you I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent answer, Mr. Polgar.\u201d</p><p>Bobby chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m tired. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Teri knew it wasn\u2019t sleeping he had in mind. \u201cIt\u2019s too early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s two or three hours later than I would\u2019ve liked.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, Teri Polgar loved her husband. At least as much as he loved her....</p><p>Seven</p><p>Grace Sherman Harding cradled the sleeping infant in her arms. The overwhelming love she felt for this tiny being was almost more than a single heart could hold. This was her new grandson: Drake Joseph Bowman. She smiled; that was quite a handle for such a small baby.</p><p>She\u2019d experienced the same sense of wonder when she\u2019d held Tyler and Katie as newborns.</p><p>\u201cIs he still sleeping?\u201d Maryellen asked, bringing two glasses of lemonade into the living room.</p><p>\u201cOh, Maryellen, he\u2019s so precious.\u201d This had been a difficult pregnancy for her daughter. Maryellen had spent the last five months bedridden. Both Grace and Cliff had done what they could to help, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Thankfully, Jon\u2019s parents had come from Oregon and were able to visit every day; otherwise, Grace didn\u2019t know how Maryellen and Jon would\u2019ve managed. Not with a three-year-old underfoot and Jon working all hours to support his family.</p><p>\u201cDrake was worth every second of discomfort,\u201d Maryellen said.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Katie doing?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Maryellen sat down on the sofa opposite Grace\u2019s chair. \u201cShe\u2019s enthralled with being a big sister. Jon and I were afraid she\u2019d show signs of jealousy. But so far, she hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The baby\u2019s eyes fluttered open and he stared up at Grace. Some might say she was imagining things, but she was sure he\u2019d smiled at her. Grace smiled back. \u201cHello, handsome boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see he\u2019s awake and I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s hungry,\u201d Maryellen said. \u201cHe probably needs a diaper change, too.\u201d She reached for her son, and Grace watched as Maryellen changed him out of a soggy diaper into a fresh one.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Kelly doing?\u201d Maryellen asked when she\u2019d finished.</p><p>Grace\u2019s younger daughter was due in the next two weeks.</p><p>\u201cShe envies you,\u201d Grace said wryly. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely ready for this baby to be born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last two weeks of this pregnancy were the longest of my life,\u201d Maryellen said as she nestled her son to her breast.</p><p>It was a joy to see her daughter this content. Suddenly Grace felt an intense sadness that took her completely by surprise. Dan was missing so much. Her first husband had been dead for six years now. After his disappearance, Grace had met Cliff Harding; once Dan\u2019s body was recovered\u2014with his suicide note\u2014she\u2019d allowed herself to find happiness in loving Cliff. Earlier that year, she\u2019d finally married him.</p><p>When Dan had first gone missing, Grace had been sure she\u2019d never feel contentment again. She didn\u2019t sleep, didn\u2019t eat and was scarcely able to function. Only recently had she begun to understand the kinds of demons that had chased her husband and compelled him into such a drastic solution.</p><p>Kelly had always been close to her father, and his disappearance had been hardest on her. She\u2019d been pregnant with Tyler at the time, utterly convinced her father would return for the birth of his first grandchild. Until the very end, Kelly had believed Dan would have a perfectly rational explanation for disappearing.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Maryellen said. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled despite her sadness. \u201cI was thinking about your father and how proud he would\u2019ve been of his grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen looked away and, when she turned back, her eyes brimmed with tears. \u201cI think about Dad a lot. I miss him. I didn\u2019t expect I would.... I was so furious with him for what he did. Now...now I\u2019m not. I just feel so sad for him and what he\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>Grace leaned forward. \u201cI miss him, too. We\u2019ll never fully understand why he chose suicide, and there\u2019s no point in trying to find a logical reason. He wasn\u2019t himself.\u201d And hadn\u2019t been for years, she thought but didn\u2019t say.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Grace heard sounds from upstairs indicating that Katie had awakened from her nap. \u201cI\u2019ll get her,\u201d she told Maryellen, wiping the tears from her own cheeks as she walked up the stairs to collect her granddaughter.</p><p>Still tired and a little cranky, Katie crawled into her grandmother\u2019s arms and pressed her cheek against Grace\u2019s shoulder. Moving carefully on the steps, Grace carried her granddaughter back to the living room. She settled down on the sofa again and held Katie close.</p><p>\u201cI heard the art gallery isn\u2019t doing so well,\u201d Maryellen said. She met her mother\u2019s gaze. \u201cLois phoned the other day and said sales are way down.\u201d</p><p>Lois Habbersmith had taken over as manager when Maryellen had to quit. Grace knew that Maryellen had always had reservations about Lois\u2019s ability to cope with the job\u2019s responsibilities. Her daughter\u2019s instincts had proved to be right. Lois was overwhelmed, and the gallery seemed to be suffering. Grace hated to see all of Maryellen\u2019s hard work erode.</p><p>It was at the gallery that her daughter had met Jon Bowman. What a blessing he\u2019d been to Maryellen\u2014to the whole family.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s talk that the gallery might have to close,\u201d Maryellen murmured. Grace recognized frustration as well as sadness in her daughter\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a real pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too, but I can\u2019t go back to work.\u201d Maryellen sighed. \u201cI\u2019d like to, but it\u2019s impossible. Besides, I\u2019m managing Jon\u2019s career now. With two children under four, plus getting Jon\u2019s photographs out to the various agents, I have all I can deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThe gallery\u2019s not your obligation anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I put so much time and energy into the place,\u201d Maryellen said regretfully. \u201cIt really bothers me to see it failing. I\u2019m positive that, given half a chance, it could be profitable again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace believed that, too. None of the artists her daughter had worked with depended on income from The Harbor Street Gallery as their sole support. But sales there had supplemented many of the local artists\u2019 revenue, including Jon\u2019s.</p><p>Katie squirmed down from her lap, and Grace took her into the kitchen to let the little girl choose her own afternoon snack. Katie decided on a graham cracker and juice.</p><p>When she returned, Maryellen had finished nursing Drake. \u201cOlivia came by yesterday with a gift for the baby.\u201d</p><p>Olivia and Grace had been best friends nearly their entire lives. Before Grace could comment, her daughter continued. \u201cShe said something interesting.\u201d Maryellen studied her closely.</p> <p>Grace had a feeling she already knew what this was about. \u201cDoes it have to do with Will Jefferson?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded.</p><p>Slowly expelling her breath, Grace sat down. Will was Olivia\u2019s older brother. In high school Grace had a huge crush on Will, but he\u2019d hardly known she was alive. He\u2019d gone off to college, married and moved to Atlanta. She\u2019d married Dan and stayed in Cedar Cove.</p><p>Decades later, after Dan\u2019s death, Will had contacted Grace to tell her how sorry he was. Their e-mail relationship had started out innocently enough. Then it turned into an affair in every sense but the physical\u2014and that would\u2019ve happened within a matter of weeks. Grace wasn\u2019t blameless by any means; she knew Will was married. He\u2019d lied, though, and said he was divorcing his wife, Georgia. Because she so badly wanted to believe him, she\u2019d agreed to meet him in New Orleans, where they planned to share a hotel room. She was mortified when she\u2019d learned, quite by accident, that Will had no intention of leaving his wife\u2014for her or for any other reason. Fortunately, she\u2019d found out before she went to Louisiana.</p><p>That betrayal had nearly destroyed Grace\u2019s relationship with Cliff Harding. Over time, he\u2019d forgiven her for the pain she\u2019d brought him. Now she considered herself the luckiest woman in the world to be his wife.</p> <p>\u201cOlivia told me he\u2019s divorced\u2014and that he\u2019s moving back to Cedar Cove,\u201d Maryellen said, still studying Grace.</p><p>\u201cI heard he might do that,\u201d she said through numb lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d Maryellen demanded.</p><p>Grace could only shrug. Apparently, seeing other women was nothing new to Olivia\u2019s brother. Grace wasn\u2019t his first indiscretion and she wasn\u2019t his last. Finally Georgia had had enough and filed for divorce. Now, after nearly forty years of marriage, she wanted out.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to see him, are you?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>Grace shook her head adamantly. \u201cNot if I can help it.\u201d In fact, she intended to do whatever she could to avoid Will Jefferson. The problem was, he hadn\u2019t taken her rejection lightly.</p> <p>He\u2019d come to Cedar Cove once before, hoping to talk his way around his lies and her objections. There\u2019d been an ugly incident, and Cliff had become involved. Just remembering it made Grace want to bury her face in her hands. Until Will had reentered her life, she hadn\u2019t realized how quickly she could lower her principles or how stupid she could be when it came to love. Or, more accurately, infatuation.</p><p>\u201cDoes Cliff know?\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head again. She should tell him. That went without saying, but even while she acknowledged it, Grace told herself she wasn\u2019t quite ready. She\u2019d do it, of course. Just not yet. The time wasn\u2019t right.</p><p>Getting past how she\u2019d misled Cliff\u2014no, how she\u2019d lied to him\u2014had been a major hurdle in their relationship. Unfortunately, his first wife had cheated on him, so Cliff recognized all the signs. He\u2019d heard the excuses. This was a path he wasn\u2019t walking twice. It\u2019d taken Grace months to prove herself to him. Now she was unwilling to put her marriage at risk over a man who meant absolutely nothing to her. His lies had destroyed any feeling she\u2019d had.</p><p>The sound of a car coming into the driveway interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDaddy\u2019s home,\u201d Maryellen announced for Katie\u2019s benefit.</p><p>Scrambling out of her chair, Katie ran toward the door, her face lit up with joy. \u201cDaddy, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>Jon entered the house and swept the three-year-old into his embrace. With her arms wrapped tightly around his neck, Katie smeared kisses across her father\u2019s cheek.</p> <p>\u201cHow are my girls doing?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>Maryellen looked up at him and smiled. \u201cYour son might take exception to being called a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops,\u201d Jon said and, leaning down, he kissed the baby\u2019s head. \u201cI keep forgetting about you.\u201d He chuckled at his own joke.</p><p>Maryellen gazed at the baby, gurgling contentedly in her arms. \u201cLet\u2019s remind him around two this morning, shall we, Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Grace.\u201d Jon greeted her with a lazy grin. \u201cGood to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid my parents come by?\u201d Jon asked as he walked over to the kitchen counter and sorted through the mail.</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d Maryellen told him. \u201cThey decided to stay in town until the end of the month.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, Daddy, come see.\u201d Katie grabbed her father\u2019s hand, pulling him toward the puzzle she\u2019d completed before her nap.</p><p>Seeing that the young family was busy, Grace decided to leave. She put a casserole in the oven, then said her farewells and kissed both her grandchildren.</p><p>By the time she pulled into the yard at her home with Cliff in nearby Olalla, she still hadn\u2019t decided what she should do about Will Jefferson. Sooner or later her husband would learn that Will was retiring in Cedar Cove. If she mentioned the fact, it might place more significance on the event than warranted. She didn\u2019t care where Will Jefferson chose to live. He could take up residence on Mars if he wanted to.</p><p>But by the same token, not telling Cliff might make it seem significant in a different way\u2014as if she had something to hide.</p><p>When Cliff heard her car, he came out of the barn, smiling. Buttercup, her golden retriever, wandered over from her perch on the front steps, plumy tail wagging.</p><p>Her husband opened the car door for her. \u201cWelcome home,\u201d he said.</p><p>Grace slipped her arms around his middle and kissed him warmly. When they broke contact, Cliff leaned his head back. \u201cWow! What did I do to deserve this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>Arm in arm, they strolled toward the house. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said casually.</p><p>\u201cI went to see Maryellen after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed me, did you?\u201d she asked with a teasing smile.</p><p>Grace suddenly realized that if she told Cliff about Will, he\u2019d suspect she was with the other man anytime she was late. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to tell him. And yet...Eventually he\u2019d find out. What then?</p><p>Eight</p><p>Troy Davis walked into the house and dejectedly tossed the mail on the kitchen counter. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to look at it. He already knew it was nothing but junk with a couple of bills thrown in. Just like it always was. He felt bored, depressed, lonely. In fact, he was downright crumpy, a word Sandy had invented\u2014grumpy plus cranky \u2014to describe him when he was feeling low. Whenever she\u2019d said it, he\u2019d had to smile.</p><p>Sandy. He missed her, missed her so much.</p><p>Although she\u2019d been in the nursing home for two years, he\u2019d gone there almost every day after work and weekends, too. The nursing home had become an extension of his own home and, apart from his job, visiting Sandy was his routine, his life. Now that she was gone he had time on his hands. Time he didn\u2019t know how to fill.</p><p>Turning on the television, he sat in his favorite chair and watched ten minutes of a Seattle news broadcast. There had to be more to life than this...this emptiness. Because Sandy had required so much of his time, he\u2019d never developed hobbies. He supposed he could now, but he couldn\u2019t think of a single thing that interested him enough to devote his efforts and resources to. This didn\u2019t bode well for retirement.</p><p>Restless, he got up and wandered into the kitchen. He\u2019d been preparing his own meals for years now. Generally he picked up something easy at the grocery store or got takeout from a fast-food place. He\u2019d learned basic cooking skills and mastered the microwave. He could barbecue a steak, nuke a potato and pour salad dressing over lettuce with the best of \u2019em. Nothing fancy, though.</p><p>His stomach growled, reminding him that he should eat. But even the thought of a T-bone steak didn\u2019t excite him. With no energy and no inspiration, he opened the bread drawer and pulled out the peanut butter and jelly. The bread was relatively fresh, and the peanut butter would provide some protein\u2014something Sandy constantly used to harp on. Good enough. He\u2019d make do with a sandwich.</p><p>Sandy would be horrified to see him eating over the kitchen sink. But that way, if the jelly dripped, he didn\u2019t have to worry about wiping off the counter.</p><p>His wife had been a real stickler about sitting down for meals. He felt guilty as he wolfed down his dinner staring out the window into the backyard. When he\u2019d finished, he chased the sandwich with a glass of milk. It smelled a little sour and he should probably check the expiry date. On second thought, better just to empty the rest of it down the drain.</p><p>Moving to the counter, he flipped up the lid of the garbage can\u2014the \u201ccircular file,\u201d as Sandy used to joke\u2014and started sorting through the mail. As he\u2019d suspected, the top three pieces were advertisements. Without reading any of the chance-of-a-lifetime offers, he flicked them into the garbage. The fourth piece was the water bill and the fifth was a card. Probably a belated sympathy card. They were still trickling in.</p><p>The return address read Seattle, but F. Beckwith wasn\u2019t a name he recognized. A friend of Sandy\u2019s? He stared at it for a moment and set it aside while he looked through the last few pieces. Then he picked up the envelope, tore it open and removed the card. His gaze immediately went to the signature.</p><p>Faith Beckwith.</p><p>Faith Beckwith? Troy didn\u2019t know anyone named Beckwith. He\u2019d known a Faith, but that was years ago. He glanced at the opposite side of the card and read,</p><p>Dear Troy,</p><p>I was so sorry to hear about your wife. How very special she must have been. I\u2019ve almost forgiven her for stealing you away from me.</p><p>My husband died three years ago and I truly understand how difficult the adjustment can be.</p><p>Faith Beckwith was the married name of Faith Carroll, his high-school sweetheart. Faith had mailed him a sympathy card? He smiled and almost before he could rationalize what he was doing, Troy reached for the phone. Directory assistance gave him the Seattle number he sought and without hesitation he dialed it.</p><p>Not until it began to ring did he consider what he should say. He\u2019d never been an impulsive man. But he didn\u2019t need to think about what he was doing. Instinctively he knew this was right.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d a soft female voice answered.</p><p>\u201cFaith, this is Troy Davis.\u201d</p><p>The line went silent, and Troy felt her shock.</p><p>\u201cTroy, my heavens, is it really you?\u201d</p><p>She sounded exactly the same as she had when they were high-school seniors. Back then, they\u2019d talked on the phone for hours nearly every night. They\u2019d been in love. The summer after their graduation, he\u2019d gone into the service. Faith had seen him off with kisses and tears, promising to write every day, and in the beginning she had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the correspondence had abruptly stopped. He still had no idea what had gone wrong. Soon afterward, a friend told him Faith was dating someone else. It\u2019d hurt, the way she\u2019d handled their breakup, but that was easy to forgive now. They\u2019d both been so young. Besides, Troy wouldn\u2019t have married Sandy if Faith hadn\u2019t severed their relationship. And he couldn\u2019t imagine his life without Sandy....</p><p>\u201cI got your sympathy card,\u201d he said, explaining the reason for his call. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son lives in Cedar Cove,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI was visiting him and the grandkids, and I saw the Chronicle. I always read the obituaries and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you read about Sandy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is. I\u2019m really sorry about your loss, Troy. I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d want to hear from me. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t mail the card right away.\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t know what else to say until he glanced down at the sympathy card and reread her short message. \u201cWhat did you mean when you said Sandy stole me away?\u201d His memory of their breakup was quite the opposite. Faith had dumped him.</p><p>Her laugh drifted over the phone. \u201cCome on, Troy. You have to know you broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shook his head in bewilderment. She couldn\u2019t have forgotten the callous way she\u2019d treated him. \u201cAs I recall, you\u2019re the one who broke up with me.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d she said. \u201cYou quit writing to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI most certainly did not,\u201d he returned. He\u2019d always wondered what had happened and wasn\u2019t too proud to admit she\u2019d hurt him badly. But none of that was important anymore. Hadn\u2019t been in years.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Faith said. \u201cOne of us seems to have developed a selective memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d Strangely, Troy found he was enjoying this. He knew beyond a doubt that the selective memory was Faith\u2019s\u2014but he was willing to forgive her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, \u201cand it\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s review the events of that summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d she concurred. \u201cPractically as soon as we graduated from high school, you went into basic training.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Troy was with her so far. \u201cI remember clearly that you promised me your undying love when we said goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did and I meant it.\u201d She spoke without hesitation. \u201cI wrote you every single day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the beginning.\u201d He\u2019d lived for Faith\u2019s letters, and when she\u2019d stopped writing he hadn\u2019t known what to think.</p><p>\u201cEvery day,\u201d she reiterated, \u201cand then you stopped writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you.\u201d</p><p>Troy grew quiet. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop writing you, Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stop writing you, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI phoned,\u201d he said, \u201cand your mother said you were out. Later, someone else told me you were seeing some other guy. I got the message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t date anyone other than you until after I left for college that September.\u201d</p><p>The silence seemed to hum between them.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d she breathed slowly. \u201cMy mother was the one who took out the mail every day and collected it, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t like me?\u201d Troy couldn\u2019t remember Mrs. Carroll being particularly hostile toward him.</p><p>\u201cShe liked you fine, but she thought we were too young to be serious,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI made the mistake of telling her I hoped you\u2019d give me an engagement ring for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>The irony was, Troy had planned on doing exactly that.</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say you believed I\u2019d just stopped writing?\u201d Faith asked. \u201cWithout saying a word? You honestly believed I\u2019d do that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Troy admitted. \u201cJust like you believed I\u2019d given up sending you letters.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, then reluctantly agreed. \u201cDid you try to get in touch with me when you finished basic training?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou came home on leave, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Troy told her. \u201cI went to your house\u2014that was in late August\u2014but by then you\u2019d already left for college. I wanted to talk to you, but when I asked for your new address, your mother said it was probably best not to contact you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d Faith groaned. \u201cI never suspected she\u2019d do anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>They both seemed at a loss as to what to say next.</p><p>Finally she whispered, \u201cYou broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t come out of the relationship unscathed, either. \u201cYou broke mine,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Faith exhaled softly, then said, \u201cIt seems my mother has a great deal to answer for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still alive?\u201d Troy didn\u2019t figure there was much point in dwelling on the sins of the past.</p><p>\u201cNo. She died ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite everything, our lives worked out well, didn\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe not the way we expected, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Faith said. \u201cI met Carl at Central Washington and we got married in 1970.\u201d</p><p>Funny little coincidences. \u201cSandy and I were married the same year. In June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twenty-third. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe twenty-third.\u201d</p><p>This was too weird. They\u2019d each been married on the same day and in the same year\u2014to someone else.</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo\u2014a boy, Scott, and a girl, Jay Lynn. Scottie lives in Cedar Cove, like I said, and teaches at the high school. Jay Lynn\u2019s married and the mother of two. She\u2019s currently a stay-at-home mom. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne daughter, Megan. She works at the framing shop down by the waterfront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness! Scottie just had her frame a picture I gave him of his great-grandparents. It was taken in the 1930s on the family farm in Kansas.\u201d</p><p>Their lives had intersected more than once. And in the last few years, she\u2019d visited town to see her family; they could have run into each other at any time, yet never had.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the sheriff these days,\u201d Faith said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cedar Cove\u2019s always been my home. I never wanted to live anywhere else. There aren\u2019t that many of us from our graduating class around anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about Dan Sherman\u2019s death,\u201d Faith told him. \u201cPoor Grace. Scottie called me when his body was discovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a rough one,\u201d Troy said. He knew Dan but they\u2019d never been close friends. \u201cGrace is remarried\u2014to a local rancher.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou\u2019d like Cliff. He\u2019s a down-to-earth, no-nonsense kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Olivia?\u201d</p><p>As he recalled, Faith and Olivia had been fairly good friends in high school.</p><p>\u201cI always meant to keep in touch with Olivia, but life sort of crowded in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia married a guy called Stan Lockhart when she graduated from college. They were divorced the year their son died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew she\u2019d become a judge but I hadn\u2019t heard that she\u2019d lost a child. Or that her marriage broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all happened more than twenty years ago now. You never attended any of the class reunions, did you?\u201d He should know; he\u2019d been to every one.</p><p>\u201cNo. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d Troy would\u2019ve preferred to avoid them, but it was hard since he lived in town. And he\u2019d been one of the senior class officers, so people expected him to plan the event. Against his will, he\u2019d done it for most of the reunions, thanks mainly to Sandy and her organizational skills. His daughter had helped with the last reunion. He\u2019d rather have stayed home.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to be a nurse, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was...am,\u201d she said, correcting herself. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t work in the medical field now. I burned out about ten years ago.\u201d She hesitated, as if uncertain she should continue. \u201cI write a little but it\u2019s no big deal. Articles about health, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m impressed.\u201d Troy had never been good at putting his thoughts on paper. Other than police reports, of course, and that was a matter of getting the facts and stating them clearly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I dabble at it.\u201d He could almost see her shrug. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a way to use some of my medical background.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for another few minutes and then there didn\u2019t seem to be anything more to say. Troy searched for something to keep Faith on the line. All he knew was that he didn\u2019t want to break the connection for fear it would be half a lifetime before they spoke again. If ever...</p><p>\u201cHow often do you get to Cedar Cove these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a lot. But Scottie\u2019s been encouraging me to move back to town and I\u2019m considering it.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d he said, shifting uncomfortably on his feet, \u201cthat we could get together the next time you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said immediately.</p><p>\u201cWe could have coffee and pie at the PancakePalace.\u201d They used to go there on dates, only it\u2019d been a soda and fries.</p><p>\u201cNot Coke and French fries?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember that, too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. We always shared both. I liked more salt than you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know when you\u2019ll be in town?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cI could come next Saturday,\u201d she said, \u201cif that\u2019s convenient.\u201d</p><p>It was convenient. In fact, it couldn\u2019t have been better.</p><p>Nine</p><p>This was the last day of Anson Butler\u2019s two-week leave from army training. In the morning he\u2019d be flying to the east coast for advanced study in computer technology, working with army intelligence. Allison Cox was proud of him, proud of his success and determination. And she dreaded not being able to see him for another eight weeks.</p><p>Her parents had been wonderful to him. Together, as a family, they were sending Anson off with a big barbecue dinner. Even Eddie, her annoying younger brother, had helped decorate the patio with streamers and balloons. All their friends from school would be there, even the ones who\u2019d believed Anson had been responsible for the fire that burned down The Lighthouse restaurant. He\u2019d forgiven them, and if Anson could, then so could she.</p><p>Allison had baked a cake that afternoon and was putting the finishing touches on it\u2014smoothing out the chocolate frosting, adding candied flowers. After that, she\u2019d go and pick up Anson at his mother\u2019s place.</p><p>\u201cYou invited Mrs. Butler, didn\u2019t you?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Allison nodded, although she knew even before issuing the invitation that Cherry Butler would refuse. The truth was, she\u2019d never been much of a mother. \u201cCherry said she\u2019d think about it.\u201d Allison would definitely prefer it if his mother decided not to come. Cherry\u2019s presence would be uncomfortable and, especially if she drank, she was almost guaranteed to embarrass her son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The kitchen door opened and her father came in from the garage. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s a party going on here,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go with Allan Harris?\u201d her mother asked, referring to a local attorney who\u2019d asked to meet with him, despite the fact that this was Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Allison\u2019s parents exchanged a brief kiss.</p><p>Her father started to loosen his tie. \u201cMartha Evans died last night.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother\u2019s face went soft with sympathy. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRosie, she was more than ninety years old and ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the executor of her estate?\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cAllan asked me to notify Martha\u2019s family, none of whom live in town. They\u2019ll be making the funeral arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Allison watched as her father sighed. \u201cMartha\u2019s lived on her own all these years. Pastor Flemming\u2019s the one who found her body. He\u2019d been going over there once or twice a week to check on her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>Allison liked Pastor Flemming, too. Everyone did.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte Rhodes has offered to organize the wake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will Martha\u2019s family\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t get a chance to finish the question before Eddie shouted through the open sliding glass door. \u201cShould I light the barbecue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Zach answered. \u201cI want to change clothes first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEddie!\u201d Allison cried, irritated by her brother\u2019s impatience. \u201cI haven\u2019t even gone to pick up Anson yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. I was just trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate that, Eddie,\u201d Rosie said, mixing chopped green pepper and tomatoes into the lettuce greens. She turned to Allison. \u201cPerhaps you should drive to Anson\u2019s now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Allison said, arranging tiny silver pearls on the border of Anson\u2019s cake.</p><p>\u201cBe sure and let his mother know she\u2019s welcome to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Allison promised. With a last critical look at the cake, she collected her purse and the car keys and headed out the door.</p><p>Anson\u2019s mother lived in a trailer court off Lighthouse Road</p><p>. Allison remembered the first time she\u2019d met Cherry Butler, who\u2019d been if not hostile, certainly unwelcoming. Even she\u2014his mother\u2014had believed Anson was responsible for the fire.</p> <p>Anson\u2019s disappearance had been difficult for Allison. She hadn\u2019t known where he was, whether he was safe, what he was doing. To learn that he\u2019d enlisted in the army\u2014well, that had come as a complete shock.</p><p>Allison pulled into the trailer park, following the dirt road to the last single-wide trailer at the back of the lot. When Anson didn\u2019t step outside after a minute or so, she turned off the engine and climbed out.</p><p>Before she could walk up the three steps, the door opened and Cherry Butler stood in the entrance. She wore a short skirt and a skin-tight sweater. Her hair had been dyed coal-black. Leaning against the door jamb, she held a cigarette loosely in one hand and glared at Allison. Slowly she raised her cigarette to her crimson lips and inhaled.</p><p>\u201cAnson\u2019s not here,\u201d she announced when she\u2019d finished blowing the smoke upward.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so worried.\u201d Cherry seemed to enjoy her discomfort. \u201cHe\u2019s with Shaw. He should be back any minute.\u201d</p><p>Shaw was one of Anson\u2019s best friends and her friend, too, and she realized that Anson would want some private time with his buddy before he left.</p><p>\u201cHe did it for you, you know.\u201d Cherry puffed at her cigarette again. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my son in the military. He knows that. Some recruiter fed him a crock and he believed it. Now see what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson told me he liked the military.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he does. You\u2019d like it, too, if you could hide away all safe and sound while the police are searching for you.\u201d</p><p>Allison stared up at his mother and wished she knew what to say. A moment passed in awkward silence.</p><p>Then, gathering her courage, Allison resolved to speak her mind. \u201cYou\u2019re Anson\u2019s mother.\u201d She took a step closer. \u201cYou should be proud of him, Mrs. Butler\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you the first time you came by that I ain\u2019t never been a Mrs. Anybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Butler.\u201d Allison tried again. \u201cI meant what I said. Anson\u2019s the only one in his basic training class who was selected for this specialized course. He\u2019s smart and...and...I love him. You might think eighteen\u2019s too young to understand about love, but I know what my heart feels.\u201d</p><p>Cherry Butler exhaled a thin line of smoke. \u201cListen, Abby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You just pine your little heart out for my son all you want. He\u2019s leaving, and my guess is he\u2019ll find some other girl soon enough. Men are like that, so do yourself a favor and forget about my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget Anson,\u201d Allison repeated incredulously. \u201cI could never do that.\u201d</p><p>Cherry laughed. \u201cSuit yourself. But take my word for it\u2014he\u2019ll break your heart. He\u2019s no different from any other man. Look at me. I was such an idiot, I actually thought his father would marry me when I told him I was pregnant.\u201d She paused to take another drag on her cigarette. \u201cCouldn\u2019t do it, though, \u2019cause he already had a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson isn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve what you want.\u201d She shrugged carelessly. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ll say about Anson. He\u2019s got his daddy\u2019s brains. Sure as hell didn\u2019t get \u2019em from me.\u201d</p><p>Allison badly wanted this evening to be special for Anson. She took a deep breath. \u201cIt would mean a great deal to Anson if you\u2019d come to the party.\u201d She loved Anson, so she was willing to put aside her own preferences. If, despite everything, he wanted his mother there\u2014and he did\u2014Allison would try to persuade her.</p><p>\u201cParty, is it?\u201d She cocked her eyebrows as she flicked the lit cigarette onto the dirt road.</p><p>\u201cA farewell party,\u201d she elaborated.</p><p>Cherry shook her head. \u201cYou won\u2019t need me for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson would like you there,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease, Mrs.\u2014Cherry.\u201d</p><p>Again his mother declined, shaking her head. \u201cI got things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could be more important than sending Anson off to his new course?\u201d she asked, not understanding how his mother could feel so little pride or concern.</p><p>Allison glanced up as a car came toward the trailer, leaving behind a trail of dust. She recognized Shaw\u2019s old Ford Malibu. He dropped Anson off, waved to Allison, and pulled out again. They\u2019d see him later at the party.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d Anson said, smiling at Allison and then his mother.</p><p>\u201cI was just inviting your mother to join us,\u201d Allison said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was just telling your girlfriend I got better things to do than go to some rich man\u2019s house and make nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt my feelings if you\u2019d rather stay here,\u201d Anson said, not meeting his mother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t figure it would,\u201d Cherry told him.</p><p>Allison felt him stiffen at that response. Then he turned deliberately away. \u201cCome on, Allison, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye-bye,\u201d Cherry said with a flippant wave. She moved inside the trailer and pulled the door shut.</p><p>As soon as his mother was gone, Anson cast Allison an apologetic look. \u201cHow long did I keep you waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of minutes, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she get on your case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and the military.\u201d</p><p>Allison shrugged. \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Anson released his breath. \u201cShe blames you.\u201d</p><p>Allison wasn\u2019t worried. Cherry could blame her, for all she cared.</p><p>\u201cThe military\u2019s my way out, Allison,\u201d he said as if he needed to explain his motivation. \u201cWithout it I wouldn\u2019t have a chance of getting an education. Cherry doesn\u2019t seem to grasp that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Anxious to leave now, she tugged at Anson\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They both climbed into the car and Allison left the trailer park. She drove cautiously to avoid the kids and dogs playing in the dusty roads.</p><p>\u201cIs your family expecting us right away?\u201d Anson asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I suppose. Why?\u201d</p><p>He sent her a quick, secretive smile. \u201cCan we go to the waterfront for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Anywhere in particular?\u201d</p><p>A slow, happy grin spread across his face. \u201cSomewhere private.\u201d</p><p>Allison did take her eyes off the road then. She knew a good place down Lighthouse Road</p><p>and went in that direction. The tide was out, so she pulled onto a stony area near the beach, glancing around to make sure it was as deserted as she\u2019d expected it to be.</p><p>There was no one around.</p><p>Anson got out of the car and Allison did, too. When he joined her, he took her hand; together they walked the short distance to the water. A log had drifted up onto the shore and they stepped over it, making their way along the pebble beach. A pair of long-legged herons waded in the shallow water and seagulls cawed overhead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to wait for me,\u201d Anson said again. \u201cI know what my mother\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Allison didn\u2019t want to waste their last day discussing his mother.</p><p>\u201cI planned to be back sooner, but I needed Shaw to take me someplace.\u201d</p><p>Anson reached inside his pocket and removed a small jeweler\u2019s box, which he flipped open. Inside was a silver ring with a single blue stone. A sapphire, Allison guessed.</p><p>Anson stared down at it and then at her. \u201cI wanted to give you this before I left.\u201d</p><p>Her throat instantly clogged with tears. \u201cOh, Anson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to have something from me to wear so you won\u2019t forget me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson, there\u2019s no chance of that! I won\u2019t forget you.\u201d She hadn\u2019t before and she wouldn\u2019t now. She\u2019d meant what she\u2019d told his mother; she loved Anson.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going off to college. You\u2019ll be surrounded by all those smart, good-looking guys.\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve laughed if her tears hadn\u2019t made it impossible. \u201cHaven\u2019t you figured out yet that you\u2019re the only guy I care about?\u201d She managed a brief smile. \u201cAnd, Anson? You\u2019re smarter and better-looking than any of them.\u201d</p><p>He looked up then, his eyes warm with love. \u201cI adore you, Allison. You\u2019re my whole world. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done without you these last few months. You were all that got me through basic training.\u201d He held out the small velvet box. \u201cMay I put this on you now?\u201d</p><p>She gave him her hand and he slid the ring on her finger. \u201cIt fits,\u201d he said, sighing with relief. \u201cThis ring is a promise from me to you that I won\u2019t even look at another girl while I\u2019m away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI promise I won\u2019t date anyone else, either.\u201d She stretched out her hand, turning it this way and that. \u201cThe ring is beautiful, Anson. My favorite color. It\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to guess at the size.\u201d</p><p>Allison threw her arms around him. \u201cI love you.\u201d They clung to each other for a long moment. When he kissed her, she felt as if she\u2019d spun off into some new galaxy, unknown to anyone but them. It was hard to break away from him, hard to remember that they were in full view of the road and anyone who happened to drive by.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Anson,\u201d she said softly, gazing down at her ring again. \u201cThis is so thoughtful. It\u2019s so you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish it was the Hope Diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my heart it is.\u201d Allison would treasure this ring all her life. She didn\u2019t want him to go, especially so far from Cedar Cove, but at the same time, she knew this was an unmatched opportunity for him. She wouldn\u2019t take it away from Anson for anything.</p><p>Anson locked his arms at the small of her back and leaned his forehead against hers. \u201cWait for me.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019ll always be here for you, Anson. Always.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. They separated reluctantly and, holding hands, walked back to the parked car.</p> <p>In the morning Anson would be gone.</p><p>Ten</p><p>When Teri left the mall Tuesday evening after work, she found James waiting for her. Her husband\u2019s driver, following Bobby\u2019s instructions, drove her to and from the salon; Bobby seemed to think she was safer that way. James stood outside the car near the passenger door, waiting for her. \u201cGood evening, Miss Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, James.\u201d The minute she\u2019d slipped inside the vehicle, she took off her shoes and rubbed her aching feet. She\u2019d had a lot of clients and hardly any breaks.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good day?\u201d he asked in a solicitous voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks.\u201d Generally James wasn\u2019t very talkative. For some reason he\u2019d been more sociable the last few days.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was commendable of you to invite your family for dinner last weekend.\u201d</p><p>Well, it\u2019d been an experience, that was for sure. \u201cIt\u2019s nice of you to say so.\u201d</p><p>He dutifully closed the car door before walking around to the driver\u2019s side. About halfway home, Teri noticed that James kept glancing at her in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cIs something the matter, James?\u201d she asked, finding his behavior curious.</p><p>\u201cWrong, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep looking at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, miss, it\u2019s just that you and your sister don\u2019t resemble each other at all.\u201d</p><p>Teri snickered. \u201cShe\u2019s my half sister and she got the beauty while I got the brains.\u201d Teri wasn\u2019t convinced that was an accurate assessment, but it sounded good.</p> <p>\u201cShe is beautiful,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Surprised at the comment, Teri studied him for a moment. It had never occurred to her that James might be romantically interested in her sister. But why not? And why wouldn\u2019t Christie be interested in him? He was single, employed and attractive in his own way. A considerable improvement over the men she usually chose.</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t take me directly home this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, Miss Teri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me to my sister\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lives in an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, her apartment then.\u201d Teri hadn\u2019t been in contact with Christie in quite some time and certainly hadn\u2019t visited her current home.</p><p>\u201cShould I let Bobby know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll only be a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>James sat up a bit straighter. \u201cWhatever you say, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames, call me Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d</p><p>The drive took a few minutes, so Teri asked James about her husband. Ever since the threat, he\u2019d hardly left the house. But every day, regular as clockwork, he sat in front of the chessboard. How he could concentrate without men on the board was beyond her, but what did she know?</p><p>\u201cHow was Bobby\u2019s day?\u201d she asked. Teri was more concerned about her husband than she wanted to let on. He\u2019d become withdrawn lately. The fact that he sent his driver to escort her to and from work told her he was almost paranoid about her safety. He hated it whenever she left his sight. Clearly there was more to this threat than she\u2019d known. Bobby knew, though, and he wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Teri loved her husband; because of that, she wasn\u2019t about to let some goon blackmail him, using her as bait. She needed to find out what was going on and take action.</p><p>James didn\u2019t respond to her question right away, which implied far more than anything he might have said.</p><p>\u201cHe stayed in the house all day, Miss Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why he hasn\u2019t played in any tournaments lately?\u201d she asked, deciding to force the issue.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014Teri.\u201d He drove into the parking lot of the apartment building on Beach Road</p><p>and turned off the engine. \u201cYour sister\u2019s in the bottom-floor unit, number 102,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThank you, James.\u201d</p><p>He was out of the car and opening her door before Teri had even managed to unfasten her seat belt, then waited by the vehicle while she walked toward her sister\u2019s place. The stretch limo had caught the attention of several residents and half a dozen children came toward James, full of questions.</p><p>Christie answered her knock with a soda in her hand. She blinked in astonishment when she saw Teri.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Teri shrugged, feeling a bit awkward. \u201cI came by to see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d That was the truth\u2014or part of it. She genuinely wanted to reestablish a relationship with her sister. She also thought that encouraging a relationship with James could benefit them all.</p><p>\u201cYou care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m inviting you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Christie eyed her suspiciously. \u201cAgain? Aren\u2019t you worried that I might hit on your precious Bobby?\u201d</p><p>She was and yet she wasn\u2019t. She trusted her husband. Of all the women in the world, he\u2019d chosen to fall in love with her. Bobby Polgar might be many things but fickle he wasn\u2019t, and any fear or jealousy she\u2019d felt had evaporated in the warmth of his love.</p><p>Teri grinned. \u201cYou can try, but it won\u2019t get you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Christie straightened when she saw James standing outside the car with kids swarming around him in the parking lot.</p><p>Teri noticed her sister\u2019s reaction right away. \u201cI\u2019ll send James to pick you up tomorrow. Shall we say six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019d be all right.\u201d Christie acted as though she was doing Teri a favor.</p><p>James held the car door for Teri when she returned. \u201cI hope you won\u2019t mind picking up my sister for dinner tomorrow night,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Miss Teri. It would be my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She had the distinct impression that he meant every word.</p><p>The rest of the ride to Seaside Avenue</p><p>took place in silence. When James let her out, the front door opened immediately and Bobby exploded out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d he demanded, grabbing Teri by the upper arms. His eyes raked over her as if checking for injury.</p><p>\u201cBobby, of course I\u2019m all right. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Teri felt guilty. She should\u2019ve phoned or had James call Bobby, as he\u2019d suggested. \u201cI asked James to drive me to Christie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>There was unmistakable relief in her husband\u2019s eyes. He hugged her, holding her close. With her arms around Bobby\u2019s neck, Teri looked deep into his eyes. She saw in him such love it made her want to weep\u2014and she saw something else. She saw his fear. Bobby was afraid for her. Afraid someone would take her away from him.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit down and talk,\u201d she said, leading him into the house.</p><p>They both sat on the elegant leather couch, and Teri slid close, leaning her head against his chest. \u201cI need to ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know why you\u2019re keeping a constant watch over me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cSo I can be sure you\u2019re safe.\u201d He seemed to feel that should be obvious.</p><p>\u201cI am safe, I promise you. But if you\u2019ve received a threat, then we should deal with it together. We could go to the police or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He shook his head and withdrew his hand from hers.</p><p>Something had happened. His body language made that clear. \u201cBobby,\u201d she whispered, turning to face him. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me.\u201d</p><p>His expression was completely deadpan. He didn\u2019t speak, simply shook his head again.</p><p>Teri\u2019s chest tightened and she rose onto her knees, holding his face between her palms. \u201cBobby, listen to me. I\u2019m your wife and married people communicate with each other. Whatever\u2019s going on, I need to know about it. You should tell me. That\u2019s what married people do.\u201d</p><p>He shifted uneasily.</p><p>\u201cEver since that day those two men showed up at Get Nailed, you\u2019ve been acting weird. Something happened and you\u2019re carrying the weight of this problem all by yourself. I have to know what\u2019s bothering you.\u201d When he didn\u2019t respond, she said, \u201cThey threatened me, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cBobby! I realize you\u2019re trying to protect me and I love you for it, but you\u2019re miserable and because you\u2019re miserable, so am I.\u201d</p><p>He still wouldn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t played any tournaments in weeks. You were born to play chess. It\u2019s your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my life,\u201d he countered. \u201cNothing is more important to me than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be happy if you aren\u2019t,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>Bobby closed his eyes. \u201cShortly after those men came to see you,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cI received a phone call from Aleksandr Vladimir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVladimir. He\u2019s a Russian chess player. He asked me how you were feeling and then said he hoped you were...safe.\u201d</p><p>That was it? \u201cMaybe that\u2019s just a Russian way of congratulating you on our marriage,\u201d she suggested. \u201cOr of extending his best wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bobby\u2019s eyes hardened. \u201cHe was letting me know that he was behind the incident in June\u2014with you and James outside the beauty shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she returned thoughtfully. \u201cIf you feel he was making a threat, veiled or otherwise, then we need to report him to the authorities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Bobby clenched and unclenched his fists. \u201cI have no way of connecting him to the threat. No proof. Going to the police would put you in danger. Don\u2019t ask me to do that, because I can\u2019t.\u201d Rarely had she seen him react more vehemently to anything. His emotion, more than his words, told her how heavily this had weighed on his mind.</p><p>Before she could attempt to reassure him, Bobby kissed the side of her neck, sending shivers down her arms. \u201cI like you more than chess,\u201d he whispered. His fingers slipped inside the opening of her blouse. \u201cAm I communicating well?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered when his hand cupped her breast. \u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you want to discuss?\u201d Bobby asked after a long pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do about this Russian?\u201d she asked, pushing his hands away so she could concentrate.</p><p>Bobby didn\u2019t reply immediately; he seemed to be assessing his options.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re Mafia?\u201d she asked. \u201cRussian Mafia?\u201d</p><p>Bobby shrugged and when he spoke he avoided her question. \u201cVladimir\u2019s a good player, one of the best, but I\u2019m better.\u201d</p><p>In many ways her husband was a humble man, but when it came to chess, he had complete and total faith in his abilities. That unshakable confidence in himself was what she\u2019d found so appealing.</p><p>\u201cVladimir wants you to lose to him,\u201d Teri speculated.</p><p>Bobby nodded.</p> <p>\u201cYou told him you wouldn\u2019t, right?\u201d</p><p>At first he didn\u2019t respond. Eventually, reluctantly, he explained. \u201cVladimir implied that if I didn\u2019t lose to him, something would happen to you.\u201d</p><p>The fiery burst of anger that shot through her was overwhelming. Teri blurted out a few words that apparently shocked Bobby. \u201cI won\u2019t let you lose to him,\u201d she insisted furiously.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s eyes revealed a tortured look. \u201cThe thing is, I can\u2019t lose. I don\u2019t know how to lose. All I know is how to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve given up tournament play, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers, and he answered with a slight incline of his head. \u201cVladimir will get what he wants. The longer I resist, the lower my ranking will go. Soon he\u2019ll be ahead of me.\u201d</p> <p>While Teri understood his reasoning, she also realized it would never happen. The press was demanding a match between the two men and if he refused, Bobby would look like a coward, a loser. Although he hadn\u2019t said so, her husband knew it, too.</p><p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cOlivia! It\u2019s a girl,\u201d Grace Harding all but shouted through her cell phone.</p><p>\u201cKelly had the baby?\u201d Olivia sounded groggy, as though she\u2019d been asleep. If so, she was awake fast enough, and seemed as excited as Grace herself. This was one of the great things about having a best friend like Olivia. You could call her at any hour of the day or night. You could share bad news or good, and she\u2019d always know what to say.</p><p>\u201cI woke you up. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d A quick glance at her watch showed that it was eleven o\u2019clock. Tears of joy made wet tracks down her cheeks. \u201cKelly phoned at nine to tell me she was in labor. I got here just in time to welcome little Emma Grace into the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmma Grace,\u201d Olivia repeated slowly. \u201cWhat a lovely name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d Grace couldn\u2019t stop talking. \u201cShe\u2019s got the biggest, bluest eyes and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet me at the PancakePalace,\u201d Olivia broke in with a laugh. \u201cWe should celebrate.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t champagne Goldie would be pouring\u2014more like decaf coffee. She\u2019d probably bring them each a slice of coconut cream pie, as well.</p><p>For years Olivia and Grace had attended a Wednesday-night aerobics class, followed by coconut pie and coffee. This was tradition. The pie and coffee were their reward for stretching and sweating and leaping up and down. More importantly, Wednesday night was their time to catch up.</p><p>Even though they\u2019d seen each other just the night before, it seemed right to share this moment with Olivia, who\u2019d been a constant in her life since grade school.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in half an hour,\u201d Grace told her. She felt too keyed up to drive home and try to sleep, anyway. It wasn\u2019t every day a woman had a brand-new granddaughter.</p><p>The next call she made was to Cliff; she remembered that he was in the barn, so she left a message. Then she phoned Maryellen, who of course already knew, and finally she drove from the birthing center in Silverdale back to Cedar Cove.</p><p>Grace\u2019s heart soared as she rounded the curving road that edged the Cove. The lights of her hometown welcomed her, and she smiled as she drove past the library and down Harbor Street</p><p>to the PancakePalace. This had been their hangout, hers and Olivia\u2019s, ever since high school.</p><p>Funny, those afternoons didn\u2019t seem that long ago.... They were both grandmothers now, but inside they remained the high-school girls they\u2019d been back then, confiding secrets and gossiping about their friends.</p><p>The PancakePalace had changed little in all those years. The menu was still the same; only the prices had increased. The booths had been reupholstered a number of times, but they were the same red vinyl as they\u2019d been in the days of their youth.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s car was in the parking lot and Grace could see her through the restaurant window. She was in their booth, the very booth where Grace had whispered her dreaded secret when they were high-school seniors. Olivia was the only person who knew Grace was pregnant when they graduated. Grace hadn\u2019t found the courage to tell her parents until Dan had said he\u2019d marry her. Then and only then had they broken the news to her family.</p><p>\u201cYou look far too young to be a grandmother,\u201d Olivia said when Grace slid into the upholstered seat across from her.</p><p>\u201cFive times over.\u201d She had four of her own and was a stepgrandmother to Cliff\u2019s granddaughter, April. And yet it wasn\u2019t so long ago that she\u2019d despaired of ever becoming a grandmother at all. That was when Maryellen was divorced and seemed to have no intention of marrying a second time. Kelly had wanted children but couldn\u2019t conceive.</p><p>Now both her daughters were mothers, each with a boy and a girl\u2014a wealth of happiness that overwhelmed Grace whenever she thought about it.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything about Emma Grace,\u201d Olivia said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a beautiful baby,\u201d Grace began, \u201cwith lots of blond hair, those blue eyes and a scrunched-up red face.\u201d She smiled at the memory of holding Emma. \u201cShe\u2019s got a powerful pair of lungs, too.\u201d</p><p>Goldie, their favorite waitress, approached the table, carrying a pot of coffee in one hand and two pieces of coconut cream pie in the other.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I see you here yesterday?\u201d she asked as she set down the plates. \u201cAnd it\u2019s later than your usual nine-fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a grandma again,\u201d Grace announced proudly.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations!\u201d Goldie poured their coffee. \u201cThe pie\u2019s on the house, girls.\u201d She hurried off to see to another customer, one of the few so late at night.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Kelly doing?\u201d Olivia asked, reaching for her fork.</p><p>\u201cExcited. Jubilant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how you were when you had Maryellen and Kelly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you with Justine and Jordan,\u201d Grace reminded her, \u201cand then later with James.\u201d</p><p>Sadness flashed in Olivia\u2019s eyes at the mention of Jordan, the son she\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said a moment later, rebounding quickly. \u201cNow that both Drake and Emma have made their appearance, it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime\u2014\u201d Olivia pointed her fork at Grace \u201c\u2014to plan your wedding reception.\u201d</p><p>Grace instantly felt guilty about putting this off. She\u2019d been so involved with her daughters and the births of the grandchildren that she\u2019d delayed the reception again and again. \u201cIt\u2019s been so many months now, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Olivia countered, cutting her off. \u201cYour entire family needs to celebrate. All the grandkids are healthy and happy. And you\u2019re married to a wonderful man who adores you.\u201d As if she\u2019d suddenly realized Cliff wasn\u2019t with them, Olivia sat up and looked around. \u201cSpeaking of Cliff...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s at home, or more accurately, in the barn. Sunshine decided to deliver her foal, so Cal and Vicki are both with him. It\u2019s Sunshine\u2019s first and Cliff wants to be sure everything goes okay.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled softly. \u201cA night of births...\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded, feeling emotional. After a sip of coffee, she changed the subject. \u201cWell, we know what my husband\u2019s doing. How\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s snoring contentedly. The phone didn\u2019t even wake him.\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYour Sleeping Beauty,\u201d Grace teased.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014we\u2019re mixing up our fairy tales.\u201d Olivia laughed. \u201cAll I know is that we both ended up with a happily ever after. However long that might be,\u201d she added soberly, and Grace knew she was thinking of Jack\u2019s heart attack two years earlier.</p><p>Grace could only hope he\u2019d truly mended his high-cholesterol, junk-food ways. What she liked best about Jack Griffin, and there was a lot to admire, was the fact that he loved her friend. They were two of the most mismatched people she could imagine. And yet...it worked.</p><p>\u201cSet a date for the reception,\u201d Olivia urged her. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll help as much as I can.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. Olivia was right; it was time to celebrate her marriage. They were never going to find a date that suited absolutely everyone. That was why they\u2019d gotten married during a library conference Grace was attending in San Francisco. They both had busy lives, and so did their children. But instead of fitting their schedules to everyone else\u2019s, they\u2019d simply eloped. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, and Grace had no regrets.</p><p>Except one. She hadn\u2019t realized how upset everyone would be with her and Cliff. Even Olivia felt hurt. Cliff and Grace hadn\u2019t meant to exclude anyone; all they\u2019d wanted was to be together as husband and wife. A wedding reception would allow their family and friends to celebrate to their hearts\u2019 content.</p><p>\u201cHow about two months from now? I\u2019ll confirm with Cliff and let you know.\u201d Grace dug into her pie, savoring the first bite. Coconut was her favorite although it was probably a bad choice from a health point of view. On the other hand, was there a good choice when you were talking about pie?</p><p>Olivia set down her fork and wrapped one hand around her mug. She stared into her coffee. \u201cI thought you should know. Will\u2019s in town. Mom called me this evening.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s heart slowed to a dull, irregular beat. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe showed up at Mom and Ben\u2019s earlier today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the most intelligent response, but she couldn\u2019t come up with anything else to say.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he staying?\u201d she finally mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWith Mom and Ben for now.\u201d Olivia looked down at the table. \u201cApparently he\u2019s going to look for an apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you didn\u2019t mention my house is for rent, did you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s gaze shot to hers. \u201cNo way! You mean it\u2019s still vacant?\u201d</p><p>The house felt like a weight around her neck. A young navy couple, Ian and Cecilia Randall, had rented it on a month-to-month basis; they\u2019d barely moved in when they received word of a transfer to San Diego. The rental property had sat empty for two and a half months.</p><p>The rental agent had told her that with the George Washington leaving port, the market was glutted with available properties. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t planning to rent a house, thankfully.\u201d</p><p>Grace pushed the pie away, her appetite gone. \u201cIf Will knew my house was available...\u201d She didn\u2019t finish the thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell him,\u201d Olivia assured her. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Mom won\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>Grace leaned her elbows on the table. \u201cMy biggest fear is that Will might make trouble between Cliff and me,\u201d she confessed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that\u2019s on my mind, too,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cMom doesn\u2019t seem to think so, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s spoken to Will about it?\u201d Charlotte wasn\u2019t one to shy away from an uncomfortable subject. Grace was grateful for the older woman\u2019s wisdom. Grateful, too, that she\u2019d confronted her son and his sudden need to return to Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cMom told me that Will claims he has no intention of pestering you.\u201d</p><p>Grace hoped that was true. Even after she\u2019d broken off their relationship, Will had attempted to get in touch with her, to explain away his lies and tell her fresh ones. She\u2019d nearly lost Cliff once because of Will; she couldn\u2019t risk that happening a second time.</p><p>\u201cDoes Cliff know?\u201d Olivia asked as if reading her thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to tell him, but I haven\u2019t done it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that we\u2019re so happy and I don\u2019t want anything to upset that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing Cliff, he\u2019d be far more upset if he learned Will\u2019s living in Cedar Cove and you didn\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell him, I promise.\u201d She\u2019d do it as soon as she got home. This was too important to leave to chance. She wouldn\u2019t jeopardize her marriage over someone as deceitful and dishonorable as Will Jefferson.</p><p>They finished their coffee and stood up to go, leaving a bigger than usual tip for Goldie. As they started walking to the door, Olivia gave her a hug. \u201cCongratulations, Grandma.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Olivia yawned. \u201cNow let\u2019s go home and get to bed. I have to be at work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Grace wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be able to sleep. First, there was the birth of Emma Grace and now this distressing news about Will Jefferson. Olivia had warned her weeks ago, but Grace hadn\u2019t believed Will would actually do it. Hadn\u2019t believed he\u2019d dare. Yet here he was.</p><p>The light in the barn was off when she pulled into the yard and parked in her usual spot. Grace figured Cliff must be in the house. She hoped he hadn\u2019t gone to bed.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Grace?\u201d he said, coming to meet her in the entryway, accompanied by the dog.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d She stooped to pet Buttercup, then walked into her husband\u2019s arms. After a lengthy hug, she asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Sunshine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFabulous. She has a handsome son and she\u2019s doing well. How\u2019s Kelly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a beautiful daughter and she\u2019s doing well, too.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled and hugged her again. \u201cLittle Emma Grace\u2014she couldn\u2019t have a nicer name.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled. \u201cOlivia and I celebrated with pie and coffee at the PancakePalace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what your message said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia insisted we set a date for our wedding reception so I suggested mid-October. Is that okay with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure\u2014as long as this is something you want to do.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI want the world to know I\u2019ve got the best husband in the world.\u201d</p><p>Cliff kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m the lucky one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so, do you?\u201d Try as she might, Grace was unable to stifle a yawn.</p><p>Slipping his arm around her waist, Cliff led her down the hallway to their bedroom. \u201cYou must be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d be too keyed up to sleep, but...\u201d</p><p>Cliff yawned, too. \u201cI thought the same thing. Come on, honey, let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She should tell him now, Grace realized. But because they had so much to celebrate, she decided she couldn\u2019t. Not then. Perhaps in the morning. Right now they were both too tired. They were happy. To destroy the evening with news of Will Jefferson just seemed wrong.</p><p>All she could do was pray that Cliff didn\u2019t learn it from anyone else.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>\u201cCan Rachel take me shopping?\u201d Jolene asked for the sixth time.</p><p>\u201cI said that would be fine,\u201d Bruce muttered, leafing through the Cedar Cove Chronicle. He worked hard at his computer support business and needed this quiet time in the evenings. Just half an hour to regroup; that was all. Since Stephanie\u2019s death he\u2019d developed a routine with their daughter. He got home from work, watched the news and read the paper while Jolene entertained herself with a book or a jigsaw puzzle. Afterward they prepared dinner together. Their meals weren\u2019t always the meat-and-potatoes variety, either. Some nights it was bacon, eggs and waffles. More than once they\u2019d had cookies and milk with popcorn for dessert, but he didn\u2019t make a habit of that.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t phone her,\u201d Jolene whined.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d he said. She\u2019d called Rachel Pendergast often enough in the past. Rachel had stepped in as a surrogate mother after Stephanie\u2019s death and spent many evenings and Saturdays with them both.</p><p>At age five, Jolene had decided she needed a mother and she\u2019d chosen Rachel. Bruce smiled as he recalled the day they\u2019d met Rachel at the beauty salon\u2014and how embarrassed he\u2019d been by his daughter\u2019s pronouncement. But Bruce gratefully accepted Rachel\u2019s involvement in their lives, as long as nothing was required of him. He wasn\u2019t interested in a romantic relationship, he told himself again. He was a one-woman man, and Stephanie was that woman. Now that she was gone he had no intention of marrying again. Rachel understood that, although most women didn\u2019t. Since he was what people considered prime marriage material, various friends had taken it upon themselves to find him a wife. Bruce had been in more than his share of uncomfortable social situations with women whose objectives were explicit\u2014if not explicitly stated. Sooner or later, they all learned that he wasn\u2019t interested.</p><p>\u201cI want you to phone Rachel,\u201d Jolene said.</p><p>Bruce lowered the newspaper. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause then she\u2019ll know you approve.\u201d</p><p>Bruce could see that the peacefulness of the evening was already shattered. Jolene talked to Rachel on a regular basis; the two of them seemed to get together at least once a week for one reason or another. More often now that Lover Boy had departed for San Diego. Nate Olsen was no loss as far as Bruce was concerned, although he hadn\u2019t said that to Rachel. She could date whomever she wanted.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Jolene handed him the portable phone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d he muttered. If he was truthful, he\u2019d admit he wasn\u2019t opposed to contacting Rachel. He considered her a friend\u2014a good enough friend to be on speed dial.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said when she picked up. \u201cAre you doing anything special this Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene needs to go school shopping and she\u2019d like you to take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount me in.\u201d</p><p>Bruce grinned at her enthusiasm. He didn\u2019t understand this thing about women and shopping. He didn\u2019t know a single one who wouldn\u2019t leap at the opportunity to dash to a mall. A sale on bedsheets, some kind of giveaway, a makeup demonstration\u2014any excuse would do.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou women and your shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Bruce, you don\u2019t want to go there. Men have their own preferences. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re sitting in front of the television right now with the remote control on the arm rest. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re reading the paper at the same time as you\u2019re watching the TV news.\u201d</p><p>How did she know this much about his evening routine? He supposed it shouldn\u2019t surprise him. Rachel had often been to his house over the past few years and he\u2019d been to hers. She was the only woman who\u2019d breached his defenses. Suddenly he wondered if she was right about other men\u2019s routines being the same as his. And if she was, how had she found out?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you hear from Lover Boy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d stop calling Nate that,\u201d she said, the humor leaving her voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay, your Sailor Man,\u201d he revised. The truth was, Bruce had never much cared for Rachel\u2019s navy boyfriend. For one thing, he couldn\u2019t imagine them as a couple. For another, Nate seemed to resent the time Rachel spent with Jolene. In fact he\u2019d tried on more than one occasion to come between them. So far, that hadn\u2019t worked; Rachel wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>\u201cWe talk almost every day. He misses me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss him?\u201d Bruce asked, although he already knew what she\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cLike crazy. I\u2019m going to fly down to California to visit him soon. Or he\u2019ll fly up here for a weekend. We\u2019re miserable without each other.\u201d</p><p>Bruce had to bite his tongue to keep from making a sarcastic remark. He wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d bothered to ask. Thinking about Nate Olsen and Rachel invariably put him in a bad mood, although he refused to delve any further into the reasons for that.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s new in town?\u201d Rachel asked, abruptly changing the subject. \u201cYou\u2019re reading the paper, aren\u2019t you? Give me an update.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, looking at the front page. \u201cThe school board\u2019s bringing a new bond issue to the ballot in September. You\u2019ll vote for it, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an article here by Jack Griffin about the HarborStreetArtGallery. Apparently the owners are closing it, at least for the winter months, and maybe for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Rachel murmured. \u201cMaryellen Bowman\u2019s going to feel awful about that. She\u2019s the one who built it up. A lot of local artists depend on that extra income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also a short piece about a farewell party for Linnette McAfee,\u201d Bruce went on. \u201cApparently her last day at the Medical Clinic is next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry she\u2019s moving away,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cIf anyone should move, it\u2019s Cal,\u201d she added indignantly.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Cal?\u201d</p><p>She launched into a rather involved explanation of Linnette and Cal Washburn and their relationship, ending with, \u201cHe broke her heart and now she\u2019s leaving town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d That didn\u2019t make sense to Bruce, either, but then he was the last person who\u2019d understand the whys and wherefores of a relationship. Rachel explained why she thought Linnette had decided to move. It still didn\u2019t make sense to him. So Linnette and this Cal broke up. So what? This wasn\u2019t junior high. Everyone should be able to coexist and behave like the adults they were.</p><p>\u201cMartha Evans\u2019s funeral was this week,\u201d Rachel said next. \u201cAnything in the paper about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe was an elderly woman. Around ninety. I did her hair for the funeral.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like thinking about it. \u201cThat\u2019s something you do?\u201d he asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course. She was a lovely woman. I\u2019ll miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe funeral home occasionally hires me. And I was very fond of Martha so I wanted to do it.\u201d</p><p>They chatted for another while, joking back and forth, filling each other in on what was happening at work. When he replaced the phone, Bruce was shocked to realize they\u2019d talked for more than an hour.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Rachel say?\u201d Jolene asked. She\u2019d been waiting patiently, completing a jigsaw puzzle of horses grazing in a field. Five hundred pieces! He was impressed.</p><p>\u201cShe said she\u2019d be by to pick you up at nine-thirty on Saturday morning,\u201d he said absently. An hour. He\u2019d spent an entire hour on the phone with Rachel?</p><p>Something was wrong.</p> <p>Bruce didn\u2019t even like talking on the phone. Five minutes, tops. Say what\u2019s necessary and hang up. He could barely remember a conversation in his entire adult life that had lasted more than fifteen minutes.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d Jolene cut into his musings.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re standing up but you\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d He hadn\u2019t been aware that he was on his feet until Jolene pointed it out.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d his daughter asked.</p> <p>Bruce sat back down. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d He felt dizzy, and that was unusual for him. In fact, his head was spinning. Maybe he had the flu. Yeah, a flu named Rachel. Where did that thought come from? Squinting at his daughter, he noticed she was looking at him strangely.</p><p>\u201cShould I call 911?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He forced a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I do have a question for you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She knelt in front of him, her hand on his knee. \u201cDo you want me to get you a glass of water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d His heart felt like an oil-rig pump that had gone berserk, but he chose to ignore that. \u201cYou like Rachel, don\u2019t you?\u201d But Jolene didn\u2019t need to answer. Rachel had taken Stephanie\u2019s place in her life. His own parents lived in Connecticut, and Jolene had only seen them two or three times. Stephanie\u2019s parents had divorced when she was young and she\u2019d never had a good relationship with her father. Her mother had died within two years of Stephanie; she\u2019d never recovered from the loss of her only child. So it\u2019d always been just Bruce and his daughter. Except for Rachel...</p><p>\u201cDad, of course I like Rachel,\u201d Jolene said. \u201cYou like her, too, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad at her or anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, everything\u2019s...fine.\u201d</p><p>The relief in his daughter\u2019s eyes quickly turned to fear. \u201cShe\u2019s not marrying Nate and moving to San Diego, is she?\u201d</p><p>Not if I can help it, his mind shouted. With Jolene studying him intently, he shook his head and pretended nothing was amiss.</p><p>Together they made dinner. Jolene prepared a green salad while Bruce fixed tuna sandwiches. Dinnertime had been important to Stephanie. Because he knew this was something his wife would\u2019ve wanted, Bruce had continued the practice of having dinner with Jolene every evening. While she described her day, he did his best to pay attention. During the summer she attended a church day camp, which she loved. She launched into a long, complicated story about a little play she was in, and he forced himself to nod and exclaim in the right places.</p><p>Summer bedtime was nine-thirty and Jolene went without an argument. He cleaned up the kitchen, then thought about going to bed himself, only he wasn\u2019t tired. After washing a load of laundry and dumping it in the dryer, he cleaned the bathroom. This burst of nervous energy wasn\u2019t a bad thing, he decided. Rare and surprising, perhaps, but nothing to be alarmed by.</p><p>Once in bed, he tossed and turned for another hour, then realized he wouldn\u2019t sleep until he\u2019d talked to Rachel again. Her phone rang four times before she answered.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Her voice was soft with sleep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d he said, feeling a bit unnerved when he glanced at the clock on his nightstand and saw that it was after midnight.</p><p>\u201cBruce? Do you know what time it is?\u201d She sounded more awake now\u2014and annoyed.</p><p>\u201cSorry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we talked earlier,\u201d he began, not knowing where to go from there.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were on the phone for over an hour.\u201d</p><p>His announcement was met with silence, so he forged ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s something happening between us, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, or it could have been a suppressed yawn. \u201cNo, there isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never talked to a woman for that long in my whole life.\u201d He hesitated, then added, \u201cSomeone other than Stephanie, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou woke me out of a dead sleep to tell me that?\u201d Now her voice was incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce, listen, we\u2019re friends. We\u2019ve been friends for years. Friends talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t chitchat on the phone,\u201d he said forcefully. \u201cI just don\u2019t. I never have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making too much of this, okay? It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene\u2019s worried.\u201d He said the next thing that came to mind.</p><p>\u201cAbout you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he told her swiftly. \u201cShe\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s afraid you\u2019re going to marry Nate and leave.\u201d He was worried, too, but he couldn\u2019t tell Rachel that. He\u2019d already revealed far too much of his confusion. His feelings for Rachel were changing\u2014or perhaps he simply hadn\u2019t recognized them for what they were.</p><p>\u201cBruce, Jolene and I have discussed this at length. If she mentions it to you again, tell her the person she needs to talk to is me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d he asked. They were talking about his daughter here and he had a right to know.</p><p>Rachel yawned before answering. \u201cI promised her she\u2019d always be part of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to marry Lover Boy, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop it,\u201d she chastised none too gently.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m worried about Jolene,\u201d he whispered. It felt like he was about to lose his best friend, and depression settled heavily on his shoulders. If Rachel did marry Nate, that was exactly what would happen. She\u2019d move away and leave them both.</p><p>\u201cCan I go back to sleep now?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI feel like talking,\u201d he murmured, lying down again, the pillow nestling his head.</p><p>\u201cBruce, it\u2019s almost one in the morning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But you\u2019re awake now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks to you. What would you like to talk about\u2014other than Nate and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to go out for dinner on Saturday night? After shopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go back to sleep. That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake two aspirin and call me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Despite himself, he grinned. \u201cGood night, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Bruce,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>He was smiling as he replaced the receiver\u2014even though he didn\u2019t have anything to smile about. Because Rachel might very well marry Nate Olsen, and then the emptiness she\u2019d filled would be deeper than ever before.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>Sitting with the other ladies at the HenryM.JacksonSeniorCenter, Charlotte Rhodes knitted with furious speed. Her friends chatted, but Charlotte\u2019s mind was moving as fast as her hands.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Helen Shelton said. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re a thousand miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d she murmured with a start. She hadn\u2019t been listening to her friends\u2019 conversation, but the fact that they\u2019d realized it was embarrassing. She smiled apologetically at Helen, who was a favorite of hers and another expert knitter. She was a widow, living in a lovely duplex on Poppy Lane</p><p>; the two women had much in common and spent many an afternoon knitting and exchanging stories.</p><p>But at the moment Charlotte was worrying about her son and his recent move to Cedar Cove. On the surface, Will\u2019s decision to retire in Washington seemed logical, but knowing what she did, Charlotte had good reason to be suspicious.</p><p>\u201cBess asked if you\u2019d check her knitting,\u201d Helen said. \u201cI can\u2019t quite figure out what she\u2019s done wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Charlotte set her own knitting aside and studied her friend\u2019s half-finished sock. She\u2019d discovered many an easy fix in sixty years of working with needles and yarn. When people came to her with knitting difficulties, her initial advice was always the same: Read the pattern. If the directions weren\u2019t clear the first time, then read them again.</p><p>She glanced at the sock pattern, which had been passed around among the knitters and looked a little the worse for wear. She found Bess\u2019s mistake quickly enough and repaired it, using a crochet hook to pick up a dropped stitch.</p><p>The ladies at this table were her dearest friends in the world, and yet Charlotte couldn\u2019t divulge her troubles to them. That just wasn\u2019t done by most women of her generation. Family problems stayed inside the family. They were not to be discussed with outsiders, and that included one\u2019s very closest friends.</p><p>She envied Olivia and Grace their friendship. There wasn\u2019t anything those two couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t talk about. But Charlotte couldn\u2019t share her disappointment in her oldest child with anyone other than her husband. Ben might not be Will\u2019s father but he was part of her family now.</p><p>How could she tell her friends that her only son had a weak character? How could she reveal to these women that Will had dishonored his wedding vows? Not once, but repeatedly. His ex-wife, Georgia, had kept this a secret for as long as she could and then the poor girl couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Charlotte didn\u2019t blame her. If Clyde had been alive, she knew he\u2019d be embarrassed and ashamed by Will\u2019s behavior and would no doubt have a few things to say to his son. Maybe it was just as well that Clyde had gone on to his heavenly reward rather than suffer such disillusionment about his only son.</p><p>Ben was at home when she returned from the knitters\u2019 group. He opened the front door as she approached the steps, taking them slowly and one at a time.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders,\u201d he said, taking the bag from her hand and steering her into the house. Charlotte went automatically to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIf conversation goes along with that tea.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte wasn\u2019t sure she could talk; her throat felt like it was closing. Swallowing hard, she nodded because she needed to talk, needed to share the feelings that pressed on her so heavily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ben collected the cups and saucers while she boiled water and measured out tea leaves. Soon they were sitting at the kitchen table across from each other but before she could pour the tea, he reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201cIs it Will?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he? Do you know?\u201d</p><p>Ben shrugged. \u201cHe left a couple of hours ago. Said he was meeting with a rental agent to look at apartments.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid he say where he was hoping to move?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me he\u2019d like to find an apartment near us, in the downtown area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that,\u201d she said starkly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ben asked, sounding genuinely taken aback. \u201cIt seemed thoughtful of him to want to be close by. In case either of us needs him, he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHogwash,\u201d Charlotte sputtered.</p> <p>Ben\u2019s eyes widened at her outburst.</p><p>\u201cI know my son,\u201d she said, \u201cand his wanting to be downtown has nothing to do with any concern for our well-being.\u201d Her hand shook as she filled their teacups. \u201cWe aren\u2019t the only ones nearby,\u201d she muttered, then pressed her lips together in consternation.</p><p>Ben frowned, as if he didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Grace,\u201d she said, setting the teapot back on the table.</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously think he\u2019s still hung up on Grace?\u201d Ben asked. He seemed to find it far-fetched that Will would go to such extremes. \u201cHe knows she\u2019s married to Cliff, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he does. But a little thing like a wedding ring hasn\u2019t stopped him in the past,\u201d she said. A sick feeling settled in the pit of her stomach. \u201cI know my son,\u201d she said again. \u201cHe\u2019s highly competitive. That\u2019s one of the reasons he was such a success in the corporate world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, he doesn\u2019t like to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe detests it.\u201d Charlotte could list plenty of examples from her son\u2019s youth but resisted. \u201cHe\u2019s going to move downtown and in a week or two he\u2019s going to get a library card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Grace...\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor no other reason,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t felt a need for one in the last thirty-five years. Now, however, it\u2019s going to be a necessary part of his relocation. Mark my words,\u201d she added, tapping her fingers rhythmically on the table.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late as far as Grace is concerned,\u201d Ben said. \u201cShe\u2019s happily married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d And Charlotte felt it was her duty to see that nothing ruined Grace\u2019s happiness. Grace was like a second daughter to her. Charlotte wasn\u2019t planning to sit idly by and allow her own son to destroy Grace\u2019s life. He wouldn\u2019t succeed in seducing her again, but he was perfectly capable of interfering in her marriage, spreading innuendo and suspicion.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you so worried?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, the front door opened. In walked Will, looking carefree and decidedly pleased with himself. His eyes brightened and he smiled as he entered the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d he announced. \u201cAnd I\u2019d love a cup of tea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Charlotte asked. She stood automatically to get him a cup and was struck by what a handsome man he was, even more handsome at sixty than he\u2019d been as a young man. He was tall and well-built, physically fit. He had a sense of style, too; from the time he was a teenager he\u2019d taken care with his clothes. She remembered that he\u2019d always been far more fashion-conscious than his peers. Recently his hair had begun to gray at the temples, giving him a distinguished look. Considering his appearance and his well-developed charm, it was little wonder that women had fallen at his feet. Even sensible women, like Grace.</p><p>\u201cI found a small two-bedroom unit right off Harbor Street</p><p>,\u201d Will told them triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cOff...Harbor Street</p><p>?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the water,\u201d he said as she handed him his tea.</p><p>Charlotte knew of only one apartment complex on the waterfront. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a rental sign there,\u201d she said, none too pleased. Naturally Will had chosen an apartment that was practically next door to the library.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m subletting the unit,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019d prefer a more upscale place, but this will do for now.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte caught Ben\u2019s eye. He nodded, got up and politely excused himself.</p><p>She waited until he\u2019d left the room, then confronted her son. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen to be Linnette McAfee\u2019s apartment, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure does.\u201d He sounded surprised. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with her mother,\u201d Charlotte told him. \u201cCorrie hates the idea of her daughter moving away from Cedar Cove.\u201d But Linnette was determined to leave, whether the apartment was rented or not.</p><p>\u201cWell, her loss is my gain,\u201d Will said, as though it was a joke. \u201cI should be able to move in sometime next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I suppose congratulations are in order,\u201d she managed to mumble.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out of your hair but I\u2019ll still be around,\u201d Will told his mother.</p><p>Charlotte didn\u2019t comment. Instead she stood and carried her untouched tea to the sink. Keeping her back to her son, she attempted to control her reactions. Turning to face him, she tried to gauge his intentions, troubled by the fact that she thought the worst of her only son.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re doing the right thing?\u201d she asked tentatively.</p><p>Will wore a perplexed expression. \u201cOf course I\u2019m sure. Although you\u2019re both healthy, I feel it\u2019s my duty to be close by in case you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia and Jack are less than two miles away.\u201d</p><p>For the first time Will seemed to notice that Ben had left the room. If he was looking to his stepfather for support, Ben wasn\u2019t there to give it to him.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019d rather I wasn\u2019t living in Cedar Cove?\u201d Will asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that,\u201d Charlotte told him. Will was, after all, her son and she was happy to have him there\u2014as long as his intentions were honorable.</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d he asked, gesturing with his hands, palms up.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is Grace Harding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d Will repeated her name with a frown. \u201cWhat\u2019s Grace got to do with any of this?\u201d Had she not known him so well, Charlotte might have questioned her own perceptions.</p><p>\u201cI know what you did,\u201d she said, refusing to hide her awareness of his behavior. She\u2019d never spoken of it before, but Will needed to realize he hadn\u2019t deceived everyone. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say on the matter.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cI suppose Olivia couldn\u2019t wait to come tattling,\u201d he muttered, anger shadowing his face.</p><p>\u201cHardly. I surmised what went on between the two of you all by myself.\u201d</p><p>Will exhaled slowly. \u201cLet me assure you, Mother, that your concerns are groundless. I\u2019m delighted for Grace and...her husband. I wish them the very best. Grace made her choice and while I wish she\u2019d chosen to marry me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry you!\u201d Charlotte exploded. \u201cYou were married to Georgia at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were planning to divorce,\u201d he said with perfect calm.</p><p>Charlotte knew he was lying. \u201cOh, Will,\u201d she whispered, her heart aching. \u201cDo you honestly believe you can lie to me so easily? I\u2019m your mother. I know you.\u201d</p><p>Will had never liked being confronted, least of all by her. He bit his lip, the same way he had as a boy. \u201cLet me assure you, Mother, I am not interested in getting involved with Grace. I\u2019m sincere about that. Like I said, I wish her and Cliff happiness. Right or wrong, I lost her and I accept that. I\u2019ll step aside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean it?\u201d Charlotte asked, meeting his eyes.</p><p>Will grinned, and he certainly didn\u2019t look like a man who\u2019d deceive his own mother.</p><p>\u201cScout\u2019s honor.\u201d He held his arms open and when she moved into his embrace, he hugged her gently.</p><p>He disappeared again soon afterward without mentioning where he was going. Ben was in the living room reading in his recliner, with Harry, her guard cat, on his lap.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d he asked when she joined him.</p><p>\u201cI...think so. I couldn\u2019t go another day without speaking my mind. I had to tell Will how unhappy I am about his behavior.\u201d</p><p>Ben set aside his book, the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, draping it over the arm of his chair. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, I know what it\u2019s like to have children who disappoint you. You aren\u2019t alone in that, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He spoke from experience. Ben\u2019s son David had constant money problems and often came to his father seeking financial assistance. Wisely Ben had made it a policy not to give his son any loans until he\u2019d paid off the money he\u2019d already borrowed.</p><p>\u201cIn some ways I wish the problem with Will was money,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me to trust his intentions toward Grace. Really, I didn\u2019t have any choice but to tell him I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Ben said, stroking Harry\u2019s fur from ears to tail. The cat purred with pleasure. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what do I do if he goes against his word?\u201d Much as she wanted to believe that Will would do the honorable thing, deep down she suspected he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, my love,\u201d Ben said. \u201cDon\u2019t borrow trouble. Each day brings enough as it is. Take him at his word until you have reason to doubt him. Then and only then, confront him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIn other words, I shouldn\u2019t cross that bridge until I come to it\u2014and other assorted clich\u00e9s.\u201d</p><p>Ben stretched out his hand. \u201cExactly,\u201d he said, smiling widely.</p><p>Charlotte walked over to her husband\u2019s chair and slipped her arm around his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I married you. You\u2019re a man of wisdom, Mr. Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>Ben kissed her fingers. \u201cI was smart enough to marry the most beautiful woman in the universe. Now, didn\u2019t you say something this morning about an apple pie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cApple\u2019s my favorite pie for August, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was October,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHmm. You might be right. But we don\u2019t want to be rigid about these things, do we?\u201d</p><p>Unable to stop herself, Charlotte laughed again. She did love this man. She\u2019d found love twenty years after losing the husband she\u2019d adored. All she could hope was that her son would find a woman strong enough to love him despite his flaws. Strong enough to teach him despite his failings.</p><p>If such a woman existed.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>He was acting like a high-school kid, Troy Davis chided himself. He\u2019d actually started whistling as he got ready for his evening out with Faith. Whistling! Anyone hearing him, watching him, would hardly recognize him as the sober, level-headed sheriff of Cedar Cove\u2014but he didn\u2019t care what anyone thought. This was the first Saturday night in years\u2014yes, years\u2014that was about indulgence, not obligation. He felt a little guilty thinking that, since he\u2019d loved Sandy so much, but surely he was entitled to an evening of simple enjoyment. Surely he was entitled to this sense of joyful anticipation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Faith had invited him to dinner at her house in Seattle. Late in the afternoon he shaved, then slapped on aftershave, the same brand he\u2019d been wearing for decades. Maybe it was time for a change, he reflected. When he\u2019d finished combing his hair, he searched his closet for a dress shirt. Not the starched-collar type; a knit one that would be considered appropriate for church on Sunday morning. Appropriate for a dinner date on Saturday evening.</p><p>Ever since that first call, he\u2019d talked to Faith nearly every night. Usually he wasn\u2019t one to while away an hour on idle conversation, yet he and Faith were on the phone that long and sometimes longer. Then they\u2019d hang up and Troy would remember four or five other things he wished he\u2019d said; he\u2019d have to resist the urge to call her right back.</p><p>They\u2019d met a week ago in Cedar Cove for hot, greasy French fries and a diet soda\u2014at the PancakePalace, of course. The haunt of their youth, as Faith described it. Afterward, they\u2019d wandered down to the marina. They chatted and laughed and reminisced. By the time Faith drove back to Seattle, night had begun to fall.</p><p>Troy had waited until he assumed she was home and then phoned, just to be sure she\u2019d arrived safely. They\u2019d spent almost four hours together, and another hour on the phone once Faith was back in Seattle.</p> <p>They hadn\u2019t kissed. Not yet, anyway. He hadn\u2019t even touched her in more than the most impersonal of ways\u2014fingers brushing as he passed her a drink, a hand on her elbow as they crossed the street. Frankly, he was afraid. He was determined to put those fears behind him, though, and if the opportunity arose, if the moment was right, he\u2019d approach her for a kiss. She had to want it, too. It\u2019d been so many years since he\u2019d needed to read those signs.... Well, he just hoped he\u2019d know.</p><p>Before he left the house, Troy rummaged through the bathroom looking for cologne, which, to his utter frustration, he couldn\u2019t find. His daughter had given him some for Christmas. Nice stuff, expensive. That must\u2019ve been a year ago, maybe two, and he was sure he\u2019d tucked it away somewhere in the bathroom. He\u2019d never even opened the bottle.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, Sandy had still been living at home so it would\u2019ve been more than two years. By now, it was probably ruined, anyway. Just as well; he didn\u2019t want to be too obvious. And he probably shouldn\u2019t wear competing scents, not that he\u2019d really notice but women tended to have a better sense of smell. Fine. The aftershave was sufficient.</p><p>He straightened some magazines in the living room, trying to calculate when he should leave. He\u2019d rather not show up early, which might look a bit pathetic, but getting there late might be seen as rude. Traffic and the ferry schedule made it difficult to figure out exactly how long the drive would take.</p><p>Just as he\u2019d decided it was time to go, he heard the front door open.</p> <p>\u201cDad, are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan?\u201d His heart sank. He hadn\u2019t said anything about Faith to his daughter. Not because he felt guilty, not really. But he wasn\u2019t sure what to tell her. It seemed too soon to describe the relationship as serious. Until he knew whether he and Faith truly had a future, he\u2019d rather keep it to himself.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d Megan said, rounding the corner of the kitchen as he stepped into the living room, pocketing his keys. His daughter arched her eyebrows in evident surprise. \u201cDon\u2019t you look good.\u201d</p><p>He grumbled something indistinct, wondering what he should say. His instincts hinted that Megan wasn\u2019t ready to hear about any other woman in his life.</p><p>Megan continued to study him, arms folded as she surveyed his attire. \u201cWhat\u2019s the occasion?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Troy shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cNothing much. I\u2019m meeting an old friend.\u201d Now was the time to mention that the \u201cold friend\u201d just happened to be female, yet he hesitated.</p> <p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say you were going on a date.\u201d</p><p>Troy frowned and shrugged again.</p><p>Megan shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t picture you dating,\u201d she said with finality. She seemed to think it was too improbable to waste time discussing.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he demanded. He might be close to retirement age but he wasn\u2019t dead.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Dad,\u201d Megan joked. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might want to start dating again,\u201d he informed her. \u201cEventually...\u201d He didn\u2019t find her attitude the least bit encouraging. Nor was he amused.</p> <p>\u201cNo way!\u201d His daughter looked shocked, her response even more uncompromising than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s only been dead a short while!\u201d</p><p>No one needed to tell him that. \u201cI\u2019m well aware of when your mother died.\u201d He didn\u2019t remind Megan that Sandy had been ill for years beforehand. Not once in all those years had he so much as looked at another woman. He\u2019d been faithful to the very end.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right,\u201d Megan said stubbornly, her smile fading. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t do that, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d he returned, struggling to disguise his feelings.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, it wouldn\u2019t be right,\u201d she repeated, more loudly this time. \u201cPeople would talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t live my life based on other people\u2019s opinions,\u201d he said, his voice sharp with frustration and annoyance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be dishonoring Mom\u2019s memory.\u201d Megan was noticeably upset. \u201cGood grief, Dad, it\u2019s barely been two months! You don\u2019t honestly mean\u2014do you\u2014that you\u2019re going out on a date? That\u2019s just...wrong.\u201d Her eyes, so like Sandy\u2019s, filled with horror.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d he said, his tone as soothing as he could make it.</p><p>Megan immediately relaxed. She smiled again, unable to hide her relief. \u201cThank goodness. For a minute there, you had me worried.\u201d</p><p>Troy sighed. No point in asking his daughter\u2019s opinion on the matter of seeing Faith. She\u2019d made her feelings completely clear. As far as Megan was concerned, everything should remain exactly the way it was.</p><p>\u201cI stopped by to see if you\u2019d come for dinner,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to suggest tonight, but I know you\u2019ve already got plans\u2014with your friend.\u201d Her face revealed her distress. \u201cI should\u2019ve asked you sooner, but it never dawned on me that you might be doing something.\u201d She bit her lip, then made an effort to pretend it wasn\u2019t important. \u201cThat\u2019s what I get for taking my dad for granted.\u201d</p><p>More than anything Troy hated to disappoint his daughter. \u201cWhat are you having?\u201d he forced himself to ask.</p><p>\u201cSteamed clams and fresh crab I picked up at the Farmer\u2019s Market this afternoon. Craig\u2019s got everything in a huge pot, along with freshly picked corn and new potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you celebrating?\u201d</p><p>A smile turned up the corners of her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to wait and see. Is there any way you could make it?\u201d</p><p>Why, oh, why hadn\u2019t he left the house ten minutes ago? Then he wouldn\u2019t have been here and Megan wouldn\u2019t have known anything about his plans.</p><p>\u201cCan you, Dad?\u201d Her eyes shone with hope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to make a phone call first.\u201d The words nearly stuck in his throat. If there was any alternative, he would\u2019ve taken it. Yes, Megan was spoiled; he admitted that. He guessed it was natural enough, since she was an only child and cherished by both parents. In addition to that, he and Megan had been through so much together during Sandy\u2019s illness. They\u2019d grown close and solicitous of each other\u2019s feelings. Although Megan obviously had her limits...</p><p>\u201cOh, Dad.\u201d Megan sniffed and her eyes were wet with tears. \u201cI wanted to save it as a surprise, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave what?\u201d he asked, trying to pretend that changing his dinner plans was no big thing.</p><p>\u201cMy news,\u201d she said. He could tell she was trying hard to keep her voice even.</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t know what to think.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pregnant!\u201d she cried, and then she allowed the tears to slip down her cheeks. \u201cCraig and I are going to make you a grandpa.\u201d</p><p>It took Troy a moment to grasp this. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a baby?\u201d</p><p>She nodded enthusiastically and started to laugh again, still weeping. \u201cI\u2019m almost two months. Can you believe it? It must\u2019ve happened shortly after Mom died, when I was so upset and...and missing her so much. Don\u2019t you see, Dad?\u201d</p><p>Troy wasn\u2019t sure what he was supposed to see.</p><p>\u201cThis baby is Mom\u2019s last gift to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent this baby to me because she knew how lonely I\u2019d be. Mom knew a baby would help me face the future without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He was touched by how childlike she sounded\u2014and a little worried, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re happy for us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, reaching out and touching his sleeve, silently imploring him.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d he said and gathered her in his arms. \u201cI am. I\u2019m thrilled for you. For all of us.\u201d He paused. \u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI feel wonderful. Craig\u2019s so excited. Me, too. At first I could hardly believe it. I\u2019ve been on the pill ever since we got married. I just went off it a few months ago, and...\u201d</p><p>This was information he didn\u2019t need to hear, the type of thing Megan should be discussing with her mother. But he\u2019d been standing in for Sandy so long, it probably seemed natural for his daughter to share the intimate details of her marriage with him.</p><p>\u201cI stopped taking them when Mom got\u2014when it became obvious we wouldn\u2019t have her with us very much longer,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cI just forgot....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you can understand why I said this baby is Mom\u2019s last gift to me.\u201d</p><p>Troy patted her back. The pregnancy was exciting news, and Sandy, had she lived, would\u2019ve been over the moon at the prospect of being a grandmother.</p><p>\u201cWhat time do you want me at the house?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>\u201cSeven,\u201d Megan said, breaking away from him. \u201cI don\u2019t think doing it tomorrow night is a good idea with the clams and the crab.\u201d</p><p>Troy agreed they shouldn\u2019t delay. \u201cI\u2019ll call my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>Megan hadn\u2019t called him Daddy in years. Generally it was Dad. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in an hour,\u201d she said, hurrying toward the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d he assured her. Then, remembering his manners, he asked. \u201cDo you want me to bring anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...oh, Dad, please don\u2019t let on that you know about the baby. Craig\u2019s parents are coming, and I don\u2019t want to ruin the surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it.\u201d So the in-laws would be there, too. Funny Megan hadn\u2019t thought to mention that earlier. Not that it would\u2019ve mattered. She had no reason to think he might have made other plans, since he rarely did anything outside of work. There hadn\u2019t been room for anyone in his life except Sandy and of course Megan\u2014until now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Troy watched Megan pull out of the driveway and head down the street before he walked over to the phone. Without needing to look up Faith\u2019s number, he punched it in.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d She answered after the first ring, her voice cheerful.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, bracing himself to tell her the unhappy news.</p><p>\u201cTroy! Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re in the neighborhood already. Not that it\u2019s a problem. I\u2019m as ready as I\u2019ll ever be. I\u2019m afraid I went overboard with dinner,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI baked fresh rolls from a recipe that was my grandmother\u2019s. I can\u2019t remember the last time I used that recipe. Thanksgiving, I think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFaith...\u201d All he could do was blurt out the truth. \u201cListen, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the chocolate cake I made before you left for basic training?\u201d she asked, not letting him finish.</p><p>\u201cYou baked a cake, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I hardly ever bake these days. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much point when it\u2019s just me. I\u2019d nearly forgotten how much I enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>He felt dreadful. \u201cFaith,\u201d he said, unable to hide his disappointment. \u201cI can\u2019t come.\u201d</p> <p>The line went silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he added, \u201csorrier than I can say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething came up?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure how much to tell her. \u201cYes. Something...important.\u201d</p><p>She paused and seemed to regroup. \u201cThese things happen, Troy. So much for the best-laid plans,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Megan, my daughter,\u201d he explained. \u201cShe just found out she\u2019s pregnant. She\u2019s invited me to dinner to celebrate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTroy, that\u2019s wonderful news!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThe invitation came at the last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course you have to join your daughter and her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you give me a rain check on dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate how kind you\u2019re being about this,\u201d he told her and meant it. Faith had apparently spent the entire day cooking in anticipation of their evening together.</p><p>\u201cTroy, have dinner with your daughter tonight. I understand completely. Don\u2019t worry about it for a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His gratitude made him feel lighthearted and almost giddy. Faith was every bit as compassionate, as good, as he remembered. He looked forward to seeing her again\u2014seeing what the future held.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout those rolls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they freeze well?\u201d</p><p>Her soft laugh was like balm on a wound. \u201cThey do. I\u2019ll put them in the freezer now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it to a sick friend of mine,\u201d she said. \u201cNeither of us needs to be indulging in sweets, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Troy would\u2019ve given just about anything to be with Faith tonight. Instead he\u2019d smile and make polite conversation with his daughter\u2019s in-laws. It wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d imagined this evening, but Megan was his child; she had to come first. Besides, there\u2019d be other nights for him and Faith.</p><p>He was counting on that.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Bobby Polgar knew one thing for sure: he wasn\u2019t going to risk losing his wife because of a chess match. Vladimir had done his best, but Bobby was unwilling to fall in with the Russian\u2019s plans.</p><p>Bobby had to give the other player credit. Aleksandr Vladimir understood that Teri was Bobby\u2019s weakness. Nothing on this earth, not his titles, not his money, was worth putting the woman he loved in jeopardy.</p><p>\u201cBobby,\u201d Teri called to him from the bedroom, her voice husky with sleep. \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night. Why aren\u2019t you in bed?\u201d</p><p>He could hear her moving around in their main-floor room and looked away from the chessboard he was studying. He was tired, so his thinking wasn\u2019t as clear as it should be.</p><p>Teri ambled into the den where he sat. She wore a short black nightie made of silk that instantly reminded him of the pleasures of the marriage bed. Her hair, dark brown this week, was mussed and she covered her mouth with one hand as she yawned widely.</p><p>\u201cI woke up and you weren\u2019t there,\u201d she complained. Her gaze fell on the chessboard and she shook her head. \u201cHow can you play like that?\u201d She sounded perplexed. \u201cWithout chess pieces, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI play in my head.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Bobby frowned, not understanding her question.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She held her hand out to him. \u201cCome back to bed, okay?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he abandoned his chessboard and returned to the bedroom with his wife. He doubted he\u2019d be able to sleep. The moves in his head continued whether he was in front of the board or not.</p><p>Once under the sheets, Teri nestled close to his side. \u201cCan we talk for a minute?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think dinner with my sister went well, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He did, but they both knew it wasn\u2019t the meal that had brought Christie back to their home. The real attraction was James Wilbur. He\u2019d been with Bobby for nearly ten years. Although James was employed by Bobby, he was also his friend. A true friend, one of the few. They\u2019d always maintained a professional decorum, but they understood each other. However, when it came to the subject of Christie Levitt, James had remained suspiciously silent.</p><p>\u201cDid you see how long it took him to get back to the house after he dropped Christie off last night?\u201d James lived in roomy private quarters above the garage.</p><p>Bobby hadn\u2019t noticed. \u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d His wife giggled. \u201cJames and my sister.\u201d She sighed expansively as she rested her head on his chest. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly not her usual kind of guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, too.\u201d</p><p>He felt Teri\u2019s nod.</p><p>\u201cJames told me there\u2019s an important chess match this weekend,\u201d she said after a moment.</p><p>Bobby knew all about the match, which was being held in Los Angeles. He\u2019d already made his decision. \u201cI\u2019ve declined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby!\u201d</p><p>The organizers were pressuring him to take part, but much as he wanted to play, as much as he needed the challenge, he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBobby, there\u2019s got to be a way,\u201d Teri insisted. \u201cI won\u2019t let Vladimir steal your title by threatening me.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter. Bobby refused to comply with the Russian\u2019s demands. He knew he was the better player, and Vladimir knew it, too. That was the reason he\u2019d gone to such lengths to ensure victory.</p><p>Aleksandr Vladimir had given Bobby his instructions: The next match in which they competed, Bobby was to lose. It couldn\u2019t appear deliberate; he had to fall into a trap known as the Black Hole. Once the eleven moves had been played, the game was over. So far, no one had ever escaped that trap but Bobby believed it was possible. He spent day and night reviewing those first eleven moves, looking for a back door, a way to win despite Vladimir\u2019s threat. The solution was there. He was close to finding it, which was why he couldn\u2019t sleep, why he\u2019d spent hour after hour staring at an empty chessboard.</p><p>\u201cJames said,\u201d Teri continued, \u201cthat unless you play in this tournament, you\u2019ll lose your ranking as the top international player.\u201d</p><p>At one time, his ranking had been of supreme importance to him. That wasn\u2019t true now.</p><p>\u201cI want you to attend the tournament,\u201d Teri said, snuggling up to him. Her fingers stroked his chest. \u201cThis is important, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, unwilling to let her sway his decision. He had to keep his queen safe. If, during the course of the competition, Bobby was paired against Aleksandr Vladimir, which would almost certainly happen, he wouldn\u2019t have any choice but to throw the game. He wasn\u2019t prepared, hadn\u2019t perfected his escape from the Black Hole.</p><p>\u201cBobby.\u201d She whispered his name in a throaty voice he\u2019d come to recognize.</p><p>His answer was to turn his face away from her.</p><p>She flattened her hand against his chest, then caught his earlobe between her teeth. Sparks flew down his back and he closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll play Vladimir when I\u2019m ready, Teri. Not yet, but soon.\u201d</p><p>He could tell by the way her body tensed that she wasn\u2019t pleased with his answer. He kissed the side of her face and brought her closer. \u201cSoon,\u201d he promised again. When he\u2019d figured out how to beat Vladimir at his own game and protect Teri.</p><p>Vladimir would be furious if Bobby didn\u2019t make an appearance at this next match. Still, the idea of thwarting the other man gave him a sense of control, however short-lived or illusory that might be.</p><p>Stretching, Teri arched her back and within minutes was sound asleep. Bobby stroked her hair. She was his queen, his love, and she mattered above all else.</p><p>Soon after, Bobby drifted off to sleep. When he woke, the sun was bright, and he could hear his wife singing in the shower. Her talents weren\u2019t vocal, yet he enjoyed listening to her.</p><p>Waltzing back into the bedroom, still singing, Teri had the towel wrapped around her as she opened their walk-in closet. He couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>She stopped when she saw him watching. \u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose my singing\u2019s responsible for that.\u201d</p><p>He loved the fact that Teri\u2019s moods rarely fluctuated. Almost always she was happy. Optimistic. And just being with her made him happy, too.</p><p>\u201cWould you like a good-morning kiss?\u201d she asked, moving toward the bed.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d If he was lucky, that kiss would turn into something more. He wasn\u2019t an experienced lover, but he was learning. Teri had instructed him on how to satisfy her, although she\u2019d intuitively known how to please him. The enjoyment he derived from giving her pleasure still surprised him and seemed to increase his own sexual satisfaction a hundredfold.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, Teri slipped her arms around his neck and lowered her mouth to his. Even after all these months, her kisses stunned him. He couldn\u2019t think when Teri was in his arms. Bobby\u2019s way of dealing with the world was cerebral, not emotional. Only with Teri did he allow himself to feel.</p><p>When they\u2019d finished kissing, Teri released a deep sigh. \u201cNo one told me married life would be this good. It\u2019s not the sex,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cAlthough that\u2019s terrific\u2014don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s the...being together. Trusting each other. You know?\u201d</p><p>Bobby murmured, \u201cYes. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d better get ready. Rachel and I\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly and Bobby felt her anxiety.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Rachel?\u201d</p><p>Teri raised her head. \u201cNothing. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess in a way I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Bobby wished he could think of something more useful to say. But most people simply confused him. Outside of Teri and James, the only other men and women in his life were chess players like him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRachel\u2019s seeing Nate soon,\u201d Teri went on to explain.</p><p>Bobby searched his mind until he remembered that Nate was the navy guy Teri\u2019s friend was involved with.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good?\u201d</p><p>His wife shrugged helplessly. \u201cShe thinks it is, but I\u2019m not sure.\u201d When Bobby frowned, she said, \u201cI\u2019m positive Bruce Peyton\u2019s in love with her. Only he won\u2019t say anything....\u201d</p> <p>That was foolish, in Bobby\u2019s view. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s a widower, and he and Rachel have been friends for years. But I can tell you that if he doesn\u2019t act quickly, Bruce is going to lose her and that would be a shame.\u201d</p><p>Bobby could understand the fear of losing someone. He loved Teri; he needed her. He\u2019d be devastated if she left him\u2014or something happened to her.</p><p>Teri stood up, tucking the towel more securely around her, then started toward the closet.</p><p>He wished she\u2019d drop the towel. Bobby liked watching her body. It was soft and generous, the way she was.</p> <p>\u201cBobby Pin,\u201d she said, whirling around. \u201cTalk to James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know what\u2019s going on with him and my sister.\u201d</p><p>Ah, so that was it. \u201cIf anything.\u201d</p><p>Teri\u2019s eyes twinkled with delight. \u201cTrust me, my darling, there\u2019s plenty going on. Be discreet about it, though. Subtle.\u201d</p><p>Bobby wouldn\u2019t recognize subtle if it handed him a calling card. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p> <p>When Teri stepped out of the closet, she was fully dressed in tailored white pants and a sleeveless blue sweater. She looked as if she was ready to walk out the door and when she reached for her purse, Bobby knew he\u2019d guessed right.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it too early for work?\u201d</p><p>Teri returned to the bed. \u201cThe hair show in Seattle is today,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember? Rachel and I will be gone until dinnertime.\u201d</p><p>Bobby didn\u2019t like the thought of his wife being out of his sight for that long. Arguing with her, however, would be pointless. He had to trust that she\u2019d be safe, and at least she and Rachel would be together.</p><p>Leaning forward, she kissed him deeply, making him all the more reluctant to release her. \u201cTalk to James, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not driving you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time. Rachel\u2019s picking me up. We\u2019ll grab breakfast on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBobby!\u201d</p><p>The expression on her face indicated more clearly than words that this discussion was over. Teri didn\u2019t understand the danger she was in. Vladimir was not a man to trifle with; his one consolation was that the Russian would be in Los Angeles for the chess tournament.</p><p>Rachel arrived soon afterward, and the two of them drove off. Bobby spent his morning on the Internet following the chess match in California. More than once he had to close his eyes. The lure of the game, the competition, was as powerful as any drug. He missed it.</p><p>At lunchtime he remembered his promise to Teri and asked James to bring the car around. Bobby walked out to find his car parked by the front door, his driver standing dutifully beside it.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d James asked, as Bobby climbed in.</p><p>\u201cJust a few questions, James,\u201d Bobby said from the back. Teri had said he needed to be subtle.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Inside the car James had turned around, hands on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about Teri\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>The back of James\u2019s neck went beet-red. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri was thinking of inviting her for dinner again.\u201d That was subtle, wasn\u2019t it? Bobby was proud of his artfulness.</p><p>\u201cVery good, sir. Shall I pick her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>He could see James\u2019s fingers clenching the wheel. \u201cOf course not. When would you like me to get Miss Christie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Bobby hesitated. \u201cShe\u2019s a lot like Teri, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>James met his eyes in the rearview mirror. \u201cIn what way, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>James cleared his throat. \u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed that.\u201d</p><p>A lie if ever Bobby had heard one. \u201cDo you get along with her, James?\u201d he asked, deciding the direct approach might work best, after all.</p><p>The other man\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cUnfortunately not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot?\u201d Bobby was certain he\u2019d misunderstood.</p><p>\u201cWe seem...I\u2019m afraid, sir, that Miss Christie has taken a dislike to me.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the impression Teri had gotten. \u201cIs there any particular reason?\u201d</p><p>James shifted and raised both hands. \u201cI believe she doesn\u2019t like men who are formal in manner and who are employed as drivers.\u201d</p><p>This was shocking news. \u201cI\u2019m s-sorry to hear that, James,\u201d he stuttered, wondering if Christie was really such a superficial snob. If that was the case, she was nothing like Teri at all.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d he stated crisply.</p><p>The two men sat in the car for a few more minutes, neither of them speaking, before Bobby realized that James expected to drive him somewhere. \u201cThat will be all, James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, sir.\u201d</p><p>His driver emerged from the vehicle, came to the back door and opened it for Bobby, who returned to the house. He was in front of his computer, eating a cheese sandwich, when someone pounded hard on the door.</p><p>Bobby answered it and discovered James standing there. Looking pale and shaken, the driver handed Bobby an envelope. \u201cOne of Vladimir\u2019s men dropped this off. He said I was to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>A chill went down Bobby\u2019s spine as he tore open the envelope\u2014a chill that intensified when he saw what was inside. A gold medal imprinted with the image of an angel, similar to one Teri owned.</p><p>All at once Bobby\u2019s breath caught in his throat.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t similar to Teri\u2019s; this was hers.</p><p>For a moment his vocal cords refused to work. When he finally managed to speak, he looked at James. \u201cWe have to contact Teri. Now.\u201d Uttering those few simple words required monumental effort.</p><p>James fumbled for his cell. It seemed to take him an inordinate amount of time to press the appropriate number in the speed-dial function. Bobby held his breath while he waited for Teri to respond. As soon as she did, he was able to breathe again, to speak. To move.</p><p>\u201cBobby!\u201d Teri sounded excited to hear from him. \u201cDid you talk to James about my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your angel necklace?\u201d he asked, ignoring her question.</p><p>\u201cOh, Bobby, for Pete\u2019s sake, I\u2019m wearing it.\u201d She muttered something he couldn\u2019t understand. He could hear some rustling and then she gasped. \u201cBobby! I seem to have lost it. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019d misplace that. I distinctly remember putting it on....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, right after I got out of the shower. I wear it quite often. Did you find it? Is that why you\u2019re calling?\u201d</p><p>The chill he\u2019d experienced earlier became an icy blast that froze his blood. Bobby understood the message. Vladimir had expected him in Los Angeles, and Bobby\u2019s efforts to thwart him hadn\u2019t gone unnoticed. This was his way of telling Bobby that he could get to Teri whenever he wanted.</p><p>\u201cBobby, you\u2019re not answering me.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. Instead he passed the phone to James. The only option he had was to await further instructions. When the time came, he would do what was asked of him, even if it meant walking away a loser.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Linnette McAfee\u2019s eyes stung as she pulled away from her parents\u2019 home on Harbor Street</p><p>. The farewell with her sister Gloria earlier in the afternoon had been just as hard. They\u2019d all kept her with them as long as they could. Her mother, especially, didn\u2019t want her to leave Cedar Cove, but in the end had accepted Linnette\u2019s decision. It might be an unreasonable one, but it was hers to make.</p><p>Linnette had listened to all of her family\u2019s arguments and she understood what they\u2019d explained over and over again. Okay, so she was running away. Okay, so leaving town wouldn\u2019t work, wouldn\u2019t solve her problems. She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Linnette didn\u2019t know anything about Will Jefferson other than that he was Charlotte Rhodes\u2019s son and Olivia Griffin\u2019s brother. Will had sublet her apartment and she\u2019d felt like kissing him in gratitude. Even if he hadn\u2019t taken over her lease, she would\u2019ve left Cedar Cove. His opportune appearance meant she wouldn\u2019t lose a chunk of her savings paying rent on a place she wasn\u2019t living in.</p><p>What particularly distressed her parents was Linnette\u2019s lack of a destination. She\u2019d drive until she was tired of driving, tired of being on the road. As her mother had repeatedly pointed out, this was the most irresponsible action of her life.</p><p>Linnette agreed. But the thing no one seemed to grasp was how freeing that felt, how liberating it was not to answer to anyone. All her life she\u2019d been Ms. Responsibility. She\u2019d gone directly from high school into college and then into the Physician Assistant program. From the age of five, all she\u2019d done was study and work. No big vacations, no time off for good grades\u2014or good behavior. Nothing.</p><p>Beyond anything else, the painful breakup with Cal had taught her that this would continue to be her lot in life unless she did something drastic. So she had.</p><p>As Linnette entered Highway 16 past Olalla, her cell phone rang. Normally she wouldn\u2019t have answered. She knew it was dangerous to drive and chat on her cell. At any other time she would\u2019ve let voice mail catch the call. Not this afternoon.</p><p>\u201cHi. This is Linnette,\u201d she sang out, doing her utmost to sound completely happy and carefree. She wasn\u2019t, but there was a lot to be said for pretending.</p><p>\u201cLinnette? You really did it, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMack?\u201d Of all people, she thought her brother would understand. He hadn\u2019t been able to attend the farewell dinner at her parents\u2019 because of training obligations and she was pleased to hear from him.</p><p>\u201cI just got off the phone with Mom,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWas she still bemoaning my decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d He gave a wry chuckle. \u201cYou said you were packing up and heading out, but I didn\u2019t really believe you\u2019d do it.\u201d</p><p>That was another problem. No one took her seriously. Even her family and close friends hadn\u2019t believed she\u2019d actually follow through. She knew why, too. Linnette McAfee had always been so darned conscientious and dependable. So goody-goody, so...predictable.</p><p>\u201cYup, I\u2019m out of here,\u201d she said, forcing a note of glee into her voice.</p><p>There was a short silence. \u201cMom says you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I figure I\u2019ll know when I get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly my point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sounds more like something I\u2019d do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does.\u201d She\u2019d always envied her brother his individuality and his courage. He\u2019d been a nonconformist from the time he was in grade school. For years there\u2019d been trouble between Mack and their dad; only recently had father and son come to a mutual understanding. Linnette, for one, was relieved that they\u2019d worked things out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop by and see me, will you?\u201d Mack suggested. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were at the FireTrainingAcademy in North Bend,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis was our last day. Let\u2019s celebrate\u2014I\u2019ll treat you to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Mack treat her? That was a laugh. Her brother was constantly broke. Besides, she wasn\u2019t even ten miles out of Cedar Cove and already her family was weighing her down, pulling her back. \u201cI...I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Mack demanded. \u201cYou weren\u2019t on any schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Linnette sighed. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll meet you\u2014on one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, I\u2019ll buy,\u201d her brother insisted. \u201cThen you\u2019ll owe me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMack, if you say a single word about me leaving Cedar Cove or bring up Cal and Vicki, I swear to you I\u2019ll walk out of the restaurant. Now, where should I meet you?\u201d Since he\u2019d offered to pay, he\u2019d probably choose a fast-food joint.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to say a single word about the impulsive nature of your decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d After a few minutes of discussion they decided to meet at a Chinese restaurant in old downtown Issaquah. Neither had dined there before, but Mack had heard good things about the food, which was said to be plentiful and cheap. Cheap being the operative word in this case.</p><p>Mack was sitting in a booth, sipping tea, when Linnette arrived. He saluted her with the cup when she entered. She looked forward to spending a couple of hours with her brother, but she meant what she\u2019d said earlier. One word about her decision or Cal and she\u2019d walk out.</p><p>Mack looked good, she had to admit. Better than just about any time in the past few years. He seemed genuinely happy, and she suspected that he\u2019d finally found his real calling. After she\u2019d studied the menu and they\u2019d ordered, Mack told her about his training.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re qualified to be a real fireman now?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cSo they tell me.\u201d</p><p>Her brother had held any number of jobs through the years. He\u2019d delivered mail, worked for a moving company, been an apartment manager, a bouncer and at one time, a painter.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a line on a job?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Mack smiled a bit sheepishly. \u201cDad told me there\u2019s another opening in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously want to be that close to Mom and Dad?\u201d Although Mack and their father seemed to get along now, Linnette wasn\u2019t convinced that living in such close vicinity was a smart idea.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d her brother told her. \u201cI\u2019m putting in my application there and another in LakeStevens and a third in Spokane.\u201d</p><p>Spokane was on the other side of the state, which meant that both Linnette and her brother would no longer live near their parents.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be good for Gloria, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Linnette said. The situation in their family was an unusual one. Since Gloria had grown up with adoptive parents, she didn\u2019t have the same childhood experiences Linnette and Mack did, or the same memories; in effect, she\u2019d been a stranger to them. The fact that Linnette was already friends with Gloria had only added to the sense of unreality. So much had happened in the past two years and now, with Cal, it all felt overwhelming.</p> <p>\u201cGloria\u2019s going to miss you, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to miss her, Mack. And Mom and Dad. And you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to do just fine,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d She hadn\u2019t intended to be so defiant. \u201cI\u2019m going to be more than fine. I\u2019m going to be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sound a lot like my brother, don\u2019t I?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cMore power to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPower to the people!\u201d she chanted.</p><p>Mack nearly choked on his tea and soon Linnette was laughing, too. This brother-sister bantering was exactly what she\u2019d needed after the emotional farewell scene with her parents.</p><p>Mack set down his chopsticks and pushed away his plate of Szechuan chicken. \u201cI had a reason for wanting to see you before you left. Besides wishing you well, of course.\u201d</p><p>Linnette stopped him with one raised hand. \u201cI meant what I said earlier, Mack. If this has anything to do with Cal, then save your breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d He inhaled and paused for a moment, as if to gather his thoughts. \u201cListen, I just want you to know that if you ever need help, you can call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really nice, Mack....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Linnette. Don\u2019t brush me off, all right? There might come a time when you\u2019re low on cash and you don\u2019t want to contact Mom and Dad.\u201d</p><p>Linnette almost laughed. For most of his adult life, Mack had lived hand to mouth. The fact that he was paying for their meal surprised her, especially since he was currently unemployed.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, but Mack, I wouldn\u2019t want you to take out a loan on my behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have money?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help sounding flippant; everyone knew Mack lived one step above poverty level.</p><p>\u201cI have enough,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cIf you need anything, you call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I need more than fifty dollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette, would you stop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have more than fifty dollars you can spare?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cMore than a hundred?\u201d</p><p>Again he nodded.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred?\u201d This was fascinating information.</p><p>\u201cMore than a thousand,\u201d he said.</p><p>Linnette pressed her palms against the table and leaned forward. \u201cThis is a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that I can help you if you need it.\u201d</p><p>She eyed her brother, still unable to believe he\u2019d managed to hang on to a thousand dollars. Mack? \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d he asked unnecessarily. \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>She gestured weakly. \u201cSatisfy my curiosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have enough to provide you with a buffer if necessary,\u201d was all he seemed willing to tell her. \u201cThe transmission on your car could go out in some podunk town and I don\u2019t want you stressed out about how you\u2019d pay to get it repaired. Call me and I\u2019ll take care of it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d probably cost more than a thousand bucks.\u201d She had no idea how much money he had, but it couldn\u2019t be that much. If Mack had won the lottery she would\u2019ve heard about it. And surely he wouldn\u2019t be driving that rattletrap truck if he had any other option.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to rest until you wrangle it out of me, are you?\u201d Mack said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s close to six figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out of here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking, Linnette.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he had won the lottery and somehow kept it a secret. \u201cHow...when?\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not a day trader, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cThen how did you come by that kind of money? Hey\u2014\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cDid you receive an inheritance and I wasn\u2019t in the will? Grandma McAfee always did like you best.\u201d</p><p>Mack laughed outright at that. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, don\u2019t you think I could\u2019ve earned it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, no.\u201d</p><p>He waggled his finger at her. \u201cOh, ye of little faith. Anyway, you\u2019re wrong. I bought a broken-down house, spent every penny I could scrounge to fix it up and sold it for a nice profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two years ago.\u201d</p><p>Linnette remembered that house. It\u2019d been a real dump, and at the time she\u2019d assumed he was renting.</p><p>\u201cThere, are you satisfied?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re really something.\u201d</p><p>Mack returned her grin with one of his own. \u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant it as one.\u201d Linnette settled back against the booth and looked at her brother with fresh eyes. Not only had he held on to his money, he\u2019d kept quiet about it until now. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Mack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but there\u2019s more to it. Despite all the arguments we got into while we were growing up, you care about me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her words seemed to astonish him. \u201cOf course I do! You\u2019re my kid sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour kid sister who\u2019s about to start a brand-new life,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cDo it with confidence, Linnette. Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019ve got a safety net with me.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in her family had fought her on this decision. Everyone except Mack. He understood her reasons and had offered unexpected sympathy\u2014and help.</p><p>He was everything an older brother should be.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>The morning hadn\u2019t begun well for Grace Harding. She\u2019d awakened late after a fitful night and then had to rush about the house, making coffee, collecting her books and papers, preparing for work. Cliff hadn\u2019t been the least bit helpful and had wanted her to stay in bed. His timing couldn\u2019t have been worse; she had to be at the library by nine, since she was opening for the day. She scurried about the bedroom, dressing as fast as she could, and all the while Cliff made a point of telling her that she didn\u2019t need to work. In fact, he\u2019d like her to consider retiring.</p><p>Of course she needed to work! Grace was the head librarian, and she loved her job. She\u2019d reminded Cliff of that on her way out the door and was almost at the library before she remembered that she\u2019d left the house without kissing him goodbye.</p><p>Now the morning was half gone and that sense of urgency had yet to leave her. She felt disoriented and disorganized; when she arrived in Bremerton for a meeting with the selector, the librarian who ordered new books, she discovered she\u2019d forgotten that set of notes at home. The meeting ended up being a waste of time, and it was her fault.</p><p>When Grace returned to the Cedar Cove branch, she had to admit she was giving Cliff\u2019s suggestion that she retire due consideration. One way or another, she\u2019d been working her entire adult life. After the girls were born, she\u2019d taken night classes at Olympic Community College. Later she\u2019d transferred to the University of Washington for her library science degree. Upon graduation she\u2019d been fortunate enough to be hired by the local library.</p><p>Those early years had been good for her and Dan. He\u2019d helped with the children and given her his support as she went back to school. Despite their financial constraints and the problems that haunted Dan, Grace knew he loved her as much as he could love anyone. It was once Maryellen and Kelly started school and grew older that his dark moods became intolerable. They hung over their marriage and family life and had grown progressively worse until the end, just before he\u2019d disappeared.</p><p>It was difficult to think about her marriage to Dan and not feel a sense of grief and loss. Grace didn\u2019t understand why he was lingering in her mind on such a busy day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrace.\u201d Loretta, another librarian, stepped into her office. \u201cThere\u2019s a gentleman out front who\u2019d like to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he give you his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he said he\u2019s an old family friend. He came to apply for a library card.\u201d</p><p>In that instant Grace knew it could only be Will Jefferson.</p> <p>\u201cHe seems friendly,\u201d Loretta added.</p><p>It was inevitable, Grace supposed, that she\u2019d see Will again; it was going to happen sooner or later. Squaring her shoulders, she followed Loretta out of the office.</p><p>Sure enough, Will Jefferson leaned indolently against the counter, as though he had all the time in the world. When he saw Grace, he smiled and straightened.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s older brother had been a strikingly handsome young man, and the years hadn\u2019t changed that. He still had a rakish, self-assured air. As a teenager, Grace had the biggest crush on Will. Back then, he barely knew she was alive, which was probably why she\u2019d been so flattered when he\u2019d shown interest in her after Dan\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d Will bestowed on her the warmest of smiles. \u201cYou look wonderful, as usual.\u201d</p> <p>He was smooth, always had been. \u201cHello, Will. So you\u2019re here to apply for a library card?\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to exchange pleasantries with him, nor was she willing to make him feel welcome. If he wanted a library card, he could get one without her assistance.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you knew I was in town,\u201d Will continued, obviously undaunted by her curtness.</p><p>\u201cI heard about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume Olivia told you.\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t respond. \u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, as a matter of fact, there is,\u201d Will said with all the charm at his disposal. \u201cHow about having lunch with me? We\u2019ve got a few things to discuss and it would be good if we cleared the air.\u201d</p> <p>This was exactly what Grace could never allow. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, I\u2019m married.\u201d</p><p>Will frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to lunch as a date or to upset your husband. It just seems that if the two of us are going to be living in the same town, it might be best to talk about what happened. I know you have regrets and for that matter, so do I.\u201d</p><p>He sounded sincere and for a moment Grace wavered.</p><p>\u201cCliff isn\u2019t the jealous type, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said, refusing to let him imply that Cliff was possessive and unreasonable. \u201cBut I have nothing to say to you. Your sister\u2019s my best friend and other than that, we have nothing in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Will murmured. \u201cI can accept that.\u201d He seemed disappointed. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019ve rented an apartment on the Cove, near WaterfrontPark.\u201d</p><p>Somehow she wasn\u2019t surprised to learn that he\u2019d be living five minutes from the library.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been a voracious reader,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In other words, he was informing her that he planned to be a frequent visitor to the library. Great. Just great.</p><p>\u201cLet me know if there\u2019s anything you need,\u201d she muttered, \u201cand I\u2019ll have someone on staff see to it.\u201d She wanted it understood that she wouldn\u2019t be at his beck and call whenever he decided to check out a book.</p><p>It felt satisfying to show Will Jefferson that she was completely over him, and had been for a long time. Unintentionally, he\u2019d taught her some valuable lessons about herself. Painful lessons. Furthermore, she wasn\u2019t going to risk her marriage over him, and the sooner he realized that, the better.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Will,\u201d she said casually. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll make good use of the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to do exactly that,\u201d he told her in a low voice. He stood there as if he had more to say.</p><p>Unwilling to listen, Grace turned away from the front desk and hurried back to her office. She discovered that her hands were trembling from the encounter. To make matters worse, Cliff still didn\u2019t know that Will had moved to Cedar Cove. She hadn\u2019t meant to keep it a secret; it was just that the subject of Will Jefferson was such an uncomfortable one between them.</p><p>That evening, Grace met Olivia for their weekly aerobics class. Afterward, her friend, who knew her so well, almost immediately asked what was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think something\u2019s wrong?\u201d Grace didn\u2019t look at her as she changed out of her workout clothes. They stood beside each other in the locker room, ignoring the other women around them. Grace bent down to untie her shoe.</p><p>\u201cFor starters, you didn\u2019t complain once during class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never complain,\u201d Grace said righteously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking, aren\u2019t you? From the second we get here, you tell me there\u2019s got to be a better way to stay in shape. And when we\u2019re out on the floor, you huff and puff as if you\u2019re about to keel over.\u201d</p><p>Grace straightened, hands on her hips. \u201cI most certainly do not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo, too.\u201d</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t keep from smiling. \u201cWe sound like we\u2019re in junior high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed and headed toward the parking lot. \u201cCliff wants me to retire,\u201d Grace said as they walked.</p><p>\u201cRetire,\u201d Olivia echoed. \u201cYou\u2019re far too young for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t about age.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stopped beside her car and gave her a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cCliff would like to travel and he wants me to join him,\u201d Grace went on.</p><p>Olivia nodded, opened her door and tossed in her gym bag. \u201cIsn\u2019t this kind of sudden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Olivia paused. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with Will, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny you should mention your brother,\u201d Grace said, unlocking her own vehicle. \u201cHe stopped by the library this morning.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s mouth instantly tightened. \u201cAnd what did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA library card. Or so he said.\u201d Grace leaned against the side of her vehicle. \u201cApparently he needed my help, because he asked to talk to me personally.\u201d</p><p>Olivia folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he invited me to lunch\u2014supposedly to talk over what happened between us. I declined. I pointed out that I\u2019m married now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already knows,\u201d Olivia muttered.</p><p>\u201cI said in no uncertain terms that I don\u2019t have any interest in renewing our relationship.\u201d Grace enjoyed telling her this part.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Olivia nodded encouragingly.</p><p>Grace felt pleased by her response, but she was still worried about Will and what he might do. \u201cI don\u2019t think my being married concerns him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should it?\u201d Olivia said in disgust. \u201cHis own marriage vows apparently didn\u2019t mean very much. According to Georgia, my brother routinely had affairs. I don\u2019t get why she put up with it for as long as she did.\u201d</p><p>Knowing she\u2019d nearly been one of those affairs distressed Grace and embarrassed her. What a fool she\u2019d been. How easily she\u2019d overlooked behavior she\u2019d known to be wrong. She\u2019d so badly wanted to believe Will that she\u2019d ignored every principle she\u2019d been raised to uphold.</p><p>\u201cHe informed me that he plans to be a frequent visitor to the library,\u201d Grace continued.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d Olivia sputtered.</p><p>\u201cI said that if he needed anything to let me know,\u201d Grace added, enjoying the look of confusion that crossed her friend\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Grace said, \u201cand then I told him I\u2019d be happy to have someone else see to it.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile came to Olivia. \u201cI\u2019m ready for some pie and coffee now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>They met five minutes later at the PancakePalace. Goldie saw them pull into the parking lot and by the time they entered the restaurant she had their coffee poured.</p><p>\u201cCoconut cream?\u201d she asked when Grace and Olivia walked in and sat down at their favorite booth.</p><p>They both nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna to take to convince you to try something other than coconut?\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for a response and, shaking her bleached-blond head, returned to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI notice you sidestepped my question,\u201d Olivia said, dropping her car keys in the side pocket of her purse. \u201cIs this talk of retirement connected to my brother\u2019s visit?\u201d</p><p>Grace mulled over the question, a little startled by Olivia\u2019s suggestion.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned retiring and then, in practically the same breath, you said that Will was at the library.\u201d</p><p>Had she? Perhaps those two things were linked and she hadn\u2019t recognized it. The idea that she might consider retirement simply to avoid Will gave her pause.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t that weak or cowardly. No, she would not let him interfere with her life, would not grant him that power.</p><p>Olivia reached for her coffee. \u201cWill has a great deal to answer for,\u201d she said grimly.</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with him,\u201d Grace insisted and she realized it was true.</p><p>Fortunately their pie was served just then, which signaled a change of subject.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Olivia savored a forkful, closing her eyes. \u201cHow\u2019d Maryellen take the news, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d Grace asked, glancing up from her own pie.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t read the newspaper this morning? The Harbor Street Gallery is closing the first of October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d If she hadn\u2019t been in such a rush this morning, Grace would\u2019ve had a chance to look at the paper. \u201cI\u2019d heard rumors, but I\u2019d hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her tomorrow and tell you what she says.\u201d This would be a major disappointment to both her daughter and son-in-law. Maryellen had been instrumental in the success of the gallery and Jon still sold some of his work there.</p><p>Grace wished Maryellen had the time, energy and financial resources to buy the gallery herself. But right now, that possibility was completely out of reach.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>This time Troy wasn\u2019t taking any chances\u2014he brought a change of clothes to the office on Friday morning, and he intended to leave precisely at five. Regardless of the Labor Day weekend traffic, he was visiting Faith.</p><p>At five o\u2019clock, as planned, he donned his clean pressed shirt and slacks, putting his uniform inside the garment bag he had with him. The way people stared, he felt almost naked walking down the hallway outside his office. You\u2019d think they\u2019d never seen him in regular clothes before, he grumbled to himself.</p><p>Now that Megan was pregnant, she seemed to need her father more than ever. He realized that despite her happiness about the baby, she was feeling vulnerable and insecure. He\u2019d had no chance to have an extended phone conversation with Faith since Megan had made her announcement. His daughter called him several times every evening, to talk about her mother, discuss baby names, ask his opinion on all kinds of pregnancy-related questions. He even wondered, almost guiltily, if she knew about him and Faith and was trying to thwart the relationship. But Megan couldn\u2019t possibly know about Faith. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he left the office, Troy drove down to South-worth and discovered that the lineup for the ferry was hours long. Too impatient to wait, he drove around instead, which meant crossing the TacomaNarrowsBridge. Traffic was bound to be heavy, but it didn\u2019t matter to Troy. He was going to see Faith. She talked more and more about moving to Cedar Cove, and he encouraged the idea.</p><p>For reasons he couldn\u2019t really explain, he was nervous. Earlier that week, when Faith had invited him to dinner, Troy had decided he\u2019d kiss her. Okay, he\u2019d kiss her if he got the signal that she wouldn\u2019t object.</p><p>He lost track of time as he drove through the steady but unobstructed traffic and was surprised to find himself at the freeway exit she\u2019d instructed him to take.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, he pulled up to the curb outside her house\u2014a two-story colonial painted white with green shutters. The porch had two large columns, with a couple of wicker chairs and a glider. The lawn was well cared for and lined with flowering bushes. Sandy had liked flowers, too, and when she\u2019d still been able to, had spent copious amounts of time maintaining their garden.</p> <p>Troy stood there, staring at the house, when the door opened and she came outside.</p><p>\u201cTroy! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He felt the warmth of her welcome all the way from her porch, and yet he remained rooted to the spot. The night before they\u2019d talked for a mere ten minutes, mostly plans for tonight, but now that he was here, he seemed to have nothing more to say.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He shoved one hand in his pocket and once again felt as awkward as a high-school kid. With his other hand he clutched the bottle of sauvignon blanc he\u2019d bought on the advice of a friend.</p><p>\u201cCome in, please.\u201d Faith gestured toward the house.</p> <p>He nodded. His mouth had gone dry and his tongue felt like it was glued to his teeth.</p><p>Looking around, he walked up the porch steps and into the entry, thrusting his wine into Faith\u2019s hand. The first thing that caught his eye was the carpeted staircase. Large framed photographs lined the wall going up the stairs\u2014graduation photos of her two children, a couple of formal family shots and a portrait of her husband. He\u2019d since learned that Carl had died of lung cancer, Troy\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t linger on the pictures. Instead, he glanced over at the living room, which was to his right. He could see that it was furnished with a sofa and a couple of matching chairs next to a brick fireplace. A few small tables. Lots of plants. That was where she led him.</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something to drink?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have coffee, tea and soda.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd wine, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, thanks,\u201d he mumbled as he sat on one of the chairs next to the fireplace. A moment of uncomfortable silence followed.</p><p>\u201cHow was the traffic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He was suddenly hot and resisted the urge to unfasten the top button of his shirt.</p> <p>\u201cI was afraid it\u2019d be bumper-to-bumper the entire way, but it looks like you made good time.\u201d</p><p>Troy had no interest in this mundane conversation. \u201cListen, Faith,\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cI\u2019d best get this over with now.\u201d He stood and paced in front of the fireplace. \u201cMy wife was sick for many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Troy, I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He was going over ground already covered. \u201cThere\u2019s never been anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be shocked if there had been.\u201d</p><p>Troy saw that he was making a mess of this. \u201cI\u2019m not eighteen anymore, Faith. I don\u2019t know about...these things.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with such sweet innocence, it was all he could do not to kiss her right then and there. \u201cJust tell me, would you?\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, if you\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t, I understand. But I don\u2019t want to spend the whole evening wondering\u2014worrying about it. So tell me now. Either way is fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Her hands were clenched tightly in her lap. \u201cI think it would be perfectly nice if we kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d All at once he felt lighter than air.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to do it now?\u201d she asked with a faint smile.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about it through dinner.\u201d</p><p>He thought she might be teasing him but he didn\u2019t take offense. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d prefer to wait.\u201d</p><p>Faith grinned. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I\u2019d like to wait, too.\u201d</p><p>Then they had a glass of wine, and the conversation flowed as naturally as it always seemed to, everything from high-school reminiscences to the books they happened to be reading.</p><p>Because the dinner she\u2019d made when he had to cancel at the last minute had gone more or less to waste, Troy insisted on taking her out. With the help of an online recommendation, he\u2019d made reservations at an upscale waterfront restaurant. The place was small and elegant, with intimate lighting and attentive waiters. Faith raved about the seafood she had, and he had to agree that his salmon, too, was exceptionally good. Afterward they went for a walk along the beach near Alki, removing their shoes and strolling hand-in-hand. He carried his shoes, with his socks stuffed inside, and felt conscious of every sensory detail\u2014the cool, firm sand, the brilliant colors of the setting sun, her enticing floral scent.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think when you got to my house this evening,\u201d Faith told him. \u201cYou looked so stern. I had this horrible feeling you\u2019d gone through all that traffic just to come and tell me you didn\u2019t want to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Troy muttered, loving the feel of her so close. Asking permission to kiss her might not have been his smoothest move, but he was glad he\u2019d done it. Now he could concentrate on her and on the anticipation of that kiss.</p><p>\u201cMight I remind you that you\u2019ve already broken my heart once,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>\u201cYou recovered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did you.\u201d She paused. \u201cTroy, we both loved our spouses, but they\u2019re gone. I\u2019m so grateful that you and I have this second chance. Grateful and excited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way. Grateful, excited and nervous.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe truth is I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t throw up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Oh, come on, Troy, you\u2019ve always been so sure of yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>The wind carried the sound of her laughter and just hearing it made him want to laugh, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m knitting a baby blanket for your daughter,\u201d Faith told him. \u201cI hope that isn\u2019t too forward of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I\u2019m sure Megan will be very pleased.\u201d Even as he spoke, Troy instinctively realized that the instant Megan learned the blanket had been knit by a woman he was dating, she\u2019d be upset. Megan needed time before she\u2019d be able to accept Faith, or anyone else for that matter, in his life. Maybe when the baby was born...He considered sharing his concern with Faith, but decided against it. He suddenly wondered how her kids felt about him.</p><p>He shook off his thoughts, and together they watched the final moments of sunset. Now. He\u2019d kiss her now. He dropped his shoes on the sand, then gently turned her into his embrace and lowered his mouth to hers. Faith slid her arms around his neck.</p><p>This was the first time in more than thirty years that Troy had kissed a woman other than his wife. He found Faith\u2019s lips moist and warm and most wonderful of all, inviting.</p><p>When he lifted his mouth from hers, he saw that she was smiling up at him. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad now, was it?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cNot bad? That\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little more like it.\u201d Perhaps he should try again, he mused, and without hesitation touched his lips to hers. The same thrilling sensation stole over him. In his opinion, this was a thousand times better than not bad or lovely. It was...he searched for the right word. Incredible came to mind, but Faith had to feel it, too, before he\u2019d risk saying that.</p><p>Her eyes were still closed when he raised his head.</p><p>\u201cPretty good,\u201d he said in an offhand manner.</p><p>\u201cPretty good?\u201d Faith echoed. \u201cPretty good?\u201d Louder this time.</p><p>\u201cAll right, it was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice?\u201d She sounded outraged.</p><p>\u201cHow about incredible?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d They scooped up their shoes, then he reached for her hand and they headed back to the parking lot. The streetlights had come on, and the usual Friday-night revelers had begun to crowd the beach.</p><p>Troy drove Faith home. Just as he had when they were in high school, he walked her to the front door.</p><p>\u201cI had a perfect evening,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAbsolutely perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d Troy said. \u201cHow about a movie next?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday?\u201d He had the day off and wanted to see her again as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Faith answered. \u201cMonday\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way Sandy and I used to do it, she\u2019d choose a movie, generally one I wouldn\u2019t have picked myself, and then the next time around, it\u2019d be my turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems fair,\u201d Faith agreed. \u201cSo who\u2019ll choose the movie this time, you or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s chivalrous of you, but since it was your idea, you should go first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can compromise. I\u2019ll check the paper and get back to you with some ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>They still hadn\u2019t decided whether to meet in Seattle or Cedar Cove, but that gave Troy a legitimate excuse to call her later. Not that he really needed an excuse...</p><p>They kissed good-night, a brief, comfortable kiss, and Troy left. As he made his way down side streets to the freeway on-ramp, he couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>The freeway traffic remained heavy, thanks no doubt to the holiday weekend. Driving back to Cedar Cove took nearly ninety minutes. As soon as he walked into the dark, silent house, he noticed the flashing red light on his phone. He checked the caller ID function; all four calls had come from his daughter. No surprise there.</p><p>It was close to eleven, too late to return Megan\u2019s call. He\u2019d phone her in the morning, when his head would be clearer and he\u2019d be better prepared to answer her questions. He\u2019d tell her enough to satisfy her curiosity for the moment, but he wouldn\u2019t lie.</p><p>As he started toward his bedroom, the phone rang again. Apparently Megan wasn\u2019t going to let this rest.</p><p>\u201cYes, Megan,\u201d he said, recognizing the number. Who else would be calling him this late at night? Well, except for work, of course.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Craig,\u201d his son-in-law said in a flat tone. \u201cI just got back from the hospital.\u201d He hesitated and Troy could hear him taking a deep breath. \u201cMegan lost the baby.\u201d</p><p>Troy felt as if he\u2019d had a fist slammed into his belly. The first word out of his mouth was \u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.... We tried to reach you. Apparently you had your cell turned off.\u201d</p><p>Troy hadn\u2019t bothered to check. \u201cI was...out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMegan\u2019s taking the miscarriage pretty hard.\u201d</p><p>Troy felt the sudden need to sit down. \u201cWhat went wrong?\u201d he asked, shocked by the news.</p> <p>Sandy had lost two pregnancies after Megan, and both times the experience had been devastating. He couldn\u2019t stand that this had happened to his daughter, too.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor couldn\u2019t say for sure. Sometimes they can\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she still at the hospital?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Troy heard his daughter\u2019s tears even before she started to speak. \u201cDaddy, where were you? We tried and tried to call, and we couldn\u2019t get hold of you.\u201d Megan was sobbing in earnest now. \u201cI needed you, Daddy, I really needed you and you weren\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted this baby so much. This baby was Mom\u2019s gift to me and now...now there isn\u2019t a baby.\u201d</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t know how to comfort her, any more than he\u2019d known how to help Sandy when she\u2019d miscarried. While he\u2019d been out with Faith, sipping expensive wine in a fancy restaurant, walking on the beach, kissing her, his daughter had been at the hospital losing her baby. His grandchild.</p><p>Nineteen</p> <p>\u201cBobby wants me to cut my hours,\u201d Teri complained to Rachel as they walked along the Cedar Cove waterfront. They were on their lunch break and both felt the need to get out of the salon, into the crisp, fresh air and lovely September sunshine. Before long, the October rains would come and warm, bright days such as this would be rare.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want?\u201d Rachel asked, tossing the leftover crust from her sandwich to the seagulls.</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t reply, and Rachel glanced up from feeding the gulls.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to work part-time?\u201d Rachel repeated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want anymore,\u201d Teri confessed. \u201cI love my job, but I love Bobby, too, and he needs me more than Mrs. Johnson needs a spiral perm or Janice Hutt a color job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have your answer,\u201d Rachel said, as if the decision should be an easy one.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite that simple.\u201d Feeling queasy, Teri sat on a bench that overlooked the Cove. Baskets of blooming annuals in an array of pinks and reds hung from the lightposts along the walkway. \u201cBobby is so intense and, well...\u201d She hated to say it, but she needed a break from her husband every now and then. A few hours apart from each other did them both good. Working at the salon was the perfect arrangement.</p><p>Rachel sat down beside her, and instantly a flock of seagulls gathered at their feet. She tossed the last of the bread onto the lawn, then shooed the birds away.</p> <p>\u201cThis whole thing\u2019s giving me an upset stomach,\u201d Teri murmured. In fact, she felt like throwing up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pale,\u201d Rachel said, eyeing her closely.</p><p>\u201cDarn him.\u201d She closed her eyes as a wave of nausea swept over her. \u201cSince the hair show, Bobby\u2019s been worse than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hardly lets me out of his sight.\u201d Teri knew without looking that James was somewhere in the vicinity. He\u2019d been assigned to watch over her whenever she was away from home. To his credit, James tried to be as unobtrusive as possible. But Teri couldn\u2019t help knowing he was there, especially when he hung around the mall, peering into the salon every ten or fifteen minutes. The other girls were used to it now and tended to ignore him.</p><p>\u201cGet Nailed is more than my job,\u201d Teri continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of my social life, too. You\u2019re there and I\u2019d miss seeing you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d Rachel paused. \u201cI\u2019m actually thinking maybe Nate and I...\u201d She let the rest fade.</p><p>\u201cYou really think you might marry Nate?\u201d Teri liked the other man well enough and she knew Rachel was completely enthralled with him. But as she\u2019d told Bobby, she was unsure this was right for her friend. Apparently she wasn\u2019t the only one with doubts; Rachel seemed to have reservations herself, otherwise she would\u2019ve moved to San Diego when Nate was transferred.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to decide,\u201d Rachel said miserably. \u201cNate and I talk about it every time we\u2019re on the phone. He\u2019s coming to see me and I know he\u2019ll want an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the pressure will really be on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you love him, why the doubt?\u201d</p><p>Rachel sat back against the park bench and crossed her legs, one foot swinging. \u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m being silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel, you\u2019re my best friend! I\u2019d never be that judgmental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to do with Jolene,\u201d she said with a deep sigh. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to lose a mother. That was hard enough on the kid, but then her grandmother died, too. Bruce\u2019s family lives somewhere out east and they don\u2019t seem to have much contact. I\u2019m afraid Jolene will feel abandoned if I leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is she again?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>\u201cTwelve. She\u2019s almost ready for junior high. This is such a vulnerable age. Bruce is worried, too, and, well, I just don\u2019t feel I can do that to Jolene.\u201d</p><p>Teri understood Rachel\u2019s quandary. \u201cBut you can\u2019t base your life on Jolene.\u201d</p><p>Rachel leaned forward and uncrossed her legs. \u201cNow you sound like Nate. Jolene\u2019s gotten to be a real sore point between us. I\u2019m afraid to even mention her name because whenever I do, he gets upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bruce?\u201d Teri wondered if Jolene was the only complication.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d Teri gestured vaguely, but Rachel understood what she meant.</p><p>\u201cBruce\u2019s been acting a little weird lately.\u201d Rachel shook her head, as if to dispel thoughts of Jolene\u2019s father. \u201cRemember I told you he phoned me in the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d Teri really wasn\u2019t feeling well. In fact, her stomach seemed to be pitching like a rowboat in a squall. She did her best to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cHe did it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week. Not as late as that first night but well past the time for non-emergency calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. He didn\u2019t want anything. We talked for a few minutes, he told me Jolene\u2019s decided to run for class secretary, which I already knew because she\u2019d told me herself, and then he hung up.\u201d Rachel raised her hands in a questioning way. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might be afraid you\u2019re going to marry Nate and move to San Diego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t, would he?\u201d Teri said. Judging by her own experience, men rarely said what they meant. Neither did women, but at least they were more likely to recognize their feelings and desires; they just expressed them indirectly. Most men, on the other hand, didn\u2019t actually know what was bothering them. She figured this was the case with Bruce Peyton.</p><p>\u201cHe asked if he could come over this weekend with Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Nate was flying in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>Teri nodded. She wanted to ask what Rachel had told Bruce but suddenly felt light-headed. No longer did she think she might vomit, she knew it.</p><p>She leaped to her feet and raced toward the women\u2019s restroom. Pushing through the door, Teri barely made it inside the stall before her entire lunch came up.</p><p>\u201cTeri?\u201d Rachel followed her into the restroom. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She staggered out and leaned against the tiled wall.</p><p>\u201cMiss Teri?\u201d James called her from the doorway. \u201cEverything all right in there? Do you need me to do anything for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she yelled as she let her head fall forward. The room had started to swim. \u201cI\u2019ve got the flu,\u201d she muttered to Rachel, who handed her a wad of tissues.</p><p>\u201cThe flu?\u201d Rachel repeated with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou ought to try upchucking your lunch and see how much fun it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you have the flu,\u201d Rachel told her.</p><p>Fortunately Teri had bottled water in her purse; she rinsed out her mouth and wiped her face with the dampened tissues. \u201cWhat do you mean this isn\u2019t flu? You\u2019ve been watching too many episodes of Grey\u2019s Anatomy, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Teri, think about it. How long have you and Bobby been married?\u201d</p><p>What should have been obvious from the first suddenly became clear. Rachel was right; this nausea wasn\u2019t due to any flu virus. She was pregnant. Her cycle had always been irregular but now that she considered it, she hadn\u2019t had a period in two months. That should have been a sign. After all, they both wanted children and they weren\u2019t using protection.</p><p>\u201cTeri.\u201d Rachel placed her hand on Teri\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re going to faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Teri?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, James. Please wait outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? Should I take you to the doctor\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly he backed out of the restroom. It was a good thing no one else was in there at the moment, Teri thought. As soon as he was out of sight, she leaned against the wall again. \u201cIf Bobby\u2019s protective of me now, this news will only make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have to tell him,\u201d Rachel insisted.</p><p>\u201cI will\u2014just not yet. He\u2019s obsessive as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of those two men? But nothing\u2019s happened since.\u201d</p><p>Teri hadn\u2019t said anything, not even to Rachel. Lowering her voice, she whispered, \u201cI think it has, although Bobby didn\u2019t tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day of the hair show in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember how he called me out of the blue? He was frantic and he asked me about my necklace.\u201d She pulled the gold medal out from under her blouse. She\u2019d replaced the delicate chain at the first opportunity.</p><p>\u201cHe found it at home, right? You said you must\u2019ve forgotten to put it on.\u201d</p><p>Teri shook her head. \u201cI had it on. I distinctly remember putting it on after my shower, like I do nearly every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how would someone get it away from you without you knowing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Teri had asked herself the same question over and over. At the hair show, she\u2019d been bumped any number of times. The place was crowded. Whoever had taken her necklace had done it quickly and cleverly, snapping the fragile chain.</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone do that?\u201d Rachel asked, her own voice dropping to a whisper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s another chess player,\u201d Teri told her friend. \u201cHe wants Bobby to lose, so he\u2019s threatening me in order to get Bobby to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to go to the police,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cBobby won\u2019t. I\u2019ve already talked to him about it. He wants to take care of this himself, his own way. He promised he\u2019ll call in law enforcement but only when he has the proof he needs. The thing is, Bobby wouldn\u2019t know how to throw a match if he tried. All his life he\u2019s been trained to win. Oh, he\u2019s lost on rare occasions but it sends him into a tailspin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t risk letting anyone hurt you, though.\u201d</p> <p>Teri groaned. \u201cI know. That\u2019s why he\u2019s stopped playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s being so protective,\u201d Rachel said with dawning comprehension. \u201cTeri, this is awful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather walk out of Bobby\u2019s life right now than allow him to give up chess because of me,\u201d she muttered, wiping tears from her eyes with the sodden tissues she clutched.</p><p>\u201cOh, Teri,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cIt\u2019s so wonderful to see how much you love Bobby.\u201d</p><p>Sniffling, she nodded. She did love her husband. In fact, she\u2019d found herself weeping easily these past few weeks and she\u2019d assumed\u2014Oh, my goodness, the pregnancy explained her tears! No wonder she\u2019d been so emotional lately.</p> <p>News of a baby would panic Bobby. She didn\u2019t dare tell him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any appointments for the rest of the afternoon,\u201d Teri said, more to herself than Rachel.</p><p>\u201cAre you going home?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI think I\u2019d better. I\u2019m still not feeling well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but no. I plan to take a nap.\u201d Nothing sounded more appealing at the moment.</p> <p>James drove them back to the salon. As soon as he pulled up in front of Cedar Cove\u2019s mall, Rachel hugged her.</p><p>\u201cCall me after you see Nate,\u201d Teri said.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d James opened the door and Rachel ran lightly out.</p><p>This weekend could change her friend\u2019s life, Teri mused. She\u2019d either agree to marry Nate\u2014or not. She wasn\u2019t convinced Bruce would let himself be counted out.</p><p>On the drive home, Teri nearly fell asleep in the car. When they arrived, James helped her out, his manner even more attentive than usual.</p><p>\u201cThank you, James. And listen, what happened back there...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease keep it to yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Miss Teri.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it.\u201d She didn\u2019t want Bobby hearing about this episode from his driver. James had probably guessed she was pregnant, and she\u2019d rather Bobby didn\u2019t figure it out quite yet. That would just multiply his worries\u2014and hers.</p><p>James nodded, his hand supporting her elbow. He didn\u2019t meet her eyes.</p><p>Entering the house, she went straight to the den. As she\u2019d expected, Bobby was there, sitting in front of his chessboard.</p><p>\u201cHi, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. His thoughts were on some chess move only he could see. She kissed his cheek and without another word wandered down to their bedroom. She quickly removed her clothes, then slipped beneath the covers. The sheets felt cool against her skin and she sank her head into the pillow and closed her eyes. Almost immediately Teri fell into the welcome oblivion of sleep.</p><p>The next thing she knew, her husband was sitting on the bed, his arm around her waist. She smiled and pressed her hand over his.</p><p>\u201cThe phone rang,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear. Was it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was your sister. She got your message and said she can come to dinner next week.\u201d</p><p>Teri rolled onto her back. \u201cDid you mention that to James?\u201d</p><p>Her husband nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid he look happy?\u201d</p><p>Bobby frowned, then shook his head. \u201cNo, he looked sad.\u201d</p><p>Teri sighed. She could see that James and her sister were going to need some guidance to get this romance off the ground.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Rachel was so excited she could barely hold still. It\u2019d been almost three months since she\u2019d seen Nate and now they had a whole weekend together. A whole weekend! She paced outside the security area at Sea-TacAirport, counting the minutes until he appeared.</p><p>According to the arrivals monitor, his Alaska Airlines flight from San Diego had landed. People were streaming through, so many at a time that Rachel was afraid she\u2019d miss him.</p><p>Then he was there, standing in front of her. She let out a squeal of delight and launched herself into his arms. Her sailor man wrapped her in his embrace, swinging her around so people near them stepped out of the way, smiling. Then his hungry mouth claimed hers again and again.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nate, I\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>He held her tight, drawing in several deep breaths as though desperate to take in her scent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been on a longer flight in my life,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI kept reminding myself that every minute brought me closer to you.\u201d Slowly he released her until her shoes touched the floor again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a wonderful weekend planned,\u201d she told him, laughing. He slipped one arm around her waist, carrying his overnight bag in the other. Walking side by side, they started toward the parking garage.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of plans?\u201d He kissed her cheek as if he couldn\u2019t stop touching her now that they were finally together.</p><p>\u201cThe Puyallup Fair\u2019s on. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d It was a classic country fair, with rides, entertainment, animals and all kinds of exhibits. Rachel had often attended the fair when she was growing up; it had been one of the joys of her childhood. But she hadn\u2019t been to the Puyallup Fair in years and she thought seeing it with Nate was an inspired idea.</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was supposed to be a surprise but she couldn\u2019t keep it to herself. \u201cTwo front-row Seahawks tickets,\u201d she informed him, feeling downright smug. One of her clients, who had season tickets, was going to be out of town when the Seahawks played the Raiders and had given the tickets to Rachel. The timing of this generous gift couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. Rachel wasn\u2019t much of a sports fan, but she knew Nate loved football.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d To prove she was telling the truth, Rachel pulled the tickets from her purse. \u201cWe might have to leave the game a few minutes early so you can catch your flight Sunday evening, but that\u2019s a small thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he echoed. Nate hugged her again. \u201cI knew there was a reason I loved you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel laughed. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s all it takes...\u201d</p><p>They had dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Kent that Nate had heard about from a friend. The enchiladas were the best Rachel had ever tasted. They lingered over margaritas and talked for nearly two hours; in fact, the restaurant was closing before Rachel noticed the time and suggested they leave.</p><p>On the drive over the TacomaNarrowsBridge and home to Cedar Cove, she decided to introduce the subject of Jolene. Nate couldn\u2019t ignore the girl, as much as he might like to. Their relationship was too important to Rachel.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that Jolene\u2019s running for class secretary?\u201d she said, knowing she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>\u201cBruce is helping with her campaign, and so am I.\u201d She was intentionally probing a little, hoping he\u2019d respond with at least a show of interest.</p><p>Nate sighed and closing his eyes, rested his head against the seat, shutting her out. \u201cDo we have to talk about Bruce and Jolene?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan\u2019t tonight just be about us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it can,\u201d Rachel told him, but his indifference to Jolene hurt.</p><p>The silence between them seemed to stretch and Rachel knew it would be up to her to break it.</p><p>\u201cI have news, but I have to swear you to secrecy first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He opened his eyes and straightened.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCross your heart and hope to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. Now tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeri\u2019s pregnant,\u201d Rachel said triumphantly. \u201cThe crazy part is that I had to point it out to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Bobby think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby doesn\u2019t know, which is why it\u2019s a secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t telling her own husband?\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t want to go into the details. \u201cIt\u2019s too hard to explain. She\u2019s ecstatic, though. I have no idea how she\u2019s kept the news from Bobby. The poor girl\u2019s sick every afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought pregnant women suffered from morning sickness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Teri. She has afternoon sickness. She hasn\u2019t managed to hold down her lunch all week.\u201d</p><p>Nate shook his head. \u201cThis pregnancy might help her lose weight, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate!\u201d That was an unkind comment and she wasn\u2019t going to let him get away with it. \u201cTeri isn\u2019t fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t skinny, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Rachel frowned at him. \u201cThat was rude of you.\u201d</p><p>For the first time he seemed to notice that she was upset. \u201cHey, come on, Rachel, I was only teasing. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, unwilling to spend their precious time together arguing over how he viewed her best friend. These two days were going to be short enough.</p><p>\u201cListen, before I forget, I have a favor to ask you,\u201d Nate said, effectively changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d They exited off the freeway to Highway 16 and then over the TacomaNarrows. In another thirty minutes, they\u2019d be in Bremerton, where Nate was staying with a navy friend.</p><p>\u201cMy father called me about coming home for a big political rally in October. I want you to fly in and meet me there.\u201d Nate\u2019s father was a congressman from Pennsylvania. Nate had grown up accustomed to living in the spotlight; events such as campaign rallies, political dinners, meetings with diplomats and dignitaries were part of his everyday life.</p><p>Dread filled Rachel and although she tried, she couldn\u2019t keep the reluctance out of her voice. \u201cIf you want me there, then of course, I\u2019ll arrange to join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. This is important, Rachel. I\u2019d like you to meet my extended family and my friends.\u201d</p><p>The initial introduction to his parents, when they\u2019d visited the Seattle area a few months earlier, hadn\u2019t gone well. Nate evidently hadn\u2019t been aware of his mother\u2019s disapproval, although Rachel certainly hadn\u2019t missed it. While Patrice Olsen had seemed polite and charming, her message was clear. Rachel came without connections, without influential relatives or other beneficial associations. She was from a different class than the politically based Olsen clan, and Rachel was afraid she\u2019d never fit into his family. She was convinced Patrice had someone in mind for her only son. And that someone wasn\u2019t an orphaned hair and nail tech from Cedar Cove, Washington.</p><p>\u201cThe rally would be a great experience,\u201d Nate assured her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rachel knew she sounded doubtful, even though she tried not to.</p><p>\u201cI want you to understand the responsibilities of being part of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was straightforward enough. \u201cAre you thinking of running for office one day?\u201d she asked. When they\u2019d first met, Nate hadn\u2019t even told her his father was a congressman. He\u2019d joined the navy as an enlisted man in defiance of his family. At the time, he\u2019d felt the need to prove himself. Obviously that was no longer the case.</p><p>\u201cI have been thinking about it,\u201d Nate confessed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I will, but it\u2019s in the blood, you know? Just being at one of these rallies with Dad is exciting, and I didn\u2019t realize how much I missed it until he called. There\u2019s an energy to a campaign\u2014it\u2019s contagious. You\u2019ll see what I mean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Nate, I\u2019m not the right woman for you.\u201d She blurted this out, feeling close to tears. \u201cI hate being in the limelight. I\u2019d be a detriment to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel, how can you say that? I love you\u2014you\u2019re everything I want in a woman, a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not! How can I be? The mere thought of a political life terrifies me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so quick to judge. Meet me in October and you can see for yourself what it\u2019s really like. Don\u2019t be so willing to give up on us.\u201d</p><p>The possibility of not having Nate in her future was the deciding factor. \u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said, her voice resolute.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, babe.\u201d He reached for her hand, then raised it to his lips.</p><p>The weekend was a whirlwind of activity. Nate and Rachel arrived at the Puyallup Fairgrounds at eleven on Saturday morning and didn\u2019t leave until nearly ten that night. By then they\u2019d experienced just about everything the fair had to offer, from cotton candy to corn on the cob and rides that terrified her. They\u2019d attended a horse show and dog obedience trials and she\u2019d watched a baby chick peck its way out of its shell. At Rachel\u2019s strongly worded request, Nate purchased tickets to see one of the American Idol winners.</p><p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t tell any of my friends I actually paid to listen to someone from American Idol,\u201d Nate protested.</p><p>Rachel swatted his arm. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare say a bad word about my all-time favorite TV show.\u201d</p><p>Despite Nate\u2019s reservations, he seemed to enjoy the performance as much as Rachel did.</p><p>Sunday morning, after brunch at her place, they were on the ferry to the Seahawks game at Quest Field in downtown Seattle. The game was exciting, even for someone who didn\u2019t care much about football. The Seahawks won in the final seconds, and because the game was so close, Rachel and Nate left later than they\u2019d planned.</p> <p>She had to drop Nate off at the airport; there wasn\u2019t time to go inside with him. He kissed her long and hard, releasing her only when a security guard approached their vehicle.</p><p>\u201cMove along, folks,\u201d he said, waving toward Rachel\u2019s car.</p><p>Nate kissed her again. \u201cWe\u2019ll be together next month.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had put the political rally out of her mind. She sighed and closed her eyes, trying not to worry about it. Nate was right\u2014she shouldn\u2019t give up on their relationship without making more of an effort. She could learn to be the kind of wife he needed if he entered politics. She\u2019d just have to learn the social niceties. The protocol. The conversation.</p><p>She waited until he\u2019d walked through the glass doors, then drove away with tears in her eyes. Periodically on the drive back to Cedar Cove she had to blink rapidly to clear her vision.</p><p>Her small rental house felt even smaller once she got home. She tossed her purse and keys on a shelf in the hallway and ignored the blinking red light that informed her she had phone messages.</p><p>When the doorbell rang, she groaned audibly. She wasn\u2019t in any mood for company. She debated not answering but the doorbell rang again. Someone was persistent. Not entirely to her surprise, she found Bruce Peyton standing there\u2014looking as if he was lost and needed directions. Jolene wasn\u2019t with him, either.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d he\u2019d asked when she didn\u2019t immediately invite him inside.</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure, sorry.\u201d She\u2019d put him off when he\u2019d asked, earlier in the week, if they could get together, and felt guilty about that. \u201cI just got home,\u201d she explained. \u201cNot two minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said as he followed her into the kitchen. Without waiting to be asked, he slouched down in a kitchen chair.</p><p>She wondered what was wrong, and all at once it occurred to her that this might have to do with his daughter. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jolene?\u201d she asked urgently. \u201cShe\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s roller-skating with friends.\u201d He rested his elbows on the table, then propped up his head. He looked tired.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d She began to make a pot of coffee. Bruce could obviously use the caffeine and she needed something to do, something to work off her nervous tension.</p><p>Bruce studied her with wide blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re going to marry that navy guy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce, honestly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><p>The coffee had started to drain into the pot. Rachel waited until there was enough for a cup, then poured it into a mug, which she handed him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do yet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love him, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to marry you.\u201d He said this as though making a statement of fact.</p><p>Nodding, she filled a second mug. \u201cIf I do decide to marry Nate, we\u2019ll work something out with Jolene. She can fly out to visit us in California\u2014or wherever we are\u2014on a regular basis.\u201d Rachel sat across from him at the table.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d appreciate that, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d miss her. It isn\u2019t like I could just forget her.\u201d</p><p>He sipped his coffee, then held the mug with both hands and stared down at it. \u201cI care about you, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI care about you, too.\u201d</p><p>A smile came and went, almost before she could notice.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cA little while ago, I realized how much I depend on you. You\u2019re a good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider you a good friend, too.\u201d And she did.</p><p>\u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>At the game they\u2019d had hot dogs and soda, and then later Rachel had eaten salty, greasy popcorn. In fact, all she\u2019d had since brunch was junk food. \u201cNot really. Want to go out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The suggestion seemed to please him. \u201cDo you have anything in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Wok\u2019s?\u201d It was her favorite Chinese place.</p><p>\u201cFine with me.\u201d</p><p>Not until she was getting ready for bed later that night did she remember Bruce\u2019s comment that he knew she\u2019d just gotten home. He must have been parked outside her house, waiting.</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Christie Levitt wasn\u2019t sure what to make of Teri\u2019s sudden interest in reestablishing their relationship. As a kid she\u2019d looked up to Teri and followed her like a shadow. Not that it got her anywhere. Teri always lost patience with her little sister, dumping her whenever she could.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Christie was twelve or thirteen that she discovered she had something Teri didn\u2019t, and that was beauty. Not that Teri was ugly or anything. But Christie had the looks\u2014the classic face and shiny blond hair\u2014and the body to go with them. She\u2019d quickly learned to use that to her advantage, and then she\u2019d gone about proving she could have anything and everything her big sister did. The sense of power and exhilaration she got from stealing Teri\u2019s boyfriends was addictive. Christie wanted her sister to experience a little of the frustration she\u2019d felt when Teri used to exclude her. Rejection hurt. This was payback time\u2014and it went on and on. Christie had never been serious about any of the guys interested in her older sister. If she\u2019d felt remorse for her cruelty...well, she ignored it.</p><p>Her charm and beauty had never failed her until she met Teri\u2019s husband. Bobby Polgar had simply ignored her compliments. Nothing she\u2019d said had any effect on him. When Teri left the living room to check on dinner that first night, Christie had made her move. She\u2019d deliberately stood and walked over to Bobby, claiming she needed help with a button at the back of her blouse.</p><p>Bobby refused, claiming he wasn\u2019t good with buttons and she should ask Teri. It wasn\u2019t so much what he said as the way he said it. Bobby wasn\u2019t interested in her. He\u2019d fallen for Teri, and this seemed to be the one man who wasn\u2019t susceptible to Christie. He\u2019d shown it that first night and proved it several times since.</p><p>\u201cHome, miss?\u201d James asked, breaking into her thoughts.</p><p>Christie sat in the backseat of the stretch limo after an early dinner at Teri\u2019s. The car was utterly ridiculous, she told herself scornfully, and yet Bobby Polgar wasn\u2019t pretentious in the least. So why this fancy car and driver? The driver, especially, was annoying.</p><p>\u201cTake me to the Pink Poodle,\u201d she instructed. James had what could only be described as a stiff upper lip. Christie couldn\u2019t recall where she\u2019d heard that expression\u2014probably some BBC costume drama\u2014but it fit James perfectly. He was devoid of personality and so polite it made her crazy. She could tell him to jump off a bridge and his response would be something along the lines of \u201cVery good, miss.\u201d</p><p>Twice now\u2014since that disastrous dinner with their mother\u2014Teri had invited Christie to the house. On both occasions she\u2019d sent Bobby\u2019s driver to pick her up and afterward deliver her home.</p><p>Spending an evening with Teri and Bobby had become surprisingly enjoyable. They might not always agree but they were family\u2014and she hadn\u2019t thought of Teri that way in years. Family hadn\u2019t had much meaning for her until recently, although she\u2019d always been close to Johnny. So was Teri. They had that much in common, anyway. But until recently, Teri seemed to avoid her and, in all fairness, Christie knew why. She\u2019d made it a habit to be as unpleasant toward her older sister as possible. For the first time since childhood, Christie saw potential in their relationship. They were moving tentatively toward something new, a kind of friendship, and that required concessions from both of them.</p><p>Teri\u2019s marriage had started it. Christie had never seen her sister this happy, this much in love. Teri\u2019s husband was a bit...unusual, but Christie discovered she rather liked Bobby Polgar.</p><p>Teri seemed to want to make up for lost time now. She was reaching out to Christie in various unexpected ways. The long-stemmed red rose that had awaited her in the car both nights was a good example. It was a nice touch, thoughtful and rather sweet.</p><p>\u201cThe Pink Poodle, miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she snapped. The tone of his voice told her he disapproved. Well, he could think what he wanted. She didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Bobby was odd, but that was understandable. He was a famous chess player. As for Bobby\u2019s driver\u2014well, James had no excuse. He wasn\u2019t even English or anything. He just acted like someone on\u2014what was that old show? Upstairs, Downstairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Who the hell had a driver in this day and age, anyway? Then again, Bobby probably didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, which might explain why he\u2019d hired James. What didn\u2019t make sense was the way Bobby had James drive Teri everywhere she went. Talk about ridiculous. Still, if Bobby was going to keep the man as a full-time employee, James needed something to do. Driving Teri to the mall. Waiting around. Driving her back. Talk about boring.</p><p>Without further conversation, James pulled up in front of the local tavern where Christie spent several evenings a week. She tended to go there when she got off work at the Wal-Mart just outside Cedar Cove. It wasn\u2019t as though she had anyone waiting for her at home. The Pink Poodle was a friendly place; the music was lively and she could kick back and relax. James came around to the passenger door to let her out. He didn\u2019t look at her, which irritated her even more. The real reason she\u2019d asked him to bring her to the tavern was to get a reaction out of him. She should\u2019ve known she wouldn\u2019t. Other than the disapproving tone he\u2019d used earlier, he didn\u2019t give the slightest indication of...anything.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Ja-ames,\u201d she said, drawing out the one syllable of his name. The desire to break through that reserve of his was nearly overwhelming. She couldn\u2019t imagine what he\u2019d do if she suddenly kissed him. The thought produced a smile. He\u2019d keel over in a dead faint. Or step on the gas and drive right into a tree.</p><p>Climbing out of the car, Christie headed for the tavern door without a backward glance. Most people in the crowd greeted her; she knew nearly everyone there. Without stopping to chat, she went up to the bar and ordered a draft beer.</p> <p>Larry, the bartender, a middle-aged guy who was also the owner, picked up a chilled mug and automatically filled it from one of the taps. He didn\u2019t need to ask which brew she wanted. He knew what she liked.</p><p>She sat down on a stool and they chatted for a few minutes until Kyle Jamison strolled in the front door. \u201cSay, what\u2019s that limo doing outside?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Christie couldn\u2019t believe her ears. James was still parked outside!</p><p>Half the tavern moved over to stare out the smudged, wavy windows.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he waiting for?\u201d Larry asked, his nose practically pressed against the glass.</p> <p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Kyle commented as he slid onto the stool next to Christie. She\u2019d dated Kyle a couple of times. He was a local plumber and a decent guy. She liked him well enough but there weren\u2019t any sparks, and the relationship had gone nowhere. With most men, it was better just to be friends. She\u2019d crossed the line more than once with guys she knew from the tavern and always regretted it.</p><p>\u201cSay, can I get a beer over here?\u201d Kyle asked, growing impatient with Larry, who continued to gaze out the window.</p><p>\u201cComin\u2019 right up,\u201d Larry muttered.</p><p>Christie waited a respectable amount of time, then casually slid off the bar stool and walked toward the ladies\u2019 room. Instead of going down the hallway, though, she snuck out the door. Her footsteps resounded on the tarmac as she approached the limo, moving quickly. She wasn\u2019t halfway across the lot when James climbed out of the driver\u2019s seat and held open the passenger door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>He seemed surprised by the anger in her voice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting for you,\u201d he explained, as if that was completely logical.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to do that.\u201d</p><p>James shook his head. \u201cMiss Teri asked me to see you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she said, dismissing him with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Now he was really beginning to annoy her. \u201cI don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I move the car and wait for you around the corner?\u201d</p><p>Christie wanted to groan in frustration. \u201cNo. Just leave.\u201d</p> <p>He declined again with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cA friend will drive me home,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>James remained stubbornly quiet.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, miss.\u201d</p><p>Every word out of this man\u2019s mouth made her furious. \u201cAnd stop calling me Miss! My name is Christie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, Christie.\u201d</p><p>There was a silence, and they stared at each other, neither looking away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sit here even if I stay all night, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>From the firm set of his mouth, she could tell he wasn\u2019t kidding, either. He\u2019d sit in that damn car for hours without a word of complaint, patiently waiting for her to reappear.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d she groaned. \u201cYou win.\u201d She went back into the tavern, paid for her beer and left.</p><p>James remained standing by the passenger door, holding it for her. She climbed in and reached for the door handle, jerking it from his hand as she slammed it shut. She glanced out at the tavern, hoping no one had seen her get into the limo. She\u2019d never hear the end of it.</p><p>Slipping into the driver\u2019s seat, James started the engine and turned into the road.</p><p>\u201cNow look what I did,\u201d Christie complained. \u201cI ruined the rose my sister gave me.\u201d In her temper, she\u2019d sat on it and crushed the petals.</p><p>\u201cThat rose isn\u2019t from your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby gave me the rose?\u201d That didn\u2019t sound like something her brother-in-law would do.</p><p>\u201cNo, miss, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d She was so shocked she forgot to be upset that he\u2019d called her miss again.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth times?\u201d she asked speculatively.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Christie frowned. \u201cWhy?\u201d He didn\u2019t answer, so she rephrased her question. \u201cIs there a reason you bought me roses?\u201d She raised her voice so he\u2019d know she expected an answer.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to have them.\u201d</p><p>She regarded the crushed bud in her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t do it again, understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it, James.\u201d</p><p>There was no response. All at once Christie felt the most compelling urge to weep. That happened once in a while, usually when she\u2019d been drinking. This evening she hadn\u2019t even finished her beer, so that couldn\u2019t be it. Tears gathered in her eyes and she swallowed against the lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to tell Teri I don\u2019t want you driving me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what made her say that. James hadn\u2019t done anything to her and yet she seemed to be looking for ways to offend him.</p><p>When he drove up to her apartment building, she practically leaped out of the car. She certainly didn\u2019t give him time to get out and open her door. She ran to her apartment and hurriedly let herself inside. Her pulse roared in her ears as she leaned against the closed door, breathing hard. When she looked down she realized she still held the battered rose. A tear fell from her cheek and landed on the red petals.</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cWe got a postcard from Linnette,\u201d Corrie McAfee told Roy when he came into the office after his morning walk. Her voice was a little too cheerful, and he didn\u2019t believe it reflected how she really felt.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he asked. He\u2019d ultimately sided with his daughter about making her own decision, but that didn\u2019t mean he approved of the way she\u2019d taken off without a destination, without a plan. Nor did it mean he didn\u2019t sympathize with her reasons. Like any father, he hated seeing his child hurt.</p><p>\u201cNorth Dakota,\u201d Corrie told him, studying the postcard. \u201cA town called BuffaloValley. Roy,\u201d she said, glaring at him. \u201cShe\u2019s taken a job as a waitress at a restaurant called 3 of a Kind. She says the owner won the business in a card game about ten years ago. What sort of place is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently one that needs a waitress,\u201d he said in as casual a tone as he could manage.</p><p>\u201cAfter all those years of schooling and medical training, Linnette is working as a waitress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He didn\u2019t like the sound of that, either. However, he was willing to give Linnette the benefit of the doubt and wait a few months until she found her footing.</p><p>\u201cA waitress,\u201d his wife repeated indignantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat I find interesting,\u201d he said, \u201cis that she chose to mail us a postcard rather than call.\u201d</p><p>He and Corrie exchanged a quick, private smile.</p><p>Their daughter Gloria had once mailed them postcards, too, but hers had been anonymous with cryptic messages neither of them had understood at the time.</p><p>Corrie handed him Linnette\u2019s postcard and he read through the tightly scribbled lines. \u201cShe seems fairly happy,\u201d he said, somewhat surprised. \u201cApparently the proprietor\u2019s included a room with the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffalo Bob? I don\u2019t like it, Roy. What a ridiculous name!\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Corrie, we raised our daughter to the best of our ability. Linnette\u2019s got a good head on her shoulders. She\u2019s told us about this job and where she\u2019s living, so the least we can do is trust her judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d Corrie cried. \u201cHer judgment ever since Cal broke up with her has been terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn our opinion,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOur opinion?\u201d she returned, her eyes narrowing. \u201cYou mean to say you thought so, too, and didn\u2019t say anything?\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019d certainly stepped into that one. Roy nodded slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the fact that Linnette chose to run away, but she felt she had to make a change, which I understand. We won\u2019t always agree with her decisions, Corrie.\u201d He put his arm around his wife\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThat\u2019s a given. We didn\u2019t always approve of Mack\u2019s choices, either. Kids have to learn to fend for themselves. We can\u2019t get in the habit of rescuing them every time.\u201d</p><p>Roy could tell that his wife still had trouble with this, and he didn\u2019t blame her. Corrie was a nurturer, someone who tried to fix whatever was wrong, especially in her children\u2019s lives. He tended to feel that kids should face the consequences of their actions. Not just kids\u2014everyone. Which wasn\u2019t to say he didn\u2019t miss Linnette; he did. He wanted her back home. He believed that eventually she would return, but not until she was ready. Not until she\u2019d figured out whatever she needed to know.</p><p>Later that same afternoon, he went to the sheriff\u2019s office and saw Troy Davis sitting at his desk, the phone held to his ear. The sheriff noticed Roy and immediately gestured him inside. There was a coffeepot across the hall; Roy helped himself to a mug while Troy finished up his conversation.</p><p>When Roy came back into the office, the sheriff was off the phone. He picked up his own mug and ambled across the hall for a refill. Roy noticed a haggard, weary look on his face.</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Troy didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cRemember Martha Evans who died a couple months back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe widow? Didn\u2019t Pastor Flemming find the body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s her. The family claims that several expensive pieces of her jewelry are missing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roy was taken aback. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Dave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Troy shook his head. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t come here to listen to my woes. What brings you to my neck of the woods?\u201d</p><p>Roy decided not to pursue the subject of the missing jewelry. \u201cI\u2019m doing legwork on a case. Gotta check some old police reports. Corrie asked me to stop in and invite you to dinner Friday night.\u201d</p><p>Troy\u2019s gaze instantly left his. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m busy Friday. I\u2019ve got another engagement. Thank Corrie for me, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Would Saturday be better?\u201d</p><p>Troy still didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI\u2019m busy Saturday too.\u201d</p><p>Roy found this astonishing. \u201cYou seem to have an active social calendar all of a sudden.\u201d Not that it was any of his business, but Troy always used to be eager for a dinner invitation, especially after he\u2019d moved Sandy to the nursing facility. Roy couldn\u2019t remember the sheriff ever turning him down, especially for a meal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...\u201d Troy seemed more than a little flustered. \u201cI\u2019ve reconnected with an old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMale or female?\u201d Judging by Troy\u2019s discomfort, he guessed it was a woman, but he couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p> <p>\u201cFemale,\u201d Troy muttered, lifting the coffee mug to his lips so that his answer was muffled.</p><p>Roy peered across the desk at him. \u201cAre your ears getting red or am I imagining things?\u201d</p><p>Troy scowled back. \u201cYou\u2019re imagining things.\u201d</p><p>Roy had to make an effort to suppress his smile. He, too, took a sip of coffee to hide his amusement. \u201cThis so-called friend got a name?\u201d he asked next.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a long tricky name.\u201d</p> <p>Troy snickered. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that her surname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Troy sighed. \u201cEnough of this nonsense. If you must know, her name is Faith.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded in an encouraging manner. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told Megan about her yet, so I\u2019d appreciate if you didn\u2019t mention any of this to my daughter.\u201d</p><p>This was even more surprising than the news that Troy was seeing another woman so soon after Sandy\u2019s death. When he\u2019d asked Roy to be one of the pallbearers, the sheriff was badly shaken by the loss of his wife, despite her long illness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing Faith on Friday, then having dinner with Megan and Craig on Saturday,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>\u201cI heard about Megan\u2019s miscarriage,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Troy settled both hands around his mug. \u201cSandy lost two pregnancies, and both times she fell into depression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Megan doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot well, I\u2019m afraid. She put a lot of significance in the fact that she probably conceived the baby either right before Sandy\u2019s death or right after.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded thoughtfully. Without meaning to, the poor girl was probably making a painful situation even harder on herself.</p><p>\u201cTwo big losses like that, one right after the other\u2014it\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d Troy continued. \u201cWhich is why I haven\u2019t told her about Faith.\u201d</p><p>Roy leaned back in his chair. \u201cShe isn\u2019t going to hear about it from me, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Troy murmured.</p><p>The sheriff\u2019s phone rang and Roy stood to go. As he left, he heard the other man\u2019s voice take on a gentle, soothing quality. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey,\u201d he was saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll just...\u201d</p><p>Roy moved down the hall, out of earshot. The sheriff was talking to his daughter.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>Grace and Cliff\u2019s wedding reception would be Saturday, October 13, which still gave them three weeks to finish getting everything organized. That weekend, thank goodness, worked for almost everyone; their families and close friends would all be available. Grace was particularly excited about seeing Cliff\u2019s daughter, Lisa, and her family, who were flying in from the east coast.</p><p>Sitting at the kitchen table on Saturday morning, she went over her extensive to-do list. Decorations, catering, her outfit and hair appointment, wedding cake...A lot of details to keep track of. All the work, all the time spent organizing and making phone calls, would be worth it, though. This would be a celebration of Cliff\u2019s and her commitment, their love.</p><p>Cliff had gone into Cedar Cove to do some errands, and the house was quiet. She glanced around; everything was orderly and comfortable. Recently Grace had begun to make a few changes. Nothing drastic, though. Cliff had lived here on his own for twelve years, and the place had a distinctively masculine feel, so she\u2019d added a few feminine flourishes, beginning with decorative pillows on the bed. This was followed by a row of family photographs, hers and his, on the dresser. Cliff immediately approved of the pictures, but the pillows were there for two weeks before he even noticed.</p><p>\u201cWhere did those come from?\u201d he\u2019d asked one night as they got ready for bed.</p><p>\u201cI put them there,\u201d she told him. \u201cThey look attractive, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought about it for a moment and agreed, then once again assured Grace she could change whatever she wanted in the house. Still, she was trying not to overwhelm him with too many alterations and additions at once. Slowly, she went about making a few changes. A couple of oil paintings, both western landscapes she\u2019d bought at the gallery years before, had gone up next. When she pointed them out, Cliff had nodded, obviously pleased with her choices.</p><p>Jon and Maryellen had given them a print of one of Jon\u2019s best-selling photographs as a wedding gift. It showed snow-covered Mt.Rainier against the backdrop of Puget Sound with a pink-and-lavender sunset. With Cliff\u2019s help, she\u2019d hung that over the fireplace. He\u2019d admired it, too, full of praise for her son-in-law\u2019s talent.</p><p>She\u2019d just started checking the RSVPs against the list of invited guests when the back door opened and Cliff walked in.</p><p>\u201cHello, sweetheart. Would you like some lunch?\u201d she asked, getting up from the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Without looking at her, he walked directly to the cupboard for a mug and poured himself a cup of coffee.</p><p>It was past one, and Grace had postponed her own lunch, waiting for him, assuming they\u2019d eat together. \u201cDid you have lunch in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He kept his back to her.</p><p>Grace set her pen aside. All the warm feelings she\u2019d experienced a few minutes earlier left her. \u201cAre you ignoring me?\u201d she half joked, wondering at his mood.</p><p>Finally he turned to face her. His eyes held none of the tenderness she was accustomed to seeing, and her stomach tensed. She knew what had happened.</p><p>\u201cHow long has Will Jefferson been in town?\u201d her husband asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d This was true, in a fashion. She was certainly aware that Will had returned to Cedar Cove, but not exactly when he\u2019d arrived. \u201cDid you see him?\u201d she asked, striving to sound nonchalant.</p><p>\u201cOh, I saw him. He saw me, too.\u201d</p><p>Grace closed her eyes for a second, filled with regret and remorse. She wished she\u2019d told him when she\u2019d first heard about it. Now she was terrified that Will would do whatever he could to drive a wedge between her and Cliff.</p><p>\u201cYou knew he was in town?\u201d Cliff demanded.</p><p>Grace swallowed. \u201cOlivia told me....\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here to stay?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded reluctantly. She hadn\u2019t really meant to hide it from Cliff. But it\u2019d become more difficult to tell him the longer she delayed. Considering his reaction now, she\u2019d give anything to have told him the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think it was important to mention this?\u201d he asked. His voice was calm, but Grace could feel the emotion behind his question. He felt hurt, angry, betrayed.</p><p>At this point Grace feared that anything she said would only upset him further. \u201cI probably should have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she agreed contritely, \u201cI should have mentioned it\u2014as soon as I found out. But, Cliff, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond or even let her finish her remark. Holding the mug, he walked out of the kitchen. Shocked by his unaccustomed rudeness, Grace followed him to the door and watched as he crossed the yard and entered the barn. Her first inclination was to go after him. She pushed open the screen door, then hesitated. Cliff needed a few minutes alone, she thought, and so did she.</p><p>The problem, of course, was Cliff\u2019s marriage to Susan. His ex-wife had had a series of affairs, so trust was difficult for Cliff. Grace knew he wanted to believe in her fidelity but struggled with his experiences from the past.</p><p>She realized then that she couldn\u2019t let another second pass without setting things straight. There\u2019d been rain the night before, but heedless of her shoes, she started across the yard just as Cliff walked out of the barn, leading his stallion Midnight. The horse was saddled, and Cliff obviously intended to go riding.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he said curtly as he swung into the saddle.</p><p>\u201cCliff,\u201d she said, gazing up at him. \u201cPlease. This is important.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her. \u201cI\u2019ll feel better after I clear my head. We can talk then.\u201d</p><p>With a sick feeling in her stomach, she went back to the house. Sitting at the kitchen table again, she studied the guest list for the reception but couldn\u2019t concentrate.</p><p>She paced the house, transferred laundry from the washing machine to the dryer, then decided to bake an apple pie. She hoped that by showing him how much she loved him, he\u2019d know he had nothing to fear.</p><p>Two hours passed before he came back.</p><p>When he kicked off his muddy boots by the kitchen door, the pie was cooling on the counter. He glanced at it and, to her surprise, seemed more perturbed than ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like?\u201d she asked in a teasing voice. \u201cI baked you an apple pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He maintained the distance between them.</p><p>Grace stood with her back to the counter. \u201cI\u2014I wanted you to see how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff, you\u2019re overreacting! This is ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cDid I ever tell you Susan used to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever I learned about her current affair, she\u2019d bake me a pie or make dinner, which was a rarity. That was her way of telling me she was sorry. She\u2019d promise me it was the last time, swear up and down that I was the one she really loved.\u201d</p><p>Furious that Cliff had compared her to his first wife, Grace strode over to the counter, picked up the pie and without a word, dumped it in the garbage. \u201cI was married to Dan for more than thirty years. Not once in all those years did I even consider being unfaithful. Not once. How dare you compare me to Susan. How dare you.\u201d She choked back tears, glaring at him across the room.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me about Will Jefferson,\u201d he said accusingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s such a big sin?

This problem was too important to be deferred; if they didn\u2019t settle it now, it would loom between them, growing more awkward all the time.</p><p>\u201cI have a party interested in renting your house on Rosewood Lane</p><p>. They\u2019ve given me a check for the first month\u2019s rent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just not sure about them....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Grace didn\u2019t want to go another month making payments on a house that sat empty. She\u2019d been forced to refinance in order to cover a debt of her dead husband\u2019s. Before committing suicide, Dan had borrowed money from his cousin, which Grace felt honor-bound to repay.</p> <p>\u201cThe Smiths\u2019 references are questionable and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudy, this really isn\u2019t a good time. Can we discuss it later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey gave you a check, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen rent the house,\u201d she said, decision made.</p><p>\u201cGrace, are you absolutely certain about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said rashly, intent on resuming her conversation with Cliff.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll tell the Smiths they can have the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Grace prepared to hang up the phone. \u201cBye\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to come by and sign some paperwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, Judy. Goodbye now.\u201d Before the other woman could make small talk, Grace concluded the call and put back the receiver. Turning to Cliff, she braced herself.</p><p>Cliff now stood on the other side of the kitchen. \u201cYou said you hadn\u2019t spoken to Will, then you said he\u2019d been in the library. So you saw him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and we did speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re changing your story. Again.\u201d</p><p>Grace felt like groaning with frustration. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about it, and then I remembered. I wanted you to know the whole truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d Cliff crossed his arms. His body language couldn\u2019t have been more obvious; he was protecting himself, warding off pain\u2014or the threat of pain.</p><p>\u201cExactly what I told you,\u201d she told him, raising her voice. \u201cWill invited me to lunch. He said it was so we could clear the air. I declined. I want nothing more to do with Will Jefferson and he knows it. Despite that, he\u2019s trying to create doubt and confusion between us and you\u2019re letting him. I, for one, am not going to allow it. I married you. I love you and I want to be your wife until the day I die.\u201d</p><p>Cliff faltered slightly. After a few seconds, he dropped his arms and sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t have lunch. I think I might be a bit cranky.\u201d</p><p>She felt the tension seep away. Studying him, she said, \u201cYou should know I\u2019ve decided against ever cooking again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d Frowning, he eyed the chicken breasts thawing on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cIf Susan cooked for you out of guilt, then I refuse to follow in her footsteps. As a result, I may very well have baked my last pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Cliff\u2019s protest was immediate.</p><p>\u201cCompare me to Susan again and watch what happens.\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, for the first time that afternoon, and opened his arms to her. \u201cI\u2019m a jealous idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d she agreed, walking into his embrace. Their argument had frightened her, but the fact that Will held such power over her marriage was even worse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Cliff whispered.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d She clung to him, still shaken by what had almost happened. \u201cI\u2019m not Susan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I hate myself for implying otherwise. But please, Grace, don\u2019t keep anything from me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, I promise.\u201d She closed her eyes, listening to the beat of his heart, and for a moment all they did was stand there, in the middle of the kitchen, holding each other.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that apple pie is ruined?\u201d</p><p>She saw him look longingly at the garbage. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d</p><p>Cliff\u2019s chest expanded with a sigh of regret. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cHowever, I made two apple pies and put the second one in the freezer. I\u2019ll heat it up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He leaned down and kissed her, hands clasped at her back. \u201cOne more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She spread small kisses along his neck, taking pleasure in the intimacy they shared.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said about not cooking anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow serious were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...for a suitable incentive I could be persuaded to reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Cliff stroked her back slowly and with just the right pressure. \u201cDo you have any suggestions on how I can make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019d be more than happy to do that,\u201d she said, standing on the tips of her toes and offering him her mouth. The lengthy kiss that followed was not only satisfying, it promised much, much more.</p><p>Suitable incentive, indeed.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>Linnette McAfee had been in Buffalo Valley, North Dakota, for almost two weeks. Her meager savings had run out much faster than she\u2019d expected; gas, food and motels had taken a lot of it, and she didn\u2019t want to use her credit cards until she had money coming in.</p><p>She\u2019d stayed off the main thoroughfares and stumbled onto this town by accident. Since it was almost lunchtime, she\u2019d walked into the only decent-size restaurant around, a place called 3 of a Kind. Standing outside, she\u2019d noticed a sign in the window advertising for a waitress. She was down to a couple of hundred dollars, so she decided to apply.</p><p>\u201cYou ever worked as a waitress?\u201d asked a burly man with a leather vest and a long skinny ponytail. He had tattoos on both arms, and in other circumstances might have intimidated her. He\u2019d introduced himself as Buffalo Bob and although he looked as if he belonged in a biker gang, his eyes were kind. Before she could answer, two small children came rushing in, calling him Daddy. Buffalo Bob scooped them up in his arms, which was enough to convince Linnette that she had nothing to fear from him. Later, she\u2019d met his wife, Merrily, and discovered there was a third child, an infant who kept the young mother so busy she could no longer work in the restaurant.</p><p>Linnette had some experience waiting tables. Years ago, while she was still in high school, she\u2019d worked in a neighborhood diner.</p><p>\u201cDo you have references?\u201d Buffalo Bob had asked once the kids had gone upstairs and they were able to resume the interview.</p><p>\u201cNo. And I don\u2019t have a place to live, either.\u201d She might as well lay her cards on the table. The name of the establishment certainly encouraged that, she\u2019d thought with a smile.</p><p>He\u2019d smiled back, but then tried to sound stern. \u201cThe job comes with a hotel room. It isn\u2019t the Ritz so don\u2019t get your hopes up, but it\u2019s clean and has a television. We live here ourselves.\u201d He eyed her speculatively. \u201cYou running from the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d She\u2019d been shocked that he\u2019d even asked such a question.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not looking for trouble here,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bringing any with me,\u201d she informed him primly.</p><p>Whatever his doubts, Buffalo Bob had offered her the job and Linnette had settled into this small town, which in many respects was like the one she\u2019d left\u2014with a couple of exceptions. It was smaller, and Cal Washburn didn\u2019t live there.</p><p>This was Linnette\u2019s first day off after working ten days straight and she planned to explore the area. She\u2019d already met a few people. Hassie Knight, who had to be at least eighty, owned the pharmacy and seemed to be the person everyone went to for guidance or advice. It reminded her of the way people in Cedar Cove confided in Charlotte Rhodes. Maddy McKenna ran the grocery; she lived somewhere outside town with her husband and two children, a girl and a little boy. Linnette had enjoyed meeting all four of them the previous Sunday and taken an instant liking to Maddy. When her newfound friend asked her to visit the ranch, the two kids seemed eager to show Linnette around, especially once they learned she\u2019d never seen a real buffalo. \u201cBison,\u201d they corrected her in unison.</p><p>Maddy\u2019s husband, Jeb, was quiet, smiling readily at his wife and family, although Maddy carried most of the conversation. Linnette saw that Jeb walked with a limp, but he didn\u2019t seem self-conscious about it. He seconded Maddy\u2019s invitation to come out to the ranch.</p><p>The sky was overcast as Linnette got into her car. She and Maddy had met for coffee a few days earlier, and Maddy had given her written directions to their ranch. Linnette could hardly wait to tell Gloria about these instructions, which would definitely amuse her sister. As a cop, Gloria had heard plenty of convoluted and downright incomprehensible directions from members of the public.</p><p>According to Maddy\u2019s notes, Linnette was to drive 2.3 miles south of town, turn left at the dying oak, then follow the road until the dip and the rural route box with the black lettering. From there, she was to...Linnette flipped over the page.</p><p>The color of the sky reminded her of the flat gray of the navy vessels that congregated in the Cove. In the state of Washington, that usually presaged rain. She was sure it meant the same thing here. Just her luck, too\u2014her first day off.</p><p>The sky was growing perceptibly gloomier. And it was hot. The heat seemed oppressive for September, unlike home, but what surprised Linnette most was how still everything was. Even with her windows down, she couldn\u2019t hear any birds. The road was completely deserted.</p><p>Then she saw it.</p><p>A mass of black, twisting, spiraling cloud in the distance. She recognized the characteristic funnel shape of a tornado. A tornado? Here? Now? This couldn\u2019t be happening!</p><p>The next thought that flashed through her mind was: What should I do? Her medical training kept her level-headed and calm as she analyzed the danger. Although the panic was quickly rising in her chest, she refused to give in. Keep calm, she told herself. Keep calm.</p><p>Her hands sweating, she gripped the steering wheel and pulled to a stop along the side of the road. Staying with the vehicle seemed to offer the best protection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she stared out the windshield, she saw that the twister was coming straight at her. If she couldn\u2019t outrun it, she\u2019d be killed. The image of Sheriff Davis arriving at her parents\u2019 door, informing them of her death, was unbearable. Her mother had insisted Linnette was making the wrong decision. This would be the ultimate confirmation.</p><p>Barely aware of what she was doing, Linnette scrambled out of her car. Was she going to die? It looked that way, she observed in some remote part of her brain. She\u2019d never survive this. Already the wind was strong enough to throw her to the ground, carry her away, hurl her into the next field\u2014or the next county. The only reason she was still upright was that she held on to the open car door. Her hair whipped painfully about her face.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, another vehicle crested the hill, roaring down the road toward her. This truck was obviously trying to outrun the tornado. It came to a screeching halt beside her.</p><p>\u201cGet in!\u201d the man yelled and flung open the passenger door.</p> <p>Linnette leaped into the vehicle. Half in and half out of the truck, she clutched the dashboard as he took off again. she\u2019d just managed to clamber all the way in when the man slammed on his brakes again and the passenger door banged shut.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d he yelled.</p><p>Hardly able to open the truck door against the force of the wind, Linnette threw the full weight of her body against it until the door flew open. The man, already out, grabbed her around the waist and dragged her into a large culvert beside the road.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to die,\u201d Linnette told him, astonished by how calm she sounded. That serenity quickly evaporated when the wind hit. Crouched down though they were, the violence of it dashed them both to the ground. The noise was like a jet engine roaring through a tunnel.</p><p>Linnette screamed in sheer terror. The man, this stranger, clasped her by the waist and held her against him, his arms around her, protecting her. The roaring of the wind was horrendous. Painful.</p> <p>Then, without warning, it was gone.</p><p>Linnette\u2019s ears hurt, and she wasn\u2019t sure if that was because of the terrible sound or the change in barometric pressure.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re not dead,\u201d the man said to her.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked up at him and into the bluest eyes she\u2019d seen other than Cal\u2019s. The sudden memory brought a rush of tears.</p><p>\u201cHey, everything\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop the tears, though.</p> <p>He broke away from her and reached in his back pocket for a clean white handkerchief. She\u2019d never met anyone who carried a handkerchief before.</p><p>His thoughtfulness only induced more tears. Not ladylike sniffles, either, but wrenching sobs that made her shoulders shake. To add to her embarrassment, she started hiccuping, too, as she and her rescuer sat in the culvert side by side, their knees bent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Pete Mason,\u201d he said. \u201cMy brother and I own a wheat ranch about ten miles down the road. I was going into town for supplies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette McAfee,\u201d she said between sobs.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She took a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cI was in love, you know, really, truly in love, and then Cal dumped me. He went away to...to rescue mustangs and fell for the vet. The thing is, they\u2019re perfect together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Clearly he didn\u2019t. \u201cAnd...and my brother has all kinds of money he\u2019s never told anyone about.\u201d</p> <p>Pete stared at her. Linnette had no idea why she couldn\u2019t stop talking; despite her best efforts, the words continued to spill out. \u201cI left Cedar Cove\u2014my hometown. I basically just packed my bags and drove off. People thought I was an idiot and...and maybe I am. Even my mother, my own mother, said I was making a terrible mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I knew all about love and I don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>In an obvious attempt to comfort her, Pete laid his arm across her shoulders.</p><p>Wiping her nose with his handkerchief, Linnette took a wobbly breath. \u201cI have no idea why I\u2019m telling you the most intimate details of my life. I\u2019ve worked for Buffalo Bob and Merrily for almost two weeks and haven\u2019t told them any of this.\u201d</p><p>Maybe she was having some sort of emotional breakdown. Maybe the tornado and her extreme fear had pushed her over the edge of sanity. How else could she explain what had come over her? She\u2019d never reacted like this to anyone before. Here she was, divulging her private life to a complete stranger.</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay if I leave you here for a minute?\u201d Pete asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t true, and when he half stood and started to leave the culvert, she got to her feet and followed him. Walking low to the ground, they cleared the culvert.</p><p>As soon as they reached the road, Linnette gasped. It looked as if someone had burned a trail through the land, displacing the earth and everything around it. Then she realized her car was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cMy car!\u201d she cried in shock. Had she stayed with it as she\u2019d originally intended, she would\u2019ve been hurled into the air....</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou saved my life! If you hadn\u2019t come along when you did, I\u2019d be dead now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother two minutes and we both would\u2019ve been goners.\u201d</p><p>Pete\u2019s truck was tipped on its side about two hundred feet down the road.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d she asked helplessly.</p><p>\u201cEither we walk back to town or we wait for someone to drive by,\u201d Pete told her. \u201cI say we wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She really didn\u2019t know what else she could do, anyway. And he was the one who was familiar with these roads, this land.</p><p>They sat down on a patch of flattened grass. Now that the adrenaline had subsided, she felt weak, exhausted. Looking at her rescuer, Linnette saw that Pete was well over six feet. Tall enough so she had to tilt her head back. He was lean, too. He\u2019d been wearing a cowboy hat when she first saw him, but that had long since blown away.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d typically describe as handsome. Yet there was something compelling about his appearance, especially his brilliant blue eyes.</p><p>His cheekbones were strongly defined, and his nose looked as if it\u2019d been broken once. The dimple in his chin drew her attention, too. All in all, she had to admit she found him attractive.</p><p>At least an hour passed before someone drove through. As they sat there, chatting in a desultory manner, she began to feel more and more uncomfortable in Pete\u2019s company. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t remind her of the way she\u2019d blurted out all the embarrassing elements of her life\u2014like the fact that Cal had dumped her after falling in love with Vicki. Still, it hung between them.</p><p>The rancher who drove them into town dropped Linnette off at 3 of a Kind. By then she had trouble even meeting Pete\u2019s eyes. Most humiliating was her realization that, while she couldn\u2019t stop babbling, Pete hadn\u2019t shared a single detail of his own life. The sum total she\u2019d learned was that he lived on his family\u2019s ranch. For all she knew, he could be married with a houseful of children. Not that she was looking for a romance. She was running away from one and had no plans to involve herself in another.</p><p>\u201cThank you again,\u201d she said over her shoulder. She waved at the rancher and at Pete, who\u2019d lowered the passenger window of the pickup.</p><p>\u201cLike I told you, Dennis Urlacher can tow your car back to town,\u201d he called out to her. \u201cHe\u2019ll give you a fair estimate on repairs, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks, I appreciate that.\u201d Red-faced, she hurried into the restaurant. At this point, her car was the least of her concerns. They might never even find it. The damn thing could be in the next county by now or at the bottom of some lake. Linnette was just grateful she wasn\u2019t inside it.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Buffalo Bob asked from the tavern side of the restaurant. \u201cMerrily was worried when she remembered you were driving to the McKenna place today. We heard there was a tornado warning out there. You see anything?\u201d</p><p>Rather than launch into a long explanation, Linnette simply nodded. Doing her best to look composed, she walked past the men sitting at the bar and made her way to the stairs that led to the second floor. Dashing up the steps, she ran down the long hallway to the very rear of the building, where her room was situated.</p><p>She threw herself on the bed, breathing hard, torn between relief at surviving and humiliation at her own disclosures.</p><p>Thirty years from now, her experience in the tornado would be a wonderful story to relate to her grandchildren\u2014if she had any. Naturally, Linnette would embellish it a bit, add some humor. At the moment, however, she could see nothing amusing in the circumstances. Nothing whatsoever.</p><p>A few days went by, and the traumatic events of that morning were relegated to the back of her mind. She refused to linger on them. Every time she thought about the tornado and everything that followed, her face heated up as if she had a bad case of sunburn.</p><p>Her parents had phoned, of course, after seeing images of the destruction on the TV news, and so had Maddy. She\u2019d briefly described what had happened\u2014without mentioning Pete. Everyone praised her clearheadedness and quick action, which made her cringe with guilt. Fortunately, she hadn\u2019t seen Pete since that fateful day.</p><p>Then on Sunday afternoon, while she was waiting tables by herself, he sauntered into 3 of a Kind. He saw her and inclined his head in recognition. Choosing a corner table, he pulled out a chair and placed his Stetson\u2014obviously a new one\u2014on the empty seat beside him.</p><p>With no other alternative, Linnette brought him a menu and a glass of ice water.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you again,\u201d Pete said, smiling up at her.</p><p>Not trusting herself to speak, Linnette bit her tongue and nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out about your car?\u201d he asked as he opened his menu.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a write-off,\u201d she told him. There was major structural damage. One side was crushed when the car landed against a tree a few fields from where she\u2019d stopped. Most of the glass was shattered and the damage to the frame was extensive. Although Linnette complained every month when she wrote out a hefty car insurance payment, she was grateful for it now. According to the adjuster, she had the go-ahead to order a new car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d Pete said, glancing away from his menu. He chose the meat loaf and mashed potato special.</p><p>\u201cWhat about...your truck?\u201d It seemed only polite to ask.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cA few dents. I figure they add character.\u201d</p><p>She liked his attitude.</p><p>\u201cJust like a broken heart adds character to a person...\u201d</p><p>Glaring at him, Linnette jerked the menu out of his hands and stomped off to place his order. How dare he say that to her! Pete might have saved her life, but that didn\u2019t give him permission to embarrass her.</p><p>She\u2019d never talk to him again, Linnette decided. Ever.</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>Jack had three steaks ready for the grill when Olivia got home from the courthouse Thursday afternoon. They rarely ate red meat anymore; however, they\u2019d invited Will to dinner, and she knew her brother\u2019s favorite was T-bone steak. Besides, she had a few questions for Will and she wanted him in a good mood when she asked them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No doubt Jack was pleased with the menu. Olivia kept a careful eye on her husband\u2019s diet. After his heart attack, Jack had promised to abstain from fast food and late hours. He left the newspaper office as close to five as he could these days and often got home before she did, which was a real switch from the way things used to be.</p><p>\u201cHi, Jack,\u201d she greeted him, setting her purse on a small table in the hallway alcove, just as she did every night.</p><p>\u201cOut here,\u201d Jack called. He had a Reba CD playing and the volume was loud enough to rattle the windows. She was surprised he\u2019d heard her at all.</p><p>Moving into the kitchen, Olivia found her husband preparing a salad. He\u2019d arranged pale green Boston lettuce and baby spinach leaves in a large glass bowl, which sat on the kitchen counter, along with two ripe tomatoes and a cucumber fresh from her garden.</p> <p>\u201cDo your talents never cease?\u201d she teased, sliding her arms around his middle. She hadn\u2019t realized how deeply she loved this man\u2014who\u2019d come into her life nearly twenty years after her divorce\u2014until he\u2019d almost died. Now she appreciated every day she had with him. Every minute.</p><p>\u201cI picked up a bottle of a new spray-on salad dressing,\u201d he was saying. \u201cThere was a coupon in the Chronicle and I used it. I think we\u2019ll like this one.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the bottle of Italian dressing and she glanced at the label with an appropriately enthusiastic comment. Who would\u2019ve dreamed that Jack Griffin, editor of the Cedar Cove Chronicle and renowned junk-food fanatic, would care about low-fat salad dressing? Certainly not Olivia.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spoiling me,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, I was thinking I\u2019d get you happy and then lure you into my den of iniquity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDen of iniquity? Den of books and stacks of paper is more like it.\u201d Olivia loved the banter between them. \u201cAnyway, after all this time you should know you don\u2019t need gifts of salad dressing to get me into your arms.\u201d</p><p>Jack turned and enfolded her in his embrace, kissing the tip of her nose. \u201cThe things you say to me, woman, it\u2019s a wonder I don\u2019t seduce you right here on the kitchen floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let my brother find us?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jack scowled. \u201cOh, yeah. I forgot for a minute\u2014Will\u2019s coming to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, I need to talk to him....\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want me to conveniently disappear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind?\u201d She sighed unhappily. \u201cIt\u2019s just that this might get awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to retreat to my den,\u201d he said, waggling his eyebrows in Groucho Marx fashion.</p><p>After a quick kiss, Olivia went into the bedroom to change while Jack finished making the salad. When she returned he\u2019d poured two glasses of iced tea.</p><p>As they waited for Will, they sat on the front porch, which overlooked the Cove. The waters were a clear blue and, for September, surprisingly calm. Sitting side by side on the glider, they sipped their tea and enjoyed the quiet of early evening.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Olivia asked, grateful for these few minutes alone. Will\u2019s arrival would transform this peaceful mood into one of tension.</p><p>\u201cI had lunch with Seth,\u201d Jack said. \u201cRan into him at the deli. I had vegetable soup and a multigrain bagel with low-fat cream cheese,\u201d he added righteously.</p><p>\u201cWell, I had lunch with Justine.\u201d She smiled. Her daughter had been full of news about the sale of the waterfront land and their purchase of a commercial plot off Harbor Street</p><p>. Everything had come together so smoothly, Justine was convinced this was meant to be. She\u2019d talked about collecting Charlotte\u2019s special recipes. Justine planned to use them in the tearoom, which had pleased Charlotte no end. In fact, during their last conversation, Olivia had learned that her mother was finally writing down all her recipes. Although friends and family had been asking for ages, Justine had given her the inspiration she needed.</p> <p>\u201cSeth told me the permits have been issued and construction on the tearoom should start in the next few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine said the same thing.\u201d</p><p>They both paused to savor their tea. Olivia loved the serenity of early autumn. Summer had lingered in the Pacific Northwest, but soon the rains would come. The days would grow short and the bleakness of winter would begin to descend. At the end of the month, Jack would store the barbecue in the garage for the winter and put away the patio furniture. Hard to believe on a lovely night like this. Knowing how few such evenings remained made it even more special.</p><p>\u201cSeth said he\u2019d decided to keep his job with the boat broker,\u201d Jack told her.</p><p>Olivia already knew this, and felt it was a wise decision. She said as much.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Jack questioned. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing so well, and...\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it would do any harm to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d He paused, frowning and obviously puzzled. \u201cSeth didn\u2019t say anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know yet. Justine is telling him tonight.\u201d Justine\u2019s pregnancy was wonderful news to Olivia. Not so long ago, she\u2019d begun to lose hope of ever having grandchildren and now, like Grace, she\u2019d have four. Her youngest son, James, who was in the navy and lived in San Diego, had two children and soon Justine would, as well.</p><p>After a few minutes, Jack kissed the side of her face. \u201cYou\u2019re very quiet all of a sudden. Any particular reason?\u201d</p><p>Olivia finished her tea. \u201cI was thinking about Jordan,\u201d she said. The son who\u2019d died the summer he was thirteen. More than twenty years had passed since his death, and hardly a day went by that she didn\u2019t think about him. Her thoughts were especially poignant at times like this, when she learned she was about to become a grandmother again. What would\u2019ve happened if Jordan had stayed home from the lake that day? It was a question that still haunted her, maybe even more so now that her children were adults. What kind of person would Jordan have been? Would he have a family now? How different would her own life be? Her ex-husband, Stan\u2019s? Justine\u2019s? Even James\u2019s? They\u2019d all been profoundly affected by Jordan\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly imagine it,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cA mother never forgets,\u201d she said simply. The pain wasn\u2019t as intense as it\u2019d been during the first few years after Jordan\u2019s death. Still, at special moments like today\u2019s lunch with Justine, it was as if the loss had just occurred.</p><p>A car rounded the bend and she recognized it as her brother\u2019s. Jack saw the car, too. Standing, Jack and Olivia walked down the steps to greet their guest.</p><p>Will joined them. \u201cThanks for the dinner invite,\u201d he said, then kissed Olivia on the cheek and shook hands with Jack.</p><p>\u201cI should be the one thanking you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI\u2019m getting steak for the first time in a month of Sundays.\u201d</p><p>Olivia cast a disparaging look at her husband. \u201cIgnore him.\u201d</p><p>While Jack got Will a glass of iced tea, Olivia led her brother onto the porch, where they sat on two of the wicker chairs that lined the wide veranda. She\u2019d initially planned to have their conversation after dinner, but decided sooner was better. Jack brought out the tea, eyed Olivia and then excused himself, telling them he wanted to start the barbecue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice here. Really peaceful,\u201d Will commented, relaxing in his chair. He looked out over the Cove, where a pair of herons waded in the water, seeking dinner.</p><p>\u201cWe love it.\u201d</p><p>Will nodded, then sipped his tea.</p><p>Olivia plunged into the murky waters of her brother\u2019s obsessive behavior. \u201cGrace mentioned that you stopped by the library the other day.\u201d</p><p>Will didn\u2019t respond right away. \u201cI thought she might\u2019ve said something,\u201d he finally muttered.</p><p>Olivia wanted to get to the point. Surely Will knew why she felt the need to talk to him. \u201cYou\u2019re aware that she\u2019s married, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Will sighed and shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think, Liv. I made a fool of myself over her the last time I was in town. I regret that. The whole situation was unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>That was putting it mildly, although Olivia chose not to say so. Her brother had tried to provoke a fistfight with Cliff Harding, which was almost a joke. Cliff outweighed Will by at least fifty pounds and was in much better physical condition. The incident had mortified Grace, and Olivia had been outraged by her brother\u2019s childish behavior.</p><p>\u201cExactly why are you in Cedar Cove?\u201d she demanded. \u201cBecause if it has anything to do with Grace, I\u2019m telling you right now, neither Mom nor I will stand for it.\u201d</p><p>Her brother seemed about to argue, then appeared to change his mind. \u201cI know stopping by the library wasn\u2019t a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t. You\u2019re my brother and I love you, but Grace has been my best friend my entire life and I will not allow you to interfere in her marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Will leaned forward and exhaled slowly. \u201cI see now that inviting her to lunch wasn\u2019t the best way to go about any of this. All I wanted to say was that I\u2019m sorry for...well, for everything. I wish her happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit, moving to Cedar Cove looks pretty suspicious.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cI thought about it quite a bit, Olivia, but I really didn\u2019t have anywhere else to go. I needed a change. God knows Georgia deserved a better husband, and it just seemed easier to start over someplace familiar. Mom\u2019s here and you\u2019re here. The two of you, plus your kids, are the only family I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t intend to make any trouble for Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he returned with such vehemence that Olivia felt she had to believe him.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019d like,\u201d he continued, \u201cis to buy a business or start my own, I haven\u2019t decided which. Cedar Cove is home. I have the skills\u2014and the cash\u2014to make a contribution to this community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Olivia wanted to trust that what he said was true.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard of anything that might be appropriate?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Olivia thought for a moment and then inspiration struck. \u201cOh, my goodness! This is perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Will\u2019s eyes widened with excitement.</p><p>\u201cThe HarborStreetArtGallery. I just found out it\u2019s going to close. You\u2019ve always had an interest in the arts.\u201d He nodded eagerly at that, and she remembered how, years ago, he used to take very good photographs. He\u2019d always bought paintings, too, supporting up-and-coming artists. \u201cThe gallery was doing well until Maryellen Bowman had to quit,\u201d Olivia went on to explain. \u201cThe woman who replaced her just didn\u2019t have the eye or the business savvy Maryellen does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould I be able to hire Maryellen back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you wouldn\u2019t need to. You could manage it yourself. The community needs this art gallery and I really think you\u2019re the right person.\u201d The more she thought about it, the more Olivia warmed to the idea. \u201cTalk to Maryellen. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be willing to help you as much as she can. Keep in mind that she\u2019s a new mother, so her time is limited. She\u2019s also Grace\u2019s daughter, but that shouldn\u2019t matter\u2014should it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will looked pleased, disregarding the comment about Grace. \u201cI\u2019ll call her first thing in the morning. I can get her number from you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cShe can give you the contact information for the owners, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at each other in mutual understanding, and Olivia\u2019s heart felt lightened.</p> <p>As if on cue, Jack reappeared. \u201cThe grill\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>She and Will walked into the house.</p><p>Jack took the three T-bone steaks out of the refrigerator. While they watched, he rubbed both sides with olive oil, a grilling trick he\u2019d learned from an interview with a local chef. Collecting the silverware and plates, Will and Olivia followed him outside.</p><p>The phone rang and for a moment, Olivia was tempted not to answer. At the last second, she hurried into the house and grabbed it.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, it\u2019s your mother,\u201d Charlotte announced.</p> <p>As if Olivia wouldn\u2019t recognize her own mother\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrupting your dinner, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, not at all. What can I do for you?\u201d From the way Charlotte spoke, Olivia could tell she was worried. \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Charlotte murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but...well, I felt I should say something. I don\u2019t want to cause any problems or borrow trouble, but I think forewarned is forearmed, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, what are you talking about? Has anything happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, not yet, but I wonder if you should speak to Grace and Cliff.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t need any more information to figure it out. \u201cThis is about Will, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Little did her mother know that her brother was on their patio at that very moment, talking to Jack.</p><p>\u201cWill stopped by the other day and while he was here he saw a piece of mail on the kitchen counter. Although the envelope was addressed to Ben and me, Will didn\u2019t hesitate to take the card out and read it. I suspect he noticed the name on the return address.\u201d Her mother was getting upset now and her words were rushed.</p><p>\u201cWho was the card from?\u201d Olivia asked calmly.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a card exactly. It was an invitation to Grace and Cliff\u2019s wedding reception.\u201d</p><p>All at once, everything her brother had said came under suspicion. Olivia was no longer sure she could believe his assertions that he\u2019d put the past behind him.</p><p>\u201cI told him how happy Grace and Cliff are,\u201d Charlotte continued. \u201cHe just kept looking at the invitation and I\u2019m afraid...well, if you must know, I\u2019m afraid he was memorizing the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, do you seriously believe Will would come to the reception uninvited?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, Olivia, I have no idea what to believe. I can\u2019t imagine that any son of mine would be so forward or so rude, but then I don\u2019t really know Will anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Will to do anything that would embarrass Grace and Cliff. He\u2019s made a pest of himself more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom,\u201d she said again. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear. I feel much better now.\u201d</p><p>While she had her mother on the phone, Olivia shared Justine\u2019s news, which ended their conversation on a positive note. Before she hung up, Olivia confirmed that she\u2019d handle the situation with Will.</p><p>She realized, as she replaced the receiver, that even a year ago, her mother would never have come to her over something like this. Charlotte was beginning to show her age. Olivia shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, and yet...</p><p>Until recently, her mother had seemed invincible, full of life and energy. She\u2019d led a group of senior citizens against city hall, single-handedly held together the knitting group and organized any number of charitable enterprises. For the last three years she\u2019d been the president of the garden club. Suddenly Olivia saw her mother in a new light. Older, growing fragile, overwhelmed by concerns that wouldn\u2019t have intimidated her a short time ago.</p><p>As Olivia was about to turn away, she noticed the flashing red light, indicating a message.</p><p>Jack walked into the house to get her. \u201cThe steaks are done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d She reached for the pencil and pad she kept by the phone and pushed the recall button.</p><p>\u201cMs. Lockhart-Griffin, this is the Women\u2019s DiagnosticCenter. We\u2019re calling about your mammogram. Would you please contact our office at your earliest convenience? Our office hours are from eight to five, Monday through Friday.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stared at Jack as dread clutched her stomach.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing,\u201d he said in what seemed like a determined effort to reassure her.</p><p>\u201cIf it was nothing they would\u2019ve sent a letter the way they normally do,\u201d Olivia whispered. \u201cSomething must\u2019ve shown up on my mammogram.\u201d</p><p>Instantly Jack was at her side. \u201cWe\u2019ll phone them tomorrow, Olivia. Together. No matter what it is, I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded numbly. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later.\u201d For now they had company and she didn\u2019t want this to get to her mother. Charlotte had enough to worry about without adding a cancer scare to her concerns. No, they\u2019d get through dinner with Will and deal with the phone call once he\u2019d left.</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Teri realized she couldn\u2019t keep her pregnancy from Bobby much longer. Everyone at the salon knew\u2014even her sister had guessed\u2014but Teri still hadn\u2019t told her husband. With good reason. If Bobby was protective of her now, and he was almost obsessive about it, this would only make matters worse. She didn\u2019t want to give up her job; she enjoyed it and as a gregarious, friendly person, she needed the social outlet the salon provided. Even Bobby had noticed a change in her spirits since she\u2019d returned to work.</p><p>Teri had some serious concerns regarding her husband. He wasn\u2019t happy, and she knew why. He needed to play chess. He missed the game, the challenge and even the travel. When they\u2019d first met, he\u2019d been involved in chess matches around the world every few weeks.</p><p>When she questioned him, he assured her there were no significant matches scheduled now or in the near future. More importantly, he told her, he wasn\u2019t ready. That meant Bobby didn\u2019t feel prepared to face the Russian player he\u2019d mentioned earlier.</p><p>Teri was so unfamiliar with the game and with the chess world that she didn\u2019t know how to communicate with him about it. She might be married to a champion but she understood chess about as well as he grasped the basics of a good haircut. What she did know was that he should be playing\u2014just like she should be working at her own job.</p><p>The telephone rang and Teri automatically answered it. Bobby rarely heard the phone, especially if he was studying chess moves, which he did every day. It was her sister.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard from you in a while,\u201d Christie said conversationally. \u201cEverything\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Teri had no intention of sharing her concerns with Christie, although their relationship had definitely improved.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I should have you and Bobby to dinner soon, you know, reciprocate for the times you\u2019ve had me over.\u201d</p><p>The invitation surprised Teri and pleased her. Originally she\u2019d invited Christie back in the hope of encouraging a romance between her and James. Lately, though, she\u2019d come to enjoy Christie\u2019s company. For the first time in her adult life, she felt like she had a real sister. As for the romance Teri had hoped to see between Bobby\u2019s driver and Christie, nothing had come of it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to have dinner at your place,\u201d Teri told her. \u201cLet\u2019s arrange something soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told Bobby about the baby yet?\u201d Christie asked, her voice falling to a whisper.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said in the same chatty tone. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll bring something. I wouldn\u2019t dream of letting you make the whole meal on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby\u2019s listening?\u201d her sister guessed.</p><p>Probably not, but Teri wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p>She was about to say goodbye when her sister said, \u201cUh, Teri...\u201d There was a pause. \u201cListen, don\u2019t read anything into this, but I\u2019d like to ask you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Christie seemed to hesitate again. \u201cIt\u2019s about James.\u201d</p><p>Teri straightened and, catching her husband\u2019s eye, gave him the thumbs-up signal. When Bobby frowned and shook his head, she mouthed the words, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d Teri asked, returning to her sister.</p><p>\u201cWell...just some information. He\u2019s so...odd. What can you tell me about him?\u201d</p><p>Teri had never really asked. James was James, and she\u2019d heard very little about his background. He seemed too private for nosy personal questions. \u201cHe\u2019s Bobby\u2019s friend as much as he is his driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do all day? When he isn\u2019t driving you or Bobby around, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sometimes he waits for me at the shop\u2014doing his bodyguard thing. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m interested or anything, you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Teri said, glad Christie couldn\u2019t see her smile.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, the last time he took me home, I told him I didn\u2019t want him to drive me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Bobby hadn\u2019t said a word to her about that, and Teri suspected James hadn\u2019t mentioned it to him.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t do or say anything to upset you, did he?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing bad, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about, but he...he brought me a long-stemmed red rose. Twice.\u201d</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t think that was so terrible. \u201cHow sweet,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do something like that?\u201d Christie demanded.</p><p>Teri had been right all along. James was attracted to her sister and, if she was reading Christie correctly, her sister was attracted to him. But Christie was afraid in exactly the same way Teri had been when Bobby had first started paying attention to her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to ask him about the roses?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>\u201cNo! Please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>Teri arched her eyebrows. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so...refined. It makes me uncomfortable. He calls me miss. That\u2019s such an outdated term! And he...he insists on escorting me to my door. Except the last time,\u201d she rushed to add, \u201cwhen I didn\u2019t give him the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know his mother was English and his father an American.\u201d That much she\u2019d heard from Bobby once.</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem to be the information Christie was looking for.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to say anything to Bobby?\u201d Teri asked. \u201cTell him you\u2019d prefer not to have James drive you?\u201d</p><p>Her sister hesitated briefly, then murmured, \u201cMaybe not. I guess it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They ended the conversation soon after.

Only...she\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Teri walked over to where he sat, climbed into his lap and slipped her arms around his neck. \u201cI was afraid, too. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll I remember is how frightened I was that you might not love me.\u201d</p><p>His words melted her heart. \u201cOh, Bobby, I\u2019ve always loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>They exchanged a few very gratifying kisses, and then Teri left to make dinner.</p><p>She\u2019d just begun frying hamburger for one of her comfort-food casseroles when she started to retch. The aroma of cooking meat triggered a nausea so severe, she immediately rushed to the downstairs powder room. Thank goodness for a house with four bathrooms! She didn\u2019t think she could\u2019ve made it up the stairs.</p><p>Bobby must have heard, because he was in the hallway outside waiting for her when she\u2019d finished throwing up. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d he asked urgently.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cFlu? Food poisoning? Should I phone the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call for James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby, no!\u201d</p><p>A deep frowned creased his face as he studied her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly okay now,\u201d she assured him. \u201cDinner will be ready soon, but if you don\u2019t mind, I think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>Bobby didn\u2019t take his eyes off her and Teri sighed. She was doing her husband a grave disservice by keeping the pregnancy a secret.</p> <p>\u201cI need to talk to you,\u201d she whispered. Taking him by the hand, she guided Bobby back into the living room and urged him down onto the sofa. Then she sat in his lap again and rested her head on his shoulder.</p><p>Bobby held her close.</p><p>Teri wondered how to lead up to her revelation and then decided on the direct approach. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>For a moment he didn\u2019t say anything, but when she leaned back to get a better look at his face, he gave her the biggest, sweetest smile, a smile of such joy that tears threatened to fill her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m due in March.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the news with his usual composure. \u201cYou will be a good mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildbirth will be easy. You have wide hips.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, it won\u2019t be that easy, no matter how wide my hips are. And do we have to keep talking about my size?\u201d</p><p>Bobby ignored that. \u201cI\u2019ll be there with you.\u201d He pressed his forehead to hers and laughed. \u201cA baby,\u201d he murmured. \u201cA baby.\u201d She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d heard him sound so happy. The stress of the past few weeks had taken its toll on him, and she was afraid this pregnancy would only add to his worries.</p><p>Then, just as suddenly as he\u2019d begun to laugh, he stopped. The happiness seemed to drain out of him. The change in him was so complete, so striking, that Teri instantly realized he was worried about her, frightened by the Russian\u2019s threat.</p><p>\u201cThe baby is why you\u2019ve been so tired lately?\u201d he asked anxiously. \u201cAnd why you were sick?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe nausea\u2019s going to end very soon\u2014most women only have it for the first three months, and I\u2019m almost there now. So don\u2019t worry about me. Promise you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to be happy.\u201d All she needed to do was look in his eyes to see the truth. Bobby was ecstatic\u2014and at the same time, terrified.</p><p>The doorbell buzzed, and Bobby let her go. She wasn\u2019t expecting any deliveries, nor had she invited any family or friends. Although, now that she thought about it, she wouldn\u2019t be opposed to seeing Christie. Or Rachel. She felt like celebrating. Telling Bobby seemed to make the pregnancy official.</p><p>As soon as she opened the door, Teri recognized her mistake in not checking the peephole first. At least ten people stood on the other side, crowded together, each angling for position. Cameras flashed and Teri instinctively raised her hands to her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you Bobby Polgar\u2019s wife?\u201d someone shouted at her.</p><p>\u201cWho are you people?\u201d Teri shouted back.</p><p>A microphone was thrust toward her. \u201cCan you tell us why Bobby\u2019s dropped out of the chess world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe most certainly has not,\u201d Teri cried.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t shown up at any of the matches he was scheduled to compete in for the last four months,\u201d someone else yelled.</p><p>\u201cNo one knew where to find him,\u201d a different reporter added.</p><p>\u201cHas he been in hiding?\u201d asked another.</p><p>Both major 24-hour news channels were represented, she saw. Their trucks blocked the driveway. \u201cBobby hasn\u2019t been hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d a man asked.</p><p>Her husband moved behind her, and the cameras started flashing again.</p><p>\u201cBobby!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby.\u201d</p><p>His name came from every direction. Bobby gently pushed Teri behind him, then faced the crowd of reporters.</p><p>\u201cHave you quit chess?\u201d one of them asked.</p><p>\u201cAre the rumors true? Have you surrendered your crown to Aleksandr Vladimir?\u201d</p><p>With everyone shouting questions at him, it was impossible for Bobby to answer. He held up his hand, indicating that he was willing to speak. A hush fell over those assembled.</p><p>\u201cNo comment.\u201d With that, he eased back and quietly closed the door. With his arm around Teri\u2019s waist, he led her out of the foyer. Then, as calmly as if this didn\u2019t matter at all, he called the sheriff\u2019s office and reported that there were trespassers on his property.</p><p>\u201cBobby,\u201d she said when he turned back to her. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep this up. You\u2019ve got to play sooner or later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised. \u201cWhen I\u2019m ready, but not before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you surrender your title to Vladimir,\u201d Teri insisted. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to use me as bait. Don\u2019t fall for it.\u201d But she knew that Bobby\u2019s concern for her was even greater now that she\u2019d told him about the baby\u2014just as she\u2019d feared.</p><p>\u201cOne thing I vow to you,\u201d Bobby said, taking her hands in his and raising them to his lips. \u201cVladimir will never hold my title. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone told the press where to find you,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Bobby agreed, frowning. \u201cI know who it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out. This was Vladimir\u2019s effort to force Bobby to the chess table.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be in Cedar Cove this Saturday to visit my son,\u201d Faith told Troy on Thursday evening. He hadn\u2019t seen her in a couple of weeks, although they spoke on the phone almost every night. Faith had listed her house in South Seattle, and several potential buyers had already come to see it. No offers yet, but he knew it would happen soon.</p><p>He felt both dread and excitement about Faith\u2019s move to Cedar Cove. He still hadn\u2019t told his daughter about this relationship. The guilt he\u2019d felt after Megan\u2019s miscarriage had destroyed his pleasure in seeing Faith. Logically, rationally, he understood that being with her had nothing to do with the loss of his grandchild. Still, he couldn\u2019t forget the fact that he hadn\u2019t been available when his daughter needed him.</p><p>\u201cI...I was hoping,\u201d Faith continued, \u201cthat I might see you while I was in town.\u201d</p><p>Troy hated to turn her down. At the same time, he dared not risk Megan finding out. Not after what had happened. \u201cI\u2019m very busy down at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven on a weekend?\u201d</p><p>He should be honest with Faith. She deserved that and he despised himself for being so weak.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter doesn\u2019t like the idea of you seeing anyone, does she?\u201d Faith asked bluntly.</p><p>Troy felt a measure of relief. At least the truth was in the open now, although it should have come from him. \u201cI don\u2019t know that she ever will,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have.\u201d He sighed deeply. \u201cI was afraid that if I told you how Megan feels, you\u2019d suggest we not talk to each other anymore.\u201d Troy didn\u2019t think he could cope with that. Their conversations were the highlight of his day; he could hardly wait to get home because then he could talk to Faith. They must have discussed every subject under the sun\u2014except his daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d miss talking to you, Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would?\u201d Her saying so instantly gave him hope. \u201cBut it\u2019s not fair to leave you hanging like this. I can\u2019t even promise that anything\u2019s going to change with Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTroy, it\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t worry. Everything will work itself out in time.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so confident....</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you on Saturday,\u201d Troy said, coming to a decision. As much as he loved his daughter and as much as he regretted the miscarriage, he had his own life.</p><p>In fact, he doubted he could stay away from Scott Beckwith\u2019s house, knowing Faith was in town. Now that he\u2019d given himself permission to see her, the guilt shrank, replaced with a sense of anticipation. He\u2019d be with her in a couple of days!</p><p>\u201cI knit you something,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you knit?\u201d The idea of her doing this thrilled him and the happiness he felt warmed him from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cSocks,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d</p><p>Faith giggled. \u201cYes, silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have big feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that about you,\u201d she said in a wry voice that made him laugh. \u201cThose high-school dances. My poor scuffed shoes.\u201d</p><p>That led to a brief reminiscence of the Friday-night dances at Cedar Cove High and the songs they\u2019d particularly liked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking my son and his family to dinner,\u201d Faith said next. \u201cWould you like to join us? We\u2019re going to D.D.\u2019s on the Cove.\u201d</p><p>He considered the invitation and then decided to decline. It was one thing to see Faith privately, another to flaunt it. Megan would find out soon enough and he\u2019d rather be the one to tell her. He didn\u2019t want her hearing gossip from some busybody.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better not. Should I pick you up at your son\u2019s house at eight? Will that give you enough time?\u201d He already knew where he\u2019d take her.... But he\u2019d save it for Saturday night. Surprise her.</p><p>\u201cThat would be fine. Where are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>His mood was almost jovial as he put down the phone. Then, on impulse, he reached for his car keys and headed out the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He drove to the cemetery. He\u2019d only been there once since Sandy\u2019s funeral, but that didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t think about her. He did, every single day. After all the years they\u2019d been together, Sandy was part of him. She always would be. Troy wished he knew how to convey that to his daughter, how to tell Megan that his relationship with Faith or any other woman would never diminish his love for Sandy. He wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d accept his words. Wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to.</p><p>He parked and walked over the damp green lawn to the gravesite. The array of pink carnations told him Megan had recently come by. He suspected she was a frequent visitor, coming as often as two or three times a week.</p><p>For long minutes all he did was stare down at the headstone. He was tempted to speak to Sandy, tell her about Faith. But his wife wasn\u2019t there. Not the real Sandy, the person she\u2019d been, the woman he\u2019d loved. Like Megan, he believed she\u2019d gone to heaven, released at last from sickness and pain. He couldn\u2019t imagine her anywhere else.</p><p>When he thought about it, he realized there was really nothing to tell her, other than the fact that he\u2019d kissed another woman. What astonished him was how good he felt about being with Faith. In his heart, he believed that Sandy would approve. Megan might have a hard time condoning it, but he didn\u2019t think Sandy would object. More than that, she\u2019d encourage him to grab hold of any chance at happiness.</p> <p>The marble headstone was polished and new. He bent down to run his finger along the carved letters. Sandra Marie Davis. 1949-2007. That said so little about the kind of woman she\u2019d been. Never in all the years that she\u2019d battled MS had she complained. Nor did she curse her lot or question God. He\u2019d been married to a very special woman and not once had Troy forgotten that. Not while Sandy was alive and not now.</p><p>Troy pressed his fingers to his lips and touched them to the gravestone, then walked slowly back to his car. Still unwilling to return to an empty house, he decided to visit his daughter and son-in-law.</p><p>Megan flew into his arms the minute she opened the front door. \u201cOh, Daddy, it\u2019s so wonderful to see you.\u201d</p><p>She looked much better than she had a few weeks ago, he thought, hugging her back.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly remember the last time you came by,\u201d she said, and he heard the chiding in her tone.</p> <p>Troy understood what had kept him away. Guilt. He was sorry he\u2019d allowed that to happen.</p><p>His daughter had the same gift of hospitality as her mother. He was immediately ushered into the family room and handed a cup of coffee with extra cream and sugar, just the way he liked it. Megan had dessert out and had cut him a slice of pecan pie before he could protest.</p><p>\u201cCraig and I are going to the ocean this weekend,\u201d Megan said, carrying in dessert plates for herself and her husband.</p><p>Craig thanked her and Megan sat down beside him. \u201cI figured we could both use a weekend away,\u201d his son-in-law explained. \u201cSo I booked us into a place at CannonBeach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d Troy probably exhibited more enthusiasm than warranted. Not only did he think this would be good for Megan, with his daughter away, he\u2019d be free to enjoy Faith\u2019s visit. Okay, fine, so he had his own agenda. But he didn\u2019t want Megan hurt\u2014and he wanted to see Faith. For the moment, he felt as if he\u2019d been handed a reprieve.</p><p>Before he left, Troy got the name of the hotel where Megan and Craig would be staying. As soon as he got home, he ordered champagne for their room. A romantic weekend was exactly what his daughter needed\u2014and so did he.</p> <p>Saturday evening, Troy was dressed by five o\u2019clock. He shaved, combed his hair, then watched the clock for nearly three hours, pacing and periodically turning on the TV to pass the time. Precisely at eight, he parked outside Scott Beckwith\u2019s house on a street close to Rosewood Lane</p><p>. He was just climbing out of the car when Faith opened the screen door and stepped outside to greet him. Her son, Scott, was with her and the two of them had a brief conversation. Troy recognized Scott from seeing him around town but hadn\u2019t known, of course, that he was Faith\u2019s son.</p><p>After a quick introduction, Faith ran in to get her bag, leaving Troy to exchange awkward remarks with her son. Troy was conscious of being carefully assessed but he didn\u2019t sense that Scott disliked him or disapproved. A far cry from Megan.</p><p>He and Faith walked to his car a few minutes later. She\u2019d worn a simple green long-sleeved dress and had thrown a lacy knit shawl over her shoulders. Her beauty left him nearly breathless.</p><p>\u201cYou look...\u201d He struggled for the right word. \u201cAmazing,\u201d he concluded, convinced he sounded like a tongue-tied nincompoop. Whenever he was around Faith, he had to remind himself that he was a responsible adult in a position of trust.</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d she said with a light laugh. \u201cOh, I have your socks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear them every day.\u201d They\u2019d remind him of her, not that he needed reminding.</p><p>He held open the car door for her, the same way he had in high school\u2014the same way he had for Sandy. His father had drilled manners into him from an early age and they\u2019d stayed with him all these years.</p> <p>Once inside the car, Faith asked, \u201cAre you ready to tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She smiled over at him.</p><p>Clutching the wheel with tense hands, Troy started his car. He wished he could kiss her right then and there, but he resisted. Not in front of her son\u2019s house! And not where Megan might hear about it...</p><p>After ten minutes of driving through back streets, Faith seemed to guess their destination. \u201cTroy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going where I think you\u2019re going\u2014are you?\u201d</p><p>He took the winding road up Briar Patch Hill. One surreptitious glance told him Faith had figured it out.</p><p>\u201cTroy! This is where we used to come to neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you remember,\u201d he said softly, enjoying the tinge of pink that colored her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt had the best view of the lighthouse,\u201d Faith said, her voice husky. \u201cI\u2019m surprised someone hasn\u2019t built a house here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s county property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know how many other girls you brought up here,\u201d she said with mock sternness.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d That was true. Not even Sandy. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember the first time we parked up here?\u201d</p><p>Troy wasn\u2019t likely to forget. His father had let him take the car. He and Faith had gone to a basketball game and afterward they\u2019d attended the school dance. About halfway through, he\u2019d suggested that since he had a car, they go for a drive. Faith had agreed. They\u2019d parked up here, on the bluff overlooking the Cove.</p><p>Troy, however, couldn\u2019t remember a single thing about the view; what he did remember was kissing Faith. Holding her...They\u2019d returned to their favorite spot many times after that. He liked to consider this place theirs, although a lot of other couples had claimed it, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind, Troy Davis?\u201d Faith teased when he parked the car and turned off the ignition. It was dark now and the lights around the Cove glittered brightly, reflecting on the water.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty view, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Troy stretched his arm across the back of her seat.</p><p>\u201cAs I recall, the last time we were here, there were no bucket seats and no console between us,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe can compensate for that.\u201d Troy leaned toward her. Faith shifted closer to him and their lips met. Although it was a bit clumsy, his arms came around her and she leaned into him. The kiss was everything he\u2019d anticipated, everything he wanted it to be.</p><p>When they broke apart, Faith\u2019s head was on his shoulder. He certainly wasn\u2019t comfortable in that position, but he didn\u2019t care. Faith was in his arms. Again.</p><p>\u201cI think time has only enhanced the experience,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Faith responded with a sweet smile. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d</p><p>Because it was too tempting to resist, Troy kissed her again. They were both breathing hard when he finished.</p><p>\u201cI took your bra off here, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, Troy.\u201d She sounded flustered that he\u2019d reminded her of that. In retrospect, it\u2019d been a comedy of errors. He\u2019d wanted to be sophisticated, pretending he knew all about a woman\u2019s intimate apparel. As it turned out, the closure had been at the front, not the back, and taking pity on him, Faith had finally aided his addled efforts. No matter how much he\u2019d embarrassed himself, though, the result had been worth it.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, you remember.\u201d And so did he\u2014every detail.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suggest trying the same technique this time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He didn\u2019t intend to, but the memory was a pleasant one.</p><p>\u201cI wear support bras now and they\u2019re even more complicated than the ones I wore as a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven help me.\u201d He couldn\u2019t refrain from touching her, just to see. Then they were kissing again, reveling in each other.</p><p>All at once there was a flashing blue-and-red light behind them.</p><p>Faith pulled away from him and fumbled with the front of her dress. \u201cOh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.\u201d She sounded seventeen again.</p><p>Troy dragged a calming breath through his teeth, then stepped out of the car.</p><p>The young officer instantly paled. \u201cSheriff Davis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s all right here, Payne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. S-sorry, sir.\u201d The kid was almost inarticulate in his desperation to escape.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. You were just doing your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d The patrolman was in his car as fast as his feet would move. Within seconds, he\u2019d driven away.</p><p>Opening the car door, Troy got back inside. Faith looked at him and they both dissolved into giggles.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>Maryellen Bowman was so excited she could barely contain herself. Two important phone calls had come that afternoon, each one bringing good news.</p><p>Nursing Drake while Katie sat next to her holding a book and pretending to read to her baby brother, Maryellen let her mind race with the possibilities for Jon and his future as a photographer.</p><p>Just a couple of weeks earlier, Maryellen had received news that had distressed her. The owners of the Harbor Street Gallery had definitely decided to close their doors. She felt as if the years she\u2019d spent as the gallery manager, building up the clientele and forging relationships with local artists, had been for nothing. Apparently, without her there to oversee everything, sales had fallen off to the point that it was financially infeasible to continue the business. Lois Habbersmith, who\u2019d assumed Maryellen\u2019s role, felt dreadful and blamed herself. She\u2019d never been comfortable in a managerial position and admittedly wasn\u2019t as good with either the artists or the customers as Maryellen.</p><p>Still, Maryellen had hoped sales would pick up during the summer, but that hadn\u2019t happened. Aware of her distress, Jon had suggested she return to work part-time. The owners had wanted that, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maryellen had agonized over that decision, but in the end she knew she couldn\u2019t. Not with a newborn and a toddler. Her primary concern had to be her own family. When she told Jon, she saw the relief in his eyes\u2014but if she\u2019d wanted to go back to work, her husband would have honored her decision. Thankfully, Jon desired the same things she did. Family came before anything else, even if that meant sacrifices.</p><p>The first call was from Will Jefferson, the brother of her mother\u2019s best friend. Will said he was interested in buying the Harbor Street Gallery and asked if he could stop by later that afternoon to discuss it. Maryellen felt slightly uncomfortable about this; Will, after all, was the man who\u2019d come between Cliff and her mother. But if he bought the gallery, he\u2019d make a real difference to Cedar Cove, a positive difference, and she was grateful for that possibility. So naturally, she\u2019d agreed to the meeting, although she\u2019d made it plain that she wouldn\u2019t be able to work for him.</p><p>The second exciting call followed within the hour. During a ten-minute conversation with artists\u2019 agent Marc Albright, Jon\u2019s financial future had changed. Marc wanted to represent Jon\u2019s work. The opportunities, he said, were endless. Maryellen had researched artists\u2019 representatives and e-mailed a number of the most reputable, then sent them samples of Jon\u2019s photographs. It had paid off.</p><p>Now Jon would be able to devote all his working time to photography. While she was pregnant with Drake, he\u2019d found employment taking school pictures. Maryellen knew how much he hated that, although he\u2019d never complained. He was doing what he had to in order to pay the bills.</p> <p>Her biggest fear was that the job would kill Jon\u2019s love for photography. Until the fire that burned down The Lighthouse, he\u2019d supplemented their income by working as a chef. With that fire had gone his employment. The restaurant had provided a steady\u2014and reasonably good\u2014salary, so they felt the financial loss immediately.</p><p>And yet, in unexpected ways, the fire had actually been a blessing.</p><p>If not for the arson, the rift between her husband and his parents might never have been settled. If not for the fire, Jon might\u2019ve been content to work as a chef and keep his photography as a sideline business.</p><p>Behind a camera, Jon came alive. His photographs of the rainforest were so vivid, viewers felt that if they reached out and touched the print, their fingers would come away moist.</p><p>Until they\u2019d started seeing each other, he didn\u2019t often take photos of people. But after Katie\u2019s birth and then Drake\u2019s, he\u2019d taken thousands of family pictures. Maryellen had to admit she was self-conscious about the photographs he\u2019d done of her but when she looked at them objectively, she could see what other people did. A man\u2019s love for a woman. A mother\u2019s love for a child. Still, her favorite was a picture of his father gazing down at the infant in his arms. Joseph\u2019s craggy face, juxtaposed against the smooth, soft lines of the infant\u2019s, was so moving it could bring her to tears.</p> <p>But Jon\u2019s scenic work was where he truly excelled. One of his best-known was of an eagle in flight, wings in a graceful arc, poised above the blue-green waters of Puget Sound. Another was of a ferry crossing with Mt.Rainier in the background. An art gallery in Seattle routinely sold his work, as did the Harbor Street Gallery; unfortunately, the money he made as a photographer hadn\u2019t been enough to support their family. That, however, was about to change.</p><p>Shortly after Drake was born, Jon had begun another job as a chef, working at Anthony\u2019s HomePort in GigHarbor. It meant he could quit his job with the photo studio, which was a plus, but the hours were a problem. Because he had the evening shift, Maryellen was alone with the children most nights. The benefit was that her husband could spend the mornings with Katie and Drake. Maryellen loved him all the more for the way he treasured their children.</p><p>She heard a car door slam and eased a sleeping Drake onto her shoulder as she went to the door. When she didn\u2019t recognize the man who stepped out of the car, she assumed it must be Will Jefferson. As quickly as she could, she straightened the living room, collecting toys, cups, books and magazines, and rushing them to the kitchen. Katie attempted to help, but her efforts only added to the general chaos.</p><p>There was a knock at the door. She opened it, slightly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen Bowman?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>She nodded and nearly tripped over her daughter, who grabbed hold of her leg. \u201cKatie,\u201d she chastised, moving the little girl out of her way. \u201cWatch where you are.\u201d Her reprimand had no effect. Katie wrapped her arm around Maryellen\u2019s thigh and clung to her mother.</p> <p>\u201cYou must be Will Jefferson,\u201d she said, choosing to ignore the child hanging from her leg.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Will smiled at Katie, who finally stepped aside. He came into the house.</p><p>Looking at the living room through his eyes, Maryellen felt compelled to apologize. \u201cPlease excuse the mess, but as you can see I\u2019ve got my hands full here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>They sat down on the sofa and when she offered him refreshments, Will declined. Just as well, because all she had was apple juice and graham crackers.</p><p>After some casual conversation, Will produced a pad and pen and asked a series of detailed, intelligent questions. Maryellen answered them to the best of her ability. Judging by the things he wanted to know about the gallery, the local artists and the sales when she was manager, Will Jefferson would do an excellent job\u2014if he bought the place. The fact that he lavishly praised Jon\u2019s work endeared him even more.</p><p>\u201cI do hope you give this serious consideration,\u201d Maryellen told him when he\u2019d finished. \u201cThe gallery\u2019s been part of this community for a long time. Everyone is upset that it\u2019s going to close.\u201d</p><p>Will glanced over his notes. \u201cAfter I talk to a couple more people, including my accountant, I\u2019m going to contact the owners and see if we can come to an agreement. This sounds like exactly the kind of opportunity I was hoping to find.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt would be wonderful to see the gallery back the way it used to be,\u201d she said wistfully.</p><p>Just as Will was getting ready to leave, Maryellen heard another car door close. She hadn\u2019t had company in several days and two guests in the same afternoon was certainly unexpected.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better be going,\u201d Will said, coming to his feet. He smiled at Katie again and the little girl shrieked and buried her face in the sofa.</p><p>Shaking her head, Maryellen saw him to the door and noticed Cliff Harding, her stepfather, climbing out of his truck. They stared at each other, and Maryellen remembered again what she\u2019d heard about Will Jefferson\u2014and her mother. Now the two men were meeting face to face. In her front yard.</p><p>Not sure what to do, Maryellen shut the door and stepped over to the window to watch. At first, both men maintained a respectable distance from each other. From the set of Cliff\u2019s shoulders, Maryellen could tell he was tense. But gradually his shoulders relaxed and after a few minutes, the two men approached each other and shook hands. Maryellen saw, to her astonishment, that they were smiling.</p><p>Will left first, and then Cliff came up to the house with a box of clothes Kelly had asked him to drop off for Drake. He couldn\u2019t stay. She didn\u2019t ask about his exchange with Will Jefferson; the way Maryellen figured it, whatever had taken place was their business.</p><p>That evening she received several other phone calls, including one from her mother, but she managed not to even hint at any of her exciting news. It just didn\u2019t seem right to tell anyone else before she spoke to Jon. She had to wait until Jon got home, though. Maryellen decided not to call him; he was too busy at the restaurant, and she wanted to see his face when she told him about Marc Albright. By the time the children were both asleep, she was pacing the floor, eager to talk to him.</p><p>When Jon finally walked in, it was after eleven. Generally she was in bed by then, and he seemed surprised to find her up. He looked tired; still, he smiled when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe this pleasure?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Without hesitation, Maryellen hurried toward him, slipping into his embrace and hugging him fiercely. \u201cOh, Jon! I have so much good news. I just couldn\u2019t go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard a rumor that the Harbor Street Gallery might have a buyer. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWill Jefferson is probably going to buy it. He stopped by to talk to me about my views on the current problems and how to resolve them. He seems very knowledgeable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have other news, too.\u201d</p><p>Jon regarded her with a mildly puzzled expression.</p><p>\u201cThis has to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She led the way to the living room. He sat down between a laundry basket piled with folded baby clothes and a stack of freshly washed towels. She remained standing. \u201cDo you remember all those weeks I spent living on this sofa?\u201d Although she asked the question, it was unlikely either of them would forget the long months of forced rest she\u2019d had to endure.</p><p>\u201cThis is a trick question, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s rhetorical. I spent the first few weeks worrying because there was so little I could do, and you were run ragged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen,\u201d he said, reaching for her hands. \u201cThat\u2019s all in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, and I promise I\u2019ll get to the point in a minute. Just bear with me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He looked puzzled but Maryellen needed to tell the whole story and tell it her way.</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d she continued, \u201cdespite your own preferences, you asked your parents for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, let me finish.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to cut him off, but she was nearly bursting with what she had to tell him. \u201cI understand how hard that was for you, Jon.\u201d He\u2019d done it for her and Katie and the baby, and Maryellen would never forget that or what it had cost him.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Jon said, \u201cbefore you go any further with this. I don\u2019t want you seeing me as some wonderful hero. In case you\u2019ve forgotten, I wasn\u2019t happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and that makes what you did even more admirable.\u201d She smiled at him, tears gathering in her eyes. \u201cAnyway, while your family was here, I occupied my time trying to get you an agent.\u201d</p><p>Jon stared up at her. \u201cHow did we move from my parents being here to you finding me an agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it happened,\u201d she said, speaking quickly. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for your father and Ellen, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to spend all those hours on the computer or making all those phones calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying an agent\u2019s interested in me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMore than interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Marc Albright and he\u2019s already made two tentative sales of your photographs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready? What about the terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s limited use and Jon, oh, Jon, the money is fabulous.\u201d When she told him the figure, his eyebrows shot up in disbelief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLimited use?\u201d he asked. \u201cAs what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s being picked up for a print ad for an outdoor clothing franchise and the other\u2019s the backdrop for an author\u2019s promotional kit, which is being sent to booksellers and distributors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich shots?\u201d he asked, immediately curious, just as Maryellen had been. She had them ready and pulled out the two photographs for his inspection.</p><p>Jon glanced at them, then looked up, his eyes filled with shock\u2014as if, only now, had this become real to him.</p> <p>\u201cRemember how we talked about me being your manager one day?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, my beloved husband, that day has arrived.\u201d</p><p>Jon smiled widely. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful, Maryellen.\u201d He stood and hugged her, then announced that he needed a shower.</p><p>A shower? Jon wanted to go upstairs and take a shower? She\u2019d just delivered the best news of his career and all he could think about was a shower?</p> <p>Maryellen didn\u2019t allow her disappointment to show. She hadn\u2019t known Jon all these years for nothing; he needed to process this information in his own way.</p><p>When he\u2019d finished his shower, Maryellen was in bed. Drake would wake for his feeding soon. She considered waking him now and getting it over with so she could count on a few hours of uninterrupted sleep, but that wasn\u2019t a practice she wanted to start.</p><p>The moonlight shone through the uncurtained window. Jon kept the bedside lamp off as he slipped between the sheets. \u201cI did hear you right, didn\u2019t I? I have an agent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of the top agents in the country.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI did my research, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jon lifted her hair and dropped soft kisses on her neck.</p><p>When he stopped, Maryellen rolled onto her back and discovered him looking down at her, his head propped up on one elbow. \u201cHe\u2019d like to talk to you in the morning,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you only mention that now?\u201d</p><p>She grinned and threw her arms around him. \u201cAre you excited yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes my work?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen wanted to laugh out loud. \u201cHe thinks you\u2019re brilliant. And you are.\u201d</p><p>In response, Jon lowered his mouth to hers. Their kisses took on an urgency that matched their happiness, and soon he\u2019d divested Maryellen of her nightgown. When he moved over her, she sighed her welcome and arched up to receive him. They were familiar lovers and clung to each other afterward, their kisses warm and loving.</p><p>\u201cWhen I walked into the house, I thought I\u2019d fall asleep on my feet,\u201d Jon told her. \u201cI was that exhausted. Now I\u2019m so excited I don\u2019t know if I can sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Maryellen felt like giggling. \u201cI\u2019m dying to tell people. Mom phoned this evening and Rachel, too, and I didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d Her mother was a nervous wreck over the wedding reception; in fact, Maryellen had never seen her so unnerved by a social event. She\u2019d thought of saying something about Cliff and Will Jefferson, but hadn\u2019t. It all seemed too complicated, and she didn\u2019t feel she should involve herself or interfere.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can tell them now,\u201d Jon said sleepily.</p><p>Maryellen nodded. As a matter of fact, she intended to let the whole world know.</p><p>Cuddling up with her husband, Maryellen murmured, \u201cRachel and I had a long talk.\u201d</p><p>Jon made a noncommittal sound, obviously drifting off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to lose her,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jon mumbled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been seeing this navy guy and he recently got transferred. She really misses him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, but Maryellen didn\u2019t bother to explain, since Jon was more interested in sleeping. \u201cYou remember what it\u2019s like to be in love, don\u2019t you?\u201d she couldn\u2019t resist teasing.</p><p>\u201cSure do.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen could tell he was smiling. \u201cLots of benefits come along with it.\u201d Maryellen kissed his jaw. \u201cI think she might move to California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, your friend...\u201d His response was followed by a soft snore. For the next few minutes, she listened to Jon\u2019s deep, even breathing. He worked hard and was on his feet for a long, stressful shift. But that was about to change; soon his photography would bring in enough to meet their financial obligations.</p><p>Contented, Maryellen closed her eyes. She was almost asleep when Drake\u2019s hungry cry startled her. Her eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she whispered, tossing aside the covers and climbing out of bed. Although she\u2019d begun her new role as Jon\u2019s manager, her job right now was that of a mother. Just to make sure she remembered that, Drake squalled again.</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>The day of her reception had finally arrived. Preparing for it, trying to get all the details right, had made Grace more nervous than she\u2019d been about either of her weddings. Her first to Dan Sherman, shortly after her high-school graduation, had been a large formal affair. Olivia Jefferson had been her maid of honor, and she\u2019d had three bridesmaids. Her parents had invited a crowd of family and friends, some of whom she\u2019d never even met.</p><p>Wearing a traditional white wedding dress had been hypocritical, since Grace was nearly four months pregnant with Maryellen at the time. Her mother, who\u2019d wanted to keep the pregnancy quiet, had insisted, however. Grace had gone along with it, although she suspected that anyone looking at her would guess.</p><p>Still, she\u2019d been a happy bride. She\u2019d loved Dan, although in retrospect, she\u2019d known virtually nothing about either love or life. The hard realities would hit soon enough. In an effort to support his wife and child, Dan had enlisted in the army and been sent to Vietnam. The young man who\u2019d left her behind with their unborn child had been forever changed in the jungles of Southeast Asia. The man she\u2019d loved and married had never returned; a very different Dan Sherman had come home instead.</p><p>Her second wedding, of course, had been an elopement.</p><p>Their sudden marriage had upset everyone for one reason or another. Not surprisingly, perhaps, Olivia had been the most vocal. According to her, best friends should be informed of such plans, regardless of time or circumstances. Grace had come to regret not letting Olivia and her own family know until after the ceremony. Everyone now seemed convinced that Cliff and Grace needed to celebrate their marriage with family and friends in order to make it official\u2014at least in their eyes. Pastor Flemming had agreed to perform a short ceremony, which would be followed by the reception.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Cliff asked as he stepped into their bedroom. He was handsome in his tuxedo\u2014and completely miserable. He held his head at an unnatural angle and scowled in her direction. There were only the two of them in the house, since his daughter, Lisa, and her family had already left for the church hall. She planned to help Maryellen and Kelly finish decorating.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re going to a funeral,\u201d Grace told him truthfully.</p><p>That earned her a curt laugh. \u201cI hate these things,\u201d he muttered, twisting the black bow tie.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear it on my account,\u201d she assured him. \u201cActually, I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt came with the suit,\u201d Cliff muttered. \u201cI didn\u2019t think one of my string ties would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d She didn\u2019t want him to be uncomfortable; this day would be long enough as it was.</p><p>\u201cReally? You mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Grace kissed his cheek.</p><p>Raising his eyebrows, he eyed her in the pale pink suit. \u201cYou wearing panty hose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruth?\u201d Cliff knew her aversion to nylons, especially the control-top kind. \u201cI cheated.\u201d She lifted the skirt to reveal her thigh-high stockings.</p><p>Grinning, Cliff reached for the corner of his bow tie and pulled. The black silk instantly unfolded. He walked into their shared closet, and when he reappeared, he looked like a different man, relaxed and at ease. The bowtie had been replaced with an elegant black string tie and opal clasp, the perfect complement to his formal attire. Now he resembled the man she\u2019d married.</p><p>On the way to the church hall, Grace thought about mentioning a troubling conversation she\u2019d recently had with Olivia. Her friend had suggested that Will Jefferson might have the audacity to show up uninvited.</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t want to believe that Will would crash their wedding reception, but she was afraid acknowledging it would only cause more trouble, so she kept the information to herself.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with Olivia,\u201d she said abruptly as Cliff helped her into the car.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Cliff asked, giving her an odd look.</p><p>Grace hadn\u2019t intended to blurt it out. This feeling, this intuition, had hovered in her consciousness for the last couple of weeks, but Grace had tried to ignore it while she prepared for the reception.</p><p>At first she\u2019d assumed that whatever it was had to do with Will. Now she wasn\u2019t so sure. Olivia and Grace hadn\u2019t met for aerobics class for the past two Wednesdays, which was completely unlike Olivia. Grace would willingly have skipped the workout and gone straight for the coconut cream pie. Not Olivia. Her friend was a stickler about their exercise routine. If it hadn\u2019t been for Olivia, Grace would\u2019ve dropped it years ago. The fact that Olivia had cancelled two weeks in a row told Grace something was going on.</p><p>She should\u2019ve just asked.</p><p>This blasted reception was to blame. All her time and energy had gone into the arrangements for it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with Olivia?\u201d Cliff asked when he\u2019d joined her in the front seat.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Grace muttered, \u201cbut I intend to find out.\u201d She wasn\u2019t leaving the reception until she did.</p><p>The private ceremony with Pastor Flemming took place at the church an hour before the reception, with immediate family and close friends in attendance. Maryellen and Kelly and their families were there, along with Lisa and hers. Olivia and Jack, Charlotte and Ben, Cal and a few other dear friends made up the rest of the gathering.</p><p>Grace studied Olivia, who served as her matron of honor, and couldn\u2019t see any obvious signs of distress. Jack, on the other hand, looked dreadful. The way he stayed close to Olivia\u2019s side was revealing, too.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Grace said as soon as the ceremony was completed and they had a moment alone. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes welled with tears and she shook her head. \u201cI will after all of this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Grace insisted, pushing her toward the church ladies\u2019 room and forcing her inside. \u201cI\u2019m your best friend. Tell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you married Cliff without letting me know,\u201d Olivia reminded her, pressing her index fingers under each eye to forestall the tears.</p><p>\u201cThis is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, I promise, but I\u2019d rather wait until the reception\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Grace agreed. It must be bad since Olivia was almost in tears. Grace had no idea how she\u2019d get through this afternoon without knowing. If time had allowed, she would\u2019ve made Olivia tell her right then, but her guests had already started to arrive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The church hall had been beautifully decorated, thanks to their daughters, who\u2019d worked feverishly that morning. Soon it was overflowing with guests, all offering their best wishes. Cliff and Grace made sure they greeted everyone personally. Grace considered it the supreme compliment that so many people had chosen to share this special afternoon with her and Cliff.</p><p>They made the ceremonial first cut of the cake and fed each other a bite, to the applause and laughter of their guests.</p><p>The girls were cutting the cake and distributing slices when Grace noticed that Olivia, who stood at her side, had stiffened.</p><p>Sure enough, just as she\u2019d feared, Will Jefferson hovered just inside the door to the church hall, near Cal and Vicki\u2019s table. Grace felt her heart constrict. This was exactly what she hadn\u2019t wanted, exactly what she\u2019d prayed wouldn\u2019t happen.</p> <p>Olivia frowned. \u201cLet me take care of this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Grace put another slice of cake on a plate and, carrying it, went to search for her husband. Her stomach was in knots. Under no circumstances did she want Cliff to think she\u2019d invited Will to the reception.</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t the only one concerned about Will\u2019s presence. As soon as Charlotte saw her son, she hurried across the hall and stood directly in front of him, hands on her hips. Although Grace couldn\u2019t hear what was being said, Charlotte\u2019s body language clearly showed that she wasn\u2019t pleased.</p><p>Grace approached Cliff seconds after Charlotte had reached Will.</p><p>As she watched, standing beside her husband, Will nodded, looking across the room at Cliff.</p> <p>\u201cAt the risk of stating the obvious, Will Jefferson\u2019s here,\u201d Grace said. \u201cBefore you ask, I didn\u2019t invite him.\u201d</p><p>Cliff slid his arm around her waist. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d She blinked in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI ran into him at Maryellen\u2019s earlier in the week and the two of us had a chat. He apologized, and so did I.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s mouth sagged open. \u201cBut...you didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>Cliff rubbed his jaw. \u201cActually, I forgot.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou know what they say about keeping your friends close and your enemies closer. At any rate, he acted decent enough. You don\u2019t mind that I invited him, do you?\u201d</p> <p>It didn\u2019t matter whether she did or didn\u2019t. Will had shown up for the reception. At her husband\u2019s request...</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Cliff said, taking her hand. Before they moved from the vicinity of the table, he grabbed the slice of cake she still held.</p><p>They held hands as they made their way to the table where Charlotte sat with Ben and now Will.</p><p>\u201cHello, Will,\u201d Cliff greeted him. He set the piece of wedding cake in front of him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Charlotte inserted. \u201cIt\u2019s always been my understanding that only those invited to a party should attend. A lot has changed over the years, but I didn\u2019t realize manners had gone out the window with everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I explained, Mother, I was invited,\u201d Will said, glancing at Cliff with a wry expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Charlotte. I asked Will if he\u2019d come today.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte looked taken aback. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p> <p>Lingering nearby, Olivia caught Grace\u2019s eye; she raised one shoulder, indicating she hadn\u2019t known anything about this.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Cliff said, extending his hand. \u201cGrace and I are grateful you could join us. Stay as long as you like, and by all means have a piece of wedding cake.\u201d</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t speak. Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><p>Two hours later, most of the guests had departed. The money tree for the animal shelter dipped under the weight of the attached bills. Grace sent her daughters home with their husbands and children, while Olivia and Jack stayed, helping with the final cleanup. Lisa and her husband took their restless little girl for a walk. April wanted to feed gulls by the waterfront, so Lisa gathered some scraps of bread in a cloth napkin.</p><p>While Grace collected the wedding cards on the table, Olivia unclipped the bills from the money tree and inserted them in an envelope. She and Cliff had requested donations for the shelter, a cause they both supported, in lieu of gifts.</p><p>Without Grace\u2019s prompting, Olivia released a shaky breath and announced, \u201cMy mammogram showed something...suspicious.\u201d</p><p>Grace froze.</p><p>\u201cI went in for a second set of tests last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe results?\u201d she asked, instinctively fearing what her friend was about to tell her.</p><p>\u201cI have an appointment Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, Olivia.\u201d Grace was devastated for Olivia and heartbroken that she\u2019d felt compelled to keep this to herself.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Olivia whispered, as if reading her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI made it impossible, didn\u2019t I?\u201d Guilt and self-contempt overwhelmed her. Caught up in her own life, in superficial concerns like a wedding reception, she hadn\u2019t been paying attention to Olivia.</p><p>\u201cNo...I didn\u2019t want to ruin your day.\u201d</p><p>Grace dropped the stack of cards and impulsively hugged her friend.</p><p>Olivia shuddered, clinging to her for a long moment before she stepped back.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go to the doctor with you?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cJack said he wanted to be there.\u201d She offered a brave smile. \u201cHe\u2019s been a wreck ever since I got the phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia inhaled slowly. \u201cThank you for not telling me that everything\u2019s going to be all right. I don\u2019t think I could deal with platitudes just now. I\u2019m frightened, and so is Jack. If anything, this scare has brought us closer together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let me know right away?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Justine and her brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said anything to the children. I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s any need to worry them until I have all the facts.\u201d</p><p>Grace understood.</p><p>It was after ten by the time Grace and Cliff returned from dropping Lisa and her family at an airport hotel, since they were catching an early-morning flight to Maryland.</p><p>Cal was already back at the ranch and had seen to the horses. During the ride to Olalla, which felt far longer than usual, Grace\u2019s head spun with Olivia\u2019s news. It was all she could think about.</p><p>When they pulled into the yard, Cliff leaned over and kissed her, murmuring, \u201cGlad to be home, Mrs. Harding?\u201d She nodded, and not until they\u2019d broken apart did she notice that Cal was standing outside the barn.</p><p>Cliff was out of the car right away, striding over to him, Grace trailing behind. If Cal was waiting for them, that meant some kind of problem.</p><p>\u201cWhen I got to the house I picked up the mail,\u201d Cal said, extending an envelope to Grace. \u201cI must\u2019ve taken this by mistake. I wouldn\u2019t have opened it otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said, glancing down at the envelope, which bore the rental agency\u2019s logo.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to read it right away,\u201d he cautioned.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Cliff wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Cal grimaced. \u201cApparently the check your renters gave them bounced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Cliff said. \u201cLast month\u2019s was returned too.\u201d</p><p>Grace sighed. This was more bad news she\u2019d rather not deal with. Letting those ne\u2019er-do-wells rent her home had been a big mistake, and she had no one to blame but herself.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>Teri pored over a new cookbook on Sunday afternoon, searching for a recipe that would entice Bobby to eat. His appetite hadn\u2019t been good since he\u2019d learned she was pregnant. Hers, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t have been better. Her morning\u2014or rather, afternoon\u2014sickness wasn\u2019t nearly as bad now; she only occasionally came down with a bout of queasiness. Bobby\u2019s appetite, however, had almost completely vanished.</p><p>Then, to complicate life even more, her husband had discovered the joys of televised marketing. If there was the slightest hint that a particular product might be appropriate for a baby, Bobby ordered it. They often received two and three shipments a day.</p><p>So far, Bobby had purchased three cribs, five bassinets and enough toys to fill a day care center. The last thing that was delivered, and it came in a huge truck, was an entire gym set. While she loved him for it, this had to stop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re reading a cookbook,\u201d Bobby said as he wandered into the kitchen.</p><p>She nodded without looking up. She\u2019d already put Post-It notes on several of the pages, designating recipes she\u2019d like to try. Although she hadn\u2019t made her final decision, she\u2019d started a grocery list. \u201cSome cookbooks are more entertaining than novels.\u201d</p><p>Bobby was supposed to chuckle or comment or something. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked next, pointing to the sheet of paper on the table.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a list of what I need to pick up at the grocery store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend James,\u201d her husband ordered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go.\u201d Teri braced herself for the discussion that would inevitably follow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Teri didn\u2019t want to bicker. In fact, she hated it when they argued. Bobby didn\u2019t understand that she was a social person and staying in the house, beautiful though it was, simply wasn\u2019t enough for her. She needed to see people, interact with others. All weekend she\u2019d done nothing but watch TV shows and DVDs. Oh, and she\u2019d reorganized her dresser drawers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you...\u201d Bobby hesitated. Pulling out a chair, he sat down beside her. \u201cI need to know you\u2019ll be safe. I\u2019ll come with you, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby, of course I\u2019ll be safe. And I know you hate going to the grocery store. This is Cedar Cove, not some huge, scary city, so nothing\u2019s going to happen to me. But if it makes you feel better, James can tag along.\u201d Although she doubted he\u2019d be much protection. Bobby, however, seemed to think his driver possessed skills that rivaled those of Agent 007. Still, if it brought him peace of mind, she was willing to put up with James trailing behind her.</p><p>His gaze held hers and after a moment, he gave her a half smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to invite Christie over. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you or for James?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cFor both of us. And I\u2019ll ask her to go to the store with me, too.\u201d She considered that a satisfactory compromise. James was clearly besotted with Christie, and Teri\u2019s sister...well, that had yet to be determined. Teri suspected her sister was attracted to him, only she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d make spaghetti.\u201d</p><p>Bobby looked pleased. \u201cThe kind with clams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever version you like best,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cClams.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time in more than a week that Bobby had shown any interest in a meal, which was a relief. When she phoned, Christie seemed glad to hear from her and promptly accepted her dinner invitation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going out grocery shopping. Want to come?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy not,\u201d Christie said.</p><p>An hour later, when James eased the limo into the apartment parking lot, Christie was already waiting outside. She allowed James to open her car door.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he greeted her formally.</p> <p>\u201cJames.\u201d She inclined her head in a regal nod.</p><p>This was progress, Teri mused. Christie didn\u2019t even sound sarcastic. It seemed to take her an inordinate amount of time to slip into the seat and when she did, she held a long-stemmed rose. The color of the flower matched the flush in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming with me,\u201d Teri told her. She made a point of not remarking on the flower.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>Teri noticed that Christie met James\u2019s gaze in the rearview mirror.</p> <p>\u201cJames,\u201d Teri said, sliding closer to her sister. \u201cChristie asked me an interesting question a little while ago. What do you do with your time when Bobby doesn\u2019t require a driver?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer immediately.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say if you\u2019d rather not,\u201d Teri assured him. She didn\u2019t want to embarrass James.</p><p>\u201cHe should account for his time,\u201d Christie said. \u201cHe\u2019s being paid for all those hours, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>James headed into traffic and, after another short pause, said, \u201cI read.\u201d</p><p>This was news to Teri, but she supposed it made sense.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you read?\u201d Christie asked.</p><p>\u201cEverything. Contemporary novels, classics, all kinds of non-fiction.\u201d</p><p>Teri was impressed by this and suspected her sister was, too.</p><p>When they got to the house, Christie helped Teri make dinner, amid much laughter and the occasional small confidence. Bobby came into the kitchen a few times to see what all the merriment was about; he even joined in once or twice.</p><p>Dinner was delicious\u2014and fun\u2014and although Teri had invited James, he\u2019d declined. When she and Christie had put away the leftovers and finished with the dishes, the phone rang. Call display indicated that it was Rachel. As she picked up the receiver, Teri saw her sister slip outside, probably for a cigarette.</p><p>Now that she was only working part-time, Teri missed seeing her best friend as often as she had before.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everything?\u201d Teri asked, concerned because Rachel hadn\u2019t seemed herself lately.</p><p>\u201cOh, fine. Everything\u2019s great.\u201d</p> <p>The bravado sounded false to Teri. She knew Rachel felt tense about the upcoming rally Nate had asked her to attend.</p><p>\u201cAnd Bruce?\u201d Teri pressed. She suspected that whatever was really bothering Rachel could be traced to her friendship with Bruce Peyton.</p><p>The question was met with silence. Then Rachel muttered, \u201cWhy are you asking me about Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so defensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not defensive!\u201d</p><p>Teri smiled to herself. \u201cYes, you are. In fact, anytime I mention his name, you clam right up. So what gives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, absolutely nothing,\u201d Rachel insisted. Then, in a sudden reversal, she added, \u201cI love Nate, you know. We\u2019ll be together this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Teri rolled her eyes. She\u2019d heard enough about that stupid fund-raising rally to have memorized every detail. \u201cI thought you and Bruce and Jolene were going to the Taco Shack tonight.\u201d Teri knew this because she\u2019d called to ask Rachel to join them all for dinner. Rachel had to turn her down; Bruce, it seemed, was treating her and his daughter to reward Jolene for being elected class secretary.</p><p>\u201cWe were at the Taco Shack.\u201d</p><p>Either Teri was reading too much into it or something had happened. She hadn\u2019t expected to hear from Rachel so soon. Normally, Rachel couldn\u2019t shut up about Jolene; she bragged about every achievement as if the twelve-year-old was her own daughter. Rachel\u2019s silence was highly unusual.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Teri prompted, convinced now that Rachel\u2019s odd behavior was somehow connected to Bruce.</p><p>\u201cAnd...we had a very nice dinner,\u201d Rachel murmured. \u201cAnd then something...happened after dinner.\u201d</p><p>Just as Teri had guessed. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me,\u201d she said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cIt was a fluke. Neither of us intended this and now...now I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s ruined everything.\u201d She gulped in a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do and I think Bruce feels the same way and it\u2019s so dumb and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d Teri said, stopping Rachel. \u201cStart at the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Rachel took another deep breath. \u201cJolene was asked to spend the night with a friend and decided she\u2019d rather do that. Bruce said okay, so the two of us went out to dinner by ourselves.\u201d There was a momentary silence. \u201cThat\u2019s no big deal, right?\u201d she asked imploringly.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe drove there in separate cars,\u201d Rachel continued. \u201cI had a few errands to run first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a good time? At dinner, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Rachel paused. \u201cWe always do. Bruce and I get along fine.\u201d She laughed, but Teri thought it sounded more like a sob. \u201cThe staff at the Taco Shack knows us because we\u2019ve been there so often and they have the impression we\u2019re married. It\u2019s kind of a joke, and Bruce and I play along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s...sweet,\u201d Teri said, although she didn\u2019t think sweet was the best word.</p><p>Rachel ignored the comment. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should have dinner with Bruce anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You have fun together. Nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing until tonight,\u201d Rachel said darkly.</p><p>Teri waited for Rachel to explain and a few seconds later, she did. \u201cAfter dinner, we walked into the parking lot. You know how it gets dark early in the evenings now. Well, I was heading toward my car and obviously didn\u2019t watch where I was going because I stumbled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Bruce caught me by the elbow and then...then\u2014\u201d she lowered her voice \u201c\u2014he kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so he kissed you,\u201d Teri said. \u201cDid you kiss him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but you\u2019ve kissed him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean we really kissed,\u201d Rachel elaborated. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t any peck on the lips or friendly little kiss. This was kissing like I\u2019ve never been kissed in my life. These were kisses I felt all the way down to my toenails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKisses plural?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-h.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Bruce was as shocked as I was. He kept looking at me and I looked back at him and then he apologized and I apologized and told him I missed Nate and that\u2019s why I responded to him the way I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you missed Nate?\u201d Surely Rachel didn\u2019t actually believe that?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she returned heatedly. \u201cI need to move to San Diego like Nate wants....\u201d</p><p>Teri resisted the urge to scream that leaving Cedar Cove would be a mistake. For some time now, Teri had sensed that Rachel\u2019s feelings for Bruce were more complex than either of them realized. The last person to discover this seemed to be Rachel.</p><p>\u201cThose stupid kisses are an embarrassment to us both. He\u2019s sorry it happened, and so am I. Now I\u2019m afraid everything\u2019s changed.\u201d She sounded miserable. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling, Teri. I\u2019m afraid it might never go back to the way it was between us and I don\u2019t know if I can stand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it time,\u201d Teri said gently. \u201cBruce needs to think this over and so do you. You\u2019ve both had a shock. You\u2019ll be seeing Nate soon, and then you\u2019ll figure out how you feel.\u201d</p><p>Rachel clearly wanted to believe it would be that easy. And for her friend\u2019s sake, Teri hoped it would.</p><p>When she hung up the phone, Teri went searching for her sister. She wasn\u2019t surprised to find Christie in the patio chair. James sat with her, and although the evening was cool, neither seemed to mind. The moon was full and the stars looked bright and cold in the cloudless sky. As soon as they saw Teri, James leaped to his feet.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay if I join you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Christie told her.</p><p>James pulled out her chair and Teri sat beside her sister. \u201cJames was just telling me about the book he\u2019s reading,\u201d Christie said.</p><p>He seemed ill-at-ease with her there and stood once again. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, ladies, I\u2019ll retire to my quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Teri said.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, James.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cChristie. Miss Teri.\u201d</p><p>As soon as James was out of earshot, Teri blurted out, \u201cChristie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him to drop the Miss nonsense.\u201d</p><p>Teri had asked him to do the same thing a dozen times, but he\u2019d never paid any attention. He seemed willing to listen to her sister, though.</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>Jack waited until Olivia had left the kitchen before he reached for the phone. Bob Beldon was his AA sponsor and if ever Jack had needed to talk, it was now. Good thing Bob was on speed dial, because the way his hand shook, Jack wasn\u2019t sure he could\u2019ve punched in the right numbers.</p><p>Peggy answered, announcing the name of their bed-and-breakfast, Thyme and Tide.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jack.\u201d</p><p>Peggy instantly knew something was wrong. \u201cBob\u2019s in the other room,\u201d she said without asking for details. \u201cI\u2019ll get him for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Half a minute later, Bob was on the phone. \u201cHey, Jack. It\u2019s Bob.\u201d</p><p>Jack felt as if his tongue had swelled to twice its size.</p><p>\u201cJack, are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he finally managed.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t at the meeting tonight.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned against the kitchen door. \u201cI should\u2019ve been. I need a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there alcohol anywhere near you?\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Bob to get straight to the point. \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d Olivia might have a bottle of cooking sherry somewhere in the kitchen, but if she did, he wasn\u2019t aware of it.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you meet me?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cTell me when and where.\u201d</p><p>Jack closed his eyes. He was terrified to leave the house\u2014it wasn\u2019t safe to go where there might be booze. Where he might pass a bar or a liquor store or even a grocery. Although he\u2019d been dry for over fifteen years, he felt weak. Desperate. He needed a drink. He didn\u2019t think he could get through this ordeal with Olivia if he couldn\u2019t have one. The craving was like a knife twisting in his gut. One drink. The aching need refused to go away. One drink would make everything better. Ignoring the voices in his head was becoming more difficult. Too difficult. The whispers urged him toward oblivion with a promise he knew was a lie. A drink wouldn\u2019t make anything better.</p><p>Still, it was how he\u2019d once smothered his pain, and he hungered for the oblivion, the escape. Fear of what might happen if he gave in was the only thing that held him back.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to come to you?\u201d Bob must\u2019ve read his thoughts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Even getting out that one word was an effort.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>Jack knew then and there that he couldn\u2019t have found a better sponsor\u2014and friend. He\u2019d linked up with Bob years earlier while living in Spokane and working for the big regional paper, The Review. When Bob and Peggy moved back to their hometown and opened Thyme and Tide, Jack had visited. He\u2019d fallen in love with the town, the landscape and the slower pace.</p><p>Up to that point, Jack had pretty much screwed up his life with alcohol, a bad marriage and a mangled relationship with his only son. Eric had moved to Seattle, and it seemed that if Jack was ever going to reconcile with him, his chances would improve if he lived in the area. So he\u2019d come to Cedar Cove, taken a job with the local paper and got himself a place to live.</p> <p>\u201cJack?\u201d Olivia\u2019s voice drifted out from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d he said, trying to pull himself together. Olivia had enough to worry about without him. Dragging in a deep breath, he went down the hallway to the master bedroom, determined to hide his fears. \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She sat up in bed, looking pale and lovely. Jack resisted the urge to hold her in his arms, to protect her and love her. She was frightened. How could she not be? He was scared out of his wits, too. If he lost Olivia, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d survive.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear you on the phone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t lie. He\u2019d rather she not know he\u2019d called his sponsor, but he wasn\u2019t going to lie about it. \u201cBob\u2019s coming by. I thought I\u2019d talk to him for a few minutes. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, go ahead.\u201d She\u2019d spent part of the evening with Grace and seemed fortified and optimistic afterward.</p><p>At the moment Jack could use a dose of that optimism. \u201cI\u2019ll probably be a couple of hours,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCan I turn out the light, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means. You need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Olivia gave him a tentative smile. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this, Jack. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He should be the one reassuring her, and he hated himself for being so weak. \u201cOf course we will.\u201d</p> <p>Jack walked over to her bedside, bent down and kissed her, then switched off the lamp. Fearing she might overhear the conversation between him and Bob, he closed the bedroom door.</p><p>Halfway down the hallway, he stopped and leaned against the wall, covering his face with both hands, remembering. Remembering. Eric, his son, had leukemia as a kid. That was what had driven Jack to alcohol in the first place. That helplessness, that total dependence on others to care for his son, that inability to alleviate his suffering...Jack had barely made it then, and he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d make it this time. Eric had gone into long-term remission, but Jack didn\u2019t know if he could watch someone else he loved endure all the pain and uncertainty. All the grief and fear.</p><p>He just couldn\u2019t do it. He just might have to.</p><p>Instead of using the doorbell, Bob knocked quietly at the front door. Jack hurried to let him in. When he saw his friend, it was all he could do not to break down. His weakness shamed and humiliated him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been repeating the Serenity Prayer for the last hour,\u201d Jack told him. \u201cI think I\u2019d be face-first in a bottle if I hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Bob nodded, and Jack was grateful that he understood. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had a drink?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cBy the grace of God, no.\u201d He was one sip away from a complete mental and physical breakdown. He couldn\u2019t explain why alcohol tempted him when he knew what it did to him. Still, the pull was as powerful as an undertow, and Jack could feel himself being swept away with the need.</p><p>He was hanging on by a thread and that thread was Bob.</p> <p>\u201cSit down and tell me what\u2019s happened.\u201d Bob led him to the sofa.</p><p>Jack slumped down, burying his face in his hands.</p><p>Bob pulled the ottoman closer and sat on it.</p><p>\u201cOlivia went in for a routine mammogram,\u201d Jack began, his voice faltering slightly.</p><p>\u201cCancer?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. Not for sure. The Women\u2019s Clinic called her back for a second test, a more extensive one, and then for an ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the doctor?\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cWe went this morning. He has to do a biopsy.\u201d</p><p>Bob exhaled loudly. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded again. \u201cI don\u2019t think I truly realized how much I love Olivia until this morning.\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, Bob smiled. \u201cOlivia said almost those same words to me when you had your heart attack.\u201d</p><p>Now that their situations were, in effect, reversed, he could appreciate how hard it had been on his wife. The problem was, love opened you up to that kind of pain. He\u2019d never expected to fall in love again when he moved to Cedar Cove. Even less had he expected to find someone who loved him.</p><p>He\u2019d been attracted to Olivia right away. Sitting in her courtroom and watching her deny a divorce\u2014that got his attention. Most family court judges were jaded by the day-in-and-day-out bitterness of marriages gone bad. Not Olivia. She\u2019d seen that the young couple was still in love and she\u2019d intervened. Her compassion had stirred him. Her toughness had impressed him.</p><p>Jack knew that if Olivia hadn\u2019t denied that divorce, the couple would have gone their separate ways and carried around that pain for the rest of their lives. She\u2019d forced them to deal with the grief of losing their child, forced them to resolve their differences.</p><p>Without knowing it, Jack had fallen in love with her that very morning. In fact, he\u2019d written an entire column in the Cedar Cove Chronicle about her unusual stand. His attention had embarrassed her but she\u2019d eventually forgiven him.</p><p>When they got married, Jack felt as though his life had begun again. He was crazy about her, although their relationship had never been easy. They were about as different as two people could get.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>Startled, Jack glanced up to see Bob staring at him. \u201cYou won\u2019t know for sure if it\u2019s cancer until they do the biopsy, right?\u201d</p><p>His heart pounded against his ribs. \u201cIt\u2019s scheduled for this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a drink now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cA strong drink. Strong enough to take away this ache.\u201d Preferably hard alcohol, Scotch or brandy, something that would melt his teeth.</p><p>\u201cA drink\u2019s going to help?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>They both knew the answer to that. \u201cNo. But that doesn\u2019t make me want one any less.\u201d</p><p>Bob cocked his eyebrow. \u201cOne?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t have to be told that one drink, even one sip, was a fantasy. For alcoholics like Bob and him, it never ended there. Jack had sat through enough meetings to know that. Lived it long enough to recognize the truth when he heard it. This was the lie so many alcoholics tried to believe: that they were strong enough to have one drink, just one, and then walk away. But that wasn\u2019t how it worked for people like him.</p><p>\u201cYou need a meeting to get your head on straight,\u201d Bob said. He stood up to take his wallet out of his hip pocket, then pulled out a small booklet and unfolded it. \u201cThere\u2019s one in Bremerton that starts in ten minutes. I\u2019ll drive.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. They\u2019d be late but that didn\u2019t matter. A meeting was a meeting. He\u2019d feel better after talking about this with other men and women who understood the addictive power of alcohol.</p><p>\u201cLet me say goodbye to Olivia.\u201d Carefully opening the bedroom door a moment later, he paused, hesitant to wake her if she was asleep. Light spilled from the hallway into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Olivia rose up on one elbow. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is now. Bob and I are going out for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be okay by yourself?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can call Grace if you want.\u201d She was the kind of friend to Olivia that Bob was to him. Any time of the day or night, Grace would be willing to help.</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Walking into the room, Jack sat on the edge of the bed and gathered Olivia in his arms. As they clung to each other, he felt her tremble.</p><p>\u201cI need a meeting,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know, Jack. Go.\u201d She stroked the back of his head, her fingers light against his hair.</p><p>It was the same way she touched him after they\u2019d made love. The gesture brought emotion bubbling to the surface and Jack hid his face in her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWake me when you get back,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He left her then, reluctantly.</p><p>Bob was waiting for him by the front door. Jack grabbed a fleece jacket from the hall closet and together they headed into the cold. A sporadic rain had begun, matching his mood, darkening an already dark sky. When they reached the address, they hurried into a church basement that smelled of stale coffee and damp coats. Jack was quickly immersed in the familiar and comforting routine of the meeting; it was exactly what he\u2019d needed, he told himself an hour later.</p><p>During his first weeks of sobriety, he\u2019d gone to thirty meetings in thirty days. He\u2019d needed every one of those meetings. That was how he\u2019d made it through the first month\u2014one day at a time and on some days one minute at a time. Alcoholics Anonymous had given him a structure. And Bob had helped him at every step, listening, encouraging, cutting through the bull and self-pity. When his head was clear enough to listen, Bob reminded him that no one had poured the booze down his throat. No one had forced him to drink. He had to take responsibility for his own life, his own happiness.</p><p>By the time he let himself into the house, it was two o\u2019clock. He, Bob and a couple of other people from the meeting had gone out for coffee afterward and they\u2019d talked for another hour. Jack felt almost sane again.</p><p>He slipped off his jacket and hung it in the hall closet. Olivia had trained him well, he thought. Smiling, he started toward the bedroom. When he walked inside, he was surprised to see his wife sitting up in bed, a book lying open on her lap. She blinked at him, obviously a bit disoriented.</p><p>\u201cOh! I didn\u2019t hear you come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d Moving to the side of the bed, he kissed her. He\u2019d meant it to be light and easy, but the kiss quickly turned into something more, something urgent.</p><p>All at once, Olivia broke away from him. \u201cJack Griffin,\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat\u2019s that I taste on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>She ran her tongue over her bottom lip. \u201cCherry pie?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Miss Coconut-Cream-Pie-every-Wednesday-night. You\u2019ve got no call to be criticizing me.\u201d</p><p>Her pretend outrage faded, and she set aside the book she\u2019d been reading. \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Jack knew he was ready for whatever the future held. He could\u2014and would\u2014be the man his wife deserved.</p><p>Thirty-Two</p><p>Rachel checked her watch, then peered out the living-room window again. Bruce was already five minutes late, and she wondered if he even remembered that he\u2019d agreed to drive her to the airport today. She\u2019d asked him weeks ago\u2014long before he\u2019d kissed her...before the less-than-subtle shift in their relationship. They hadn\u2019t talked since that night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Normally she\u2019d phone to remind him. She hadn\u2019t, mainly because she didn\u2019t know what to say. It was all so awkward. He obviously regretted those kisses as much as she did. Every time she thought about the way she\u2019d responded to him, she got upset. They\u2019d both been out of line, and her biggest fear was that this momentary slip might have ruined one of the most agreeable friendships of her life.</p><p>When Bruce\u2019s car pulled up to the curb, Rachel wasn\u2019t sure whether to be relieved or not. Reaching for her suitcase, she hurried outside, pausing only long enough to lock the door. According to the Pittsburgh forecast, which she\u2019d looked up on the Internet, the weather there was unseasonably cold for mid-October. She\u2019d brought along her winter coat, slung over her arm because she certainly didn\u2019t need it in Cedar Cove right now. The Pacific Northwest enjoyed moderate temperatures, although it was uncomfortably cool at night.</p><p>Without a word of greeting, Bruce was out of the car. He took the suitcase from her hand and heaved it into the trunk. She noticed that his eyes avoided hers.</p><p>Rachel felt wretched. If they were going to remain friends, they needed to clear the air. She waited until she was inside the car and had fastened her seat belt.</p> <p>\u201cI really appreciate your doing this,\u201d she said, thinking that showing her gratitude was a good start.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d His response was clipped, as if he\u2019d rather not talk to her at all. Driving into Seattle during the morning rush hour wasn\u2019t a negligible task; Bruce was doing her a huge favor. But he\u2019d volunteered as soon as she\u2019d mentioned it. He had his own business, so he could take the time off.</p><p>As they neared the freeway on-ramp she finally referred to that foolish kiss. \u201cI guess maybe we should talk about what happened Friday night,\u201d she said, fiddling nervously with the strap of her handbag.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d Bruce returned, focusing his attention on the road ahead.</p><p>\u201cI want to be sure it hasn\u2019t damaged our friendship.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you regret the whole thing. So do I,\u201d she continued.</p><p>He turned his head briefly, glancing in her direction. \u201cI never said I regretted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou apologized,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as regretting it.\u201d</p><p>Rachel frowned, a little confused. \u201cOh. I guess not.\u201d She didn\u2019t really see the difference, but that didn\u2019t matter. \u201cOur friendship means a great deal to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd me. You\u2019ve been wonderful with Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than Jolene, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>A familiar ache came over Rachel. She loved Jolene, and she cared about Bruce. More than cared about him? Everything was suddenly too complicated. She grew quiet after his remark, and Bruce didn\u2019t seem inclined to speak, either.</p><p>When they arrived at Sea-TacAirport, he stopped at the curb. The sidewalk in front of the terminal was swarming with people. Bruce left the engine running as he hopped out of the car and retrieved her suitcase from the trunk. He\u2019d set it on the curb before Rachel had a chance to gather the rest of her things and climb out.</p><p>Apparently he couldn\u2019t get rid of her fast enough. They stood there awkwardly, facing each other in the midst of people coming and going, dropping off travelers, unloading bags. He seemed every bit as nervous as she was.</p><p>\u201cHave a good flight,\u201d Bruce finally murmured.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m sure I will.\u201d Within hours, she\u2019d be seeing Nate again and she should be feeling elated. Excited. Only she wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d rather sort this out with Bruce. Or at least effect some kind of reconciliation before she left. She hated this unsettled feeling. Still, she\u2019d tried, and he didn\u2019t seem interested. And Rachel didn\u2019t feel she could press any more than she already had.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t right to be flying off to visit Nate and his family while she was thinking about another man. This would be an important week. The political fundraiser the next afternoon was critical to Nate\u2019s family, and Rachel was determined to do everything she could to become an asset to both Nate and his father.</p><p>Then, surprising her again, Bruce stepped closer and hugged her. This wasn\u2019t a token hug; he held her tight, as if he didn\u2019t want to let her go. After a moment, he dropped his arms. Shocked, and more confused than ever, Rachel moved toward her suitcase and without looking back, picked it up and walked into the terminal.</p><p>Nate had arranged his flight into Pittsburgh so that he\u2019d arrive from San Diego thirty minutes ahead of her. When she came out of the jetway, he was at the gate waiting for her.</p><p>One glance at her handsome navy man, and Rachel gave a small cry of delight. She flew into his arms. It felt like forever since they\u2019d been together, although it had only been a month.</p><p>\u201cDad sent a car for us,\u201d Nate said as he slipped an arm around her waist. He gazed down at her, his eyes full of warmth. \u201cYou look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Rachel couldn\u2019t keep from blushing at his praise. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a dinner this evening that Mom suggested we attend. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d</p><p>Rachel did mind, but she couldn\u2019t protest, since Nate\u2019s family had paid for her airline ticket. She\u2019d hoped she and Nate would have this evening to themselves. That obviously wouldn\u2019t be the case.</p><p>The driver found them in the baggage claim area, and soon they were on their way. As Nate relayed the itinerary for the next two days, it seemed unlikely that they\u2019d have more than a minute to themselves at any given time. The culminating event, the rally, was where Nate\u2019s father would announce that he\u2019d be running for the senate.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she said at one point. \u201cMy head is spinning. Are we required to attend all these functions?\u201d In addition to the rally, there were a number of meals and cocktail parties, sometimes as many as three in a single afternoon. There were also visits to service clubs, senior citizens\u2019 organizations, schools and even a shopping mall, where they\u2019d hand out flyers.</p><p>Nate seemed surprised that she\u2019d asked. \u201cOf course we\u2019re going to all of them. That\u2019s what you do during a political campaign. Trust me, I should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you always this involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the last few years, yes.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cI should tell you that Dad and I\u2019ve been talking.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t know if that was a good thing or not, although of his parents, she preferred his father. Nathaniel Olsen was a consummate politician and had a way of making everyone he met feel like his best friend. Still, as much as she hoped the congressman approved of her relationship with Nate, Rachel couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Nate\u2019s mother, on the other hand, hadn\u2019t bothered to disguise her objections. This time Rachel was prepared for that. No matter what Patrice said or did, she refused to let the other woman upset her.</p><p>\u201cDad wants me to work for him when I get out of the navy,\u201d Nate said. He clearly thought she\u2019d be pleased.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t; it was exactly what she\u2019d always feared. When they\u2019d first met, Nate claimed he had no political aspirations of his own. She was beginning to seriously doubt that. Nate loved campaigning, loved the challenge and the excitement. He was used to privilege and to the advantages conferred by wealth and power. Wherever they went, as long as he was with his father, he was a guest of honor.</p><p>\u201cI thought you hadn\u2019t made a decision about reenlisting in the navy?\u201d They\u2019d discussed this a number of times.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d Nate was quick to tell her.</p><p>His flippant response gave her the distinct feeling that he actually had.</p><p>The driver delivered them to the Olsen residence outside the city. The huge, two-story house seemed more like a palace to Rachel; it was even grander than she\u2019d expected. There were fifteen acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, and the house itself looked as if it belonged in a glossy architectural magazine.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Nate said, taking her hand.</p><p>Rachel managed to close her mouth and gulp in a deep breath before Patrice Olsen, Nate\u2019s mother, came hurrying out the front door, arms wide. Nate released Rachel\u2019s hand long enough to hug his mother, lifting Patrice off the ground in his exuberance.</p><p>Inside the Olsen residence, everything seemed to be made of Italian marble or polished mahogany, and every piece of furniture looked like a priceless antique. Rachel was afraid to touch any surface for fear of smudging it, afraid to walk anywhere for fear of leaving footprints in the deep, soft carpeting.</p><p>She\u2019d been escorted to a guest room that felt more like a hotel room, but far nicer than any she\u2019d ever stayed at. Dinner was just an hour after their arrival so Rachel didn\u2019t have time to do more than admire her room, change her clothes and freshen her makeup before they had to leave.</p><p>The next morning, there was a breakfast at which Nate and Rachel were required to mingle. With Nate at her side, she found it wasn\u2019t as difficult as she\u2019d assumed. Afterward he complimented her, and that went a long way toward soothing her nerves.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing really well,\u201d he assured her as they hurried from the breakfast to a factory and then a huge assisted-living complex. Naturally, the local press showed up everywhere. Rachel prayed no one would address any questions to her or ask about her role.</p><p>She marveled at both Nate and his father. At each stop, each occasion, she saw how effectively they spoke, how inspiring they were. The rally the next afternoon was the main event, followed by a formal dinner.</p><p>Saturday was another long day of appearances until finally they entered the auditorium where the rally would be held. Rachel sat with rapt attention through all the speeches and applauded at all the appropriate places. At the end of Nathaniel\u2019s speech, during which he declared his candidacy, she joined the crowd in giving him a standing ovation.</p><p>When the applause died down, the congressman brought Nate onto the stage and introduced him, telling his constituents how proud he was to have a son serving in the military. With tears in her eyes, Rachel clapped wildly.</p><p>To the sound of cheering, Nate stood next to his father and raised both arms. Then father and son embraced in what was truly a touching moment.</p><p>Patrice Olsen moved down one seat in order to sit beside Rachel.</p><p>\u201cHe looks good with his father, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d she said, leaning close.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Rachel smiled over at Nate\u2019s mother and continued applauding.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel has political ambitions for our son.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had already assumed as much. \u201cI can see he\u2019d do a wonderful job.\u201d After watching Nate with his father, it seemed inevitable that he\u2019d follow in the older man\u2019s footsteps.</p><p>\u201cNate gets out of the navy in less than a year.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. She and Nate had discussed that very subject shortly after she\u2019d landed in Pittsburgh. Until that point, Rachel had been under the misconception that he hadn\u2019t decided whether or not to re-enlist. She\u2019d guessed then that Nate wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>\u201cDirk Hagerman is a friend of Nathaniel\u2019s. Dirk\u2019s retiring as a state representative, and they\u2019ve been talking about getting him to endorse Nate as a candidate for his seat. Nate\u2019s military background and the fact that he went in as an enlisted man\u2014it all bodes well. We have every belief that he could win his first time out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rachel\u2019s heart took a direct hit. \u201cIs...is that what Nate wants?\u201d</p><p>Patrice eyed her coolly. \u201cLook at him up there with his father, Rachel. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Rachel couldn\u2019t deny it. Never had she seen Nate more in his element; like his father, he was a natural politician.</p><p>\u201cHe was born for this,\u201d Patrice said.</p> <p>Rachel couldn\u2019t deny that, either. She half expected Patrice to point out her flaws, her inadequacies as the potential wife of a politician. Rachel bristled, waiting for some dig or slight, but to her surprise Nate\u2019s mother said nothing else. What Rachel discovered was that Patrice\u2019s silence was more reproachful, more uncomfortable, than anything she might have said.</p><p>Rachel had been riddled with doubts before. She\u2019d given this weekend everything she had. Nate had been with her almost every minute and while living in the public eye certainly wasn\u2019t her forte, it wasn\u2019t as bad as she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Early on Sunday, Nate and Rachel left for the airport together. Both his parents hugged her farewell and repeatedly thanked her for being part of this important event.</p><p>Because their flights were going to different cities, she and Nate went their separate ways at the airport. Rachel\u2019s one regret was that they\u2019d had practically no time alone.</p><p>Nate kissed her as they prepared to go to their departure gates. \u201cYou were terrific,\u201d he said, smiling down on her. \u201cAbsolutely terrific.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much I missed all of this,\u201d Nate confessed. \u201cBeing with the constituents who support our position is invigorating.\u201d</p><p>Rachel murmured her agreement.</p><p>They talked for a few more minutes and kissed again. By the time she made it to her gate, the flight had already started to board. Settling back with a couple of new magazines, Rachel took a deep breath and tried to relax.</p><p>After spending these days with Nate, she was more certain than ever that he\u2019d enter politics. He hadn\u2019t told her of his decision, though, and now she understood why. He\u2019d wanted to see how this visit went. It wasn\u2019t a comforting thought.</p><p>On her arrival in Seattle hours later, Rachel found Bruce and Jolene waiting for her in baggage claim. The second Jolene saw her she skipped over to Rachel\u2019s side.</p> <p>\u201cRachel!\u201d she cried as if they hadn\u2019t seen each other in years.</p><p>Rachel hugged her, twirling her around, although Jolene was almost too big for that now. Hard to believe she\u2019d be in junior high next September.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Bruce said, hands in his pockets. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally well.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem happy to hear it. If anything, he looked irritated and out of sorts. Rachel wanted to confront him, ask what was wrong, but Jolene acted like a playful puppy, demanding attention as they walked toward the parking garage, making serious conversation impossible.</p><p>\u201cSo how was Lover Boy?\u201d Bruce asked as he set her bag in the car trunk.</p><p>Rachel glared at him. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t call him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSailor Man, then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has a name, you know,\u201d she said sharply.</p><p>\u201cAll right, how\u2019s Nate?\u201d Bruce opened the passenger door for her.</p><p>\u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go out to eat?\u201d Jolene asked, clambering into the backseat and searching for her seat belt. \u201cI want to hear about the rally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going out to eat.\u201d</p><p>A little shocked by the vehemence of his response, Rachel turned around and looked at his daughter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been in a bad mood all day,\u201d the girl told her.</p><p>\u201cI have not,\u201d Bruce barked. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you have homework to finish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>Rachel snapped her own seat belt into place. \u201cWe\u2019ll go out another time, okay?\u201d she suggested in an effort to keep the peace.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jolene said, easily mollified.</p><p>Judging by his dark, brooding expression, Bruce had no interest in spending time with Rachel. After those kisses, this was precisely what she\u2019d been afraid of.</p><p>The drive back to Cedar Cove seemed to take twice as long as usual. Rachel managed to carry on a somewhat disjointed conversation with Jolene, mostly about sixth-grade gossip, who liked whom and so forth. Bruce ignored them both. When he pulled up in front of her house, he stomped out of the car to remove her suitcase from the trunk.</p><p>\u201cSee you soon,\u201d Rachel promised Jolene.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Bruce had already dropped her suitcase on the front step and started back toward the car, head down, his gaze averted.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the ride,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Bruce mumbled as he stepped past her. Her key was barely in the lock when he roared away.</p><p>Thirty-Three</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t stop worrying about Olivia and the upcoming biopsy results.</p><p>Her friend minimized her fears, but Grace wasn\u2019t fooled. Olivia was afraid. Jack, too. The biopsy had been done and the lab required two days to do an analysis. This was the second day.</p><p>Just as she was about to go for lunch, the phone on her desk rang. \u201cGrace Harding,\u201d she answered. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace.\u201d</p><p>It was Olivia, and she didn\u2019t need to say another word. The tone of her voice said it all. Cancer. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAt home. I didn\u2019t go the courthouse today.\u201d She paused. \u201cMy doctor called a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, don\u2019t move, I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Grace forgot about lunch. Her appetite had vanished the second she heard Olivia\u2019s voice. For two days she\u2019d eaten practically nothing; all she could think about was her best friend and what she might be facing. \u201cI\u2019m leaving right now.\u201d</p><p>Grace arranged to take the rest of the day off, then rushed out the door, almost forgetting her coat and purse. She was outside before she\u2019d even slipped her arms into the sleeves.</p><p>Thankfully, the drive down Lighthouse Road</p><p>was just long enough to allow Grace to gather her thoughts. When she arrived, Olivia was standing on the porch waiting for her. Wearing only a sweater, she seemed thin and frail, buffeted by the cold autumn wind. Her arms were wrapped around her middle and her face was set in that determined expression Grace knew so well. It was the same look she\u2019d worn the afternoon she announced that Stan, her ex-husband, had decided to move out. The look that said life was hard but you couldn\u2019t give up\u2014that you had to be equal to the pain and the grief.</p><p>The sight of Olivia, her lifelong friend, standing alone brought stinging tears to Grace\u2019s eyes. Everything started to blur as she pulled the car to the side of the road and parked carelessly.</p><p>The wind whipped her coat around her as she got out. Dashing the tears from her cheeks, she didn\u2019t bother to hide the fact that she was crying. She rushed up the sidewalk and to the porch steps where Olivia stood. She stopped abruptly. They hugged, and the tears in her friend\u2019s eyes brought a sob to her own throat.</p><p>\u201cTell me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cancer.\u201d</p><p>Grace tried not to cry. Crying wouldn\u2019t help Olivia. \u201cHow...how bad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what stage it is yet. I have an appointment with the surgeon next week. We\u2019ll find out more then.\u201d</p><p>Grace swallowed in an effort to control her emotions. Fear sent a chill down her spine. Her friend, her dearest friend, had cancer.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d Olivia whispered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>Through the years, Grace had seen Olivia face every tragedy with grit and faith. When Jordan died it was Olivia who held the family together. A few months later, when Stan moved out, she\u2019d dealt with that, too. Never once, through all the grief, had Olivia ever admitted she was afraid.</p><p>It took a diagnosis of cancer to do that.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have tea,\u201d Grace said and, with her arm around Olivia\u2019s waist, led her back into the house.</p><p>While Grace put the kettle on, Olivia sat at the kitchen table looking like a child, lost and lonely in her own home.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d Grace asked, wondering why he wasn\u2019t here when Olivia needed him so badly.</p><p>\u201cHe...he didn\u2019t take the news well,\u201d Olivia murmured. \u201cI suggested he go and talk to Bob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have left you.\u201d Grace bit back her anger at Jack, knowing it was really anger at the unfairness of life.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI told him you were coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Olivia whispered and a tear slipped down the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone else know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Grace understood. Olivia needed to find her own balance, to consider her own future, before she told her mother or her children.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d Grace promised.</p><p>The hint of a smile came to Olivia then. \u201cI knew I could count on you.\u201d She stretched out her arm and they clasped hands.</p><p>Olivia had been with Grace when Dan disappeared, and later, too, when her husband\u2019s body was discovered and finally laid to rest. They were friends, would always be friends, no matter what the future held. For nearly all their lives, they\u2019d shared their secrets, their hurts, their triumphs and joys.</p><p>\u201cThe part I have a hard time accepting,\u201d Olivia said after sipping her hot tea, \u201cis that there\u2019s an invader inside my body. A disease that wants to steal my life away. I keep thinking about it.\u201d She placed one hand over her heart. \u201cThe enemy is inside me,\u201d she repeated. \u201cIn the past I\u2019ve had to deal with forces outside me. What I\u2019m confronting now is in here.\u201d Her hand formed a fist and she closed her eyes.</p><p>Grace bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could explain it better,\u201d she said. \u201cWith everything else, I could close a door and retreat. Take a break from it, you know? I can\u2019t with cancer. There\u2019s no escaping my own body.\u201d</p><p>Grace merely nodded, having no comfort to offer except her presence.</p><p>She spent an hour with Olivia, and they drank two pots of tea before Jack returned. Whatever his problem had been earlier, apparently it was now resolved. He seemed confident and matter-of-fact, answering Grace\u2019s questions quickly and clearly.</p><p>Olivia went to lie down, and Grace was grateful for the opportunity to speak to him privately.</p><p>\u201cCall me anytime, night or day,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cIf you and Olivia need anything, call me.\u201d</p><p>He agreed. After a brief silence, he spoke again. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you, I wasn\u2019t prepared for what this would do to me,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI thought I was. You might remember that my son had cancer years ago, and I assumed I knew what it\u2019d be like to hear that verdict a second time. I wasn\u2019t even close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia\u2019s a strong woman.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes took on a resolute look. \u201cOlivia needs a strong husband who\u2019ll stand at her side while she\u2019s going through this. I\u2019m here and I intend to stay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace left soon after, first hugging him goodbye. He thanked her over and over for coming to the house, for giving them her support, for being Olivia\u2019s friend.</p><p>When she got home, Grace immediately went looking for Cliff. She found him talking to Cal in the barn, but he broke off whatever he was saying as soon as he caught sight of her.</p><p>\u201cI saw Olivia,\u201d she rushed to tell him, fresh tears filling her eyes.</p><p>Cliff put his arm around her shoulders and they walked slowly back to the house. Once inside, she turned to him. \u201cIt\u2019s cancer,\u201d she said starkly.</p> <p>He nodded grimly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the prognosis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until she sees the surgeon, and that won\u2019t be until next week. We\u2019ll find out more then.\u201d Grace paused for a moment, her voice threatening to break. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t told Charlotte or her children.\u201d</p><p>Cliff urged her to sit down at the table and began preparing tea. Grace smiled, thanking him, and didn\u2019t say that one more cup of tea was probably the last thing she needed.</p><p>She saw the envelope with the returned rent check on the table and sighed. Another concern to deal with, another problem to solve. It felt trivial compared to what Olivia was going through, but still...</p><p>Cliff glanced at the envelope, too. \u201cOh, I talked to Judy this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Grace knew the rental agent couldn\u2019t be blamed. She herself had insisted Judy accept the Smiths as tenants despite their unsatisfactory references.</p><p>\u201cApparently, this isn\u2019t the first time these people have done this.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t come as any surprise to Grace.</p><p>\u201cJudy talked to another agent from the Bremerton area,\u201d Cliff continued. \u201cShe learned that this couple\u2019s made quite the habit of bilking their landlords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould Judy tell you how long it would take to evict them?\u201d</p><p>Cliff frowned. \u201cPeople like this know how to work the system. She said it might take six months to get them out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSix months!\u201d Grace cried. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hopeless. They\u2019ll exploit their rights as tenants and drag everything out until the bitter end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an outrage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now there isn\u2019t anything we can do,\u201d Cliff said, \u201cexcept file eviction papers and play this out.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, letting her head fall to the table.</p><p>He reached into a high cupboard and brought out a half-full bottle of bourbon. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing we can do\u2014substitute strong drink for weak tea.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Grace smiled.</p><p>Thirty-Four</p> <p>Teri could tell that something was bothering Rachel. The salon was humming with activity the way it always did on Fridays. But, busy or not, the two of them usually managed to arrange their schedules so they could have lunch together. At noon, Rachel claimed she simply wasn\u2019t hungry.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re not hungry?\u201d Teri demanded. \u201cWhatever\u2019s bothering you must be big. Nothing takes away your appetite.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t even smile.</p><p>In spite of Teri\u2019s efforts to get her to talk about her trip to Pittsburgh, Rachel had barely said a word. For that matter, she hadn\u2019t mentioned Jolene or Bruce, either, which was highly unusual.</p><p>If Teri had her guess, what distressed her friend was her ongoing confusion about Nate and Bruce. Nate hadn\u2019t made any secret of his intentions. And then there was Bruce.</p><p>Teri wanted to shake that man and tell him to take action, do something before he lost Rachel for good. If he did, it would be his own stupid fault. As for Rachel...Teri didn\u2019t know what to think. She didn\u2019t doubt that Rachel loved Nate, but\u2014in Teri\u2019s opinion\u2014she loved Bruce more.</p><p>A few weeks ago, when Rachel phoned, rattled because Bruce had kissed her, she\u2019d made it sound as though that was the first time it\u2019d ever happened. News flash: Bruce had kissed her long before that night.</p><p>Although this last kiss\u2014maybe there\u2019d been more to it. Rachel had obviously been shocked. So, it appeared, was Bruce.</p><p>The only time she\u2019d mentioned him was to tell Teri how angry he\u2019d been when he picked her up from the airport. According to Rachel, he couldn\u2019t dump her on her doorstep quickly enough.</p><p>At four, Teri had a perm, and because she was too busy watching Rachel and worrying about her, she got behind schedule. When James showed up at five-fifteen to drive her home, she had another half-hour left.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait,\u201d James, the soul of patience, assured her. He glanced nervously around the salon. \u201cPerhaps it would be best if I waited in the car. By the way, you might bring your umbrella when you come out. It\u2019s really begun to storm.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had finished for the night. \u201cI\u2019ll see everyone tomorrow,\u201d she said, raising her hand in farewell as she started toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing this weekend?\u201d Teri called out.</p><p>Rachel shrugged. \u201cNothing much. Right now I have to pick up my car at the garage on Harbor Street</p><p>. I had the oil changed. Then I\u2019m going home to soak in a hot bath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames can take you,\u201d Teri offered. No reason he couldn\u2019t. All he\u2019d be doing otherwise was sitting in the car\u2014reading, no doubt. But it wouldn\u2019t take him long to drop Rachel off and by the time he came back, Teri figured she\u2019d be ready.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s all right,\u201d Rachel said, shaking her head. \u201cThe exercise will do me good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s raining out! Why get wet when James is here twiddling his thumbs? He can easily drive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be my pleasure, Miss Rachel,\u201d James told her in that polite way of his.</p><p>Rachel gave him a smile. \u201cThank you. Then I accept.\u201d</p><p>Teri walked out the door into the interior of the mall with her.</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate this,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cYou\u2019re a good friend, Teri. The best I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>She sounded so depressed, it was all Teri could do not to throw both arms around her. \u201cHey, if you need to talk or anything, just give me a call.\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled a little shakily. \u201cThank you, I will. Do you have plans for tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Christie\u2019s coming over this evening and we\u2019re going to watch Grease.\u201d It was a musical they\u2019d loved when they were kids. They knew all the songs and planned to sing along. They\u2019d have popcorn and then later on, some ice cream, the expensive kind. It would be a girls\u2019 night in.</p><p>At the mention of her sister, James lowered his gaze. Their romance seemed to be at a standstill; something must\u2019ve happened because Christie had insisted on driving over on her own.</p><p>\u201cThe weekend\u2019s open, though,\u201d Teri said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s get together. I\u2019ll phone you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do,\u201d Teri said, eager to help in any way she could. At the beginning of her relationship with Bobby, Rachel had been a wonderful confidante, discreet, sensible and encouraging. Teri wanted to do the same thing for her friend now. She looked over her shoulder and wished she had a few more minutes to talk. This was the first time all day that Rachel had opened up to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you in the morning,\u201d Rachel said as she headed out the mall door to the parking lot.</p><p>Standing by the car, James had the umbrella ready. It was raining steadily now and almost dark.</p><p>Teri returned to the salon and finished Mrs. Dawson\u2019s perm and waited for James.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>Thirty minutes passed, and he still wasn\u2019t back. When she called Rachel\u2019s cell, she immediately got voice mail. James didn\u2019t answer his phone, either. She tried Rachel\u2019s house. Same thing.</p><p>Unsure of what else to do, Teri called her sister. \u201cDo you mind swinging by the salon for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s James?\u201d Christie immediately asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He was going to run Rachel to the garage to get her car, but he hasn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you try his cell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t answering and neither is Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Christie hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit odd, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d More than odd. Definitely out of the ordinary\u2014and even a little frightening. \u201cAre you coming or not?\u201d Teri asked. Otherwise she\u2019d call one of the few cabs in town. Bobby was probably starting to worry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said with a relieved sigh. Bobby wanted her to quit her job, and incidents like this didn\u2019t help. She had no idea where James and Rachel had gone or why they weren\u2019t answering their cell phones. There had to be a perfectly logical explanation, she told herself; she wasn\u2019t going to stress over it.</p><p>Her sister drove up in her rattletrap of a car, the exhaust belching oil. Leaning across, she unlocked the passenger door and shoved it open. Teri leaped gratefully inside, damp from her short sprint to the car.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from James?\u201d Christie asked before she\u2019d said hello.</p><p>Teri hid a smile. \u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he\u2019s at your place now,\u201d Christie speculated. \u201cHe just forgot to come back for you.\u201d</p><p>Teri didn\u2019t believe that for a minute. James was a paragon of responsibility; he\u2019d never shirk his duties. Despite her resolve not to worry, she was beginning to feel anxious.</p><p>Christie was unusually quiet on the ride home.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have the hots for her?\u201d she blurted out as they approached the long driveway on Seaside Avenue</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames for Rachel, you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho else do you think I\u2019m talking about?\u201d Christie asked irritably.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d If James was interested in anyone, Teri suspected it was her very own sister.</p><p>As soon as they pulled in, the front door flew open and Bobby rushed out into the cold, drenching rain. He practically yanked her from the car. Then he was holding her. Hard. His fists dug into the small of Teri\u2019s back and his breathing was shallow and fast.</p><p>Something was drastically wrong. He\u2019d been worried about her in the past, but he\u2019d never done anything like this.</p><p>\u201cBobby! Bobby, what is it?\u201d</p><p>By the time he let her go, they were both soaked to the skin, wet hair matted to their heads, rivulets of water running down their faces. He started babbling, the words frantic, incoherent.</p><p>Before he\u2019d finished, the sheriff\u2019s vehicle rolled into the driveway, lights flashing. Troy Davis stepped out, and the four of them went into the house together.</p><p>\u201cSo everything\u2019s all right?\u201d Troy said, looking at Teri. \u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I am. Did my husband contact you?\u201d Really, this was too much, even for Bobby. She was only an hour late.</p><p>\u201cKidnapped,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Christie looked from one man to the other.</p><p>\u201cHe said he had you,\u201d Bobby said, his eyes wide with a mixture of shock and relief. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say it, exactly, but he implied it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Troy Davis asked sharply. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVladimir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d Christie shouted as understanding came. \u201cThey have James and Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Teri stared at her, then at Bobby. That was it\u2014James and Rachel had been kidnapped. Whoever had taken them must\u2019ve assumed they had Teri. If it was the two men who\u2019d originally confronted her, they\u2019d realize quickly enough that they had the wrong woman. The question was what they\u2019d do once they became aware of their mistake. Terror froze her and she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>The ringing of the phone cut into the room, freeing Teri from her sudden paralysis. Dragging in a deep breath, she lunged at the jangling phone. Caller ID told her it was Bruce Peyton.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t imagine why he\u2019d called her unless he\u2019d somehow heard...</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d Teri said, picking up the receiver. It took all her strength to speak normally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to bother you, Teri, but do you know where Rachel is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...Was she supposed to see Jolene tonight?\u201d</p><p>His hesitation was brief. \u201cNo. I need to talk to her and I can\u2019t seem to find her. She usually has her cell phone but I haven\u2019t been able to get hold of her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps you should come to my house,\u201d Teri suggested. She couldn\u2019t very well tell him over the phone that Rachel had been abducted.</p><p>Again he paused. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...really. Could you stop by at your earliest convenience?\u201d Then, thinking quickly, she added, \u201cIt\u2019d probably be best if Jolene wasn\u2019t with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sounds serious,\u201d Bruce murmured, but without quizzing her further, he said he was on his way. When she\u2019d replaced the receiver, she turned to the sheriff, intent on hearing exactly what had happened. Bobby, not surprisingly, was an emotional mess.</p><p>Before she could ask a single question, the phone rang again. Teri would\u2019ve been content to let voice mail pick up when Christie suddenly screamed, \u201cIt\u2019s James!\u201d</p><p>She would\u2019ve grabbed it if not for Sheriff Davis. \u201cLet me take this,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Nodding shyly, Christie backed away, her mouth covered with both hands. Teri noticed that her sister was trembling. At this point, she didn\u2019t know whom to comfort first, Bobby or Christie.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis,\u201d Troy announced. He listened for a minute, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll send a patrol car for you. They\u2019ll be there in five minutes.\u201d He immediately ordered a patrol vehicle to the Dairy Queen off Highway 16, then requested an APB on Bobby\u2019s car. When he\u2019d finished, he spoke to Teri, obviously considering her the most rational of the group. \u201cIt\u2019s James Wilbur and Rachel Pendergast. I\u2019m having them brought into the station for questioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t keep them long will you, Sheriff?\u201d Christie asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019ve been through enough as it is.\u201d He frowned. \u201cApparently the two men in question pushed your friends out of the limo and made off with it. We\u2019ll be on the lookout.\u201d</p><p>He left soon afterward, telling them he\u2019d be in touch soon, and Teri made a fresh pot of coffee. She was desperately in need of a heavy dose of caffeine laced with sugar, and she assumed the others were, too. The shock was just beginning to hit her; she couldn\u2019t seem to stop shaking.</p><p>They were sitting at the kitchen table, trying to make sense of what had taken place, when Bruce arrived. Teri answered the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Rachel?\u201d he demanded as soon as he was inside the house. \u201cWhere is she, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Teri released a pent-up breath. She wasn\u2019t sure how to explain that her best friend had been kidnapped, that the men who\u2019d been after her had mistakenly grabbed Rachel. Apparently they\u2019d decided to grab James, as well; they must have overtaken him and stolen the car. Had they forced him to drive?</p> <p>She glanced at her watch and tried to speak calmly. \u201cMy guess is that Rachel\u2019s talking Sheriff Davis\u2019s ear off right about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was kidnapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKidnapped!\u201d Bruce\u2019s eyes widened and his mouth sagged open as if he couldn\u2019t believe what she\u2019d told him.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she said, leading him into the kitchen. Christie poured a cup of coffee and then spooned in sugar, stirring it briskly before she handed him the mug.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked again, ignoring the coffee.</p><p>Bobby began to explain, but his version was confusing, and Christie\u2019s attempted corrections didn\u2019t help, and then Teri added her voice to the melee.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Bruce whistled loudly. \u201cOne at a time.\u201d He pointed at Bobby. \u201cYou first.\u201d</p><p>Bobby simply shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t. All I know is that Teri\u2019s safe. I\u2019m sorry this happened to Rachel because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Teri said, reaching for her husband\u2019s hand. She chafed his cold fingers.</p><p>Finally Teri described the events of the night, insofar as she knew them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the sheriff\u2019s,\u201d Bruce said. He got up immediately and tore out of the house.</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Christie said, following Bruce.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait here,\u201d Teri shouted after them. Sheriff Davis had said he\u2019d call the house, which was a good reason to stay. Besides, Teri doubted she and Bobby could contribute much to the investigation at the moment. The sheriff would have more questions for them later.</p><p>As soon as they were alone, Bobby stood and walked into the living room.</p><p>\u201cBobby!\u201d Teri said, hurrying after him.</p><p>Then she was in his arms, and he was holding her and kissing her as if he never intended to stop. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore,\u201d he whispered between kisses.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisk losing you and our baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby, we can\u2019t let Vladimir blackmail you into giving up your title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll throw the match,\u201d he declared. \u201cI don\u2019t care. Winning isn\u2019t important anymore. I won\u2019t put you at risk again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Teri, the decision\u2019s already been made. I\u2019m going to play Vladimir. That\u2019s what he wants. That\u2019s what this whole kidnapping was about. He wanted to force my hand. And he did.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Five</p><p>Cold and shivering inside the sheriff\u2019s office, Rachel clutched the thin blanket a deputy had draped over her shoulders. James had been immediately transported to HarrisonHospital. Another deputy had talked to him briefly en route.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really see anything,\u201d Rachel reiterated. \u201cThe men\u2014there were two of them\u2014swarmed the car when James drove into the service station. It was dark and rainy and everything happened really fast.\u201d Gathering the blanket more closely around her, she said, \u201cThey dragged me out of the car and blindfolded me, then threw me in the backseat.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff was taping her as she spoke. \u201cAt what point did they realize you weren\u2019t the person they wanted?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Rachel couldn\u2019t be sure. All she remembered was that there\u2019d been a flurry of raised, angry voices. \u201cThey weren\u2019t speaking English,\u201d she said. \u201cRussian, maybe. That\u2019s what James told me later.\u201d She bit her lip, trying to recall any details that might help. \u201cWhen they did speak English, they had quite heavy accents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to them?\u201d the sheriff asked next.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Rachel doubted she could\u2019ve uttered a single word. Terror had gripped her from the start. James was the one who\u2019d put up a struggle.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d she asked urgently. \u201cJames? Bobby Polgar\u2019s driver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t received an update yet,\u201d the sheriff told her.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to protect me,\u201d she said, feeling bad that she hadn\u2019t thought to ask about him sooner. Although she\u2019d been blindfolded, she\u2019d heard their captors hitting James, heard the thud of fists on bone, his grunts of pain. One of the kidnappers had been driving the car, the other riding shotgun. James had been bound and blindfolded, too, and shoved onto the floor in the back, at her feet. She\u2019d been aware of the two men arguing, and then it had apparently been decided that she and James would be set free. Soon after that, they\u2019d been pushed out, close to the freeway. She\u2019d torn off her blindfold and helped release James from his bonds. He\u2019d used his cell phone and called Bobby\u2019s house\u2014the call Sheriff Davis had taken.</p><p>She\u2019d lost her phone in the scuffle at the garage and, in retrospect, she was astonished that he still had his. She supposed it went to show that these kidnappers were amateurs\u2014thugs and bumblers.</p><p>James had been so calm and professional, whereas she shook so badly that, despite his injuries, he\u2019d had to support her as they stumbled to the restaurant. They weren\u2019t at the Dairy Queen more than two minutes when the patrol car pulled up. One of the deputies called the aid car for James; the other escorted Rachel to the station.</p><p>A commotion erupted outside the sheriff\u2019s office, and Rachel recognized Bruce\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cBruce.\u201d She jumped up from the chair and looked pleadingly at Sheriff Davis. \u201cCan I speak to him? Please, I need to see him.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch tomorrow. Take it easy, now.\u201d</p><p>When she opened the door, she saw Bruce in the hallway, arguing with a deputy. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d he was saying with barely controlled impatience. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes locked, and without another word they were in each other\u2019s arms. His embrace was almost suffocating, but Rachel didn\u2019t care. She needed to be held and comforted and loved. She\u2019d been so frightened, and that whole time, the one person she\u2019d thought about was Bruce. Not Nate. Bruce. With a dirty rag covering her eyes, sprawled in the back of a speeding car, her life in danger\u2014that was when she\u2019d known beyond any doubt that she loved him.</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t she figured it out earlier? Nate was charming, she was fond of him, but he wasn\u2019t the man who\u2019d moved into her mind and refused to leave. The man she thought about when she might have been on the way to her death.</p><p>Now she needed to tell both men her feelings....</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Bruce stepped back just far enough to study her. With gentle hands, he brushed the hair from her bruised forehead and gazed deeply into her eyes. Whatever he was searching for he must have found, because he drew her back into his embrace with a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re all right,\u201d he whispered over and over again. \u201cThank God...\u201d</p><p>In Bruce\u2019s arms, the trembling subsided, the bruises stopped hurting and she finally began to feel warm.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d he said, still holding her close.</p><p>She told him what she knew but the \u201cwhy\u201d of it remained a mystery.</p><p>\u201cThey were after Teri,\u201d she explained.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThey botched the kidnapping when they took you by mistake.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d worked out that this whole mess had to do with Bobby, but what the thugs had hoped to achieve she could only speculate. Right now, none of that mattered. Because Bruce was with her.</p><p>He continued to hold her, murmuring encouragement as they stood in that drafty hallway.</p><p>It suddenly occurred to Rachel to ask, \u201cHow come you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI phoned Teri. You weren\u2019t answering your cell and I thought she might know where you were.\u201d She felt his shrug. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about...something, but this isn\u2019t the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did Teri say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said I should come to her house, and that was when I found out you\u2019d been kidnapped. I wasn\u2019t there more than a few minutes when James called and I heard you\u2019d been set free. That\u2019s also when I learned you\u2019d be at the sheriff\u2019s office, so I came straight here.\u201d</p><p>As if he\u2019d just realized he was holding her\u2014and shouldn\u2019t be\u2014he abruptly dropped his arms.</p><p>All at once Rachel was cold again. She wanted Bruce to hold her. She needed him.</p><p>She took one small step toward him. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p> <p>He raised his arms, apparently to abide by her request, and then dropped them again. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou know why not. How would Nate feel if he could see us like this?\u201d</p><p>She knew exactly how Nate would feel. He\u2019d be angry and upset. Jealous. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she began, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to you, Rachel. That\u2019s why I was looking for you this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me...about what?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the best time. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to hear now. But if he wasn\u2019t ready to speak, she was. \u201cI need you, Bruce, no one else. Not Nate. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he countered sharply, as though afraid to believe her. \u201cYou need a warm body. If Nate was here instead of me, you\u2019d want him. We\u2019ll talk about this tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes pleaded with him for understanding. Her own feelings were clear now and although she recognized that she loved Bruce and wanted to be with him, she couldn\u2019t say any more. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cWill you take me home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but the look on his face was one of wariness.</p> <p>After speaking to the sheriff again, Rachel hurried out to the car, where Bruce was waiting for her. He had the heater on, and the warm air welcomed her, enveloped her. She\u2019d been terrified, her sense of security destroyed. What she craved most\u2014other than the comfort of those she loved\u2014was to be surrounded by familiar things. She needed to be home.</p><p>The drive took place in almost total silence. When Bruce parked in front of the house, Rachel turned to him, hoping for some word, some gesture of reassurance. He kept the car running, letting her know he had no intention of going inside with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your door,\u201d he said curtly.</p><p>It was such an old-fashioned courtesy, and she was grateful for it. He took her house key from her trembling hands and unlocked the dead bolt and then, without looking at her, returned the key.</p><p>Before he could stop her, Rachel slipped her arms around his neck and raised her lips to his, showing how much she loved him, now and always.</p><p>He resisted, but not for long. His mouth opened to hers, his breath warm and moist. And for the first time since she\u2019d been abducted, Rachel felt completely safe. Completely loved and cherished.</p><p>Bruce broke off the kiss before she was ready for it to end. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re...all right,\u201d he said, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cI am, too. Thank you for being here, thank you for bringing me home and thank you for that kiss,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He stared down at the concrete step and nodded. Then he turned, stumbling in his haste to leave.</p><p>Christie wondered why the attendant behind the admissions desk in HarrisonHospital\u2019s ER was being such a grouch. All she knew was that she wouldn\u2019t let some old biddy keep her out. She was going to see James, whatever it took.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot go inside those doors and if you persist,\u201d the woman said, \u201cI\u2019ll call security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead.\u201d Christie figured she had a good two to three minutes to find James before the rent-a-cop located her and tossed her out. A lot could happen in those minutes.</p><p>But just as she made her way toward the swinging doors, James stepped out. His face was battered\u2014one eye had swollen completely shut, his cheekbone was badly bruised and he had a split lip. His arm was bandaged and in a sling.</p><p>\u201cJames!\u201d She breathed his name in a rush of near-panic.</p><p>For a moment, Christie thought she was going to be sick. To her horror, tears flooded her eyes. She wasn\u2019t the kind of person who wept easily, but she was weeping now.</p><p>\u201cOh, James...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d he said hoarsely when she came toward him. \u201cI have two broken ribs and I\u2019m afraid a hug would kill me.\u201d</p><p>She blinked rapidly in an effort to forestall the tears, not that it did any good. \u201cLet me help you,\u201d she begged.</p><p>He seemed reluctant to have her touch him. \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d Slipping her arm around his waist, she led him outside. At least the rain had stopped. They walked, step by unhurried step, to where she\u2019d parked her car. \u201cDid the doctor give you a prescription?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s in my pocket. For pain. What I need most, they told me, is rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd chicken soup,\u201d she added. It was all she could think of. \u201cI\u2019ll get the prescription filled and buy you a can of soup.\u201d</p><p>She half expected him to argue. His acceptance of her being there told her how much pain he was in.</p><p>Although he didn\u2019t complain, the walk to the parking lot obviously left him in agony. He looked pale and drained by the time she got the passenger door open and helped him inside. Then she dashed around the front of the car and slid into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve taken a taxi home,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d She put her key in the ignition, then glanced at him. \u201cI should call Bobby and Teri,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t have a cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to them a few minutes ago,\u201d James informed her. \u201cFrom a pay phone near the ER.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe told me the police have already recovered the limousine. It was abandoned by the railway tracks.\u201d</p><p>She shifted the car into gear, watching as even the slightest movement made him grimace in pain. \u201cI\u2019ll drive very slowly.\u201d</p><p>Halfway back to the house, she started to cry again, the tears slipping soundlessly down her cheeks. She was shocked that seeing him like this had such an emotional impact on her. She told herself a dozen times a day that she found him a nuisance, but she knew that wasn\u2019t how she really felt. She was falling for this guy. Falling hard.</p><p>As soon as she pulled up to the house, Bobby and Teri hurried out to see James.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s badly hurt,\u201d Christie said in a stern voice. \u201cKeep your distance. His ribs are broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, James.\u201d Teri began to cry, too. \u201cJames, stay at our place, okay? Those stairs to your apartment are too much. We have a downstairs guest room and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he insisted. \u201cNo. I can manage.\u201d</p><p>Christie knew his stoicism and his need for privacy would keep him from accepting Teri\u2019s suggestion, and she understood that, but it was hard to watch him suffer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make Vladimir pay for this,\u201d Bobby said through gritted teeth. His fists were clenched at his sides.</p><p>Christie\u2019s hand was on James\u2019s arm as she turned to look at Bobby. \u201cIf you need any help with that, let me know.\u201d She spoke fiercely and she meant every word.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Teri asked.</p><p>Christie took the prescription out of her purse. \u201cGet this filled and pick up four cans of chicken noodle soup.\u201d She\u2019d seen a grocery store flyer that advertised four for three dollars; having grown up poor, she automatically noticed a bargain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Bobby said, following Teri.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you to your rooms,\u201d Christie said, again clasping James\u2019s elbow and gently steering him toward the outside staircase that led to his quarters above the garage.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine now. Thank you,\u201d he said when they\u2019d reached the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cForget it.\u201d Christie wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer, and he must\u2019ve realized that because he capitulated without an argument. Bad enough, she figured, that he\u2019d been so stubborn, refusing to stay at Teri\u2019s house. They took the stairs slowly and each one made him wince. When they finally got to the landing, Christie had her arm around his waist and he was leaning against her. The door was unlocked and, as she\u2019d suspected, his quarters were immaculate. He pointed in the direction of the bedroom and she supported him as he hobbled toward it.</p><p>His bed was made with military precision and even when he sat down the blanket didn\u2019t wrinkle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine now,\u201d he said again, more firmly this time.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Christie was reluctant to leave.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that?\u201d she asked, trying to disguise the pain his comment had inflicted.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t meet her gaze. \u201cYou said I\u2019m a stuffed shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want anything to do with me,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou said that...the last time I drove you home...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did?\u201d She couldn\u2019t even remember, although they\u2019d argued about what she\u2019d called his \u201chovering\u201d and \u201coverprotectiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked\u2014yet again\u2014that I not drive you anymore.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t see that as any big deal. \u201cI\u2019m capable of driving myself, you know.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cAnd I\u2019m capable of looking after myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, hands on her hips. \u201cWe\u2019re both capable people. Now climb into bed and I\u2019ll tuck you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll go?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He averted his head as he mumbled, \u201cPlease leave the room.\u201d</p><p>Furious\u2014and not sure why\u2014she stomped out of the room and slammed the door. Then she stood on the other side of the door and waited. Twice, when she heard him stifle a groan, she nearly burst in, but she knew he wouldn\u2019t appreciate the intrusion. Fine, she\u2019d see that he was safely in bed and then she\u2019d take off. If he didn\u2019t want her around, she wasn\u2019t going to make a pest of herself.</p><p>After two or three minutes of silence, she asked, \u201cCan I come in now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She turned the knob and cautiously opened the door, to find him dressed in pajamas. He\u2019d apparently taken off the sling around his arm, then put it back on, all by himself. That must\u2019ve hurt. So he was a stuffed shirt and a glutton for punishment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She peeled back the sheets and plumped up the pillows and finally assisted him into bed. He lowered himself onto the mattress with his teeth clenched and eyes tightly closed. Christie bit her lip, resisting the urge to cry out.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can do?\u201d she asked once he was settled.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d But instead she leaned down and pressed her lips to his forehead. \u201cGood night, James.\u201d When he frowned, she whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m going now.\u201d What she didn\u2019t say aloud was I\u2019ll be back. He\u2019d discover that soon enough.</p> <p>Then she left his apartment and bounced down the outside stairs. Thirty minutes later she returned from her trip to the all-night grocery. Teri came out to meet her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby and I got the medication and the soup. I gave him the first capsule with a glass of water but he didn\u2019t want anything to eat.\u201d She walked with Christie to the bottom of the stairs that led to his apartment. \u201cApparently he put up a real fight when those...those mobsters attacked him and Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd paid the price,\u201d Christie said.</p> <p>\u201cI was wrong about him,\u201d Teri admitted. \u201cI assumed that if anything like this ever happened, I\u2019d be the one defending him.\u201d</p><p>Until this evening, Christie had shared her sister\u2019s assessment. \u201cHe surprised me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bringing him that?\u201d Teri asked, pointing at the object in her right hand.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014even though he doesn\u2019t want me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to go, so I did. I\u2019ll just leave this upstairs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome over when you\u2019re finished.\u201d</p><p>Christie nodded. It was well after midnight now, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep for a long, long time.</p><p>Teri left her and Christie climbed up the stairs and, as silently as possible, let herself into James\u2019s apartment. Guided by the moonlight and walking on the tips of her toes, she made her way into his bedroom.</p><p>Then, very carefully, she placed the long-stemmed red rose across the empty pillow beside him.</p><p>Thirty-Six</p><p>Olivia\u2019s illness affected Grace\u2019s mood, leaving her depressed and enervated, although she tried hard to conceal that from her friend. But now that Olivia had met with the surgeon and the oncologist, she seemed more at ease with what was happening. She\u2019d have surgery, followed by radiation and several months of chemotherapy. With her characteristic optimism and fighting spirit, Olivia had made her peace with the diagnosis and the coming treatment. Everyone knew about Olivia\u2019s cancer now. Charlotte was badly shaken, as Grace had been. The one who remained strong and positive, the one who held the family together, was\u2014as always\u2014Olivia. She said she was ready for whatever the future might bring.</p><p>Like Jack, like Charlotte and Ben, like Justine and Seth, Grace was determined to stand by her side.</p><p>As for the problems with her renters, Grace had a fatalistic outlook. She\u2019d agreed to rent the house to Darryl and Pamela Smith, and her decision had been a costly one.</p> <p>The cost continued to escalate now that there were attorneys involved. That wasn\u2019t the end of it, either. Even her former neighbors were upset with her. These were people Grace had known and been friends with for decades. Mrs. Vessey was convinced that the Smiths were selling drugs. Grace didn\u2019t know if that was true, but she didn\u2019t doubt it was possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d Grace moaned on Wednesday morning as she sat at the kitchen table prior to leaving for work. She glanced down at her coffee and toast and realized her appetite was gone. The problem had weighed on her ever since another call from Mrs. Vessey informed her that the police had been called, yet again, about an all-night party.</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to Olivia, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Cliff asked, joining her in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d In spite of her own far more important concerns, Olivia had discussed the situation with Grace, offering advice on how to get the Smiths evicted. The legal process was emotionally, not to mention financially, draining. First, she had to obtain what was known as an Unlawful Retainer, and if the Smiths didn\u2019t pay the outstanding rent within three days, the matter would be brought up for a court hearing. That could take two weeks, but depending on the court schedule, it might be longer.</p><p>The Smiths were pros at prolonging the process, according to what Judy had learned. They\u2019d managed to live in their last place rent-free for eight months.</p><p>\u201cOlivia said it could take months to evict this couple. Judy tried to warn me.\u201d Grace sighed. \u201cThe Smiths are something else,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re experts at working the system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the worst of it,\u201d she murmured. She hadn\u2019t wanted to say anything to Cliff because he\u2019d get upset and she was distressed enough for both of them.</p><p>Cliff poured himself a cup of coffee and leaned against the counter. \u201cOkay, out with it. What else is going on?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, trying to make light of it, although she was sick about the whole mess. And sick of it. \u201cHow,\u201d she asked Cliff, \u201ccan one snap decision cause me all this anguish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014tell me.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of her coffee, hardly noticing that it was cold. \u201cI drove past the house, and Cliff, it looks just terrible. I don\u2019t think the lawn\u2019s been mowed in months. There\u2019s a broken-down car sitting in the front yard.\u201d Grace bit her lip. \u201cThere\u2019s junk everywhere, Cliff, and there\u2019s damage to the exterior paint. If that\u2019s how the outside looks, can you imagine what it\u2019s like inside?\u201d</p><p>She remembered 204 Rosewood Lane</p><p>a year ago, with its pristine lawn, thriving flower garden and new paint job. The previous tenants, Ian and Cecilia Randall, had maintained the house beautifully during their brief stay. But now...</p><p>She wished she\u2019d sold the place, regardless of her emotional attachment to it. But in its present condition, that was no longer an option. She wondered what the house would be like six months from now.</p><p>\u201cOh, Grace,\u201d Cliff said. Walking over to her, he put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cSurely there\u2019s something that can be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf so, I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d She forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cDid that phone call Sunday morning have anything to do with your drive-by?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cMrs. Vessey said everyone in the neighborhood\u2019s angry. The police were by on Saturday night about a noise complaint. Plus Mr. and Mrs. Wicks are building a new house and they have to sell their current one. They\u2019re afraid their property value will be affected. I can\u2019t blame them for being worried, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cliff pinched his lips together. \u201cYou\u2019re already doing everything you can. No point in worrying about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how it can\u2019t worry me, and the thing is, Cliff, if they find out I\u2019m trying to get them evicted, they might do even more damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you let me help you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d What could Cliff possibly do? The law was the law, and as far as Grace could see, they had no alternative but to play this out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d He kissed her cheek and headed out to the barn, while Grace went into the bedroom to finish getting ready for work. Her aerobics class was that evening and Olivia still insisted on attending.</p><p>The day was, fortunately, a busy one, and Grace had little opportunity to brood on her own problems. She had two kindergarten classes in for story hour, probably her all-time favorite activity. Reading a Beverly Cleary book entertained her as much as it did the kids. She also had a training session with a new assistant, a couple of meetings, publishers\u2019 catalogs to study....</p><p>Only at lunchtime did she think about the house. As soon as the mess with these renters was cleared up, she\u2019d take care of the necessary repairs and put it on the market. Being a landlord was more trouble than it was worth.</p><p>The workout that evening exhausted her, although Olivia seemed energized and ready to take on the world. Breathing hard, Grace muttered, \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201d She bent forward, hands on her knees as she drew in deep breaths. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not supposed to hurt this much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pain, no gain,\u201d her friend said with a laugh.</p><p>If Grace had been a different kind of person, she might have envied Olivia\u2019s svelte figure and the effortless way she danced through the aerobic exercises.</p><p>\u201cIt might help if I lost weight,\u201d Grace mumbled. In her own opinion, she could easily stand to take off fifteen pounds. However, as Olivia had pointed out, this was what she\u2019d weighed for years. Her body was obviously comfortable at her present weight and whenever she made an effort to diet, she struggled to pry off every single ounce. It was a losing battle, and unfortunately the losing part didn\u2019t apply to her weight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you right now,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up my coconut cream pie.\u201d For an instant, her face grew solemn. \u201cUnless I have to.\u201d</p><p>Grace touched her arm. \u201cBeing the good friend I am, I\u2019ll eat it for you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed and jabbed her in the ribs. Soon afterward they were on their way to the PancakePalace where Goldie, as usual, awaited their arrival. She had the coffee poured and the pie dished up even before they were inside.</p><p>Grace had taken the first creamy, luscious forkful when she saw Cliff pull into the parking lot. \u201cCliff\u2019s here,\u201d she said in surprise. If there was a problem at home\u2014or with the house on Rosewood\u2014he could reach her on her cell.</p><p>Cliff didn\u2019t walk into the PancakePalace alone. Jack Griffin was with him.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Olivia exclaimed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we just thought we\u2019d drop in on our wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hey, Jack,\u201d Cliff said with a grin, \u201cI don\u2019t think they want us here.\u201d He slid into the booth next to Grace, and Jack joined his wife.</p><p>\u201cYou going to share that?\u201d Cliff asked, nodding at her pie.</p><p>\u201cGet your own.\u201d She lifted the plate and turned so Cliff couldn\u2019t steal a bite.</p><p>Cliff took her at her word and waved his arm to get Goldie\u2019s attention. She lit up like a starburst when she saw the two men.</p><p>Bringing the coffeepot, Goldie bustled over. \u201cSo, gentlemen, to what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d she asked, filling the beige mugs.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pie inspectors,\u201d Cliff announced. \u201cWe\u2019re here to see if your product passes our quality test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmph.\u201d Goldie\u2019s frown was as transparent as her gruff manner. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you anything but coconut cream,\u201d she said, eyeing Olivia and Grace. \u201cI can\u2019t get either of them to order anything else. We have the best apple-raisin pie in the county and you\u2019d think they could at least give it a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bring me a piece of that,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cWhat about you, Jack? I\u2019m buying.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a slice of pear pie if you have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Goldie said, beaming with approval. She left and returned a couple of minutes later with two extra-big slices, which she set on the table.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cliff said, after cutting into his apple-raisin pie. \u201cWant to know why we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean it wasn\u2019t for the pie?\u201d Grace teased.</p> <p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, no, excellent though it is.\u201d</p><p>The two men seemed very pleased with themselves, and Grace figured they\u2019d explain this unexpected visit soon enough.</p><p>Five minutes later, they did\u2014but not until every crumb of pie was gone.</p><p>Leaning back, Cliff gave her a satisfied grin. \u201cYou might be interested to know that at this very minute, the renters on Rosewood Lane</p><p>are in the process of moving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow? Tonight?\u201d Grace gasped. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cCliff called me this afternoon with an idea for persuading these creeps to leave town.\u201d</p><p>Olivia looked concerned. \u201cDid you threaten them? Because if you did, I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Jack shook his head.</p><p>Cliff shrugged. \u201cThe two of us, you mean? We weren\u2019t anywhere near them.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t seem convinced of their innocence. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell us exactly what you did.\u201d</p> <p>Jack gestured to Cliff. \u201cYou tell. It was your idea, and a mighty fine one if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to.\u201d Cliff took a last swig of coffee. \u201cAfter seeing how upset Grace was this morning, I decided there had to be a way to get those people to leave.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded uncertainly. She couldn\u2019t even guess what he\u2019d come up with. \u201cAnd?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s when I talked to Jack,\u201d Cliff continued. \u201cI had an idea I wanted to run by him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so impressed with Cliff\u2019s plan that I asked to be part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Cliff, you\u2019re brilliant,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the biker bar off Heron Avenue</p><p>?\u201d Cliff asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Grace had never been inside. It was a wooden structure that resembled a saloon out of an old western. With its sagging roof, the place seemed about to cave in. The Horse with No Name had become a popular watering hole for a rough biker crowd from miles around.</p><p>\u201cJack and I paid the bar a visit,\u201d Cliff went on to say. \u201cI stood in the middle of the room and said I was having trouble with some deadbeat renters who didn\u2019t seem inclined to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d Grace burst out.</p><p>\u201cI most certainly did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe promised a keg of beer to anyone who\u2019d be willing to ride to the house and convince the renters it was time they looked for housing elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Cliff said and raised his hands as if anticipating Grace\u2019s objections. \u201cI explained that they were to do no bodily harm, although they could threaten all they liked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t rightly say,\u201d Jack said virtuously, then dipped his finger in Olivia\u2019s remaining coconut cream pie and brought it to his lips. \u201cAll we know is that about ten of them hopped on their motorbikes. Big, loud bikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig, loud guys, too,\u201d Cliff added. \u201cLots of tattoos and leather. Mean-looking bunch. If they showed up at my place, I wouldn\u2019t want to argue with \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were back about twenty minutes later,\u201d Jack finished.</p><p>\u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cJust that there shouldn\u2019t be a problem anymore and that they wanted their keg of beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat keg cost Cliff less than a hundred bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re leaving?\u201d Grace asked in astonishment. \u201cThe Smiths are leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving?\u201d Jack repeated, his grin so big it must\u2019ve hurt his face. \u201cCliff and I drove past and they\u2019d already loaded up their car. My guess is they\u2019ll be gone by morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness.\u201d Grace could hardly believe it. \u201cYou\u2019re not making this up, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I swear to you it\u2019s true. Your tenant problems are over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff Harding, have I told you how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me enough to share your pie?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cNot only that, I\u2019ll buy an entire one just for you.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Seven</p><p>After the kidnapping attempt, Bobby had agreed to a match. Apparently, the Russian had given him specific instructions on the first few moves he was to make, moves that would guarantee a loss because Bobby would find himself in what chess players referred to as the Black Hole. So far, no one had devised a method of escaping from this position. Bobby intended to be the first.</p><p>Ever since his conversation with Vladimir, Bobby had been sullen and uncommunicative. Teri was furious that her husband had given in to his blackmailer, although she understood that he felt he had no other option.</p><p>The Russian\u2019s henchmen had disappeared and, according to the sheriff, the investigation had stalled. They\u2019d found no solid evidence linking Vladimir to the crime; not surprisingly, this was a man who knew how to cover his tracks.</p><p>Bobby planned to do something about that, and his plan started with a long, secretive discussion in the sheriff\u2019s office. The next step would be a chess match in New York City on November 11. In one week\u2019s time...</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t lose,\u201d Teri had protested.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d Her husband was nothing if not confident.</p><p>Monday morning Teri had a doctor\u2019s appointment, a routine checkup for her and the baby. The salon wasn\u2019t open on Mondays, which made it a good day for her appointments. She dreaded stepping on the scale and closed her eyes when she did. After the initial bouts of late-afternoon \u201cmorning\u201d sickness, she\u2019d never felt healthier. The unfortunate thing, in her opinion, was that it meant her appetite had returned.</p><p>The appointment took only fifteen minutes and she was out of the office well ahead of schedule. Rachel had asked if they could meet for lunch. She seemed to have recovered from the terror of the kidnapping, for which Teri felt profoundly thankful.</p><p>The Pot Belly Deli was relatively empty, so Teri secured a window table and waited for her friend. The soups were a specialty; so were the huge sandwiches but she ignored those. Seeing that she needed to watch her calorie intake\u2014the doctor\u2019s words, not hers\u2014Teri decided on vegetable beef soup, with a plain green salad. Boring but nutritious.</p><p>Rachel breezed in right on schedule. \u201cHi, Teri. You look great.\u201d She swung her purse strap off her shoulder and unfastened the buttons of her coat. \u201cHow\u2019s James?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. He\u2019s still in rough shape but I can see a real improvement.\u201d Teri\u2019s admiration for Bobby\u2019s driver had risen tenfold. She was impressed by his bravery and, she had to admit, by his stoicism, although it frustrated her, too. She knew the broken ribs caused him a great deal of pain. Since the attack, he\u2019d kept pretty much to himself; he\u2019d refused the nurse Bobby had wanted to hire, refused everything.</p><p>Other than that first night, Christie hadn\u2019t been by to see him, but she phoned Teri a couple of times a day to ask how he was. Although Christie tried to be subtle with her questions, Teri saw through the queries easily enough.</p><p>\u201cPoor James,\u201d Rachel murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling okay?\u201d Teri felt obliged to ask. \u201cNo side effects?\u201d</p><p>Rachel shook her head. \u201cYou might find this difficult to believe,\u201d she said thoughtfully, \u201cbut...I\u2019m grateful for what happened.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t kidding; that didn\u2019t even begin to make sense. \u201cGrateful? In what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Rachel rubbed her forehead. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that horrible night, I don\u2019t know how long it would\u2019ve taken me to realize I love Bruce. He\u2019s the man I want to be with, Teri. I\u2019m sure of that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruce,\u201d Teri repeated slowly. She\u2019d been right all along.</p><p>\u201cAt first I thought James and I were both going to be killed,\u201d Rachel said, lowering her voice. \u201cI was terrified. You\u2019ve heard what they say about your life passing before your eyes? I didn\u2019t experience that, exactly, but I sure had a chance to think. Well, maybe think isn\u2019t the best word, because I felt like I had no control of the memories and images that were running through my mind. The person who was in my thoughts the most was Bruce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Teri said, unable to hold back her glee. Being right was just so satisfying. Especially when you were right about something good.</p><p>Suddenly it dawned on her that Rachel didn\u2019t seem happy about this discovery. \u201cSo...what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, Rachel picked up her menu and read it avidly, as if it was a best-selling novel.</p><p>\u201cRachel?\u201d Teri pulled away the menu so she could look at her friend. To her horror, she saw tears in Rachel\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Rachel whispered. \u201cTeri, I...\u201d She began rooting through her purse for a tissue.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Teri asked urgently. \u201cRachel, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because you love someone, that doesn\u2019t make it easy,\u201d Rachel said with a sob. \u201cAny of it.\u201d</p><p>Teri nodded sympathetically.</p><p>After taking a moment to regain her composure, Rachel said, \u201cI told Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Teri prompted. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d</p><p>Rachel blew her nose and answered with a shrug. \u201cAbout as awful as you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Rach, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first he didn\u2019t believe me. He said that because of the trauma, I wasn\u2019t thinking straight. I told him I knew what was in my heart, and then he really got upset. He said he was afraid this would happen. Because...because he\u2019s in San Diego, and that gave Bruce the...the home field advantage.\u201d She gazed up at Teri in wonderment. \u201cHe actually said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen and their sports analogies,\u201d Teri muttered. \u201cHow typical.\u201d</p><p>Still, breaking off a relationship was always difficult. Teri had done it often enough to know. Even when that bum Gary Underwood had emptied her bank account, she\u2019d felt guilty about kicking him out. She\u2019d worried about him while she was struggling to pay her rent because the jerk had stolen all her money!</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Teri told her.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to convince me I\u2019m in love with him and the fact is, I do love Nate\u2014just not as much as I love Bruce.\u201d</p><p>As if discerning that this was the worst possible moment to interrupt their conversation, the waitress came for their order.</p><p>\u201cIt ended badly,\u201d Rachel went on to explain after the waitress had left. \u201cNate said some unkind things and so did I.\u201d She paused. \u201cI believe he does have feelings for me, but I\u2019ve come to realize that he had an agenda, too. His mother didn\u2019t approve of me, but Nate saw the situation differently. I think he saw me in terms of his political career\u2014he wanted an ordinary wife because he felt that would enhance his image with voters.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. Not the \u2018ordinary\u2019 part, I mean, but the part about voters liking you. Who wouldn\u2019t like you?\u201d Teri said loyally.</p><p>Smiling through her tears, Rachel dug in her purse for a second tissue. \u201cI feel terrible, but it\u2019s over now and I doubt I\u2019ll hear from him again.\u201d</p><p>Teri let a few seconds go by before she asked, \u201cHave you talked to Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She exhaled slowly. \u201cThat conversation won\u2019t be any easier than the one I had with Nate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Rachel frowned, shaking her head. \u201cHe\u2019s behaving so oddly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in love with you,\u201d Teri said confidently, \u201cand it scares him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Rachel said slowly. \u201cMaybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to see Bruce anytime soon?\u201d</p> <p>She hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel!\u201d Why were people so stubborn? First James and her sister, and now Rachel and Bruce. Teri felt as if she personally had to take charge, as if she knew what they needed better than they did.</p><p>\u201cI will talk to him,\u201d Rachel promised. She sat up straighter. \u201cI tried to tell him on Friday after the...incident, but he didn\u2019t want to hear it. He told me I needed someone, that anyone would do and he just happened to be convenient. But that\u2019s not true,\u201d she said vehemently. \u201cWe were supposed to talk the next day and it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell him,\u201d Teri insisted.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said again. \u201cCan we talk about something else now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d Teri wracked her brain. She\u2019d read the Chronicle that morning; surely there\u2019d been some article of interest. The Harbor Street Gallery had been sold and would be staying open, after all. That was the front-page story, so Rachel probably knew about it already. As she was mulling over the local news, the waitress delivered their order.</p> <p>\u201cGuess what I heard?\u201d Rachel murmured into her soup. She\u2019d chosen the cream of broccoli with cheese, plus a caesar salad. Teri\u2019s meal looked bland by comparison. \u201cThe Taco Shack\u2019s being turned into a barbecue place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it ain\u2019t so,\u201d Teri groaned.</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d Rachel sounded equally disappointed.</p><p>\u201cYou and Bruce used to go there a lot, didn\u2019t you?\u201d If she could\u2019ve taken the words back, she would have. Rachel didn\u2019t need to be reminded of that right now.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Rachel stared out the window. The trees were bare and a few leaves skipped along the street, carried by the wind.</p><p>\u201cHow did the doctor\u2019s appointment go?\u201d she asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cFine. He suggested I walk every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel great,\u201d Teri was quick to tell her. \u201cAll I need to do is keep my weight down a bit. It\u2019s better for my blood pressure\u2014and the baby.\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. \u201cI wonder if I\u2019ll ever have children,\u201d she said longingly.</p><p>\u201cOf course you will. You should. You\u2019re a natural with kids.\u201d In fact, Teri marveled at her skill with children. Half her clientele seemed to be under the age of twelve. For that matter, it was how Rachel had met Bruce and Jolene, when Bruce had brought his daughter in for a haircut.</p><p>Rachel shrugged off the praise.</p><p>They paid for their lunch and started to walk along the waterfront, past the library and the marina, heading in the direction of the park.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t put off talking to Bruce,\u201d Teri warned. \u201cReally, what\u2019s the worst that can happen?\u201d</p><p>Hands deep in her pockets, Rachel looked out at the water. \u201cThe worst thing is, he might not love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. I see how Bruce looks at you.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile brightened Rachel\u2019s face. \u201cHe depends on me to help him with Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her, and Bruce knows that. He doesn\u2019t want me to move to California and I\u2019m afraid the only reason is his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, but there\u2019s one way to find out for sure, and that\u2019s to ask him.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Eight</p><p>As it happened, Rachel had a visit from Jolene that same day. The girl phoned her after school to ask if she could come over. Rachel picked her up, and Jolene told her about a fight she\u2019d had with her friend Michelle. Afterward, they painted their toenails and discussed the cute boys in her class. Rachel consoled Jolene about the apparent loss of her friendship with Michelle, then took her to the PancakePalace for an early supper. Jolene had, of course, called to obtain her father\u2019s permission. At around seven o\u2019clock, Rachel drove her home.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rach, I had fun,\u201d the twelve-year-old said as she opened the car door in front of her house.</p><p>Rachel shut off the engine. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come in and talk to your dad for a while.\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked surprised and then pleased. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d</p><p>Rachel drew on all her resolve, swallowed hard and walked to the house with Jolene.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d the girl shouted as she stepped inside. \u201cRachel\u2019s here.\u201d When there was no response, she shouted again, louder this time. \u201cDad!\u201d She peeked in the kitchen, then turned to Rachel. \u201cHe might be down in the basement.\u201d Leaving her standing in the hallway, Jolene opened a door and disappeared.</p><p>Soon afterward, Bruce came upstairs with Jolene at his heels. He wore a blue plaid flannel shirt and had a liberal coating of sawdust in his hair and on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cShould I come back later?\u201d Rachel asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can stay,\u201d Jolene said airily. \u201cDad does stuff with wood. He\u2019s always working on something.\u201d</p><p>Funny Rachel never knew that about him. She had the feeling there was a lot she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cBruce?\u201d She looked at him, frowning. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI was ready to take a break. By the way,\u201d he told his daughter, \u201cMichelle phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did?\u201d Jolene\u2019s eyes widened and she grinned at Rachel, who smiled encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cI said you\u2019d call her back as soon as you got home,\u201d Bruce added.</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d the girl asked Rachel excitedly.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. Call her back right now,\u201d she suggested. \u201cI was hoping to talk to your dad, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jolene gave her a thumbs-up and scampered off to make the call.</p><p>\u201cHow about if we have a cup of coffee?\u201d she said to Bruce. That would give her something to hold, something to do. He might not need a prop, but she did.</p><p>Bruce nodded, brushing the sawdust from his hands, and accompanied Rachel into the kitchen. He pulled out a chair at the table for her.</p><p>The room was a mess. Dirty dishes were piled in the sink and a box of crackers had toppled and spilled on the countertop. There was a saucepan on the stove with the remains of some canned stew he\u2019d heated up. The empty can stood nearby, beside a carton of milk.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting company,\u201d Bruce said. He put the milk in the refrigerator and turned to face her, hands tucked inside the back pockets of his jeans. \u201cI\u2019ll make coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother if it\u2019s any trouble,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cNo trouble.\u201d He reached for the glass pot, filled it with water and then emptied out the grounds from that morning.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to thank you again for coming to the sheriff\u2019s office the other night,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cRachel, listen, I was just happy you weren\u2019t hurt. It wasn\u2019t any heroic deed to drive you home, so you can stop thanking me. Why don\u2019t you get to the point?\u201d</p><p>His abruptness took her aback.</p><p>She\u2019d planned her little speech so carefully, but he was making this difficult. He stood as far away from her as his kitchen would allow, his hip pressed against the counter. \u201cActually,\u201d she said, dragging in a deep breath, \u201cthere are several things I want to say....\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d He continued with the coffee, pouring water into the machine and adding fresh grounds. When he\u2019d finished, he straddled the chair across from her.</p><p>This was better. At least they were eye to eye. \u201cNate and I\u2014\u201d She didn\u2019t get a chance to complete her sentence.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to marry him?\u201d There was a distant look on his face, as if he\u2019d already shut her out.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be marrying Nate.\u201d If she was hoping for a reaction, Bruce seemed determined not to give her one. \u201cIn fact, I probably won\u2019t see him again.\u201d</p><p>The coffeemaker made a gurgling sound. Bruce leaped up and collected clean mugs from the dishwasher. \u201cHow do you take your coffee?\u201d</p><p>Rachel was stunned he\u2019d ask. After six years, he knew the answer to that as well as she did.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he answered his own question. \u201cBlack, right?\u201d</p><p>She found his show of indifference more than insulting; she found it hurtful. They\u2019d had coffee together countless times!</p><p>All at once she was on her feet. \u201cThis was a bad idea.\u201d Bruce didn\u2019t need to say another word for Rachel to know his feelings. He had what he wanted, all he wanted, and that was a surrogate mother for his daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cComing here was a mistake.\u201d She blamed Teri for this. Teri was the one who\u2019d encouraged her to talk to Bruce. A lot of good that had done.</p><p>His eyes challenged her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s going on, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d She grabbed her handbag. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you, Bruce. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Not waiting for a reply, she headed out the door. At least now she knew, Rachel thought bitterly. He didn\u2019t want her to marry Nate, but he didn\u2019t want her himself. What an idiot she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cRachel! Rachel!\u201d It was Jolene who stood in the front door, calling after her.</p><p>Not Bruce.</p><p>Rachel waved but didn\u2019t stop. Back home, she felt restless and irritated and angry and hurt. Nothing held her attention for long. Mostly she was furious, then she was weepy and then furious all over again.</p><p>She tried to read, but her thoughts wandered. Getting online, she answered a couple of e-mails but wasn\u2019t in the mood for that, either. And she sure didn\u2019t feel like calling any of her so-called friends.</p><p>Finally, she popped in her favorite DVD, The Princess Bride, and made microwave popcorn. Although she wasn\u2019t hungry, she ate it anyway. Afterward she felt bloated and even more annoyed with herself.</p><p>At ten, she took a bath, put on her flannel nightgown and her extra-thick housecoat and flopped back down in front of the television to finish watching her movie.</p><p>She was startled when the doorbell rang at almost eleven. Checking the peephole, she staggered away from the door.</p><p>Bruce.</p><p>Heaving in a huge breath, she unfastened the lock and partially opened the door. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Bruce held a cardboard tray with two paper cups. \u201cI brought coffee,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit late for caffeine, don\u2019t you think?\u201d she asked coldly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s decaf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d As if that was a good reason, she moved aside, and he stepped into the house.</p><p>\u201cYours is black, just the way you like it.\u201d Pulling it from the cardboard holder, he handed it to her.</p> <p>Then he barged into the living room unasked, where he sat at one end of the sofa. She sat at the other, sipping her coffee.</p><p>She\u2019d turned off the movie, and the silence between them seemed to reverberate. Since he\u2019d been the one to arrive on her doorstep, Rachel figured he should speak first.</p><p>Eventually he did. \u201cI apologize for whatever I said or did this evening.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Sipped her coffee. He knew exactly what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me why you got so angry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d After admitting she\u2019d broken off her relationship with Nate, she\u2019d hoped, she\u2019d believed, he would declare his feelings. He hadn\u2019t, and now she understood why. If anything, he\u2019d gone out of his way to show her how little she meant to him.</p><p>\u201cIf I said something to offend you, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>Her back ramrod-straight, Rachel stared at the wall across from her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He looked uneasy, and there was another awkward moment of silence. \u201cI guess I should leave, then.\u201d He got to his feet, placing his cup on the coffee table.</p><p>Still clutching hers, Rachel walked him to the front entrance.</p><p>\u201cI miss being your friend,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t acknowledge his remark. Friend. Surrogate mother. Occasional dinner companion. All fine things but not enough.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Bruce,\u201d she said quietly and closed the door.</p><p>Thirty-Nine</p><p>Martha Evans\u2019s heirs had completed their search and made an official report; several pieces of expensive jewelry had gone missing. They\u2019d provided the sheriff\u2019s department with descriptions and Troy Davis had spent the morning gathering information. The first person he spoke to was Dave Flemming. The pastor had discovered the body and while he\u2019d had opportunity, he certainly didn\u2019t have motive.</p><p>Troy liked Dave and had never considered him a suspect. Once again, Dave had answered his questions in a forthright manner and, in fact, had made a real effort to be helpful. Troy appreciated that.</p><p>His other big case currently was the one involving Bobby Polgar and the alleged kidnapping. That now seemed to be under control.</p><p>He was in a good mood, and the main reason was Faith. At the end of the day, he\u2019d be seeing her again. They got together every week, either here or in Seattle. Tonight they were meeting halfway, at a restaurant in Tacoma.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t mentioned any of this to Megan yet. Yes, he was a coward. His daughter was having a hard time because of the miscarriage, and he wanted to give her a chance to heal, physically and emotionally, before he said anything about Faith. He wanted them to meet; Christmas would be perfect for that, he thought. Megan might not approve of a relationship so soon after Sandy\u2019s death, but once she got to know Faith, she\u2019d come to love her.</p> <p>Sitting back in his chair, he was reviewing the Evans case when one of the deputies knocked on his door.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter\u2019s here, Sheriff.\u201d</p><p>This was a surprise. \u201cBy all means, let her in,\u201d Troy said.</p><p>When Megan stepped into his office he saw immediately that something was wrong. She looked pale and shaken, her cheeks streaked with tears.</p><p>Troy came around his desk to guide her toward a chair. \u201cMegan, honey, what is it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem capable of speaking. Holding a damp, wadded-up tissue to her face, she took deep, shuddering breaths.</p><p>\u201cIs it Craig?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThe...miscarriage?\u201d</p><p>The mere mention of that made her close her eyes and grimace with pain. \u201cI...I went to the doctor this morning.\u201d</p><p>Fear shot through him. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Troy needed to sit down himself.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve thought of this. I\u2019ve been so oblivious. You, too, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOblivious to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Franklin wants me to have a test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of test?\u201d</p><p>She hiccuped a sob. \u201cDaddy,\u201d she whispered, her voice cracking with pain and fear. \u201cHe wants me to be tested for MS.\u201d</p><p>The shock of it slammed through him. Not once had he considered this. Not once. Realizing his daughter might be at risk for the disease that had robbed Sandy of a normal life\u2014it was almost too much to take in.</p><p>\u201cDr. Franklin explained that the cause is still unknown, but there might be a genetic factor. He...he said that women are more likely to get it and that statistically my chances are higher because Mom had it.\u201d</p><p>Troy could barely function, barely think. He\u2019d seen firsthand what Sandy had endured. Every day had presented new challenges. Every month Sandy had lost more ground. And while she faced it all with a hopeful spirit, in the end the disease had claimed her life. The thought of his only child going through that was more than Troy could tolerate.</p><p>\u201cHow am I supposed to tell Craig this?\u201d Megan asked, weeping openly now.</p><p>Troy couldn\u2019t answer her.</p><p>\u201cMom miscarried babies, too, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Still unable to find his voice, Troy nodded.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d rather be dead than go through what Mom did,\u201d Megan said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Troy jumped to his feet. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that!\u201d He wasn\u2019t easily frightened, but hearing Megan even suggest she\u2019d rather be dead filled him with shock and fear.</p><p>His daughter\u2019s weeping grew louder, and Troy thought his heart would break.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you be tested?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNext week. The doctor\u2019s scheduled an MRI, which he said is the most definitive means of making a diagnosis. He told me there\u2019s also a good chance I don\u2019t have it.\u201d She shredded the tissue in her hands. \u201cBut, Daddy, what if...\u201d</p><p>Troy couldn\u2019t deal with this. He couldn\u2019t accept that Megan, his only child, might have the same disease as Sandy.</p><p>Megan tried again. \u201cWhat if I do have MS?\u201d She tensed as she spoke the words. \u201cThe minute Dr. Franklin said I should be tested, certain things started to add up in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d Megan had always had an active imagination, and she could have built all of this up, exaggerated symptoms. It made sense. She\u2019d recently lost her mother and miscarried her first child. Little wonder she was distraught.</p><p>Megan went very quiet, as if formulating the best way to explain. \u201cMy eyes have been bothering me,\u201d she said.</p><p>A chill raced down Troy\u2019s spine. Shortly before they were married, Sandy had gone through a brief spell during which her eyes had given her trouble. The symptoms had disappeared and they\u2019d both attributed it to stress. Only later did they learn that problems like double vision could be an early sign of the disease. Of course, that\u2019d been nearly forty years ago, when much less was known about multiple sclerosis or its treatment.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get through this,\u201d Troy assured his daughter. \u201cWe will,\u201d he said fervently. \u201cYou and Craig and I.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him with anxious eyes, and he could see how much she wanted to believe him.</p><p>Troy wanted to believe it, too.</p><p>Before Megan left, they hugged for a long time. Later he noticed that his shirt was damp with her tears.</p><p>The possibility\u2014no matter how slight\u2014of Megan\u2019s having MS meant that his daughter needed him, and he had to be there for her, the same way he\u2019d been there for Sandy. It meant Troy would have to make changes in his life, and the biggest change involved his relationship with Faith.</p><p>Alone in his office he gazed, unseeing, out the window for an hour, trying to make sense of what was happening. He was in shock, and yet he felt that his thinking was completely clear. Before he could back down, he reached for his cell phone.</p><p>Faith answered right away. \u201cTroy! What a pleasant surprise.\u201d Generally, he didn\u2019t call in the middle of the day.</p><p>Her joy was like a knife piercing his heart. \u201cHello, Faith.\u201d Closing his eyes, Troy could hardly force himself to speak. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to see you tonight,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Troy, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d Her disappointment made his own that much sharper. But any relationship with him would be filled with broken dates and frustration. Megan had to be his priority. Being sheriff made constant demands on his time, as well. It wasn\u2019t fair to expect Faith to wait in the background or to settle for the occasional stolen minutes he could offer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019d never cancel a date for any frivolous reason.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll have to tell you my news over the phone,\u201d she said, \u201cinstead of waiting for this evening.\u201d</p><p>She remained irritatingly cheerful. \u201cWhat news?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve said something sooner, but I wanted it to be a surprise. I sold my house!\u201d</p><p>This was the last thing Troy wanted to hear. \u201cOh,\u201d he said flatly. He had no idea how he\u2019d cope with seeing Faith in town\u2014on the streets, in the stores, everywhere.</p><p>If she heard the reluctance in his voice, Faith ignored it. \u201cI should\u2019ve done this before now. It was ridiculous to live in such a huge place all by myself.\u201d</p><p>Troy said nothing.</p><p>\u201cMy son\u2019s thrilled,\u201d she went on to tell him. \u201cScottie\u2019s looking for a house for me. At least you and I won\u2019t be spending all our time on the road now,\u201d she added with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cFaith, listen, I\u2019ve been doing some thinking, and I\u2019ve decided it might not be wise to continue seeing each other.\u201d How he managed to get the words out, he didn\u2019t know. His heart screamed that he should stop. That he should withdraw the words, pretend he\u2019d never said them.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Bracing his hand against his forehead, he leaned his elbow on the desk.</p><p>A short pause followed his announcement.</p><p>\u201cHave I done something to upset you?\u201d Faith asked softly. If her joy had irritated him earlier, her pain left him raw.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen can I ask why you\u2019ve made this decision?\u201d</p><p>He thought about that, too, and how unjust he was being. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She took a moment to absorb his remark. \u201cI\u2019m not a teenage girl anymore, Troy. Our relationship went wrong all those years ago through no fault of ours. I don\u2019t want it to happen again. Now, please tell me what\u2019s wrong. I deserve to know that much.\u201d</p><p>She did, and he had to tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s Megan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter might have MS.\u201d</p><p>Faith gasped. \u201cOh, Troy. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never told her about you and I can\u2019t now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose you can,\u201d she agreed sadly.</p><p>\u201cWhen you move to Cedar Cove...\u201d He couldn\u2019t ask her not to move because it wasn\u2019t his right to do so. But at the same time, seeing her around town would be agony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve already made that decision, Troy. You were one reason, but there are others, including my son and his family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He closed his eyes in an effort to control his feelings. He loved Faith. He\u2019d loved her while they were in high school and he loved her now. Whether she lived in Seattle or Cedar Cove didn\u2019t matter. His love for her wasn\u2019t going to change.</p><p>\u201cIt might be best if you started seeing someone else,\u201d he said, disregarding the pain it caused him to say that.</p><p>Her lack of response filled him with dread. After a minute she said, \u201cIs that what you want, Troy? Do you really want me to see another man?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt might be best,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I understand why you feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Faith. I wish this had worked out for us, but it\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll be praying for you and your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>He thought he heard her swallow a sob. \u201cGoodbye, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Faith.\u201d</p><p>Forty</p><p>Linnette had been working for Buffalo Bob nearly two months now, and she had to admit she\u2019d grown attached to this town called BuffaloValley. The people were open and friendly, yet they respected her privacy and never asked questions she didn\u2019t want to answer. With one exception.</p><p>Pete Mason.</p><p>He\u2019d taken to dropping by 3 of a Kind for meals as often as two or three times a week\u2014which wouldn\u2019t bother her if all he did was eat. Oh, no, whenever he came to the restaurant, he made some remark or other about the things she\u2019d blurted out after the tornado. In fact, he didn\u2019t even seem to know he was embarrassing her with his rude comments.</p> <p>Once, he\u2019d actually brought her popcorn from the town\u2019s lone theater. The stuff dripped with so much melted butter that it leaked through the bag. He\u2019d presented it to her in front of half a dozen patrons, bowing low and making a spectacle of himself and consequently of her. All because she\u2019d casually mentioned one day that she liked popcorn.</p><p>Okay, Linnette was willing to confess that she ate the popcorn later\u2014alone in her room.</p><p>\u201cPete likes you,\u201d Merrily told her early on Saturday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it.\u201d This was a discussion Linnette didn\u2019t want to have. If Pete Mason was the slightest bit attracted to her, he would\u2019ve asked her out on a date by now. There\u2019d certainly been plenty of opportunities. He\u2019d shown more interest in the meat loaf and mashed potato special than in her. As far as she could tell, the only reason he made the long trek into town was so he could humiliate her with all the personal information she\u2019d revealed.</p><p>The Grange dance was coming up that evening and nearly everyone in town planned to attend. Because most people were going to be at the dance, Bob and Merrily were closing the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI bet Pete will be there tonight,\u201d Merrily said, shooting her a secretive little smile.</p><p>Linnette let that pass. She cleared away the dishes and wiped the counter. The breakfast hour had passed, and the number of customers wandering into the restaurant had slowed to a trickle. In the lull between breakfast and lunch, Linnette usually helped out in the kitchen, peeling potatoes, grating carrots, chopping onions\u2014anything Bob needed her to do. This job was temporary, she knew; still, she found she liked being around these people.</p><p>One blessing was that working as a waitress had taken her mind off Cal and Vicki, and for that she was grateful. She\u2019d heard from her mother that the two of them were going on another mustang rescue soon. Corrie had urged her to return to Cedar Cove, but Linnette had already made her decision and that was to stay in BuffaloValley.</p> <p>\u201cIs the restaurant open for Thanksgiving?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Merrily shook her head. \u201cMost folks prefer to be at home. BuffaloValley closes up tighter than a drum around the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be alone, you\u2019re welcome to join us,\u201d Merrily offered. \u201cWith three kids, it gets pretty hectic but there\u2019s always room for one more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Linnette said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ll do yet.\u201d</p><p>Merrily studied her. \u201cAre you homesick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t miss...some people?\u201d</p><p>Thanks to Pete Mason, half the town knew she\u2019d been jilted by the man she loved. Just thinking about the way he\u2019d betrayed her confidence made her seethe. She couldn\u2019t imagine what had possessed her to tell Pete the things she had.</p><p>Later, as Linnette dressed for the dance, which she\u2019d decided to attend, she thought about that conversation with Merrily. Surprisingly, she wasn\u2019t homesick. She missed her mother and father. Mack, too. And Gloria. Their frequent phone conversations helped.</p><p>As for her friends, they were few. Chad had written her a letter and updated her on what was happening at the clinic. He\u2019d also mentioned that he\u2019d talked Gloria into going to dinner with him.</p><p>Now that was news. Linnette had believed her sister might agree to a relationship once she was out of the picture. She didn\u2019t understand what the problem was, other than that Gloria seemed to think Linnette had some prior claim. While it was true that at one time she\u2019d had a crush on the doctor, she\u2019d been over him for ages.</p><p>When she did communicate with family and friends, no one referred to Cal. That was fine with her. Out of sight, out of mind was the old adage, and it had proved to be the case. She rarely thought of him these days, but if she did, the memory was accompanied by the same deep pain she\u2019d experienced when he\u2019d broken off their relationship.</p><p>The Grange Hall was on the outskirts of town. The parking lot was already crowded with pickup trucks of every model and style imaginable. In this part of the country, trucks and four-wheel-drive vehicles were a must and not a luxury. She\u2019d driven in with Buffalo Bob, Merrily and their kids, and when they\u2019d parked, she stood there for a moment, enjoying the crisp dark night and the music spilling out of the hall.</p><p>Merrily had lent her a pair of turquoise cowboy boots that were a good match for her three-quarter-length skirt. Her brown suede jacket was a nice touch, although fringe would\u2019ve made it perfect. All she needed to look like a bona fide local was a hat. If her family could see her now...</p><p>Linnette was astonished to find that she was actually considering a future in BuffaloValley. The town appealed to her, even if Pete Mason didn\u2019t. Although, he might if he wasn\u2019t so...so...She searched for the right word and couldn\u2019t think of one. Smart-mouthed? Rude? Presumptuous?</p><p>When Linnette had obtained her training as a Physician Assistant, she\u2019d hoped to work in a town exactly like BuffaloValley. Her original idea was to look in Montana or Wyoming, but her mother had been upset about her living so far from Washington. If Linnette had stuck with her plan, she might\u2019ve saved herself a great deal of heartache. In retrospect, North Dakota suited her very well indeed.</p><p>Linnette came into the hall with Bob and Merrily and removed her long winter coat, throwing it on a pile with the others. A temporary stage had been erected, where a fiddler, a piano player and a man with a banjo provided the entertainment. They were currently taking a break.</p><p>She gazed around, noticing that sawdust was sprinkled on the floor for dancing. The wooden tables on the left-hand side of the hall held homemade desserts and punch. Kids sat under them watching the adults.</p><p>On the far right, three rows of chairs had been set up for those who were more interested in visiting than dancing.</p><p>Linnette had never seen anything like this, had never been anywhere like this.</p><p>Shortly after they\u2019d taken off their coats, Buffalo Bob and Merrily left Linnette to join some of their friends. After an uncomfortable moment of hovering near the front entrance, Linnette sauntered over to the punch bowl and helped herself.</p><p>The music started again and before she\u2019d taken her first swallow of punch, three men were shouldering one another aside in an effort to reach her first.</p><p>\u201cWant to dance?\u201d Charley Dawson asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d DeWayne Block wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cIt was my idea,\u201d Brian Ledel insisted.</p><p>Linnette straightened. A girl could get used to this kind of treatment. \u201cI believe Charley asked me first,\u201d she said and, putting down her punch glass, offered him her hand. The band had just struck up a country waltz.</p><p>Linnette realized her mistake the third time Charley inadvertently stepped on her foot.</p><p>\u201cSorry...I\u2019m not much good at this dancing business,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing fine,\u201d she assured him and watched him mouth the words: one, two, three, one, two...</p><p>Even before the dance had finished, DeWayne Block was there to take his turn. Unfortunately, DeWayne seemed to have the same dance instructor as Charley. If this continued, she\u2019d be hobbling around with two bruised and possibly broken feet.</p><p>When Pete Mason showed up to claim a dance, she nearly protested that she was ready to sit one out. But that would mean he\u2019d escort her to the rows of chairs and stay with her. Linnette would rather endure another session of trampled toes than have Pete lean over to some stranger and expose another tidbit of her personal life.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Pete turned out to be an accomplished dancer. Not once did he come even close to stepping on her feet. More unexpected yet\u2014during the entire dance he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>With his jaw resting against her temple, he expertly whirled her about the room with moves Arthur Murray himself would\u2019ve approved. They might have been on a ballroom floor in New York City instead of a sawdust-covered Grange Hall on the prairies.</p><p>When the music ended, Pete released her with a brief bow. She blinked, viewing him with fresh eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you learn to dance like that?\u201d she asked. After all, the man was a farmer.</p><p>\u201cCollege,\u201d Pete said, obviously somewhat chagrined. \u201cThe dance class passed for a physical education elective, and I figured it was an easy A.\u201d He gave her a wry smile. \u201cI was wrong. I\u2019ve never worked harder for a grade in my life.\u201d</p><p>By unspoken agreement, they walked off the floor and over to the chairs. He sat down next to her and suddenly they were both ill-at-ease.</p><p>\u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give for another tornado,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>Linnette looked at him in shock. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d He stared straight ahead.</p><p>So did Linnette, until she saw her three earnest beaux heading in her direction. Her toes curled up in the fancy borrowed cowboy boots. If she danced with any of those cowboys again, she\u2019d be lucky if she could walk by the end of the evening.</p><p>Before DeWayne could reach her, Pete stood. Clasping her hand, he led her back onto the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cMy hero,\u201d Linnette whispered and felt his smile as he drew her into his arms. It was a slow dance, and she could hardly believe how well they synchronized their steps, almost as if they\u2019d been partners many times over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d she said as the music wound down.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSome remark intended to embarrass me.\u201d</p><p>Pete nearly missed a step. \u201cYeah, well, I could see that wasn\u2019t working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p> <p>She frowned at him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cAre you leaving BuffaloValley anytime soon? Because if you are, I\u2019d prefer to hear about it now.\u201d</p><p>The question startled her. The musicians declared another break, and they walked back to the seats they\u2019d previously occupied. When they were both sitting, Linnette turned to ask him, \u201cWhy should you care if I stay or if I go?\u201d</p><p>Pete folded his arms and glared at the floor. \u201cAre you planning to leave BuffaloValley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes flared wide. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m going to leave?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I figured a city girl like you probably wouldn\u2019t stick around for long.\u201d</p><p>This conversation was starting to get interesting. \u201cWhy do you want me to stay?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p><p>He stared back at her as though he resented the question. \u201cHave you noticed how many times I\u2019ve come into town in the last two months? We\u2019ve got an excellent cook out at the farmhouse, and my brother and I eat real well. The food at home is just as tasty as Buffalo Bob\u2019s. Maybe tastier.\u201d</p><p>In other words, Pete was telling her he\u2019d driven into town because of her.</p> <p>\u201cYou never asked me out,\u201d Linnette reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWith good reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI seem to remember you telling me you\u2019ve got a broken heart.\u201d He expelled his breath, then uncrossed his arms. \u201cI figured you needed time to get over this other guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...kay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I\u2019ve been coming to BuffaloValley so often? It\u2019s an hour\u2019s drive each way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a mind reader, Pete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to make sure no one else was showing any interest in you.\u201d</p> <p>Linnette nearly swallowed her tongue. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cWas that insulting? My brother, Josh, says I\u2019ll never convince a woman to marry me because I don\u2019t know when to keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re looking for a wife?\u201d This put a whole new twist on their conversation\u2014and on his behavior. Although if he wanted to get married, he was going about it in an odd way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not proposing,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cGood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. I\u2019m not even thinking about marriage.\u201d</p><p>Pete leaned forward, elbows on his knees. \u201cSo I\u2019m wasting my time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d Linnette murmured.</p><p>He glanced over at her. \u201cDepends on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Pete said, \u201cthat\u2019s fair. Can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk away.\u201d Linnette crossed her legs and swung one foot to the rhythm of the music.</p><p>\u201cWhat are my chances? Just tell me flat-out so I can save myself the time, effort and expense of driving back and forth. Not to mention making a fool of myself,\u201d he added in a low voice.</p><p>Linnette thought about his question. \u201cI can\u2019t really say. It would help if I knew more about you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d he said again. He paused, taking an audible breath. \u201cI run a farm with my brother. Josh isn\u2019t married, either.\u201d His eyes narrowed and he gave her an appraising look. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you have any unmarried friends who\u2019d be interested in moving here?\u201d As soon as the words were out, he seemed to regret having asked. \u201cNever mind. It worked once, but I don\u2019t think history\u2019s going to repeat itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight or nine years ago, Lindsay Snyder moved to town\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met Lindsay,\u201d she put in.</p><p>\u201cWell, her friend Maddy Washburn followed, and they married local men, so...Where was I?\u201d</p><p>Linnette froze. \u201cDid you say Washburn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It seemed Cal was destined to haunt her, no matter where she went.</p><p>\u201cShe married Jeb McKenna.\u201d</p><p>She and Maddy had become friends; Maddy was the person she\u2019d been planning to visit the day of the tornado. And Washburn was her maiden name. Life was full of such ironies, she supposed.</p><p>She saw Maddy\u2014no longer a Washburn\u2014and Lindsay Sinclair across the room, and the three of them exchanged waves. She turned back to Pete.</p><p>He seemed a bit flustered, so Linnette prompted him. \u201cYou were going to tell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Pete sat up a bit straighter. \u201cI\u2019m a farmer, just like my father and grandfather, and I work hard. We raise soybeans and wheat, and we keep a few horses. It isn\u2019t easy making a living off the land these days. Josh and I put in a lot of long hours. I enjoy reading in my spare time, and as you noticed, I\u2019m not bad on my feet. I can play a little guitar and I\u2019m fond of kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kind to animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m too softhearted, according to my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any secrets you\u2019re willing to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the ones I spilled during the tornado.\u201d</p><p>Pete frowned. \u201cI cheated on a test once in seventh grade and I\u2019ve felt guilty about it ever since. The first time I chewed tobacco my dad walked into the room and I swallowed it. I ended up sicker than a dog and I haven\u2019t chewed since.\u201d</p><p>That was a comforting thought. He was obviously a man who learned from his mistakes.</p><p>\u201cAnything else you want to ask me?\u201d While she mulled over the question, Pete said, \u201cI know that if I was ever fortunate enough to have a woman like you fall in love with me, I\u2019d recognize and treasure the gift I had and never look elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted at that. \u201cI\u2019d say your chances just went up considerably, Pete Mason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did?\u201d</p><p>She smiled and found he was smiling, too. Oh, yes, Buffalo Valley, North Dakota, was looking better all the time.</p><p>Forty-One</p><p>Teri knew that Bobby was as ready as he could possibly be for this all-important chess match. The two top-ranked chess players in the world would finally meet, and the press was watching carefully.</p><p>Although he wasn\u2019t pleased about her accompanying him to New York, Teri had insisted on it. James was still at home in Cedar Cove, recovering. Teri had asked Christie if she\u2019d look in on him while they were away. Christie had agreed, but reluctantly; when she got back, Teri was going to do a little probing. That relationship seemed to be one step forward, twenty steps back, and neither of them was telling her anything.</p><p>The match, in midtown Manhattan, would be broadcast around the globe. The New York Times had published an article about the elusive Bobby Polgar; the reporter claimed that since his marriage, Bobby had gone into seclusion and had finally emerged.</p><p>On the flight from Seattle, Teri wore a maternity top for the first time. She didn\u2019t really need it yet, but she figured her pregnancy would give the press something to talk about\u2014and an ostensible reason for Bobby\u2019s disappearance from public view.</p><p>They arrived in Manhattan on Saturday afternoon. The match would be staged at a hotel off Broadway the next day. When they entered their suite, Teri was awestruck by the huge bouquets of flowers, fruit baskets and bottles of champagne. This was her first trip to New York, and it was everything she\u2019d expected. Staring out the window at the streets below, she lingered over the dazzling lights of the city. This was some kind of town! Mesmerized, she could hear its heartbeat from thirty-eight floors up.</p><p>\u201cBobby, will you look at this?\u201d she cried, holding back the draperies and fixing her gaze on the blur of yellow taxis. The billboards flashed advertisements and vendors hawked their wares on street corners.</p><p>\u201cI want to shop,\u201d Teri said longingly. She had a total of two maternity tops in her entire wardrobe. Two. And New York was supposed to have some of the best shopping in the whole world.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bobby said without even a pause.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Bobby said it to her so rarely that it was like hearing a foreign language.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he promised.</p><p>She sighed; he was right. Teri\u2019s role now was to support Bobby. After the match there\u2019d be plenty of time to hit the stores. \u201cWill you come with me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Bobby nodded. \u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun,\u201d she said. Flopping down on the bed, she reached for the room-service menu and flipped through the pages, exclaiming at the selection and the prices.</p><p>The match was to be played at nine on Sunday morning, and Bobby seemed far more relaxed than she was. She\u2019d assumed they\u2019d stay in the hotel, eat their meals there and wait until it was time for Bobby to face the Russian.</p><p>Instead, he suggested they go for a walk. Teri readily agreed. When she\u2019d met her husband the year before, he\u2019d lived in New York in a condo apartment somewhere close to Central Park. She\u2019d never seen his place; after they\u2019d bought the house on Seaside Avenue</p><p>, Bobby had sold the apartment.</p><p>Outside, the streets were crowded with people of all ages, all backgrounds, all nationalities. There was an almost electric energy, unlike anything Teri had ever experienced. Her eyes darted in every direction and more than once Bobby had to pull her away from street vendors.</p><p>\u201cI can buy a designer purse for thirty bucks,\u201d she cried in protest, glancing over her shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t you know what a bargain that is?\u201d</p><p>Bobby shook his head. \u201cThey aren\u2019t authentic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want a purse, I\u2019ll get you a real one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBobby...\u201d</p><p>Her husband refused to listen. Maybe later she\u2019d sneak out and buy some for Rachel and Christie\u2014they\u2019d be thrilled. But, regardless of her disappointment from a shopping perspective, Teri found the walk invigorating. They\u2019d eaten dinner in a genuine New York deli, and she was determined to find a cheesecake recipe to duplicate the fabulous dessert they\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to watch a movie?\u201d she asked when they got back to the room. They could order one on their own television set. She could\u2019ve watched movies the week they\u2019d honeymooned in Vegas, too, only they had better things to do. But this evening, it was far more important that Bobby relax and get a good night\u2019s sleep.</p><p>\u201cA movie?\u201d he asked, sounding puzzled.</p><p>\u201cThey have a whole list here. We don\u2019t even have to leave the room.\u201d</p><p>Bobby grinned. \u201cI have my own methods of relaxation.\u201d</p><p>He wore the expression she knew so well. \u201cBobby! Tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one thing, you\u2019ve got the biggest match of your life in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He walked over to the door, turned the lock and slid the chain into place. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Teri felt it was only fair to warn him. \u201cIn a few months I\u2019m going to be big and fat and you won\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an odd look. \u201cI will always want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bobby.\u201d</p><p>They went to bed early that night but didn\u2019t fall asleep until late.</p> <p>The next morning, Bobby showed none of the pretournament jitters she\u2019d seen before. He woke, showered and dressed in his usual shirt and pants, nothing special, no \u201clucky\u201d outfit. Then he ordered coffee and Irish oatmeal for breakfast.</p><p>Teri wore her brand-new maternity top and turned sideways to check her reflection in the closet-door mirror. \u201cCan you tell I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d she asked plaintively.</p><p>Bobby studied her, tilting his head to one side. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want people to think I\u2019m just fat,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cThey will see that you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>If he didn\u2019t stop saying that, she was going to start crying. Bobby might not be movie-star handsome, but he had more heart and brains than anyone she\u2019d ever met or hoped to meet. She continually felt grateful\u2014and somewhat astonished\u2014that he loved her.</p><p>As soon as they appeared at the tournament headquarters, on the hotel\u2019s penthouse level, a hush fell over the room. In the world of chess, her husband was the reigning king. Yet he never put on airs or pretensions, never expected special treatment or deference.</p><p>Bobby escorted her to the viewing area, where Teri was given a prominent seat. She noticed television cameras and several monitors placed throughout the room.</p><p>When the Russian player, Aleksandr Vladimir, arrived it was with a grand flourish. He paused by the door, as if waiting for applause before he deigned to enter. When a few people clapped, he gave a slight bow, then removed his black overcoat and draped it over the arm of the burly man on his right.</p><p>Cameras flashed.</p><p>Reporters buzzed with questions.</p> <p>Just a minute. Teri narrowed her eyes as she recognized the husky man beside the Russian. He was the one who\u2019d cornered her in the parking lot outside the mall that night last spring. He might even be one of the men who\u2019d abducted Rachel and James.</p><p>Of all the nerve!</p><p>The despicable Vladimir had the audacity to show up with this...this goon! And she was supposed to ignore the fact that he\u2019d threatened her? She\u2019d have to have a little chat with New York\u2019s finest, she thought grimly.</p><p>She forced herself to calm down as Bobby and the Russian sat across from each other at the chessboard. A sports commentator for one of the major networks made the introductions, then lowered his voice as he explained to the television viewing audience the importance of this match.</p><p>Last night Bobby had described his strategy to her\u2014how he planned to outwit the Russian. She\u2019d nodded at what she assumed were all the right moments, but didn\u2019t understand much of what he said.</p><p>Teri watched each move intently. Bobby had demonstrated the first eight moves Vladimir was likely to make and how he\u2019d respond. It was the next three that would set up the trap. The trap Vladimir had prearranged so Bobby would lose the match and he\u2019d walk away victorious.</p><p>With the ninth move, Bobby did as he\u2019d been told. The crowd grew silent, then Teri heard scattered murmuring. The Black Hole. Bobby had stepped into the Black Hole. The Russian seemed to be stunned, and Teri had to compliment him on his fine acting job.</p><p>She clenched her fists at her sides.</p> <p>Aleksandr looked cocky as he made his move.</p><p>Bobby stared at the board as if he\u2019d been outplayed.</p><p>According to what Bobby had explained, there were eleven moves before the game was lost, with a few possible variations. Bobby made his tenth move. Vladimir executed his, doing exactly as her husband had predicted. Bobby followed. Vladimir smiled triumphantly into the camera and executed his next move.</p><p>At that point, Bobby nodded and slipped his own pawn into position.</p><p>Vladimir frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou said eleven moves,\u201d Bobby told him. The microphone picked up the exchange.</p><p>The Russian didn\u2019t speak. He hesitated for a few seconds, then moved again.</p><p>Once again, a hush fell over the room, and the commentator spoke excitedly into the microphone, explaining that the audience was viewing chess history. For the first time ever, a player had maneuvered himself out of the Black Hole. Whether Bobby Polgar won the match or not, history had been made.</p><p>In the end, Bobby did win the match, even though he\u2019d obeyed Vladimir\u2019s instructions.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The big Russian leaped to his feet and swore loudly, causing several people to gasp. \u201cYou were supposed to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what you said,\u201d Bobby reminded him. \u201cYou said I had to play the first eleven moves of the Black Hole, which I did. I followed your instructions to the letter.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Teri saw two uniformed police officers enter the room and step forward. They walked directly up to the burly man Teri had recognized earlier. A moment later, two other policemen came in; they marched toward the stage and arrested Vladimir, charging him with fraud and conspiracy to\u2014Teri couldn\u2019t hear the rest, but she fervently hoped kidnapping and assault charges were on the list.</p><p>Bobby was instantly surrounded by reporters. The television cameras followed him as he left the stage and walked toward Teri. Questions were tossed at him from every direction, but Bobby ignored them all. When he reached her, she practically threw herself into his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou were incredible!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Polgar, Mrs. Polgar, were you aware of the threat against you?\u201d</p><p>She beamed the reporters a smile. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d Then, because she wanted them to know she was pregnant, she placed her hand on her stomach. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Polgar! Mrs. Polgar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI married the most brilliant man in the universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you plan to teach your child to play chess?\u201d one reporter asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Bobby said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, we will,\u201d Teri insisted.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d the commentator called. \u201cI can answer your questions about the match and explain what just happened.\u201d</p><p>The reporters turned toward the other man.</p><p>Before she could say any more, Bobby grabbed her hand. He led her out of the hall and, together with the security people, they were directed to a special elevator and escorted to their suite, where even more flowers had been delivered, along with more champagne.</p><p>As soon as they were alone, Teri flung her arms around Bobby. \u201cHave I told you how attractive your brain is?\u201d she asked, covering his face with kisses.</p><p>\u201cAh-h, no.\u201d His glasses were askew.</p><p>\u201cI am so crazy in love with you that it\u2019s all I can do not to tear off my clothes and make love to you right this minute.\u201d</p><p>Bobby\u2019s eyes flared as a smile broke out.</p><p>\u201cYou arranged everything, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He answered her with a slight nod. \u201cSheriff Davis and I worked it out. He talked to the New York City police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me Vladimir would pay for what he did to Rachel and James.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will pay in prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where he deserves to be.\u201d Teri laughed. Taking hold of his shirt collar, she brought him close enough to nibble on his bottom lip.</p><p>Bobby started to unfasten the buttons on his shirt. \u201cI might bring you to more chess tournaments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that idea.\u201d She eased him toward the bed until he lost his balance and they fell on top of it.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Bobby,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Forty-Two</p><p>Monday evening, after she\u2019d finished her housework and folded the last clothes from the dryer, Rachel sat in front of the television. Her thoughts weren\u2019t on the game show, however; she couldn\u2019t even have said what it was. For the past week, she\u2019d done her best not to think about the muddle her life had become since she\u2019d broken up with Nate. All her fears about Bruce had proved to be accurate. She hadn\u2019t heard from him since their last awkward conversation. Nor had Jolene contacted her.</p><p>The only thing she was happy about was Bobby Polgar\u2019s success at the chess match in New York\u2014and Aleksandr Vladimir\u2019s arrest. That was truly satisfying. She wondered whether she\u2019d have to testify; if so, she\u2019d certainly be willing.</p><p>The phone rang, startling her. Rachel half expected it to be Teri, who was still in New York.</p><p>Caller ID informed her it was Bruce. Or Jolene.</p><p>\u201cHi, Rachel,\u201d Jolene said excitedly. \u201cI\u2019m baking a cake and we only have one egg and the recipe says I need three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdd two extra tablespoons of water,\u201d Rachel advised her.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The girl seemed about to hang up when she said, \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to you in a whole week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve missed you, Jolene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too. Oh, can you hold on a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Rachel could hear Bruce talking in the background.</p><p>Then Jolene was back on the line. \u201cDad would like to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her heart started to pound.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Bruce said. His voice was unusually hoarse, and she wondered if he had a cold.</p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d He cleared his throat.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><p>Rachel kept waiting for him to tell her why he\u2019d wanted to speak to her. \u201cSo Jolene\u2019s baking a cake,\u201d she said when she couldn\u2019t stand the silence for one more second. \u201cAny particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. She said she was in a baking mood.\u201d</p><p>Another silence. She was tempted to get off the phone.</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned something the other day, and I wasn\u2019t sure I heard you correctly,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell me you\u2019re not seeing Nate anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>Under no circumstance was she going to admit to loving him, especially when he\u2019d been so obtuse.</p><p>\u201cPersonally, I think you\u2019re making a mistake. I think you should marry Nate.\u201d</p><p>What? Rachel blinked with shock. \u201cFine, maybe I will. Thank you so much for your helpful advice. I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d With that she slammed down the receiver.</p><p>The phone rang again. Again, Caller ID told her it was Bruce. She had no intention of picking up. As the answering machine came on, his voice resounded in the room. \u201cRachel, I know you\u2019re there. Come on, be reasonable, would you?\u201d</p><p>She turned and shouted back, \u201cNo, I will not!\u201d</p><p>She had to get out. Grabbing her purse, she was halfway to her car when she realized she\u2019d been so furious with Bruce she\u2019d forgotten her coat. By the time she\u2019d unlocked the house, retrieved her coat and climbed inside her vehicle, she saw Bruce\u2019s car turn the corner. She sped away and prayed he hadn\u2019t seen her.</p><p>No such luck. Not only did he see her, he followed her into the Safeway lot. He parked two cars over, and left his car the same moment she did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy are you mad at me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Rachel ignored him and hurried toward the store, as intent as if she were gathering provisions before a snowstorm.</p><p>Bruce refused to give up. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what I said that was so horrible,\u201d he said, trotting beside her. \u201cNate Olsen would be a good husband for you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t deign to reply.</p> <p>\u201cHe loves you.\u201d</p><p>She continued to ignore him and seized a cart at the outside entrance to the store.</p><p>\u201cNate has connections and money and prestige.\u201d Bruce collected a cart of his own.</p><p>She\u2019d had enough. Whirling around to face him, she demanded an answer. \u201cWhy did you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny of those times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d She shoved her cart past him and noticed that the other shoppers moved quickly out of her way. Apparently these strangers recognized the mood she was in. Bruce, unfortunately, didn\u2019t seem to.</p><p>As she tore down the aisle, Rachel tossed in items, although she had no idea what they were or if she needed them. Bruce was right behind her at the checkout stand.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished paying, he abandoned his empty cart and reached for her groceries. \u201cI\u2019ll carry these for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m capable of taking out my own groceries.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are.\u201d He walked out of the store, hauling her three bags.</p><p>Rachel had no other choice but to follow him. When she got to her car, Bruce was standing there, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly evident that we need to talk,\u201d he said calmly.</p><p>Rachel glared at him in response. \u201cAll right. What do you want to say?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she asked, folding her arms.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to marry Nate. In fact, I\u2019m convinced it would be the wrong thing for everyone involved\u2014including me. Especially me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know what I said, and I didn\u2019t mean a word of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why say it?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head mournfully. \u201cBecause in every way that counts, Lover Boy is the better man.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother chastising him for the derogatory nickname; it didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><p>\u201cBetter than whom?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>That caught him up short. For a moment Bruce didn\u2019t respond. When he did, his back was straight and his fists clenched. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d She dropped her arms. It\u2019d taken him long enough to get to the point.</p><p>He inhaled sharply. \u201cI love you, Rachel. I don\u2019t know when it happened. All I know is how I feel. If you married Nate, it would devastate me. Not just Jolene. Me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I broke up with him.\u201d She also remembered his reaction. Zilch. Zero. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy did you break up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the night I was kidnapped, I realized I was in love with you. I was afraid I was going to die, and it was you I thought about. It wasn\u2019t Nate.\u201d</p><p>He took one step toward her. \u201cThen why are we fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when I told you I\u2019d broken up with Nate, you...you acted like you didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>He blinked. \u201cI...did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I was afraid to believe it was true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe you don\u2019t know what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes I do,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, and I have been for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, unsure she could trust him. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you holding me?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMainly because I\u2019m loaded down with these bags.\u201d</p><p>Rachel promptly unlocked her car door and as soon as Bruce had set the groceries aside, she was in his arms. Then he was kissing her, and it was every bit as good as that night at the Taco Shack. No, better. She hadn\u2019t thought that was possible.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he whispered over and over. \u201cI was so afraid I\u2019d lose you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel had been afraid, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of long engagements,\u201d Bruce told her. He kissed her again, deeper this time. His kisses were filled with meaning, with joy and anticipation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Bruce, I can\u2019t believe you really love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it. I think I always knew,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut the night you were kidnapped made it completely clear.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThat Russian chess player actually did us both a favor.\u201d His arms tightened around her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Rachel murmured.</p><p>\u201cAfter Stephanie was killed, I didn\u2019t think I could ever love another woman. But I do, Rachel. I love you. I can\u2019t impress you with a big diamond or a fancy house. I\u2019m just a regular kind of guy trying to make a living and raise my daughter. I\u2019ve been alone for years, but I don\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\u201d</p><p>Rachel didn\u2019t, either. She\u2019d been lost, adrift, afraid. For the first time since her mother\u2019s death, when Rachel was nine years old, she had a family.</p><p>Emily Flemming sat down at the piano in the church sanctuary. She poised her hands above the keys. In quiet moments like this, she enjoyed playing the piano and singing hymns. They brought her a feeling of peace.</p><p>Dave was due back at the church soon. He was on one of his routine calls to shut-ins. Her husband had a strong sense of responsibility and an equally strong sense of compassion. Being married to a minister wasn\u2019t easy; the demands on Dave took him away from the family five or six nights a week. Lately, he\u2019d been gone even later and longer than usual. When he returned to the house, their sons were always fast asleep, and Dave would be mentally and physically exhausted. That was one reason she was looking forward to a relaxing evening. It was their anniversary, and they were going to D.D.\u2019s on the Cove.</p><p>After she\u2019d been playing and singing for about thirty minutes, her voice grew tired and she decided to wait for Dave in the church office.</p><p>When she got there, Angel, the church secretary, was shutting down her computer for the evening. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be back any minute,\u201d the middle-aged woman said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will, too.\u201d Dave had promised to take her out for dinner before he met with the Finance Committee to work on the church budget for next year.</p><p>She was afraid moving to 8 Sandpiper Way earlier in the year had strained the family\u2019s already tight budget. Emily blamed herself; she\u2019d seen the house and fallen in love with it. Despite her protests that they couldn\u2019t afford a new home, Dave had insisted on buying it for her. She loved him all the more for it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait inside his office,\u201d Emily said as Angel gathered up her things. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to stay.\u201d</p><p>Angel hesitated. \u201cGary and I are going to a movie with friends tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Emily said, waving her out the door.</p><p>Wandering around her husband\u2019s office, Emily looked at the books in his bookcase and the objects on his desk. He seemed to accumulate books the way some women did shoes.</p><p>His favorite jacket hung on the door. Apparently he\u2019d forgotten it at the office this morning. Taking it off the hook, she draped it over her arm and then heard something hit the floor. Whatever it was rolled beneath the desk.</p><p>Getting down on all fours, Emily discovered a woman\u2019s earring. It looked expensive. Diamonds? She checked the pocket; there wasn\u2019t another one. If this was a surprise anniversary gift, then there\u2019d obviously be two. They\u2019d be in a jeweler\u2019s box as well. These were elaborate and somewhat old-fashioned\u2014certainly not her style. Dave would know that.</p><p>An eerie sensation came over her. Surely Dave wasn\u2019t seeing another woman. He couldn\u2019t be\u2014could he? Her mind flashed back on the last few months, and she was startled to realize that their love life wasn\u2019t what it had once been. When had this happened? Six months ago? A year?</p><p>She suddenly grew cold as she recalled a recent visit by Sheriff Troy Davis. He\u2019d come to question Dave about Martha Evans and her missing jewelry. Could this earring have belonged to the wealthy old woman? There was a sick feeling in the pit of her stomach.</p><p>She heard the church door open. \u201cEmily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Dave,\u201d she called.</p><p>Hurriedly shoving the earring in her purse, Emily forced a smile and went out to greet her husband. As she did, she wondered for the first time in her life if she really knew this man. </p> </body></html>"]
