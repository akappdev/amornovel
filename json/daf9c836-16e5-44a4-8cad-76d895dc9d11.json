My back ached. My stiff green canvas apron was chafing my neck. And one of the Glisson twins had dropped a gallon jar of mayo on my big toe earlier. I hadn\u2019t been this exhausted since doing an emergency rotation during my medical residency. The only nice thing I could say about working at Emerson\u2019s was that the owner hadn\u2019t asked for photo identification when I applied, eliminating an awful lot of worry for my undocumented self. Also, I usually dealt with less blood.</p> <p>Unless, of course, I did bludgeon Gordie with the ham, which would result in a serious amount of cleanup in aisle five.</p><p>I only had a few more weeks of checkout duty before I would be moving on, winding my way toward Anchorage. It was just easier that way. Now that I was living in what I called \u201cthe gray zone,\u201d I knew there was a maximum amount of time people could spend around me before they resented unanswered personal questions. Of course, I\u2019d also learned a few other things, like how to make an emergency bra or patch a pair of shoes with duct tape. And now I was trying to learn the zen art of not bashing an indecisive cornflake lover over the head with preserved pork products.</p><p>I glanced back to Gordie, who was now considering his oatmeal options.</p><p>I swore loudly enough to attract the attention of my peroxide-blond fellow retail service engineer Belinda. Middle-aged, pear-shaped, and possessing a smoker\u2019s voice that put that Exorcist kid to shame, Belinda was the assistant manager at Emerson\u2019s, the closest thing to a retail mecca in McClusky, a tiny ditchwater town on the easternmost border of Alaska. Because I was still a probationary employee, I wasn\u2019t allowed to close up on my own. But Belinda was friendly and seemed eager to make me a \u201clifer\u201d at Emerson\u2019s like herself. I suspected she wasn\u2019t allowed to retire until she found a replacement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known Gordie for almost forty years. He can make a simple decision feel like the end of Sophie\u2019s Choice,\u201d she said, putting a companionable arm around me as I slumped against my counter. It was an accomplishment that I was able to give her a little squeeze in return.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about throwing one of those canned hams at him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve made that threat before, huh?\u201d</p><p>Belinda snickered at my irritated tone. I glared at her. She assured me, \u201cI\u2019m laughing with you, Anna, not at you.\u201d</p><p>I offered her a weak but genuine smile. \u201cFeels the same either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go on home, hon?\u201d Belinda suggested. \u201cI know you worked a double when that twit Haley called in sick. For the third time this week, I might add. I\u2019ll close up. You go get some food in you. You\u2019re looking all pale and sickly again.\u201d</p><p>I sighed again, smiling at her. When I\u2019d first arrived at Emerson\u2019s, Belinda had taken one look at my waxy cheeks and insisted on sending me home with a \u201csigning-bonus box\u201d of high-calorie, high-protein foods. I was sucking down protein shakes and Velveeta for a week. Every time I put a pound on my short, thin frame, she considered it a personal victory. I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell her that my pallor wasn\u2019t from malnutrition but from stress and sleep deprivation. I gave her another squeeze. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sleeping well, that\u2019s all. Thanks. I owe you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you do,\u201d she said as I whipped my green Emerson\u2019s apron over my head and stuffed it into my bag. As I made my way to the employee locker room, I heard her yell, \u201cDamn it, Gordie, it\u2019s just Cream of Wheat. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re pulling somebody\u2019s plug!\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, I slipped out the back through the employee exit, waiting for the slap of frigid September air to steal my breath. I snuggled deeper into my thick winter jacket, grateful for its insulating warmth. Years before, when I\u2019d first arrived in Alaska, I\u2019d brought only the barest essentials. I\u2019d spent most of my cross-state drive shivering so hard I could barely steer. Eager to help me acclimate, my new neighbors had taken great pains to help me select the most sensible jacket, the most reasonably priced all-weather boots. I missed those neighbors with a bone-deep ache that I couldn\u2019t blame on the cold. I missed the people who had become my family. I missed the valley I\u2019d made home. The thought of trying to make a place for myself all over again tipped my exhaustion into full-on despair.</p><p>Fumbling with the keys to my powder-blue-and-rust Pinto, I heard someone say, \u201cJust tell Jake I\u2019ll get him the money in a week.\u201d</p><p>A gruffer, calmer voice answered, \u201cMarty, relax. Jake didn\u2019t send me. I just stopped in for a burger. I\u2019m not here for you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, hoping to block out the shadowy forms in the far corner of the employee lot that Emerson\u2019s shared with the Wishy-Washy Laundromat and Flapjack\u2019s Saloon. I didn\u2019t want to see any of this. I didn\u2019t want the liability of witnessing some sort of criminal transaction. I just wanted to go home to my motel room and stand in the shower until I no longer felt the pain of sixteen hours and a jumbo jar of mayonnaise on my feet. I turned my back to the voices, struggling to work the sticky lock on my driver\u2019s-side door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feed me that bullshit,\u201d the reedier, slightly whiny voice countered. \u201cHe sent you after me when I owed him ten. You don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to do it again now that I owe him seventeen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m not here for you. But if you don\u2019t put that gun away, I might change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Gun? Did he say \u201cgun\u201d?</p> <p>Who the hell has a gunfight in the parking lot behind a Laundromat?</p><p>I focused on keeping my hands from shaking as I jiggled the key in the lock. Stupid circa-1980s tumbler technology! I gave myself another five seconds to open the door before I would just run back to the Emerson\u2019s employee entrance.</p><p>That was my plan, until the point when I heard the gunshot . . . and the screech of tires . . . and the roar of an engine coming way too close. I turned just in time to see the back end of a shiny black SUV barreling toward me and my car. I took three steps before throwing myself into the bed of a nearby pickup truck. Even before I peered over the lip of the bed, I knew the loud, tortured metallic squeal was the SUV pulverizing my Pinto.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I cried, watching as my car disintegrated in front of my very eyes.</p><p>The SUV struggled to disengage its back end from the wreckage of my now-inoperable car. As the driver gunned the engine, I followed the beams of the headlights across the lot to a man curled in the fetal position on the ground.</p><p>My eyes darted back and forth between the injured man and the growling black vehicle. This was none of my business. I didn\u2019t know this guy. I didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done to make Mr. SUV want to run him down like a dog. And despite the fact that every instinct told me to stay put, stay down until this guy was a little man-pancake, I launched myself out of the truck bed and ran across the lot. I dashed toward the hunched form on the ground, sliding on the gravel when I bent to help him. I tamped down my instincts to keep him still while I assessed the damage, assuring myself that any wounds he had would definitely prove fatal if he was run over by a large vehicle.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d I shouted as the SUV wrenched free of my erstwhile transportation and lurched toward us.</p><p>Mr. Pancake-to-Be struggled to his knees. I tucked my arms under his sleeves and pulled, my arms burning with the effort to lift him off the ground.</p><p>\u201cGet your butt off the concrete, now!\u201d I grunted, heaving him out of the path of the SUV. I felt a set of car keys dangling out of his jacket pocket. I clicked the fob button until I heard a beep and turned toward the noise.</p><p>Just as I got him on his feet, the headlights of the SUV flared. We stumbled forward, falling between his truck and Belinda\u2019s hatchback. The hatchback shuddered with a tortured metallic shriek as the SUV sideswiped it. I jerked the passenger door of the truck open, slid across the seat, and dragged him inside. When I pulled it back, my hand was red and slick with blood. He groaned as he tried to fold his long legs into the cab. I reached over him to slam the door.</p><p>\u201cNot smart,\u201d I mumbled, slipping the key into the ignition. \u201cLike \u2018and she was never heard from again\u2019 not smart.\u201d</p><p>I watched as the SUV careened off the far corner of the lot into the grass. The ground was soupy and particularly fragrant, thanks to a septic-tank leak. The owner of Flapjack\u2019s had warned us not to park anywhere near it, or we\u2019d end up stuck to our axles in substances best not imagined, which is what was happening to the SUV the more it spun its wheels. I glanced between my demolished car and the guy who seemed so hell-bent on killing my passenger. At this point, I didn\u2019t know which was more distressing. The SUV driver stepped out, slipping and sliding in the muck that had sucked him in to the ankles. There was a flash of metal in his hand as he strode toward the truck. A gun. He was pointing a gun at us.</p><p>Fortunately for me and my barely conscious passenger, the SUV guy wandered a little too close to my Pinto. And my rusted-out baby, being the most temperamentally explosive of all makes and models, had not taken kindly to being squished by the big, mean off-roader. My notoriously delicate gas tank was leaking fuel all over the parking lot, dangerously close to the lard bucket Flapjack\u2019s set out back to catch employees\u2019 cigarette butts. And because the saloon was staffed by likable though lazy people, there were always a few smoldering butts lying around on the gravel.</p><p>WHOOSH.</p><p>The fuel ignited, sending my car up like a badly upholstered Roman candle. Mr. SUV was thrown to the ground as a little mushroom cloud exploded over us.</p><p>Good. Explosions drew a lot of attention. People would come running out to see what had happened, and Mr. SUV couldn\u2019t afford that many witnesses. This guy would get the (fully equipped) medical attention he needed . . . and I would end up answering questions for a lot of cops.</p><p>Not good.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d punched the gas before I felt the gravel give way under the tires and the truck lurch toward the open road.</p><p>He slumped against the window as I careened out of the parking lot and onto the highway. The closest medical facility was in Bernard, about seventy miles up the road. As we neared the town limits, I passed the Lucky Traveler Motel, wishing we had time to stop and pick up my clothes and medical bag. But nearly everyone in the bar knew where I lived. The SUV driver would only have to ask a few people in the crowd that gathered to roast marshmallows around my immolated car and he\u2019d find me in about ten minutes. For that matter, he could have been following us at that moment. Somehow, that made my spare contact-lens case and stethoscope seem less significant.</p><p>\u201cMister?\u201d I said, shaking his shoulder, wincing as I noticed the blood seeping through his shirt. Gunshot wounds to the abdomen usually meant perforated major organs and damaged blood vessels, but his blood loss was minimal. I held out hope, though I knew that wasn\u2019t necessarily a good sign. There could be some complication or an exit wound I wasn\u2019t aware of. I pulled my apron out of my bag and pressed the green canvas against his belly. He groaned, opening his burnt-chocolate eyes and blinking at me, as if he was trying to focus on my face but couldn\u2019t quite manage it.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, squinting at me. \u201cI know you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, focusing on the situation at hand instead of the instinctual panic those words sent skittering up my spine. \u201cNo, I\u2019d remember you, I\u2019m sure. Just hold on, OK? I\u2019m going to get you to the clinic in Bernard. Do you think you could stay awake for me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo doctors.\u201d</p><p>I supposed this would be a bad time to tell him I was a doctor.</p><p>\u201cNot that bad. No doctors,\u201d he ground out, glaring at me. I scowled right back. His face split into a loopy smirk. \u201cPretty.\u201d</p><p>His head thunked back against the seat rest, which I supposed signaled the end of our facial-expression standoff.</p><p>And now that I had time to study said face, I could appreciate the shaggy black hair, eyes so intensely brown they were almost black, and cheekbones carved from granite. His lips were wide and generous and probably pretty tempting when they weren\u2019t curled back over his teeth in pain like that.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he moaned, batting his hand against my shoulder, weakly flexing his fingers around it.</p><p>Well, damn, I\u2019d always been a sucker for a man who kept pretty manners intact while bleeding. \u201cFine,\u201d I shot back. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d already passed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd she was never heard from again,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>A few miles later, my passenger stopped bleeding, which could mean that he\u2019d started to clot . . . or that he\u2019d gone into shock and died. My optimism had reached its limit for the evening.</p><p>Keeping an eye on the road, I pressed my fingers over his carotid and detected a slow but steady pulse. I took a deep breath and tried to focus. I\u2019d been through so much worse. It didn\u2019t make sense to panic now. How had I gotten myself into this? I\u2019d worked so hard to avoid this kind of trouble. I\u2019d kept my head down, stayed low profile. And here I was, driving around in a possibly stolen truck with a possibly dead body slumped over in the passenger seat. If I\u2019d had one operating brain cell in my head, I would have run screaming into the bar the minute I heard the men arguing in the parking lot. But no, I had to help the injured stray, because living with the less-than-civic-minded side of humanity over the last few years had apparently taught me nothing.</p><p>I saw a sign ahead for Sharpton. Since he didn\u2019t want to go to the clinic, I\u2019d turned off the main highway and stuck to the older, less-traveled state routes. I tapped the brakes, afraid I would miss some vital piece of information hidden between the words \u201cSharpton\u201d and \u201c20 miles.\u201d As the truck slowed, the big guy slumped forward and snorted as his head smacked against the dashboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Good. Dead people do not snort. That was my qualified medical opinion.</p><p>\u201cHey, big guy?\u201d I said loudly, shaking his shoulder. \u201cMister?\u201d</p><p>He snorted again but did not wake up. I laughed, practically crying with relief. I gently shook my . . . passenger? Patient? Hostage? What was I going to do with him? He didn\u2019t want a doctor, he said. But as much as I needed a vehicle, I didn\u2019t have it in me to just leave him on the side of the road somewhere and drive off.</p> <p>Just over the next rise in the road, I saw a sign for the Last Chance Motel, which seemed both ominous and appropriate. I took a deep breath through my nose and let it slowly expand my lungs. By the time I exhaled, I\u2019d already formed my plan. At the faded pink motel sign, I turned into the lot and parked in front of the squat, dilapidated building. There were two cars in the lot, including the one in front of the office, which seemed to double as the manager\u2019s quarters.</p><p>I reached toward the passenger seat and gently shook the big guy\u2019s shoulder. His breathing was deep and even. As carefully as I could, I raised the hem of his bloodied shirt and gasped. The bullet wound, just under his ribs on his left side, seemed too small for such a recent injury. The edges of the wound were a healthy pink. And the bullet seemed to be lodged there in his skin.</p><p>I pulled away, scooting across the bench seat. That . . . wasn\u2019t normal.</p><p>Calm down, I ordered myself. There\u2019s no reason to panic. This is good news.</p><p>Maybe some weird act of physics had kept the bullet from penetrating deeply in the first place, I reasoned. I hadn\u2019t gotten a good look at the wound while I was playing action hero in the dark parking lot. In my panic, it must have looked much worse than it was. Either way, the wound looked almost manageable now.</p> <p>\u201cJust hold on tight,\u201d I told him, placing my hand on his shoulder again. He leaned into my touch, trying to nuzzle his cheek against my fingers. \u201cUh, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>It would appear that I was footing the bill for this little slice of heaven. I couldn\u2019t reach his wallet, as it was in his pocket, firmly situated under his butt. I had just enough cash in my purse (a twenty and a few lonely singles) to cover one night. After that, I was dead in the water. The rest of my cash had been stashed behind a dresser in my motel room near Emerson\u2019s.</p><p>I jumped out of the truck and tried to look calm and normal as I walked into the motel\u2019s dingy little office and saw its creepy-as-hell occupant. The hotel seemed to have run a bizarrely specific Internet ad that read, \u201cWanted: semiskilled applicant with off-putting sex-predator vibe and lax standards in personal hygiene.\u201d</p><p>And this guy was no exception. It took no less than three refusals of a \u201croom tour\u201d from the night manager before I was permitted to trade a portion of my precious cash supply for a little plastic tag attached to the oldest freaking room key I had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cTwo beds, right?\u201d I asked, taking the key.</p><p>He shook his head, leering at me. \u201cSingle rooms only. We like to stay cozy here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there a pharmacy anywhere around here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIn town, about four miles down the road. Opens in the morning, around eight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you\u2019re feeling poorly, I have something in my room that might perk you up.\u201d</p><p>I turned on my heel and made a mental note to prop a chair against the outside door once I got to the room.</p><p>I opened up the passenger-side door and saw that the big guy had managed to sit up and had his head resting on the seat back. He was snoring steadily. I spotted a bulky duffel bag in the backseat of the cab and threw it over my shoulder. I unlocked the room door, tossed the bag inside, and steeled myself for the task of hauling his unconscious ass into the room. Careful to keep his bloodied side away from the manager\u2019s window, I hoisted his arm over my shoulder in a sort of ill-advised fireman\u2019s carry and took slow, deliberate steps toward the open door. The movement seemed to reopen the wound, and I could feel blood seeping through my shirt. We made it through the door.</p><p>I heard a distinct metallic plink. I looked down and saw that the bullet had rolled across the filthy carpet and hit the wall.</p><p>I meant to set him gently on the bed but ended up flopping him across the bedspread. The rickety bed squealed in protest as he bounced, but he didn\u2019t bat an eyelash. I huffed, leaning against the yellowed floral wallpaper to catch my breath. \u201cSorry. You\u2019re heavier than you look.\u201d</p><p>I locked the door and wedged the desk chair against the knob. The room was so outdated it was almost in style again but the dirt and neglect screamed \u201cdingy,\u201d not \u201ckitschy.\u201d The carpet was a dank greenish-brown color that could only be described as phlegm. The bedspread, threadbare and nearly transparent in places, matched the shade.</p><p>I shook off the Norman Bates flashbacks and told myself it was just like any of the other crappy indigent motels I\u2019d stayed at in any number of cities, and I hadn\u2019t been stabbed in the shower yet.</p> <p>I turned back to the sleeping giant on the bed. The flannel shirt made an unpleasant ripping noise as I peeled it away, the dried blood causing the stiff material to adhere to his skin. The wound seemed even smaller now, the area around it a perfectly normal, healthy color. I pushed back from him, away from the bed, staring at the minuscule hole in his flesh.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be right.</p><p>Taking a step back, I knocked over his duffel and saw a bottle of Bactine spray sticking out of the partially opened zipper. I arched an eyebrow and pulled the bag open. \u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Never mind having to run to a pharmacy. The bag was filled to the brim with well-used first-aid supplies\u2014mostly peroxide and heavy-duty tweezers. And several different types of exotic jerky. But not much in the way of clothes.</p><p>I glanced from the shrinking bullet hole to the enormous bag of meat treats with its distinct lack of clothes . . . and back to the bullet hole.</p><p>Oh, holy hell, this guy was a werewolf.</p><p>2</p><p>This Is What Happens When You Roughhouse</p><p>I dropped my butt on the bed, staring down at the unconscious shape-shifter and feeling very stupid. I\u2019d spent the last few years as the family physician for a large pack of werewolves in the Crescent Valley, several hundred miles away in southwestern Alaska. I\u2019d recently resigned my position, if one could consider sneaking away in the dead of night a resignation.</p><p>Yes, werewolves were real. They walked among us humans, living relatively normal lives, working normal jobs, and occasionally shifting into enormous wolves and hunting down defenseless woodland creatures. They weren\u2019t alone in the shape-shifting animal kingdom. In my time with the valley pack, I\u2019d met were-horses, were-bears, and even a tragically less cool were-skunk named Harold. If it was a mammal, there was a group of people out there somewhere who could shift into it. (Fish and reptiles were problematic, for some reason.) Presided over by an alpha male\u2014or in the Crescent Valley pack\u2019s case, an alpha female\u2014a pack usually lived \u201cpacked together\u201d in a limited amount of space, such as a single apartment building or a trailer park, depending on the clan\u2019s resources.</p><p>All major life decisions had to be approved by the alpha, from mate selection to college enrollment. Everything had to be deemed for the good of the pack.</p><p>Accepting that (a) these creatures existed and (b) they were now my patients was a strange adjustment for me. I\u2019d had a complete Maggie must have slipped me special mushrooms breakdown the first time she shifted in front of me.</p><p>The scientist in me still had problems accepting the paranormal element of werewolves. I tended to think of their abilities as a genetic bonus, which was easier to accept than magic exists, but you just weren\u2019t lucky enough to have any in your life until you stumbled upon a pack full of eccentric shape-shifters in your late twenties. But after a while, I realized that compared with living with someone whose moods shifted from moment to moment, living with people who had exclusively unstable physical forms was practically a vacation.</p><p>I flopped back onto the bed, noting with a frown that my weight didn\u2019t even jostle the wolf-man. Of course. Of course I would walk away from one of the largest werewolf pack settlements in North America, only to end up trapped in a run-down motel room with a wounded one. Only someone with my logic-defying bad luck could possibly defeat the unlikeliness of those odds. I was the ass-backward Red Riding Hood.</p><p>Had Maggie Graham, my former boss, sent this guy to search for me? The big guy did have the look of the Graham family\u2014dark, rough-hewn, and handsome, not to mention bigger than a barn door, as my gramma would say. But I\u2019d cared for every single member of that pack, treating everything from swine flu to suspicious puncture wounds brought on by \u201cscuffling\u201d with porcupines. I didn\u2019t recognize him, and I certainly would have remembered someone who looked like him.</p><p>Not to mention that werewolves rarely strayed this far from their territory. They were genetically programmed to protect their packlands, to crave hunting within their family\u2019s territory with an ache that went way beyond homesickness and edged into crippling obsession. The chances of some distant Graham cousin venturing this far from the valley for such an extended period of time that I hadn\u2019t met him in the four years I lived there? Not possible.</p><p>And frankly, none of this mattered, because I wasn\u2019t planning on sticking around long enough for getting to know you conversations.</p><p>I sighed. Werewolf or not, I couldn\u2019t let him sleep with bloody, unclean wounds. I searched through the bag and found bandages, tape, Bactine, and hydrogen peroxide. The bathroom was surprisingly clean, which, sadly, was turning out to be the highlight of my day. I ran a washcloth under a warm tap and used it to wipe away the brownish blood from his skin, noting the wound was now about the size of a dime. Worried that it was too deep to use the Bactine, I irrigated it with the peroxide, catching the runoff with a towel. He hissed, arching off the bed, but he ultimately slumped back into unconsciousness. Just to be safe, I sprayed the wound with Bactine and bandaged him up.</p><p>It had taken me some time to get used to werewolf physiology and adjust my medical training to it. While the spontaneous-healing thing made my position as pack doctor easier, it also meant that untreated broken bones could set in bad positions. Wounded skin could heal over foreign matter and dirt, which led to infections.</p><p>Beyond wound care, my chief responsibility had been monitoring and faking state-sanctioned paperwork for as many as a dozen pregnancies at a time. Werewolves were ridiculously fertile. Maggie also appointed me the \u201csupervisor\u201d of the pack\u2019s seniors, who, although they aged a bit more slowly than the average human, were just as susceptible to the typical blood-pressure and joint problems associated with getting old. But they were far less open to accepting these issues, considering them \u201chuman problems.\u201d For one thing, werewolf metabolism burned through calories so quickly that it was damn near impossible to monitor their diets, cholesterol, or salt. Try telling a seventy-year-old who can eat three whole fried chickens in one sitting that he needs to watch his triglycerides. The reaction will be swift and hilarious, and then he will go fetch his friends to tell them what the funny new doctor said.</p><p>The first time there was an emergency with the pack, I\u2019d panicked. It was just claw marks from an unfriendly interaction between Maggie\u2019s lovable idiot cousin Samson and a grizzly. Frankly, he could have healed up on his own within twenty-four hours, but a few stitches moved the process along faster. Samson\u2019s back looked as if he\u2019d made out with Freddy Krueger, and the injuries were so extensive I froze. I couldn\u2019t seem to pick a location to insert the suture needle in his skin.</p><p>And then, of course, Samson was himself.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc, stop staring at my ass and stitch me up,\u201d he\u2019d called over his shoulder.</p><p>That had broken the ice and allowed me to relax and make the first stitch.</p><p>Being able to practice again was a gift I couldn\u2019t quite fathom. Before the valley, medicine had been something I\u2019d had a certain knack for but not something I cared for passionately. I made a healthy salary, which I appreciated. I was good at putting patients at ease and had a talent for sorting through the mysteries of diagnostics. But I didn\u2019t wake up in the morning and think, Oh, what a lucky girl am I!</p><p>In the valley, I rejoiced in the birth of every cub, mourned every death, and felt fortunate to help my patients through every stage in between. Through the pack, I found my purpose. I was able to feel like myself again, without the risk of being discovered. I could feel as if I was putting the very expensive education my parents had helped fund to good use. I had a place of my own making, a community that I\u2019d earned. I built a calm, competent exterior that didn\u2019t garner me any close friendships but kept me on good terms with my neighbors. While the people who greeted me so cheerily each morning may not have known the real me, they appreciated the me they did know.</p><p>Now that my time in the valley was over, I wondered if I would ever find that again. I would likely spend the rest of my life working at places like Emerson\u2019s, where the people were friendly and the work was dull. I supposed I should be grateful for the time I\u2019d had to use my education.</p><p>The big guy would be right as rain in a few hours. I, on the other hand, stood a really good chance of pulling a muscle trying to haul his enormous frame into a comfortable position on the bed. It took a couple of tries, but I managed to pull him by the shoulders until his head was near a pillow. Standing there, watching his chest rise and fall, I was suddenly very tired. I looked down and saw the fist-sized rusty-red splotch on the shoulder of my shirt.</p><p>Damn it. I only had one clean shirt left in my bag. And since I\u2019d left behind everything I owned, I would probably be wearing that shirt for a while. I went into the bathroom, throwing the bloodied towels into a far corner. I dragged my stained shirt carefully over my head, rinsed it as best I could, and hung it over the shower-curtain rod to dry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Swiping at my cheeks, I looked in the mirror. My hair had been all of the colors of the Clairol spectrum since I left home, from jet-black to white-blond. But after I reached the valley, I\u2019d let it go back to its original reddish-gold. It was nice to be back to strawberry-blond, even if people did expect me to be wacky and/or zany, which was irritating on so many levels.</p><p>I looked as exhausted as I felt. I\u2019d been born with open, happy features: wide eyes, a pert little nose, a determined chin. My skin had been peaches and cream, without dark circles under my eyes. My lips had curved into an easy smile for friends, strangers, anybody. And my eyes had been a clear, untroubled green. Now I didn\u2019t even have the energy to offer my reflection an apologetic shrug as I stripped out of my clothes. I locked the bathroom door and took a few deep breaths as I ran the bath tap. I always dreaded motel showers. You never knew what you were getting into. This one had the perfect balance of hot water, just enough burn to bite, but all the pressure of a dime-store water pistol.</p><p>Shampooing with the cheap, splintering bar of motel soap, I prayed that one day I would stumble into a motel that stocked Garnier Fructis for its guests. I rinsed out my dirty underclothes, although I knew there was little chance they would dry before morning. Now that I was clean, I faced a dilemma. I had one change of clothes that I always kept in my tote. I had a backup bag, packed with clothes, cash, and spare ID, in my trunk, but that trunk was now a charcoal briquette.</p> <p>I poked my head out the door to make sure the big guy was still out cold. I crept over to his bag and selected one of the few T-shirts, one that advertised the Suds Bucket in Fairbanks. My short, undernourished frame would swim in it, but it smelled OK, and it covered me, and that was enough. I slipped it on over my last pair of dry, clean panties.</p><p>I checked the locks again and surveyed my sleeping options: the bed, the floor, or the wooden chair currently propped against the door. The idea of sleeping on the nasty carpet was too repulsive. Sleeping on the chair would take a contortionist\u2019s balance and flexibility. The bed won.</p><p>I repacked my bag and placed it on top of my clean jeans, socks, and sneakers, within easy reach of the bed. I pulled back the bedspread, no small task considering that he was lying on top of it.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m going to get in the bed now. I\u2019d like to point out that assaulting someone who\u2019s provided you with medical treatment is tacky.\u201d He snored on, a deep, rumbling sound spiraling out from his chest. \u201cOK, I\u2019ll take that as a tacit promise to be a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>I slid under the stiff white sheets and tried not to think about the last time they\u2019d been washed. I punched the flat pillow into shape and lay on my side, facing the door, which also meant being nose-to-nose with my practically comatose roommate.</p> <p>Blinking at him sleepily, I finally had time to appreciate my bed partner\u2019s face. He was definitely attractive in that rough-hewn, competent way. I sort of wanted to nibble on him, all of him. Was that wrong?</p><p>I groaned and rolled away, putting my back to him. Yes, it was wrong. These were bad thoughts, bad thoughts that led to bad things. Bad things that would probably feel pretty good but would ultimately bite me on the ass. Of course, with that little overbite of his, being bitten on the ass might not\u2014</p><p>I groaned again, pressing my face into the pillow. This was not like me. For the first few months after I ran, I was too scared of my own shadow to let a man within three feet of me, much less see me naked. Sure, I\u2019d been attracted to other men. Hell, the valley had been packed with handsome, eligible fellas who basically threw themselves at anything female and single that they weren\u2019t related to. But I\u2019d been able to stay unattached. I hadn\u2019t dated. I just couldn\u2019t open up to anyone else like that. I didn\u2019t want to give anyone else that sort of power over me.</p><p>There\u2019s no such thing as a one-night stand when you live in such a small community. You see that person over and over, and the awkwardness can be deadly. I hadn\u2019t engaged the services of a no-strings-attached \u201cbounce buddy,\u201d no matter how dark and lonely the winters got.</p><p>And it just felt wrong, starting any sort of relationship when I was still technically married. Lying to someone about my name was one thing. Letting someone think I was a normal, available human being was another.</p><p>Clearly, years without sex had disrupted the important responsible-decision-making neurons in my brain.</p> <p>I scooted across the bed as far as I could. I shoved what would have been his pillow between us. That would provide an impenetrable measure of overnight security, right? I switched off the bedside lamp and pulled the covers up to my chin. I closed my eyes, waiting for sleep to take me.</p><p>I was going to be all right, I told myself. It took a while to learn to live without a cushion, with no safety net.</p><p>The rush of desire to be still again, to go back to the life I\u2019d made, caught me off-guard. Having friends again, a home, a job I didn\u2019t have to settle for, these were dangerously beautiful lures that sent me right back to square one. Square one sucked.</p><p>I knew I wasn\u2019t exactly happy in this gray zone, but I was safe. And for a long time, before the valley, safety was the only happiness I needed. The idea that it might not be enough anymore made my chest ache with the effort to breathe.</p><p>I used to have backup plans and savings accounts, credit cards, and a skin-care regimen. I arrived home from work promptly at 5:25 every night to start dinner. If I arrived after 5:30, Glenn started to worry. And that would mean panicked voice mails on my cell, calls to the state police and the emergency rooms to see if I\u2019d been in an accident, and a lot of fuss and fuming over nothing. I\u2019d learned quickly that it was just easier to leave work ten minutes early every day than to try to convince Glenn that he was being unreasonable.</p><p>When we first started dating, I thought that sort of concern meant that I was important to him, that he was afraid of something happening to me. It\u2019s what I told myself, even when I was assuring my supervisors at the hospital that my husband was a big practical joker after he left threatening voice mails for the head of cardiology. He spotted the two of us chatting at a colleague\u2019s retirement dinner and was convinced we were sleeping together . . . which pretty much guaranteed I would never attend another staff party, just to avoid the potential humiliation. That was, I imagine, the whole point. I lost so many friends, any sort of personal relationships with the people I worked with. I was slowly pared out of their lives, until all I had was Glenn. Just the way he wanted it.</p><p>I\u2019d made so many mistakes, so many exceptions to protect my pride, to prevent admitting, even to myself, how bad my situation had become. My road to hell was paved with rationalizations.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I whispered into the dark. \u201cStop thinking about it.\u201d</p> <p>It was the shock of the parking-lot confrontation, I told myself. The yelling and the flames and then all that adrenaline and blood. That sort of upheaval was bound to bring up unpleasant memories. Tossing under the scratchy sheet, I found myself pressed against my bedmate. The pillow between us had been nudged down on the mattress, so that his face and shoulders were visible. I curled toward him, toward the heat of his body. He smelled of the woods, earthy and wild. Wasn\u2019t that funny? Someone who spent his time in dive bars and honky-tonks smelling like fresh wind and moss? It wasn\u2019t a werewolf thing. I\u2019d spent enough time around the species to know that they weren\u2019t all \u201cApril fresh.\u201d He just smelled right, which in itself was a little alarming and prompted me to shove the pillow between us a little higher.</p><p>Sniffing lightly, he rolled toward me, his hand sliding over my shoulder and resting near my neck. Somehow, I\u2019d expected it to be uncomfortable, being touched like this again. But while I certainly had some lingering werewolf-gunshot-wound-related questions, it didn\u2019t feel wrong to have this man\u2019s hand on me. I felt warm, down to the tips of my toes, comfortably, blissfully warm. I leaned closer until my forehead was resting against his arm and just lived in that warmth for a moment. In my head, I was basking in the summer sun on my parents\u2019 back porch, knowing my mother would come out any minute to fuss at me about putting on sunscreen. I hadn\u2019t heard my mother\u2019s voice in such a long time. What I wouldn\u2019t give just to hear her fuss at me about wrinkles and sun spots once more. But she was gone.</p><p>My eyes fluttered open, and I pulled out of the recollection. I wouldn\u2019t think of my mother right now, not in a place like this, with a supernatural creature snoring beside me. She definitely wouldn\u2019t have approved of my getting myself into this sort of situation. This was far outside of the realm of problems that could be fixed with sunscreen. I reluctantly moved away. But I found that my head was a lot clearer. I closed my eyes and started playing the \u201cRandom Game\u201d in my head, a little brain exercise I\u2019d made up to help me sleep in strange places. I would think of one of my favorite things from my old life\u2014a TV show, a book, an ice cream flavor\u2014and then randomly connect it to something else I liked, and something else, then something else. The pleasant imagery, combined with stream-of-consciousness thinking, lulled me right to sleep. I remembered going to see this terrible movie, The Chase, with my best friend, Teri. It was one of the first movies we\u2019d been allowed to go to the theater to see on our own. And we picked a movie starring Charlie Sheen and Kristy Swanson. Oh, the vagaries of youth.</p><p>Kristy Swanson also played a fictional version of Anna Nicole Smith on Law &amp; Order. I remembered watching some weird clip of Anna Nicole\u2019s reality show on Talk Soup, where she was riding around in a limousine, whining and eating an obscenely large pickle. They used to serve pickles like that at basketball games at my high school. The booster clubs would serve them in little paper cups. If you ate one in front of my classmates, you could expect a lot of remarks about oral exams at school on Monday.</p><p>My brain bounced around like that for a few more minutes, from overrated Sheens to celeb-reality to giant pickles. My limbs were heavy. My eyelids fluttered closed. As I drifted off to sleep, I had no idea what tomorrow would bring. I didn\u2019t know how I was going to get out of this little town, where I would go, how I would live. For now, I was clean, and I wasn\u2019t sleeping in my car. And I\u2019d managed to help someone who needed it. The rest I could sort out tomorrow.</p><p>3</p><p>Plastic Handcuffs: Fun for the Whole Family</p><p>I was warm. I was safe. There was a pleasantly heavy weight against my stomach, and someone was rubbing his thumb along my cheek. My hands skimmed over the shape on top of me and threaded through thick, silky hair.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>My eyes snapped open. The werewolf was on top of me. I bit back a scream when the warm, rough hand clasped the back of my neck. Whiskers scratched my neck, leaving a burning path in their wake. I tapped at his shoulders, unable to push his heavy weight off of me.</p><p>\u201cUm, hey, I think you\u2019ve got the wrong ide\u2014mmph.\u201d His mouth closed over mine. It was soft, wet, and hot. My bedmate broke the warm, wet kiss, running the tip of his nose along my throat and making sweet, soft rumbling noises. My hands went from batting at his shoulders to lightly tracing the line of his neck.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t entirely unpleasant to have someone this close, to have the heat from someone else\u2019s skin seeping into mine. I wasn\u2019t so startled when he kissed me again, teasing my tongue with his own as I opened to him. His hand cupped the weight of my breast in his palm before lightly pinching the nipple through his Suds Bucket T-shirt. I arched off the bed, and he used the opportunity to slide a hand under my butt, grinding his hips against me.</p><p>Blood flowed into my cheeks, and a pulsating coil of tension started building between my legs. My eyes fluttered open. His were shut, and not just in a \u201cbusy kissing\u201d way. They were half-shut in that dazed, heavy-lidded expression of someone who\u2019s only just woken up and is on the verge of passing out again. But his movements, while languid, had a purpose, and that purpose seemed to be stripping me out of my clothes.</p><p>I pulled away slightly, my eyebrows furrowed. Was he asleep, or was he faking this?</p><p>I\u2019d heard of sleepwalking, but sleep-snuggling?</p><p>Was this a werewolf thing? Should I wake him up? I\u2019d heard that was dangerous. Of course, letting a stranger have unprotected sleep sex with you couldn\u2019t be terribly safe. Frankly, his touching me didn\u2019t feel wrong or bad. I traced my fingers along the contours of his face, thumbing the arch of his cheekbones. He leaned into the caress and made that happy purring noise. I smiled into the darkness of the room. I\u2019d gone far too long without any sort of connection to another human being. I missed something as simple as choosing to be touched.</p><p>Leaning closer, I let the tip of my nose run along his cheek, inhaling the warm, woodsy fragrance of his skin. I sighed, tangled my fingers into his mass of dark hair, and kissed him greedily. He moaned, a deep, rumbling sound that vibrated from his chest to mine. I expected him to reach for his belt. I was prepared for it. But he just pulled me back to his chest and wrapped his arms around me, holding me close. His lips worried my throat in tight little circles, his teeth nipping lightly at the skin until he reached the spot where my neck met my shoulder. I was relaxing into him, enjoying the alternately soft and sharp sensations, when I felt him scrape his teeth along the line of my throat. He paused, pressing his canines into the soft web of flesh where my shoulder and neck joined, hard enough that he was millimeters from breaking through the skin. I gasped, tensing my back so quickly that the crown of my head caught his chin. He yelped, then licked at the spot he\u2019d injured, nuzzling it, cuddling against me as if trying to apologize. This was so far outside the etiquette of how to thank someone who has treated your gunshot wound it wasn\u2019t even funny.</p><p>I tried to wriggle out of his arms, but I might as well have been wrapped in an iron cage. He was immovable. But instead of trying to bite me again, he simply tucked his face into the crook of my neck and commenced snoring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now suddenly wide-awake, I stared into the darkness of the motel room and rubbed at my neck. And she was never heard from again.</p><p>I lay there at dawn, blinking into the dark, until the sun rose. After climbing out of bed, I got my bag together and put on my last clean shirt. The mark he\u2019d made on my neck just looked like a bad hickey, the impression of his teeth barely visible. In the light of day, I could not explain what the hell he\u2019d done. Had he meant to hurt me? Was it some weird flashback to an old girlfriend?</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what it meant. It was probably significant in some way, but I didn\u2019t know how. That was what bothered me. Werewolves were born, not turned, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about going all furry the next time I got pissed off at the post office. Side note: The fullness of the moon wasn\u2019t a factor for werewolves. After their initial postpuberty transition, they could phase whenever they felt like it. Or when they got angry. Or happy. Or bored. Or when they were asleep and had a particularly wolfy dream.</p> <p>I sighed, rubbing my tired eyes. I was not as familiar with werewolf sexual practices as one might think. It was natural that I overheard ladies-locker-room talk from some of the females, rumors about size and stamina and other subjects that gave the wolf-aunties reason to laugh at my red cheeks. But as pack leader and the alpha female, Maggie was adamant that there were some things I didn\u2019t need to know. And considering what her cousin Samson did let slip, that was probably best for the sake of my emotional health.</p><p>I knew that a claiming bite was part of the delicate werewolf mating protocol. But we hadn\u2019t been naked, much less had sex, and he hadn\u2019t managed to break the skin. So surely my wicked hickey didn\u2019t count. Right?</p><p>I really didn\u2019t want to wait around for this guy to wake up so I could ask whether he\u2019d intentionally bit me and what that meant. But there I sat, at the edge of the bed, watching him, unsure of what else to do. Should I ask him if I could ride with him to the next thing resembling civilization? Did I want to stay with him? I mean, he\u2019d almost bitten me. And he had people shooting at him, which didn\u2019t say much for him in terms of character. If I were smart, I would creep quietly out of the room and be on my way.</p><p>But I just couldn\u2019t. Before I left, I needed to make sure he was going to be OK. I felt responsible for him. Somehow, I\u2019d fallen into pack thinking, without the actual werewolf genes or the cool superpowers. I had gotten the short end of the T-bone on this deal.</p><p>And on top of everything else, I was starving. I hadn\u2019t eaten since lunch the previous day. Between the cold, my low BMI, and whatever fresh hell the road was going to throw at me that day, I needed calories desperately. I considered the turkey jerky, which was the least weird, compared to the alligator, ostrich, and venison. But I didn\u2019t think my roommate would appreciate waking up to find me rifling through his bag, stealing his preserved meat. I considered driving closer to town to see if I could find a diner or something. But he definitely wouldn\u2019t appreciate waking up to find that his truck was missing, either. I was still contemplating grand theft auto versus exotic jerky when his eyes fluttered open, slowly taking in the room. With a jerk, he rolled off the bed to his feet. He seemed to be searching the room. And when his eyes settled on me, the searching stopped.</p> <p>He stared at me, as if trying to jog his memory. His nostrils flared, and he seemed to recognize something. His eyes narrowed.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>\u201cHi. I was there last night when you were, um . . . well, I got you here and cleaned you up.\u201d I hitched my bag over my shoulder and made for the door. \u201cRoom\u2019s paid up till eleven. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>He was at the door before I could blink. \u201cAck!\u201d I cried, hating the way I cringed against the door, arms curved protectively over my head. With his head cocked to the side, he curled his fingers around my wrists and pulled them down. I nearly yanked them back, but his hands were gentle. He ran the tip of his nose along my hairline.</p><p>\u201cL-look, you can check your bag, I didn\u2019t take anything,\u201d I stammered.</p><p>He moved closer, inhaling deeply while his fingers traced over the mark on my neck. And there was that weird purring noise again.</p> <p>Right, pretend ignorance of werewolves and their near-bite-y tendencies. Avoid explanations of why you know about the existence of werewolves. Those conversations could only lead to bad places.</p><p>\u201cIf this is about the shooting . . . I won\u2019t tell anybody. I don\u2019t even know who would believe me.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled his cheek against my temple. \u201cMine. You stay with me.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow. \u201cBeg pardon?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were all spacey and bleary as he murmured, \u201cYou stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t stay with anybody,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><p>His fingers curled around my arms, and he pulled me close, trailing his nose along my hairline and caressing the spot where he\u2019d tried to bite me. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I pulled at his grip, but damn it, this guy was strong. My hand snaked into my purse for the slapjack I carried, thin layers of leather surrounding a heavy lead ball that hurt like hell when it connected with a sensitive joint. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop now!\u201d I said in the most commanding tone I could muster. Shoving him away from my body, I brought the heavy weight of the slapjack down on the wrist that held my arm. And I stomped on his foot, hard.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he yelped. He seemed to come back to himself; his pupils were less constricted. He blinked a few times and cleared his threat. \u201cOw,\u201d he said again, almost absentmindedly, rubbing his wrist. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnne McCaffrey,\u201d I blurted out, hoping that he didn\u2019t spend a lot of time reading carefully crafted science fiction. His realizing I\u2019d just used my favorite author as an alias would prove . . . awkward. The werewolf frowned at me, as if he could sense the lie, but before he could comment, I added, \u201cI helped you out last night when you were hurt. And now I would like you to back away from me very slowly, so I can open the door and get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>Where was I going? I had no clue. More important, I had no vehicle. But it had to be safer than hanging around werewolf shooting victims with toothy tendencies.</p><p>His glance shot down to the slapjack in my hand, and he took a careful, small step back. \u201cThat was you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we covered this. Did you bump your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing in the parking lot last night?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter? I bandaged you up, borrowed your shirt. I figure that makes us even. So I\u2019m going to be on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head and clamping his hand around my arm. \u201cI owe you. You stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s lovely that you\u2019ve moved on to using definitive sentences, but I think you\u2019ll find that you are not, in fact, the boss of me. Now, let go of my arm, or I reintroduce you to Mr. Slappy.\u201d I waved the slapjack in his face. A guilty expression slipped across his features, and his fingers loosened their hold.</p><p>He scrubbed his hand over the respectable growth of stubble on his cheeks. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry. This is all a little too much for first thing in the morning with no coffee and a gunshot wound.\u201d</p><p>I glanced down to his middle, which he didn\u2019t seem to be babying all that much. He\u2019d had a few hours for his tissues to knit themselves back together. But the stupid ingrained medical training had me blowing a long breath from my nose as I asked, \u201cAre you in pain?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hand over the gauze absently. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing shot is no big deal?\u201d Before he could stop me, I was peeling the bandage back from his skin, making him yowl as the adhesive caught tiny dark hairs of the little happy trail down his stomach.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d he exclaimed as I attempted to examine him. He batted my hands away.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a baby. I just want to make sure you\u2019re OK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he grumbled, pressing the bandage back into place and angling his wounded side away from me. He didn\u2019t want me inspecting his wound, I realized. He didn\u2019t want me to see that it was now fully healed, barely distinct from the rest of his skin. Because he wasn\u2019t sure how much I knew about the whole werewolf thing, and he didn\u2019t want me getting extra clues.</p><p>Right. This was my cue to exit, before he could pull me into some other bizarre werewolf bullshit or vice versa. \u201cOK, then, well, if you\u2019re feeling all right, I\u2019ll just toddle along.\u201d</p><p>I had just managed to get the door open when he yanked it closed again.</p><p>I glared up at him. \u201cThis is becoming really annoying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I wanted to keep that information to myself, to be able to walk away from this situation feeling some dignity about the way I\u2019d handled myself. Also, he just wasn\u2019t entitled to know. So all I said was \u201cSouth.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cJust \u2018south\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSouthern Alaska,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cThank you for clarifying. And what a coincidence. I was heading that way myself.\u201d</p><p>I deadpanned, \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do say.\u201d He gave me a sharp nod, as if this was exactly according to some crazy, half-naked military plan he had tucked away somewhere. \u201cSo . . . Anne, you\u2019re staying with me.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open, and I made an indelicate snorting noise. \u201cWhy on earth would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re pretty, you\u2019re fun-sized, and you\u2019re up here on your own,\u201d he said, ticking my offenses off on his long fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Not safe? Like I could be minding my own business and then suddenly get pulled into a gunfight and car explosions by a total stranger? I don\u2019t think that will happen more than once. And I definitely don\u2019t need anyone to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>He scoffed, that mocking white grin splitting his tanned face. \u201cNo, you seem to be fine on your own. Working a shitty job in a grocery store in the middle of nowhere. That\u2019s the sweet life, all right.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flushed hot. \u201cScrew you, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you, Caleb.\u201d It was a struggle, resisting the urge to kick him in the shins. It really was.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a better plan? Or any plan?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s the first thing you\u2019re going to do when you walk out that door? Hitchhike, right? You\u2019ll be lucky if one or two trucks pass this way, this time of day. And you never know what sort of psycho could be behind the wheel. With me, at least you know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m getting a condescending he-man who sniffs me.\u201d</p><p>And attempts to bite me while sleep-snuggling.</p><p>\u201cWell, you smell nice,\u201d he said, shrugging as if that excused the scratch-and-sniffery. When I didn\u2019t respond to his \u201ccharm\u201d with the expected giggling and swooning, he sighed. \u201cJust let me make sure you\u2019re safe, OK? I have to do some driving for work. You might find another town you like, find someplace to stay. Until then, I can keep an eye on you, repay you for saving my life. Do you think you\u2019re going to get a better offer from a random trucker?\u201d</p><p>I glared up at him and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cBesides, who knows what could happen to me with this nearly mortal wound I\u2019ve suffered?\u201d he said, gesturing dramatically to his bandage.</p><p>I leveled a disbelieving gaze at him through my eyelashes. \u201cThe mortal wound that was \u2018no big deal\u2019 just a little while ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could lose consciousness or develop an infection, maybe even get shot again without someone watching my back. You don\u2019t want that on your conscience, do you?\u201d Caleb\u2019s beatific smile was too well rehearsed to be genuine.</p><p>I pursed my lips, considering the pros and cons of this insane situation. Maybe I was being unfair to Caleb. Other than their astronomical caloric intake and their propensity for public nudity, werewolves were just regular people. They were nice, for the most part, with the exception of the psychotic, power-hungry assholes who occasionally staged coups to take over neighboring packs.</p><p>Happened more often than you might think.</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t strike me as a psychotic asshole. So far, he hadn\u2019t lied to me. He hadn\u2019t hurt me, intentionally. And even when he\u2019d invaded my personal space, I hadn\u2019t panicked or felt threatened, and that was saying something. I had the distinct impression that if Caleb told me he would keep me safe, I would be safe. And safety was tempting, too tempting, as I considered how long it would take me to come up with a plan to get to Anchorage with no money and no car.</p><p>\u201cOK. But if we\u2019re going to do this, you\u2019re going to have to stop that,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat!\u201d I said, shrugging off his hands, which had been absently running up and down my arms. \u201cThe touching and the sniffing and the . . . nuzzling. That stops, right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you want me to nuzzle you?\u201d he asked, his voice returning to that gruff, husky tenor from the night before. And I felt my knees sag a little bit.</p><p>Damn it. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stepped a little closer. I pressed back against the door. \u201cWhat if you ask me to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I say the words, \u2018Caleb, please nuzzle me,\u2019 you can do your worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d He grinned at me again in a way that can only be described as \u201chappy puppy\u201d and loped away toward the bathroom. I wandered to the bed and dropped to it, dazed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What the hell just happened?</p><p>Now that I could get a good look at Caleb\u2019s truck in the daylight, I could appreciate the serviceable vehicle. While the exterior red paint was pristine, the inside showed the wear and tear of a lot of time on the road. The passenger-side floorboard was littered with meat snack packets and foam coffee cups. And while Caleb had managed not to bleed on the cushy gray upholstery, the dash was covered in gas receipts and dust. I hadn\u2019t noticed any of that the night before, but it\u2019s amazing what you can overlook when someone has a bleeding gut wound.</p><p>After my nuzzle embargo, Caleb gave me a pretty roomy space bubble on the ride into town. The only time he even reached across the center line dividing the front seat was to hand me some peanut butter crackers he had stashed in the console.</p> <p>\u201cSo, no bullshit, what\u2019s your real name?\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him and repeated myself. \u201cAnne McCaffrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no bullshit.\u201d My mouth dropped open, and he smirked. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m familiar with faked names. Besides, you think you\u2019re the only person who\u2019s stepped inside a bookstore? Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. There was no sense in trying to continue the lie. Frankly, it was embarrassing to be caught. Just my luck to have found the only male werewolf to have read The Dragonriders of Pern. It was worth a shot, but I\u2019d gotten used to answering to Anna, anyway. \u201cIt is Anna.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a little bit more. \u201cAnna what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll you need to know is that you should call me Anna,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He frowned, looking more hurt than irritated, but obviously decided to drop the subject. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t answer my questions before. Where you from?\u201d he asked as I tried hard to refrain from shoving the crackers into my mouth like a carb-lover on her cheat day.</p><p>\u201cAround,\u201d I said, barely containing the cracker bits from spewing out of my mouth. I was, as Maggie was prone to saying, a delicate flower.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cIllinois, Ohio, Kansas, Texas, Nevada, Idaho, Oregon.\u201d Let\u2019s just say it was a long and winding road from leaving my marriage to arriving in Alaska. \u201cI don\u2019t like to be tied down to one place for too long. I like to explore my options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a grocery checker?\u201d He snorted.</p> <p>I stared up at him. That was the second time he\u2019d referred to my job at Emerson\u2019s. How the hell did he know about that? It wasn\u2019t as if I\u2019d introduced myself to him as a grocery checker/impromptu medical professional. My hand crept along the door, fingers curling around the handle. Because doing a Charlie\u2019s Angels roll out of a truck onto the highway was an awesome idea. And just then, my bloodied Emerson\u2019s Dry Goods apron caught my eye.</p><p>Oh. Right. He was capable of picking up visual cues.</p><p>Feeling very foolish for my paranoia, I countered, \u201cGrocery checker, dog shampooer, waitress. You got a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no problem with grocery checkers or waitresses,\u201d he assured me, smiling cheekily. \u201cAs long as they remember the ketchup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing you get your food spit in a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you were getting off of work last night, and that\u2019s why you happened by my, uh, discussion with Marty?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and glanced sideways at him. \u201cSo what are you?\u201d His brow creased, and he stared at me, as if he was trying to find some hidden meaning in the question. \u201cWhat do you do for a living? Given the number of jerky wrappers and to-go cups on the floorboards, I\u2019m guessing you spend a lot of time in this truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met any other people like me?\u201d he asked, still eyeing me carefully.</p> <p>\u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re answering my questions with completely unrelated questions?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep some mystery about me,\u201d he said, his tone flat.</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest, harrumphing as we reached the main drag of Sharpton. Caleb\u2019s big red truck caught the attention of the handful of shopkeepers opening their doors for the day, making them stop and stare after us as we drove by. Everyone knew everyone in little settlements like these. New people attracted a lot of attention. And longtime locals weren\u2019t particularly friendly to \u201coutsiders.\u201d But for the most part, they were strong little communities. Neighbors relied on one another for resources and entertainment, particularly during the long winters. Beyond my medical skills, I had been highly valuable to the pack for my ability to make homemade caramel corn. Werewolves loved caramel corn. It was the only way to make the Gilbert boys take their flu shots without biting me.</p><p>We pulled into the parking lot of a diner that looked halfway reputable. As the truck slowed, I heard something, probably one of the dozen or so ChapSticks I kept in my bag, roll under the seat into the back of the cab.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get us a booth,\u201d Caleb told me as I shoved the seat forward. Peering under the front seat, I felt along the hard plastic edge for my errant lip balm, but instead, my fingers closed over a strange metallic curved object tucked into a groove under the seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d I pulled it out into the light. Handcuffs. I felt under the seat again and found plastic zip ties, a collapsible metal police baton, duct tape, and rope, all Velcroed to the bottom of the seat. And now that I looked at the back of the front seat, I realized that there was a collapsible metal grate attached to it, the kind that cops had in their squad cars to keep suspects contained in the back.</p><p>I dropped my bag, backing away. This guy had a serial killer\u2019s tool kit in the back of his truck.</p><p>A strange sense of betrayal bloomed, astringent and bitter, in my chest. For a moment, I\u2019d let myself believe in this guy. I\u2019d wanted to trust in that promise of safety, in the prospect of being able to relax into familiar wolfy territory for just a few days, to feel that I wasn\u2019t alone. The fact that I\u2019d wanted it so badly, so quickly, scared me even more than the possible uses for three sets of adjustable bungee cords.</p><p>I scanned the front window of the diner. Caleb was already sitting in a booth. If I just slipped away, he probably wouldn\u2019t notice for a while that I hadn\u2019t followed him in. There was a bar up the main street. Maybe I could hitch a ride with someone there. I hadn\u2019t done that in a while, and obviously, my self-preservation skills were pretty rusty. But I guessed the devil you didn\u2019t know would likely be safer than the devil you knew had freaking duct tape and cuffs in his truck.</p><p>I had to admit the collapsible baton was cool. I supposed it was much more effective than my slapjack, not to mention having a better reach. And I rationalized that if I took it, he wouldn\u2019t be using it on unsuspecting hitchhikers. I palmed it and dropped it into my bag.</p><p>Slinging that bag over my shoulders, I glanced back at the diner window but didn\u2019t see Caleb. I backed away from the truck and\u2014</p><p>\u201cAck!\u201d I shouted, jumping out of my skin and cursing myself for not keeping the baton handy. No matter how much time I\u2019d spent around them, it was always shocking to me that big, bulky werewolves could move so quietly.</p><p>While his tone was friendly, his posture was tense. He frowned down at me. \u201cJust wanted to see what was taking so long. You OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think this is a mistake,\u201d I said, my fingers frantically searching through my bag for the slapjack. I stepped away from him, putting the open truck door between us. His brow furrowed, and he took a step toward me. I stepped farther away, onto the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a mistake?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThis whole \u2018riding together\u2019 idea. I\u2019ll be fine on my own, really. Thanks for getting me this far, though.\u201d I turned, taking brisk, long steps up the sidewalk. He stood, staring at me, perplexed. \u201cGood luck . . . with your whole Ted Bundy thing,\u201d I muttered softly as I rushed away.</p><p>In a blink, Caleb was in front of me, holding my arms against my sides. \u201cWhat did you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>Great, I forgot that my new best friend had an advanced serial-killer kit and superhuman hearing. Oh, and healing powers. I was one lucky girl.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you mean?\u201d he demanded. His eyes followed mine back to the open truck door and the cuffs and zip ties lying out on his floorboards.</p><p>\u201cWhat normal person rolls with this sort of thing in his backseat, Caleb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good explanation for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there is. I just don\u2019t care,\u201d I retorted.</p><p>\u201cLook, come inside, have some breakfast with me, and I\u2019ll explain. If you still think I\u2019m a serial killer afterward, I\u2019ll pay the check, and you can stay here at the motel until you figure out what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, let\u2019s go inside,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t serious!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cHow stupid do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, what\u2019s the harm in having breakfast?\u201d he chided. And he added, \u201cWith plenty of witnesses.\u201d</p><p>I might have objected that I was fine, not hungry in the slightest. But then my traitorous empty stomach growled, as if on cue.</p><p>He smirked at me. \u201cI bet this place has great pancakes.\u201d</p><p>I growled in frustration, my shoulders sagged, and I let him nudge me through the front door of the diner. There was a chubby middle-aged man cooking in the kitchen and a bored-looking teenage girl taking orders. Two burly men in plaid flannel sat at the counter, quietly eating steak and eggs. No one, including the teenager, bothered to look up when we walked in.</p><p>I might have been embarrassed by my nervous habit of cataloguing each new room\u2019s occupants, but Caleb was equally funny about the seating arrangements. He insisted on a booth by the front window, but he seemed uncomfortable sitting with his back to the door. His safety concerns didn\u2019t exactly increase my trust in him. And despite the fact that I needed the restroom with increasing urgency, I didn\u2019t want to leave him unattended around my food or drink. He was paying for my French toast, but that didn\u2019t entitle him to mickey my OJ.</p><p>The food arrived without fanfare from the apathetic teen queen. Caleb\u2019s breakfast consisted of six strips of bacon, sausage, a bloody steak, scrambled eggs, and three pancakes, which I watched him devour with a fascination I used to reserve for Shark Week.</p><p>\u201cOK, we\u2019re eating, you\u2019re paying, now spill,\u201d I said around a mouthful of maple-soaked fried bread. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the hardware?\u201d</p><p>He looked a bit sheepish, chewing his pancake thoughtfully while he chose his words. \u201cI\u2019m a sort of bounty hunter,\u201d he said. \u201cI track people down, people who don\u2019t want to be found. I take them in, collect the reward. Generally, they kick and spit and scream on the long drive home, so I have to restrain them. That\u2019s why I have the handcuffs and the bungee cords.\u201d</p><p>My fork practically clattered to the table as a cold weight settled into my belly. Well, that certainly explained why I hadn\u2019t seen him around the valley. He was out wandering the roads, ruining the lives of perfectly nice fugitives. A ripple of alarm skittered up my spine. I clutched the table\u2019s edge with my right hand to calm the slight tremor there. I swallowed carefully and wished I could reach for the juice without bobbling the glass. \u201cShow me your ID.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBail bondsmen are required to carry ID with them when they make \u2018citizen\u2019s arrests.\u2019 Show it to me.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and washed down half a pancake with some coffee. \u201cWell, some of my collars are not quite . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegal?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, looking embarrassed for a millisecond.</p><p>\u201cDo you carry a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t get shot at very often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if that\u2019s not an endorsement for a profession, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d I said, slowly and deliberately reaching for my juice glass. It was a miracle of concentration that held my hand steady as I sipped. Over the rim of the glass, I kept my eyes trained on his face, as if I didn\u2019t have a care in the world. Nothing to fear. Nothing to send me running for the nearest exit.</p><p>\u201cNormally, people don\u2019t get the drop on me,\u201d he said defensively. \u201cI have a certain set of . . . skills, and they help me when I\u2019m tracking a person. The people in my family have always been hunters. I just apply it in a different way.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. He wasn\u2019t kidding. Werewolves had supersensitive noses and ears, not to mention their intuitive ability to track whatever creature was unlucky enough to be targeted by an animal built for hunting.</p><p>But again, I was supposed to be playing dumb. Because if I blurted out, Yeah, I know about the whole werewolf thing that is supposed to be forbidden knowledge for a human such as myself, there would be a lot of awkward questions. More awkward than the ones currently being bandied across the table, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI make a lot of money at something I\u2019m good at. No questions asked, as long as someone is willing to pay me my fee. And sometimes all I have to do is get a little information and pass it along. I like those jobs. Easy money and less time spent rooting around in parking lots.\u201d</p><p>His conversation with the guy who shot him made so much more sense now. This Marty guy had been afraid that Caleb was taking him in on money he owed, so he freaked out and started shooting. I did not need this. I did not need to hitch myself to any form of law enforcement, no matter how slipshod. Glenn had contacts in more places than I\u2019d ever imagined\u2014old college buddies, online gaming clubbers, and sketchy cousins I hadn\u2019t been allowed to speak to at the wedding reception. And all it would take was a couple of opportune Google searches for Caleb to find the online message boards where Glenn had put out feelers for me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t think Caleb would have any qualms about handing me over to my ex, \u201cno questions asked.\u201d Even the way he phrased it gave me chills. He sounded so cold, so calculated, so like\u2014</p><p>Never mind! Get out! My brain screamed at me. Get away! The ladies\u2019 room was to the immediate left of the door, offset by a small hallway. So feigning a bladder issue and sneaking out the front wouldn\u2019t work. There was probably another exit in the back, through the kitchen, and a fire exit, but both were in Caleb\u2019s line of sight. I willed my face to relax, first my jaw and then my cheeks, so I could speak without looking tense. I took a casual bite of my bacon.</p><p>\u201cHow do you get your assignments? How do people know how to get ahold of you?\u201d I asked. I leaned forward, resting my chin on my hand as if he had my rapt attention. I glanced behind him. Maybe there was another way out off of the restroom area. These places always had fire exits, but I couldn\u2019t risk setting off some alarm.</p> <p>\u201cA buddy of mine owns a bar about an hour outside Fairbanks. If people want to get ahold of me, they know to call me there. And I have contacts of my own in Anchorage, Portland, Seattle. Mostly PIs who don\u2019t want to make the trip up here. They get a finder\u2019s fee for hiring me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you just bounce around on the road?\u201d I asked, swiping the last bite of French toast through the golden puddle of syrup on my plate. I savored the crisp edges of the fried bread, unsure when I\u2019d be able to get another nice, hot meal.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I head home to see my family. But I haven\u2019t been there in a while. They live in the Crescent Valley near Grundy, very tight-knit.\u201d</p><p>That explained why I\u2019d never met him. He hadn\u2019t been to the valley for years. I\u2019d heard stories about a Caleb from Maggie, strange \u201cstupid criminal\u201d tales from her cousin the bounty hunter, who hadn\u2019t come back home since his dad, Artie, had died of stroke complications shortly before I was hired on. The funeral service had been held just after I\u2019d arrived, while I was off restocking the clinic\u2019s medications and supplies. I was still so pale and shaky and skittish that Eli, the former pack leader, insisted on sending one of the distant pack cousins with me on the supply run. I only realized later that it was because he was afraid I would take off and not come back. I remembered now that Artie\u2019s son left town before I returned two days later, and that had upset some of the older aunties.</p><p>Still, I wondered how Caleb managed to stay away from the valley for so long. Maggie\u2019s brother, Cooper, had exiled himself for a while after a particularly violent interpack confrontation, and the separation nearly drove him insane. How could Caleb stand it?</p> <p>Not that I could afford to care about that sort of thing, since I was contemplating escaping from this booth and bursting through the front window of the diner like something out of a Die Hard movie. While his being a part of Maggie\u2019s pack was a pleasant surprise, that didn\u2019t necessarily make Caleb a good person. As evidenced by Eli, the interim alpha who hired me just before going on a hiker-killing spree and framing Maggie\u2019s brother, Cooper, for the maulings. Werewolves hit a lot of different points on the spectrum between \u201cawesome guy who is occasionally an apex predator\u201d and \u201cfurry Lord Voldemort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how about you?\u201d he asked, forking up another massive bite of steak. \u201cWhat\u2019s a nice girl like you doing bouncing around the Great North?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a bland smile. \u201cI wanted to see more of the country.\u201d</p><p>His being part of Maggie\u2019s pack didn\u2019t make me trust Caleb any more than I had before. I\u2019d made a clean break with them and couldn\u2019t let on that I knew his family. They couldn\u2019t know where I was or where I was heading. It was safer for them and for me. Also, I was pretty sure Maggie would kick my ass for leaving the way I did. She was a stickler about policy and procedure.</p><p>\u201cAnd why are you traveling south?\u201d he asked. \u201cGetting too cold for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting up with a friend,\u201d I lied smoothly.</p> <p>Caleb tensed. \u201cWhat sort of friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old roommate, Cindy,\u201d I said.</p><p>The tension drained out of Caleb\u2019s frame, and he scooped up another bite. \u201cWell, that\u2019s nice. But you never know what could happen.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, plans change sometimes,\u201d he said vaguely.</p><p>What did he mean by that? Was he going to change my plans for me? Under the table, my hand instinctively wrapped around my shoulder bag. I considered the ladies\u2019 room again. I couldn\u2019t remember seeing bathroom windows on the front of the building. Did that mean they opened at the sides?</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSo do you believe that I\u2019m not, in fact, a serial killer?\u201d</p><p>I kept my face neutral. No, he was something much more dangerous. And I had a sneaking suspicion he was probably quite good at his job.</p> <p>I smiled blandly. \u201cI\u2019m almost convinced.\u201d I stood and hooked my shoulder bag over my arm.</p><p>He scowled. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ladies\u2019 room? I\u2019ve had three glasses of juice.\u201d</p><p>He gave me an apologetic little shrug, although he eyed my purse with suspicion. I turned on my heel and walked as casually as I could through the dingy restroom door. Swearing mental apologies to any other girls in the dining room, I shoved the rubber wedge stopper under the door until it couldn\u2019t be budged.</p><p>The bathroom was a pink-tiled one-seater with a crank window just over the toilet. I stood on the seat, trying to gauge whether my shoulders would fit through. Glancing outside at the unkempt little side yard between the diner and the garage next door, I turned the window crank. Given the ungodly squealing noise it made, I guessed that it hadn\u2019t been used in a while. Cringing, I glanced over my shoulder, waiting for the sound of Caleb the bounty hunter approaching the door.</p><p>I turned the crank again, and it gave a bit, lifting the window slowly. After a few turns, it was open just wide enough that I could squeeze my head through. After giving it one last rotation for good luck, I zipped my shoulder bag and tossed it through. I carefully stepped on top of the toilet tank, praying it would support my weight while I slithered through the opening.</p><p>I told myself it was a game, a claustrophobic version of limbo. How small could I go? Contracting my body into the most aerodynamic shape possible, I slipped my hand into the cool morning air. My head and shoulders slid out easily, but my stomach and hips caught sideways on the ledge, stealing my breath.</p><p>\u201cStupid French toast!\u201d I muttered, wiggling myself free.</p><p>I looked down and realized I was a good five feet off the dirt, head down, with no clue how to land safely.</p><p>\u201cThis was a stupid plan,\u201d I told myself, gritting my teeth against the pressure on my middle, debating if taking my chances with Caleb would have been a better option than giving myself a traumatic brain injury involving a toilet.</p><p>Suddenly, my hips worked loose, and I free-fell. I shoved my hands over my head as I flailed my legs. My ankle caught against the sill on the way down, slowing my descent, so I was able to flop down on my back instead of face-planting.</p><p>\u201cStupid, stupid plan.\u201d I huffed, struggling against gravity and my lackluster upper-body strength. \u201cStupid gravity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re hanging out of the bathroom window by your feet?\u201d Caleb asked wryly.</p><p>\u201cDang it!\u201d I cried as my feet lost their tenuous hold against the windowsill.</p><p>I dropped, rolling my shoulder against the asphalt and landing with an uhf. In a few seconds, Caleb was lifting me by my underarms, my feet barely brushing the ground.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is embarrassing,\u201d I grumbled, twisting out of his grip.</p><p>Reluctantly, he dropped me to the asphalt, and I yanked my rumpled clothes back into place. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have to ask, you\u2019re probably not a very good bounty hunter,\u201d I retorted, with far more dignity than I deserved, given the whole hanging-upside-down-from-a-bathroom-window thing.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would you run from me?\u201d he asked, sounding genuinely insulted. \u201cI thought I\u2019d made myself clear that I am not and don\u2019t plan to be a serial killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust you. I thought I\u2019d made myself clear about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d I shot back.</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t know me last night when you drove me away from a crime scene and doctored me up. What\u2019s different this morning? I just want to help you the way you helped me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so important to you to help me? You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you helped me, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he countered. \u201cI mean, I was hurt. It didn\u2019t turn out to be as bad as you thought it was, but without you fixing me up, I would have been pretty bad off . . . right?\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded strained, as if it was important that I believed him.</p><p>Caleb cleared his throat, interrupting my mental telemarketing tangent. \u201cLook, you need a ride south. I am heading in that direction. I need to make a few stops along the way. I just want to know that you get there OK. In the last twenty-four hours, you\u2019ve dodged a random shooting and slithered through a bathroom window for no reason. You need someone to watch out for you.\u201d I arched an eyebrow, prompting him to add, \u201cAnd maybe you can watch my back, too.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips, considering exactly what watching Caleb\u2019s back could entail. I would imagine it involved more than just staring at his jean-clad butt, as tempting as that prospect was. His offer would solve my selling-organs-to-obtain-transportation issue. I liked my organs where they were, so this was a much more attractive option. \u201cWhat does \u2018eventually\u2019 mean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJust a few stops.\u201d</p><p>I brushed the gravel from my jeans, considering. All of the reasons I ran from Caleb at the diner were still very valid. And he clearly knew I didn\u2019t trust him, which had weakened that polite fa\u00e7ade we had going for that brief morning interlude. But he was part of Maggie\u2019s pack. Every story I\u2019d ever heard about \u201cCousin Caleb\u201d had involved his honesty and all-around good-guy-ness. On the other hand, he could still be just as ruthless and cash-hungry as his job self-description implied . . .</p><p>Oh, screw it, it\u2019s not like I have a better choice. I was in the middle of nowhere, without transportation, money, or supplies. I was up shit creek without a paddle. I didn\u2019t even have a canoe at this point. But I\u2019d be darned if I was going to admit that.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I sighed, gesturing toward the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be this excited about everything?\u201d Caleb asked as he hitched my bag over his shoulder and we ambled toward the truck.</p><p>\u201cI can drive, you know,\u201d I told him as he climbed in. \u201cObviously, not when I\u2019m in exhaustion-related hysterics, but we could switch off, to make it easier on you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned across the seat to open my door, informing me solemnly, \u201cNo one drives my truck but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t seem to mind when I was hauling your ass away from explosions and gunfire,\u201d I muttered, slamming the passenger door.</p><p>\u201cSpecial circumstances.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a weak glare while nudging his bag of law-enforcement equipment with my foot. \u201cDo I get to play with your big bag of toys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you do not.\u201d I crossed my arms over my chest and frowned, so he added, \u201cBut you can keep the baton, as a gesture of good faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou noticed I took it, huh?\u201d</p><p>I would have described the over-the-sunglasses eye roll he sent me as a \u201cbitch, please\u201d gesture, but so far, he didn\u2019t strike me as the type of guy to use that sort of facial-expression language, so . . . I would just stick to being embarrassed at being caught so easily.</p><p>Clearly, I needed to brush up on my sleight of hand.</p><p>\u201cSomeone looking for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes, but continued as if I hadn\u2019t answered. \u201cDo you want them to find you?\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, my expression completely flat, prompting another werewolf eye roll.</p><p>\u201cOK, then. Well, before my little detour at Flapjack\u2019s, I was on my way to scoop this guy, Jerry Stepanack, up from Flint Creek. That\u2019s about two hours from here, so you didn\u2019t cost me too much time,\u201d he said, ignoring the way I rolled my own eyes at that statement. \u201cJerry\u2019s none too bright, and there\u2019s a pretty healthy price on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d I asked. \u201cAnd I am assuming this is not an assignment from legitimate law-enforcement authorities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo answer the first question, you don\u2019t want to know, and to answer the second, you really don\u2019t want to know,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a word to the wise, sweetheart. If you borrow lots of money from bad people to buy a couple of tow trucks so you can steal cars and sell them for parts, don\u2019t default on the loan and sell the trucks for parts. It makes those bad people cranky.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, sliding my oversized sunglasses onto my nose, and settled back into the seat. \u201cI\u2019ll try to keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>4</p><p>All the Best Friendships Start with Lost-and-Found Underwear</p><p>It turned out Caleb\u2019s job was mostly driving around and talking on his cell phone.</p><p>I spent the first fifteen minutes of our \u201cbusiness arrangement\u201d gathering the foam coffee cups and jerky packets from the floorboards and stuffing them into an empty grocery bag. Caleb insisted that I keep the gas receipts, as he needed them for expense reports, so I stacked them in the glove compartment.</p><p>Cue the wolfy eye roll. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to spend the next few days sitting around in filth.\u201d</p><p>The drive reminded me of why I\u2019d fallen in love with living in Alaska in the first place. After spending so many years closing myself up into safe, cramped corners, the wide-open spaces were a welcome remedy to my growing claustrophobia. I loved the crazy patchwork of foliage across the landscape, the expected greens mixed with a riot of purples, golds, and grays. All of this would be buried under a dense blanket of blinding white in a few weeks, but even that would be beautiful and welcome.</p><p>I finally got to see some of the country, now that I wasn\u2019t always on the run. Some of it looked too beautiful to be real\u2014purple stone mountains and trees that seemed to swallow the road whole and forests so thick no light could break through the evergreens. I loved never knowing when a little town was suddenly going to pop up around a bend in the road. Caleb seemed to know this road like the back of his hand. I had the idea that if he\u2019d driven down a road just once, he would still be able find his way back and tell you in detail what sort of rocks he\u2019d seen by the side of the road.</p> <p>I would miss this landscape. I didn\u2019t know where my new identity would take me. I knew it wasn\u2019t likely that I would stay in the Great North. And the southeast was definitely out\u2014too close to Glenn. I could only hope that I wouldn\u2019t end up in the desert somewhere. I had come to love the snow. I just couldn\u2019t handle one-hundred-plus-degree summer days and scorpions in my living room.</p><p>We wound through rolling, low-lying mountains lightly dusted with snow, the landscape laid out before us like an endless Christmas card. I wrestled with the fatigue I\u2019d kept at bay over the last twenty-four hours. But between the warm truck, the full belly, and the late-afternoon sun beating through the window on my face, I fell asleep long before we arrived in Flint Creek. It had been a long time since I\u2019d simply ridden along in a car, and the exhausting events of the last few, well, years caught up with me. I still slept lightly, waking with every turn Caleb made, checking to make sure he hadn\u2019t driven us to Tijuana or taken liberties with my ChapSticks. But he hadn\u2019t even changed the radio station. He just glanced in my direction every few minutes, frowned, and then turned his attention back to the road.</p><p>Resting my forehead against the warm glass, I wondered if there would be an opportunity to send an e-mail to my Network contact, \u201c</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ .\u201d I needed to explain that my situation had deteriorated quickly and ask for a rush job on my new identity. Red-burn was pretty good about responding to e-mails within twenty-four hours, so all I had to do was come back the next day to buy more Internet time.</p> <p>Although I\u2019d never met her, Red-burn had been instrumental in my move to Alaska. She worked as part of the Network, a widespread group of people who helped women escape from abusive domestic situations, particularly when those situations involved stalking. Operating beneath the radar of law enforcement, the group arranged for new, untraceable driver\u2019s licenses, social security numbers, and birth certificates in new names, not to mention securing employment and housing. They were discreet, well funded, and frighteningly good at making people disappear.</p><p>After leaving Glenn, I\u2019d bounced around the country for nearly a year before I heard about the Network from a fellow waitress. Red-burn was the one to connect me with the Crescent Valley job, informing me that the people in Crescent Valley, Alaska, needed a new physician, as the old Dr. Moder had retired.</p><p>I was pretty annoyed with her for failing to mention the whole werewolf issue. Of course, she didn\u2019t know about it, but still, I reserved the right to be irritated. A Dr. Moder had treated the valley\u2019s residents since before the government started insisting on all of those pesky birth and death records. In addition to dramatically shortened pregnancies and high fertility rates, were-wolves tended to die in violent, somewhat difficult-to-explain ways, such as disagreement with a large bear while in wolf form. Eventually, census boards and medical examiners start to pick up on those things. It was easier for the pack to have someone they could trust to file the important papers. The first Dr. Moder took the position in 1913, but when he died, his successor didn\u2019t have a strictly legal medical license, so the pack simply passed his credentials along to make it seem as if the original Dr. Moder was still working. My predecessors were like me, medical professionals who\u2019d inadvertently ended up on the wrong side of the legal line. The name \u201cDr. Moder\u201d stuck and became a tradition. (I suspected that we all shared the same degree from a medical school in the Philippines.) The Dr. Moder just before me had testified against a prescription-pill mill linked to organized crime in Miami. She\u2019d hidden in the valley for ten years before she felt comfortable moving back to the lower forty-eight.</p><p>Red-burn was the one to convince me that I was strong enough to move so far away, to a cold, alien place where I would be isolated from anything I knew. She was the one who called me the night before my cross-country drive and told me not to be a wuss. Red-burn believed in tough love. She told me about her own past abuse. Although she was happily married to a much nicer guy, she still regretted that she hadn\u2019t been brave enough to leave on her own terms. So now she helped other people escape their bad relationships and felt as if she was taking some of her power back, bit by bit. She was funny and sweet, but she brooked no bullshit. She insisted that I do half the work to get myself moving, telling me I wouldn\u2019t appreciate my safety without a little effort.</p><p>Then again, it was Red-burn who had sent me the e-mail warning me that there had been a not-elaborated-upon but still quite scary \u201cdevelopment\u201d with my ex-husband. She said it was time to pull my \u201cescape hatch,\u201d my preplanned departure route that we had put in place before I even moved to the valley, while she worked on establishing a new place for me. That did secure some of my loyalty.</p><p>And run I did, tout de suite. I took my truck, which technically belonged to the village, and drove it as far as Grundy. I left it in the care of Nate Gogan, the town lawyer, whom I could trust to get it back to Maggie, and I tricked him into accepting twenty dollars for his trouble and gas money, which officially earned me attorney-client privilege and kept him from giving Maggie any details. I hitched a ride to Dearly with Evie, who had to make her weekly run for supplies. I gave her some excuse about needing to pick up some prescriptions and then disappeared through a side door of the pharmacy. I walked to the nearest used-car lot and plunked down seven hundred dollars for my poor departed Pinto. Of course, if I\u2019d known I was buying an extremely expensive incendiary device, I might have upgraded to a Camry.</p> <p>I drove as far as I could trust the Pinto to take me, camping out in McClusky and getting the job at Emerson\u2019s while I waited for Red-burn to come up with a new identity for me. I shivered, tucking the collar of my coat closer to my chin. Although it was early autumn, the first hard frost wasn\u2019t too far off. And that meant winter, with its rural-road-crippling snows and blood-freezing temperatures, was nipping at my heels. In the valley and the nearby town of Grundy, the first frost meant a big party to celebrate the last opportunity the locals would have to see one another socially before the snows set in and isolated them in their homes. Now it meant I had precious few weeks to get my butt to Anchorage and then haul ass across the state to wherever the Network had established a place for me. There were definitely times I despaired having to travel relatively close to the valley after \u201cpulling my escape hatch\u201d and running all the way east, but Anchorage was my checkpoint and that\u2019s where I would go.</p><p>I would miss this. I would miss living in my cozy little house on the edge of the valley. I would miss the thrill of first snows of the season and the relief of the spring thaw. I would miss the irreverent, unpretentious humor of the pack members. I would miss the magic of watching people I shared a post office with shifting from two legs to four and back.</p><p>No, I thought, practically whacking myself on my nose with an imaginary newspaper. No reminiscing. None of this mattered. I\u2019d left the pack to protect them, not so much from Glenn\u2019s violence\u2014that hadn\u2019t come until the end of our marriage\u2014but from his intrusion.</p><p>If he wanted to, Glenn could make life for Maggie\u2019s pack very difficult. He could compromise the pack\u2019s municipal bank accounts, causing the community considerable hardship. He could go to the authorities and raise all sorts of questions about \u201cDr. Moder\u201d and how someone with the same credentials had managed to practice in the valley for so many years, essentially preventing the pack from getting medical treatment. He could call attention to discrepancies in the pack\u2019s birth and death records. He could point out the number of mysterious disappearances involving drug dealers and other undesirables who wandered too close to the pack\u2019s territory. He could put the pack\u2019s secret in serious jeopardy. And after everything the pack had done for me, I simply would not allow that to happen. The pack had survived for hundreds of years without exposure to humans. I wouldn\u2019t let my crazy ex-husband ruin that streak.</p><p>And if I told Maggie what I was going through, she would insist on \u201copening a werewolf-sized can of whoop-ass\u201d on Glenn, and that would bring up a whole new set of problems for an alpha already stretched pretty damn thin by integrating two packs and a recent marriage. And I certainly didn\u2019t want to complicate the pack\u2019s ability to hire a new Dr. Moder, not with so many couples from the newly merged packs expecting cubs. There were plenty of doctors out there who could take my place as Dr. Moder, doctors without my baggage. It was easier for everyone if I just removed myself from the equation.</p><p>Caleb gently jostled me awake in the late afternoon and led me stumbling into another dingy room, this time at the Flint Creek Motor Inn. I chose not to comment on the lone queen-sized bed. I was too tired to protest the possibility of spooning with Bitey McWolfPants again. Caleb practically had to tuck me into bed like a toddler, pulling off my shoes as he explained in his gravelly voice that he needed to talk to some local contacts about Jerry. I stayed up long enough to lock the door behind him and promptly fell asleep again in the squeaky little motel bed.</p><p>It was the dream of my darling former husband that woke me up, the dream of him breaking down my motel-room door. I was screaming and screaming for help, but no sound was coming out as he dragged me away. I sat up, making a strangled whimper, clawing at the imagined hands at my throat.</p><p>I sprang out of bed into the dark, empty room. I blew out a breath and pushed my hands through my short, snaggled hair, then padded to the door to check the lock again. I shook my head and wondered whether I was going to be waking up like that for the rest of my life. But I still double-checked the bolt.</p> <p>Better safe than sorry.</p><p>I crawled back into bed, pulling the covers up to my chin. How had I sunk to trusting my security to a cut-rate dead bolt? I used to be a pretty nice girl, back when I was Tina Campbell-Bishop, M dramatic pause D. I had everything. A nice husband. A nice home. A promising career. And I walked\u2014well, ran\u2014away from all of it. All the things I took for granted when I was growing up, such as feeling safe, having an indoor place to sleep and food on the table, people being polite and taking notice of me\u2014I lost them somewhere along the way. I got harder, meaner. Rather than looking at people as human beings whom I might be able to help, I viewed them all with a calculating eye, analyzing how they might help me or hurt me before they could even introduce themselves.</p><p>Most people can\u2019t pinpoint the exact moment when everything in their life goes to shit. I consider myself lucky to have such a definite timeline, so that if I were ever given the opportunity to travel through time, I could hop into the DeLorean, drive directly to April 10, 2004, walk into the break room at the hospital, and bitch-slap myself before I could meet the new technical-support hire, Glenn Bishop. But we seemed like such a good match! It was such a sensible solution to my dry spell, a string of bad dates that made me want to see someone safe for a while. And Glenn was so accommodating, easygoing. We liked the same kinds of movies, food, and, wouldn\u2019t you know it, music. We enjoyed lazy weekends and trips to the lake. He was proud of my medical career and the energy I devoted to my work. I thought I was lucky to have fallen into a relationship with someone so easily.</p><p>I thought that\u2019s what relationships were supposed to be. My parents were married for almost forty years before they died, and in all that time, I couldn\u2019t remember them fighting. They didn\u2019t really argue, because they knew how to talk to each other and how to compromise. I thought that was what I\u2019d found with Glenn. He was sweet and attentive and dependable. He was that guy, the guy of substance your mother told you to be on the lookout for, just in case he came along.</p><p>Being with Glenn was always the easy part. The hard part was spending time with anyone else. Glenn was slight, bookish, and shy, which I sort of liked. It was a nice switch from the alpha-male types I normally went out with, burly, athletic types with dozens of friends and interests I had to compete with for attention. It was lovely to be able to have a conversation with a man without him eyeing the waitress or spotting someone across the restaurant he wanted to speak to, leaving me to fiddle with breadsticks for ten minutes while he bro-hugged some guy from his intramural basketball league.</p><p>The problem was that Glenn\u2019s shyness became my issue. He had no trouble spending hours online gaming or chatting with total strangers, but he didn\u2019t want to go to my work functions or casual drinks with my coworkers. He spent too much time around my colleagues anyway, he said, and my colleagues got enough of my precious time. Before I realized what was happening, Glenn slowly but surely made it more difficult for me to maintain friendships. He pouted when I wanted to go out with the girls, saying he never got to spend time with me. He even hid my car keys a few times so I couldn\u2019t leave, all the while claiming it was just a \u201cjoke\u201d he was forced to play because he loved me so much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course, I couldn\u2019t tell my friends, \u201cGlenn doesn\u2019t want me to spend time with you,\u201d because that made it sound so unseemly and controlling. So when I retreated from those relationships, my friends thought it was my choice. I was one of those women who can\u2019t maintain friendships after they get into a relationship. I was a Cosmo cautionary tale, in more ways than one.</p><p>As time went on, a lot of Glenn\u2019s problems became my problems. We\u2019d committed to each other, moved in together. It seemed petty and shortsighted to leave my fianc\u00e9 because he was a little needy. His demands grew so incrementally that I didn\u2019t see how unreasonable they were becoming. If I loved him, I\u2019d dress a bit more feminine, keep my hair long, cook the things he liked, enjoy staying home on the weekends the way he did. If I loved him, I would keep my personal cell phone on me at all times, even though it was against hospital policy. I would ignore the \u201caccidents\u201d I seemed to have whenever Glenn was angry with me, like tripping over his feet after an argument about rent and smacking my head against the coffee table. I would pass up the big white wedding debacle and get married on a beach in the Caribbean, which is what we did, one not-so-special weekend when I came home to find Glenn holding the plane tickets. I was the proverbial frog in the pot of slowly boiling water, dying by degrees.</p><p>And then, there were the family \u201cissues.\u201d I was an only child, a late-in-life miracle for my lovely, rational parents. We\u2019d shared a close, slightly unorthodox relationship, as my parents tended to treat me more like a small adult colleague than a child. I\u2019d been disappointed that Glenn wasn\u2019t interested in spending time with them. My parents didn\u2019t like him, he claimed. My father made him feel as if he was being interrogated for the entire visit, and my mother was too clingy with me. He caused huge fights right before we were supposed to go to family events, so that either we would skip them, or I would end up fighting off tears for most of the night, sparking tension and uncomfortable questions from my parents. It ended up being easier to tell my mother that we had other plans or that I was working. While he was mollified by my efforts to \u201cfocus on us,\u201d he grumbled that he didn\u2019t understand why I wanted to go see my parents so often anyway.</p> <p>I tried to tell myself it would take time for Glenn to warm to my parents. But then Mom was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer about two years after our wedding and passed away within six months. Dad never quite recovered from the shock, passing in his sleep a year later. I would always regret missing those last Christmases and birthdays with them. And while I couldn\u2019t blame Glenn for my failure to protect my time with my parents, I could blame him for expecting me to bounce back from their deaths as if they were just an inconvenience.</p><p>At first, I stayed because I was afraid to admit, even to myself, that my marriage was such a mistake. I didn\u2019t love Glenn. He\u2019d strangled any love I\u2019d felt for him with his insecurities and his manipulations. But I was a successful doctor, on my way up the ladder at a major Nashville medical center. Marriages that lasted less than one presidential term were not supposed to happen to women like me. I was ashamed and embarrassed and every other word that expressed world-shaking regret. When Glenn started talking about having children of our own, instead of going all warm and tender at the idea of starting a family, I panicked. I knew I couldn\u2019t be tied to him in that way for the rest of my life. So I made a clean break.</p><p>With my parents gone and my friendships damaged, nothing prevented me from moving across the country. I didn\u2019t have enough evidence for a restraining order, so I elected just to disappear. I used computers at the public library to find a new job at a hospital in Tampa and used what was left of my inheritance to set up an apartment there. I filed divorce papers and moved out before Glenn could make it home from a late-night department meeting. I used my own name to start my new life but thought I was being smart by listing a post-office box on bills and accounts. I hoped Glenn would just move on, get bored, find someone else.</p><p>As usual, I\u2019d underestimated him. He hacked into my e-mail accounts, no matter how many times I changed the address or password. I had to change my credit-card information and post-office box three times after he managed to buy some nice Jet Skis, a flat-screen TV, and a bass boat on my dime. When I complained to police in our hometown, he told them it was simply a predivorce credit spat and that we were working through it in family court. With me in another state, they were all too happy to let me fend for myself.</p><p>And still, I didn\u2019t realize how bad things could get. I\u2019d made the mistake of staying in contact with old friends. They\u2019d been so convinced by my \u201cperfectly happy wife\u201d act that most of them were shocked by the sudden shift. One well-meaning (read: ill-informed and utterly without boundaries) college friend gave Glenn my address, thinking I\u2019d given up on the marriage too quickly and should give him another chance. Having followed me through the lobby of my building and through my front door, he walked right into my new apartment and broke my jaw.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know that it was possible to hurt that badly. I could barely crawl to a sitting position as Glenn ranted and raved over me.</p><p>After Glenn let me know how much I had hurt him, he told me to wait in the bedroom while he went to fix himself a drink. He was so convinced that I would do it, he just walked out of the room, leaving me right next to a phone, and never even considered that I would use it to call for help. That chapped my butt much later, when I was in my analyze every moment so I can better blame myself phase. He was so sure of his \u201cshock and awe\u201d campaign. He was so sure I would just cower on the carpet. It never occurred to him to take the phone with him.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the first \u201caccident\u201d I\u2019d had around Glenn, but it was the first that I couldn\u2019t treat myself afterward. I called 911, and Glenn\u2014to my shock\u2014stuck around. The paramedics\u2014to Glenn\u2019s shock\u2014didn\u2019t accept his assertion that a fully dressed woman with dry hair fell getting out of the shower, so he was arrested on assault charges. I was a patient in my own hospital for two days, treated to pitying looks from my coworkers as I recovered from a broken jaw, several broken fingers, and internal injuries.</p><p>I knew what would happen when he was released. I\u2019d had him arrested. To Glenn, that was unforgivable. When I went to file a restraining order, I found that he had called some online-gaming friend and given him some sob story to convince him to post bail. Glenn skipped town, without regard for his friend\u2019s bail collateral. And when I tried to file the restraining order, I found out that Glenn had been fired from the hospital months before and moved out of our apartment. Other than his birthdate, I had no information with which to file the order, which would make it difficult to serve and enforce. If I wanted to keep this new life I\u2019d started and continue the divorce proceedings, I would have to stay put. Although I couldn\u2019t find a trace of where Glenn might have disappeared to, he would know exactly where I was. And he could come back anytime he wanted. And even if I moved somewhere new and started over, if I wanted to practice medicine, it would be impossible to hide. Hospitals and private practices expected their doctors to post profiles on their Web sites, appear in ads, and have some public presence. Trying to make myself invisible would mean the end of my medical career. Walking away from the divorce proceedings would stall them, giving credence to Glenn\u2019s claims of my mental instability and \u201ccruelty.\u201d But it had to be done.</p><p>I\u2019d learned my lesson. I checked myself out of the hospital against doctors\u2019 orders and ran. I sold everything I had, which wasn\u2019t much after Glenn\u2019s playing Russian roulette with my credit rating. I bought fake IDs and a junker car and drove in jagged lines across the country, until anyone Glenn used to find me would be so confused they wouldn\u2019t know where I was heading. I figured Alaska was as far as I could go without having to switch citizenships.</p><p>Most people try to use abandonment as a reason to dissolve a marriage. Glenn had used it as a reason to stall the divorce decree, stating that I should be present for the decision. He used the fact that I couldn\u2019t return home to keep me tied to him.</p> <p>And now, all these years later, Glenn was looking for me again. And I was running. Again.</p><p>How long was I going to live this strange, untethered half life? Would I be an eighty-year-old woman working under an assumed name in a bowling alley in Saskatoon, dreading that day my geriatric ex wobbled up to my door on his walker? Would I ever have a home again? Would I ever have a family? I was lucky to have escaped my marriage without a child. At this point in my life, a child, particularly Glenn\u2019s child, would be a liability, a beautiful burden I couldn\u2019t protect or move without worry. But the idea of never having one of my own put a cold, insistent pressure on my heart. I\u2019d delivered so many children to the valley werewolves. Then again, having a baby would mean trusting someone enough to let him see me naked, perhaps even telling him my real name. If I had to wait until I was eighty to do that, it was going to be disappointing on several levels.</p><p>Shaking off those depressing thoughts, I shuffled into the bathroom, whacking my ankle against the bed frame. I showered in the surprisingly clean bathtub, hoping the hot water would help unwind the muscles in my back and neck.</p><p>After stepping out of the shower onto an improvised washcloth bath mat, I mopped the water from my skin with the thinnest towel this side of cheesecloth. I carefully sorted through Caleb\u2019s bag, praying I wouldn\u2019t find anything else that would set off my weirdo alarm. The gray boxer shorts swamped me, but they kept me from wandering around a strange motel room bottomless.</p><p>I shrugged into an old flannel shirt of his, curled back under the covers for warmth, and buried my face in the sleeve of the shirt. I may have looked like I was wearing the latest in refugee chic, but Caleb\u2019s mossy, spicy smell made me feel . . . safe. As safe as I\u2019d felt in a long time, which, considering how little I knew of him, was disconcerting at best.</p><p>I glanced down at the soft, well-worn plaid I was wearing. You will not steal this man\u2019s shirt and shorts, I told myself. There are limits.</p><p>I was totally stealing Caleb\u2019s shirt and shorts. I\u2019d never slept more comfortably in my life. No dreams of screaming ex-husbands, confusion, and bruises. No dreams of running down the winding halls of the hospital, looking for coding alarms in a patient room, only to find that battered, flatlining patient was me. I didn\u2019t dream at all, and it was lovely.</p><p>I woke up hours later to find Caleb reading through a case file from a plastic mobile drawer I\u2019d seen earlier in the back of the truck. Each file was tagged with its own color-coded label and contained newspaper clippings, police reports, and carefully typed notes. Caleb was sitting on the uncomfortable wooden chair, stretching his long legs against the little wood-laminate dinette table. It would have been more comfortable to sit on the bed, but I appreciated that he gave me the space. He\u2019d taken the time to change into a soft blue-and-gray plaid flannel shirt and jeans. I\u2019d seen men in three-thousand-dollar tailored suits who didn\u2019t make their clothes look that good. The lamp behind his head gave his black hair a bluish corona, as if some dark paper-pushing angel had fallen to earth.</p> <p>Stupid good-looking, confusing werewolves.</p><p>He\u2019d glanced over at me every few seconds, in a pattern that took me a minute or two to pin down. Review a page, check on me, review a page, check on me. It was as if he thought I would jump out of bed and launch myself out the window if he read two pages at a time.</p><p>I sat up, blinking blearily at him. \u201cYou have very neat files.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have ink on your back.\u201d He grinned at the outraged expression on my face. \u201cI never would have expected that from a girl like you.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flushed as I pulled at the hem of his shirt, covering the dark shapes dancing up my spine. Somewhere in Indiana, I had started getting tattoos, one star for every place I\u2019d lived for more than a few nights. I\u2019d read somewhere that foster kids do that sort of thing, keeping a list of all the families they\u2019ve lived with. For me, it was a galaxy of tiny stars swirling along the ridges of my spine to remind myself of the number of times I\u2019d managed to start over.</p><p>I\u2019m not generally a superstitious person, but all this stuff started happening to me less than a week after I added the thirteenth star for McClusky, Alaska.</p><p>\u201cLucky star, my butt,\u201d I muttered, knowing Caleb probably heard me but not really caring.</p><p>\u201cI made some calls to Emerson\u2019s and the motel where you were staying,\u201d he said in a faintly bored tone, without looking up from his files. \u201cBelinda is worried about you, and the state police want you for questioning in connection with the explosion in the parking lot. I told her I was your parole officer. She wasn\u2019t surprised, by the way, figured anyone as quiet as you had to have some sort of past. But other than that, she\u2014and the motel clerk\u2014had nice things to say about you. Hard worker, dependable, honest but cagey.\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flushed hot. I supposed I should have expected him to check out my story. He was a sort of semi-private-investigator with a secret supernatural lifestyle. The man had trust issues. Still, the recovering wife inside of me resented the intrusion. I didn\u2019t like people checking up on me. Better not to bring it up. Better to ignore it and distract him with something else, avoid an argument.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Belinda mean by \u2018cagey\u2019?\u201d I grumbled to myself. \u201cJust because I didn\u2019t blab all of my personal problems doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m cagey. I thought we were friends.\u201d</p><p>Caleb smirked at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m discreet,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cRabbit, I know cagey. And trust me, you\u2019re cagey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmph. Where were you while I was in my coma?\u201d I asked, wiping at my face, because I was pretty sure I could feel dried drool patches on my cheeks. That was unfortunate, because Caleb was staring at me. Really hard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA bar down the street,\u201d he said. \u201cThe owner is a friend of mine, and I thought he might have some information about Jerry. Nothing happens in this town without him knowing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour friend is a big gossip?\u201d I asked as he held out a foam cup of lukewarm coffee, with little packets of sugar and creamer stacked carefully on top, which I drank greedily. It was bitter and tasted a little like battery acid, but it was also caffeinated. I would take what I could get.</p><p>\u201cBartenders are like priests armed with truth serum. People tell them everything,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Len ever decides to start a blog, every marriage in Flint Creek will\u2014poof\u2014dissolve, just like that.\u201d</p> <p>I snorted an unladylike amount of coffee up my nose at the thought of a rural Alaskan bartender turning Gossip Girl. The coffee splashed down my neck, soaking into the front of his shirt. I blotted at it with a minuscule paper napkin. The intensity of his stare as he watched me dab at my chest made me feel . . . warm, fluttery sensations I had not felt in a very long time.</p><p>Get a grip, I chided myself. He was probably just irritated that I\u2019d snorked coffee all over his shirt. \u201cSorry, I find myself in clothing crisis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks better on you than it did on me, Rabbit,\u201d he said, going back to his paperwork.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what he meant by that or by calling me Rabbit. But frankly, it was probably better that we couldn\u2019t go for a shopping spree at the moment, since, well, I didn\u2019t have cash to pay for clothes and didn\u2019t want to have to ask Caleb to cover me, literally.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s too late to argue for my own room,\u201d I said. \u201cOr my own bed.\u201d</p> <p>The very idea made Caleb\u2019s mouth turn downward. He leveled me with those dark eyes and told me, \u201cYou stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s what you said this morning. But I think it would be better for me to have my own room,\u201d I said, feeling small and selfish in my request. But really, sharing a bathroom, a bed, and underwear was just a little too much intimacy with someone I\u2019d known for less than two days. \u201cAnd it still doesn\u2019t explain why I have to be your mattress buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t have any double rooms,\u201d he said, clearing his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be separated from you . . . you know, for safety reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shortage of double rooms in this state is an epidemic,\u201d I muttered, padding toward the bathroom. But since I didn\u2019t have the cash for my own room, it was hard to argue. And honestly, if he was going to hurt me, he would have done it already. He\u2019d had ample opportunity.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a spare toothbrush in my bag,\u201d he called after me.</p><p>How had I missed that in my digging through his duffel? Giggling like mad, I scampered back to his bag to search again. I felt ridiculously grateful at the thought of being able to brush my teeth. This must be how people develop Stockholm syndrome.</p> <p>When I emerged from the bathroom, teeth freshly brushed, a bemused Caleb was holding out a leather duffel bag. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cI told Len that I knew a young lady who needed some clothes, and he happened to have this in his lost and found.\u201d</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief and unzipped the bag quickly, hoping the original owner wasn\u2019t particularly tall or busty. My hands swam through neatly folded jeans and a series of progressively smaller tank tops. Whoever this woman was, she had not packed for cold weather.</p><p>\u201cIt belonged to some biker\u2019s old lady. Len said she was pretty short, so I figured it would fit you.\u201d When I glared at him, he seemed confused and exclaimed, \u201cYou\u2019re not tall. This can\u2019t be news to you!\u201d</p><p>The defensive tone, so different from the voice I\u2019d heard before, martyred and resentful, made me giggle. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be something in there you can use,\u201d he said, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cI think the jeans and T-shirts might work,\u201d I told him, holding up a shirt that read, \u201cThe Booby Hatch\u2014The South\u2019s Finest Gentleman\u2019s Club.\u201d I could probably wear the panties, too, I noted, but I wasn\u2019t about to tell him that. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to wash it all first. I have my pride and parasite-free status to think of. Thanks, Caleb.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, although I couldn\u2019t tell if it was from pleasure or relief that I was, in fact, parasite-free. \u201cThere\u2019s a laundry room next to the motel office,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch of quarters in the ashtray in my truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . you spent some time with your friend Len. Now what?\u201d I asked as he plopped back into his chair, replacing his files in their neat little box.</p> <p>\u201cWell, while you were getting your beauty rest\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNecessitated by lifting someone\u2019s unconscious ass and dragging him around like a sack of wet concrete the night before,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>The corners of Caleb\u2019s mouth lifted, and he amended, \u201cWhile you were getting your much-deserved beauty rest, I visited my friend Len, who said that Jerry has been out of town but should be back tonight. I\u2019m going to go to the bar, explain the situation, tell him he\u2019s coming with us or I kick his ass in front of witnesses. He\u2019s the kind of guy who won\u2019t like that much.\u201d</p><p>It was so strange that Caleb could sit there, perfectly relaxed, and talk about apprehending someone not quite legally as if he was planning a trip to the park. For that matter, it was rather hilarious that the man whose truck floorboards were covered in a thick layer of jerky wrappers kept such meticulous files. He was vicious when threatened but had been relatively gentle with me. Caleb was a study in contradictions. \u201cAnd then?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cJerry will let me take him in, or I will actually have to kick his ass in front of witnesses. Either way, he ends up in the backseat of the truck. I arrange a drop-off point with the client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, again, is not a legitimate law-enforcement authority?\u201d I asked. He snorted but didn\u2019t answer. \u201cAnd what will I be doing during this complicated and delicate negotiation process?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be here at the motel,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my job, not yours. Just hang out, watch some TV, get some rest. You look like you could use a little more sleep.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bar. I\u2019ve worked in plenty of them,\u201d I admitted, making Caleb frown and shake his head vehemently.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll stay home and do some laundry. Darn some socks. Maybe curl my hair and alphabetize coupons while I\u2019m at it.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a dark sable brow, all the while looking terribly amused, as if I was a barky little puppy trying to intimidate him with fluff and boot chewing. \u201cYou\u2019re mocking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s sarcasm. And if we\u2019re going to spend time together, you\u2019re going to need to learn to recognize and respect it. You\u2019ll know when I\u2019m mocking you.\u201d</p><p>Hours later, my newish clothes had been washed and dried. I was now richer by several T-shirts and pairs of jeans. I\u2019d showered and even shaved my legs, a luxury I hadn\u2019t taken time for in more days than I cared to admit. Our respective duffel bags were packed and ready to be thrown into the truck at a moment\u2019s notice. I\u2019d read the one magazine I could find in this godforsaken town, a six-month-old copy of Glamour, and taken all of the quizzes. It was good to know that Channing Tatum was my celebrity boyfriend. I would definitely bring this up the next time I ran into him. A game show played on the TV as I determined what my \u201csleep style\u201d said about me (night terrors + insomnia = insane person). The low rumble of applause from the TV provided a pleasant enough background while I mulled over glossy, airbrushed vapidity.</p><p>In other words, I was bored out of my skull.</p><p>This, combined with sudden nervous fidgeting, was hell on my lips, which I chewed mercilessly. I checked the glowing red numbers on the bedside alarm clock. Caleb had been gone for almost three hours. I was getting increasingly uneasy without his warm, gruff presence in the room. What if he didn\u2019t come back? What if he decided I wasn\u2019t worth the trouble of hauling all over the state? And why was I suddenly so concerned about him not coming back?</p><p>Someday, if I ever had my career back, I would write a peer-reviewed journal article on werewolf Stockholm syndrome and its effects on hormones and mental health.</p><p>Oh, wait, that would probably get me committed to a long-term-care facility.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure when exactly I\u2019d decided to slip into the most demure of my biker-mama tops, the black V-neck T-shirt that fit like Saran Wrap, and sneak down the street to Len\u2019s bar. I\u2019d paced and fretted around the room, the growing unease settling into my chest like an acidic weight, until I suddenly found myself scampering down a dark, mostly abandoned street.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I muttered into the collar of my jacket as I braced myself against the wind. \u201cYou\u2019re running in the dark toward a bar inhabited by at least one criminal and one werewolf. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>OK, I was worried about Caleb. He\u2019d been gone for hours, and I didn\u2019t know what he was dealing with in this Jerry character. It certainly wasn\u2019t because I was afraid he was off flirting with some cocktail waitress, because that would be insane . . . right? What if he had been hurt? What if he wasn\u2019t able to get to help? The more I thought about it, the more the nervous tension constricted my chest, making it harder to breathe. I needed to see Caleb. For reasons no medical training could explain, I knew that once I saw Caleb and heard his voice, I would feel better.</p><p>Besides, the bar was just a short walk in a town that was only a few city blocks long. I had been going stir-crazy in the room. Watching Caleb in his environment might give me some insight into who I was traveling with. I worked through a couple more rationalizations before I sneaked into the bar through the employee entrance and edged my way down a dark-paneled corridor, following the noise of the barroom.</p><p>My semiprivileged upbringing hadn\u2019t acquainted me with dives like this. Despite growing up in Tennessee, home of country music and hard living, I couldn\u2019t say I\u2019d walked inside a honky-tonk until I got a job at a place in Texas called Oil Slick\u2019s. The waitresses had to wear tiny red tank tops and jeans that were practically painted on. I\u2019d never waitressed, but I still made decent tips, because the customers found my clumsiness endearing and my butt suitably heart-shaped. Gustavo, the enormous boulder-shaped bouncer who watched over the barroom, made me feel safe when the crowd got too loud and the customers got too close. The other girls were nice enough, as long as I put my share in the communal tip jar. Over the first few weeks, I perfected the art of not answering personal questions, which eventually became a vital survival skill.</p><p>But the first time a fight broke out at one of my tables, I ran to the bathroom and threw up. Being around violence like that, I just lost it. I realized it was going to be an occupational hazard, and I thought the best way to desensitize myself to it would be self-defense classes. So two stops later, in Topeka, I took a Monday-morning women\u2019s defense class at the Y. I followed it with brief stints in karate and tae kwon do. Heck, I even took a month\u2019s worth of jiujitsu before I got spooked by a fellow student whose dark hair and unsmiling blue eyes reminded me of Glenn, and I ran for Nevada. I was far from an expert. I knew just enough to defend myself if needed. I would have to enroll in a class once the Network got me settled again. For the moment, I was pretty happy with my misappropriated baton.</p><p>The music grew louder as I made my way to the barroom. It was a blend of rock and country and was very, very bad, which was almost a prerequisite in a place like this. Smoke billowed over the room, the neon from the Early American Beer Sign decor turning the fog a faint, improbable pink.</p><p>I paired up with a painfully thin woman walking from the ladies\u2019 room to the jukebox, so I could get a better look at the bar. Waitressing had taught me how to move unobtrusively through crowds. Between that and my new wardrobe, anyone who didn\u2019t know me would think I just wanted to peruse song selections with my skinny gal pal. In the glow of Hank Williams Jr. and Alabama titles, I spotted Caleb at the end of the battered oak bar. A weathered, chubby man in a dingy gray apron stood behind the bar, shaking his head as he chatted with my werewolf traveling companion. At the sight of his dark head bent over a pilsner, I took a deep breath and felt that terrible tension ease from my chest. A faint, warm, pleasant buzz spread out from my belly to my extremities, easing the wind\u2019s chill from my cheeks.</p><p>Although his back was turned to me, I saw Caleb perk up the minute I walked in. As he turned, I ducked behind a large biker making his way over to the pool table. If the Harley enthusiast noticed a tiny woman suddenly melting into his shadow, he didn\u2019t say anything. Caleb\u2019s eyes scanned the room before turning back to his beer.</p><p>For a few moments, I watched Caleb in conversation with the bartender. He was relaxed, but there was an air of menace in his posture. Whatever had happened before I arrived, he was not happy about it.</p><p>I felt something brush against my shoulder as someone moved from the front entrance toward the barroom. The contact surprised me, and I jumped, barely containing the urge to yelp. Caleb\u2019s head turned toward me again, and I scrambled into a nearby booth. Just as I sat down, a weaselly little blond man slid into the seat across from me. He seemed just as surprised to see me there as I was to see him.</p><p>The man grinned at me. \u201cWell, hey there, sweetie. How are you?\u201d</p><p>I blinked rapidly, recognizing that eager, crooked smile, the bulbous little nose. I\u2019d seen those features in the photos from Caleb\u2019s files. Somehow, I\u2019d managed to grab a booth with Caleb\u2019s quarry. And he seemed to think my rapid blinking was some sort of eyelash-batting gesture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fan-freaking-tastic.</p><p>5</p><p>The Misadventures of Alcoholus Moronicus</p> <p>If I jumped out of the booth as if my butt was scalded, Caleb would probably notice. If I tried to slink away quietly and offended Jerry, making a scene, Caleb would probably notice. All I had to do was humor this moron for a minute or two and then hightail it before\u2014</p><p>Crap. Caleb had noticed.</p><p>And from across the room, he did not look happy. He stood, moving swiftly around the tables, approaching Jerry from behind. I shook my head slightly, prompting Jerry to ask, \u201cEverything OK, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>Caleb frowned, and I drummed up the ditzy-blonde voice I\u2019d perfected at Oil Slick\u2019s. \u201cHi! Do you mind if I sit here?\u201d</p><p>Jerry\u2019s dim but perfectly friendly grin was back. \u201cWell, since you already are, I don\u2019t mind at all. Can I buy you a drink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have whatever you\u2019re having,\u201d I said, smiling sweetly.</p><p>He hollered, \u201cBeer!\u201d across the barroom, which prompted a rude gesture from the bartender. Jerry turned back to me. \u201cWell, look at you. Here I thought I\u2019d met all the pretty girls in town. You\u2019re new around here, huh?\u201d</p><p>Right, right, idle chitchat. I can do this, I told myself. I could keep Jerry pleasantly distracted and maybe even get him outside, where Caleb could intercede without causing a loud, violent scene. Jerry didn\u2019t seem like a sleaze, which helped considerably. He just seemed like a rather sad, lonely guy who had very bad judgment regarding auto loans and business transactions. Part of me sort of wanted to help him escape out the back door. I smiled, although the expression was a bit shaky, and leaned across the table toward him.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriend and I just blew into town a few days ago. But I can\u2019t seem to find him. I guess I\u2019ll just have to spend my time with you.\u201d I slowly walked my fingers up his denim-clad arm.</p><p>\u201cWell, his loss is my gain, sweetie. I\u2019ll just get us some drinks.\u201d Jerry waved his arms in the direction of the bar and frowned. \u201cLen doesn\u2019t seem to be cooperatin\u2019,\u201d he said, frowning slightly at the bartender, who was pointedly ignoring him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go get you that beer?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, all sweetness and light. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>He sauntered toward the bar, grinning at me the whole time.</p><p>Now was probably a good time to run. As nonsleazy as he seemed, Jerry could try his own luck with Caleb. When he turned his back to me to order, I hopped up from the table, made toward the back exit, and ran right into Caleb.</p><p>There\u2019s nothing like a face full of pissed-off werewolf to get your adrenal responses going.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Caleb hissed, dark eyes flashing faintly golden as he wrapped his fingers around my wrist and pulled me toward the corridor. Although he clearly wasn\u2019t messing around, his grip wasn\u2019t tight enough to hurt, and I felt insistently guided rather than dragged against my will.</p><p>\u201cI got bored,\u201d I whispered, in an effort not to attract Jerry\u2019s attention. \u201cAnd then I got here, and it all just sort of spiraled out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to stay at the motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to grasp why,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry. I got anxious when you didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>And I grasped exactly how needy that sounded as the words came out of my mouth. Maybe if I started drinking, I would develop some sort of verbal filter around this man.</p> <p>A fleeting, pleased look flashed across his face, just before another more lasting look of . . . guilt? That seemed like a strange response to an awkward admission of semifondness. He cleared his throat and pushed me away, against the wall, until there was enough room to make the dance chaperones at my old high school happy.</p><p>\u201cLook, Anna, I think we should talk.\u201d</p><p>And then, of course\u2014</p><p>\u201cUh, hello?\u201d Jerry asked, returning with beers in hand. \u201cIs this your boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I gave a very startled Caleb an uneasy glance and mumbled, \u201cUmmm . . .\u201d</p><p>Even I am amazed by my own smoothness sometimes.</p><p>Caleb was the first to snap out of whatever bad-decision haze was circling our heads, drawling, \u201cYeah, this is my girl. And she doesn\u2019t need anybody buying her beers but me.\u201d He slid his arm around my waist and pushed me behind his broad back.</p><p>Resigning myself to being the mewling damsel in this messed-up situation, I dropped my forehead against the back of Caleb\u2019s jacket and sighed, before loudly protesting in full-on Southern drawl, \u201cAw, baby, he didn\u2019t meant anything by it!\u201d</p><p>Jerry raised his hands, spilling the better part of the beer down his shoulders. \u201cHey, man, she sat down with me. I didn\u2019t mean any harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna talk about this outside?\u201d Caleb growled as I backed toward the employee exit and calculated my chances of bolting for the motel room and avoiding the inevitable fiasco of fisticuffs. And frankly, my feelings were a little hurt that Jerry had thrown me over so quickly when faced with my pissed-off \u201cboyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Defensive and agitated, Jerry retorted, \u201cHey, maybe if you were taking care of her at home, she wouldn\u2019t have to go looking for it elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Caleb barked, grabbing a handful of Jerry\u2019s blue-jean jacket and rattling him back and forth. \u201cNow I\u2019m kicking your ass!\u201d</p><p>I let out a plaintive wail, as if I couldn\u2019t believe our lovely evening on the town was being ruined by such barbarism.</p><p>Jerry clawed at Caleb\u2019s hands, trying to wriggle loose, like a worm on a hook. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not even worth it, man.\u201d With that, he managed to jerk away from Caleb\u2019s massive hands and turned to walk away.</p><p>Now, having spent some time around the male barfly, or Alcoholus moronicus, I\u2019d learned to recognize the signs when a guy was faking walking away from a bar fight so he could sucker-punch his opponent. I was about to shout a warning, but Caleb apparently recognized those signs, too, because when Jerry turned to whip his beer at Caleb\u2019s head, both of us had already stepped out of the way, leaving the bottle hurtling toward the large barback, who had just carried a keg through the employee entrance behind us. Thinking Caleb was the beer tosser, the barback took a swing at him. But instead of hitting Caleb, the punch landed right in the face of an old, grizzled trucker type, whose partial denture plate went flying out of his mouth and behind the bar.</p><p>The toothless trucker was none too pleased about this development and dived at Caleb and the barback. Caleb moved to push me out of the way, but I\u2019d already ducked, naturally falling into step with the waitresses. They tended to tuck away into a safe corner until the fists and flying objects stilled. And considering the way the fight seemed to spread throughout the barroom like a virus, those objects would likely remain in motion for some time.</p><p>Caleb had ducked the barback\u2019s first punch but caught the second on its upward swing at his chin. Although it would have been better to keep moving, I was transfixed by the grace with which Caleb moved that massive, powerful body around; sidestepping and dodging like a matador, all the while tracking Jerry over his shoulder so the little weasel couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>The physician in me couldn\u2019t help but tally the injuries. Caleb\u2019s emergency-room bill would have been considerable if he wasn\u2019t going to heal up automatically. His effort to keep watch on Jerry kept getting him punched in the face. I could hear the bridge of his nose crack under the pressure of the barback\u2019s fist, not to mention two fractured ribs and a split in the skin over his left cheek. Across the barroom, I saw an old, wizened trucker flip another onto a scarred pine bar table hard enough to break his clavicle. And a fireplug of a waitress brought her tray down on the trucker\u2019s head so hard he was going to have at least a minor concussion.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jerry was picking his way across the room, around the flying fists, and seemed to be ducking toward the front door. And Caleb was too distracted by the painfully thin jukebox woman biting his arm to notice.</p><p>I scrambled across the room with all the grace of a drunken gazelle and cut Jerry off before he reached his escape route. OK, brain, what are you doing? You don\u2019t approve of Caleb\u2019s job, and you don\u2019t know Jerry, so why are you trying to come up with a distraction to keep him from getting away?</p><p>\u201cIf you wait a minute, I\u2019ll show you my boobs.\u201d I blurted out the words, stopping Jerry in his tracks.</p><p>What?</p><p>Jerry had the exact same reaction, blinking rapidly at me as he spluttered. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>This was the brilliant distraction you came up with? I seethed at my cerebral cortex. How did you get me through medical school? I could only blame the bad influence of the biker-babe clothes.</p><p>\u201cD-did you say you\u2019d show me your boobs?\u201d Jerry spluttered nervously, as if he was on the verge of giggling.</p><p>I scanned the room for Caleb, who was now being detained by the headlock the three-hundred-pound barback was putting on him. And now I was on the edge of panic, because there was no way I was flashing this guy. I did not spend four almost homeless years avoiding a pole\u2014despite several potentially lucrative offers\u2014to start publicly baring skin now. I had backed myself into a corner, in terms of negotiations. I would have to keep this in mind for future bar fights. \u201cMaybe just one.\u201d</p><p>Behind Jerry, there was a flash of familiar plaid. At some point during my mammary-related musings, Caleb must have shaken off the angry barback, because he was now creeping up behind Jerry, holding a finger to his lips, and brandishing a purloined pool cue. I grimaced, as if in heavy consideration.</p><p>Jerry was about to protest this bargain when Caleb crept up behind him and whacked him over the head. If Jerry had any friends who might have objected to him being whacked over the head and then packed out of the bar like baggage, they were too caught up in the fight to notice.</p><p>Caleb wasn\u2019t even winded by the brisk walk back to the truck under the added burden of hauling a grown man. While I leaned against the passenger door, trying to catch my breath, Jerry was tucked into the truck as meticulously as a newborn babe. Caleb raised the metal gate between the front and back seats of his truck and carefully cuffed Jerry\u2019s arms to the ceiling handle, zip-tied his feet, and gagged him with a bandanna. It was disturbing how quickly Caleb accomplished this, as if he was the feature act in some sort of criminal rodeo. But he seemed pretty angry, so angry that he didn\u2019t even speak when he stopped at the motel to let me grab our bags and check out. Apparently, leaving me in the truck with a wanted man wasn\u2019t something he was willing to do, even if the man was unconscious.</p><p>I packed up in record time, although I stared longingly at the bed as I marched our bags out of the room. I\u2019d really been looking forward to sleeping in the same room two days in a row.</p><p>Story of my life.</p><p>Caleb was resting his forehead on the steering wheel when I opened the truck door. I climbed into my seat, and there was a long, awkward silence after I buckled my seatbelt. I could only look around the newly neat interior. Who knew that the floorboards were maroon? I was contemplating whether I could get away with buying one of those little plug-in air fresheners at the next rest stop when Caleb finally raised his dark head, his features completely wooden as he deadpanned, \u201c \u2018If you wait a minute, I\u2019ll show you my boobs\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt worked.\u201d</p><p>The tiniest hint of a smile quirked his lips, but he schooled his features into a more serious expression. He pulled the truck out of the mostly deserted motel parking lot and onto the quiet street. He grumbled, \u201cI told you to stay at the motel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny thing. It turns out that I have free will and won\u2019t just stay put when you tell me to heel,\u201d I said, throwing my hands into an exaggerated helpless posture.</p><p>He frowned at me and slid his phone out of his pocket to make arrangements for Jerry\u2019s transfer.</p><p>Jerry was silent for most of the ride, because, well, he was unconscious.</p><p>As we drove, Caleb called his clients and made arrangements to drop Jerry at a small bush-pilot operation about three hundred miles away. Caleb\u2019s clients, who remained unnamed for reasons I didn\u2019t question, would be waiting at the hangar there for us. I chose not to think about what would happen to Jerry once they had him. But given what I\u2019d read in his file\u2014which I had filched from Caleb and read with a pen light while we waited\u2014Jerry wasn\u2019t a terribly nice person, with a history of petty and not-so-petty larceny, grand theft auto, and assault. Torn by my strange connection to Caleb and my feelings of solidarity for another \u201crunner,\u201d I didn\u2019t feel good about the part I\u2019d played in Jerry\u2019s capture. I\u2019d acted out of instinct, wanting to help Caleb, to stay in his good graces. But now, the farther we drove, the more I wanted to yell for Caleb to stop the truck and let Jerry out. Or maybe just let me out.</p><p>When he finally woke up, Jerry wailed and cursed and grunted for the rest of the drive. I thought Caleb would do the Dog the Bounty Hunter thing and lecture Jerry about the bad choices that had led him here. But all he said was \u201cYou do something this stupid again, you know they\u2019re going to have me right back at your door.\u201d</p><p>Note to self: Stop making comparisons between Dog the Bounty Hunter and Caleb. He wouldn\u2019t find them amusing, and I couldn\u2019t stop picturing Caleb with a libido-killing haircut. Also, I liked to think I was above calling him Wolf the Bounty Hunter\u2014even behind his back.</p><p>\u201cInspiring,\u201d I told him, and we engaged in a battle of dueling body language.</p><p>I jerked my head toward Jerry. Caleb shrugged his shoulders. I tilted my head and poked out my bottom lip in the prettiest pout I could muster. Caleb sighed, glanced over his shoulder, and added, \u201cEat your vegetables. Say your prayers before bedtime. And give a hoot, don\u2019t pollute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook my head. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Caleb shrugged. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Unimpressed by Caleb\u2019s life coaching, Jerry seemed to exhaust himself thrashing and growling muffled insults at us and fell asleep. It seemed impossible to sleep in that position, but given his steady snores, he was apparently comfortable enough. I napped off and on, only feeling slightly guilty that I\u2019d had more sleep than Caleb in the last twenty-four hours and he was the one who was driving. Since he\u2019d sort of banned me from driving, he could just deal with it. Funny, I\u2019d had intermittent insomnia ever since I\u2019d filed divorce papers, but I was able to nod off in a moving vehicle with a werewolf and a fugitive.</p> <p>Sometime around midnight, Caleb stopped for coffee at a run-down all-night diner halfway to our destination. I woke up enough to check on Jerry, who was still unconscious, and reassemble my hair into something like a ponytail. I offered Caleb a grateful smile when he handed me a large orange juice. At that point, I wasn\u2019t sure if I could handle caffeine or coffee breath.</p><p>\u201cIt occurs to me that other than your upsetting fondness for plastic restraints and preserved meat, I don\u2019t know much about you,\u201d I said, sipping the juice and welcoming the rush of blood sugar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an open book,\u201d he said, and gave me a sunny smile that was just obscene at that hour.</p><p>And by the way, werewolves were anything but open and honest. The CIA could take lessons in discretion and misdirection from a werewolf pack. They tended to live in insular communities, separating themselves from the outside world. If humans noticed something \u201coff\u201d about a werewolf, the wolf was a master at redirecting the questioning until those humans were so confused they were no longer sure what they saw. For every odd behavior, they had a dozen plausible explanations. They shared their secrets with a few select, trusted humans, usually the ones they mated with. And for a misguided human who betrayed a werewolf clan . . . well, I don\u2019t know what happened to them. I never saw one twice. The problem with dealing with large predators is that they usually know how to hide a body from other large predators\u2014even if those large predators include state troopers.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you do in your spare time?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cHunting,\u201d he said. \u201cHiking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn outdoorsy type, huh?\u201d I asked, having just a little too much fun with the I know something you don\u2019t know game.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what about you? Any hobbies I should know about? Taxidermy? Exotic piercings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you go from taxidermy to body piercings?\u201d I asked. \u201cAlso, FYI, piercings are not a hobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never know with you wild tattooed women,\u201d he said. I shot him a dirty look. He grinned. \u201cSo what do you do for fun?\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips and resolved to do penance for my teasing with a healthy dollop of truth. \u201cDye my hair. Obtain illegal identification. Forge government paperwork.\u201d</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s expression waffled between uh-oh and wow. I didn\u2019t know whether he believed me or not. I wasn\u2019t sure whether he wanted to believe me or not. Finally, he cleared his throat and said, \u201cWell, you are an interesting girl, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I shrugged my shoulders, all innocent eyes and fluttering lashes. \u201cWhat are you running from?\u201d</p><p>That put a damper on the fluttering lashes. \u201cColumbia House Music Club,\u201d I said, recovering my snarkiness quickly. \u201cOh, sure, they say they\u2019ll sell you six CDs for a penny, but they\u2019ll hunt you down like the hounds of hell if you miss the payments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop kidding around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. A Wilson Phillips CD ruined my life.\u201d</p><p>I was treated to yet another Caleb expression to add to the catalogue, the halfhearted I\u2019m getting really tired of your shit, woman glower. Normally, a glare like that would have me retreating a bit, at least leaning back in my seat. But there was no heat in Caleb\u2019s stare, just frustration and a touch of irritation. Somewhere in my chest, a little pressure valve opened up, and I was able to release a breath I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d been holding.</p><p>Contrite, I told him something real. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to talk about it yet. All you need to know is that I need to get to Anchorage to pick something up. It\u2019s nothing illegal. I don\u2019t have any warrants. After that, I don\u2019t know where I will be going.\u201d</p><p>Caleb muttered something I couldn\u2019t make out, frowning into the distance. Well, if there was any way to kill a fun, flirtatious conversation, that was it. We rode along in silence for a mile or two.</p><p>Desperate to recover the previous mood, I said, \u201cOK, lightning round. Siblings or only?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly,\u201d he answered. Of course, I knew that. Only children were such a rarity in the hyperproductive pack that the wolf-aunties were sure to tsk over \u201cpoor Caleb,\u201d all alone, the last of his line, handling the details of his father\u2019s death by himself.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mother, a human, had abandoned him and his father when Caleb was just a little boy, I remembered now, which had been quite the scandal in the little valley community. Did the lack of brothers and sisters make it easier for Caleb to leave the packlands and wander by himself? As a cub, he would have had plenty of kids to run around with, cousins upon cousins to keep from being lonely. But still, after his father died, I could imagine Caleb feeling his connections to his fellow wolves fading.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but feel a little sorry for him. Running with other wolves was supposed to be one of the best parts of being a werewolf. How often was he able to shift out here on his own? How did he avoid hunters and game wardens or running afoul of locals? Shifting alone was considered a big no-no in the valley. The more time a wolf spends with the pack, the clearer his memories during the phasing. There was a sort of collective memory among the wolves, which could be unfortunate, given some of the stupid stuff some of them were known to pull while on four legs. Shifting solo could lead to a werewolf waking up in human form, naked, in a grocery store parking lot two hundred miles from home. (It had happened to Maggie.) Or suspected of eating hikers. (It had happened to Cooper.)</p><p>I cast a sidelong glance at Caleb. How long had it been since he\u2019d been able to run? Werewolves had to shift every once in a while just to get the \u201cwolf wiggles\u201d out. Maggie told me once that her kind tended to get pretty cranky if they went too long without phase. It would explain Caleb\u2019s occasionally less-than-sunny demeanor.</p><p>It seemed my little mental vacation had taken longer than I thought, because Caleb was looking at me expectantly. Oh, right, I was supposed to be participating in car games, not pondering werewolf PMS. Cheeks flushing, I cleared my throat and asked, \u201cCollege?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPast felonies?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIs public nudity a felony?\u201d</p><p>Wrinkling my nose, I asked, \u201cBiggest phobia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRussian nesting dolls. I\u2019ve always hated those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you think the tiny baby doll inside could be made of pure evil?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d He managed to say it without a hint of irony.</p><p>\u201cRambo or Rocky?\u201d</p><p>He scoffed. \u201cTerminator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, the correct answer was John McClane,\u201d I told him, shaking my head. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel this quiz is unfairly skewed toward Bruce Willis fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad. I stopped speaking to a friend for a month when she suggested Love, Actually was a better Christmas movie than Die Hard,\u201d I told him. It was true. My relationship with Mo was very strained until she brought me chocolate chess squares as a peace offering.</p><p>\u201cSpringsteen or Def Leppard?\u201d</p><p>He fist-pumped in mock triumph. \u201cNeither. The correct answer is Garth Brooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can be friends anymore,\u201d I told him.</p><p>That obscenely sunny smile made another appearance. \u201cWell, at least you admit that we\u2019re friends in the first place.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cFootball or basketball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurling,\u201d he insisted, and when I burst out laughing, he added, \u201cI can\u2019t help it! It\u2019s weirdly compelling. Those poor guys out there on the ice with their little brooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no problem with that,\u201d I promised him. \u201cChunky or creamy?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cWow, I hope you\u2019re talking about peanut butter.\u201d</p><p>And so it continued for almost an hour, with Caleb attempting to ask me reciprocal questions. I dodged all but the most trivial, giving him bits and pieces of information that couldn\u2019t come back to bite me. Bruce Willis. Florence and the Machine. Born in Kansas. (A lie.) Chicago Cubs fan. (Also a lie. Go, Cardinals.) Chunky over creamy. (True. It was the only way to keep my chunk-phobic father out of my Jiffy stash.) I avoided questions about schooling, employment, past relationships, even the places I\u2019d traveled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much time for vacations,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cNot even when you were a kid?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cMy family didn\u2019t travel much.\u201d Another lie. My relatively well-off parents had taken me on wonderful trips to Disney, the Grand Canyon, Mexico. We\u2019d even spent a Christmas in New York City to satisfy my mother\u2019s fascination with oversized Christmas trees. But I hadn\u2019t talked about my parents in years. And it hurt too much to talk about it casually.</p><p>\u201cStill not much of a sharer, huh, Rabbit?\u201d he asked, when I\u2019d sidestepped a question about my birthday. \u201cSee? Cagey.\u201d</p><p>I had opened my mouth to make some excuse, when an indignant squeal sounded from the backseat. Saved by the bell . . . or the tied-up felon, as it were. Muffled by the gag, Jerry\u2019s pleas for us to let him go plucked at my heartstrings, and I rolled around in my head the many alternatives to giving him to Caleb\u2019s clients. Until Jerry called me a not-very-nice four-letter word beginning with C, which came across loud and clear even with the gag. And while my sympathies cooled considerably, Caleb got angry enough that he pulled over, got a black cotton bag from his serial-killer tool kit, and pulled it over Jerry\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cYou are really good at that,\u201d I told him. \u201cTruly, disturbingly efficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI briefly considered a career as a preschool teacher,\u201d he said, chuckling when my eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cTry not to be too angry with him,\u201d I told Caleb, patting his arm gently. The gesture seemed to settle him, relaxing his shoulders and smoothing the firm set of his jaw. \u201cI would probably call me names, too, if I was in the same situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you get into this sort of situation,\u201d he retorted. And when I gave him an amused look, he added grudgingly, \u201cI would try.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. He really seemed to think he could control the universe, but I found it reassuring that he didn\u2019t seem to think he could control me. As much as he might want to lead me in one direction or the other, he seemed to have accepted that it was futile. I liked that feeling, knowing that I\u2019d shown some backbone in this bizarre situation, that I hadn\u2019t backslid to the faulty instincts that got Tina Campbell into trouble.</p><p>I decided to enjoy this small victory and keep quiet for the rest of the drive to the airstrip. Caleb had turned up a Tim McGraw CD to cover Jerry\u2019s muffled curses anyway, so further conversation wasn\u2019t necessary. I would have to list Caleb\u2019s taste in music as the chief of his personality flaws. I could forgive the overprotectiveness and the questionable job, but I drew the line at boot-scootin\u2019 music.</p><p>As our headlights flashed over the faded red Quonset-style hangar, Caleb motioned for me to slide low in my seat and slipped a baseball cap over my head, covering my face. He unbuckled and turned to me as Jerry noticed we had come to a stop and began thrashing violently.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t like being told, but trust me when I say the less these people see of you, the better. Just act like you\u2019re taking a nap or something.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, pulling my collapsible weapon of choice from my bag, but I kept it low and out of sight of the trio of burly men standing near the faded red metal building marked \u201cBird in the Bush Piloting Service.\u201d Considering the sheer size of Caleb\u2019s clients and the flash of what looked remarkably like a Russian mob tattoo on the tallest one\u2019s hand, I decided that just this once, I wouldn\u2019t be contrary. I slouched down and yawned widely, pulling the cap lower over my eyes. I would keep an ear out for any sign of trouble, but a \u201cwaking nap\u201d didn\u2019t sound too bad, either.</p><p>Jerry was deeply unhappy to be unloaded from the truck and marched across the frosted grass, if his colorful, anatomically unlikely insults were any indication. Even after his use of the unforgivable C-word, his whimpers and whining still struck a guilty chord within me. How could Caleb just go through the transaction as if he was dropping off a bag of laundry? And he was delivering it to people who would beat the absolute crap out of that laundry\u2014and that was being optimistic.</p><p>While I kept low and still in the truck, I found myself getting more agitated by the minute. What if that was me? What if some bounty hunter came and packed me up like so much luggage and dropped me at some nondescript location to return me to Glenn? Would Caleb help me? Or leave me to the bounty hunter out of professional courtesy? What would become of me if the price of selling me out went higher than the price of keeping me at Caleb\u2019s side?</p><p>I was pondering these cheerful issues when Caleb yanked the truck door open, beaming from ear to ear, and clapped an envelope into my hand. I stared down at the plain white paper, marveling at its weight. How much had he been paid for Jerry\u2019s head? How much would Glenn be willing to pay for information about me? The thought made my stomach pitch, but Caleb seemed oblivious to my queasy distress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I feel like eating a steak the size of a placemat,\u201d he crowed, pulling out of the parking lot with all due haste. \u201cAnd you, you are getting twenty percent. As much as I hate to admit it, we never would have caught up to him without your boob-showing offer.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at that and didn\u2019t reply, which caught his attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many of these jobs do you do a month?\u201d I asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cDepends on how big the payday is. Some catches are worth more than others. There are some months I only have to do one job. Why do you have that look on your face?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Without realizing it, I\u2019d been giving him a pretty healthy dose of stink-eye. I sniffed and schooled my features into a more neutral expression. I hated the timidity in my voice as I said, \u201cI don\u2019t feel good about what we just did.\u201d</p><p>I expected him to get defensive or angry. In fact, his lack of reaction was unnerving.</p><p>\u201cOther than his penchant for gender-offensive four-letter words, Jerry didn\u2019t seem like such a bad guy. And he sounded so scared. I hate to think what those goons are going to do to him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHonestly? They\u2019re probably going to do something permanent to his kneecaps. But he\u2019ll be able to walk away from it.\u201d When he saw the doubtful expression on my face, he amended, \u201cLimp away. He\u2019ll be able to limp away. The people I look for, they\u2019re not squeaky-clean, innocent souls. There\u2019s a reason they end up on my radar. It\u2019s not because they jaywalk or take more than one penny from that dish by the gas-station cash register. They\u2019ve done something serious, and that leads me right to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d I insisted. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that the information some of your less-than-reputable clients are giving you is legit. And you don\u2019t know what reasons these people may have had to do whatever it was they did to cross your path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReasons?\u201d he asked, looking mildly amused, which just pissed me off.</p><p>\u201cYes, reasons. Life isn\u2019t black-and-white. Sometimes decent people do the wrong thing for the right reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike stealing a loaf of bread to feed starving orphans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you for taking me seriously.\u201d I narrowed my eyes so dramatically I actually felt the strain on my ocular muscles. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that you never know what you\u2019re capable of until you\u2019re in dire straits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019m pretty familiar with what desperate people will do.\u201d He frowned at me, but his tone was still gentle, which was confusing.</p><p>I was questioning him, openly, so why was he being so damn nice about it? How was I supposed to predict his actions if he didn\u2019t respond the way I expected him to?</p><p>He reached across the seat to jostle my shoulder, drawing his hand away when he saw how I tensed up. \u201cIs there a reason that you\u2019re taking this so personally?\u201d</p><p>I stared out the window. There were plenty of reasons I could give him. I was taking it personally because there was someone out there looking for me. And I would want someone to take it personally if I was gagged and tagged like a freshly caught deer. Because I knew what it was like to wake up afraid. I knew what it was like to want to ask friends, family, the police\u2014anybody\u2014for help but being too scared.</p><p>But that was a heck of a hand to tip toward someone I barely knew.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t like to see people hurt, that\u2019s all,\u201d I offered weakly.</p><p>He shifted in his seat and seemed to be choosing his words carefully as we sped toward a town called Smithville. \u201cWell, that\u2019s an admirable trait . . .\u201d</p><p>I sensed an impending but.</p> <p>\u201cBut get the hell over it,\u201d he told me.</p><p>I crossed my arms over my chest with a harrumph.</p><p>Nice.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you, my moral quandary is completely resolved,\u201d I retorted in a saccharine-sweet voice that had him laughing.</p><p>\u201cWell, I know what will make you feel better,\u201d he said. When I arched my eyebrows, he waved \u201cour\u201d pay envelope. \u201cFresh underwear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry\u2019s captors gave you fresh underwear that fits in an envelope?\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>Feminine-Hygiene Products: The Ultimate in Werewolf Repellent</p><p>To celebrate our big win, Caleb took me to the exotic destination of Wall-Mart.</p><p>Please note that was Wall-Mart, with two Ls.</p><p>Given the faded sign lettering still evident on the storefront, I assumed the building had been an actual licensed Wal-Mart at some point, back before they changed their official name to Walmart. When the store closed, it appeared, some enterprising souls had just added an extra L to the sign and opened up their own discount megagrocery. The color scheme, fa\u00e7ade, and layout were the same, but all of the employees seemed careful to emphasize the extra L when they said, \u201cWelcome to Wallllllll-Mart.\u201d I assumed this was done on the advice of legal counsel.</p><p>Caleb seemed nearly giddy about this shopping spree, cart-surfing toward the ladies\u2019 clothing section. The selection wasn\u2019t exactly diverse, but I was able to find several long-sleeved T-shirts, thermals, and hoodies that I could use. I didn\u2019t want to swerve into mom-jeans territory, so I picked some yoga pants. I tossed some plain white cotton undies into the cart without comment from my werewolf shopping partner, for which I was grateful.</p><p>I hoped that the identity Red-burn created would involve living in an area with more retail opportunities. I was sincerely looking forward to wearing clothes that were not purchased in a store where you could also buy motor oil and bagged salad. As shallow as it was, I missed open-toed shoes. I missed designer labels. Heck, I missed clothes I could wear just because they were cute, not because they would protect me from frigid winds. I wanted to wear makeup again and not worry that I was attracting too much attention.</p><p>As we passed the men\u2019s section, I saw a triple-extra-large black T-shirt featuring a Field &amp; Stream\u2013style illustration of a wolf howling at the moon. I briefly considered buying it to sleep in, but I figured Caleb might find it suspiciously coincidental.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be getting a lot,\u201d he noted, as we wandered toward the health and beauty section. He nodded toward the cartload of blues, grays, and blacks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like someone else paying my way,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, you helped me snag Jerry, so part of the fee is yours, OK?\u201d</p><p>As gratifying as that was, it didn\u2019t lessen the humiliation of buying tampons in front of him. I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it for a while, but I definitely didn\u2019t want to be unprepared when it happened, particularly if it happened far from civilization. As I stood, considering the various absorbencies, Caleb seemed torn between some need to stay close to me and his excruciating embarrassment.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m just going to wait at the end of the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be best,\u201d I said as he moved toward the end display.</p><p>His eyes widened when he realized that display happened to contain a decorative array of Summer\u2019s Eve products. \u201cMaybe even in the sporting-goods section.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven better.\u201d</p><p>He practically left one of those little cartoon puffs of dust in his wake as he ran away. Apparently, protective instincts only extended so far when feminine-hygiene products were involved.</p><p>When he was far out of sight, I pondered my options. This was my opportunity to escape. I could walk right out of the store and find a ride with some willing trucker, taking the risk of being assaulted or worse. Kindly, beer-hauling, grandfatherly types willing to give favors, no questions or reciprocity required, were a rarity in the transportation community. But walking any distance in the dark, even in this relatively mild cold, was lunacy.</p><p>OK, so Caleb\u2019s job was a little\u2014a lot\u2014disturbing. And he had some strange werewolfy instincts when it came to boundaries between relative strangers. But there was something so inherently good in the way he interacted with me. He was so calm and patient and seemed to delight in even my more irritating qualities. I could handle spending time with someone who treated me like that. I doubted I would get better offers.</p><p>Right, no more getting blown around by the belches of fate. No more decisions based on panic and circumstance. I was choosing to stay with Caleb until I could make it to Anchorage.</p><p>I took a deliberate step out of the lady-maintenance aisle and toward the snack section. Caleb had snagged another cart and was filling it with pretzels, nacho chips, and, of course, venison jerky.</p><p>\u201cSo your arteries are pretty much fossilized under the weight of salt and preservatives at this point, huh?\u201d I said, eyeing the \u201cAround the World Jerky\u201d megavariety pack he dropped into the cart.</p><p>\u201cI have a strong metabolism,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThat really doesn\u2019t affect the probability of a stroke,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cWell, you\u2019re just a big pot of sunshine, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me,\u201d I said as I added granola bars to the pile and swapped the nacho chips for pita chips. Caleb bent his mouth into a disdainful frown while making a gagging sound. \u201cJust wait until we get to the produce section.\u201d</p><p>Caleb slowly but surely integrated me into his life on the road. Although I disliked how he made his living, I could see why he enjoyed it. He got all the fun of being a detective, without the pesky paperwork and professional accountability. He got to see new places, meet new people . . . and handcuff them. It was like an Easter-egg hunt for people, trying to trace their routes and figure out where they were stashed. But his job was scary, too. He was all alone out here. I was his only backup, which, given my pitiful upper-body strength, was a terrifying thought. If he got hurt, there might not be someone to help him. And while he could heal himself from most injuries, the thought of him lying alone and bleeding in a parking lot made me a little ill.</p><p>We drove for what felt like days, stopping in saloons and motels along the way, talking to Caleb\u2019s contacts, and picking up information\u2014all while I needled him to drive a little faster, to move along so we could get to Anchorage.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s ability to use his werewolf nature to pick up on his targets\u2019 scents made him seem like a human bloodhound. Knowing about his heightened senses helped me figure out how they helped him to see the minute details that the average person would miss, from trash left behind in a motel room to the depth and age of tire and shoe prints outside a target\u2019s house. And when he was interviewing people, I knew he could smell changes in their body chemistry, hormonal shifts that indicated stress or deception; he could see their eyes dilate and hear changes in their heart rates. He was a walking lie detector, which made me nervous as hell.</p><p>But he had just as many secrets to protect as I did. Caleb did his best to cover his otherworldly traits. He found reasons to be out on full-moon nights, when the urge to shift\u2014while not obligatory for werewolves\u2014was strong. He occasionally came back to the motel with dried blood on his clothes or a few feathers in his hair. I pretended not to notice, because there was no possible explanation for the feathers that wouldn\u2019t send a reasonable girl running.</p><p>He might have fooled a newbie with an untrained eye. But to someone who had lived with a pack for four years, he might as well have worn a big blinking neon sign: \u201cI\u2019m a werewolf, ask me how.\u201d</p><p>Mealtimes with Caleb were an adventure. Like any werewolf, he ate as if it was his job. Bacon, eggs, bacon, steak, more bacon. But he seemed anxious unless he saw that I was eating, too. Clearly, I could never put away as many calories as he was taking in, but unless he saw me consuming a steady stream of nutritious foods, he would nudge them onto my plate. He stopped short of doing airplane noises and trying to feed me, for which I was grateful. As much as I appreciated his concern, my jeans were getting tight, and I was running out of Tums.</p><p>Beyond the food issues, he was protective to the extreme, keeping an eye on me at all times. And while it made me uncomfortable\u2014especially when he attempted to follow me into a ladies\u2019 room\u2014part of me was reassured that he cared. He wasn\u2019t trying to keep me from leaving or keep me from meeting someone who might replace him. He was honestly concerned that there might be someone lurking around a corner, which turned out to be a reasonable anxiety at a rest stop in Layton. OK, so it was a porcupine trying to take a nap, but I doubted I could have fought it off on my own.</p><p>We drove and drove through the ever-changing landscape, through mountains and valleys, rolling flatlands. Radio stations were a matter of contention. He preferred country (country!), while I stuck to the classic-rock side of the dial. We finally found a Crosby, Stills, and Nash greatest-hits CD at a truck stop in Hanover, which satisfied us both for a while.</p><p>We would wake up reasonably early, pack up the truck, and drive to a location where Caleb would either check us into a motel or I would wait in the nearest diner while Caleb met with contacts or snooped around. In the afternoons, we would hit the road again for whatever new trail we were following. At night, we shared a bed. There seemed to be a terrible rash of motels with (a) no double rooms and (b) only one available room, meaning we had to share. I found this highly suspicious, but since Caleb never tried anything untoward, I stopped worrying about it. It got to the point where I doubted I could sleep without the warmth and weight of his body on the bed with me. The Glenn nightmares tapered off to nothing, and for the first time in years, I slept deeply and dreamlessly.</p><p>I endeavored to make myself as useful as possible, without actually helping him on those ethical-gray-area cases. I kept a bag of oranges and apples in the truck, which Caleb was happy to munch on. When I couldn\u2019t get fresh fruit, we took megadoses of vitamins C and D. Getting scurvy is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I became Caleb\u2019s personal-assistant-slash-Bluetooth, searching through files as he drove and preventing him from making phone calls that could endanger both of us. I managed to drag him kicking and screaming into the current century by finding a reasonably functional laptop and the world\u2019s smallest printer in a pawn shop near our motel in Denali. Being married to a boastful computer genius did have its advantages. I\u2019d managed to pick up a few tricks through the years, especially knowing of Web sites where you could obtain not-quite-legal information about citizens at large. So, with the portable wireless hot spot I persuaded him to buy from the cell-phone store, I was able to (a) help with Internet research and (b) avoid the Alaskan version of hipsters who frequented Internet caf\u00e9s.</p><p>They were like regular hipsters, with more flannel.</p><p>And if I happened to find lots of information about those who committed violent felonies but none about people who just owed money to the wrong people, well, that was just too darn bad.</p> <p>My new \u201capprenticeship\u201d put me in frequent contact with Caleb\u2019s \u201chome base,\u201d a bar in Fairbanks owned by Caleb\u2019s improbably named friend Suds. A former Alaska State Police trooper, Suds served as a central communications hub between Caleb and the investigators (and other less reputable entities) who hired him, passing along assignments and information. Before I showed up, they communicated primarily through phone and fax. I didn\u2019t know if Suds appreciated my \u201cinterference,\u201d but I did manage to form some sort of bond with him when I spent the better part of three hours explaining how to scan and attach documents to e-mails. I earned his respect when I tolerated the F-word three times in one sentence without getting all delicate about his language.</p><p>Since I\u2019d been \u201cpromoted,\u201d Caleb got me my own prepaid cell phone at a general store in Donwell. He said he didn\u2019t want me to have to come looking for him if he was working. But I got the idea that boredom played a factor in the purchase, particularly after he started texting me while he was \u201cin the field\u201d to keep himself entertained.</p><p>You know your life has taken a turn for the bizarre when a werewolf is sending you winky emoticons.</p><p>In consideration of his lack of computer skills, Caleb let me take over e-mail communications with his clients. I spent most of my nights in the motel rooms, alone, working on the laptop or reading, a simple pleasure I hadn\u2019t had time for until recently. I wrote up progress reports, submitted invoices, and even set up a PayPal account so Caleb could collect payments immediately from investigators working in other states. This was a purely selfish gesture. More money in Caleb\u2019s account meant a nicer class of motel room (read: motels with cable channels besides porn, but still, mysteriously, no available double rooms).</p><p>Unfortunately, Caleb took notice of my primary motive when he came back one night to find six expense reports and even more invoices ready for his signature.</p> <p>\u201cYou seem to be zipping through the paperwork at an alarming rate,\u201d he said, blinking at the sheer number of documents I had prepared.</p><p>\u201cI just like to be efficient,\u201d I said, all big eyes and innocence.</p><p>\u201cAnd it has nothing to do with your wanting me to work toward your destination just a little bit quicker?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>He slid out of his heavy jacket and kicked off his boots. \u201cWe\u2019ll get there when we get there, Rabbit, no sooner, no later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have business I\u2019ve got to take care of in Anchorage. I\u2019m anxious to get to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonal business, the kind that comes with a deadline,\u201d I retorted.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not rushing through my business so we can get to yours faster, right?\u201d</p><p>Now was so not the time to tell him that I was punting certain files to let the lesser offenders run free and clear the road to Anchorage. \u201cI\u2019m not rushing,\u201d I told him, sounding just a little more prim than I deserved to at the moment. \u201cI\u2019m streamlining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate that,\u201d he said. \u201cJust don\u2019t streamline me out of a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly. I would hate to see what you would do with your handcuffing skills as a civilian.\u201d</p><p>He stared at me, eyebrows raised. \u201cI could think of a couple of things, just off the top of my head.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cWalked right into that one, huh?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, chuckling to himself as he removed my phone from the charger and plugged his in. He didn\u2019t even glance at my screen while he removed the cord. He\u2019d never asked to see the phone. He never checked my messages or the most recent calls. He trusted me with it. Even when it was in his hands, he guarded my privacy.</p><p>And that was the moment\u2014regardless of his weird job and supernatural status\u2014when I fell just a little bit in love with Caleb Graham.</p><p>My reasons for getting Caleb a laptop had a third, even less altruistic layer of motivation. The private server allowed me to check in discreetly with Red-burn. When I went more than two weeks without an e-mail, I violated protocols and sent her an e-mail requesting a phone conference. She sent back a reply: \u201cJust this once. \u201d Which was why I loved her so much. She gave me a late-night appointment time that coincided with Caleb\u2019s meeting with one of his bar contacts.</p><p>Not knowing Red-burn\u2019s first name bothered me from time to time. This was someone who had saved and changed my life. And I wasn\u2019t allowed to know anything about her, not even the state where she was living. She could be sitting in the next building, for all I knew.</p><p>Even with Caleb safely ensconced in a bowling alley/dry goods store down the street, I felt the need to close the curtains while I waited for her call. Hearing that voice was a balm for my frazzled nerves, and for the first time in weeks, I felt that maybe everything would work out after all.</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you a voice for sore ears, or something like that,\u201d she said, giving a throaty giggle. \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty well, considering. I\u2019m just getting jumpy without updates,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo news is good news sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sighed, hoping I didn\u2019t sound too petulant. \u201cCan you at least tell me what happened? Why\u2019d you pull the escape hatch? Why now?\u201d</p><p>Red-burn seemed to consider this for a long while before finally saying, \u201cYou\u2019re famous.\u201d</p><p>My mouth went dry. The last time someone had said that to me, it was after Glenn posted clandestine shower footage of me on YouTube. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we arranged your transportation to the Great Frozen North, we did it through one of our contacts who works at the Bellingham port terminal,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s able to hide \u2018special passengers\u2019 on the manifest as unbooked rooms on the ferry.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. I already knew this. I had met \u201cCaptain Anonymous,\u201d another Network operative, at the port terminal just before boarding the ferry from Washington. He was a sweet, baby-faced blond in his twenties who gave me a bag of snacks and a Nicole Peeler paperback along with my tickets and Anna Moder information packet. I\u2019d gone straight into the ladies\u2019 room, dyed my hair dark brown over the sink, and walked out as Anna.</p><p>The five-day ride on the Northern Sea Star from Washington State to Chenega Bay had been one of the more pleasant experiences on the run\u2014clean sea air, the occasional whale sighting. Once I assured myself that Glenn was not, in fact, the guy selling hot dogs at the concession stand, it was practically a luxury cruise.</p><p>\u201cWell, the captain didn\u2019t realize that the ferry line\u2019s marketing department would be shooting photos for the company Web site during your excursion. There\u2019s a media release agreement built right into the ticket\u2019s terms of use, which most people don\u2019t read, so they don\u2019t realize that when they board the boat, they\u2019re giving permission for the company to use their image in advertising . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d I groaned.</p><p>\u201cYour picture is smack dab in the banner on their home page. It\u2019s an adorable little boy and his daddy waving bye-bye to the Washington coast as their adventure begins. You\u2019re not front and center or anything, just sort of lurking in the background, looking like one of those Old World malevolent spirits that foreshadow sea disasters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems sort of harsh,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cTwo words for you, sweetie: undereye concealer.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. It was such a normal, bitchy, girlfriend thing to say. Red-burn was caustic on occasion, but her dark humor always made me feel better somehow, as if my situation wasn\u2019t all that insane if someone could crack a joke about it.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, with the dark dye job and the haunting undereye circles, you looked so different from your picture that the captain didn\u2019t even recognize you at first, and he\u2019s on that Web site every day. So when he did realize what had happened, he went to the company\u2019s IT guy to ask about changing the photo on the Web to some other shot. The IT guy told him, \u2018You\u2019re the second person to ask about that photo this week.\u2019 He said some online image vendor inquired about that very same photo, hoping to acquire the rights to distribute it, then got downright hateful when the IT guy refused to give him information about when it was taken. Just that morning, the company Web site had shown signs of being hacked, but the only areas of the site that were improperly accessed were the image files and the ticketing information logged from the date of your departure. Security footage stored in a completely different server had also been tampered with.\u201d</p><p>My stomach rolled with the only possibility. Glenn. Glenn would have the skill necessary to get into any Web site he wanted.</p><p>\u201cBut his stumbling across a ferry company\u2019s Web site is just so random,\u201d I said. \u201cHow would he even know to look at the port terminal Web site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure, honey. Maybe he ran a facial-recognition program set to scan cached images. It\u2019s possible he\u2019s figured out where our information is stored and he got in that way. He\u2019s a persistent little bastard. Next time, try to marry someone who can\u2019t turn on a laptop on his own.\u201d</p><p>My fickle brain immediately went to Caleb. And I told my brain to mind its own business.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, the good news is that you\u2019re nowhere near that area now, and looking for you in a state that big is like looking for a needle in a . . . really large haystack with very few needles.\u201d</p><p>I snickered. \u201cDidn\u2019t think that metaphor through, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Red-burn assured me that the Network was using every resource it had to get me reestablished. We ended the call with promises that she would send me e-mails regardless of new developments. I just had to stay safe and be patient.</p><p>I felt I had staying safe covered, particularly after Caleb sewed a special pocket in the lining of my coat so I would have \u201cmy baton\u201d on hand anytime I needed it. (A werewolf with seamstress skills\u2014who knew?) But patience was a little more complicated. I knew I was falling too easily into this routine. I got used to sharing motel rooms. I got used to sharing tiny, dingy bathrooms with a man so tall he could brush his teeth behind me and still see himself in the mirror over my head. I got used to sharing greasy meals over sticky diner tables and rickety in-room dinette sets. I got used to sleeping in a bed warmed by a large body, a definite bonus considering the daily drop in temperature as we rounded the corner into October.</p><p>I learned little things, some that endeared me to Caleb, others that made me want to throw all of his Garth Brooks CDs out of the truck window. I learned that Caleb liked having his back rubbed as we fell asleep. I learned that violin music made him edgy. Like most men, he insisted that he didn\u2019t need directions, but I insisted even more forcefully that we keep track of our progress on a map.</p><p>Without mentioning them, he obviously was learning little things about me, too. He noticed the titles I liked to read and would pick up a mystery or romance paperback for me whenever he found a store that sold books. He would take the tomatoes off of my sandwiches without my having to say how much I hated them. He knew how to adjust the heat vents in the truck so that I stayed warm but not too hot.</p><p>I knew it would only last until I relocated, but it started to feel something like a normal existence. What could life be like if we were staying in one place? Would we become bored with each other? Would he realize that there were much more attractive, less emotionally damaged girls out there with whom he could make beautiful wolf-babies?</p><p>I wasn\u2019t happy that it was taking so long to reach my destination, but there wasn\u2019t much I could do about it. For now, I tried to enjoy traveling with Caleb.</p><p>Of course, there were nights when I would wake up with a warm, firm body curled around mine, and I would flinch, flipping onto my back and scooting across the bed. Caleb\u2019s arm would wrap around my waist, his grip unrelenting despite my mattress gymnastics.</p><p>Once my sleep-sluggish brain realized I was with Caleb, I would settle down almost immediately. Caleb\u2019s physical presence was like a magnet, constantly drawing me. No matter where he was in the room, I could feel the warmth of his skin radiating out and reaching for me.</p><p>He was deliberately giving me space, which I appreciated. I knew it was probably difficult for him. Were-creatures were demonstrative folk, reveling in public displays of affection where maybe only a handshake was called for. They maintained intimacy, from friendship to epic soul-mate romance, through touch. It was as though skin-to-skin contact confirmed the connection, a sort of unwritten, unspoken, I still love you enough to tolerate your questionable hand-washing practices memo.</p><p>It was diametrically opposed to his nature to avoid touching me, particularly, I suspect, after getting so cozy with me that first night. I appreciated his efforts, but at the same time, I felt more than a little frustrated by the situation. I was trusting Caleb more each day, growing more attracted to him, and he now seemed content to be snuggle-buddies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And it was slowly driving me insane.</p><p>Sex was serious business for werewolves. I knew that in most cases, it meant lifelong commitment and off-spring and all that. Part of me hoped that Caleb was the rare exception who could slip on a steel-belted-radial condom and have his way with a girl he just liked a lot.</p><p>It was a long shot.</p> <p>Then again, did the committed-werewolf-sex issue mean that Caleb had never had sex?</p><p>Werewolves were basically breeding themselves out of existence with their mated-for-life policies. Once a male impregnated a female, his DNA wouldn\u2019t mix with any other\u2019s. The same went for were-females\u2014once they had children with a male, there were no other connections to be made. It was why divorce was almost nonexistent, and widows rarely remarried within the pack. Most males didn\u2019t want to give up their chance of having children. Maggie\u2019s cousin Samson was a fantastic exception to this rule. He had adopted his wife Alicia\u2019s children as his own and was in the process of turning them into miniature knuckle-headed versions of himself.</p><p>Generally, werewolves tried to marry other werewolves, so they would be able to pass on their genes and produce little werewolves. But because of geography and the limited population, more and more wolves were marrying humans, and that resulted in more \u201cdead-liners,\u201d humans who shared all the same genes as werewolves but had none of the wolf magic. They couldn\u2019t phase and lacked the werewolves\u2019 special senses. They weren\u2019t included in pack business. Some packs considered them a source of shame, as if the diluted werewolf genes were a sign of weakness, but the Graham pack loved their dead-liners as much as they loved any relative.</p><p>Most females wouldn\u2019t risk premating sex, because they didn\u2019t want to risk being tied to someone they didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of their lives with. Some males did play \u201csex roulette,\u201d as Maggie called it, and sometimes they lost, meaning they impregnated unsuitable females and were stuck with them for life. Maggie\u2019s stance on this unfortunate practice was \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to pay, don\u2019t play.\u201d</p><p>Maggie was terribly pragmatic about this sort of thing.</p> <p>It was difficult to imagine someone like Caleb as a thirty-something-year-old virgin. But I didn\u2019t know if I was ready for that responsibility, to initiate someone into sex. Not because I was nervous about sex. I used to be not really wild but on the more adventurous side of the spectrum. I went out with my girlfriends, enjoyed the occasional protected one-night stand. But that was then. Now I was no one\u2019s idea of an ideal first time.</p><p>Unless, of course, he came out of the bathroom wearing only a towel again\u2014then all bets were off.</p><p>7</p><p>Ethical Organ Thievery</p><p>We had been driving for hours. The last time I could remember feeling my own butt was sometime before lunch. Even Caleb was starting to show some wear, hunching over the wheel and occasionally rolling his neck back and forth to hear the snap of realigning vertebrae. I reached across the seat, pleased that I could touch him so casually, rubbing the thick hair at the crown of his head, down to the nape of his neck. He leaned into the caress, a pleased chuffing noise emanating from his chest.</p><p>\u201cSore?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded.</p><p>I rubbed the back of his neck, pressing my fingers deeper into the muscle tissue, feeling for knots. Tracing his hairline with my fingertips, massaging his scalp, rubbing my fingers along the tips of his ears, which I\u2019d heard was an acupressure point for dogs. He turned his head to rub his cheek against my knuckles. I scooted a little closer, rubbing those knuckles along the line of his cheekbone. He turned his head slightly, pulling one of my fingertips into his mouth. He nipped at it with his blunter front teeth before wrapping his tongue around it, running his tongue along the ridges of my fingerprints. A hot flash ran from my chest to my belly and settled between my thighs. Old, lovely, familiar sensations\u2014lust, excitement, giddy teenage zeal\u2014had me squirming in my seat. My eyes widened at the strength and dexterity of his tongue as he moved it over my skin. If he could do that to a fingertip, what could he do to my\u2014</p><p>I was jolted out of this rather indecent speculation by Caleb\u2019s suddenly veering off the road and throwing the truck into park. My seatbelt seemed to melt away, and Caleb was climbing across the seat.</p><p>His mouth. My God, his mouth was hot and so very wet against mine. He wrapped my legs around his waist, pressing me back against the seat and grinding his thick, solid, denim-covered erection against me.</p><p>I moaned into his mouth, threading my fingers through his hair with one hand and clinging to his neck with the other. His hands spanned the width of my waist, sliding down the front of my jeans and yanking them open. The dark depth of his eyes melted away and gave way to predatory gold. Pressing his mouth to my palm, he untangled my arms from his neck and had me lie back as he pulled my jeans and panties down. His warm, thick fingers slid smoothly inside me. He moved in and out, teasing me with an achingly slow rhythm as his thumb rubbed at my sensitive folds.</p><p>He grinned when I made a desperate whimper and crooked his fingers\u2014</p><p>I bolted up in my truck seat, disoriented and dizzy as I watched the scenery speed by. Caleb was driving, of course, and watching me with a little smirk on his face.</p><p>\u201cHey there, Rabbit,\u201d he said, jostling my shoulder gently. \u201cYou having another nightmare? You were moaning in your sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I mumbled, shifting in my seat to alleviate the full, tingling sensation of my damp jeans pressing against me.</p><p>Why was he smirking at me? Had I said anything in my sleep? I\u2019d never been much of a sleep-talker. I squirmed in my seat, trying subtly to move my uncomfortably wet panties\u2014</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>With a cringe, I realized that he could probably smell that I was definitely not having a bad dream. He was teasing me. Stupid werewolf supersenses.</p><p>My face went warm, and I nudged his hand away. I grabbed a bottle of water from my cupholder and took a very long, very cold drink.</p><p>We\u2019d been driving for three days and had already managed to collect on two relatively minor cases: a guy who passed bad checks in Healy and a woman who was a serial identity thief. I was amazed at how much Caleb managed to accomplish, tracking down about a dozen cases in the few weeks I traveled with him. He worked multiple cases at once, trying to track down several geographically convenient ne\u2019er-do-wells, whether they were wanted by the authorities or . . . other people with less actual authority but more money.</p><p>Occasionally, it was as easy as calling the target\u2019s mom and telling her to drag her son to the nearest sheriff\u2019s office, where Caleb was waiting. (It actually worked twice.) Others put up more of a fight, which was why\u2014given the Jerry debacle\u2014Caleb tried to keep me as far from actual clients as possible.</p><p>At least, he did until Suds called him about the Mort Johanssen case sometime in our second week together. According to the e-mail, Mort Johanssen was a match to his twin brother, a seafood magnate who needed a kidney. Merl Johanssen was getting increasingly desperate and offered Caleb an obscene amount of money to track down his wayward brother, a Delta Junction resident who hadn\u2019t spoken to his twin in years because of a dispute over their mother\u2019s will.</p><p>We sat at a sticky diner table, munching on waffles. Caleb handed me the paperwork Suds had passed on from an investigator in Kodiak. \u201cMerl\u2019s got a huge fleet of crab boats and owns shares in most of the fleets in Alaska. If you\u2019ve had crabs, it\u2019s more than likely Merl\u2019s had his hand in it.\u201d He pulled an uncomfortable face. \u201cThat sounded better in my head.\u201d</p><p>I snorted into my orange juice. \u201cI sure hope so.\u201d</p><p>I read over the medical report and saw that Merl\u2019s renal failure was attributed to damage from a bad reaction to an antibiotic called streptomycin. Generally, when a patient had kidney problems, treating the cause could alleviate the symptoms. But it was difficult to restore damaged tissue. Merl wasn\u2019t responding to treatment, and his creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rates were getting progressively worse.</p><p>I looked up to see that Caleb was watching me read the doctor\u2019s notes. I smiled and flipped over to the mug shot of Mort, a stubby, round-cheeked man with thinning red hair. He looked like a hungover Cupid. \u201cDo they both look like this?\u201d</p><p>Caleb nodded. \u201cIdentical. Mort took a test showing him to be a match just before their mom died. Merl was executor of her will and took some family hunting property that Mort thought should go to him. Angry words were exchanged. Mort declared he was keeping his blankety-blank kidney and stopped taking Merl\u2019s calls. But Merl\u2019s condition is getting worse, and he would like someone to find Mort and persuade him to come back. See, it\u2019s almost humanitarian. We\u2019re helping to save a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, so we\u2019re tracking someone down so he can have a kidney removed by force? Why don\u2019t we just get a Coleman cooler and yank the sucker out ourselves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been that good with anatomy.\u201d When Caleb saw my distressed expression, he added, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty-fifty,\u201d he admitted, waggling his hand. \u201cLook, all we have to do is walk in there, talk him into the car, and drive him to the airfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere twenty-four hours from now, he\u2019ll wake up in a tub full of ice with a mysterious pain in his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Caleb said, indignant. \u201cHe\u2019ll be flown to Portland for the procedure. As long as he\u2019s in reasonably good health, he\u2019ll be in and out in no time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I\u2019ve been a little wishy-washy in voicing my disapproval for your job in the past couple of weeks, but let me spell it out for you. We can\u2019t do this. We cannot use another human being for spare parts,\u201d I told him, lowering my voice when I realized the waitress was staring at me. \u201cIt\u2019s ghoulish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think Merl should have a shot at living?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI just think Mort should be able to make the decision for himself.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rabbit,\u201d he said, jostling my shoulder. I glowered at him. \u201cIf it makes you feel any better, Merl promised that if Mort donates his kidney, he\u2019ll pay about twenty thousand dollars in back child support to Mort\u2019s ex. See? It\u2019s a win-win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think it\u2019s pretty messed-up,\u201d I grumbled, sneaking a piece of bacon from his plate. The fact that he let me get away with it was a testament to his either liking me or feeling guilty for being a kidney snatcher.</p><p>Mort proved to be a wilier target than we anticipated. It took more than a week to track him from his snowmobile dealership in Delta Junction. Caleb grew more and more focused. He would disappear from our motel room for the night, coming back smelling of the woods. He wandered the town, searching for any hint of Mort\u2019s scent. No one in town would give up information about Mort, either out of solidarity or because they honestly didn\u2019t know. His live-in girlfriend, Monica, told me in no uncertain terms to kiss her ass and then slammed the door in my face. None of his employees would say anything besides telling us Mort was ice-fishing \u201csomewhere.\u201d Frankly, I was cheering Mort\u2019s wily ass on. As far as I was concerned, I\u2019d be happy if we never tracked the ginger escape artist down.</p><p>Caleb decided to move on to the nearest lake to scout ice-fishing camps, getting as far as a gas station ten miles outside of Delta Junction. The moment we stopped in the gas-station parking lot, his whole posture changed. His neck craned forward, and his nostrils flared. He jammed the truck into park, throwing me against the seatbelt. Caleb threw his arm across me in the classic \u201cmom brake\u201d maneuver, which I thought was gentlemanly until I looked down to where his hand was clasping my left breast. I cleared my throat. He glanced down, and his eyes went wide.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d I asked as he moved his hand.</p><p>\u201cThought I saw something,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThe opportunity to cop a feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would say I was sorry, but it would be a lie,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOK, well, while you search the parking lot for \u2018something,\u2019 I\u2019m going to go get some more jerky. We\u2019re down to one bag, and I know that makes you nervous.\u201d</p><p>I hopped out of the truck and walked into the station. It was a mom-and-pop operation in a two-story building called Mo-Mo\u2019s Gas-n-Go. Given the porch structure on the second story, I guessed that the owner lived in the apartment over the store.</p><p>After visiting one of the cleaner\u2014if overly bright\u2014gas-station stalls in the Greater Northwest, I visited the jerky display to determine whether I could sneak a similarly packaged, low-sodium version under Caleb\u2019s radar. I picked over the cellophane-wrapped tubes of meat, wrinkling my nose at the very idea of jalape\u00f1o-nacho-cheese beef jerky.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t even think about it,\u201d an amused voice sounded behind me. \u201cIf they have to spend that much time doctoring it up to make you want to eat it, you should just stick with corn chips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for me, trust me.\u201d I turned to share a chuckle with my helpful jerky Samaritan . . . and came face-to-face with the elusive Mort Johanssen. Jowly, bedraggled Mort Johanssen, in a green hunter\u2019s jacket, was offering me a friendly smile and advice on meat snacks.</p><p>\u201cOh, nooo,\u201d I groaned, dropping my jerky to the gas-station floor. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Mort frowned. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not very nice.\u201d</p><p>I pushed him none too gently away from the front window toward the little alcove where the restrooms were, so Caleb couldn\u2019t see him. There was a fire exit beyond the restrooms, half-hidden behind giant stacks of milk crates. Unfortunately, Mort was a little too much man for me to move all the way into the alcove, and we stopped just in front of the potato chip display. \u201cYou have to get out of here, preferably out that fire exit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWh-who the hell are you, lady?\u201d he spluttered, batting my hands away.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know this is going to sound weird and suspicious. But I happen to be traveling with someone who was sent by your brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>Mort actually shoved me away from him, paling even more under his decidedly wintry skin tone. \u201cMerl\u2019s still after my damn kidney?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cIt would seem so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re with that big guy who\u2019s been sniffing around town for me?\u201d</p><p>I blanched at the use of the word sniffing. But I continued, using my firm bedside-manner voice. \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you your business, but your brother is sick. Really sick. I understand that can make people desperate, but I still don\u2019t think that\u2019s an excuse to shanghai somebody into nonconsensual surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d Mort huffed.</p><p>I snagged a Sharpie out of my jacket pocket and grabbed the first item I saw from the shelves, which happened to be a bag of peanut butter Combos. I scribbled the name of the airfield where Merl had kept a private jet waiting for the last week, just in case we tracked Mort down. \u201cThere is a plane waiting for you here. They can be ready to take off within an hour if you show up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to buy those,\u201d he told me, nodding toward the Combos.</p><p>\u201cI will, I will.\u201d I shook my head at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I own the station, and every little bit counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, I will throw in the jerky and one of those little car air-freshener trees if you will pay attention to what I\u2019m saying.\u201d I put the bag in his hand and placed my palms on either side of his face so I knew he was looking me right in the eye. \u201cMerl needs your help. The chances of him lasting more than a few months without a transplant aren\u2019t good. You need to decide whether you can live with that or if you can find it in your heart to forgive your brother and give him what he needs to survive. Personally, I think you should be given the chance to make that decision on your own terms. So what I\u2019m telling you is that you need to haul ass out of that back door and run for it, so you have time to make that decision on your own terms before my friend sees you and makes this whole situation a lot more . . . intense. Now, do you have your car keys on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really sick?\u201d Mort asked.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s got very little time left.\u201d</p> <p>Mort\u2019s watery blue eyes narrowed at me. \u201cIs this a trick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m trying to trick you into escaping,\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cI need some time to think this over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is what I\u2019m trying to give you!\u201d I threw my hands up. \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re not even having the same conversation.\u201d</p><p>Behind me, I heard the station\u2019s front door swing open. Mort\u2019s eyes went wide, and I turned to see Caleb walking in with an anxious expression. That expression shifted from anxious to shocked and then even more confused in just a few seconds.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d I grunted, shoving Mort toward the back door. Of course, Mort left his Combos bag behind, so I had to chase after him and throw the marked snack bag at his head while he ducked out the door. Caleb charged after him. Against all bounds of logic, I hooked my arm through his and dug my heels into the slick tile floor. This, of course, did not work, because he had about seventy pounds and a whole lot of werewolf strength on his side.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, you\u2019re strong,\u201d I groaned as he dragged me across the floor to the exit.</p> <p>Just then, I heard the roar of an engine. Caleb turned, taking me with him as we watched a beat-up Chevy four-by-four peel out of the station parking lot and onto the road.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Caleb exclaimed as I climbed off of him and settled on unsteady feet.</p><p>I winced. \u201cI let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d he cried, throwing his arms up and making me flinch, which pissed me off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you yell at me!\u201d I shouted, catching the attention of the irritable clerk behind the counter.</p><p>\u201cYou need to clear out if you\u2019re going to carry on like that,\u201d she said, pointing at the door.</p><p>And now I was getting kicked out of a gas station. Classy.</p><p>Caleb caught my arm and pulled me out the front door. He wasn\u2019t hurting me, but the trapped, panicked feeling the sensation evoked had me clawing at his hands. He caught sight of my face and dropped his hands from my arms. But the momentum had me skidding toward the truck, bumping into the side panel with an ooof.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spent the better part of a week looking for this guy, and you helped him escape? What the hell is wrong with you? Have I not explained to you how my job works?\u201d Caleb was towering over me, his face livid.</p><p>\u201cI wanted him to make the decision for himself!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cIf nothing else, it helps us avoid pesky kidnapping charges. I gave him all of the information for the airfield. He has time to think about it, and I truly, truly believe that he\u2019s going to do the right thing and show up for that flight. Everybody wins. His brother gets a kidney. Mort\u2019s kids get the back child support. And maybe, Mort and Merl can be closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get to make those decisions!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to just decide which cases are OK to pursue and which ones aren\u2019t. You don\u2019t get to interfere with how I make my living, which is how I support the both of us, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have an issue with how you make your living. And I never asked you to support me. You just scooped me up and put me in your pocket. You didn\u2019t ask me what I wanted. You just insisted that you knew what was best for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re incapable of using common sense! You just throw yourself into these stupid situations because you refuse to listen to anybody else!\u201d Caleb shouted. I could feel cold fear winding through my belly, crawling up my spine. My jaw clenched tight. It was better that way, to keep myself from saying something stupid, from making it worse. \u201cSomebody has to look out for you.\u201d</p><p>I held my hands up defensively, my back pressed against the truck as Caleb yelled.</p><p>\u201cAnd all the while, you sneak around behind my back, doing God knows what, because you decided that you know better. Who do you think you are?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, my face practically buried in my own shoulder. I was folding in on myself, trying to make myself smaller. I could feel all of those old instincts creeping back.</p><p>And that pissed me off.</p><p>And for once, instead of flinching away, I lunged. \u201cWhat makes you think you can talk to me like that?\u201d I shouted, advancing and shoving my finger into his face. The loud, raging voice coming out of me didn\u2019t even sound like my own. Caleb seemed just as shocked, considering the way he backed up. \u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me like I\u2019m some stupid child. You don\u2019t stand over me and scream at me until I agree with you. Just who the hell do you think you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m someone who cares about you,\u201d Caleb said, his voice considerably calmer.</p><p>\u201cSo that gives you the right to make any sort of decision for me? Do you think this is what I wanted? Do you think I would have spent one minute with you if I knew how \u2018protective\u2019 you would be?\u201d</p><p>Hurt and guilt flashed simultaneously across his features as his body relaxed from its confrontational stance. \u201cOK, OK. You\u2019re right,\u201d he conceded. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have raised my voice. Or dragged you around like that. That was wrong.\u201d</p><p>But I was long past hearing what he had to say. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d I yelled, advancing on Caleb until he backed into another truck with a thunk. \u201cHow dare you tell me what to do, where to go, what to wear, who to talk to?\u201d</p><p>Caleb frowned and shook his head. \u201cI never said anything about what you\u2019re wearing. I just gave you a bag of clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a person, damn it. I\u2019m an adult! I was smart enough to get through school. Why wasn\u2019t I smart enough to see you for what you are? Why couldn\u2019t I see the stupid excuses I was making for you? Why?\u201d</p><p>Caleb stood there, dumbfounded, as I ranted at him and cried. I got angry enough to swing at him, something that would shame me later. He ducked the blow easily and caught my arms to prevent a second round. So I kicked him in the shins, which he clearly didn\u2019t expect. The sight of him yelping and grabbing at his leg was enough to snap me out of my conniption fit.</p><p>My arms dropped to my sides as Caleb stared at me in horror. We were lucky the clerk hadn\u2019t called the cops on us.</p><p>I\u2019d hurt him\u2014not much, but the expression on his face was enough to make my stomach roll all over again. I dashed behind the truck and tossed my lunch all over the gravel of the parking lot. And I felt like a first-prize idiot.</p><p>Yes, Caleb was occasionally annoying and consistently overprotective, but he\u2019d never done anything remotely hurtful to me. He\u2019d never called me names, never made me feel inadequate or small. Heck, if the bruises currently healing on his shins were any indication, I\u2019d done more physical damage to him than he\u2019d done to me. Over and over, Caleb had shown me that he was not Glenn. He deserved a lot of things, but being my emotional punching bag by proxy was not one of them.</p><p>I rinsed my mouth with the water Caleb pressed into my hand. He helped me climb into the truck, and I tucked my arms around my folded legs. I glanced through the front window of the station and saw the clerk watching us warily. Caleb pulled out of the parking lot and drove silently back to the motel. He didn\u2019t talk during the drive or while we walked into the motel or even while I stripped down and showered, trying to fight off the chills with lukewarm water.</p><p>I shuffled out of the bathroom, wearing Caleb\u2019s T-shirt and a pair of sweats, and sat on the bed next to Caleb. He had his hands folded in his lap, staring straight ahead with a completely blank expression. There was a long, awkward silence, in which I speculated that he would finally decide I was too much trouble to deal with and send me on my way. And part of me thought maybe it would be better that way. Maybe it would hurt less in the long run.</p><p>Maybe I should take the choice away from him. Maybe I should get up and just start packing. I\u2019d spent too much time procrastinating. I needed to stop this madness and get to Anchorage, start over, and Caleb . . . Caleb was still staring straight ahead, which was starting to worry me.</p><p>\u201cSo back at the station, you weren\u2019t really talking to me, huh?\u201d he finally asked.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cYou were talking to him? The guy who gives you nightmares?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, not able to look up at him. \u201cI never got around to counseling. I read all of the right self-help books, worked through them as instructed. I was offered anonymous talk therapy over the phone with a specialized counselor, but I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. Somehow, admitting what happened to me, making it real, seemed to make all of the progress I\u2019d made unreal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have some stuff in your past that you don\u2019t want to tell me about. And I\u2019ve tried not to pry. But eventually, Rabbit, you\u2019re going to have to talk to me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want a blow-by-blow account?\u201d I asked. \u201cDo you want to look at my journal? There\u2019s an entertaining read, or at least it was before I realized he was reading it. Giving me even that tiny bit of privacy was just too much for him. Do you want me to tell you I was some sweet, naive girl who never suspected a thing? Because I did suspect\u2014a lot\u2014but I just couldn\u2019t figure a way out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not asking you to share anything with me you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he insisted. \u201cFor now, you should know that I\u2019m not whoever you were yelling at. I wouldn\u2019t ever lay a hand on you in anger. I may bluster and fuss, but I wouldn\u2019t try to take your choices away. I kind of like that you\u2019re always trying to get around me to do what you want. It\u2019s what makes you interesting and frustrating and, well, you. I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, resenting him for being so damned understanding. I didn\u2019t know how to respond to this. I knew what to do when someone was yelling or threatening. I didn\u2019t know what to do in the face of respectful boundaries. God, that was sad.</p><p>I slipped an arm around him. He tucked my head under his chin and kissed my hair. \u201cAlso, you have to stop kicking me in the shin. It\u2019s emasculating.\u201d</p><p>A snort rippled up from my lungs, and I covered it with a cough. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s no excuse for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He ruffled my hair, his hand lingering on top of my head. I leaned into it, tucking my face against his chest. He wrapped the other arm around me and secured me there.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I raised my voice,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have known better. You showed all those skittish signs. I knew you wouldn\u2019t tolerate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m a walking advertisement for post-traumatic stress. Awesome,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, the signs are pretty subtle, but I watch you closely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me feel any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cCan we just go to bed and pretend you\u2019re not still crazy angry with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not \u2018crazy\u2019 angry with you. I\u2019m \u2018sane person\u2019 angry with you. And we\u2019re going to have to talk about your bleeding-heart tendencies at some point,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sighed, flopping down on the threadbare pillows. \u201cBut not tonight.\u201d</p><p>He scooted up on the bed, under the blankets, and curled his body around mine. He rested his chin on my shoulder and draped an arm around my middle. I closed my eyes and sighed as the heat from his skin seeped into mine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy name\u2019s not Anna.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a squeeze. \u201cI figured that out a while ago.\u201d</p><p>There was another long, silent pause. He wasn\u2019t going to ask me. He was waiting for me to tell him myself, to make the choice to share that part of me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tina,\u201d I told him. \u201cChristina, if you want to be technical about it. But I was named after my mother, and we couldn\u2019t have two Christinas in the house. And I refused to be called Chrissie. Since then, I\u2019ve been called Anna, Melissa, Brandy, Lisa, and Tess. I was Anna the longest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re not calling me Rabbit, you mean?\u201d</p><p>He laughed into my skin, a canine whickering noise that was more wolf than man.</p><p>\u201cTina.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI would really like to be Tina again.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed the nape of my neck, sending a pleasant warm tingle down my spine. \u201cI like Tina, too.\u201d</p><p>I woke up to the sound of Caleb whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me!\u201d</p><p>I rolled over to see his bare back as he hunched over the edge of the bed. He was talking into his cell phone, muttering furiously under his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me,\u201d he said again.</p><p>I sat up in bed, swiping at my face. I padded toward the bathroom to brush my teeth as Caleb continued muttering into his phone. He wrapped up the phone call by sighing and saying, \u201cShe\u2019s going to be hell to live with after this.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow and spat out the excess toothpaste. He ended the connection and flopped back on the bed, pinching the bridge of his nose.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Caleb sat up, rolling his eyes. \u201cThat was Merl\u2019s office. Mort showed up at the airfield last night, just like you said he would. He checked in to the hospital this morning for presurgery testing. Merl is expressing his gratitude with a rather large check.\u201d</p><p>My lips wanted to twitch into a grin, but I tamped it down. \u201cGloating would be an ugly thing to do even when I was insanely right, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, it would,\u201d he said, giving me an exasperated look.</p><p>He hauled himself out of bed and helped me gather up our bags. We completed our various packing-up chores side-by-side, organizing the files, securing the equipment, checking under the bed and in the bathroom for forgotten items. Caleb was sulking, but it was a quiet kicking my own ass sort of self-flagellation to which I was not accustomed. He wasn\u2019t throwing things around the room, breaking my stuff, or sending me wounded-baby-deer looks because I was so very cruel. He just silently worked through the moving-out checklist with his mouth clenched shut. As we walked out of the motel room, I bumped him with my hip. His lips quirked, but he actively suppressed the smile. Walking toward the truck, I bumped him again. He laughed, throwing his arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWe did the right thing, Caleb. We let Mort make the choice for himself. I\u2019m sorry I went about it in a dishonest way, trying to sneak him out of the gas station. But it all worked out in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if it hadn\u2019t?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I smiled in what I hoped was a winsome, nonobnoxious manner. \u201cWell, then, I would owe you a rather large apology.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t agree with what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in all cases,\u201d I protested. \u201cBut I think that you should check into backgrounds and circumstances a little more before you agree to look for someone. There are people out there who deserve to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>It was probably the maximum amount of progress I was going to make, so I would take it and run. \u201cWho was right?\u201d I asked, preening just the tiniest bit.</p><p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d he said, standing up.</p><p>I fairly skipped to stand in front of him, bouncing on the balls of my feet. \u201cWho is smarter than you?\u201d</p><p>He crossed his arms over his chest and sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re smarter than me.\u201d</p><p>I kissed his chin, because that was as high as I could reach. \u201cDon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that last bit really necessary?\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cHey, I had a whole \u2018I Told You So\u2019 dance choreographed. You\u2019re lucky I\u2019m sparing you that,\u201d I told him. He harrumphed as he helped me climb up into the truck. \u201cIt was set to the tune of \u2018Single Ladies.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Caleb narrowed his eyes at me. \u201cYou are evil. Pure evil wrapped up in a tiny pixie package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was a correct evil pixie package,\u201d I said.</p><p>8</p><p>From Some Senders, All E-mails Are Red-Flagged</p><p>I celebrated the arrival of Merl\u2019s very large check by finding the world\u2019s only Laundromat-slash-Internet caf\u00e9 and checked my e-mail while our delicates spun dry. Caleb was meeting with someone about a case that was \u201ctoo preliminary\u201d to discuss with me. He\u2019d asked me to stick close to the motel, but I needed to check my private e-mail address, and we were running low on clean socks. I was more comfortable with using the caf\u00e9\u2019s computers to check the secure server I used for Red-burn\u2019s e-mails. I hoped that she\u2019d sent some update on my paperwork.</p><p>When I typed my information into the log-in fields, my in-box had sprouted new messages like acne on a One Direction fan. Thirty-eight new messages starting weeks before, right around the time I ran out of Emerson\u2019s and saved a werewolf. The subject lines were all the same: \u201cFOUND YOU, BITCH.\u201d</p><p>I knocked my foam coffee cup from the table, splashing scalding liquid across my thighs and barely noticing the burn. My stomach pitched, and the floor seemed to tilt underneath me. Hands shaking, I clicked on the first one. It was short and to the point: \u201cI found you, bitch. Did you really think you could run from me? Do you think living in the ass end of nowhere will keep me from finding you? Don\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m on my way. We\u2019ll be seeing each other real soon.\u201d</p><p>Glenn was smart enough not to sign it, and the e-mail address was listed as</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ . I knew he would be smart enough not to send the message from his home computer. If by some insane chance I went to the cops, they wouldn\u2019t be able to trace it back to his IP address.</p><p>Also, I found it a little distressing that there were so many people using gotchubitch as an e-mail user name that Glenn had to add numerals to it.</p><p>I highly doubted that this was some unfortunate cyber-coincidence, a misdirected message, or a prank. I was able to fight through the initial wave of panic, the cold flush that spread from my heart to my limbs, making it impossible to move my fingers the way I should. I knew this was coming, I reminded myself. Red-burn had warned me that he was getting closer. This e-mail campaign was most likely a bluff. He was probably thousands of miles away. Because if he\u2019d really found me, he would be here, right now, telling me what an ungrateful cow I was as he dragged me back to Tennessee.</p><p>I took a long, lung-stretching breath and forced it out through my nostrils, then clicked on the other messages. The next few e-mails were more conciliatory. He missed me. His life just didn\u2019t work without me. He didn\u2019t know why I\u2019d run away, but he would do anything he could to make our relationship work. Wouldn\u2019t I please contact him so he would stop worrying about me? The messages ran in cycles\u2014angry, demanding, pitiful, lonely, and then back to vicious and threatening.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t scare me, I told myself, hoping that eventually, I would believe it. I could fight him now. I could escape before he even realized we were in the same room. I wasn\u2019t the same naive, trusting girl he\u2019d married. He didn\u2019t even know me anymore. I wasn\u2019t that same person. And there was Caleb to consider.</p><p>Oh, God, what if he hurt Caleb? I knew it wasn\u2019t likely, what with the whole turns-into-a-giant-apex-predator issue. But even werewolves had to yield to bullets, and Glenn wasn\u2019t above bringing a gun to a werewolf fistfight.</p><p>Still in a bit of a daze, I gathered our clean clothes together, folded them on automatic pilot, and shuffled back to the motel. In an unexpected turn of fortune, I was able to walk a city block in a rural small town without being attacked or harassed by hooligan lumberjacks. I tried to appear as calm as possible as I walked back to the motel. It wouldn\u2019t do to let Caleb see me freaked out. He would ask all kinds of questions, and I would give him answers, because my verbal filters were shaky enough that I\u2019d tell him everything. And then . . . I didn\u2019t know what would happen then.</p><p>I stopped at the tiny general store and found turkey jerky and some coffee, because Caleb hated the brand that the motel kept on hand. I took several deep breaths outside of our motel-room door and pushed it open with a pleasant smile fixed on my face.</p><p>I found Caleb tossing our clothes into our bags. The laptop and the rest of the equipment were already packed and sitting by the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, dropping the grocery bags by my laptop.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going home,\u201d he said.</p><p>For a terrifying moment, I thought he meant the valley. How was I supposed to explain that? How was I going to casually drop, Oh, by the way, I know your family. And that you\u2019re a supernatural creature. Surprise!</p><p>\u201cH-home?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, home base. Suds\u2019s bar in Fairbanks, the Suds Bucket. I\u2019ve had a couple of urgent e-mails from him about a few cases, so I need to go check in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just call him?\u201d I asked, thinking about this new development. Fairbanks would bring me closer to Anchorage but not close enough. It was still a six-hour drive in good weather.</p><p>\u201cSuds is getting anxious about a couple of guys we\u2019re looking for, big payouts and no developments. So I need to go talk shop with him for a while. We\u2019ll leave at first light, stay there with him in a non-motel room, which will be awfully nice. It\u2019ll only take a few days, and then we\u2019ll be on the road to Anchorage, just like I promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I said, nodding, suddenly distracted by the neatly folded pile of fresh laundry. One of Glenn\u2019s biggest gripes about my housekeeping was my sloppy, haphazard laundry methods. Clean clothes had to be precisely folded or they would end up thrown in a big messy pile in the closet for me to fold all over again. So when I left, my first act of rebellion was to throw my socks into the drawer in a massive sock ball. But now my socks were matched and folded with military precision.</p><p>\u201cNo arguments, no negotiations, just \u2018OK\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I said, nodding again, chewing my lip. E-mails. All it took was a few pissy e-mails from my ex-husband, and I had retreated right back into \u201clife with Glenn\u201d coping mechanisms. What did that say about my progress so far? What did it say about my ability to survive on my own?</p><p>I could send Caleb after Glenn.</p><p>The thought took root as quickly and stealthily as a poisonous weed. I had a big bad werewolf on my side. He could make my Glenn problem disappear with a snap of his claws. No more running. No more hiding. No more fear. All I had to do was ask. It was on the tip of my tongue.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Caleb squeezed my arm gently. My eyes snapped up to his face and its expression of concern. \u201cAre you all right?</p><p>I gave him a weak smile. I couldn\u2019t ask that of him. I couldn\u2019t ask Caleb to kill for me. I wouldn\u2019t put blood on his hands, or mine. I would have to handle this myself.</p><p>\u201cYou spaced out a little bit on me,\u201d Caleb said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, just not looking forward to another couple of hours in the truck. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, plopping down on the bed and pulling me into his lap. \u201cWell, that\u2019s because I haven\u2019t introduced you to the wonders of my Conway Twitty CD collection.\u201d</p><p>What little smile I was able to produce disappeared, even as he nuzzled my neck. \u201cIf there is any good in this world, you are kidding.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, while Caleb slept, I sat up, thinking over the e-mail issue. How had Glenn found my e-mail address? Before I\u2019d stumbled out of the Internet caf\u00e9, I\u2019d checked the log-in history and didn\u2019t see any suspicious account activity. Had he figured out the password? How much longer would it be before he tried to take over the account?</p><p>In those few moments before my brain had completely melted down, I\u2019d deleted every e-mail Red-burn had ever sent me and then sent her a quick message telling her it was possible the account had been compromised and asking if she could call my phone. I\u2019d changed the e-mail password and increased the security settings, arranging it so that any changes would be tracked through my cell phone.</p><p>Glenn thought he could find me. He had no idea how good I\u2019d gotten at hiding.</p><p>With a decisiveness that seemed cold and alien, I swung my feet out from under the covers. I scrawled a short note to Caleb on one of his Post-its and stuck it to the lampshade. I concentrated on keeping my feet silent on the nubby motel carpet. My bags were already packed for the early-morning departure. All I had to do was slip on some jeans and shoes and somehow manage to open the door without waking up Caleb, who had superhearing. No problem.</p><p>Dressing quietly, I watched him as he slept, the weak light filtering through the curtains giving his skin a faint yellow glow. Just like the light that would spread over his skin before the change. I was more than a little disappointed that I would never get to see Caleb shift. I would have liked to see what he looked like in wolf form. Of course, his human form wasn\u2019t too bad, either.</p><p>My fingers fumbled with the button of my jeans, and I shook them out. What was I doing? Why couldn\u2019t I just wake him and tell him that I was freaking out and needed his help? Why couldn\u2019t I give up my need to run as soon as things got tough? Why couldn\u2019t I just tell him I knew about wolfiness? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caleb let out a whuffling sound and turned onto his side, burying his face in his pillow.</p><p>The distinctly canine movement made my lips curve into a fond smile. I couldn\u2019t do that to Caleb. I couldn\u2019t drag him down with me, into my big bag of crazy. He belonged to the valley, with his pack, not running my ex-husband down like the proverbial dog. He deserved to go back home and find some nice wolf-girl and have furry little babies. He deserved someone who could share her whole life with him, not just carefully edited sound bites.</p><p>Just walk out, my brain commanded. Put on your coat and get the hell out before you manage to talk yourself out of this. Move your feet.</p><p>So that\u2019s what I did. I slung my bag over my shoulder and made it all the way to the door. I looked back.</p> <p>Damn it, why did I look back?</p><p>Caleb\u2019s hair was all mussed around his face, his relaxed, nearly boyish face. His lips were parted as he breathed deeply. I was going to miss that. I wanted nothing more than to crawl back into bed, where it was warm and safe and smelled like him.</p><p>I moved closer to the bed, even as my brain lectured me about mocking the laws of common sense. I stretched out my arm, stopping just short of running my fingers along his cheek.</p><p>\u201cBe happy.\u201d I pressed the barest whisper of a kiss against his cheek, inhaling his spicy, woodsy scent one last time, and ran out of the motel room as if he was hot on my heels.</p><p>9</p> <p>I Make Use of Stolen Law-Enforcement Equipment</p><p>I, for lack of a more flowery term, hauled ass up the street to a bar called Slippery Sam\u2019s. It had been a while since I\u2019d done any kind of running, and I ended up pulling a hamstring. But it was worth it to be able to close myself up in the dark, smoky room and hide in a booth lit only by a neon blue St. Pauli Girl sign.</p><p>The waitress wasn\u2019t thrilled to have a nonordering freeloader taking up her booth. So when I mentioned I was looking for a ride, she was quick to point out the bar\u2019s beer distributor, Bart, who would be departing for parts unknown within the next thirty minutes. Parts unknown sounded pretty good to me. And the rotund, grandfatherly driver\u2019s rig was parked out back, which was even better.</p><p>Bart was willing to take me as far as a saloon about four hours away, where he happened to know of a Coca-Cola distributor who ran a regular route to Rooklin, about a hundred miles east. He vouched for Carl, the Coca-Cola man, as a noncrazy non\u2013serial killer and promised to arrange for my transportation to Rooklin, for which I was very grateful. Even when he insisted on showing me a few dozen pictures of his kids, grandkids, and various salmon he\u2019d caught in the past year.</p><p>Bart dutifully handed me off to Carl, who turned out to be a skinny, pimply twenty-one-year-old who couldn\u2019t see over the steering wheel without the aid of a phone book. But he was very sweet and offered me some insights into Battlestar Galactica that I\u2019d never considered. Despite his willingness to share his thermos of coffee, I was pretty much dead on my feet by the time we rolled into my latest destination.</p><p>Rooklin was like so many of the small Alaskan towns I\u2019d traveled through, a tiny oasis of civilization carved out of a gap between mountains, surrounded by endless evergreen trees. Main Street consisted of a dozen wooden storefronts crammed close together, as much to save on construction materials as on the cost of heating during those long winters. There were no chain stores or fast-food restaurants, just locally owned essential businesses: a grocer\u2019s, a bar, a medical clinic, and a combination pawn shop and office-supply store called Dudley\u2019s Duplicates.</p> <p>Carl sent me off with a plastic bag full of Oreos and a bold pat on the arm, wishing me luck as I wandered down Rooklin\u2019s main street to Dudley\u2019s Duplicates. It was downright painful to sell the little emerald ring my late grandmother had given me for my sweet sixteen. I\u2019d managed to hold on to it all this time, only to sell it for a whopping eighty-five dollars to a pawn broker. But in a choice between sentiment and a roof over my head, I figured Gramma would understand. She\u2019d been a practical woman.</p><p>I supposed this was my official rock bottom.</p><p>I had just enough money to rent a room at Rooklin Right-Price Rooms for two nights and buy a loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter from the market. If I was really lucky, Red-burn might be able to arrange a ride to Anchorage for me before I ran through my meager cash stash. If not, I was going to have to make a choice between buying supplies and keeping all of my minor organs. Maybe I could contact Merl about getting a good price.</p><p>Tucked as safe as I could be in the luxurious accommodations at the Right-Price, I sat at the foot of the lumpy bed and stared at the beige-yellow walls. In danger of slipping into crippling despair, I needed to find the bright side. I was alive. I was\u2014for the most part\u2014unharmed. For the moment, life was pretty good. If I could get some sleep, I could face the next day.</p><p>I spent two days burning through time slots at Dudley\u2019s Duplicates\u2019 Internet \u201ccaf\u00e9,\u201d also known as two wobbly folding chairs and a card table in the corner of the store. I contacted Red-burn through a newly established qwickmail address, using our safe word, caduceus, to verify that it was me, not Glenn posing as me. I updated her on my situation and asked for any details on my new identity, which she couldn\u2019t provide yet. She did, however, wire me a few hundred dollars so my minor organs could remain unpawned. And because it was a better nervous habit than smoking or knuckle cracking, I reread the restraining-order laws in Alaska. While the state troopers would be willing to assist authorities close to Glenn, I still had no idea where he was. He was smart enough to cover his tracks through a fake IP address, so that wouldn\u2019t be any help. I didn\u2019t know if he was really getting closer to me or if he was just playing a mind game. I wasn\u2019t willing to take the risk, either way.</p><p>While I had much better evidence of Glenn\u2019s harassment this time, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get any sort of legal revenge on him. And my unwillingness to dirty the pack\u2019s collective paws cut me off from my avenues to bloody, though clearly justified, illegal revenge. My best hope now was simple escape, even if that meant long-term residence at Rooklin Right-Price Rooms.</p><p>Please, good and merciful God, don\u2019t let it mean long-term residence at Rooklin Right-Price Rooms.</p><p>Constructed in one of those old-fashioned \u201copen courtyard plans,\u201d the motel had seen considerably better days. Of course, so had I. I just wanted to get out of the cold and get some sleep. I had trouble sleeping here, and it didn\u2019t have anything to do with the cracker-thin mattress or the scratchy sheets. I\u2019d had nightmares about Glenn every night since I\u2019d arrived in Rooklin. The nightmare was always the same: Glenn breaking down my door and dragging me out of bed by the hair, screaming about taking me home where I belonged. But the beds changed in every dream. One night, it was in my bedroom in my cozy little house in the valley; the next, it was my motel room in McClusky; and the next, it was the first room I shared with Caleb.</p> <p>The guilt, the worry, and the lack of sleep had combined into a strange buzzing sensation that settled between my eyes like a half-formed headache. It had been a mistake, leaving Caleb the way I did. It was cowardly, and Caleb deserved more than that. He deserved more than a stupid Post-it note on a lampshade. And what really sucked was that I would never be able to apologize for it, because I would never see him again. I wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d want me to.</p><p>I missed Caleb. I missed his warmth and weight on the other side of the mattress. I missed the weird wolfy whuffling sounds he made in his sleep. I missed his terrible taste in road music and the faint smell of strange jerky in his truck. I missed feeling safe.</p><p>I scrubbed my hands over my face. It wasn\u2019t like me to be so distracted, wandering around outside like this, but I was just so damn tired. I shuffled down the cracked cement patio in front of the motel-room doors, toying with the plastic key fob as I made my way to my room. There were only twelve of them, and I had rented unit eleven, at the far end of the complex.</p><p>Across the lot, two Carhartt-clad men stood hunched over an open truck hood, poking at the engine with tools while they slugged back beer. I gave it no thought when they looked up. I smiled wearily at them.</p><p>Both men straightened, two predators scenting the wind for prey. Both smiles stretched just a bit wider in an insincere parody of friendly politeness. But I\u2019d lived with apex predators for four years. I knew that look, the overeager, hungry excitement just before the killing lunge. I had just a few seconds before\u2014</p><p>\u201cHey there,\u201d the younger of the two said with a wink. He was tall and broad, with a flat nose and muddy brown eyes.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>His voice, with its cruel, teasing tone, had my stomach dropping, a cold, dead weight in the pit of my belly. Without thinking, I closed in on myself. I sank into survival mode, eyes to the ground, face set, ears attuned. I didn\u2019t respond, didn\u2019t acknowledge that I\u2019d heard one of them speak. I prayed that I was wrong, that these were just a couple of guys passing their time in the parking lot, content with some harmless flirtation with a pretty girl. An available girl, at least.</p><p>Could I dash back to the motel office and stall long enough that they wouldn\u2019t see which room I was in? Why did I smile? What was I thinking? I\u2019d gotten soft, living with the pack, believing I was safe. I\u2019d gotten cocky. I\u2019d barely had any problems since moving up here. And the minute stupidity and exhaustion made me drop my guard, I landed in a big pile of slimeball.</p><p>I wished Caleb was there. It was as if my brain blurted out his name. Caleb said he would keep me safe, and suddenly, I felt like an idiot for taking that for granted. Disturbing law-enforcement-grade equipment collection or no, I felt a lot more comfortable with the way he smiled at me than with these two.</p><p>Wait, law-enforcement equipment.</p><p>I shoved my hand into my coat and slipped my fingers around the collapsible metal baton. If the parking-lot predators could see the wicked way my lips curved as my hand wound around my trusty weapon, they would have been very afraid. They certainly wouldn\u2019t have been circling closer, making nasty comments to each other that they thought I couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have a burly werewolf to watch over me. I had this big metal stick. And Caleb wasn\u2019t my husband or my big, strong protector. He wasn\u2019t even my boyfriend. He was a guy who had picked me up like a stray and tucked me into his pocket. And none of this changed the fact that these guys were now standing between me and my room and the office, one on each side. So friendly parking-lot loiterers was out, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cHey, slow down, now, slow down, we just want to talk to you,\u201d the younger one said as they moved behind me, toward my door. The elder had a bulky, athlete-gone-soft build and thick salt-and-pepper hair, while his counterpart was tall with wicked-looking tattoos crawling up his neck.</p><p>Without replying, I just kept moving. My hands were shaking so hard I was afraid I was going to drop my key. And it wasn\u2019t exactly intimidating to see a woman quaking so badly it looked as if she was conducting an orchestra instead of waving a weapon in your face.</p><p>Hold it together, I told myself. Steady hands.</p><p>\u201cHere, let us help you with that,\u201d the older one offered solicitously, holding out his oil-stained hands as I struggled to fit my key into the lock. Was it a bad idea to open my door? Would they push me into the room and close the door before I could scream? Maybe I would be better off dodging my way to the office. I shoved the key back into my pocket and backed away</p><p>I kept my tone coolly polite. \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t be like that,\u201d the older one chided through his yellowed, crooked teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t be rude, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re not being very friendly,\u201d the younger one agreed, as if I owed him my time or attention, just because he decided he wanted a conversation.</p><p>I hated these guys. I hated these \u201cnice guys\u201d who just waited for some woman to reject their attentions, so they could act the wounded party and avenge their injured pride with slurs and swipes. I\u2019d met far too many of them in my travels, and they never ceased to piss me off.</p><p>The younger one\u2014Grabby Hands\u2014tried to yank at my elbow, but I ducked out of the way and put my back to the wall.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble. Leave me alone.\u201d Shaky, too shaky. Damn it. Why couldn\u2019t I get my voice to work right? The very air around me seemed to be closing in on me, the edges of my vision darkening and blurring as the men moved closer.</p><p>\u201cWant a beer, sweetheart?\u201d Yellow Teeth asked. \u201cWe got plenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. Have a nice night,\u201d I said as I gripped the handle of the baton and backed away from them.</p><p>Grabby Hands frowned. \u201cHey, where do you think you\u2019re going? We\u2019re not done talking to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d The good news was that righteous indignation gave my voice some weight, even as Grabby Hands reached up to drag his hand along my arm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d I said, growling now.</p><p>Grabby Hands lived up to the name I\u2019d mentally tagged him with, poking at my side, as if he was going to tickle me. I dodged again, hissing at him like an angry cat. Yellow Teeth was no longer amused. He clamped his hand around my wrist, dragging me close enough to smell his rank, smoke-tainted breath. I whipped the baton out of my pocket with a loud zing.</p><p>Grabby Hands reacted faster and stumbled back a step. Yellow Teeth didn\u2019t seem impressed with my little metal stick . . . until I cracked his wrist with it, aiming right for the sensitive ulnar nerve. He yowled, snatching his hand away. I went after his knees as if he was a particularly icky pi\u00f1ata. Grabby Hands had his arm around me from behind, lifting me and trying to drag the baton out of my hand. Yanking my arm down, I crashed my head back into his face. He yelped, and I felt the warm spurt of blood from his nose oozing down my back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBitch! You broke my nose!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>I swung at him again, the baton make a high whipping noise as it crashed down on his thigh. I thought I heard the bone buckle as another hand closed around the wrist holding the baton. The hand jerked away suddenly, and I focused my attention on Grabby Hands, hunched in front of me. He leaned over, oblivious to me now as he tried to reset his nose. I slammed his head into the concrete-block wall, knocking him unconscious.</p><p>A hand wrapped around the back of my neck, the fingers digging viciously into my skin, making me yelp. Yellow Teeth shoved me against the wall, my head whacking against the rough wooden plank. The pain had my arms dropping limp and useless at my sides when Yellow Teeth pinned me to the wall with his hips. I barely kept hold of the baton as his belt buckle dug into my stomach. His stained, nasty smile glinted in the low sunlight. \u201cOh, sweetheart, you just made this more fun for us.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s when I heard a low growl behind us.</p><p>I knew that growl. I\u2019d heard more than enough of it during my time in the valley. That wasn\u2019t some stray dog or a cranky, city-dwelling bear. That was the growl of a pissed-off werewolf. And I\u2019d never been so happy to hear it in my entire life.</p><p>Yellow Teeth kept his hand at my throat as he turned. I\u2019d expected to see fur and four paws over my assailant\u2019s shoulder. But Caleb was in human form, eyes glowing an eerie gold, lips pulled back from teeth growing longer and sharper.</p><p>\u201cMind your own business,\u201d Yellow Teeth grunted as he threw his weight against my squirming body. \u201cJust walk away.\u201d</p><p>Caleb didn\u2019t like that, if his sharper growls were any indication. A strange, warm calm spread from my chest outward to my arms and legs. My fingers relaxed and held their grip on the baton. The pain in my head didn\u2019t matter anymore. Yellow Teeth\u2019s grip on my throat didn\u2019t matter. I was safe.</p> <p>And while I was ridiculously happy to see him, I knew that seeing him shift would be very bad. The last thing I needed to deal with was explaining to the state police why two guys I\u2019d beaten up in a parking lot seemed to think my traveling companion could morph into a giant wolf. That was the sort of thing that got attention.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, don\u2019t,\u201d I said in a firm, calm tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s wrong with his face?\u201d Yellow Teeth wheezed, his grip on my neck slackening.</p><p>\u201cCaleb, calm down,\u201d I told him, but Caleb was beyond listening.</p><p>A ripple of golden light spread from his chest. He was about to shift. In broad daylight. In front of humans. I was wrong before. This was the definition of screwed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this guy?\u201d Yellow Teeth\u2019s fingers slipped off of my neck, and he stared at Caleb.</p> <p>Caleb advanced, hunching over as his limbs stretched into inhuman shapes.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I told him, but Caleb seemed intent on ripping Yellow Teeth\u2019s throat out. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed Yellow Teeth\u2019s head, as if I was about to give him a big, wet kiss, only to yank hard as I turned and rammed it against the wall behind me with just enough force not to fracture his skull. He yelped and went limp. I dropped his leaden, unconscious body next to his equally knocked-out friend.</p><p>Caleb snarled and lunged toward them, body in half-phase. I could see the bones shifting under his skin, cheekbones bulging and exaggerated as they moved into their canine shape. His teeth stretched and sharpened into fangs to match the claws growing from his fingertips. And for some stupid reason I could not explain, I stepped between the insta-wolf and my attacker, hooking my arms under Caleb\u2019s and throwing my weight against his chest. I could feel fur brushing against my face and had this bizarre urge to bury my face in it.</p><p>But that would be insane, right? Right?</p><p>Right. Defuse public werewolf transformation now. Evaluate need for heavy doses of antipsychotic meds later.</p><p>The fur disappeared and gave way to warm, human(ish) skin. Strong arms swung around my middle with the force of stalled forward momentum. I glanced up to see Caleb\u2019s human features twisted into an expression of vicious rage. His eyes darkened from that predatory yellow back to their smooth bitter-coffee color.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but gape up at him, even as he manhandled me. It wasn\u2019t just that he was quite the sight to behold. He\u2019d changed back mid-phase. I didn\u2019t know that was possible, especially when the werewolf in question was this pissed off. Maggie was one of the most in-control wolves I\u2019d ever met, and it could take her an hour to come back to herself when she was angry.</p> <p>Caleb\u2019s arm curled around my waist, pressing me to his side as he struggled toward Grabby Hands and Yellow Teeth. I wedged my foot in front of his, pushing him back with all of my might, but it was like trying to change the direction of a tank. He just dragged me along for the ride, my feet scrabbling for purchase against the rough concrete.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I told him firmly. \u201cCaleb, you come back to me, or Lord help me, I will find a giant newspaper and whack you on the nose!\u201d</p><p>Angry, punctuated breaths puffed through his nostrils as his black eyes stared down at me. Letting out one last angry chuff, he pulled me to his chest, nuzzling my neck. I could add snuffling to the list of interesting angry sounds Caleb made as he rubbed his face into my hair. The growls died down to a rumbling purr. I sank against him, my arms suddenly stone-heavy. I dropped the baton to the asphalt with a clang as I wrapped my arms around his neck to stay upright. Caleb\u2019s breathing evened out, and his hands relaxed against the small of my back, rubbing wide circles. He reluctantly pulled away, cupping my face between his hands as he came back to himself.</p><p>He stared down at me, letting his eyes roam over my face, as if he was checking that all of my parts were still intact. He looked a little dazed, and then his pupils snapped back into focus.</p><p>And he did not look happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell were you thinking?\u201d he demanded, shaking my arms. \u201cI told you to stay with me. I told you I would keep you safe. And you run off the minute my head is turned? Do you realize what could have just happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Right, we were not going to discuss the fact that he\u2019d nearly phased in front of me. Then again, from what I\u2019d seen of pack behavior, he might not have realized he was doing it. The more time werewolves spent alone, away from their pack, the less aware they were of their \u201cwolf time.\u201d Cooper Graham had been so out of touch with his phasing cycle that he believed it when Eli made it look as if he\u2019d committed the aforementioned series of hiker maulings.</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t ask how Caleb was able to find me. It was probably better that I just ignore it in favor of being irritated about the whole shaking-me-like-a-naughty-child thing. Right?</p><p>I shoved my hands against Caleb\u2019s seemingly immobile chest until he relinquished his hold on my waist. I huffed. \u201cI left because I could. Because I am an adult, and I control my own decisions. You were making me nervous with all your bullet wounds and plastic handcuffs. I decided I was better off on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d He glanced down at the unconscious men at our feet. \u201cYou have everything under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was doing just fine,\u201d I muttered, shifting my shoulder bag and ignoring his quote-unquote compliment. \u201cI am still upright and conscious. So I think that means I win. And frankly, I did it without much help from you. You just distracted them and made scary faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary faces?\u201d he asked, his cheeks paling considerably.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you gave them full-on first-day-of-prison crazy eyes,\u201d I said, my laughter just a bit forced. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d swear they changed color for a second there.\u201d</p><p>He gave the world\u2019s most awkward chuckle. \u201cYeah, that would be weird, huh?\u201d</p><p>Really? I\u2019d just given him the perfect opportunity to talk about his other nature, and nothing? Really?</p><p>With a disappointed sigh, I gave his shin a little kick, making him smirk at me and ruffle my hair. He grumbled but grudgingly admitted, \u201cI want to rip them limb from limb, but what you did was probably better.\u201d He gestured to the crumpled forms on the ground.</p><p>Oddly pleased by his praise, I preened a bit. \u201cNever underestimate the short.\u201d</p><p>Caleb snorted. \u201cI think we need to clear out of here before they wake up. I\u2019m amazed the manager hasn\u2019t come out to yell at us for messing up his nice empty parking lot.\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him. If he was willing to follow me this far, he wasn\u2019t going to let me just walk away and plot my own course to Anchorage. And he was handy to have around when one was under attack by parking-lot perverts. Still, I had to give him a little grief. \u201cBut I\u2019m paid up for two more nights!\u201d I protested, although I will admit there wasn\u2019t much heat in it.</p><p>He cast a derisive look at the peeling green motel-room door. \u201cWell, that just goes to show that your judgment has been off in a lot of different areas.\u201d</p><p>I gave him my unamused dead-eyed stare. \u201cI\u2019m not above kicking you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m thinking about kicking you back. You left me a two-word good-bye note on a lampshade.\u201d He growled, as if he suddenly remembered that he was angry with me. \u201cTwo words: \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 What is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d I cried, throwing my hands up in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you yelling at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d I yelled. I frowned, looking down at Yellow Teeth and Grabby Hands. \u201cShould we stash them in my room?\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward Yellow Teeth. \u201cGet his feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d I gestured at Caleb\u2019s thick upper arms. \u201cYou came after me to \u2018protect\u2019 me, you might as well do the heavy lifting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come for you, I came for the baton,\u201d he said, scooping it up from where I\u2019d dropped it on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re just an amusing fringe benefit. So,\u201d he asked in a tone far too casual to be sincere, \u201cis there a reason you ran from me?\u201d</p><p>He was pretending to be looking down at Yellow Teeth and Grabby Hands, all the while staring sidelong at me. Could he be mulling over my lack of questions about his finding me? Or why I hadn\u2019t mentioned the strange yellow glow-y trick of light over his skin? Maybe the little peculiarities had built up to the point where a \u201cnormal\u201d girl couldn\u2019t have ignored them. Had it been a mistake to put that one last barrier between our real lives and what we were trying to show each other? Would I have too much to explain now if I told him I knew about were-creatures?</p><p>I opened my mouth to say, My ex-husband\u2019s determined stalking and your connections to my former employers, not to mention your werewolf issues, are freaking me out. But I lost my nerve and suggested, \u201cGeneralized anxiety. So how far are we going today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, apparently caught off-guard by my sudden change of topic. He peered around the abandoned parking lot. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that struck me as funny. I started laughing. And I kept laughing, even as Caleb chucked the unconscious guys into my motel room and locked the door, then led me toward the truck. He kept an arm around my waist, as if he was afraid I was going to collapse from shock or crippling hyena laughs. Instead of shrugging off his protective grip, I held on to his arm like a lifeline.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Rabbit,\u201d he said, gently lifting me into the truck while I wiped at my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been a long night\u2014day\u2014whatever.\u201d I sighed as he tucked my legs into the cab. I grabbed his arm before he could close the door. \u201cCaleb, thanks.\u201d</p><p>He gave me one curt nod and slammed the truck door.</p><p>We drove for the better part of two hours, my head leaning against the cool glass of the window. The strange white buzzing in my head had faded away, and I could feel my muscles unwind from the unbearable tension I\u2019d been under for the last few days. Caleb didn\u2019t say a word for the entire drive. He barely looked at me, keeping his eyes glued to the road, as if he wasn\u2019t driving on highways he\u2019d wandered on routinely for the better part of five years. I closed my eyes, grateful just to be able to rest them for a few moments.</p><p>My eyes snapped open as Caleb turned into a motel parking lot. The Burly Bear Inn was no Ritz-Carlton, but it was certainly in better shape than the Right-Price. All of the rooms in the newly painted three-story building had exterior doors, at least, which couldn\u2019t be said of my last \u201cresidence.\u201d Caleb hopped out of the truck and walked into the motel office, presumably to get a room. He even left the keys in the ignition. It was either a sign that he trusted me enough to leave me unsupervised in his truck or a test to see if I would run off again.</p><p>I bunched my hands into fists to avoid the temptation. Because this was not a conversation I wanted to have with Caleb. It wasn\u2019t a conversation I wanted to have with anyone. The only person I\u2019d ever discussed my marital \u201cdifficulties\u201d with was Red-burn, and that was over the phone. Talking about it face-to-face with Caleb would be considerably more painful.</p><p>Caleb emerged from the office after a few minutes, shoving a plastic key fob into his pocket. He opened my door, grabbed his duffel, and hooked my bag around his arm, nodding toward the first floor of rooms. I followed him, wondering where I would even start with my sad, sordid history.</p><p>Caleb unlocked the door, and I stepped inside the room, fidgeting and twisting my hands. He dropped the bags, his relentless stare pinning me to my spot on the questionable motel carpet. I took a deep breath. \u201cCaleb, I\u2014mrpgh.\u201d</p><p>Before I could make another sound, Caleb was across the room and kissing the absolute hell out of me. His arms snaked under my own and lifted me off the ground, the sheer force of the impact throwing my legs around his waist. My mouth dropped open in surprise, and his tongue slipped between my lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breathing. Breathing would be good. But I couldn\u2019t seem to draw air. His mouth was everywhere, nibbling my lips, trailing along my jaw, nipping at my throat, stealing all of my oxygen and rational thought. There were no muffled voices from the other rooms. There was no questionable carpet. Only warm lips, clashing teeth, and strong fingers digging into my hips.</p><p>I was so focused on the hot, insistent pressure against my mouth that I didn\u2019t notice that somewhere between the door and the bed, my shirt came off. I yanked at his jacket, pushing it from his shoulders as he stumbled back and landed against the mattress with a squeak. Our descent had just enough bounce to send me tumbling toward the edge of the bed, but Caleb caught me and rolled me back over him.</p><p>I barely resisted the urge to laugh into his bare chest, biting down gently on his Adam\u2019s apple. He moaned softly, threading his fingers through my short hair and pulling me closer. His hands stroked and petted, slowly peeling away my jeans and bra. My pulse jumped every time his hands brushed my breasts, and my hips jerked.</p><p>I lost track of time, getting acquainted with the body that, well, let\u2019s face it, I had been ogling for weeks. His skin was so smooth. I couldn\u2019t resist reciting the muscle-group names as I traced my fingertips along his arms, down his stomach and thighs. Deltoid, pectoralis major, external oblique, quadriceps femoris\u2014all connected and fairly shaking as I ran my hands over them.</p><p>He flipped me onto my back, growling low as he worried my collarbone with his teeth. Lips open and wet, he ran his mouth in one smooth line from my breasts to my belly button, pressing one last kiss to the little bow on the waistline of my panties. I giggled, until he nudged the panties aside and plunged two fingers inside me. Then I gasped, grinding my hips against the palm of his hand. I came with embarrassing speed, but it had been a very long time since someone had touched me. I threw my head back, panting as I felt that first spasm of my climax. I rode it out, wave after wave, until I was sweaty and still beneath him.</p><p>I heard the crinkle of foil as he settled between my thighs, peppering my breasts with kisses as he aligned our bodies. I hissed as parts of me long left ignored stretched and flexed around him. He stopped, hovering over me, watching me.</p><p>I felt overwhelmed by his size, the searing heat of his skin. I\u2019d never felt so small, so breakable, in a positive way. As his hands ghosted over my skin, I knew that I could trust him to be careful with me.</p><p>\u201cMove,\u201d I begged him. \u201cPlease move.\u201d</p><p>He obliged, thrusting his hips and driving me back into the mattress. I felt his teeth, worrying at the same spot on my neck he\u2019d attempted to bite before. Was this it? Was he going to claim me? He nuzzled my throat, scraping his sharp teeth over my skin. Just when I felt them digging in, I tensed, wincing away from the pain.</p><p>The silence of the room, punctuated only by the sound of our breathing, rang in my ears as he balanced his forehead against mine. He stroked a hand down my cheek and kissed me, long and hard. He grinned down at me and clutched at my ass, rolling against me until he hit a spot inside me that had me shuddering. Heat seared from my navel to my thighs, rippling up my body. The fluttering waves of release made me scream so loudly that our neighbors banged on the wall and told us in very colorful language that they did not appreciate my enthusiasm. Or volume. Or Caleb\u2019s long howl when he followed me over the edge.</p><p>Caleb rolled onto his back, wrapped his arms around me, and pulled me close. I clapped my hands over my mouth and muffled a giggle, because I figured laughing at our neighbors\u2019 protests would not improve their mood. Caleb did laugh, pressing his face against the crown of my head. He looked indecently pleased with himself. \u201cBeen a while, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour years, two months, two weeks, and three days. Not counting the sex I\u2019ve been having with myself, which was actually better than the two-party . . . never mind. So why weren\u2019t we doing this weeks ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, if I\u2019d had my way, we would have christened every motel between here and Canada,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut you were so jumpy before. You let me touch you, but you tensed up so much I was afraid that you would run off if I tried to get closer.\u201d He nipped at my earlobe. I turned my head, admiring the way the moonlight played on his features, making him look like the sullen canine he was. \u201cPlease don\u2019t run from me again,\u201d he whispered into my hair, winding his legs with mine. \u201cWhen I woke up and you were gone, Rabbit, I can\u2019t tell you how that made me feel. I didn\u2019t know where you\u2019d gone. I didn\u2019t know if you were OK, if I was ever going to see you again. I almost lost it.\u201d</p><p>His whole frame tensed up just talking about it. His eyes bled gold into dark brown and glowed against the dark backdrop of the room.</p><p>I wondered if almost losing it meant he\u2019d wolfed out and destroyed our motel room. What was the cleaning fee for something like that? Did he have a credit card devoted specifically to tacky-motel-room damage? I trailed my fingers along his cheek, stroking it in what I hoped was a soothing, non-werewolf-freak-out-inducing manner.</p><p>\u201cLook, Caleb, I know you\u2019re upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a massive understatement, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can we skip talking about it for right now?\u201d He opened his mouth to protest, so I added, \u201cYou have every right to be pissed, especially with the whole lampshade thing, and we have a lot of things we need to talk about. And we can yell and scream as much as you want later. But for right now, for the next few hours, can we just not?\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip and then bit mine. \u201cThere will be talking,\u201d he told me sternly. \u201cAnd possibly some yelling, but definitely a lot of talking, because there are things we need to talk about. Because you scared me. I\u2019m angry. But I\u2019m not going to do anything to make you run away again, because I missed you. Also because your running away again would just start the whole losing-it, pissed-off, scared cycle all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too.\u201d I craned my neck to press my lips to his and let my head drop to the pillow.</p><p>10</p><p>A Furry, Friendly Wake-Up Call</p> <p>Even if I did know about the existence of werewolves, it was still shocking as hell to wake up spooning with one.</p><p>I was still mostly asleep when I registered the feeling of a wide, warm tongue rasping down the length of my cheek.</p><p>\u201cMorning. That\u2019s different.\u201d I chuckled, pressing my face into the pillow. I squinted into the semidarkness of early dawn, running my fingers through Caleb\u2019s hair. It seemed coarser and thicker . . . and there was a lot more of it. In fact, it seemed to cover his entire body.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d I opened my eyes and found myself staring into the brown eyes of a huge gray wolf.</p><p>I scrambled out of bed, falling to the floor, scuttling back over the carpet into the wall. \u201cCaleb!\u201d</p><p>Our sonar-sensitive neighbor pounded on the bedroom wall, and I heard his muffled voice call, \u201cToo damn early for that! Decent people are trying to sleep!\u201d</p><p>Whining, the wolf shook his way up onto his haunches and stretched. He looked over the edge of the bed at me, head tilted to the side, as if he was trying to figure out why I was acting all weird. OK, OK, this wasn\u2019t a big deal. I\u2019d seen werewolves before. Unless they phased out of anger or fear, they were usually pretty calm. And Caleb wouldn\u2019t hurt me. It was just a shock to see him in his natural state. The Caleb wolf shook his head, and that golden light spread over the gray fur, slowly fading away to skin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d he said, scrambling toward me.</p><p>I flopped back against the wall, holding my hand up like a crossing guard. I looked up at my werewolf paramour, all panicked and wide-eyed. I looked down at the stray gray hairs on the sheets. And I burst out laughing. It was just so ridiculous, him crouching naked on the bedroom floor while asking me not to freak out over his wolf body. I laughed and laughed until I fell over. Until I realized I was touching nasty motel carpet and sat back up. I wiped at my eyes.</p><p>\u201cWerewolf.\u201d</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mouth flapped open like a guppy\u2019s as he stammered, \u201cUh-uh, no, you must be having a bad dream. Uh, yeah, that\u2019s it, there was no wolf here.\u201d</p><p>I smirked at him. \u201cAre you trying to Jedi-mind-trick me right now? \u2019Cause you kind of suck at it.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and followed with a weak \u201cMaybe you hit your head?\u201d His tone was uncertain and quiet, as if he didn\u2019t want our neighbors to overhear. He pulled my arms gently and led me to the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not running away and screaming. Why are you not running away and screaming?\u201d</p><p>I winced, biting my lip. Right, how to explain this . . . \u201cI kind of knew already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he exclaimed. I shushed him. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d He sat heavily on the bed, stared at me for a long moment, and then groaned. \u201cThe night I was shot. Did I say something?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, but my continued silence seemed to make him chatty. \u201cI just, uh, put some things together. You\u2019re not the first werewolf I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, really. I don\u2019t hurt anybody. I don\u2019t freak out under the light of the full moon. It\u2019s just a genetic condition, you know, like color blindness or being born with an extra toe. Just, you know, furrier.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, suddenly blank-faced. That was the saddest description of werewolf-dom I\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>\u201cSo how do you know about us?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cPromise you won\u2019t get mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t actually promise that,\u201d he said, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cBut I won\u2019t phase or yell or anything.\u201d</p><p>I leveled a doubtful look at him.</p><p>He nodded and walked to a corner, the farthest point in the room away from me. \u201cOK, hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working with werewolves for years. I was the pack doctor for your family in the valley for the past four years. I worked under the name Anna Moder.\u201d The words ran out of my mouth so quickly I was surprised he managed to pick up on what I\u2019d said. But I could tell it had registered by the shocked expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cThe cute little pack doctor Maggie was always going on about?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He sighed and then burst out laughing. \u201cDo you have any idea what I\u2019ve been going through trying to cover for my little issue? Do you know how hard it is for one of us to go this long without phasing regularly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, pressing my lips together to keep from laughing. Because antagonizing a naked werewolf seemed counterintuitive. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to freak you out, and I didn\u2019t know if I could trust you at first. And after that, it seemed a little late to tell you the truth, and I panicked, and here we are. Also, it was sort of funny to see how far you would go to try to conceal your wolfy tendencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know about everything?\u201d he asked, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cNot everything but most things. I treated Samson for a lot of different bramble- and bear-related injuries.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cBut you know my whole family?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve probably heard a few stories.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.</p><p>\u201cYou know about the incident with the moose, huh?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows arched. \u201cUh, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>I pushed myself to my feet and gestured to the bed. \u201cCan we get off the floor now that all our cards are on the table?\u201d</p><p>He practically dived across the room and under the covers, fluffing them into a strange, nestlike configuration around him. He lifted the corner to let me crawl in next to him. Leaning against the headboard, he pulled me against his chest. He pushed my tangled hair back from my face. \u201cSo you\u2019re a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly emergency medicine, but then I transferred to more of a family practice a few years ago. I had to leave that job for, uh, personal reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he muttered. When I shot him a confused look, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s just a surprise, that\u2019s all. I thought we were on a more even playing field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still the same person. I just have a couple extra pieces of paper you didn\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must have made a lot of money before, been comfortable. Why are you living in cheap motels and working in grocery stores?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI did make decent money early on in my medical career. I was very comfortable. And I can honestly tell you I have never been so miserable in my life. Living up here works better for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, and we both laughed a little.</p><p>\u201cBecause Glenn can\u2019t take it all away again. I had just enough time to start thinking of Tampa as home before he showed up and broke my face. And that was after he harassed me \u2018anonymously\u2019 at work until my new coworkers were scared to be seen with me or go out with me, because they didn\u2019t know what my crazy ex-husband would do. I made the people around me tense and nervous. It felt like I was taking everybody around me down with me.\u201d</p><p>Caleb seemed to grasp the fact that he needed to ignore the unusual number of details I\u2019d just let slip in favor of mocking me in some way. \u201cWhat was your plan? Just bounce around the country forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot forever, just a couple of years!\u201d I exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a crappy plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to your plan of waiting until you phased next to me in my sleep to tell me that you\u2019re a supernatural creature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to tell you!\u201d he protested. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing to fit into conversation, that\u2019s all. Do you realize how much easier this would have been for me if you\u2019d just told me you knew I was a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keeping secrets from me was my fault?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s . . . wrong. But people who live in lampshade-note-shaped houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones.\u201d He tapped me on the nose with his fingertip for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cAny other little secrets I should know about?\u201d</p><p>He pursed his lips. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou hesitated.\u201d</p><p>He made an alarmingly human helpless-man face, complete with flailing outstretched hands. \u201cAny guy would hesitate in response to that question!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no more surprises.\u201d</p><p>He raised his hand in a mockery of the Boy Scout salute. \u201cNot so much as a surprise birthday party. If you ever decide to tell me your real birthdate. I\u2019m assuming the one I found on your ID is fake.\u201d</p><p>I gasped. \u201cYou looked through my wallet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile you were asleep that night at the motel, when we went after Jerry,\u201d he said, wincing when I smacked him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was going to do some checking up on the woman riding in my truck and sleeping in my bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s cagey,\u201d I muttered into his skin.</p><p>He tucked my head under his chin and hugged me tight. \u201cGlenn\u2014that was his name?\u201d</p><p>I blinked, tensing up against him. Caleb rubbed circles on the small of my back to try to get me back into a relaxed state. Glenn was such an enormous part of my head space. Avoiding him was the motivation for so many aspects of my life, and I hadn\u2019t shared anything about him with Caleb, someone who had so recently taken up another considerable chunk of my thoughts. While I didn\u2019t want them to meet under any circumstances, it seemed unfair to shut such a big part of my life away from Caleb\u2014especially when Glenn could be the reason I eventually left.</p><p>I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and resolved to tell Caleb everything.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had one of those moments in your life where you wish you had a time-traveling DeLorean?\u201d I asked Caleb as he settled against my side to listen to my tale.</p> <p>11</p><p>Foxy Boxing Is Way More Difficult Than It Looks on Those Questionable Cable Channels</p><p>Caleb listened to every word, stopping me to ask a question here or there but never judging, never demanding answers. I poured out the whole sorry story and felt better for getting it off my chest. I explained about the e-mails and how Glenn claimed to have found me. And while he still wasn\u2019t happy with me for sneaking away instead of telling him, he dropped the subject. Exhausted by relating the sad story of my marriage, I fell asleep balanced on Caleb\u2019s chest and woke up just before noon. Caleb had left a note by the door (as far away from the lampshade as possible) stating that he\u2019d gone for a \u201crun.\u201d</p><p>I felt very sorry for the woodland creatures that might have crossed his path.</p><p>Unfortunately, this honesty seemed to have put another space bubble between us. Caleb suddenly seemed worried about rushing me physically or crowding me. He didn\u2019t sniff me or touch me casually as much as he did before. I had to initiate kissing or any other fun-time activities. I made it a point to become even more affectionate with him, to try to snap him out of it. But the stubborn wolf was going all noble on me.</p><p>Caleb managed to get Glenn\u2019s basic information out of me: name, last known address, birthdate. He seemed determined to find some solution for my situation, which was sort of sweet and at the same time a little insulting, as if he was going to magically find some easy fix I hadn\u2019t thought of yet. A nearly impossible-to-file restraining order, restarting my stalled divorce proceedings, even a legal name change\u2014all of that paperwork could be tracked and could lead Glenn right to my door. Living a little less legitimately was inconvenient, but it kept me off of Glenn\u2019s radar. It was my choice, and it made me feel safer. So I rebuffed these suggestions\u2014and any attempts to get personal information about Glenn\u2014with indifference and subject changes, making Caleb restless and snappish.</p><p>We didn\u2019t talk about my running away because we had new subjects to discuss, namely Glenn and my history with the werewolf pack. Caleb did, however, spend a lot of time talking to Suds, taking several calls out on the porch of the motel, despite temperatures dipping near the single digits. He was worried and agitated, and part of me wished I hadn\u2019t told him about my past. He knew everything now. He knew how damaged I was, and I couldn\u2019t be that quirky, mysterious girl who had saved him from a half-assed bullet wound.</p><p>One morning, he strode into our room and tossed me a case file. \u201cWe\u2019re going to Goose Creek. You have twenty minutes to pack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cOr at least, in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>I harrumphed at this sudden change in demeanor, as if he hadn\u2019t spent the last week in a state of grumpy old werewolf-ness. Phasing issues or no, I didn\u2019t appreciate mood swings that left me feeling gaslighted. I flipped through the file, reading the summary. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for a stripper named Trixie?\u201d</p><p>Caleb cast me another smirk. \u201cI think they prefer \u2018exotic dancer.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are we looking for a stripper named Trixie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s a question a man would never ask.\u201d</p><p>I gave him my best stink-eye, but he only grinned impishly at me. Holding his gator jerky over the garbage can got his attention.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he howled. \u201cTrixie is the errant girlfriend of Lolo Kardakian, medium-sized hood out of Anchorage. They\u2019ve had a disagreement.\u201d</p><p>I inadvertently dropped the bag of jerky, more out of surprise than revenge. \u201cWe\u2019re chasing down a woman to drag her back to her angry criminal boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard it is to find that brand of gator jerky?\u201d he asked, peering into the garbage can to see if the bag was salvageable.</p><p>\u201cYou have a jerky problem. Suds and I are going to have an intervention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to order it over the Internet!\u201d he exclaimed.</p><p>I dug a fingertip into his side, making him wince. \u201cCaleb!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not exactly dragging her back. Look, I know both of them pretty well. He isn\u2019t going to hurt her, he just wants a valuable item she took with her when he and she had their last, um\u2014\u201d</p><p>I raised my hand to cut him off. \u201cLet\u2019s go with \u2018date.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then. On their last date, Lolo informed Trixie that he wasn\u2019t planning on leaving his wife. And while he was in the shower, she took his wedding ring from the nightstand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just have the ring replaced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s Lolo\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s ring. It\u2019s an antique and apparently pretty distinctive. Plus, Lolo\u2019s sort of superstitious. He wants his wedding ring back. He\u2019s afraid that without it, his marriage will be doomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, his carrying on with a stripper named Trixie won\u2019t have any effect on it at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we have to do is get the ring back to Lolo in Anchorage. I thought you\u2019d be excited to finally get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI object to this job on moral grounds . . . on several levels. Quests for evil rings rarely turn out well. Too many potential Gollum issues. Also, I don\u2019t like the idea of working for a guy whose name could belong to a Star Trek villain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem\u2019s the breaks, sweetheart,\u201d he said, shrugging as I pouted. \u201cWe aren\u2019t actually taking custody of anyone, so your argument isn\u2019t valid. And you\u2019ve objected to most of the jobs we\u2019ve done together on some grounds. If it was up to you, we would let everybody go with a sternly worded warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cHow do we find this girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy buddy Abe owns a bar down in Goose Creek\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another member of the League of Caleb\u2019s Barkeep Super Friends,\u201d I interjected.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t mix Marvel and DC references. You\u2019re better than that,\u201d he said, shaking his head disdainfully. \u201cAs I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted, Abe\u2019s on Trixie\u2019s circuit. Most of these places can\u2019t keep girls on full-time. You don\u2019t find a lot of pretty girls willing to strip in a small town year-round. So these girls travel a sort of circuit a few months each year. The bar pays a flat fee, the girls keep all the tips. The male patrons see a little boob. Everybody walks away happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for feminists. And health inspectors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this going to be your attitude for the entire job? Because that will make it real difficult for me to enjoy working on this with you.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, although relief at seeing the old Caleb return was gradually setting in. \u201cAm I supposed to try to help you enjoy a job involving strippers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know how to answer that without getting poked in the ribs again.\u201d</p><p>Abe\u2019s bar, which was just called Abe\u2019s, was more respectable than most of the places we\u2019d visited so far. It was an old, shopworn sports bar, but it was clean. And nobody propositioned me as I walked through the front door, which I considered a much higher recommendation than any Zagat rating.</p><p>Of course, the lack of propositions could have had something to do with Caleb\u2019s arm being firmly wrapped around my waist, but why split hairs? The interior reminded me a lot of the Blue Glacier in Grundy: scarred pine bar, worn pine floorboards, neon beer signs, and taxidermically preserved fish specimens decorating the walls. Two obviously well-loved pool tables occupied the far corner of the room. Since one of them was marked with a little green \u201creserved\u201d sign, I assumed that one would serve as Trixie\u2019s stage for the evening.</p><p>There were plenty of perfectly respectable teetotalers in the Great North. But in some smaller towns out \u201cin the bush,\u201d bars and saloons served as the social hubs, sources of gossip and entertainment to break up the monotony of living in a place where a snowfall could mean being cut off from your neighbors for months. People didn\u2019t come for the booze so much as the conversation. The problem was that some bars were \u201cless nice\u201d than others and attracted people who were similarly less nice than the average citizen. It all depended on what the ownership was willing to let the patrons get away with.</p><p>My opinion of the caliber of the bar changed when a tall bottled redhead with an ass you could bounce a quarter off of sidled up to us, calling out to Caleb. My werewolf paled a little and pulled at the collar of his jacket.</p><p>\u201cMary Ann, hi,\u201d he said, clearly uncomfortable, which in some perverse way amused me immensely. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely.\u201d She scowled at me. \u201cThis your old lady now?\u201d</p><p>Caleb looked from her to me and back to her. And then back to me. \u201cUh . . .\u201d</p><p>Part of me enjoyed watching Caleb twitch a little bit. But a much more influential part of my brain wanted this woman away from us, away from my man, before I started some Maury Povich catfight, rolling around on the floor, pulling at her hair. So I decided to step in.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Caleb, don\u2019t try to hide our love,\u201d I cooed, stretching my arms around him. I beamed at her, all silly and cow-eyed. \u201cWe just got matching tattoos.\u201d</p><p>Mary Ann\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cReally? Can I see?\u201d</p><p>I winked at her. \u201cNot where we put them, no, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t want big commitments,\u201d she said to Caleb.</p><p>And the ever-erudite werewolf responded, \u201cUh . . .\u201d</p><p>She gave me one long, disdainful look. \u201cWhen you figure out what you\u2019re missing, you give me a call,\u201d she said, turning her back on me.</p><p>\u201cIt was really nice to meet you, Mary Ann!\u201d I chirped.</p><p>She sashayed away, her butt swishing back and forth. Caleb closed his eyes as if he was wishing the whole situation would go away. \u201cNever going to live this down, am I?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Before he could come up with some explanation, a tall blond man came barreling up to Caleb, pulled back his fist, and punched my werewolf square in the stomach.</p><p>Seriously, I couldn\u2019t take him anywhere.</p><p>Caleb grunted, doubling over and propping his hands against his knees to get his breath back. I hissed out a growl and yanked my trusty baton out of my bag. I flicked it to full extension, but Caleb pulled himself upright and grabbed my wrist before I could swing. \u201cNo! This is my old friend, Abe Clarkson.\u201d</p><p>Caleb took time off from reassuring me to swing up at Abe\u2019s gut, doubling him over. Abe gave a wheezing laugh right before using his lowered center of gravity to fly-tackle Caleb and send him toppling against a booth.</p><p>\u201cDo any of your old friends like you?\u201d I asked him as both men roared with laughter. None of the bar patrons seemed to notice the exchange, as if it was a regular occurrence for Abe to brawl with customers.</p><p>Caleb brought an elbow down between Abe\u2019s shoulder blades. \u201cNo, that\u2019s just how he says hi.\u201d</p><p>With Abe\u2019s grasp around Caleb\u2019s waist weakened, Caleb shoved his alleged friend halfway across the barroom. I assumed that the abusive greeting ritual had concluded, because Abe approached me, gave me a once-over, and waggled his eyebrows. \u201cWho is this sweet little thing, Caleb? You know, Mary Ann\u2019s been missing you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Caleb interrupted him with a loud clearing of the throat. \u201cAbe, this is my Tina. Behave yourself.\u201d</p><p>Abe instantly straightened up, his expression more friendly than flirty now. I guessed Caleb\u2019s calling me his held some sort of special significance. In a second, I\u2019d gone from hanger-on to lady of significance. I felt I deserved nonflirty respect either way, but given the eager, open smile on Caleb\u2019s face, I wasn\u2019t going to be churlish about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s very nice to meet you, Tina,\u201d Abe said, shaking my hand. \u201cI was afraid he was going to end up as the male version of a crazy old cat lady.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s still a possibility,\u201d I told him, making Abe frown at Caleb.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a kidder,\u201d Caleb assured him. \u201cShe\u2019s crazy about me.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201c \u2018Crazy\u2019 is a good word for it.\u201d</p> <p>Abe shot Caleb a sly look. \u201cOh, I like her. You deserve her, buddy. I\u2019m looking forward to watching how this plays out. You in a relationship? That\u2019s like one of those shows about guys who wrestle with wild gators. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to turn out, but it will be bloody, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m going to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Trixie here yet?\u201d Caleb asked, ignoring Abe\u2019s jab. \u201cI would like to snap her up before these guys figure out I\u2019m taking away their entertainment. That could get ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not due for another thirty minutes or so,\u201d Abe told him. \u201cYou got a minute, man. And I need a favor.\u201d Abe jerked his head toward his office. Caleb gave me a skeptical look, as if he didn\u2019t want to leave me alone, but I waved him off.</p><p>\u201cGo have fun,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time you said that, you ended up offering to show Jerry your boobs,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Abe\u2019s mouth popped open to comment, but instead, he asked, \u201cYou hungry?\u201d The blond man laughed at himself. \u201cWhat am I saying? You\u2019re with Caleb \u2018Jerky Hog\u2019 Graham. Of course you are.\u201d</p><p>Before I could respond, Caleb protested. \u201cThat was one time! And you left the bag in the truck. What was I supposed to do? Starve?\u201d</p><p>Abe shook his head, giving me a knowing look, and flagged down his bartender, a pretty brunette. \u201cA beer and a crab special for the lady. Anything she wants is on the house.\u201d</p><p>I started to protest, but Caleb lifted me up and deposited me on a bar stool.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he told me. \u201cSit here. Stay in one place. Please try to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the boss of me,\u201d I informed him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, but as someone who cares about you, I am only asking that you eat a good meal and try not to jump directly into harm\u2019s way, waving a sign that says, \u2018Here I Am!\u2019 in big red letters.\u201d</p><p>I hated it when he made sense. \u201cI don\u2019t have a sign,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s invisible to everything but trouble,\u201d he told me, making me laugh.</p><p>\u201cAugh,\u201d Abe groaned. \u201cI was wrong. This isn\u2019t funny. It\u2019s adorable. I wasn\u2019t expecting adorable. I hate adorable.\u201d He grabbed the scruff of Caleb\u2019s neck and dragged him toward a door marked \u201cOffice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never understand men,\u201d I told the brunette behind the bar. The airbrushing on her shirt identified her as Pam.</p><p>Pam shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s comforting.\u201d</p><p>In a few minutes, I was served a surprisingly delicious sandwich consisting of a whole-wheat roll stuffed to the brim with a spicy, fresh King crab salad. Not exactly the greasy fried bar food I\u2019d come to expect. I dived into that sandwich as if seafood was about to be declared illegal. The cold, delicately seasoned crab was perfectly complemented by a peppery citrus dressing. It was the perfect accompaniment to the creamy wild-rice soup and beer. I hadn\u2019t eaten this well since the valley. I savored the dish and the opportunity to eat in a little island of silence in the crowded, conversation-filled room.</p> <p>And it gave me an opportunity to consider the implications of our conversation with Mary Ann. Caleb was one of those werewolves who played sex roulette with tavern wenches. How was I supposed to feel about that? But I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to follow Mary Ann\u2019s act. She looked like the kind of girl who knew tricks. Or turned them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pay what Mary Ann said any mind,\u201d Pam said, sliding a fresh beer in front of me. \u201cShe\u2019s been after him for the better part of a year. Never could take a hint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they never . . .\u201d I left that question hanging in the air, along with several vague hand gestures.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, they probably did,\u201d Pam said. \u201cBut Caleb never made any promises or anything.\u201d</p><p>I thunked my head against the bar and groaned.</p><p>He\u2019d never made me any promises, either. He clearly liked me. But he\u2019d never said he loved me. And although I\u2019d tried to skirt around those feelings for a good while, I knew they were there. I still believed in love. It was impossible not to when you were surrounded by a bunch of people who mated for life. I saw how fiercely werewolves could love, with everything they had. But Caleb never mentioned anything about love, just safety and protection. And he certainly didn\u2019t say anything about the long term, just that I should stay with him. He never said how long he wanted me beside him.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m sure that you two . . .\u201d Pam continued. I looked up at her, eyebrows furrowed. She pursed her lips. \u201cI\u2019m going to stop talking now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>Pam busied herself behind the bar, leaving me to pick at the remains of my sandwich.</p><p>This was such an inconvenient moment to figure out that I was in love with Caleb. It wasn\u2019t unreasonable. There were so many reasons to love him. Yes, he was handsome. And yes, he was strong. But Caleb was also a good man, as different from Glenn as night is from day. He was pragmatic when it came to his job, but he was kind. He didn\u2019t hurt people because it felt good to him. While he might be aggressive, he wasn\u2019t passive-aggressive. When he was upset, he still talked to me. He made me laugh, even when I didn\u2019t want to. He didn\u2019t tell me what to do, what to wear, who to talk to. If he told me he was trying to protect me, that\u2019s what he was trying to do. He wasn\u2019t trying to separate me from people who might see what he really was, how he was treating me, that what we had wasn\u2019t normal.</p><p>Caleb had never said he loved me. But he saw what was good in me, even when I tried to hide it. He treated me like something precious. Not untouchable, not some ideal version of myself that I couldn\u2019t live up to.</p><p>How had this happened to me? I was on the run from the man who\u2019d promised me the world. And I\u2019d fallen in love with an emotionally unreliable werewolf who\u2019d promised me nothing.</p><p>It was a shame advice columns didn\u2019t cover issues like this.</p><p>Pam must have felt guilty for sending me on this depressing thought train, because she stopped in front of me and told me, \u201cI meant it, what I said before. I\u2019ve known Caleb for a long time now. And I\u2019ve never seen him look at anybody the way he looks at you.\u201d</p><p>I shot her a grateful half smile, just as my cell phone beeped in my coat pocket. I pulled out the little prepaid smartphone and saw a new message waiting in my e-mail notifications. Red-burn had sent me a message with the subject line \u201cPackage en route.\u201d Just then, Caleb and Abe stepped out of the office, laughing and elbowing each other in the ribs. Caleb caught my eye and beamed at me, which Abe used as an opportunity for a shot to the kidneys. Caleb winced, making Abe cackle, and the two of them started punching each other again. I rolled my eyes, but it was nice to be included in that moment. I was relaxed and happy and full, so of course, that was the moment Caleb\u2019s incredibly punctual stripper wandered into my line of sight, having just come out of the ladies\u2019 room in a revealing parody of a police uniform.</p><p>Trixie was a built blond Valkyrie who looked much shorter in her pictures. She was nearly as tall as Caleb, her athletic, busty frame stretching the polyester she wore to the limits of its structural integrity.</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder toward Caleb, whose continued wrassling with his buddy prevented him from spotting her. I tried clearing my throat and waving my arms and considered whipping a beer bottle at them, but that seemed like an overreaction. We weren\u2019t going after Trixie per se, just the ring she was wearing, so I had no real problem with intervening on Caleb\u2019s behalf. But how to go about it? Trixie was considerably bigger than Jerry or Mort had been, and I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d have any scruples about hitting another girl. I would need a carefully considered, multifaceted plan.</p><p>I hopped off my bar stool and planted myself between this very large lady and her destination, calling, \u201cHey, Trixie!\u201d</p><p>Right, good plan.</p><p>Lord, she\u2019s tall.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you need to move it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you keep those little star pasties on?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my way!\u201d Trixie said in a commanding tone.</p><p>\u201cDid you take a lot of dance classes when you were getting started, or did you mostly get on-the-job training? Because, you know, I am thinking about going into . . . pole work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, unless you want me to break that pretty face of yours, you\u2019d better let me through,\u201d she said, glaring down at me. \u201cBut with a little work up top, I think you could make a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks\u2014hey!\u201d I said, looking down at my little teacup breasts.</p><p>Which gave Trixie the opportunity to shove me aside and make for the bathroom door.</p><p>I looked across the bar to Caleb, who had finally noticed Trixie. He was trying to push through the crowd, but they were getting rowdy, seeing Trixie and assuming that it was almost time for their show. Trixie was barricaded in by the bodies, and this would be the perfect opportunity to whack her from behind with a pool cue . . . if I was capable of such cowardice. And then she turned on me, and I was pretty sure, given the expression on my face and the cue in my hand, that she knew what I was thinking.</p><p>She growled and made a grab at my hair. I ducked out of the way, bobbling my cue as I sidestepped her. She rounded, and I raised my fists, but honestly, I was afraid to take a swing at her. I wasn\u2019t sure how I was supposed to play this. From what I\u2019d seen of \u201cbikini boxing\u201d on those tacky testosterone channels on cable, it was more about bouncing around and putting on a show than actually trading blows. Why didn\u2019t I switch the TV to one of those more respectable female MMA fights? Why?</p><p>Sensing my hesitation, she drew back her arm and plowed her fist right into my face. It hurt, but what disappointed me was the way the punch had me bouncing my ass against the scarred wooden floor. That was demoralizing.</p><p>Trixie sneered and turned her back on me to run for the front door. I sprang up from the floor and jumped onto her back to slow her down, but man, she was fast on those big plastic heels.</p><p>\u201cGet off of me!\u201d she shouted as I dragged her backward.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said. \u201cGive us the ring.\u201d OK, now I definitely felt like Gollum. And if she kept batting at my face with those acrylic nails, I was going to look like him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about!\u201d she cried, tossing me off of her. My grip on her shirt popped the Velcro closures, splitting it open for all to see as I smacked against the nearby pool table. Instead of taking the time to appreciate how much that hurt, I launched myself at her. I\u2019d hoped the element of surprise would help me knock her back off her feet, but she caught me and damn near threw me over her shoulder.</p><p>She swung at the closest thing to her hands: my head. Since she took no precautions against marking my face, I showed her the same lack of courtesy. And I ended up getting tossed to the floor for my efforts. I could see Caleb\u2019s anxious face bobbing over the shoulders of those standing closest to us. He couldn\u2019t break through the crowd without displaying some serious werewolf strength.</p><p>Note to self: Leave the fighting to Caleb. He\u2019s much better at it.</p><p>I jumped to my feet, delivering an uppercut to her chin. The crowd cheered when I followed through with the elbow so that it caught her cheek as her face whipped forward. She bent forward, clutching her face. I brought her head crashing down on my knee and kicked out at her legs, knocking her off her stripper heels. She used her position to sweep my legs out from under me.</p><p>From there, there wasn\u2019t much strategy, just the two of us swinging away at whatever we could reach. I think I may have punched her in her spangled red bikini top. By that point, I wasn\u2019t able to see so well out of my swollen right eye, so hitting her in the boob was a distinct possibility.</p><p>\u201cCome on, ladies, break it up,\u201d Caleb said, peeling me off of her and setting me on my feet.</p><p>\u201cCrazy little bitch!\u201d Trixie spat.</p><p>\u201cLook, all we want is the wedding ring,\u201d I told her as Caleb carted me outside of swinging distance. \u201cWe just need the ring, and we\u2019ll get out of your face.\u201d</p><p>Trixie nodded slowly, considering. Caleb put me on my feet, and I approached her.</p><p>I patted her arm. In a gentler voice, I told her, \u201cIf you want, I will personally deliver pictures of you straddling one of those beefy fellas to Lolo, so he knows what he\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>Trixie nodded again, but this time, she was swaying on her feet. I didn\u2019t think it was because of my vicious blows.</p><p>\u201cOK, OK,\u201d she panted, slipping the ring off her finger. \u201cJust take it. I didn\u2019t want the stupid r-ring . . . any-anyway.\u201d</p><p>As she dropped it into my waiting palm, a red flush crept across her skin, and her breathing went unsteady and shallow.</p><p>I shoved the ring into my pocket. \u201cHey, are you OK?\u201d</p><p>Trixie shook her head, just before her eyes rolled up and she collapsed to the floor. Her head bounced off the planks with a sickening crack.</p><p>\u201cTrixie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, get up,\u201d Pam called. \u201cShe beat you fair and square, Trix. Have some dignity.\u201d</p><p>I knelt over Trixie, prying her eyelids apart, watching through my good eye to see if her pupils responded to the harsh lights of the bar.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think she\u2019s really sick,\u201d I told the bartender as I watched Trixie\u2019s lips swell. If this reaction was what I suspected, her airway could swell shut in minutes, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe. And contrary to every medical TV show ever made, it\u2019s not that easy to improvise intubation with an empty ballpoint pen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTrixie!\u201d I called. \u201cTrixie, do you have any allergies?\u201d The only response I got was a muffled grunt. I looked up at the bartender. \u201cDo you know if she has any allergies?\u201d</p><p>Pam shrugged. \u201cJust shellfish. You know, shrimp and stuff? But she\u2019s really careful to . . .\u201d Pam glanced back at the remains of my sandwich and my hands, which were touching Trixie\u2019s neck. \u201cOhhh.\u201d</p><p>I raised my crab-contaminated hands away from Trixie\u2019s skin and dashed for the bar. I grabbed a prepackaged pair of yellow rubber kitchen gloves from the bar sink. \u201cIs there a clinic in town?\u201d I asked. Pam nodded. \u201cCall them and explain the situation. Tell the doctor that we\u2019ve got anaphylaxis, plus a possible concussion. We\u2019re going to need Benadryl and an epi shot, plus fluids. You got that?\u201d</p> <p>Pam nodded and dialed the phone behind the bar.</p><p>I looked to Abe. \u201cGo into the ladies\u2019 room and get Trixie\u2019s bag. She probably has an EpiPen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go into the ladies\u2019 room!\u201d Abe protested.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency,\u201d I told him, depressing Trixie\u2019s swollen tongue with my gloved fingers. \u201cAnd you own the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, right,\u201d Abe mumbled sheepishly, before booking across the room to the bathroom door.</p> <p>Caleb dropped to his knees beside me, watching me with a confused expression. \u201cIs she faking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fake that,\u201d I said, nodding toward her swollen mouth and face. I folded Caleb\u2019s jacket and placed it under Trixie\u2019s head, tilting her head back to keep her airway open. \u201cShe must be pretty sensitive if contact with my hands could make her react like this. Of course, I bloodied her lip, which may mean the shellfish contaminants got into her bloodstream.\u201d</p><p>Abe jogged back to us with a pink camouflage canvas rolling bag. I unzipped it and dug through a rainbow of sateen bustiers, feather boas, and thongs, until I found a small toiletry bag kept separate from the enormous makeup kit stuffed inside the lid. The black nylon bag was cleaner and newer than the makeup kit and was clearly used less. I unzipped it and found a plastic tube with a purple label marked \u201cEpiPen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone have any scissors or a knife?\u201d I called. \u201cI need to split her pants.\u201d</p><p>Sheepish again, Abe knelt beside me and reached for the hem of Trixie\u2019s uniform pants. He gave the leg of her pants a sharp jerk, and they split up to the knee. He pulled at the tear-away pants, splitting the Velcro to her thigh. My mouth hung open for a moment before I snapped myself out of it and removed the tube\u2019s flip-top. I clicked the blue release button and jabbed the auto-injector into her outer thigh, holding it there to make sure the medicine was injected.</p><p>I kept my fingers at Trixie\u2019s throat, waiting for the telltale spike in her pulse. In a few seconds, the swelling in her lips decreased ever so slightly. Her legs began to twitch and shake, as if she had been zapped with a cattle prod. This was a normal nerve response to the epinephrine, something patients complained bitterly about, along with nausea, anxiety, and bouts of the shakes. Of course, I\u2019d be anxious if I\u2019d had a stranger jab an injection into my bare thigh.</p> <p>I took another jacket from a patron who stood nearby ogling the red spangly top peeking through Trixie\u2019s uniform shirt. I glared at him while I draped the jacket over her chest. She needed to stay warm.</p><p>A handsome middle-aged man in a maroon St. Nicholas Clinic sweatshirt barreled into the barroom, black leather medical bag in hand. He spotted the woman on the floor and made a beeline for us.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell happened to this woman?\u201d he demanded, examining the swelling and bruises on her face.</p><p>\u201cWe had a minor difference of opinion before she went into anaphylactic shock,\u201d I said.</p><p>He looked up at me, blue eyes flashing as if he was about to light into me about her condition. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re in much better shape, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said disdainfully.</p><p>I pressed my gloved hand to my mouth and drew back yellow latex smeared with blood. Well, that certainly explained the stinging in my lip. I turned to Caleb, who was glaring at the doctor. Maybe he didn\u2019t appreciate his tone with me?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad,\u201d Abe assured me.</p><p>Groaning, I peeled off the contaminated gloves and reached toward the box of proper medical gloves in the doctor\u2019s bag. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p> <p>The doctor gave a curt nod. \u201cNed Mabry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnna Moder,\u201d I told him, the name rolling off my tongue on autopilot, then I rattled off a succinct description of Trixie\u2019s condition. \u201cPatient engaged in a fistfight that ended with a blow to the back of her head when she hit the floor. Patient has a severe allergy to shellfish and had contact with residue from a crab salad sandwich. Before hitting her head, she developed respiratory difficulty and early-stage swelling of the lips and tongue. I auto-injected a point-three-milligram dose of epinephrine that the patient carried with her in her purse. Swelling has reduced. Patient is responding as expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Nurse Moder.\u201d Dr. Mabry nodded, checking Trixie\u2019s vitals.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Doctor Moder,\u201d I snapped, irritated that, like a lot of male doctors, Mabry had assumed that a woman with medical knowledge ranked below him. I ignored the way Caleb\u2019s eyebrows winged up. Stupid pride.</p><p>\u201cPardon me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know a lot of doctors who engage in fistfights at stripper bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re exotic dancers,\u201d I corrected, becoming more and more irritated with this guy. \u201cAnd it\u2019s none of your business what I\u2019m doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve provided appropriate treatment,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take her to the clinic for overnight observation, but she should make a full recovery. I\u2019m open until ten if you want to follow up with her.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Trixie was loaded onto a gurney and wheeled away to the clinic. The crowd, which had seen more than its fair share of entertainment that evening, dispersed. I sat heavily on the pool table, swiping at my busted lip with antiseptic. Caleb was at my side in a flash, taking over dabbing duties and then leading me to Abe\u2019s office to make full use of his first-aid kit. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Million Dollar Baby. No matter what I say, do not pull the plug, OK?\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should go to the clinic and let the doctor check you,\u201d he suggested anxiously.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you would know. You really are a doctor, huh?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the fancy piece of paper I bought on the Internet says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, even under the circumstances, it was neat to get to see you work. You usually don\u2019t speak with that kind of authority and confidence.\u201d I opened my mouth to protest, but Caleb added, \u201cIt was a good thing. I felt like I was seeing the real Tina. I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing more of her.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and kissed my bruised lip, making me wince. \u201cMy face hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He pressed a gentle kiss to the tip of my nose.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, she has you so whipped,\u201d Abe groaned from the doorway. He wrinkled his face in disgust. \u201cWhat did I tell you about being all cutesy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps I can\u2019t remember because of the stripping Amazon who pummeled my head!\u201d I shot back, glaring at both of them. \u201cA warning about her being Godzilla in a bikini would have been nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, to express our apologies\u2014and our appreciation for not letting our friend die from the food at my bar\u2014here you go.\u201d Abe pressed an envelope into my hand. \u201cThe fellas wanted me to give you this.\u201d</p><p>I opened it, amazed at the green profusion of singles that sprang forth from its confines. \u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, my guys took bets on the fight. You won on fourteen-to-one odds. That\u2019s a pretty decent cut of the proceeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen to one? That\u2019s kind of hurtful,\u201d I said, staring down at the envelope of crumpled bills. \u201cI tell you what, why don\u2019t you give my share to Trixie?\u201d I said, pressing the money back into his hand. \u201cTell her it\u2019s to help with her medical bills. It\u2019s my fault for exposing her to the crab anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good people, Tina.\u201d Abe nodded and produced a bloody raw steak from behind his back. Before I could protest, he slapped it against my bruised eye.</p><p>I yelped. \u201cThere\u2019s no medical proof that this works.\u201d</p><p>Caleb snorted. \u201cSteak is Abe\u2019s answer to most problems. You know, I keep trying to keep you out of situations where people are swinging at you. And you keep jumping right back into them. I give up. Jump away. Maybe if you\u2019re actively trying to get hurt, you\u2019ll stay safe, like reverse psychology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t mean for it to happen this time. But it was oddly therapeutic. Getting hit and getting back up,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s like facing my biggest phobia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go doing any more \u2018therapy\u2019 for a while, OK?\u201d he grumbled, before observing in wonder, \u201cYou gave Trixie your cut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it felt weird taking money for beating someone up. Also, there were some questionable stains on some of the bills,\u201d I said, shuddering.</p><p>It took some convincing to prevent Caleb from actually carrying me out of the bar. He drove me right back to the motel and started the shower, helping me out of my clothes and tsking over my bruises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to just jump you this time,\u201d he rumbled. \u201cThis is me, very slowly, very deliberately, going about the business of us having sex. We\u2019re going to talk about your \u2018no-fly zones\u2019 and protection and the possibility of you getting pregnant, since there\u2019s a really good chance of that happening, what with the werewolf sperm and all\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off with a kiss. \u201cPlease stop talking.\u201d</p><p>He nodded sharply, muttering into my mouth, \u201cOh, thank God.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he lunged at my mouth, kissing and licking and biting, until he\u2019d explored every inch of it. We slid under the blissfully warm spray, and I winced as it beat against my face. I braced my arms against the wall, letting the water sluice down my back.</p><p>Warm hands brushed down the length of my spine. I jumped, nearly knocking my head into the wall, but Caleb\u2019s hand cradled my skull and guarded it from the impact. I turned, my feet slipping a little on the tub surface as I wound my arms around his neck. I pressed my head into the hollow of his throat while his hands stroked my back.</p><p>The water cascaded over us, rippling over his skin. I ran my fingers along the line of his ribs, making him jump. I giggled, making him grin as he gently poked at my ticklish sides. He swallowed my indignant squeal. His fingers curled around my hip, and he hitched my legs around his waist. Already encased in a condom, he lined up our bodies and slid forward with aching hesitation. I gasped, and his tongue darted into my mouth, the water moving over our mouths.</p><p>I tipped my head back against the door, breathing hard, pinned there like a butterfly. Caleb\u2019s hair was dripping over his forehead, inky black, as he loomed over me. His eyelashes stuck together, spiky and wet. I nodded, moving my hips up to meet him. He relaxed, grinding me into the wall, sliding me up and down as we moaned in unison.</p><p>Just when we\u2019d worked out an easy rhythm, the water ran cold, and I practically vaulted us out of the shower. Laughing, he carried me to the bed, gently dropped me onto the bedspread, and crawled over me.</p><p>As if he wanted to remind me that I was dealing with a dangerous supernatural creature, he bit down on my bottom lip. I dragged my nails down his back, making him hiss. His skin was so hot. It practically radiated against my palms as I stroked his back.</p><p>His fingers pressed down over my hips, pulling me back, aligning me with him. I felt him between my thighs, warm and hard and thick. I leaned forward and bit the skin of his hand, the delicate web between his thumb and forefinger.</p><p>He yowled in protest, but he didn\u2019t stop. His fingers cupped the back of my neck, cradling my throat and pulling me back against his chest, nipping and biting the sensitive skin. His hands trailed over my arms, pressing my palms against the bedspread as his teeth sank just a bit deeper. I cried out, freeing one hand to reach back into his hair, and yanked before he could break the skin.</p><p>His hips pushed me into the rhythm he needed without keeping me from what gave me pleasure. His warm, deft fingers trailed down my back, around my hip, and between my thighs, to find that special little bundle of nerves. My hips stuttered as he teased me there, and the very small part of my brain still capable of thinking vowed horrible, anatomically specific revenge if he didn\u2019t continue doing exactly that for, oh, maybe a month.</p><p>A wonderful pressure rippled down my spine, through my belly, and I was falling, rising, spinning, all at once. I lost all sense of balance, falling forward and clawing at the arm around my waist as dark, pulsing shudders racked my body. Caleb pitched forward and nearly knocked me facedown onto the comforter. He hitched me up, hugging me to his chest and balancing me on his lap, while he guided my hips up and down. Because I didn\u2019t have the coordination to do that for myself.</p><p>I felt him shake and give a long, guttural moan before flopping to his side, pulling me down with him. Our breathing evened out, and I could move my legs again, rolling my ankles from side to side just so I could feel the pleasant little aftershocks that fired down to my toes.</p><p>Caleb was staring at me in that analytical way of his, trying to gauge my reaction.</p><p>\u201cAnd suddenly, sex happened,\u201d I muttered into the pillow.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s mussed head popped up over my shoulder. \u201cSlower, sweeter, romantic-comedy sex will happen later, I promise. Sorry most of it was against a shower wall.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s probably the cleanest surface in the room.\u201d</p><p>He was particularly interested in my tattoos, now that he was seeing them up close. He wanted to know why I\u2019d chosen that design, when I\u2019d started them, and whether I planned to get more. He traced the length of my spine with his lips, biting lightly at the ridge of each vertebra.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my personal star chart,\u201d I murmured into the pillows. \u201cIt\u2019s how I keep track of where I\u2019ve been.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t most people use stars to keep track of where they are?\u201d he asked, chuckling into my skin, tracing the outline of one with his tongue. I think he was somewhere near the Topeka star.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was going to do push-pins, but they weren\u2019t as pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as the tattoo kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, but that was sort of the point. Don\u2019t you have any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a very strict mother,\u201d he said, smiling into my skin.</p> <p>\u201cI think you would look awesome with a tattoo,\u201d I told him, rolling over so I was facing him. \u201cYou could get a butterfly, right here.\u201d I stroked the tramp-stamp area of his lower back. He chuckled again, jerking a little as my fingers stroked a particularly ticklish section of his back. \u201cOr something tribal.\u201d He snorted. \u201cThe Chinese symbols for love and strength . . . which inevitably will translate to \u2018clich\u00e9 tattoo.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little alarming that you came up with those ideas so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpent a lot of time thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a very strange girl.\u201d</p><p>I rolled over, balancing my chin on his chest. \u201cDid you really have a strict mother?\u201d</p><p>It seemed a little wrong, asking about his runaway human mom when I knew a little bit of the history. But I wanted to hear more about Caleb from his own mouth, his own version. The story I\u2019d heard about cruel, thoughtless Lydia Graham, who had forgotten the promises involved in mating and left her husband and child to themselves, had been twisted in the telling by so many indignant werewolf housewives that I didn\u2019t know if I could trust it.</p> <p>He blanched a bit at the question. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. I mean, she didn\u2019t stick around long enough for me to figure her out. She left when I was five. Dad met her when he was traveling in Washington State. He told her that he lived in the middle of nowhere, Alaska, but I don\u2019t think she really got it until she moved there. And then she was stuck. Not stuck the way you were,\u201d he clarified carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t remember them fighting or yelling or Dad being anything but good to her. It was seeing the same people every day, having the same conversations. Dad said he thought it drove her a little crazy. So she waited until I was in school one morning and ran for it.\u201d</p><p>As a woman who had once run for it, I could sympathize with Lydia and the desperation she must have felt to have taken such a step. But at the same time, how could she leave her little boy behind? I was thankful, at least, that she\u2019d left him with other werewolves so he wouldn\u2019t go through his transformation without that support. And in some remote, gloomy corner of my mind, I couldn\u2019t help but think that he was repeating his father\u2019s cycle all over again, choosing a woman\u2014however temporarily\u2014who would inevitably leave him. Freud would have a field day with Caleb Graham.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever hear from your mom?\u201d I asked, running my fingers through his hair.</p><p>He leaned into the caress and shook his head. \u201cWasn\u2019t interested. She made her choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your dad?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe always missed her. He was a good dad. He loved me like crazy, did all of the things a dad was supposed to, but you could tell life was just a little bit less than it should have been for him.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a little half smile and kissed him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what it is. Yeah, it sucks, and my life could have been better. But there were people in my family who had it a lot worse. So I can\u2019t really complain.\u201d He rolled onto his side and slid his hand down my stomach, tracing each of my ribs with his fingertips.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was it like growing up in the valley?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was the best kind of childhood for a little kid,\u201d he said, sighing. \u201cI spent a lot of time playing in the woods with Samson and Cooper. Maggie was the little sister I never really wanted. We were always chasing something, hunting, running around. Cooper and Samson lost their dads pretty early on, so my dad took them under his wing, so to speak. He taught us how to fix a car, clear a clogged sink, skin a deer with your bare teeth, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds idyllic, in a twisted Tom Sawyer kind of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had to grow up fast. Cooper became the alpha when we were just teenagers. And then that other pack tried to take over the valley, and everything got so screwed up. It just seemed easier to pull away from all that confusion. I knew my dad was disappointed that I moved away, but it just didn\u2019t feel right for me to be there anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it Suds who got you into the whole werewolf-tracker-for-hire business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and he doesn\u2019t know what I am, by the way,\u201d he replied. \u201cI was the valley\u2019s police force before I left. Usually, the alpha takes on the role along with mayoral duties. But we didn\u2019t have an alpha when Cooper left, and I was able to fill in. I liked it. Mostly, it involved keeping the younger wolves in line and corralling my idiot uncles when they tied one on. But every once in a while, some unsavory character would wander into town, thinking it would be a nice place to set up a meth lab, and I would have to explain why this was not a good idea. In following up on the background information for these yahoos, I was amazed at what I managed to discover online. And in a lot of cases, these guys\u2014and sometimes girls\u2014had warrants or rewards for information leading to their arrests. With my extra senses, I could track them, even after they left the valley. I made quite a bit of money that way. And I made some good contacts as I traveled around. So when I left, it seemed a natural fit for me to do it full-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it kill you, being away from the packlands for this long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hard, at first. I couldn\u2019t stay away for long stretches at a time without really pushing myself. But it got easier with time.\u201d He gave me a crooked little smile. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for isn\u2019t in the packlands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s nice and cryptic, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am assuming that you have one. You weren\u2019t hatched. We\u2019ve established, thanks to your alarming deceptive tactics, that you are an only child. What about your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents died a few years ago,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. What were they like?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated and cursed myself for it. He\u2019d shared with me, I reminded myself, and he didn\u2019t have to. So instead of giving him the pat answer I\u2019d developed for Anna Moder, I told him about Jack and Marcy Campbell.</p><p>\u201cNice people,\u201d I said, smiling when he slid his lips along the ridge of my hip. \u201cHigh school sweethearts. Mom owned an interior-design business, and Dad ran a construction firm. They loved each other very much. They taught me what marriage was supposed to look like. I just didn\u2019t pay close enough attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll know what to look for next time,\u201d he told me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if there will be a next time for me,\u201d I said, yawning.</p><p>Caleb\u2019s head jerked up, his expression alarmed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I sniffed. \u201cI\u2019m thinking maybe polygamy next time around. Civil union with two or three guys. I think there would be less pressure that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re hilarious.\u201d He groaned, digging his fingertips into my sides, making me jump all over the bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you keep falling for it!\u201d I exclaimed as he tickled my sides. To escape the torture, I went with my only available distraction technique. I kissed him, long and hard, sliding my hands over his and directing them to more interesting, less ticklish parts of my body.</p><p>He tapped his finger between my eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that look on your face. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I see your wolf form again?\u201d I asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a very good look at you the other day.\u201d</p><p>Caleb frowned. \u201cRight here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand way over there, out of range,\u201d I promised, scrambling out of bed and wrapping a sheet around my waist as I hid behind the oak nightstand.</p><p>Caleb grumbled, but he got out of bed and stood in the middle of the room. He rolled his shoulders and made a sort of squinting face. I giggled a little, which broke his concentration, making him whine, \u201cThis is awkward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, centering himself. That same golden light spread from his heart, over his skin, dragging his human form in its wake. The light winked out, and standing in front of me was a huge iron-gray wolf, big chocolate eyes twinkling. He made a whuffling noise, as if to say, Well?</p><p>I knelt in front of him, letting his cold, wet nose tap against my face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d I sighed, running my fingers through his thick fur. He nosed against my neck, bumping his head against mine. \u201cSuch a big, beautiful boy.\u201d</p><p>I scratched him behind the ears, cooing over him. He pressed his nose against my shoulder, knocking me back on my butt. I giggled as he hunched over me, licking my face. He phased back to human and was pressing kisses all over my face.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is awkward.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>12</p><p>The Gift Horse Has Some Awesome Teeth</p><p>It had taken me much longer than I\u2019d hoped, but we finally arrived in Anchorage. The snow was falling in earnest, giving the already alien city lights an otherworldly glow. Everything seemed far too bright, too neon, too busy. I found myself blinking in the glare of a stoplight.</p><p>I gave a fleeting thought to Red-burn and the post office she planned to use across town, but then Caleb asked me to locate Lolo\u2019s \u201cconstruction office\u201d on the GPS system. I declined the honor of meeting him, electing to stay out in the truck while Caleb delivered the wedding ring to a snazzy office building in a nearly empty business park.</p><p>Caleb was all smiles when he emerged from the transaction. As part of our payment, Lolo booked us a room at the fairly spectacular Highbury Plaza. We were to stay there for a week, with all expenses paid. He\u2019d booked spa appointments. We didn\u2019t even have to check in, as Lolo\u2019s \u201cpeople\u201d had seen to that.</p><p>I got a little nervous at the sight of the tall silver cylinder, one of the highest points on the city skyline. We crossed the chrome and blue glass lobby with our \u201cwell-loved\u201d bags in hand and headed straight for the elevators. The moment the doors closed, Caleb lunged, pressing me against the glass elevator wall, and ravaged my mouth. I felt his hands cup my jeans-clad butt and squeaked. \u201cIt\u2019s a glass elevator! The people in the lobby will see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let \u2019em see,\u201d he growled.</p><p>When we\u2019d reached our floor, we slid against the walls of the hallway, kissing and groping and laughing, until we finally found our room. When I unlocked the door, all kissing and/or groping stopped. This wasn\u2019t a room, this was a suite. It was the fanciest space I\u2019d seen since leaving my \u201cmarried\u201d apartment all those years ago. Even with the beige, ivory, and slate-blue tones, it was still remarkably feminine. The delicately beige carpet was plush and thick under my toes as I pranced around the room, hopping up and down over the view of the skyline and the mountains. We disheveled the hell out of the immaculately white duvet on the enormous bed, revealing the delicate blue sheets.</p><p>I dashed into the bathroom and made a squealing noise that brought an alarmed Caleb running. \u201cThere\u2019s a separate shower and a bath!\u201d I cried, climbing into the white-tiled whirlpool tub. Every square inch of the bathroom was pristine, recently cleaned white ceramic.</p><p>I was reasonably sure there would be no bugs in the tub. I wanted to bask in the cleanliness, wallow in it. I wanted to eat dinner in that tub, just because I could.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so clean.\u201d I sighed. \u201cAnd it has a separate tub and shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s scream-worthy because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause sometimes a girl wants to wash her hair in a separate space from where she washes the rest of her.\u201d</p><p>Caleb frowned. \u201cGirls are weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopelessly so,\u201d I admitted. \u201cThis seems a little too good to be true. Are you sure that Lolo\u2019s not setting us up for credit-card fraud or a body hidden in the closet or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Lolo likes to treat people well when they do right by him. If you\u2019d ever met his wife, you\u2019d understand why he was so grateful,\u201d Caleb assured me. \u201cShe\u2019s got a temper on her and doesn\u2019t care much who sees her flip out. We didn\u2019t just save Lolo\u2019s marriage. We might have saved his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe tossed a cake at Lolo\u2019s head once. Most awkward birthday party I\u2019ve ever been to.\u201d</p><p>I considered that for a moment. \u201cSo how long is that massage he booked for us?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, wrapping his arms around my waist. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to take a swim in that tub with me?\u201d I asked, kissing his chin.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll get to that eventually.\u201d He grinned down at me and lifted my hips, locking my ankles at the small of his back. He gave me one long, heated look before devouring my mouth. His hands were everywhere, cupping my face, my ass, teasing my breasts with light little touches around the nipples but never touching them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bracing my hands against the open bathroom door, I bucked against him. He ripped my shirt down the front, and my bra followed, fluttering to the floor in ruins. I rocked and rode against him, seeking the friction we both needed so much.</p><p>He managed to keep me pinned to the door, unzip his jeans, and roll on a condom without dropping my butt to the floor. He pushed gently inside me. I sighed as my body adjusted, stretching to accommodate him.</p><p>And just as I grasped his rhythm, he spun, carrying me across the room toward the bed. Loved. I\u2019d never felt so loved and cared for and wanted in my whole life. I wanted this feeling to go on and on, until I was old and gray and no longer able to pull off this position. Wherever I was going, I wanted Caleb to come with me.</p> <p>Caleb pushed my hair off my shoulder as he rained kisses down the length of my neck, down my spine, pressing his mouth to each individual star before making his way back to my shoulders. He nipped my earlobe as he pressed inside me, working our hips together as he slid his hand around my hip. I pushed back, bracing my arm against the headboard, until I was filled to the hilt. His hands were everywhere\u2014between my legs, on my breasts, at my throat.</p><p>A delicious tension wound its way out from my belly, tightening from my breasts down to my toes. Caleb rubbed in small circles, increasing his thrusts as his breath came in short bursts. I threw my head back, yelling when one final thrust of his hips sent a climax rippling along my body. Caleb pulled me up until I was sitting in his lap, my overwrought nerves twitching and firing as he moved underneath me. We collapsed against the mattress, sweaty and sated.</p><p>\u201cIf you make a joke about me bringing out the beast in you, I will not be held accountable for my actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>Honestly, we intended to honor our reservation at the steakhouse just across the street. Caleb got dressed up in a white Oxford shirt and khakis. He was tugging uncomfortably at a navy tie when I stepped out of the bathroom. He looked so polished, with his dark hair carefully combed back and the darker caramel tones of his skin highlighted by the crisp white shirt.</p> <p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d I breathed. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cDo a little twirl for me.\u201d I complied with the twirl request, the skirt of the fitted long-sleeved red dress I\u2019d chosen from the lobby shop swishing against my legs. I\u2019d put on weight since the last time I\u2019d bought clothes, which I was choosing to see as a good thing.</p><p>We meant to walk out the door and go to the restaurant. We really did. But Caleb was just beaming at me, as if I\u2019d personally hung the moon, and he really liked the way I was wearing that dress . . . and the next thing I knew, we were naked all over again.</p><p>Sometime just before the room-service kitchen was about to close, we managed to put on robes and order dinner. Knowing Caleb\u2019s appetite, I ordered big\u2014thick rare steaks, hand-cut fries, macaroni and cheese, chicken and dumplings, not to mention half of the dessert cart. It took three people to deliver our order to our room, plus the sommelier who carried the bottle of semidry red wine I\u2019d ordered. When the sommelier offered Caleb the bottle to inspect, he grinned and motioned to me. I gave it a cursory glance and nodded, smiling warmly at the man.</p><p>\u201cA lovely selection, miss,\u201d he said, snapping his heels together before pouring us each a healthy portion. He left the bottle on the cart, accepted his tip from Caleb, and closed the door behind him. I took another sip of wine, enjoying the way it rolled over my tongue.</p><p>Caleb watched, his head tilted as he studied me. \u201cYou used to have this, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy own private sommelier? Well, not every day, just on the weekends,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cNo, the nice clothes, hotels with wine lists, waiters with accents, the whole thing. You used to have this.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWell, I lived on the nice side of comfortable, I\u2019ll admit. And there are things I miss, like a dependably bug-free shower and knowing where I\u2019m going to sleep every night, but I have to say, I was a lot more comfortable eating burgers at a saloon. With you.\u201d I gave him a smacking kiss. \u201cAll this, it\u2019s nice. But I can live without it.\u201d</p><p>We ate, sitting on the floor in our robes, in front of the window, with the lights of Anchorage laid out before us. I was toying with an asparagus spear, considering the chocolate \u00e9clair left untouched on the dessert plate. It was lying there, all chocolaty and creamy and provocative. It was practically asking me to eat it.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was hoping you would come home with me,\u201d Caleb said suddenly.</p><p>The hussy \u00e9clair forgotten, I grinned at Caleb and toyed with the belt of his robe. \u201cWell, sailor, I don\u2019t think that line works if we\u2019re already home for the night, but if you want to do \u2018strangers in a bar,\u2019 I\u2019m up for it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, prying my hands loose from his belt without much enthusiasm. \u201cNo, back to the valley, which is your home, too, so it sort of works out. I wanted to ask you before, but I was afraid you\u2019d say no. I\u2019m going to be heading back in a few weeks. You could stay with me, in my house. And we could have a life together. I know Maggie would rehire you as the pack doctor. It\u2019s difficult to find doctors who can treat werewolves. I doubt she\u2019s filled the position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what happens when spring comes and you need to go out on the road again?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cYou can come with me. I work twice as fast when you\u2019re around anyway. Or hell, I could work from home. My cousin Cooper has been on me about joining his business, expanding it. I could do that, stay in one place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t ask you to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t, I\u2019m asking you. What do you want out of life?\u201d he asked. \u201c \u2019Cause you can\u2019t keep running like this. You can\u2019t just keep moving on until you\u2019re too old and tired to move on again.\u201d</p><p>Well, that sucked all of the levity out of the conversation.</p><p>I knew what I wanted. I wanted to go back to the pack. I wanted to go back to the only real home I\u2019d known since my parents died. And I wanted to stay with Caleb.</p><p>\u201cI loved living in the valley. It was an incredible gift that your family gave me, allowing me to practice medicine. It was like regaining the use of a limb. And I belonged for the first time in years. I had a family. People who valued me, looked me in the eye. I was a person again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sense a \u2018but\u2019 coming,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s such a big decision,\u201d I said weakly.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re scared.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThat would be a massive understatement, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy something I\u2019ve done?\u201d he asked, his expression faltering.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you. Trust me, it has nothing to do with you. But I believe Glenn when he says he can find me. It\u2019s only a matter of time, really. If I came home with you, I could be bringing all that trouble with me, right into your pack. And I couldn\u2019t stand it if someone in your family got hurt because of me or if he caused trouble for the pack. It\u2019s the reason I left in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he wasn\u2019t part of the equation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could kill him,\u201d Caleb offered quietly, toying with the lapels of my robe. \u201cI could track him down, snuff him out before he even saw me coming. I could make it look like an accident. It would never be traced back to you.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him for a long, silent moment. It wasn\u2019t as if I hadn\u2019t considered it. And it would be so easy to let the word yes slip from my lips, to let Caleb give Glenn all of the pain he deserved and somehow keep my hands relatively clean. All I had to do was nod, and I would have the ultimate revenge on my bastard ex-husband.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019d spent most of our time together griping at Caleb about his tendency to act without mercy. I couldn\u2019t exactly turn around and ask him to kill for me.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Caleb protested, \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I love you too much to make you a killer.\u201d</p><p>Caleb pouted. \u201cNot even a thorough maiming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then, forget your ex. Forget everything but what you want to do right now, what you know in your heart is the right thing for you. Just for you. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>I leaned my forehead against his and pressed my lips to his. \u201cI want to go home with you.\u201d</p><p>Red-burn was going to be so pissed at me when I told her I didn\u2019t need that ID after all.</p><p>Whooping, Caleb dragged me down to the floor and kissed me. He nuzzled at the place on my neck where he\u2019d bitten me all those months ago, and it tingled a bit. I pulled away, rubbing at my former hickey. Caleb noticed the gesture and pulled himself back up to a sitting position. \u201cSo you know how things work with us, right? The mating thing? The claiming bite?\u201d I nodded. \u201cWell, I hope that\u2019s something you\u2019re willing to consider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we know enough about each other to be mated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that you\u2019re strong, you\u2019re adaptable, and you\u2019re smart, all qualities that make for a fantastic mate.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I was both touched and slightly insulted that he hadn\u2019t mentioned me being at all pretty.</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t put the claiming bite on you until you\u2019ve finished your business with Glenn. Divorced, separated by church and state, lock, stock, and barrel.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open. \u201cBut that could take years.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this some sort of bizarre stall tactic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is about you getting closure before we start something new. I think it\u2019s important for you to finish this on your own terms. And frankly, I\u2019d like to put your real legal name on our marriage certificate, not an alias. That means that you can\u2019t be married to someone else when we file it. Werewolves don\u2019t file a lot of legitimate government paperwork. We take the marriage licenses pretty seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the worst proposal I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true. That honor belongs to my cousin Maggie, whose mating and proposal involved accidentally biting her mate on the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I conceded, remembering the number of stitches required to sew up Nick\u2019s butt cheek. \u201cThat was worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is important,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s something you need to do for yourself, not for me. I can be patient. You can take all the time you need.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, peering up at him through my lashes. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I thought the answer was to just keep moving around, but that hasn\u2019t worked so far. I have to change tactics. And I would feel a lot better not lying to people every time I open my mouth.\u201d</p><p>He fluttered his hand over his heart. \u201cA nonromantic response to a nonromantic proposal.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, whacking him with a pillow, wrestling with him until I pinned him to the floor and pressed a kiss against his throat. I was fairly certain he let me win. \u201cI\u2019ll start the paperwork just as soon as we get back to the valley,\u201d I promised. \u201cIf nothing else, I have to come home with you so I can see the look on Maggie\u2019s face when she realizes I might end up her in-law.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>Pandora Was a Total Idiot</p><p>We were leaving. I\u2019d never looked forward to traveling like this. Usually, departures meant distress. Now I was going home.</p><p>We would be leaving for the valley in a few days. Caleb was working diligently to close up whichever of his pending cases he could close and to send progress reports to his clients on those still open. Since I was able to type more than five angrily pecked words per minute, I ended up sending out most of them while Caleb dictated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you would give up typing for the day and get naked with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to leave town without any pesky paperwork hanging over your head?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm, my desire for sex loses out to my hatred of paperwork. Well played, woman.\u201d He sighed, hauling himself out of bed. \u201cI need to get the tires checked for our trip and run to the grocery anyway. Surprise, surprise, we\u2019re out of condoms again. And those little packs of raisins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about some juice boxes?\u201d I suggested cheekily.</p><p>\u201cWell, they might come in handy,\u201d he said, considering.</p><p>\u201cMy big bad wolf.\u201d I sighed, rolling my eyes. I kissed him again. \u201cIf people only knew.\u201d</p><p>He swatted my butt good-naturedly. \u201cYou\u2019re just happy you don\u2019t have to buy the condoms.\u201d</p><p>I pursed my lips, remembering exactly how hot my cheeks got when the clerk at the Ready-Mart gave me the I know what you\u2019ve been doing look over my box of extra-large, ribbed-for-her-pleasure protection. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d</p><p>I worked steadily for an hour, doing a little dance when I finished the last report and hit \u201cSend\u201d on the e-mail program.</p><p>All I had left to do was pack. I was really looking forward to returning to the valley. I knew I would have to do quite a bit of groveling, but eventually, the pack would accept me again.</p><p>Now for the e-mail I\u2019d put off for the last week. I opened the program to sign out of Caleb\u2019s address and sign into the secure server I used to contact Red-burn. Just as I was about to click on \u201cLog Out,\u201d a new message alert popped into a folder labeled \u201cPack\u201d with a ping. I frowned. I knew there were folders in Caleb\u2019s account\u2014heck, I\u2019d arranged most of them\u2014but I\u2019d assumed they were for storage. I didn\u2019t realize they could receive directed messages.</p><p>I opened the folder and had to search around a bit before I found a subfolder marked \u201cSchuna,\u201d bolded and blinking with an unread message. I opened it and saw that the messages were from a private investigator in Seattle named Robert Schuna, the same investigator who\u2019d sent us after a guy named Calvin Dodd. In fact, the new message was from Schuna, with the subject line \u201cProgress Report?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I didn\u2019t remember flagging his messages to go into a special folder. But now that I thought about it, I hadn\u2019t seen a new message from him in more than a week.</p><p>Frowning at the screen, I tapped my fingers on the touch pad. I thought we\u2019d handled all of Schuna\u2019s cases. In fact, I\u2019d sent him his last progress report the day before. Maybe there was a problem with the report? I opened the message.</p><p>Graham\u2014</p> <p>I need another progress report on the Bishop \u2018missing person\u2019 case. The client is getting antsy. Thank God, the guy\u2019s in Tennessee, or he\u2019d be camped out in my office, waiting for news. I\u2019d drop his twitchy ass, but he\u2019s paying me double. I\u2019m willing to up your stake by twenty percent if you would just find this woman and put us all out of our misery. Send me what you can ASAP, and I\u2019ll pass it along to him.</p><p>\u2014S.</p><p>It took me a moment to realize that the wounded, inhuman sound piercing my eardrums was coming from my mouth. Bishop case? Out of Tennessee? It couldn\u2019t be true. It couldn\u2019t be my Bishop case. There had to be some sort of funny coincidence to explain this away.</p><p>All of the blood seemed to drain from my hands, leaving them cold and shaking as I tapped at the touch pad and opened the rest of the e-mails. They started two months before, around the time Red-burn sent me the red alert. I opened the attachments and found Glenn\u2019s official \u201ccase report\u201d listing me as a runaway spouse. He\u2019d told Schuna I had a history of mental illness, substance abuse, and filing false police reports. He\u2019d been trying to get me help, he claimed, and when I found out that he was planning to have me committed to special rehab for the mentally ill, I ran. He just wanted to bring me home and get me help, he claimed.</p><p>I clicked through the attachments, finding our wedding portrait, credit reports, transcripts, lists of friends, my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and work history\u2014which was amazing, really, considering the supposed mental problems and pill addictions Glenn subtly indicated to my coworkers. The final blow was a picture of me on the beach on our second wedding anniversary. It was displayed on a flyer demanding, \u201cHave You Seen This Woman?\u201d I\u2019d always hated that picture. I was giving the camera my happy-on-the-surface smile, and I looked a little tired around the eyes, but that was to be expected when Glenn had kept me up until five that morning, accusing me of flirting with the waiter who served our anniversary dinner.</p> <p>Caleb had been hired to find me.</p><p>I stumbled into the bathroom on watery legs, collapsing in front of the commode just before I tossed the contents of my stomach. Rivers of tears poured down my cheeks as I threw up, over and over. I balanced my head against my crossed arms, sobbing and sniffling. I grabbed a washcloth, still wet from my shower, and swiped at my face. I collapsed back against the tub.</p><p>How could I have been so stupid? He\u2019d been lying to me all this time. Everything he\u2019d said and done had been a cold-blooded calculation to lead me back to Glenn. Pretending not to know my name. Pretending not to know about my connection to the pack, not to know I was a doctor. He\u2019d been pretending, training me to trust him, to let him close, like coaxing a stray cat into your house with a can of tuna. I thought I was being so smart, so guarded, and I\u2019d walked right into his trap.</p><p>How could the worst liar in the world have tricked me so thoroughly? I\u2019d slept with him! I\u2019d let him see every part of me. I\u2019d told him things I\u2019d been afraid to admit to myself.</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand why. Was the fancy hotel some sort of trick to make me feel more comfortable or an attempt to soften the blow of betraying me? Or did he just want to screw on soft sheets before giving up his favorite toy? What was his angle? Enjoy one last week with me at this hotel, then pack me up in the truck tomorrow, maybe drug me once I figured out we were driving toward Seattle? Or would he shove a bag over my head and take me to some airplane hangar in the middle of nowhere?</p><p>I felt so completely stupid. Did he have a girlfriend somewhere he was going to go home to after he tossed me to the wolves?</p> <p>Bad choice of words.</p><p>The mating. Was the mating real? Had I wanted so much to belong to someone that I let myself believe that we were connected in some spiritual, otherworldly way? Had I made up all those clingy, desperate emotions? My face flushed hot and red, tears stinging my eyes.</p><p>I\u2019d been right before. There was no such thing as magic.</p><p>He promised he wouldn\u2019t hurt me. What complete and utter bullshit. I wasn\u2019t his mate. He never loved me. He was probably laughing at me this whole time, humoring me as he coaxed me into trusting him. Why hadn\u2019t I questioned that? Why didn\u2019t I pay attention to all of those alarms going off in my head?</p><p>I had to run. There was no other way. I had to get on the road before Caleb figured out what was going on. He\u2019d made it clear where his loyalties were: his wallet. I could only imagine the kind of money Glenn had offered him. It would be better if I could catch a ride with the next semi I saw. I could get maybe an hour or two head start if his errands took long enough. I could hitch a ride from the tavern down the street, or maybe some of the hotel staff would be willing to help.</p><p>I packed as calmly as I could with my heart and mind racing. I took all of my clothes, except the red dress. I crumpled that up in a ball and threw it into a corner. I surveyed Caleb\u2019s cache of tools and took some plastic restraints and pepper spray. You never knew what sort of trouble you could get into while traveling. Frowning at what seemed like a trifling amount of protection in my shoulder bag, I also took the collapsible baton. I\u2019d come to think of it as mine, anyway.</p><p>And on one last impulse, I grabbed his Taser.</p><p>I would need cash. Caleb had socked away a good portion of our earnings in the hotel-room safe. He\u2019d used my fast-approaching birthday as the combination. The thought of stealing from him . . . well, it didn\u2019t bother me a whole lot, at the moment.</p> <p>I dropped my bags near the closet door and was about to kneel in front of the safe when I heard the electronic lock click on the hallway door. I froze.</p><p>Caleb was back already!</p><p>How the hell did he get his tires inspected that fast? I glanced at the clock. He\u2019d been gone for almost three hours. Apparently, I\u2019d spent more time in the bathroom having a mental breakdown than I\u2019d realized.</p><p>The thought of him walking through the front door, all smiles, made me want to swing that horribly heavy hotel steam iron at his face. But that would probably tip him off that I was angry. Right. I could act my way through this. I\u2019d faked orgasms that made Glenn think he was some sort of sexual wunderkind. I could play the loving, stupid, unassuming, naive, deceived, imbecilic\u2014</p><p>Rein it in, Campbell, I told myself as the door opened. You can play the loving girlfriend for the next few minutes. Just get him to leave the room, and you\u2019re gone.</p><p>I straightened, kicked my bags into the closet, and shrugged into one of Caleb\u2019s shirts as if I\u2019d just been slipping into it when he returned. Not pilfering his weaponry and contemplating his demise via steam iron.</p><p>His sunny smile tore my heart like wet paper. I forced the muscles of my face into a pleasant expression.</p><p>\u201cTook you a while,\u201d I said as he dropped his grocery bag and strode across the room toward me. He wrapped his arm around my waist and nudged the closet door with his foot just so he could shove me against it.</p><p>\u201cI missed you,\u201d he rumbled, pressing my hips against the straining zipper of his jeans to show me just how much he missed me. A rush of longing crashed through me, taking my breath. He was breaking my heart. Even now, I could feel the cracks rippling across the surface.</p><p>I cupped my hand around his cheek. As much as I wanted to hate him\u2014and I would\u2014I was going to miss him so much.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d he asked, dragging a thumb down my cheek. \u201cYour eyes are all red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, my voice a little wobbly. I sucked in a breath to steady it. \u201cI\u2019ve been staring at the computer screen too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I need a shower. That garage reeked, and I feel like it soaked into my skin. You could join me,\u201d he suggested, grinning at me. \u201cIn the interest of water conservation and all.\u201d</p><p>I kissed him, long and deep, drawing it out so that I would remember the feel of his deceitful, shameless lips on mine for the rest of my life. It took everything I had not to bite down and draw blood, to cause just a fraction of the pain he was causing me. I smiled up at him, trying not to wince at the distinct cracking sensation in my chest. \u201cOK, you go get the water warmed up. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me right between the eyebrows and dropped me gently onto the bed. \u201cWill do!\u201d</p><p>He walked across the room, whistling as he dropped his clothes. I let my head fall back on the mattress. Get up, I told myself, pushing myself off of the bed. Get out the door. Break down later.</p><p>The moment I heard the shower run, I moved back across the room to the closet.</p><p>Listening for the sound of water, I quietly slid the closet door open and tapped the combination into the safe\u2019s keypad. I winced as each keystroke produced a loud, whining beep. I hoped his werewolf ears wouldn\u2019t pick that up.</p><p>My eyes slid across the laptop, still open on the desk. I knew it would be so much smarter to delete the e-mail, to give me that much more time as Schuna and Caleb straightened out their miscommunications. But I wanted Caleb to know why I left. I didn\u2019t want him to have any doubts.</p><p>Eventually, he\u2019d look at the screen, realize what happened, and start tracking me. But before that, I wanted him to realize that I knew what a lying, lowlife asshole he was.</p><p>Stop it. You\u2019re wasting time. Get your ass out that door and on the road.</p><p>I yanked the safe door open, finding a respectable stash of twenties bundled into five-hundred-dollar stacks. I calculated my percentage of Caleb\u2019s stash and tucked eight hundred dollars into my pocket.</p><p>I pushed myself to my feet and slung the bag over my shoulders. After casting one last glance at the steamy bathroom, I shook my head and made for the door. I had my hand on the door handle when I felt long, wet fingers snap around my wrist.</p><p>Caleb was standing behind me, dripping wet, with no towel in sight. His expression was hurt and confused as he looked me up and down, spotting the bags, the jacket, all the signs that I was bolting.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>I had a hundred responses tumbling around in my head.</p><p>Just going to get some ice, honey.</p><p>I\u2019m going down to the lobby for some Tylenol.</p><p>I\u2019m blowing this Popsicle stand, you lying sociopathic werewolf dick.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t seem to produce the words. They seemed to be building up in my throat, threatening to choke me if they poured out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cTina, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I was practically hyperventilating. All the moments we\u2019d shared, the laughs, the mishaps, every kiss and touch, spun through my head on fast-forward. And rage, white-hot and all-consuming, bubbled up from my belly. I yanked my hand out of his grasp, raised my foot high, and stomped his sensitive instep. Caleb yowled, letting go of my wrist as he hopped away on his good foot.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do that for?\u201d he demanded, but by that time, my hand had snaked into my bag and charged the Taser. I clicked the control, swung my arm up, and pressed the prongs to his skin. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, I fired it, sending canned lightning straight into Caleb\u2019s chest.</p><p>Unfortunately, I hadn\u2019t considered how the water covering Caleb\u2019s skin would carry the current, and he ended up twitching on the carpet in full-body shock. He shouted for just a second before his jaw muscles locked up. The charge ended, and Caleb looked up at me, eyes wide and golden in their distress. \u201cIf this is some sort of kinky \u2018naughty cat burglar\u2019 role-playing game, I am not getting it,\u201d he said, panting.</p><p>I grunted and gave him another shot, just on principle. This could be considered a breakup, right? Nothing says I\u2019m just not that into you like Taser fire.</p><p>\u201cS-stop T-t-tasering me!\u201d he shouted, sounding more annoyed than injured. For a millisecond, I felt a little guilty. There\u2019s nothing more pathetic than a wet, naked guy flopping all over a hotel carpet while being electrocuted. And then the laptop caught my eye, and I got pissed off all over again. I dropped the Taser into my bag. He sat up, gingerly pressing at the already-healing contact burns on his chest. \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead your e-mail,\u201d I snarled. Caleb caught my arm, dragging me down to the carpet next to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>I shrugged him off and tried to stand up, only to have him grab my arm again and stop me. \u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talking about, you asshole!\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think sorry is going to cover what you did?\u201d I hissed, finally managing to push to my feet.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry about this.\u201d With speed you wouldn\u2019t expect from a guy who\u2019d been recently Tasered, he swiped his leg out, knocking my feet out from under me. I flopped onto the carpet next to him with a startled uuhf!</p><p>My only excuse was that, as with a lot of things about Caleb, I just didn\u2019t see it coming.</p><p>He groaned, pulling my arm away from his face, where it had apparently flopped with quite a bit of force as I fell. As petty as it was, that made me feel a little bit better.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I kicked you,\u201d he said solemnly, working his jaw to loosen the abused muscles. \u201cBut considering the Taser, I think we\u2019re even. Now, will you please tell me what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who I am,\u201d I told him, scooting across the floor to brace my back against the closet door.</p><p>\u201cOf course I know who you are!\u201d he cried, rolling toward me. \u201cYou told me all about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something about the way the lie rolled off his tongue so easily had me reaching into my bag again. He snatched the bag out of my hands and threw it toward the hallway door. I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sit there and pretend that you haven\u2019t known exactly who I am from the minute we met? I saw the e-mails from Schuna, Caleb! I know you\u2019ve been working on the \u2018Bishop case\u2019 for months.\u201d</p><p>All of the color drained from Caleb\u2019s cheeks, leaving a waxy werewolf scrambling across the floor to kneel in front of me. \u201cTina, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it all a trick?\u201d I asked, my voice cracking. \u201cDid you really get into a fight with that Marty guy in the parking lot, or was that a setup to get my sympathy? Tell me you didn\u2019t blow up my car for no good reason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTina\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted you, you sonofabitch! And I don\u2019t trust anyone. You promised me, no more surprises. And this is a hell of a surprise. You lied to me. Every time you opened your mouth and didn\u2019t tell me what you were really up to, you lied to me. I mean, I get that you\u2019re just trying to do a job, that I was an assignment. And after seeing you work, I can respect that it\u2019s not anything personal. But why pretend you didn\u2019t know me? Why didn\u2019t you just tell me Schuna was hiring you to find me? Why pretend you liked me? How could you lie like that? Why not just gag me and toss me into the back of the truck like you do everybody else? It\u2019s not like you didn\u2019t have the chance. I couldn\u2019t exactly overpower you. You let me think . . . how could you let me think that I found . . . just how the hell could you?\u201d</p><p>My rant done, I sagged against the door, all of the wind knocked out of me. I hated the tears coursing down my cheeks, hated showing the slightest hint of how much he\u2019d hurt me. But at least I wasn\u2019t throwing up on him. I considered that a small personal victory.</p><p>His dark eyes flickered down toward my bags. \u201cSo you were just going to leave without saying anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted a head start,\u201d I told him. When his jaw dropped, I added, \u201cYou\u2019ve made it pretty clear you don\u2019t care who you\u2019re tracking as long as you get paid. You don\u2019t care what they did or who\u2019s after them\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is different!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just is. I can\u2019t believe you thought I would just hand you over!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to try to pull the indignant card right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what you mean to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t really know what I mean to you. Everything you\u2019ve told me is a lie. I can thank you, at least, for never saying you love me. You have at least that much shame.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you I love you in about a dozen ways. But believe me, if I said the words, you\u2019d bolt.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his hands away when he tried to touch my cheeks. \u201cBelieve you?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve proved yourself so trustworthy, right? You didn\u2019t even admit you were a werewolf until you had no choice. Oh, my God, is that it? Is that why you kept me around? I figured out that you were a werewolf, and you wanted to make sure I wouldn\u2019t tell anybody? You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, stop it. Stop! Look, Schuna hadn\u2019t told me anything personal about you.\u201d He tried to reach for me again but thought better of it when I unleashed a growl so vicious it rivaled his own on his wolfiest day. \u201cYou were an assignment, just like all of my other assignments. When I got your paperwork, I had no idea you were the sweet little pack doctor my cousins had been going on about. I didn\u2019t figure that out until you told me. You were just some runaway housewife with a drug problem and a worried husband at home. Schuna said his client just wanted to know where you were, that you were safe. I was supposed to send him the location and then wait for instructions. But you weren\u2019t a priority case. I wasn\u2019t even following your trail. I was still looking for Jerry when I came across that beautiful \u2018home\u2019 smell. I followed it for days, wandering around that armpit of a town. I saw you working at the grocery store. I did recognize you as Tina Campbell, and I realized the two women I was tracking were one and the same. From that moment on, your case was closed. I couldn\u2019t take someone in when she smelled like my pack. I wanted to approach you, to ask how a little human like you could be connected to my pack. But I told myself, \u2018Not tonight. Just hold on for a while. Watch her.\u2019</p><p>\u201cAnd I watched. I saw that the story Schuna fed me was total bullshit. I saw how sweet you were to everybody who crossed your path, even though it was so obvious that you were exhausted and scared and barely hanging on. I saw you smile . . . and that was it for me. You were it for me. I figured whatever was really going on with your husband, I could find a way to help you. I\u2019d finally worked up the nerve to talk to you, which was why I was waiting in the parking lot for you\u2014which I will admit sounds a little creepy, now that I\u2019ve said it out loud. Anyway, I was waiting for you, and that\u2019s when Marty showed up, and the whole thing just sort of snowballed.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, obviously hoping to see some softening of my expression. He winced when he saw me glowering at him. \u201cAnd that convoluted, slightly insane story explains why you continued to lie to me, how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how the hell was I supposed to come out with all that without it sounding convoluted and slightly insane? You were already so skittish I was afraid you were going to bolt at any minute. Then you found my tool kit in the truck, and you did try to bolt. I\u2019m so sorry I lied, but by the time I thought you might trust me, it was too late for confessions. I knew you\u2019d be so angry that there would be no getting past it. I just wanted to get you back to the valley before I confessed everything,\u201d he said, as if he could tell the last few words out of his mouth were not the words of a reasonable, intelligent werewolf.</p><p>\u201cWhere I would be trapped for the winter and couldn\u2019t get away.\u201d</p><p>He pulled a face that looked remarkably like a wince. \u201c \u2018Trapped\u2019 is such an ugly word.\u201d</p> <p>I glowered at him. \u201cI can think of a few more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I put some pants on so we can discuss this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worried about being naked? Isn\u2019t that a werewolf\u2019s favorite outfit?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, glancing down. \u201cI feel all vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and waved toward the bathroom. He bounded up from the floor, having recovered from his Tasering in record time, and threw on some sweats. He offered me his hand, to help me off the floor. I glared up at him.</p><p>He sighed and dropped to the carpet next to me. \u201cI\u2019ve kept us moving just in case Schuna sent another investigator after you. And I\u2019ve been feeding him fake progress reports. I told him you were spotted boarding a plane from Anchorage to Ontario. And then I told him you\u2019d taken the ferry back to Washington State. Anything to keep him off your trail. We took off after Trixie because Schuna told me he was going to send a second investigator to Fairbanks to help out. I had to get you out of town. Suds is stalling him, telling him that I\u2019m working on another case. By the time we got back to the valley, we\u2019d be snowed in, and we\u2019d have time to figure out something long-term. I\u2019ve been trying to help you, Tina, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not working, because Glenn is still driving Schuna nuts with requests for follow-up reports. So, short of killing you or faking my death, this plan is a failure.\u201d He opened his mouth, as if he was about to propose something, and I cut him off. \u201cI am not faking my own death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask why I would have to be killed in this scenario.\u201d</p><p>I ignored that, because I thought the answer was apparent. \u201cI really don\u2019t know where to go from here,\u201d I told him. \u201cEverything about us is just one layer of lies after another. We\u2019re a lasagna of lies. This is a terrible basis for a relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re it for me,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s always been you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be loved just because I smell right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do smell fantastic. And I do love you,\u201d he promised me. \u201cNot because you smell right. I love you because you\u2019re funny and smart, and you don\u2019t know the meaning of the word \u2018quit.\u2019 \u2018Common sense\u2019 and \u2018self-preservation\u2019 are also terms I would like you to look up. I love you because you\u2019re stubborn and insanely smart and willing to get into fistfights with strippers to help someone out. I love you because you\u2019re so much stronger than you think you are. I love that you can only eat waffles if there is an equal amount of butter and syrup in each square. I love the way you can only sleep if you have a toe sticking out from under the blanket. I hate that you feel like you can\u2019t trust me, but I understand that I\u2019m the one who made you feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s awfully generous of you,\u201d I grumbled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything you would like to say to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that you would want to hear,\u201d I retorted. I hated the hurt expression that crossed his face, but I wasn\u2019t willing to try to make Caleb feel better or tell him that I loved him. Wanting to hurt him in some way felt like a reasonable thing.</p><p>Caleb reached up to touch my shoulder. I moved away, which seemed to deflate him. He slumped against the side of the bed. \u201cSo what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need time to think,\u201d I told him. \u201cI have a whole other life set up for me. I\u2019m not sure where. That\u2019s why I had to come to Anchorage, to get the papers and money I needed to get started.\u201d</p><p>If it was possible, Caleb went even paler. \u201cTina, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m definitely going to take it. I just need some time to think about everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lies. My lies. Glenn. The werewolf factor. Everything. I can only deal with so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d He nodded slowly and got to his feet. I stood, wanting to keep us on the same level. He turned to the closet and threw on a shirt. I watched as he moved around the room, collecting his laptop, toiletries, and clothes. It only took him a few minutes.</p><p>A strange sense of desperation came over me as he slid into his coat. Don\u2019t let him go, you idiot! a little voice in my head commanded. Stop him. Go with him. Something! Don\u2019t just stand there! Instead, I stood stone-faced by the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to the valley,\u201d he said. \u201cYou stay here in this hotel under your assumed name for the next week. When no one shows up looking for you in that time, you\u2019ll know that I\u2019m on your side. When no one shows up, I will find a way to get you back to the valley. Hell, Suds will probably come pick you up. I\u2019d rather it be me, but I figure that would interfere with your \u2018space\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>I nodded slowly. It was a fair plan. It gave me an out. But that didn\u2019t mean I was happy to see him leave. He went to the safe to retrieve the cash. He counted out a large stack of twenty-dollar bills and put them on the dresser.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need cash,\u201d he reminded me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that because I already took eight hundred from the stash.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows winged up, and despite the exceedingly crappy situation, I could see the barest hint of a smile quirk the corners of his mouth. \u201cWell, keep that, too. You\u2019ll need it.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cIf you decide . . . not to join me, will you stay in Alaska?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I should tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you run again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call it running,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>Caleb shifted from one foot to the other. \u201cEither way, I\u2019m going to send Schuna a report stating that I\u2019ve come to a dead end with your case. No more leads. No more information to follow. It\u2019s not the first time things haven\u2019t panned out on a case. It won\u2019t make him suspicious.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>He moved closer and bent his head to kiss me. I stepped away, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I told him, even when my eyes burned and I couldn\u2019t seem to draw a full breath. I stared down at the carpet, unable to look at him.</p><p>Without another word, he walked out the door.</p><p>For hours, I sat on the bed, staring at the door, sure that Caleb was going to walk right back through it. And I wasn\u2019t sure whether that would be a good thing or not. I flip-flopped on whether to grab my bags and run for the Canadian border. Finally, I pulled all of my belongings together, went downstairs, and rented a new, more reasonably priced room under \u201cAnna Moder\u201d and created a little rabbit den there. I spent the first day curled in the fetal position under the covers, trying to alleviate the ache in my chest. There was a diner next door to the hotel, and I abused its delivery policy terribly, eating huge amounts of room service. I watched movies on HBO until I could no longer stand the sight of Zac Efron. (It didn\u2019t take long.) And I took daily pregnancy tests, all of which were negative.</p><p>I didn\u2019t stray far from home base. When I decided it was time for professional follicle intervention, I went to the salon on the ground floor of the hotel, where the poor stylists clucked over the damage I\u2019d done over the years with repeated dye jobs. I got a deep-conditioning treatment and new, sassy layers while my toes were painted a frosty cotton-candy pink. I went to the hotel boutique and shopped for clothes that (1) weren\u2019t secondhand and (2) weren\u2019t ordered over the Internet, which was a novelty. I wore makeup\u2014real cosmetics, not just flavored ChapStick\u2014for the first time in years.</p><p>I will admit, I indulged. I dropped my guard and made silly, selfish decisions. I knew I needed to move beyond my physical needs and constant fretting over the immediate future. I had to look at the big picture. I was stalling like hell from picking up Red-burn\u2019s packet. It was the polar opposite of self-preservation, but I needed this time to process thoughts such as Caleb, you jackassed, half-wit jerk-face, I would dearly love to tap-dance on your testicles. I needed some control over my life. I needed to find my footing and make choices based on preference instead of panic. For so long, I\u2019d based my clothes, my meals, my appearance, on what was available to me. It took some field testing before I remembered how I preferred my jeans cut or which kind of lip gloss I liked best. (Skinny jeans and a violet-pink shade ironically called \u201cLupine.\u201d) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least I looked good while I stalled.</p><p>Every morning, I would wake up, pack my bags, and practically sprint to the lobby.</p><p>I would hitch my bag over my shoulder, prepared to make a blind run to the post office to pick up Red-burn\u2019s package. I could feel the cold fingers of outside air tracing the lines of my cheeks. And instead of walking out into the cold, somehow, my feet changed direction, and I was standing at the bank of elevators, ready to go back upstairs. And every morning, the staff would look at me with increasingly alarmed expressions.</p> <p>I was angry with Caleb. There was no question about it. But I\u2019d lied to him, pretending to know he wasn\u2019t lying to me, while he lied to me, pretending he didn\u2019t know I was lying to him. Neither of us was the picture of healthy communication.</p><p>In my minibar-buffeted den, I mulled my options over and over. Run back to the valley, or start another new life, or go back to Tennessee and straighten out the mess I\u2019d made of my old one. The last was more of a not-even-the-least-bit-likely palate cleanser.</p><p>A tiny, twisted part of my brain kept telling me I was damaged, messed up in the head. I couldn\u2019t even cross a parking lot without having a panic attack. Werewolves needed fierce mates who could stand up to the strange, violent pressures of their world. I would fold under the first test. I knew that pack mating rules seemed unquestionable. But maybe whatever magic governed them would make an exception, since Caleb hadn\u2019t gotten me pregnant. Maybe he could go on to have babies with some nice girl from another pack, a girl who didn\u2019t have night terrors and trust issues. And yet the very idea made my blood boil.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want him marrying some other woman. I didn\u2019t want her touching him, helping him with cases. Caleb was mine.</p><p>Now I just had to figure out how to go about talking to him again without Tasering him.</p> <p>On the sixth day of my self-imposed Howard Hughes retreat, Red-burn resolved my quandary with a phone call.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about your new ID? My connection worked really hard to make sure your picture came out nice. And I picked your name myself. I always thought you sounded like a Bethel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour new ID. Haven\u2019t you picked it up yet? Honey, I sent it a week ago, three-day guaranteed delivery. I thought you hadn\u2019t called because you were on the move. Or because you were pissed because your new first name is Bethel. But that doesn\u2019t matter, because right now, there\u2019s an animal clinic in Ottawa waiting for you to take over a vet-tech position.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly, given the amount of time I\u2019d spent working with both wolf and human anatomy, I was probably qualified for this position. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to pick it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou hassled me for weeks for that ID, and all of a sudden, you don\u2019t have time to pick it up? You sound all weird and distracted . . . wait, is there a man in this picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>Red-burn snorted. \u201cHoney, either he is or he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI have the chance to build a good life with someone. A life I could live as myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. What\u2019s stopping you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis insane roller coaster of a life I live?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cNot good enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the first couple of months we knew each other, I lied to him about who I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the domestic version of witness protection. You get a pass. Not good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lied to me about who he was. And he was a bounty hunter hired by my ex to find me.\u201d</p><p>There was a heavy pause on the other end of the line. \u201cOK . . . that would be an obstacle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I hear glasses clinking?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making myself a drink. You do the same, and we\u2019ll talk this out.\u201d</p><p>I cracked open a tiny bottle of vodka from the minibar and tossed the contents down my throat in one shot.</p><p>I hissed loudly, making her snicker on the other end of the line. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mix that with anything, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered hoarsely.</p><p>The whole sordid tale poured forth from my mouth in one long run-on sentence. How I met Caleb in the parking lot and helped him through a gunshot wound. (I left out the spontaneous healing.) How we\u2019d bounced around the state fighting crime, sort of. How I\u2019d slowly, almost against my will, fallen in love with him. And finally, how having above-average Internet-surfing skills led to Schuna\u2019s e-mail and the Tasering of a lifetime. I don\u2019t think I used so much as a comma.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . damn,\u201d she marveled, stretching the word into two syllables.</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, bottom line. If you were never to see this guy again, I mean, no calls. No Facebook stalking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the last person on earth without a Facebook page.\u201d</p><p>She continued as if she hadn\u2019t heard me. \u201cNo lying in bed half-drunk on merlot, listening to Adele and smelling one of the T-shirts you stole from him. You would never see the barest hint of his existence on this earth. How would you feel?\u201d</p><p>I felt like throwing up. Despite the whole brain-melting-anger issue, the thought of never seeing Caleb again was terrifying.</p><p>\u201cHaving trouble breathing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I wheezed.</p><p>\u201cHoney, my husband annoys and amazes me on a daily basis. He may piss me off, but the thought of never seeing him again chokes me up like you wouldn\u2019t believe. In the words of the immortal Cher, I love him awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I didn\u2019t know what you were talking about,\u201d I groaned. \u201cBoth the emotional level and the Cher reference. Who quotes Moonstruck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppreciate the classics, whippersnapper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d I sighed.</p><p>\u201cSo do you know what you\u2019re going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cDecisions made in haste usually suck. Take your sweet-ass time making your choice, so you know you\u2019ve made the right one.\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>The Colorful and Creative Threats of the Alpha Female</p><p>I took my sweet-ass time to make a decision.</p><p>I picked up the phone to call Caleb and then hung up. I highlighted the best route to the valley and then traced another route to the vet clinic. And then I crumpled the map into a ball and tossed it. I couldn\u2019t seem to force myself to take those first steps toward my new life. I was so angry with Caleb. Yes, I\u2019d lied to him, but not to hurt him or trick him. I\u2019d lied to protect myself. He\u2019d known who I was all along. He knew that Glenn was looking for me. And he didn\u2019t tell me that he was being paid to find me. I couldn\u2019t trust anything he told me. I couldn\u2019t believe him when he talked about loving me, wanting me for the rest of my life. I\u2019d heard those words before, and they\u2019d turned into shackles, keeping me tied to a man who wanted to make all of my decisions for me. I wouldn\u2019t go through it again.</p><p>Could I believe Caleb when he said he\u2019d meant no harm? As progressive as the valley pack could be, female alpha and all, Caleb had grown up in a world where the protective, dominant male instinct was not only accepted but expected. Male wolves were expected to take care of their families by any macho, bone-headed means necessary. Whether that meant throwing themselves face-first into danger or leaving out a crap load of key details, male werewolves wouldn\u2019t hesitate as long as they thought their actions would keep their mate safe. While female weres could throw down with the best of them, they tended to be a bit more crafty and manipulative. They were more likely to use sex appeal or casseroles to get what they wanted, or sometimes both simultaneously.</p><p>More to the point, Caleb had seemed so sincere when he\u2019d given me his reasons for lying. He\u2019d left me at the hotel with the resources to run. If he was only interested in selling me out for money, he could have hog-tied me like Jerry and handed me over to Schuna as soon as I figured out his connection to Glenn.</p><p>I had to admit, the life he was offering me wasn\u2019t without its charms. I would be able to return to the valley, the place I\u2019d felt at home in for so long. After a lot of explaining and groveling, I would be accepted back into the pack, the people who had become like family to me.</p><p>And yes, I would spend my life with a certain brown-eyed werewolf who made me feel safe and wanted and made my eyelids flutter like window shades. Somewhere in the darkest, deepest recesses of an extremely stubborn and pissed-off soul, I knew I missed Caleb. There were times I missed him so much that I had to curl under the covers and wrap myself around the aching, hollow feeling that spread from my chest.</p><p>I tried to write it off as mating magic or readjusting to living alone after getting used to a warm, solid body next to me in bed every night, but I missed the man for himself. I missed his wry humor and the way he made me laugh. I missed the dozens of thoughtful little things he did throughout the day to try to take care of me, even if it meant annoying me. I missed feeling warm and protected and cared for when I fell asleep tucked under his arm. I even missed his lousy my woman done me wrong, stole my truck, and gave my dog fleas country music.</p><p>Sometime during my fifth attempt to escape the lobby, I\u2019d come to the conclusion that I was, in fact, in love with the moron . . . which was inconvenient.</p><p>I loved Caleb. I loved his kindness and his generosity, which was becoming harder and harder to reconcile with the informational shell game he\u2019d played with me. How could he lie to me for so long? Why hadn\u2019t he just come out that first day after the shooting and told me, Just so you know, I\u2019ve been hired by your skeevy ex-husband to track you down and drag you back to him, but I think you\u2019re my mate, so I\u2019m just going to keep taking his per diem and keep you for myself. More French toast?</p><p>OK, maybe that would have been pushing it. But surely, as we got to know each other, he could have let some hints slip gradually.</p><p>And then, of course, I probably would have Tasered him and run like hell.</p><p>That was beside the point.</p><p>Tasers aside, how had he expected me to respond? Was I just supposed to accept this dishonesty from someone who was supposed to love me? Was I supposed to pat him on the head and tell him I understood?</p><p>I bought a cheap, reliable truck with new snow tires at a cash-only used-car lot. Traveling with Caleb had given me a confidence I\u2019d lacked on my first trip to the valley. I could take care of myself. I had taken care of myself. And I was careful to keep my baton in Caleb\u2019s special coat pocket, its heavy weight giving me a bit of swagger when I stopped to gas up the truck or grab a bite to eat.</p><p>It took four days of driving in pretty questionable weather for me to reach Grundy. I beat a respectable snowstorm by a matter of hours and had to stay at the Evergreen Motel overnight to wait for the weather to pass. I prayed in earnest that it was the last motel I had to avail myself of for quite some time.</p><p>The road to the valley had been temporarily blocked by a rockslide on the highway pass. I had to promise Leonard Tremblay discreet, no-questions-asked treatment of certain social maladies in return for a snowmobile ride there. Cooper offered to take me, but Mo was suffering from some insanely intense morning sickness, and I couldn\u2019t, in good conscience, ask him to leave his mate\u2019s side. Nor did I have the heart to tell him that in all of the werewolf pregnancies I\u2019d seen, that level of nausea indicated more than one baby. Possibly three.</p><p>After examining Mo and prescribing some ginger tea and extra-strength iron supplements, I hopped onto the back of Leonard\u2019s souped-up, blue-and-purple-flame-emblazoned snowmobile and promised fealty to whatever deity I could think of if I didn\u2019t slide off the back. The valley was a winding two-hour ride away. I spent most of it clinging to Leonard like a koala and desperately pinning my scarf against my face to block the freezing wind. Even with temperatures hovering just above zero degrees, this weather was mild compared with what we could expect in the coming months.</p><p>Still, it was a great ride. With the snow nipping at our faces and the scenery flying by, I couldn\u2019t help but grin like a little kid.</p><p>We approached the upper ridge of the valley, where we found Maggie\u2019s mate, Nick Thatcher, sitting in a little burrow he\u2019d dug out at the base of a large pine and scribbling into a notebook. Blond, bespectacled Nick could see the entire village from his vantage point, including Maggie\u2019s office at the community center. An avid climber, Nick, I knew, would have preferred to do his scribbling from a tree limb overhead, but Maggie had made her stance on snow-covered-tree climbing pretty clear when he had fallen out of that very tree the previous winter and broken his collarbone. As I\u2019d set the delicate winglike bone, Maggie had bounced between fussing and fretting over his pain and threatening to break several of his other appendages \u201cto match.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s cap-covered head snapped up at the sound of the snowmobile\u2019s engine. Residents of the valley were protective of its borders, and the nonwolf residents knew to alert the pack about any unexpected visitors. But when he recognized Leonard\u2019s blue-and-purple flame motif, his even white teeth showed through the golden-blond stubble on his face.</p><p>\u201cLen!\u201d he called as Leonard killed the engine. \u201cWhat\u2019s the news in Grundy? Have you seen Mo lately? How\u2019s she feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot a special delivery for you, Doc,\u201d Leonard shot back.</p><p>I snorted. Nick\u2019s PhD was a bit of a stumper for the locals, as they thought they were getting a new MD when he showed up at the Blue Glacier two years before. Even now, I\u2019m not sure our neighbors fully understood the difference between Nick\u2019s various anthropology and folk-studies degrees and my time in medical school. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick whooped when I pulled the scarf from my head. \u201cHey, Anna!\u201d He jumped up from his burrow to throw his arms around me. Halfway through his enthusiastic hug, he seemed to remember that I hadn\u2019t welcomed this sort of casual snuggling during my time in the valley. Before he could retreat, I gave him a little squeeze, making those baby-blue eyes of his crinkle with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re back. When you took off like that, you scared a lot of people. Are you OK? Was there some sort of emergency? Maggie\u2019s been beside herself.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure she has.\u201d</p> <p>Nick\u2019s lips quirked. \u201cNo, really, Anna, she\u2019s\u2014well, I don\u2019t want to interfere in pack business. But you need to stop by her office and talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, just as soon as I\u2014\u201d I stopped myself, suddenly reluctant to talk about Caleb, just in case he hadn\u2019t returned to the valley after all. \u201cSettle in.\u201d</p><p>I saw a faint wince flicker across Nick\u2019s features. \u201cYeah . . . you need to go see Maggie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was cryptic and unhelpful. Thank you, Dr. Thatcher,\u201d I told him. \u201cAre you coming with me into town?\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head vehemently. \u201cI\u2019ll stay here, where it\u2019s safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d I told him, making him laugh.</p><p>Leonard and I slid into town with a flourish in front of the clinic. I never thought I\u2019d be so happy to see a collection of weather-beaten buildings in the middle of nowhere. But I was practically giddy as Leonard untied my bags from the back of the snowmobile. I handed him his cabbie fee (a prescription to treat several different rashes) and called out my thanks before I jogged down the main drag through the village. Leonard waved me off and started the journey back to Grundy, where he could proudly boast to the local ladies that he was disease-free (for now).</p><p>I searched for any sign of Caleb on the street, but I couldn\u2019t even spot his truck. Mixed in among the more weather-beaten houses were newer homes, constructed over the summer after a smaller pack merged into Maggie\u2019s group. There were too many families and not enough housing. Now that the neat little one-story homes were finished, the pack had invested some money in renovating the older buildings, including the community center and the clinic.</p><p>Nick had funded the expansion out of his own pocket. Maggie and most of the pack had objected, but he ignored them. You would never have guessed it from his \u201cnerd armor,\u201d but Nick was loaded from his involvement in developing Guild of Dominion, an online role-playing game to which he contributed character designs and story lines from his extensive mythological studies. He was pretty unpretentious about the money. In fact, I was pretty sure he had T-shirts that were older than some of my patients. But when he could put his extensive funds toward something good, it made him happy, which was the mark of a good man first, rich man second, in my book.</p><p>As the alpha-slash-mayor-slash-sheriff of the village, Maggie kept an office in the large all-purpose building that served as the community center. I made my way down the street, running over the speech I\u2019d prepared in my head. Maggie had always been a bit of a puzzle for me. She was among the younger wolves of the pack, but others followed her without question. She was a good person but about as cuddly as sandpaper, preferring hunting and fighting for the pack to the more maternal roles embraced by the other females. She didn\u2019t have time or patience for bullshit, which I respected. Ultimately, she was going to be wicked pissed at me for leaving without notice, but she would know it would be easier to take me back than to try to initiate a new doctor into the ways of the pack.</p><p>So I had a little bit of clout on my side . . . but that didn\u2019t make me feel any better when I walked through the front door and found Maggie frowning over the village checkbook.</p> <p>She looked up, and rather than looking surprised or angry, her face went completely wooden. I swallowed a little lead weight in my throat. A calm Maggie was a truly scary Maggie.</p><p>\u201cI heard you might be showing up,\u201d she said, the corners of her mouth tugging southward.</p><p>I offered a nervous little smile. \u201cI heard something about a medical position being available at your village clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally, I would tell you to go screw yourself,\u201d she said sternly, glaring at me over the top of her checkbook. \u201cBut I happen to need a doctor, and you\u2019re less irritating than most of the medical people I know.\u201d Before I could respond, Maggie stood and pulled her flannel shirt away from her compact frame to reveal a small but definite swelling of her abdomen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant,\u201d I said, my mouth hanging open a little.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to see your fancy degree isn\u2019t wasted,\u201d she deadpanned.</p><p>I held her jacket open to get a better look, gratified when she didn\u2019t swat my hands away. \u201cHow many weeks?\u201d</p><p>She smirked at me. \u201cIsn\u2019t it your job to figure that out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome to the clinic in an hour, and we\u2019ll do an exam. I need to go home, get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be a problem. Tom and his family are living in your house now.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell completely open this time. \u201cYou gave away my house?\u201d</p><p>Maggie threw up her hands. \u201cWe\u2019re still in a bit of a housing crunch. The only reason we kept Caleb\u2019s dad\u2019s house open was that we knew Caleb was coming back this winter. We couldn\u2019t just wait around for you to decide you were coming back. Tom\u2019s family needed the space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, so I\u2019ll be sleeping in the clinic, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that will be necessary. You can stay with Caleb,\u201d she said in her no-nonsense voice. \u201cOnce you bat those baby blues at him and he forgives you way too easily.\u201d Well, I\u2019d never expected Maggie to take my side in the argument.</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cI owe you an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right you do.\u201d Maggie frowned. \u201cAnna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tina,\u201d I reminded her, my tone apologetic and glum.</p><p>She blanched a little. \u201cWell, that will take some getting used to. Tina, we\u2019ve always known you\u2019d had some trouble in your life before the valley. People with expensive educations don\u2019t take on the Dr. Moder job, isolating themselves out in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of half-crazy, mostly naked people, unless they have a reason to hide. We hoped you\u2019d open up a little, but you did your job well, so we didn\u2019t pry.</p><p>\u201cBut to be honest, I\u2019m not in a good frame of mind to hear your explanations right now. I\u2019m in a bit of a panic about this whole baby thing. I just found out a couple of weeks ago, and everybody keeps telling me, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s no big deal, women in our family all have easy pregnancies.\u2019 But we\u2019ve never had a pregnant alpha before, mostly because they were dudes. I\u2019m terrified of shifting, for some reason, even though I know my own mother did it until a month before she had me. I can\u2019t so much as look at coffee without barfing like something out of that Monty Python \u2018wafer-thin mint\u2019 sketch. And I\u2019m afraid of lifting anything. Nick actually found me crying in the garage this morning, because I needed to put a gas can in the back of my truck, but I didn\u2019t want to lift it, and I didn\u2019t want to ask him for help for something so simple. So my husband now thinks I\u2019m insane, which is awesome. So really, I just need you to forget about whatever excuse you were going to give me for disappearing from the face of the earth without a word, and give me an exam to show me that everything is normal and healthy and I am not giving birth to some sort of Cthulhu baby.\u201d</p><p>I stared at my badass werewolf alpha-lady boss as she burst into tears. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate this!\u201d She sniffled. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m really excited about the baby. But I hate feeling like I don\u2019t have control over anything, including my hormones. I mean, I watched all of my cousins cry and power-eat ice cream through their pregnancies and thought, not me. Not Maggie-Effing-Graham. I\u2019ll be the Chuck Norris of pregnant ladies. And look at me! I don\u2019t cry! I hate feeling so girlie and stupid about everything. And I really, really want some peanut butter fudge ripple, but I don\u2019t want to ask Nick to go get it for me, because I don\u2019t want to hear any of my cousins say \u2018I told you so.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>I circled the desk and wrapped my arms around my patient as she sobbed into my jacket. I patted her hair and rubbed her back and assured her that what she was going through was completely normal. I laughed a little as she sniffled into my shoulder, and that earned me a light punch to the kidney.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me,\u201d she grumbled, squeezing me. \u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sighed. \u201cBut I think this will help me get back in your good graces.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Maggie to mop up her red, runny nose, I took out her official mayoral stationery and wrote out a \u201cprescription\u201d for her. She read over the paper I handed her. She rolled her eyes. \u201cFive hundred ccs of peanut butter fudge ripple ice cream, to be delivered orally and in secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell Nick that if he tells anybody about his ice cream run, I will find a way to erase all of his interview recordings,\u201d I told her.</p><p>\u201cI like you.\u201d She knew exactly what sort of terror the threat to Nick\u2019s recordings would inspire in her folklorist husband. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of high-maintenance and sneaky, but I like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the clinic, and we\u2019ll get you checked out. And I\u2019ll give you some prenatal vitamins that might help with your coffee issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you, too, Mags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it.\u201d</p><p>Stepping out into the snowy street, I noticed a dozen or so pack members oh-so-casually milling around the sidewalk in front of the community center. I stopped in my tracks, waiting for pitchforks or torches to come out. But the expressions on the various aunts\u2019 and uncles\u2019 faces were more curious than angry. My face flushed warm. How was I going to explain my absence? What had Caleb already told them?</p><p>With more mercy than I expected from her, Maggie called out, \u201cNothing to see here, people. Move along.\u201d</p><p>The response was instantaneous. All of the loiterers turned their backs and walked off, as if they suddenly remembered urgent business at least twenty yards away.</p><p>Clearly, the way to reconcile with Maggie was icecream bribery. I looked over my shoulder, toward the pregnant alpha, who was waving me away with one hand while dialing her cell phone with the other.</p><p>Caleb lived in a house on the edge of the village, a low-slung, tidy structure with blue siding and white shutters that had belonged to his father before him. I\u2019d never given it much consideration before, but now it seemed that I might be living here. Would there be room for me? Would Caleb and I be happy here?</p><p>I dropped my bag in the snow and stared at the front door. The windows were dark. What if the door was locked? What if Caleb had changed his mind and decided he didn\u2019t want me there? The \u201crabbit\u201d in me wanted to yell for Leonard to come back and get me.</p><p>This elusive instinct only ramped up as I heard the muffled thumping of wolf paws hitting packed snow. I turned to see several large wolves cantering into the town limits, nudging and nipping at one another playfully. This was the afternoon patrol, running the boundaries of the valley to check for intruders or hunters straying too far from the nearby nature preserve. I searched the thundering herd for any sign of a large gray male, but before I could spot him, a blur of dark fur and gold light came flying at me. A very naked Caleb landed on his feet just in front of me, scooping me up and crushing me against him. The other wolves made a huff-whicker sound, which translated to \u201cWhipped!\u201d among Caleb\u2019s werewolf brethren.</p><p>I threw my legs around his waist, nearly bowling him over as I covered his face in kisses. Caleb\u2019s warm mouth pressed to mine, and he murmured apologies and endearments against my lips.</p><p>Several of the loitering uncles whooped and whistled at the spectacle we were making of ourselves. \u201cYou owe me five bucks, Donnie!\u201d Uncle Doug yelled. \u201cI told you his truck smelled like the doc!\u201d</p><p>I pulled back from Caleb\u2019s kisses, so I was sure to be understood. \u201cJust one thing,\u201d I told him as I cocked my foot back and kicked him in the shin so hard I may have splintered a metatarsal.</p><p>He winced, but he didn\u2019t drop me.</p><p>\u201cIf you ever keep a secret of this magnitude from me again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll take away my shins. I understand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I will ensure that you are so itchy, nauseated, and pustulated that bruised shins will be the least of your problems. Don\u2019t doubt that I have the skills necessary to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPustulated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me get the medical textbooks. The illustrations will make you cry.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here,\u201d he breathed into my neck. \u201cI was so scared you wouldn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, jostling me a little as my feet barely scraped against the snow. \u201cI can\u2019t blame you. I can\u2019t imagine how it must have felt to see that stupid e-mail. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t up-front with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t call you, but I was afraid you wouldn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I left you. I should have stayed and worked things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you all those horrible names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t call me that many names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my head, I did,\u201d I admitted. \u201cA lot. Really bad ones.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019ve established that you\u2019re both sorry,\u201d Maggie said, shaking her head as she crossed the street with Samson, her unofficial second-in-command.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about human women that turns the men of this family into complete idiots?\u201d Samson asked. \u201cIdiots who will phase in broad daylight in the middle of the street, where any human visitor could spot them, just so they can hug their mate?\u201d</p><p>Caleb gave Maggie a sheepish look. Or at least, as sheepish as a werewolf can pull off.</p> <p>\u201cSo, back for good?\u201d Maggie asked Caleb, although I wasn\u2019t sure which of us she meant.</p><p>\u201cWe both are,\u201d Caleb agreed, then turned his attention to me. \u201cThough there are going to be a few things you\u2019re going to need to do for us to make this work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike dirty, sexy things?\u201d I offered hopefully.</p><p>\u201cLike filing a restraining order and reopening your divorce case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is neither dirty nor sexy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI plan on marrying you, Dr. Campbell. And I don\u2019t plan on getting arrested for bigamy. Besides, you can\u2019t let him chase you for the rest of your days. You have to make a stand sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll take one look at the information on the paperwork, and he\u2019ll be able to find me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThere are steps that we can take, legal and not so legal, to prevent him from finding you. And even if he does, I\u2019ll be right here with you. Not to mention a pack of giant werewolves who are pretty darn fond of you.\u201d When I frowned, he added, \u201cHe won\u2019t be able to hurt you, Rabbit. I promise you. You\u2019re not alone anymore.\u201d</p><p>I looked up into his big brown eyes. And I knew that he meant it. I cast a glance over his shoulder to Maggie, who nodded. \u201cOK. I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll file the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. Now, would you two please calm your dramatic asses down and go inside? People are starting to stare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaggie likes me,\u201d I told him. \u201cI\u2019ve really grown on her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave not!\u201d Maggie called over her shoulder as she and Samson headed back to the community center.</p><p>The other wolves nudged us as they passed, pausing to press their cold, wet noses to my hand in greeting. They trotted off to their homes, careful to phase only after someone let them inside.</p><p>Caleb grinned at me. \u201cLet\u2019s get you into the house. You have bags to unpack.\u201d</p><p>He hitched me over his shoulder, and I nearly came face-to-cheek with his bare butt. I yelped, bracing myself against his back to avoid impact. He picked up my bags with his other hand and carried me up the steps. I had only one question left to ask. \u201cHow are you not cold right now?\u201d</p><p>Our routine changed.</p><p>I\u2019d wondered before what life would be like if we stayed in one place. It turned out that life was bizarrely, shockingly normal. We ate together in our kitchen, without waitstaff\u2014or, tragically, people to cook or do the dishes. (Learning to split chores was an interesting, relationship-defining experience. I loved the man, but I drew the line at exclusive bathroom-cleaning duties.) We made up for lack of car time together by logging lots of hours on his couch watching movies. Caleb was a shameless fan of the professional-wrestler-turned-action-star oeuvre, while I stuck with John Hughes. We slept, wound together in a comfortable bed. We learned how to make love leisurely, without worrying about someone in the next room hearing us.</p><p>Now that Caleb had decided to stick closer to the valley, I went online for information about opening a licensed, legitimate private-investigation service. When spring came, he would have to travel a little bit, but a good portion of his caseload could be handled over the Internet. Maggie was more than willing to offer Caleb the sheriff\u2019s position.</p><p>For the moment, Caleb was officially off-duty, so he devoted his energies to getting his dad\u2019s house back in order and ready for winter. Normally, this was something he should have started months ago, but the others in the pack were willing to help check the stability of the roof, reseal the windows, and stack cords of wood.</p> <p>I went back to work at the clinic. The old men and mothers in the village forgave me instantly, flooding my office with arthritis complaints and kids in need of checkups. The pack aunties were slower to warm. I didn\u2019t get the cold shoulder, by any means, but the candor and connection I\u2019d once shared with the older ladies of the village had evaporated. I figured that could be reestablished in time. And while they weren\u2019t exactly smothering me with affection, they expressed their fondness for Caleb by filling our kitchen with casseroles, beef roasts, and a plethora of pies. I wasn\u2019t totally taken off-guard. I\u2019d received plenty of drop-by casseroles from my neighbors and patients. What did surprise me was the recipes, accompanied by comments such as \u201cCaleb has always favored my fried apples\u201d or \u201cCaleb doesn\u2019t like his meat too well done, so you\u2019re going to need to cut the roasting time by about forty-five minutes.\u201d Apparently, I was expected to feed him.</p><p>Once I stopped laughing, I informed Caleb that I could make him an omelet if he wanted it, but beyond that, we were going to have to scrape along together for a while. He promised he would show me how to make his dad\u2019s tuna noodle casserole.</p><p>Although I treasured those days, I knew they wouldn\u2019t be enough. I was greedy. I wanted Christmases and Sunday breakfasts and hearing Caleb cursing as he stepped on our kids\u2019 Legos in the middle of the night. Kids\u2014I wanted kids. And if Caleb\u2019s genes had their say, I would have more than my share of them. For the first time since those early days as Glenn\u2019s blushing bride, I found I didn\u2019t mind the idea of children. I could see a whole gaggle of dark-haired, blue-eyed little wolves running out our front door for hockey practice and pack runs. They would be beautiful, strong children, with more people to love them than I could count.</p><p>I wanted that so much my eyes watered with it.</p><p>Caleb was happiest when he ran with the pack. It was as if the wolfy part of his brain was finally in balance with the rest of him. He was the most contented, the most at peace, that I\u2019d ever seen him.</p><p>I, on the other hand, grew more twitchy by the day. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew these days wouldn\u2019t last. A sense of inevitable doom had hung over my head ever since I\u2019d filed the paperwork for a restraining order, using the e-mails and that he\u2019d hired a private investigator to find me as proof of Glenn\u2019s bad intent. I\u2019d also refiled my divorce paperwork with the help of Nate Gogan, the sole attorney in Grundy. My divorce proceedings were complicated by the fact that I\u2019d run away. He had earned his retainer that week.</p><p>The papers included my current address. It was only a matter of time before Glenn showed up, and I couldn\u2019t imagine that would end well for either of us.</p><p>Glenn\u2019s lack of reaction after being served with the restraining order didn\u2019t exactly make me feel better. I contacted Red-burn to update her on my situation and ask her to keep an ear out for any Glenn-related information on the Network\u2019s channels, but there had been nothing.</p><p>Glenn was unstable, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. He would know better than to show up here the minute he received a restraining order, particularly if that sudden appearance preceded my sudden disappearance. That didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t planning. I knew how his brain worked. He\u2019d probably researched every resource he could find for information about my new address. Hell, he probably had a full geological survey of the valley by now. Somehow, knowing he was out there scheming was almost worse than his storming the front door. I kept a game face for Caleb and the pack, even when I felt as if I was unraveling. But in private, when Caleb was running or playing cards with his cousins, I indulged in a little brooding.</p><p>I was sitting on the front porch of Caleb\u2019s house, wrapped in blankets, enjoying the sight of thick, new-fallen snow, when Maggie, in wolf form, came trotting onto the porch. She was a sleek black female, small but, somehow, still very intimidating.</p><p>Other than the fact that she was carrying one baby instead of the expected werewolf multiples, Maggie was enjoying a perfectly normal werewolf pregnancy. Nick was over the moon and insisted on documenting every moment of the pregnancy, videotaping the consultation and the ultrasound. Maggie resisted confiscating his camera until he mentioned taping the stirrups portion of the exam.</p><p>I gave wolf-Maggie a weak smile and rubbed behind her ears. In a flash, an irritated, naked young woman was sitting in front of me, glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cIf you try to pet me again, I will bite your hand off.\u201d</p><p>I snatched my hand back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just a reflex. Caleb likes it when I scratch behind his ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to bite you anyway now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I offer you a blanket?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo. Stop running,\u201d Maggie said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>Maggie rolled her eyes. \u201cBut you\u2019re still running. You\u2019re waiting on the first sign to take off. It\u2019s not fair to my cousin. He loves you. And any idiot can see how much you love him.\u201d</p><p>As much as I hated to admit it when Maggie was insightful, she\u2019d just nailed me. I wasn\u2019t being fair to Caleb. He had committed fully, and I had one foot out the door. I was letting years of baggage keep me from judging the situation for what it was. If I was in trouble, I had Caleb. If Caleb was in trouble, he had me and my baton. I was safe. I was protected. I was loved. I would enjoy these precious days of quiet to their fullest. It was time for the rabbit to put away her running shoes.</p><p>Something must have changed in my expression, because Maggie added, \u201cThat\u2019s as mushy as I get. I will tell you that we have double patrols around the boundaries of the valley, which we can afford to do now that we have so many extra paws around. I took those photos Caleb printed for us and posted them at the community center. Your asshole ex is our first-ever wanted poster, thank you very much. And we let Buzz know that if anyone shows up in Grundy asking questions about you, he needs to call us. He\u2019s the closest thing they have to law enforcement over there, and it\u2019s time for him to earn his piddling part-time salary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how you put it when you asked him for a favor? Because statements like that could be part of the reason people don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>Maggie scoffed. \u201cPeople love me.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at her but chose not to respond to that. \u201cSo, clearly, you have the in-person issues covered, but what happens when Glenn starts monkeying around with your records online or brings the authorities sniffing around, asking awkward questions about pregnancies that only last four months and an inordinate number of injuries related to bear traps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, what do we do when he tries to bring the pitchfork-wielding mob of humans to our door, screaming for the monsters\u2019 heads?\u201d Maggie asked, her toned laced with unholy glee. \u201cWe just put on our best human faces, all innocent eyes and guileless smiles that say, \u2018Oh, gee, Mr. Health Official, I don\u2019t know how our paperwork got so messed up. We\u2019re just sweet, unpretentious country folk who don\u2019t understand them fancy computers.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cYour smiles say all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how often it works,\u201d Maggie assured me. \u201cI mean, really, who\u2019s going to believe that my aunt Winnie is a werewolf? People want to believe what they know to be true. They\u2019ll grasp on to any rational explanation we give them. And if they don\u2019t buy it at first, we just keep pushing, finding new stories to tell, until they do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it wouldn\u2019t cause complications or problems, but as smart as your husband is, he\u2019s not enough of an evil genius to blow our cover. We\u2019ve faced better operators than him over the years. We have devious, slightly more violent methods to deal with him that are best left to your imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can take care of him. Of course, you would have known this if you\u2019d told me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHindsight and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow comes the part where I threaten to kick your ass from here to Ontario if you hurt Caleb.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWouldn\u2019t expect anything less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, I\u2019d fix it so they\u2019d use your carcass as bait on that Deadliest Catch show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo to make me feel safer and calmer, you\u2019re threatening me with graphic, grievous bodily harm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle too far there, Mags.\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>This Is Why You Use the Buddy System</p><p>With my real birthday on the horizon\u2014not the birthday listed on the \u201cAnna Moder\u201d paperwork\u2014the werewolf aunties insisted on hosting a big joint celebration of my thirty-fourth year and Caleb\u2019s permanent return to the pack. It was the first opportunity for the pack to put on a big spread since the first hard frost. I didn\u2019t mind being used, as long as it meant Aunt Winnie brought her hash-brown casserole.</p><p>So one not-so-special Friday evening, when the roads were clearer than usual, every aunt, uncle, and cousin jammed into the community center to stuff themselves silly under a jungle of tissue-paper flowers produced by Samson\u2019s mate, Alicia. Even Mo and Cooper made the treacherous snowmobile trip with their toddler, Eva, to welcome us back into the fold. They were the last of the relatives I\u2019d \u201cfooled\u201d with my false identity. I liked Mo quite a bit, and I hated the idea of her shunning me as a result of perfectly justified hurt feelings.</p><p>I should have known better. Mo adjusted to my news the way she had adjusted to most things pack-related: smoothly and with style. She just grinned and threw her arm around me when she and Cooper had made their way through the throng of noshing werewolves.</p><p>\u201cWell, now that I know who you are, I\u2019m a little ashamed of myself. I thought I knew another Southern transplant when I saw one,\u201d Mo said, grinning, shifting the sleepy-looking toddler so she could extend her hand as if to reintroduce herself. \u201cLeland, Mississippi.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shook her outstretched hand, and the handshake turned into a hug. \u201cJackson, Tennessee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how glad I am that you\u2019re back.

The big sissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did break the skin,\u201d Cooper pointed out, though there was a note of pride in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cWell, that was the only way she could express \u2018I do not appreciate the intrusion of your booster-shot needle\u2019 with the emphasis she felt was necessary,\u201d Mo said primly.</p><p>Cooper rolled his eyes but only slightly. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re back, Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to be back,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m glad you dragged my idiot cousin home with you,\u201d Cooper added. \u201cIf anybody can straighten his stubborn ass out, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said. \u201cI hope I\u2019m up to the challenge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you know you are,\u201d Mo said. \u201cIf he\u2019s anything like Cooper, he\u2019d hand you the moon and stars if you looked at \u2019em twice. They\u2019re shamelessly devoted to their mates, all of them. Even Maggie.\u201d</p><p>Maggie overheard this and sent a rude gesture Mo\u2019s way, which Mo returned without breaking her verbal stride.</p><p>\u201cMaggie told me you\u2019ve had some trouble. And for Maggie to tell me anything means that she\u2019s worried. Let them help you, Tina. Trust in them. They\u2019ll stand for you until the very end; it\u2019s in their natures.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd if they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll just knock the hell out of your ex with a fire extinguisher. It\u2019s sort of my thing.\u201d</p><p>I snickered, pressing my lips together to keep from ruining this bonding moment. Mo was known for her prowess with both kitchen knives and fire-suppression equipment, having knocked Maggie unconscious with a fire extinguisher when her sister-in-law had gotten just a little too close to wounding Cooper in a street brawl.</p> <p>\u201cWe gals are in the same boat when it comes to being mated to these yahoos,\u201d she said, wrapping her arm around my shoulders. \u201cWe humans have to stick together. Maybe we can form a club or a support group. Nick would be perfect for organizing that sort of thing. Hey, Nick!\u201d She called after her brother-in-law, who was in a corner, holding a digital recorder in Caleb\u2019s face. Mo easily handed her daughter off to Cooper, who watched his wife scamper off with a bemused expression.</p><p>\u201cRuns at a mile a minute, my mate,\u201d he said fondly. \u201cAnd her brain runs even faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really missed you all,\u201d I told him, letting Eva play with the beading on my sweater while she leaned her head against her daddy\u2019s shoulder. I stroked her sleek blue-black hair, still marveling at the full mane this toddler managed to grow. She was only two, and it was almost down to her waist. \u201cI know I was only gone a few months, but I feel like I missed so much. Eva\u2019s getting so big!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not too big, right?\u201d Cooper asked, anxious. \u201cShe\u2019s where she needs to be growth chart\u2013wise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfect,\u201d I assured him as my fingers brushed over her forehead. I paused. She was a little warm. I checked her nose, which was predictably runny and flush with thin mucus. Her lymph nodes were slightly swollen, and from the way she draped herself against her daddy, you could tell she wasn\u2019t exactly bounding with energy.</p><p>\u201cEverything OK?\u201d Caleb asked, anxious again.</p><p>\u201cWell, it looks like she could be coming down with a cold. Has she complained about her head or her throat hurting?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but she\u2019s napped a lot today, more than usual,\u201d he admitted, rubbing her back.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s in the early stages yet, and at this age, she can\u2019t really articulate headaches,\u201d I said, glancing over my shoulder. \u201cHey, Uncle Dan, do you have your Maglite?\u201d</p><p>Dan proudly held up the little flashlight he kept in a holster at his hip, an idea he\u2019d latched onto after watching too many episodes of CSI. \u201cI told you it would come in handy!\u201d he crowed.</p><p>\u201cYes, your moment of triumph has arrived,\u201d I retorted, taking the offered flashlight and gently prying Eva\u2019s mouth open. I shone the light into her throat and winced at the sight of red, inflamed tissue. \u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s some sinus drainage you got there, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Cooper asked, his voice slightly panicked. \u201cDo we need to take her to the hospital? Should we call nine-one-one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why Mo handles most of her checkups, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I deadpanned.</p><p>Cooper grumbled a bit. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine. Right now, it\u2019s probably just a little cold, one of many little colds she\u2019s going to have over the course of her life. But just to be sure, take her back into Maggie\u2019s office, and I\u2019ll do an exam. I just have to run over to the clinic to get my medical bag and some of the medications she might need. You keep her in here where it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we come to the clinic with you?\u201d Cooper asked. \u201cYou have all of the equipment there, those defibrillator paddles and the intubation stuff and . . .\u201d He trailed off as I gave him an amused look. \u201cWe\u2019ll just go wait for you in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK, then,\u201d I told him, patting his arm. \u201cLet Caleb know where I went?\u201d</p><p>Cooper nodded.</p><p>I quietly slid into my coat, hoping not to attract the attention of aunties with second helpings. I stepped out into the bitter cold, refreshed by the untouched air, even as it slapped against my cheeks. It was a bit of a relief to get out of the crowd and the noise. As much as I loved the pack, it would take some time before I was used to their exuberance again.</p><p>Shivering, I stomped out onto the street, watching for patches of black ice under the shin-deep blanket of snow. The last thing I needed was to bust my butt on slick pavement and lie there in the dark for hours while the party raged on.</p><p>Who was I kidding? Caleb would notice I was gone within a few minutes and organize a full-on search party.</p><p>I shivered in my jacket, my steps slowing as I crunched through the snow to listen for . . . what? The sound of the whistling between the buildings along the main street? Fat white snowflakes splatting against the windshield of Maggie\u2019s truck? I shook my head, trudging forward, only to stop a few steps later and peer down the street toward the north ridge of the valley.</p><p>There was something off. Some organic, nervous alarm skittered up my spine and had me turning on my heel to go back to the community center. I shouldn\u2019t be out here on my own. I needed the pack. I needed\u2014</p><p>I\u2019d just passed Maggie\u2019s truck when I heard soft, steady footfalls behind me, with none of the natural grace of the Grahams. I shuddered, my breath coming in short white puffs in the frigid air. Shards of icy panic wormed their way through my stomach, making it hard to breathe or think.</p><p>Whipping around, I turned back toward the north ridge and saw Glenn standing there in all his angry glory, practically vibrating with rage under his thick Gore-Tex coat. The climate had not been kind to Glenn. His overbright brown eyes watered against the cold, prickling wind. His cheeks were fire-engine red. And instead of making him seem pathetic, the wear and tear just made him seem that much more unstable, unpredictable. Any veneer of civility had been torn away to reveal a level of crazy I\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>My heart stuttered in my chest as my brain shouted, Not real! Not real! Not real!</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything you want to say to me?\u201d he sneered, chapped lips cracking. \u201cI don\u2019t even get a hello?\u201d</p><p>I stumbled back, barely staying upright as my heel hit a patch of ice.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what you\u2019ve put me through?\u201d he demanded, stumbling forward, grabbing my arm and shaking me like a rag doll. He seemed reluctant to touch me, as if even after all of this time and all of his efforts to find me, confronting me in person was somehow harder than threatening me through a computer screen. \u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d</p><p>Panicked, runaway thoughts kept me from focusing. There was nowhere to hide, nowhere to run. I wanted to curl in on myself, make myself small. \u201cThe humiliation of you filing for divorce. Calling the cops on me. Months of searching, paying some stranger to dig into our business. Years of worrying where you were, what you were doing, who you were with. Do you know how humiliating this has been for me?\u201d</p><p>In full fury, he didn\u2019t hesitate to use the violence he used to cover up with \u201caccidents\u201d and clumsiness. He grunted, tossing me back into the snow as if I weighed nothing. I skidded across the ice-slick surface of the road, whacking my head against Maggie\u2019s bumper.</p><p>\u201cYour fault,\u201d Glenn spat. \u201cAll your fault. Losing those jobs because I was so busy looking for you. You trashed my reputation. You ruined me.\u201d</p><p>I slowly pushed myself up, gingerly turning my head back and forth. I could feel a warm trickle of blood down my back, where the base of my skull had caught the edge of the truck bumper.</p><p>Glenn shoved me back down with the toe of his boot. \u201cWhat kind of wife does that to her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your wife anymore,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my wife as long as I say you are,\u201d he growled, stepping on my chest and pushing me down into the snow. He leered down at me, as if he\u2019d been picturing me like this\u2014broken and bleeding under his foot\u2014for a very long time. He gave me one last kick before crouching over me.</p><p>I sat up again, bracing myself on the truck. \u201cYou can\u2019t hurt me anymore, Glenn. This stops now.\u201d</p><p>He acted as if he hadn\u2019t even heard me speak. \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk out of this valley, take my snowmobile back to that piss-water little town, Grungy or whatever. We\u2019re going to go back home, and you\u2019re going to beg the hospital to give us our jobs back. You\u2019re going to tell them it was all your fault that they fired me. We\u2019re going to go back to our life just the way it was. You\u2019re going to go back to being the wife you were. Now, pull your hood up, honey, we don\u2019t want you to get sick.\u201d</p><p>Flinching away when he tried to adjust my coat, I stared up at him incredulously. He had finally lost his mind. He thought we were going to go back to where we were when I left? It was insane. Any friends we\u2019d had together had no doubt stopped believing we were a couple years ago. And there was nothing I could say that would get his job back. I doubted I could get my job back at the hospital, given my abrupt exit. I shook my head, and the motion upset my equilibrium. \u201cNo,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He punched me right on the bridge of my nose, where the cartilage connects to the brow. I sank to my knees, seeing stars. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he demanded, standing over me.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said again, my voice a little louder but shakier. \u201cNo! No! NO! NO! NO!\u201d I screamed so loudly that it echoed down the street and off the trees. Glenn viciously kicked me in the ribs, cutting off the werewolf-summoning noise into a squelched cry.</p><p>\u201cI see we\u2019re going to need a little refresher, honey. I\u2019m your husband. I\u2019m in charge.\u201d He delivered another kick to my rib cage. I flopped onto my side, my face buried in snow. The tiny shards of ice burned the scrapes on my skin. I rolled faceup, my coat tangled under my body, and I felt a metal cylinder bump against my leg.</p><p>The baton. I\u2019d forgotten that Caleb had sewn a special pocket in the recesses of my coat to store the baton as a just-in-case measure. I thought it had been overkill when Caleb insisted I keep it in my pocket even after we returned to the valley. Who was going to try to hurt me on the twenty-yard walk from the clinic to our house? But now I thought it was just-enough-kill.</p><p>As Glenn grumbled to himself about my \u201cfat ungrateful ass,\u201d I slid the hand of my uninjured arm into my pocket. My fingers curled around the baton just as Glenn\u2019s foot connected with my ribs. The impact knocked me back, spinning me over and over, while the breath fled from my lungs. The baton was still clutched in my hand as I landed in the snow, a heavy weight in numbed fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhen I say stop, you stop.\u201d He grunted, kicking me in the stomach this time.</p><p>This was never going to stop.</p><p>Unable to scream for help, I lay there, cataloguing my injuries\u2014dislocated shoulder, broken nose, fractured ribs\u2014and I knew he would just keep coming after me until I was dead. Part of me wanted to give in, to let him just take me. It seemed so much easier than this constant struggle, the nagging fear. I was so cold and tired; down to my soul, I was exhausted. If I got into the car with him now, at least it would be over. He wouldn\u2019t have the chance to hurt anybody else.</p><p>\u201cWhen I say get off of your lazy, spoiled ass and get moving, you say, \u2018Yes, Glenn,\u2019 and go where I tell you.\u201d Glenn put the weight of his boot on my damaged shoulder. I made a hoarse mewling sound, one that I swore I heard echoed in a canine yelp in the distance. I rolled onto my injured side, trying to protect it. And he laughed. He was enjoying himself, the big man, the little brat who never got enough of my attention. Well, he certainly had my full attention now. My pain and fear were fun for him. And if someone was that good at hiding that he was that sick, it was not my fault that he\u2019d fooled me. He did this, not me. He was the one who manipulated and controlled and caused pain, not me. He was the asshole, not me.</p><p>I was not the problem.</p><p>I slung the weight of the baton outward with my good arm, thrilling at the metallic singing sound. Sitting up and fighting against the sick, dizzy sensation that came with it, I brought the baton down with all my strength just above his knee. A deeply satisfying crunch echoed about the street, and Glenn howled. I kicked up, catching him square in the crotch with the heel of my boot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI always was a slow learner,\u201d I huffed, struggling to my feet. \u201cSo is this what it feels like, Glenn?\u201d I slurred, standing over him as he whined and keened over his knee. I cradled my injured shoulder. \u201cDid it make you feel good to stand like this, over me, while I rolled around on the floor like a dog? Answer me!\u201d I yelled, kicking at him, catching him in the stomach.</p><p>He moaned and tried to struggle to his knees, but I brought the baton down on his back, knocking him to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat you did to me, that\u2019s your problem, your damage. You\u2019re going to have to live with it, because I\u2019m sick of carrying it around with me. You\u2019re never going to touch me again. This is over,\u201d I told him, turning toward the community center.</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re my wife.\u201d He whimpered. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d I walked away, dragging the baton behind me in the snow. My injured arm felt heavy, disconnected, as I stumbled forward. Wiping at the blood running from my mouth, I winced at the split in my lip. Just a few more steps. Just a few more steps, and I\u2019d be back in the hall. I\u2019d find Caleb. I\u2019d be OK.</p><p>I staggered forward as I was suddenly knocked to the ground. Rough hands in my hair yanked me to my feet. \u201cYou think you could just do that to me?\u201d he demanded, twisting the hair at the nape of my neck and pulling me back against him. I yelped at the sharp stabs of pain throbbing from several different locations. He wrapped his hand around my throat and squeezed, slowly pressing the breath out of my body. \u201cDid you think I would let you get away with it?\u201d</p><p>My feet scrabbled uselessly against the crust of snow. The edges of my vision started to turn gray. I swung my baton at his legs, but Glenn used his free hand to swat it out of my hand before snagging my hair again. I fought against the urge to pass out, like swimming against a tidal wave. If I passed out, he would drag me away and do God knew what with me. If I was awake, I could regain control of the situation. Maybe.</p><p>Probably not.</p> <p>A low, loud growl reverberated through the cold air, piercing my chest. Glenn\u2019s grip on my throat slackened, allowing my feet to reach the ground. I gulped huge breaths, even as he tightened his grip on my hair.</p><p>My vision cleared, allowing me to make out a dozen huge dark shapes as they separated from the shadows, edging their way into a shaft of moonlight. Right at the front of the pack, a big gray male curled his lip over his canines, letting them shine, sharp and silver in the light. If I were Glenn, I would be pissing my pants right now.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Glenn hissed, jerking at my hair, making me yelp. This drew a particularly vicious growl from the gray wolf.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that my new boyfriend\u2019s family . . . well, they\u2019re pretty special,\u201d I said, laughing softly to myself.</p><p>The Caleb wolf inched forward, the hair on his back raised, fangs bared. A small black female, Maggie, was at his side. Her stance was calmer but no less menacing. Besides Glenn and me, no humans were on the street. The pack handled pack business.</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Glenn backed away, dragging me with him. I dug my heels into the snow, doing anything I could to make this more difficult for him. I heard the same familiar low growls behind us. And I slowly realized there was a circle of wolves, tightening around me and my crazy ex-husband. They all had their heads lowered, lips curled back. Stalking. The street echoed with raspy growls. Although sick with the pain of my injuries, in the midst of this confrontation, I was as relaxed as a spa bunny after a two-hour massage. I knew I had nothing to fear. I nearly giggled at the absurdity of it.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Glenn.\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist mocking. \u201cRemember when I said we should get a dog, and you \u2018forbade\u2019 me to get one because you didn\u2019t want my attentions divided? Sort of ironic, huh?\u201d I giggled, hysteria taking over fully now.</p><p>\u201cI said shut up, or I\u2019ll snap your damn neck, Tina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do whatever you want to me,\u201d I scoffed, spitting a healthy amount of blood into the snow. \u201cYou won\u2019t even make it to your car. They\u2019ve got your scent now, Glenn. They\u2019ll run you down and leave nothing but scattered bones. You came into the woods, in the dark, thinking you were the biggest, meanest thing to walk here, because you can terrorize a woman half your size. Let me tell you something. You\u2019re an amateur. You\u2019re nothing. Forget dragons. Here there be giant, pissed-off wolves. And they are not happy with you.\u201d</p><p>Glenn shook me so hard I was sure I heard my teeth rattle. \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><p>CLANG.</p><p>Glenn released his hold on my neck. I sank to my knees, the impact buffered by the snow. I looked back to see Glenn crumpled, facedown, in the street. Mo stood behind him with a fire extinguisher raised over her head.</p><p>Glenn moaned, turning onto his back and glaring up at her. \u201cYou bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really an insult around these parts, asshole,\u201d Mo told him. \u201cYou thought Tina was alone? She\u2019s not alone here.\u201d When he tried to stumble to his feet, she brought the canister down again, just hard enough to daze him. I heard a pleased whickering sound from a large black wolf near Maggie. \u201cNormally, they wouldn\u2019t let a human get involved in messy business like this. But they needed someone to speak for the pack, because, well, their jaws are aching to close around your throat right now, and they\u2019re otherwise incapable of speech. But she\u2019s ours now. And if you come near her again\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Mo stopped as Glenn leaped to his feet and lunged for her, stumbling on slick ice and unsteady legs. The wolves\u2019 growls rose to a fever pitch as she raised the fire extinguisher over her head.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried, snatching the cylinder from her hands with my good arm and swinging it wide, connecting with the side of Glenn\u2019s head. He yelped, stumbling mid-lunge, and flopped facedown in the snow again.</p><p>Mo\u2019s eyes went wide. I dropped the fire extinguisher with a clang, wincing as every muscle in my body seemed to seize at once. My dislocated shoulder sagged, useless, at my side.</p><p>Glenn\u2019s pained moan was muffled by street slush. Mo nudged him over with her boot, so he was at least looking at her when she told him, \u201cIf you ever come near her again, the pack will find you. They will make you feel pain like no other human being has ever felt before, and then they will fix it so that your body is never found. It\u2019s not an idle threat. They\u2019re giant dogs. They\u2019re big on hiding bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill my . . .\u201d Glenn gurgled through the ice and blood crusting his face. \u201cWife. Mine.\u201d</p><p>I moved closer to him, despite the loud protesting rumbles of a certain gray wolf practically brushing against my back. I couldn\u2019t kneel or bend, because, frankly, I was doing well not to throw up on him. \u201cI\u2019m not your wife anymore. I don\u2019t want to see you. I don\u2019t want to think about you. And after today, I won\u2019t even say your name again. You\u2019re not my problem anymore.\u201d</p><p>I ignored the pathetic little noises Glenn was making, turned on my heel, and walked back toward the clinic to get a Band-Aid for my head.</p><p>(At the time, it seemed completely logical.)</p><p>But apparently, I turned a little too quickly, considering the blows to my head and the loss of blood. My eyes rolled up, and the world seemed to tilt on its axis and melt into surreal splotches of color.</p><p>The last thing I remembered was thinking how much it was going to hurt to land on my bum shoulder. And then a pair of strong, warm arms closed around me, and I felt nothing at all.</p><p>I woke up in my own clinic, the late-morning light filtering through the window and directly into my sticky, tired eyes. I immediately clapped them shut, groaning. I tried to press my good hand to them, but the IV lead pulled painfully, and I stopped. I tried to raise myself slowly on the crisp white cotton sheets, my head too swimmy to manage it. I smacked my dry, sandpapery mouth, wincing.</p><p>Just lying there in the clinic\u2019s lone hospital bed, I could tell I had a concussion, a few busted ribs, and a reset shoulder. My lip was split, and I had a few lacerations. Considering what had happened, I got through relatively unscathed.</p><p>Maggie was sitting at the side of my bed, leafing through a Carol Higgins Clark paperback. I blinked at her, fighting to keep both eyes focused on her face. \u201cMorphine, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope so. That\u2019s what the label said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, right now, I can\u2019t think much beyond, \u2018Morphine, yay!\u2019 \u201d I giggled.</p><p>\u201cCaleb wouldn\u2019t let us reset your shoulder without it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, hissing as my fingers found the bruises on my neck. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank my mom. She was the only one who knew how to do it or the IV.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. Gracie Graham had spent the better part of her life patching up her hooligan children, so she was a natural to assist me in the clinic during the occasional emergency. She would have made an excellent nurse if she could have left the valley long enough for college. The fact that she\u2019d set my shoulder, kept me hydrated, used the monitoring equipment correctly, and not killed me with a morphine overdose was testament to her competence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out for more than twenty-four hours. It\u2019s weird watching someone take so long to heal. I don\u2019t know how you humans stand it. I\u2019ve told Nick he\u2019s not allowed to get seriously hurt, ever.\u201d</p><p>Maggie held a glass of water to my lips, allowing me to gulp it down. The sensation sliding down my parched throat was absolute bliss. She saw me glancing around the room. \u201cCaleb is practically pawing down the door to get in here, but he kept wolfing out every time you twitched or your pulse spiked. Destroyed three chairs and an IV pole, not to mention all those shirts. So we sent him on a run . . . which lasted about five minutes before he was right back at the door, trying to get back in. So we tricked him into going to your house for some extra socks and locked him out.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, wincing at the dulled pain radiating through my injured ribs. \u201cOw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s had his face pressed against the glass like one of those freaky cling-film families people stick on their car windows.\u201d</p><p>I laughed again, repeating the wincing process. \u201cStop making me laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to keep myself entertained somehow,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cWhere did they take him?\u201d I asked, and because Maggie was occasionally intuitive to the point of freakiness, she knew exactly whom I was talking about.</p><p>\u201cTo the village jail,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a holding cell for younger pack members having difficulty adjusting to their transition, which means they can get out of control. Disciplinary actions are always handled within the pack, no legal system required. But we dress it up as a jail because outsiders would ask too many questions otherwise. We\u2019ll hand him over to the state police once he\u2019s healed up a bit\u2014before you get out of here, anyway. Don\u2019t want the cops wondering how the hell he got so beat up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack worked him over pretty good, huh?\u201d</p><p>Maggie shook her head. \u201cNo, slugger, you worked him over with the baton. I will say that Mom is treating him just as carefully as she did you, but he\u2019s not getting any of the tender, loving care. I think she enjoys ripping off his bandages a little too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he knows about the wolves,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them what?\u201d Maggie snorted. \u201cThat while he was beating and kidnapping his ex-wife, a pack of wolves surrounded him while another woman smacked him with a fire extinguisher? They\u2019ll send him to prison by way of the loony bin, which would suit me just fine. Besides, he didn\u2019t see any of us phase. And in my official capacity as what passes for law enforcement in this village, I can inform you that he messed up big-time. Violating the restraining order before the ink was even dry, assault, attempted kidnapping. You\u2019ll have to testify, but he\u2019s going to face real jail time, Doc.\u201d</p><p>I expected some twinge of guilt, thinking of the man I\u2019d loved enough to marry sitting in a tiny cell for years. But he\u2019d hurt me in so many ways. He was a criminal. He belonged in jail.</p><p>\u201cNow, before Caleb batters down the door, I am about to say something you\u2019ll probably never hear from me again.\u201d</p><p>I arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou chose to do this when I\u2019m on serious drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said.</p><p>The other eyebrow went up. \u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d been watching your ex for three days. He\u2019d been circling the perimeter, trying to get a look at you. The restraining order was pretty specific about distances, and he was staying outside the limits. I wanted to wait until he did something stupid so we could call the state police and press charges that would stick. We had someone watching you every second of the day. But with the party and all, everybody in one spot, we figured you were covered. By the time we figured out that he got past our boundaries . . . I was really scared for you, Doc.\u201d She cleared her throat, her big brown eyes shimmering with tears. \u201cWe only just got you back, and I was afraid . . . oh, shit, here I go again.\u201d She sobbed softly.</p><p>I tried to reach up to pat her shoulder, but one arm was immobile and the other was hooked up to an IV. Nick and Caleb appeared at the door. Nick barely suppressed a smile as he hauled his hormonal mate to her feet. \u201cThis happens about once a day,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt does not.\u201d She sniffled.</p><p>Behind her back, he nodded and mouthed, \u201cYes, it does.\u201d</p><p>Caleb pounced on the chair at my bedside as his cousin was spirited away with promises of steak wrapped in bacon. He pressed his face against my good arm, wallowing there a bit before leaning up to gently kiss my damaged lips. He tilted his forehead against mine and sighed, as if he\u2019d been holding his breath for days. \u201cPlease don\u2019t ever do that again,\u201d he whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taking some small measure of glee in picturing Glenn in an orange jumpsuit, I kissed the bridge of Caleb\u2019s nose and told him, \u201cI can almost guarantee it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat works both ways, you know,\u201d I told him dryly.</p> <p>\u201cNo more secrets,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo more secrets,\u201d I promised.</p><p>\u201cOK, then I can give you this.\u201d He opened a small black velvet box to show me a respectable solitaire set in platinum, with scrollwork designs on the band. Well, it looked like scrollwork at first. Upon closer examination, it was\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre those bunnies?\u201d I asked, squinting at the engraving.</p><p>\u201cJust one on one side,\u201d he said, holding the other side of the band closer so I could see the stylized wolf loping along the opposite side from the bunny. \u201cI did a little reading. Did you know that rabbits can survive in just about any climate? Desert, tundra, forest. And in most cultures, they\u2019re the symbol of renewal, because you can count on them, every spring, to crank out a whole new generation of little rabbits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I like where this is going, Caleb. Land your plane,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He continued as if I hadn\u2019t rudely interrupted his nature rant. \u201cSo I called you Rabbit at first because you ran, which wasn\u2019t all that nice of me. But you\u2019re also adaptable, resourceful, and no matter how hard you\u2019re knocked down, you just keep coming back. Renewal, Tina. Starting over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d I told him. \u201cJust leave the fertility stuff out of it when you tell your family our proposal story. M\u2019kay?\u201d</p><p>He grinned and tried to press his case one step further. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to insist on unlimited shared showers and naked Saturdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day of the week is Naked Day with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust humor me, woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaked breakfast on Saturdays,\u201d I counteroffered. He groaned. \u201cI might have to go to work or something!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told me, kissing the undamaged corner of my mouth.</p><p>I tugged at his sleeve, slowly scooting over so he could cram his large frame into the narrow hospital bed with me. \u201cI love you, too, which is why I am also willing to offer naked Sunday brunch.\u201d</p><p>He carefully arranged his body around mine and sighed into my hair. \u201cYou\u2019re the best mate ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d</p><p>16</p><p>The Valley Gets Even More Visitors, None of Whom We Knock Unconscious</p><p>The practically balmy March wind blew gently over my cheeks as I sat on the porch of our house and sipped my tea.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know what Gracie put in it, and I chose not to ask. But it was a nice, calming blend that helped me unwind at the end of a long day. I was still training my nerves to wind down to a nonpanic state. When someone called me Tina, it still took me a moment to realize they were talking to me and respond. It would be a long time before I would be able to walk into a room without scouting out the exits. And I would always have a problem sitting with my back to a door. But I was slowly and steadily beginning to accept the fact that my ex couldn\u2019t hurt me anymore, that my life was my own again.</p><p>I started talk therapy with a specialized counselor who worked out of Portland. Samantha Farraday was willing to do sessions via video chat, and we were focusing on linear discussions of \u201ctrauma,\u201d since my experience was considered \u201cprolonged\u201d by my going into hiding. I liked Samantha. She didn\u2019t accept nonsense, bullshit, or rationalizations, which was something I needed.</p><p>Caleb was supportive of the endeavor, especially if it meant I felt more comfortable getting married within the next year or so. The claiming bite could come at any time, as far as I was concerned, but Caleb wanted to make sure I was ready. For my part, I was settled. I wasn\u2019t afraid. I knew where and with whom I would be spending my future.</p><p>I stood on the front porch, watching the sun go down over the lip of the valley. Caleb was on a patrol with the pack and would be home any minute. I finally had a home to call my own, where I was safe and loved. It would take a while to straighten out the official paperwork that would allow me to make life with Caleb permanent. Thanks to Glenn\u2019s cyber-antics, there were a lot of debts and criminal charges in my name that needed to be cleared up. Not to mention the fact that I was still legally married.</p><p>But as far as the pack was concerned, Caleb was my mate. I was a permanent part of the pack, and I was their own. We weren\u2019t thinking about children, but we knew it would happen eventually. We were going to let ourselves be caught off-guard by a good surprise for once.</p><p>A black SUV with heavily tinted windows crunched down Main Street, drawing stares from my neighbors. A few of the males tracked the vehicle\u2019s progress as it approached the clinic and seemed to be stopping. I arched my eyebrows.</p><p>We didn\u2019t get strangers here. We certainly didn\u2019t advertise the clinic\u2019s services outside the valley, so it was unlikely that this was a drop-in patient. I stuck my hand into my pocket, to assure myself that the special sparkly canister of pepper spray Mo had given me was still there.</p><p>A tall, willowy woman with red hair and pale skin opened the passenger-side door. She was strikingly beautiful, a sort of redheaded Grace Kelly, in her dark pea coat and celery-green turtleneck. The man who stepped out of the driver\u2019s side didn\u2019t quite match her elegance. He was tall and lanky, with shaggy dark blond hair and equally pale, Puckish features. His eyes were bright, full of mirth, but it was a naughty sort of humor, which had me checking my other pocket to keep a hand on my wallet. He was wearing frayed jeans and a sweatshirt that said, \u201cIt\u2019s a bit nippley out.\u201d</p><p>The woman watched my eyes widen, then followed my line of sight to the man\u2019s shirt and sighed. \u201cDamn it, Dick. I told you not to wear that! It\u2019s off-putting!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hilarious!\u201d the man insisted.</p><p>\u201cPlease excuse my husband. It\u2019s a lot warmer in Kentucky. The cold is doing strange things to his mind,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI\u2019m assuming this is the clinic? We were looking for a Dr. Tina Campbell.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped open, but I recovered quickly. \u201cWho\u2019s asking for her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old friend,\u201d the woman said, grinning, her sharp-looking white teeth glinting against the porch light. \u201cI recognize your voice, Doctor. I\u2019m so glad to meet you!\u201d</p><p>She reached out and pumped my hand vigorously, making me wince at the strength of her grip. The pained expression on my face brought more than a few growls from the werewolves circling ever closer to the clinic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, do I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Andrea Cheney,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know me as Red-burn.\u201d</p><p>Though the revelation of my mysterious visitor\u2019s identity was a shock, several other mental tumblers fell into place and my mouth dropped open in a more humorous parody of The Scream. Suddenly, Red-burn\u2019s occasional daytime crankiness and availability for late-night conversations made so much more sense\u2014as did the fact that neither she nor her husband seemed at all surprised by the presence of enormous wolves.</p><p>We didn\u2019t get many vampires in these parts\u2014or any, really\u2014something about the cold temperatures and weird seasonal daylight patterns. Grundy werewolves, while not particularly surprised when the vampires emerged from their coffins, reserved full belief in another supernatural species until they met one in person. Even Nick, as mad as he was for all things supernatural, was downright dubious about the existence of vampires for years after the Coming Out. He simply didn\u2019t believe a creature could hide under the radar for so long without being documented by nosy human scholars like him. Short of being bitten, he held on to some skepticism. And then he met a bunch of werewolves and his mind opened up that much more.</p><p>Andrea and her husband\u2019s arrival was going to be the talk of the pack all winter.</p><p>I squealed and threw my arms around her, drawing giggles from her and the man behind her. The werewolves relaxed but stayed close. \u201cIt\u2019s OK!\u201d I called. \u201cIt\u2019s OK. This is my old friend Andrea . . . and . . . ?\u201d I looked to the man with the naughty smile.</p><p>\u201cDick,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m this lucky lady\u2019s husband.\u201d</p><p>Andrea rolled her eyes. \u201cHusband, yes. Lucky? Debatable.\u201d</p><p>Maggie stepped forward. \u201cRed-burn? You sent Eli the e-mails? You\u2019re the one who helped An\u2014Tina get a job here?\u201d</p><p>Andrea nodded, clasping my arms in her hands and giving them a friendly squeeze. \u201cWhen I heard that you\u2019d \u2018come out\u2019 and filed for divorce, I had to come by and see you for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy to meet you!\u201d I said, sniffing a little. \u201cI owe you so much!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than I owed the person who helped me find my way out of a bad relationship,\u201d Andrea said. She turned to Maggie and explained, \u201cBefore Dick, I dated a man who, let\u2019s say, wasn\u2019t so nice to me. It took a clean break and a rushed move to another state to get clear of him. And now I have a lot of spare time at night, and the Network helps me feel like I\u2019m doing something constructive. Tina\u2019s was the first case I handled on my own.\u201d She turned back to me. \u201cDid you know that?\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cShe talked about you all the time,\u201d Dick said. \u201cIn a completely undetailed and anonymous fashion.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cShe worried a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh, you drove all the way from Kentucky!\u201d I cried. \u201cCome in, come in, you must be exhausted! Can I get you anything to eat or drink?\u201d</p><p>Dick shook his head, reaching into the SUV to pull an insulated cooler bag from the seat. \u201cThat\u2019s OK. We\u2019re on a special diet.\u201d</p><p>Maggie frowned but said nothing. \u201cCan you tell Caleb to come home?\u201d I asked her, leading the couple toward our house.</p><p>Dick made a big show of stomping the slush from his boots, but I could tell there was no small amount of glee at coming into contact with actual snow. Andrea told me quietly that their hometown didn\u2019t see much beyond sleet, and Dick had been acting like a big, goofy kid ever since they reached the state line. I got the impression that Dick acted like a big, goofy kid regardless of location. I made a mental note to keep him away from Samson.</p><p>\u201cWhat an adorable house.\u201d Andrea sighed as she surveyed the small, steady modifications we\u2019d been making to the living room and kitchen. I\u2019d painted the walls a warm, creamy yellow to bring a little sunlight into the rooms. Caleb had cleared out some of his mom\u2019s knickknacks to make room for our own mementos, a carved wooden wolf from his cousin Cooper and a framed picture of us smiling into the camera with Suds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet her fella didn\u2019t make her install a man cave.\u201d She sent a fake pout toward Dick. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on there, and I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell Andrea that the whole valley was basically one big man cave.</p><p>\u201cA bet is a bet, woman,\u201d Dick grumbled.</p><p>I giggled, closing the door, mentally estimating how long it would take Caleb to run here to meet our new friends. Friends. Family. Home. Three words I hadn\u2019t thought I would ever be able to attach to my life again, before I\u2019d come here, to this valley full of werewolves. And now I had all three.</p><p>Life, for the moment, was very, very good. </p> </body></html>"]
