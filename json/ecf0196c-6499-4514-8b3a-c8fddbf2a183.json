Mia\u2019s governess had taught her all about Dante\u2019s nine infernal circles.</p><p>Mia\u2019s first circle had required her to make her debut at fifteen, under the aegis of a hired chaperone, because her mother was dead. Her second circle had added a far worse indignity: her charming, widowed father was conducting a flagrant affaire with a married duchess that everyone in the fashionable world knew about.</p><p>She had entered the third circle over the last year or so, when against all reason, she had fallen desperately in love with the same duchess\u2019 son, Vander. He was the most sensitive, intelligent boy in the world (or so Mia thought). And he was beautiful too, with a face that resembled the stone angels that guarded babies\u2019 graves.</p><p>The remaining circles of hell? All six?</p><p>They were revealing themselves in rapid succession. Mia had begged her father to attend the Villiers\u2019s musicale on the chance that the object of her adoration, Evander Septimus Brody, future Duke of Pindar, would be present. It seemed probable since the Duke of Villiers\u2019s eldest son, Tobias, was best mates with Vander.</p> <p>As it turned out, the house was indeed overrun with boys on holiday from Eton and among the horde was Vander, who roundly ignored her. Mia didn\u2019t mind that: she was happy worshipping him from afar. He was too godlike for someone like her.</p><p>Besides, it wasn\u2019t as if he danced attendance on any other girl. He and the other Etonians spent their time swigging brandy although it was not yet noon, cursing loudly, and generally pretending to be far older than their fifteen years. Mia finally retreated to the library, a tranquil room with book-lined walls.</p><p>She was searching the shelves for anything resembling her favorite novel, Eliza Heywood\u2019s Love in Excess, when she heard, to her horror, the sound of boys approaching. Even worse, she quickly recognized the voices as those of Vander and his friend Tobias, who seemed to be calling himself Thorn these days.</p><p>The library was at the end of the corridor, so there was no escape. Panicked, Mia dashed behind the sofa and slid down until she was entirely concealed.</p><p>It was only then that she truly understood that she had entered that final, innermost circle of hell.</p><p>The boys were discussing a love poem.</p> <p>Not just any love poem, either.</p><p>They were puzzling over The Love Song of E. Septimus Brody\u2014in other words, a poem addressed explicitly to Vander\u2014that Mia herself had written. That she had poured her heart, her love, and her tears into.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t very good; none of her poems were very good.</p><p>Still, it was her poem, and it was supposed to be safely in her desk back home. Not being bandied about at a musicale. And definitely not in the hands of the very boy she\u2019d written it about.</p><p>Even in the midst of a wave of nausea, Mia guessed what had happened. Her father had found the poem and thought it would be amusing to share with his mistress, and his mistress had in turn shared it with her son. Mia had been such a fool to give it that title.</p><p>At least Vander wasn\u2019t howling with laughter, probably because he couldn\u2019t understand it. He and Thorn were hardly literary types, if a fifteen-year-old boy could be such a thing.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose the part about how moonbeams kiss the sea is some sort of innuendo?\u201d Thorn asked.</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. What an absurd suggestion. He probably still moved his lips when he read.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Vander answered, rather uncertainly. \u201cLet\u2019s toss it in the fire. I don\u2019t want anyone to see it.\u201d</p><p>She had scarcely breathed a sigh of relief when there was a clatter of boots and a boy shouted, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking all over for you fellows. One of the Villiers twins just threw up from nerves. It stinks down there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you were looking for us, Rotter,\u201d Vander stated, sounding all of a sudden like a future duke. \u201cWe told you last week that we wanted nothing more to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, no need to be nasty,\u201d the boy retorted, entirely unmoved by this set-down. \u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d To Mia\u2019s horror, the question was followed by the sound of a scuffle and tearing paper.</p><p>If Dante had conceived of a tenth circle of hell, this was it. Francis Oakenrott was a boy as rotten as his name implied. She had met him twice, at house parties her father dragged her along to. It was a case of mutual loathing-at-first-sight.</p><p>\u201cA love poem,\u201d he shouted, clearly delighted. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you\u2019ve taken up with an opera dancer with a literary bent. The headmaster will have your guts for garters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that,\u201d Vander snarled.</p><p>But Oakenrott apparently evaded capture. \u201cBlazing hell, this is utter rubbish!\u201d He broke into an escalating, barking laugh. Another thump followed. \u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake, back off and let me read it. It\u2019s too late to keep your little secret now. You\u2019d think you were ashamed.\u201d</p><p>Mia pulled a sofa pillow over her face with a silent groan. She wanted to die, to fall into a crack in the floor.</p><p>\u201cI am mad with love,\u201d Oakenrott recited, in a squeaky falsetto. \u201cYou know, I could see this on the stage. Have you been hanging about the back door of Drury Lane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s definitely cracked,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cWho could fancy a smelly, sweaty bloke like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just jealous,\u201d Vander retorted. \u201cShe\u2019d have to be barmy to look in your direction. Or Rotter\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who\u2019s the madwoman?\u201d Oakenrott said, paper rustling as he turned it over. \u201cEmilia Carrington? You mean the daughter of your mother\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Vander warned, his voice suddenly dangerous.</p><p>There was a telling moment of silence. \u201cRight. I\u2019ll just go back to this literary masterpiece. No one understands my plight,\u201d he read, his voice squealing even higher. \u201cI like this part about the moonbeam kissing the sea. Obviously, you have the moonbeam, and she\u2019s the sea.\u201d He went into another barking cascade of guffaws. A sob rose up Mia\u2019s chest, pressing so hard that pain shot through her breastbone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an ass,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cHow old is that girl, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same as me,\u201d Vander replied. \u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my dreams, you married me,\u201d Oakenrott said, reading from the beginning of the next stanza. A tear slid down Mia\u2019s neck. \u201cYour beauty makes me drunk.\u201d</p><p>Oakenrott hooted. Vander groaned.</p><p>She heard a hearty slap and then Thorn said, \u201cLook at it this way, at least you\u2019ve managed to charm a girl who knows a thing or two about brandy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as you do, after last night!\u201d Vander retorted.</p><p>Likely they were all drunken sots. Mia\u2019s governess had told her that boys pretending to be men drank far too much.</p><p>Oakenrott was relentless; he just wouldn\u2019t shut up. \u201cMy room is full of moonlight, and your eyes are like pearls.\u201d Do you suppose you\u2019re being invited to take your pearly eyes into her moonlit room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to grope my way,\u201d Vander said, and Mia could hear the laughter in his voice. \u201cNobody could see through pearly eyes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia\u2019s lips involuntarily shaped a curse word that she would never dare say aloud.</p><p>Oakenrott whistled. \u201cPearls? You know what kind of pearls she\u2019s really talking about, right? Pearl drops! Pearly potions, like we used to call it back in first form. No\u2014wasn\u2019t it pearly passion potions? Something like that. Anyway, this is the first poem I\u2019ve ever read that talked about love custard!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly all three boys were laughing hysterically.</p><p>\u201cLove custard\u201d? Mia hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what that meant, but she knew instinctively that it was something disgusting. Boys were disgusting by nature; she\u2019d temporarily forgotten that while pining for Vander. When she thought he was godlike.</p> <p>In reality he was a heartless pig.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t gotten under her skirts, have you?\u201d Oakenrott sounded gleeful at the prospect. \u201cHer father could take this line about being lost in your sweetness and pressure you to make an offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d Vander sounded so appalled that the word slid over Mia\u2019s skin like a snake. \u201cIt\u2019s a little odd to think that she\u2019s been lusting after me. What sort of fifteen-year-old girl thinks in these terms? Though I suppose she is her father\u2019s daughter.\u201d</p><p>Mia could hardly breathe because she was trying to sob without noise. He made her sound repulsive, saying that she was lusting after him. It wasn\u2019t like that. She wasn\u2019t like that.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever noticed her staring at you from the side of the room?\u201d Thorn asked. \u201cBecause here it says, Like the bird that gazes all night at the moon, I gaze at you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike a bird, or a Bird of Paradise?\u201d Oakenrott put in. \u201cMaybe she can set herself up as a literary light-skirt. One sovereign for a poem and two for a you-know-what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I can say is she\u2019s a God-awful poet,\u201d Vander said. \u201cEven I know that poems are supposed to rhyme.\u201d</p><p>What an idiot. Mia took a shuddering breath. She had to escape. She simply could not stand any more of this.</p><p>\u201cI think you should frame it,\u201d Thorn said, \u201cbecause I can tell you right now that no one else will think you\u2019re pretty enough to rhapsodize about. Especially given the size of your moonbeam.\u201d</p><p>That brought on a scuffle and more laughter. At her expense. Mia could feel the air rattling in her throat. Likely it was the death rattle. Maybe she would die, and they\u2019d find her body in this very spot.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I have to warn the fellows,\u201d Oakenrott said. \u201cSome bloke might be chatting with her right now, having no idea what a jam tart she is.\u201d</p> <p>Mia stiffened.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s like that at fifteen, what\u2019ll she be like at twenty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even jest about it. You\u2019d ruin her,\u201d Thorn said sharply. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poetry is evidence for the obvious,\u201d Oakenrott protested. \u201cShe\u2019s got a sluttish look about her. It\u2019s all there. Most girls that age have apple dumplings in front, but hers are more like cabbages than cherries!\u201d</p><p>Cabbages? Cabbages?</p><p>Mia stifled another sob. There was silence for a second, just long enough so that Mia could imagine Vander standing up for her, like a knight in shining armor. Growling, Shut your mouth, Oakenrott. She does not look sluttish.</p><p>That didn\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to issue warnings,\u201d Vander said flatly. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a fellow in this house who would bother speaking to that dumpy little thing. The only reason she was invited was that my mother brought along her lover, who dragged along his daughter. She\u2019s a charity case, that\u2019s what she is.\u201d</p> <p>A charity case. A dumpy one, at that.</p><p>She loathed him even more because he was right: she was dumpy. Other girls were tall and willowy, but she was \u201cpetite,\u201d which was just a pretentious way of saying that she was short.</p><p>And round. He meant she was fat.</p><p>He was a beast, a horrid beast.</p><p>Rage is a useful emotion. Rage burns away sorrow and disgrace. Rage propelled Mia to her feet, and she came out from around the sofa with her fists clenched.</p><p>Even knowing what he thought of her poem, despite her rage, the sight of Vander slammed into her. She had loved him too long to be unaffected by seeing him this close.</p><p>He was already tall and broad-shouldered. You could see the man he would someday be in the lineaments of his body and the strength of his jaw.</p><p>She looked at him up and down, curling her lip, and then gave his friends the same inspection.</p><p>Thorn looked horrified, and Oakenrott surprised, but Vander was utterly expressionless. All the things she\u2019d thought she\u2019d seen in him, every good characteristic that she had believed he had, the gentlemanly nature that seemed an antidote to her father\u2019s indiscretions . . . well, she must have made those traits up. There was nothing readable in his face, and clearly she had seen whatever she longed to find.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, thankfully discovering that her voice was steady. \u201cThree boys whose imaginations are so disgusting that they can read lechery into a silly love poem.\u201d She snatched the crumpled page from Thorn\u2019s hand and tore it in half. The sound seemed very loud in the otherwise silent room. She tore it again, and again, and dropped the pieces on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI may have made a fool of myself by falling in love,\u201d she told Vander, \u201cbut you have no right to ridicule me for it. Do you know that I was foolish enough to think you a gentleman, unlike\u2014\u201d She caught herself. Her father was her father, no matter his sins. \u201cI should have known better,\u201d she added. \u201cYou say I am my father\u2019s daughter. Well, you, Lord Brody, are obviously your mother\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>To her left, Thorn made a protesting movement but she swept him a glance and he shut his mouth.</p><p>Vander only stared at her. Why had she never noticed his beautiful eyes were hard and cold?</p><p>\u201cI shall now take myself and my cabbages into the drawing room,\u201d she said, head high, though it took every ounce of willpower she could summon to hold it there. \u201cIf you would do me the courtesy to remain here for fifteen minutes, I shall find my father and be gone.\u201d</p><p>None of them said a word, the pestilent cowards.</p><p>One more thing occurred to her. \u201cMoreover, I wouldn\u2019t marry a single one of you,\u201d she said, making her voice as scathing as she could, \u201ceven if I were desperate! Even if you were the only men left in all England!\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Thirteen years later</p><p>From the offices of Brandy, Bucknell &amp; Bendal, Publishers</p><p>August 27, 1800</p><p>Dear Miss Carrington,</p><p>I am writing to inquire about the prospect of receiving your new novel. As you know, we had hoped to receive the manuscript some six months ago. We are all most sympathetic as regards the tragic death of your father and brother a year ago. But I would be remiss not to tell you that letters begging for Miss Lucibella Delicosa\u2019s next novel are piling up in our offices. Your title, An Angel\u2019s Form and a Devil\u2019s Heart, has proved so enticing that subscriptions already exceed sales of your last two novels added together.</p><p>With deep respect, and anticipating a favorable reply,</p><p>I remain,</p><p>William Bucknell, Esq.</p><p>P.S. I am including Miss Julia Quiplet\u2019s latest novel.

She generally put her poor ladies in Mortal Danger, standing at the brink of icy waters, for example, pursued by a lustful landlord, knees knocking pitiably and delicate hands shaking.</p> <p>Her readers expected Mortal Danger. In capital letters.</p><p>She\u2019d happily choose a plunge over a waterfall to the humiliation that lay ahead of her.</p><p>Her own less-than-delicate hands were trembling, so she curled them into fists, watching as her groom announced her name. Vander\u2019s butler\u2014or, to be exact, the Duke of Pindar\u2019s butler\u2014glanced down at her, patently surprised that a young lady had arrived without a chaperone.</p><p>Did intense humiliation count as Mortal Danger?</p><p>No, because if it were possible to die of humiliation, she would surely be dead by now. After all, she had survived the mortifying poetry incident in Villiers\u2019s library all those years ago, then she\u2019d failed on the marriage market, only to go through an even worse humiliation: being jilted at the altar a month ago.</p> <p>The truth was that as an author she was always kind to her characters. Mortal Danger never included jiltings. What\u2019s more, thanks to her heroines\u2019 thin, wispy bodies, they always floated safely downstream, too light to sink. Another author she knew had caused a character to die after an eagle dropped a tortoise on his head. Murder by tortoise?</p><p>Not in a Lucibella novel!</p><p>Her readers knew that there would be no bloodthirsty birds, no one left at the altar. She had never forced any of her heroines to propose marriage, let alone to a duke.</p><p>Gentlemen fell at her heroines\u2019 feet, not the other way around. It was a strict requirement of the genre. Lord knows, Lucibella Delicosa disappointed her readers at her own peril: a torrent of indignant letters would pour through her publisher\u2019s door if she were to shame one of her heroines the way Mia was about to be shamed.</p><p>But at least, Mia reminded herself, she was not, in reality, falling at Vander\u2019s feet.</p><p>She was in charge.</p> <p>In control.</p><p>Before she could think better of it, she took a deep breath, handed her pelisse to the butler, and marched past him into the morning room. Mia had spent a good deal of time in the ducal country estate as a young girl, given the late duchess\u2019 decades-long affaire with her father, and she knew where she was headed.</p><p>Even though the principal players in that drama\u2014her father and Vander\u2019s mother\u2014had passed away, it seemed nothing had changed in the manor house. Every horizontal surface was still crowded with animal figurines, evidence of the late duchess\u2019 fascination with small creatures.</p><p>She turned to the butler. \u201cPlease let His Grace know that my call shall be quite brief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall ascertain whether His Grace is receiving,\u201d he said, and left.</p><p>Surely Vander would see her? How could he deny her, given their parents\u2019 relationship? Commonsense reminded her that he might well deny her for that precise reason.</p><p>She wandered over to look at the glass menagerie that resided on the mantelpiece. The unicorn had lost his horn, but all the animals were still there, silently poised with a paw up or a tail waving\u2014some with little animal families, as though they had paired off and multiplied while the house slept.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t concentrate on the little curl of glass, a tadpole, she picked up. The thought of what lay ahead of her\u2014the marriage proposal\u2014made her feel dizzy, as if her corset was constricting her chest and making it hard to breathe. Years before, when she\u2019d vowed to Vander\u2019s face never to marry him, a gleam of amusement had sprung to his eyes.</p> <p>What if he burst out laughing now?</p><p>She was not exquisitely beautiful, refined, intelligent . . . and she didn\u2019t even have a fortune. Whoever heard of a wallflower asking a duke for his hand in marriage?</p><p>Mia took another deep breath. She wasn\u2019t precisely asking the duke to marry her. That would be pitiful. She was blackmailing him, which was altogether different.</p><p>More swashbuckling. More perilous.</p><p>More criminal.</p><p>She should pretend this wasn\u2019t happening to her, but to one of her heroines, the way she did with almost everything else. She already had plenty of practice observing her life as if from outside. She regularly chatted with patently bored gentlemen, simultaneously rewriting the conversation in such a way that a fantastically idealized version of herself left them dumbstruck with desire.</p><p>Back home she would jot down the scene precisely as she had reimagined it\u2014giving herself violet eyes and a slim waist. Sometimes she stayed up all night describing the adventures of one of her heroines, a girl so well-mannered, biddable, and pure of heart that only the most discerning readers noticed she was quite intelligent.</p><p>In contrast, men noticed that Mia was intelligent, but it seemed to put them off.</p><p>If life imitated one of her novels, Vander would stride into the room and after one glance begin wooing her with such passion that the distasteful question of blackmail would never need be mentioned.</p><p>His blue eyes would flare with possessive fervor. For the rest of his life, His Grace would regret the thirteen years he might have spent with her, but had lost due to his callow and callous blindness as a boy. He would bitterly reproach himself for his cruel insults.</p><p>Unfortunately, that was more than unlikely. In Mia\u2019s experience, people never regretted clever insults, no matter how much they might sting the recipient.</p><p>She hated cabbage to this day. As well as Oakenrott.</p><p>A queer numbness came over her. She, Emilia Gwendolyn Carrington, was about to coerce a duke into marrying her. An old maid in her twenties, possessed of neither violet-colored eyes nor a slender waist, was\u2014</p><p>This was not a helpful train of thought.</p><p>She had to stop trembling. The proposal wasn\u2019t for her benefit. Nor was it for an extended period of time. She simply needed Vander to marry her in name only, for a year at most. It was the only way she could take guardianship of her nephew, Charles Wallace.</p><p>Nephew? In all the ways that counted, Charlie was her son. Her own child.</p><p>She took a deep breath. Women dove from the decks of tall ships to save children fallen overboard. They fought tigers and wild boars.</p><p>What was a mere duke compared to a man-eating carnivore? She\u2019d heard some creatures had such large teeth that they could be hollowed out and used as soup ladles.</p><p>Right.</p><p>The tricky part was that Mr. Plummer, her solicitor, had been adamant that the duke could not be informed of the reasons for her proposal, or His Grace would almost certainly say no.</p><p>By marrying her, the duke not only took on guardianship of a small boy; he gained control of an extremely large estate running adjacent to his, which would look highly suspicious to his peers. Their marriage would be a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre without even taking into account the scandals caused by their parents: Vander would undoubtedly face a lawsuit charging him with theft of the estate from Charlie\u2019s uncle on his mother\u2019s side, Sir Richard Magruder.</p><p>Vander\u2014His Grace, the Duke of Pindar\u2014was just another supercilious, privileged, silly man, she reminded herself. He wasn\u2019t a tiger with soup ladles for teeth.</p><p>She could do this.</p><p>She must do this.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>NOTES ON An Angel\u2019s Form and a Devil\u2019s Heart: a Novel</p><p>Heroine is slender, ethereal, willowy . . . another way to say thin?

Then he realized it had to be Mia, the hapless poet. His complete avoidance of polite society in favor of the stables meant that he hadn\u2019t seen her in years.</p><p>\u201cDid she give any indication of the reason for her visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Your Grace. She is in the morning room, should you wish to speak to her, or I can inform her that you are busy at this time. I might add that she is unaccompanied. Furthermore, your solicitor is in the library. He has been waiting some time and is becoming impatient.\u201d</p> <p>The last time he could remember having seen Mia was that bloody embarrassing thing that happened when they were fifteen.</p><p>What in the hell was she thinking, calling on him early in the morning, without a chaperone? Why call on him at all?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go to Miss Carrington,\u201d he decided, heading from his bedchamber. He owed the poet an audience, if only because he should have handled that situation better. The very memory made him shudder a little. He had been stupid and young, but even so, he\u2019d behaved like an ass.</p><p>Vander strode down the stairs adjusting his cuffs. Mia\u2019s name must have been as besmirched as his by their parents\u2019 deaths a year ago. There was no covering up the fact that the Duchess of Pindar had died in bed with Lord Carrington. All of England knew about the damaged stove flue that had led to their deaths: that flare of scandal had eclipsed the deaths of eight other unfortunates sleeping in the same inn\u2014a list that had included Mia\u2019s brother and sister-in-law, if he remembered correctly. It must have been a terrible year for her.</p><p>Just as he reached the final step, his solicitor, Grieg, erupted from the library and accosted him. Vander almost groaned aloud as he listened. Apparently, Sir Cuthbert had made a rash promise to finance an archaeological expedition to the Andes Mountains.</p><p>Insofar as his uncle\u2019s sole source of income was the allowance Vander gave him, which Chuffy promptly spent on velvet coats and bottles of sack, he wasn\u2019t in a position to make good on the promise. It seemed that Chuffy had got around that little problem by scrawling a note promising that the Duke of Pindar would back the expedition.</p> <p>He would have to tell Chuffy that his funds were tied up in his stables and he could not finance an expedition to the Andes at this time. Or, for that matter, ever.</p><p>The primary thing he remembered about Mia Carrington was that she had a chubby face and magnificent breasts.</p><p>All these years later, her face was thinner. Presumably her breasts were still there, but she was wearing a drab gown of homespun that concealed everything below her chin. She looked like a missionary. Perhaps she\u2019d become one?</p><p>He felt a flash of sympathy. Her religious leanings, if she had them, were likely a response to their parents\u2019 blatant disregard for the sanctity of marriage. Though if she had come to try to proselytize\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, dropping a curtsy. \u201cHow very wonderful to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Was that a drop of sarcasm in her voice? Surely not. After all, she was the one who had come, uninvited, to his house, not the other way around.</p><p>He bowed. When he straightened, he found that she was observing him, gloved hands folded, with the air of someone watching a play.</p><p>Peculiar.</p> <p>\u201cMiss Carrington, what can I do for you?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cI have come to request a favor.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s shoulders relaxed. This missionary woman had likely joined a mission in an effort to atone for her licentious father\u2019s sins. She wanted a contribution. He was accustomed to solicitations: virtually everyone in his life except his friend Thorn had asked him for money at some point. It was part and parcel of being a duke.</p><p>A donation was a perfect way to assuage the last of that inconvenient guilt he felt due to hurting her feelings years ago.</p><p>\u201cI would be most happy to help,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you care to be seated? I could ring for tea if you wish.\u201d</p><p>She stood as still as a tree, only her hands twisting together. \u201cYou might not feel inclined to be generous after you\u2019ve heard my request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only on the basis of having known you since childhood, I assure you that I will agree to whatever sort of help you wish.\u201d He gave her a measured smile, wondering how quickly he could bundle her out of the room. His secretary could hand over the actual sovereigns. \u201cHow much would you like?\u201d</p><p>She had a quite delicate jaw. He noticed because it visibly tightened, as if she were grinding her teeth. As a child, she used to be shaped like a stout pigeon, with a little potbelly and legs that whirled across the lawn as she tried to keep up with him.</p><p>Not that she ever could.</p><p>\u201cMiss Carrington,\u201d he prompted, when she didn\u2019t answer, \u201cI gather that you are collecting for a charity, and I assure you that I will contribute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her jaw tightening again. \u201cI came to ask for something quite different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy to assist you,\u201d he said, allowing a trace of impatience to leak into his voice.</p><p>\u201cMarriage,\u201d she blurted out, and took a gulp of air.</p><p>He stared at her for one perfectly silent moment.</p><p>\u201cI should like you to marry me.\u201d She said it fast and the words ran together.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am proposing marriage,\u201d she stated. Then she closed her mouth.</p><p>Vander had to curb an impulse to shake his head to make sure he had heard correctly. The woman must be touched, though madness ran in his family, not in hers.</p><p>But mad she must be, because she was looking at him expectantly, for all the world as if she thought there was a possibility he took her seriously.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cWell, how kind of you to offer.\u201d Surely this was some sort of ruse? \u201cHowever, I regret to inform you that I have no intention to marry at this time.\u201d</p><p>Something crossed her face\u2014disappointment? Was that possible?</p><p>\u201cI suppose you think I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m afraid that I am, a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Vander was, against all expectations, starting to enjoy himself. After all, her family had ruined his. Her father\u2019s seduction of his mother had made the Duchess of Pindar the laughingstock of the ton.</p><p>And now Carrington\u2019s daughter had the temerity to think that he would consider marrying her? Truly, the family had balls.</p><p>Even the women.</p><p>\u201cSo you are looking for a husband,\u201d he said agreeably. \u201cAnd you thought, hey ho, I\u2019ll have a go at a duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not kind of you,\u201d she said, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>Her eyes were a remarkable green, with thick eyelashes. Not that their color made her in the least attractive; rather the opposite. He preferred women with melting blue eyes. Eyes like the sky in summer.</p><p>\u201cI must insist that you be seated,\u201d he said. \u201cWooing is such an arduous business, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>After a long second she moved to a chair opposite his, and damned if she didn\u2019t try again. \u201cWill you marry me, Your Grace?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d The words shot out like a bullet. \u201cGiven our family history, you are the last woman in the world I\u2019d marry. In fact, I believe that you expressed the same sentiment to me some years ago, and I cannot imagine what has changed your mind.\u201d</p><p>She was unbalanced. There was no other explanation for a woman\u2019s proposing to a duke, let alone imagining that he would accept. She suffered from delusions.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly imagine the scandal that a marriage between us would cause,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI am aware that our union would be a subject of speculation,\u201d she said, for all the world as if they were discussing the weather. \u201cI try not to let gossip bother me. Besides, I have come to view our parents\u2019 relationship as something of a star-crossed tragedy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, all right,\u201d he drawled. \u201cYour bastard of a father seduced my mother, made her into a whore, and ruined my family name.\u201d</p><p>Her grip tightened on the arms of her chair, but she showed no other sign of being intimidated. \u201cOur parents loved each other, Your Grace. Their union was not sanctioned by society, but to the best of my observation, it was positively tedious in its domesticity. If not for the accident that took their lives, I am certain that they would have spent the next forty years together.\u201d</p><p>Vander suppressed a shudder. He had loathed Carrington as no other man. He\u2019d worn his hatred for so long it had become comfortable, and he had no interest in reappraising the way it fit.</p><p>For years, he had made damned sure that he and Carrington were never found in the same residence, even if he had to bed down in the stables.</p><p>Which meant that he hadn\u2019t seen his mother for months before her death.</p> <p>A stab of guilt made his tone harsher than he intended. \u201cMiss Carrington, I cannot imagine why you believe I would consider your request, let alone agree to it. When\u2014if\u2014I decide to marry, I will both choose the woman, and propose to her myself.\u201d</p><p>Damn it\u2014this was absurd. He had no mistress at the moment, but if he had, anyone in England would guess that she wouldn\u2019t be a short, round woman dressed like a missionary.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell do you come to me, of all people, with this request?\u201d he asked, with genuine curiosity. \u201cThere are a million men in England whom you could marry, if you have determined to go against custom and do your own wooing. Though, to be perfectly candid, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Under her dreadful gown, he\u2019d guess that she was as lush as she had been at fifteen. Voluptuous, even. If she put her assets on display, she could probably marry almost anyone she wanted. He might prefer the tall, willowy type, but he knew plenty of men who preferred a pocket Venus.</p><p>Beyond which, it wasn\u2019t her mother who had been an adulteress. Far less shame attached to a man who made a duchess his mistress.</p><p>\u201cYou have a dowry, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, since she hadn\u2019t responded to his previous question. Her family\u2019s lands ran adjacent to his ducal seat, so he would have heard if there were obvious problems. Last he heard, Sir Richard Magruder was running the estate because the Carrington heir was underage. Sir Richard was not a man he admired, but he\u2019d probably do an adequate job.</p> <p>\u201cI have a dowry.\u201d She hesitated for a moment, then took a deep breath and pulled a sheet of yellowed paper, folded many times into a small square, out of her reticule. \u201cI also have this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Vander said with a groan. \u201cNot another poem. I\u2019m not a literary fellow, Miss Carrington. You can\u2019t change my mind with a lyric.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flamed a surprisingly lovely shade of red. \u201cI would never\u2014\u201d She caught herself and started over. \u201cNo, it is not a poem. It\u2019s a letter.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, a drop of ice sliding down his spine as a realization hit him. \u201cYou intend to blackmail me? I suppose that is some revolting piece of tripe that my mother addressed to your father.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and took one stride forward, leaning over and bracing his hands on the armchair. \u201cPublish and be damned, Miss Carrington. Publish, and go to hell while you do it.\u201d</p><p>She was staring at her hands and didn\u2019t look at him, even though he was leaning so close to her that he almost touched her forehead. He caught a delicate whiff of honeysuckle\u2014an unexpected scent for someone thoroughly swathed in thick wool.</p><p>\u201cI gather you planned to force me to marry you?\u201d He spoke through clenched teeth, enraged by his body\u2019s disturbing response to being close to her. \u201cTo hell with that. Take care you get a premium from whatever Grub Street hack buys your letter, because I give you fair warning: I shall ruin you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wish to read the document first?\u201d She finally met his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s fulsome nature practically guarantees that the letter is full of drivel. Moonbeams and pearls, I expect?\u201d</p><p>She flinched and her face grew even paler. But she was as brave as he remembered. She cleared her throat and looked him full in the face again. \u201cThe letter was not written by your mother, but by your father,\u201d she corrected him.</p><p>This was a surprise, but he said, \u201cMy father spent most of his adult life confined to a private asylum, a fact you know as well as I do. I doubt you\u2019ll get more than five pounds for publishing one of his rants.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said. \u201cI implore you to read the letter.\u201d</p><p>Vander stared at her for one second longer, before he took it from her and straightened, falling back a step. The letter was definitely from the late duke; Vander could recognize his hand anywhere. It was dated long before his father had been declared insane, but his handwriting belied that fact.</p><p>When his father was suffering from a mad fit, his writing reflected his state of mind. The script hurtled across the page, the letters slanted as if blown by a stiff wind. There had been weeks when twenty- or thirty-page letters arrived from the asylum, each page urgent, demanding . . . incoherent.</p><p>He read the letter.</p><p>He read it three more times, then carefully folded it back up.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll take my title and estate if you publish this.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were grave, not at all triumphant. \u201cI believe you are correct.\u201d</p><p>Vander felt light-headed. \u201cSo my father was a traitor to the Crown.\u201d He\u2019d believed his family had hit rock bottom when his mother died in Carrington\u2019s arms; it turned out that there was a further drop. Madness, adultery\u2014and now treason.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt he could have assassinated the king, even if he had mailed this offer. My father had no entr\u00e9e to the court. As I understand it, everyone avoided him even during his schooldays; his feelings were too extreme and unpredictable to make him easy company.\u201d</p><p>His mind was reeling from the blow. His dukedom was the key to everything that mattered to him: his stables, his estate, his cottagers. Everything would be forfeit to the Crown. After the debacle of his childhood, and the scandals his parents caused, his horses were his life.</p><p>Words shot from his mouth without conscious volition. Swear words, rough oaths that he had never used in the presence of a lady.</p><p>But was she a lady?</p><p>No. She was a damned blackmailer.</p><p>Her mouth tightened, though she was pretending not to hear him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDespite this letter, you can\u2019t possibly think that I will agree to marry you.\u201d For a second control eluded him, but he reined it back in.

The whole of her.</p><p>\u201cI do not consider a proposal of marriage to be an embarrassment,\u201d she said untruthfully, fighting to keep her voice from rising into a squeak. \u201cI am in possession of a special license, and I would like to marry quite soon.\u201d</p><p>Instead of thunder, she got another crack of laughter, sharpened by rage. \u201cYou have to be joking. You think I would marry you?\u201d His eyes raked her from head to toe.</p><p>She fell silent, swallowing hard. She tried not to think about her attractiveness\u2014or lack thereof\u2014and most of the time she was successful.</p><p>\u201cYou are not joking.\u201d He didn\u2019t move a finger, but she felt danger in the very air, as if he might turn and smash his fist straight through the window if he lost control of his temper. He had already uttered some words she\u2019d never heard before.</p><p>She forced herself to speak. \u201cMy solicitor obtained the license. I hoped we could marry in a few days. At the least, within the week, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnbelievable. I\u2019ve asked you repeatedly, and I\u2019ll ask again. Why do you want to marry me, Miss Carrington? Is it a matter of ambition?</p> <p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Vander continued, not waiting for a response. \u201cYou\u2019re getting revenge for the poetry episode all those years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! The subject is irrelevant.\u201d Mia pulled another folded sheet from her reticule. \u201cYou may keep the letter written by your father, Your Grace. I took the liberty of putting into writing my specifications as regards our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Specifications?\u2019\u201d Vander echoed.</p><p>He felt as if he had fallen into another world. Ladies did not propose marriage. They did not issue \u201cspecifications\u201d for male behavior, within marriage or without.</p><p>\u201cThe terms of our marriage.\u201d She put the document on a side table. \u201cHere they are.\u201d</p><p>Vander took a step forward and caught her wrist. It was shockingly small. \u201cThis makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull free, but it was no use; he had restrained horses that were far taller than she was and weighed ten times as much. \u201cAre you ambitious for social status? Or did your father put you up to this before he died?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes skittered away, and he realized the truth with a sickening thud. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I didn\u2019t even ask how you got that damned letter. He stole it, didn\u2019t he? Or my mother gave it to him. It wasn\u2019t enough to drag my mother into the gutter and shame my father\u2014Carrington made sure that he would befoul the Pindar line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefoul?\u201d She stopped struggling to free herself and stared up at him with an absurd air of innocence.</p><p>\u201cTaint my blood,\u201d he said, wanting to hurt her. \u201cI think anyone would agree that children of your family will sully the ducal line. My father expected me to marry into the best of families, Miss Carrington. Your father was not ennobled by his association with my mother. Quite the opposite.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cMay I remind you that you\u2019re talking about sullying a ducal line headed by a madman and\u2014\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d he said, his voice dangerously low. \u201cBy what word would you characterize my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should not be having this discussion, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>This time he snatched both of her hands and reeled her close to him before she could do more than gasp. \u201cI think the word you were looking for is whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, and you should not speak about your mother that way,\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, you shouldn\u2019t even speak that word in my presence!\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s grip tightened. \u201cYou don\u2019t make an outcry when I curse, yet I say the word \u2018whore\u2019 and you squeal like an insulted nun? Who are you, really, Mia Carrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all those things you\u2019ve called me, Your Grace,\u201d she said steadily. \u201cA wallflower, an old maid, a charity case. A desperate woman in need of a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA husband?\u201d He looked her up and down. \u201cIn your bed? Is that what this is about?\u201d</p><p>Red flashed through her cheeks. So that was it. She still lusted after him, which should make him laugh. But this close, he could feel the warmth coming from her lush little body.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to look at her eyes; they made him feel odd, unbalanced. With one swift movement, he turned her about so that she was snug against his front, his arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>She fit in the circle of his arms perfectly, so perfectly that he pulled her even closer, before he realized what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cDo you imagine that you and I will have the sort of relationship that our parents had?\u201d he asked. He spread his right hand over her stomach, pulling her tightly against him so that she could not mistake the reaction of his body to hers. He was still hard as a rock and had been since he loomed over her in the chair.</p><p>She was no lady, and he refused to do her the courtesy of treating her like one. What he wanted to do was act like a man who had never heard of civilized society: bend her over that chair and take her.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d she demanded. He heard no fear in her voice, so he ignored her protest.</p><p>\u201cIf I want a whore, I pay for her,\u201d he said, thrusting forward with his hips in a rough motion that she could not mistake. \u201cI don\u2019t marry the woman. Your father didn\u2019t bother with such formalities, so why should you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond other than continuing to struggle to pull away, her head bent forward and her hair falling from its pins. Vander had a discomforting feeling that perhaps he was the one more affected by their position. For some damn reason, her body was practically burning him, and he felt as if he were surrounded by her soft elusive scent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He had never felt like this: dizzy with raw lust, hungry to take her and prove\u2014</p><p>With an oath, he released her and backed away, as if that would save him from the hunger that had him wanting to throw her on a bed, any bed, and tuck her body beneath his own.</p><p>She turned around slowly. Pale gold ribbons of hair fell around her neck and curled against the drab fabric of her gown. It sent another shock through him.</p><p>\u201cYour mother was not a whore,\u201d she repeated, as fierce as ever. \u201cShe was in love with my father. It\u2019s not fair to brand her that way!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe may not have been, but her son will be. After all, you\u2019re buying my services, are you not? The market price for one duke, in fairly good physical condition, seems to be an incriminatory letter. Perhaps you should search your father\u2019s belongings. Just think what you could do with two such letters. Two noblemen, in the same bed, at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a loathsome thing to say,\u201d she said, her voice shaking for the first time.</p><p>He plowed his hands through his hair, frustration mixing with his lust. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a dowry, if that\u2019s the problem.\u201d He was grasping at straws, he knew. \u201cI can make you rich enough that you can attract a man by conventional means. You needn\u2019t do this, Miss Carrington. We can forget it ever happened.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed at him, her chin back up in the air. \u201cYou think I couldn\u2019t possibly attract a husband without a large dowry?\u201d</p><p>Vander eyed her truly awful gown. \u201cIf you bought some reasonably fashionable frocks, I\u2019m sure that you could find someone,\u201d he offered. \u201cHell, I could help there too. I know several gentlemen who\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho are desperate enough to marry someone like me if a duke paid them enough?\u201d she cut in.</p><p>He eyed her, then shrugged.</p><p>She went stiff all over, like a Greek statue sculpted by the hand of a master. But she likely had a lushly feminine grace when unclothed, a figure that those stalk-thin Greek goddesses would envy. Put it together with lips of deep rose, and those eyes . . . she could certainly have a man at her feet. Maybe a whole crowd.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t be one of them.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately for your scheme, I already have a dowry,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is sufficiently large. Moreover, I have . . . I have money of my own.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cIn that case, why in the bloody hell are you forcing this? You say it isn\u2019t revenge. Or lust. God knows our marriage would be a disaster.\u201d And then it sank in, well and truly seeping in like a stinging poison. \u201cMiss Carrington, you have to trust that there\u2019s someone out there who would fall in love with you in return. You don\u2019t really love me. You don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, my closest friend Thorn\u2014Tobias Dautry\u2014never thought to marry. He fell in love just this last year, as unexpectedly as if he\u2019d been hit on the head by a cannon ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove is like being hit in the head?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, warming to the subject. \u201cWhat if that were to happen to you? When it happens to you,\u201d he amended. \u201cWhen you meet the man of your dreams, you will be desolate if you and I are already married.\u201d</p><p>The sensual, plump curve of her lips tightened into a thin line, suggesting he was making an impression. \u201cThere\u2019s no possible way that our marriage will thrive,\u201d he continued. \u201cNot under any circumstances. Hell, I courted Lady Xenobia last year. One of the most beautiful women in all London, perhaps in all Britain. And the daughter of a marquess.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cIndia is tall and willowy,\u201d he said, forcing the issue. \u201cExquisitely beautiful, with the bearing of a goddess.\u201d Never mind the fact that he\u2019d decided India was a bit too tall for him.</p><p>\u201cWe are both already aware of what you think of me, Your Grace,\u201d Mia replied, her chin held high and shoulders back, for all the world as if she were facing a judge. \u201cYou labeled me a dumpy charity case years ago, before I emerged from behind Villiers\u2019s sofa.\u201d</p> <p>Actually, what he remembered was her bravery. There had been more than one time when he might have turned away from a challenge, but he remembered little Mia charging around the sofa.</p><p>\u201cYour waxing on about love has not changed my mind, nor have your insults.\u201d She picked up her reticule and headed for the door. \u201cPlease excuse me.\u201d</p><p>With two long strides he was past her, blocking the door. Her green eyes were dark and misty: she wasn\u2019t as unmoved as she had sounded.</p><p>\u201cYou must give up this mad idea,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Mia took a deep breath. She was trying desperately to think how to respond. Her solicitor had made blackmail sound easy. Wave the letter, and the duke will realize that he has no option, and must meet your requirements.</p><p>It was all different now, in the event, when she was actually faced by Vander. She hated doing this. She felt miserable and low, battered by his rage and distaste. But rather than give in, she made herself think of sweet little Charlie. And his uncle, the horrendous Sir Richard.</p><p>The thought steadied her, and she managed to hold back her tears. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she repeated. \u201cBut I must marry you.\u201d</p><p>A muscle worked in Vander\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cMy expectations for the marriage are enumerated on the document I left on the table,\u201d she stated, keeping her voice steady through some miracle. \u201cI ask for very little,\u201d she added. \u201cPlease, Your Grace, just . . . just do me this favor.\u201d</p><p>Vander wasn\u2019t listening; she could tell. The flare in his eyes would have burned her, if such a thing was possible.</p><p>He reached out for her and like any silly rabbit, she froze.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re to be my wife, I might as well have a taste of you,\u201d he said, raw and low.</p><p>But before she could say anything else, his mouth came down on hers and he forced her lips to open.</p><p>It was an angry kiss, a vengeful kiss.</p><p>When Mia had been betrothed to Edward Reeve, son of the Earl of Gryffyn, she had enjoyed his kisses. Edward had been respectful and never strayed beyond the bounds of propriety . . . or not far.</p><p>During the months of their betrothal, while they waited for her mourning period to end, there were times when he kissed her until she was flushed and giggling.</p><p>That was before he\u2019d jilted her, of course.</p><p>This kiss of Vander\u2019s had nothing in common with Edward\u2019s. When Vander slanted his mouth over hers, Mia felt a shock of heat so acute that her scalp prickled.</p><p>His tongue slid into her mouth and his big body shoved against hers with none of the gentlemanly restraint that her fianc\u00e9 had shown. Mia felt as if she\u2019d been thrown into a river without the ability to swim.</p><p>Every point at which he touched her felt a glaze of fire, a small ache. Her mouth opened wider, inviting him in, and she tipped her head to give him greater access. Her mind went blank and her hands stopped pushing at his chest and encircled his neck. The brush of silky hair against her fingers set a fever blazing in her stomach.</p><p>Trembling, her eyes closed, she didn\u2019t notice at first when Vander pulled away. Not until the arm holding her against the door dropped, and she landed with a jolt that rattled her teeth.</p><p>If only she\u2019d kept her eyes closed.</p><p>The contempt in his eyes was warring with pity, and she didn\u2019t know which was worse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vander reached out and tilted her chin up. \u201cYou can\u2019t force a man to love you, Mia.\u201d The words were rough but there was softness there too, pity for the old maid who had no way to get a husband except by blackmailing him. And he used her personal name, as if he were her big brother offering counsel.</p><p>Mia drew in a breath of air that scorched her lungs, as if it burned from the inside out. Could this be any more humiliating? Once they married, she would take Charlie and go live in Scotland.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a difficult lesson. You simply have to trust that in time you\u2019ll love someone else,\u201d Vander added, looking sorry.</p><p>Sorry for her.</p> <p>Scotland wasn\u2019t far enough.</p><p>Bavaria. She and Charlie would go to Bavaria, where no one knew them. Charlie could return to England at age eighteen and reclaim the Carrington estate from Vander.</p><p>At least she knew that he would have an estate to inherit, if Vander was in charge. Sir Richard would waste it all in frivolous lawsuits, with no regard for Charlie\u2019s patrimony.</p><p>Mr. Plummer could help Vander petition the House of Lords for a divorce in her absence; he would take care of everything. She herself need never return to England.</p><p>Vander\u2019s eyes were intent on hers. \u201cTell me to destroy the letter, Mia. Keep your dignity and your self-respect. Don\u2019t make me hate you.\u201d</p> <p>He had no idea how much she wanted to keep her self-respect. Her dignity was gone . . . but her decency? She shuddered, knowing what she would think of a woman who had acted as she had. Villainesses in her books always came to a bad end.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Mia looked regretful . . . but Vander could tell that she didn\u2019t have the faintest intention of freeing him. She was determined to tie him to her apron strings. Or perhaps bedpost was more accurate.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have the faintest idea what a man needed, what a man would demand of his wife. To put it bluntly, she was an old maid without the faintest understanding of what really went on between men and women: the sweaty, grunting, pleasurable truth of it. Anger filled him again, like water coming to a boil.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re getting my moonbeam, Mia? Whatever you want to call it, I can assure you that it will not perform under these circumstances. Not when you\u2019ve commanded the act. We men are odd that way. We like to choose our bed partners. And if you\u2019ll forgive my bluntness, I would not choose you.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flooded with color again. \u201cMy poem had nothing to do with that\u2014with, with intimate matters!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d Vander tore off his coat and tossed it behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He started on his waistcoat, her eyes going wide as he tossed that aside too. This time he heard a tinkle of broken glass.</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should see what blackmailing a man does to his cock? Excuse me: to his moon-beam?\u201d</p><p>His hands moved to his waistband and undid the first button. At the same moment, the combination of Mia\u2019s wide eyes, luscious bosom, and that kiss wrapped around him. He felt his body grow hard.</p><p>In fact, his cock was about as stiff as it had ever been.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he muttered. That ruined his initial plan. Never mind: he could shock her into realizing that marriage wasn\u2019t poetic, but sweaty and real.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Vander ran a hand slowly down the front of his breeches and sure enough, her eyes followed the movement. Mia likely believed that wedding vows had some sort of romantic power to them. Hell, she had spun a fairy tale around the dissolute relationship their parents had shared.</p><p>She had probably read too many of those novels, the ones full of tripe about gentlemen who behaved as no man ever would, falling on their knees from one moment to the next. Begging for a woman the way a spaniel would a bone.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is showing you every inch of what you wrote about in that damned poem,\u201d he said, baring his teeth in an approximation of a smile. He undid another button, his breeches straining in front.</p><p>He expected her to squeak like a mouse and dash from the room. Ladies did that sort of thing to avoid reality.</p><p>But Mia surprised him. Again. \u201cIs there something I am supposed to be noticing?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>For a moment he almost admired her. He wasn\u2019t boastful, but he knew he was large\u2014all over. Seasoned courtesans had looked shocked at the size of his rod.</p><p>Not her.</p><p>For someone who was going to all the trouble of threatening his dukedom in order to climb into his bed, Mia seemed astonishingly nonchalant.</p><p>Button number three.</p><p>\u201cYou stop what you\u2019re doing this instant!\u201d she said, finally looking a bit unnerved. Her voice had taken on a husky lisp that only made him harder.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that you don\u2019t want to assess the merchandise? Really, Mia, you must learn to conduct yourself in the marketplace. Vendors always want to display their wares.\u201d</p><p>At that, her back stiffened. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason gentlemen keep such details to themselves,\u201d she flashed. \u201cYou, for example, seem to have delusions of . . . of adequacy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I have a conviction,\u201d he drawled. \u201cOf grandeur.\u201d With every button he undid, with every sign of her determination, he felt anger swelling in his throat, threatening to strangle him, making him behave more and more outrageously.</p><p>He courted danger, not women. He had sometimes talked vaguely about a wife but now he realized with abrupt clarity that he didn\u2019t want one.</p><p>Every ounce of his being resisted the idea, screaming at him to fight in the only way he could fathom in this insane circumstance. He undid the final button and his tool sprang free, shielded from her eyes only by the thin silk of his smalls.</p><p>\u201cSo, Miss Carrington, does the moonbeam live up to expectations?\u201d</p><p>For a second, he could have sworn her green eyes darkened, but in the next, she folded her arms over her chest. \u201cAs I recall, when you were merely fifteen, your closest friends were already expressing some concern about your size.\u201d</p><p>Surprise ripped through him, and he gave a bark of laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat I see, Your Grace, is a man who has the good sense to celebrate what Nature gave him, overlooking Her stinginess!\u201d</p><p>Vander grinned, the surprising thought that few people were capable of verbally sparring with him flashing through his brain. He was about to respond, but he realized that Mia was feeling behind her for the latch. Instantly he dragged her to him, bucking his hips against her body. Then he slid his hands down her back and splayed his fingers over her bottom, holding her tight against him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but a sound escaped her lips, a little puff of air that sent an answering shudder through his body.</p><p>He had made another mistake. He had just played into her hands. What was he thinking? This woman had been writing sensual poems at fifteen. She wanted him for bedding and probably didn\u2019t give a damn about his title.</p><p>She was her father\u2019s daughter, after all.</p><p>Before he could speak, Mia shoved at his chest and he let her go. Color was burning in her cheeks; she didn\u2019t meet his eyes, staring somewhere to the left of one shoulder. \u201cI shall\u2014I shall leave you now,\u201d she said, her voice huskier than it had been. \u201cPlease let me know your response to my requirements.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vander was so dumbfounded that he didn\u2019t stop her.</p><p>He stood there, staring at the closed door, the flap of his breeches hanging open, cock throbbing.</p><p>What the hell was he going to do now?</p><p>Chapter Four</p> <p>NOTES ON PLOT</p><p>First chapter opens with Flora walking to . . . work as a lace-maker. (Add humble background, orphan, etc.)</p><p>A respectable, elderly gentleman, Mr. Mortimer, glimpses her crossing the street in her clean and patched gown. A girl this lovely, gentle, and deserving cannot be left Impoverished, at the mercy of the Cruel World. (I like this!)</p><p>He dies the very night after he changes his will to leave her one hundred thousand pounds (too much?), with a single proviso: that she not spend even a ha\u2019penny on someone other than herself. If, e.g., she buys her aged nanny a cottage\u2014or a lettuce leaf\u2014she loses the entire estate.</p><p>Interesting. Large dowry on marriage.</p> <p>So why would Frederic jilt her?</p><p>Who gets the money afterward?</p><p>Angry relatives!</p><p>Vander stared at the fire, a half-empty bottle of brandy on the side table next to him. It was one of the few times in his life that he cursed his ability to hold liquor.</p><p>He wanted to be drunk.</p><p>After Mia had left, he had had a grim conversation with his solicitor, who made it clear that he had no choice. Whatever it was Mia was demanding in that bloody letter\u2014which he hadn\u2019t yet opened\u2014he would have to comply.</p> <p>Or lose his dukedom.</p><p>When Thorn walked into the room, Vander didn\u2019t even look up, though he could feel his closest friend\u2019s eyes on him. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d Thorn reached over and took the bottle of brandy from the table, dropping into a chair. \u201cDid you lose a race?\u201d</p><p>Vander was silent for a moment. \u201cDo you remember when I told you that I planned to marry for love? One of my more idiotic ideas, I might add.\u201d What the hell had he been thinking? It wasn\u2019t for men, all this passion.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself idiotic,\u201d Thorn said, holding up the bottle. \u201cYou\u2019re drinking brandy that was laid down in \u201978. This calls for a glass.\u201d He got up and returned a moment later with a glass cut with the Duke of Pindar\u2019s coat of arms.</p><p>\u201cYour marriage is not the topic at hand,\u201d Vander said, taking a healthy swig of the brandy. \u201cMine is. You\u2019re here in time to congratulate me.\u201d</p><p>Thorn put down his glass without drinking from it. \u201cWhat the hell? What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was mad,\u201d Vander said, observing how the golden liquid made little streams on the side of the glass as he tilted it. \u201cBut it turns out he was also treasonous. Not just ordinary treason, either: My father offered\u2014in writing\u2014to kill the king, thereby enabling Bonnie Prince Charlie to sit on the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Vander was still following his own train of thought. \u201cHe was a lunatic. And a cuckold. But I\u2019ll be damned if I let him be blasted as a traitor as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with marriage?\u201d Thorn asked, looking confused.</p><p>\u201cThe treasonous letter is in the hands of a woman. And she is demanding marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can they take away your dukedom? You didn\u2019t commit treason.\u201d</p><p>Vander shrugged. \u201cMy solicitor is confident that the dukedom would be confiscated. Apparently, dukedoms to hand out to favorites are in short supply, and I\u2019ve never been a toady to the Crown.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the type who had bothered to ingratiate himself with George and his court. Or with society in general, for that matter.</p><p>Witness the fact that his only friend was a bastard, albeit a duke\u2019s bastard.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Thorn muttered again. \u201cWho is the woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have? What\u2019s her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poet.\u201d</p><p>Thorn frowned. \u201cPoet? I don\u2019t remember any . . . not Carrington\u2019s daughter!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d Vander poured more brandy into his glass.</p><p>\u201cThe daughter of your mother\u2019s lover is forcing you into marriage?\u201d Thorn sounded genuinely shocked, which was amusing. After growing up on the streets, he was rarely surprised by evidence of criminality.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an accurate title for her,\u201d Vander agreed. \u201cYou could also call her the Lyricist. Or Imminent Duchess of Pindar. If I wasn\u2019t furious, I\u2019d be impressed at her ingenuity. Not to mention tenacity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me make sure I have it right: you are being blackmailed with the threat of a charge of treason and loss of your dukedom into marrying the daughter of your mother\u2019s paramour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like Greek drama when you put it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell with that,\u201d Thorn said flatly, his voice ringing with distaste. \u201cShe wrote that excruciatingly bad poem about you. Her father was a debauched philanderer. Your marriage will be a subject of gossip for your entire life. It\u2019s not worth it. Let the dukedom go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s madness tarnished the name\u2014but it\u2019s still my name. One of my ancestors lost his head defending King Charles against the Puritans. Another fought a battle for King Henry II. A castle\u2014my family\u2019s castle\u2014stood here three hundred years before this house was built. I would just let them go, the history of my family go, because a woman wants me so badly that she\u2019d resort to blackmail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me put it this way: Your mother married a madman, and you\u2019re about to marry a madwoman.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s voice was troubled, and Vander paused for a moment. But he knew madness. He had been around it his entire life. He had only to come within earshot of a person with a touch of mania and his scalp began to prickle.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel that from Mia. \u201cShe\u2019s not mad,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I know how to describe her, but she\u2019s not mad. Obsessed, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll put the best solicitors in the country on the case,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cThey\u2019ll discredit her. Mad or not, we\u2019ll have her put in Bedlam. Or\u2014we\u2019ll steal the letter! Give me her direction and I\u2019ll put a lad on it immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need for that,\u201d Vander said, smiling faintly. \u201cShe gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurn it,\u201d Thorn snapped.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d Vander said. \u201cCode of a gentleman and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s utter rot. In any case, I\u2019m no gentleman. Hand it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a stroke of brilliance to hand you the letter,\u201d Thorn acknowledged. \u201cShe must have known you\u2019d find yourself constrained by your own standards. I would have had her house tossed or just burned down the whole place and have done with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a question of name and lineage,\u201d Vander explained. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than I am. The whole mess has made me think about what I really want. My mother was desperately in love with Carrington, willing to risk everything to be with him. Even though the man was an empty-headed, light-fingered fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo argument there.\u201d</p><p>Vander looked over at Thorn, knowing his face was rueful. \u201cI used to talk vaguely about falling in love\u2014because it was an excellent excuse for avoiding society events where I might find a bride. Frankly, I would be horrified if I was trapped by that sort of passion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI used to think that as well,\u201d Thorn observed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, I would loathe it if my name became a byword because my wife took lovers.

Given the persistence of her adoration, Miss Carrington likely won\u2019t ever think of another man.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s smile was probably a bit feral. \u201cThere you have it. Perfect marriage for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to get an heir on her\u2014which means you\u2019ll have to bed her. I couldn\u2019t perform, not with a woman who was blackmailing me. Unless she only wants your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you remember that poem? If I\u2019m not mistaken, my title is coming in a distant second to my moonbeam.\u201d</p><p>Thorn swore again. \u201cThat\u2019s intolerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. I\u2019ve often thought it would be hell to have a frigid wife. I seem to have the opposite. But I do mean to set some restrictions in that regard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m allotting her four nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPer month or per week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither,\u201d Vander said, enjoying himself. \u201cFour days per year.\u201d</p><p>He looked up to find Thorn\u2019s face alive with laughter.</p><p>\u201cI might give her an extra night now and then,\u201d he added. \u201cOn her birthday.\u201d</p><p>Thorn rarely laughed; it just wasn\u2019t in his nature. But he guffawed now.</p> <p>\u201cFour nights should be enough to produce an heir,\u201d Vander noted. It wasn\u2019t the end of the world to have an adoring wife.

A stallion that he\u2019d bought from Africa, chosen due to his bloodlines, had been delivered that morning. The young horse, Jafeer, had turned out to be both ferocious and completely unnerved by his new residence, and Vander had spent most of the afternoon trying to settle him.</p><p>His stable master was convinced that a good night\u2019s sleep would make all the difference to Jafeer\u2019s temperament. Vander wasn\u2019t quite as certain. There was a wild tone to the Arabian\u2019s whinny that suggested true distress.</p><p>Marvelous. He\u2019d had the stallion shipped all the way to England . . . and now it was showing every sign of being difficult, if not impossible, to train.</p><p>He walked into his study and caught sight of an untouched letter: Mia\u2019s supposed requirements for marriage. Rage ran up his spine like a flame. The woman actually thought that she could dictate the terms of their marriage?</p><p>She was blackmailing him into making her a duchess, and on top of that, insisting on her own terms as well? The hell with that. A man is the master of his wife. Once Mia and he married, he would be in control.</p><p>She might be able to buy his title, but nothing else. With a sudden jerky movement, he crumpled the sheet and hurled it into the fire. It fell against the logs and within seconds was consumed by flames.</p><p>He had never deluded himself about his intimidating size and rough demeanor. He knew he was the least sophisticated duke in the land. But Mia hadn\u2019t shown any fear in response to his explosion of anger, though grown men had trembled in his presence.</p><p>Her infatuation was that powerful.</p><p>She must have made up her mind as a girl, biding her time until precisely a year after the death of his mother. He balled his fist and tapped it against the mantelpiece, thinking. There was something deeply unsettling about the idea that she wanted him so much, even after all this time, that she was willing to blackmail him.</p><p>By all rights, he should feel revolted at the idea of bedding her. But fool that he was, despite his outrage, he still liked her voluptuous figure.</p><p>He dropped his hand and turned away, walking back to his desk. She would probably attempt to use his desire to tame him. Every fiber of his being rejected that notion.</p><p>It might be time to let the dukedom go.</p><p>But . . . he was the duke. It was everything he was, and everything he had. The bones of the house were his. The portraits of his ancestors which lined the walls, the crypt full of those ancestors\u2019 bones . . . the coffin where his mother was interred, his father\u2019s beside her, an ironic pairing, under the circumstances.</p><p>No.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t let all that history fall into a stranger\u2019s hands over something as trivial as marriage. He wanted to keep the title for his own children, even if those children came from Mia Carrington\u2019s womb.</p><p>Something barbaric stirred in him. Her curves, plump mouth, golden hair: it would all be his. He hardened even more at the thought.</p><p>Revulsion followed that wave of lust. She was incredibly short-sighted. What if he locked her in the garret? Starved her? Killed her? He had the feeling that a jury of his noble peers would refuse to convict him of murder, if it came to trial and the sordid facts of their marriage emerged.</p><p>Not that he would actually harm her; thoughts were one thing, actions entirely another. But she could damn well accept his terms for this marriage, and the hell with whatever demands she\u2019d made on that sheet he\u2019d consigned to the fire.</p><p>He dropped into his chair, took up a sheet of engraved stationery, scrawled a letter, and signed it with his full name.</p><p>Miss Carrington:</p><p>You will find below the parameters of this marriage.

Brandy, Bucknell &amp; Bendal, Publishers</p><p>September 6, 1800</p><p>Dear Mr. Bucknell,</p> <p>I assure you that I am writing as quickly as I possibly can, given the fact that I am scarcely out of my blacks. And I was jilted</p><p>I have been making excellent progress on An Angel\u2019s Form and a Devil\u2019s Heart and indeed, I have nearly fifty one hundred pages written.</p><p>I have made some salutary adjustments to the plot, and I believe this will be a most original and fresh novel. My heroine, Flora, is jilted at the altar by the hero, much to her consternation. However, this indignity will not go unrevenged. unavenged.</p><p>She also nearly dies of hunger, and barely escapes the evil Lord Plum with her virtue intact, until she is finally reunited with Count Frederic, who saves her from a runaway horse.</p><p>I believe my readers will find the plot quite enjoyable.</p><p>With all respect,</p> <p>Miss Carrington</p><p>P.S. Please send me all of Miss Julia Quiplet\u2019s novels by return post. I very much enjoyed reading the book you sent. For many reasons, it has been a vexing few days, but I was much comforted by the novel. In fact, I was unable to sleep last night until I turned the last page of The Lost Duke of Windhower.</p><p>Carrington House,</p><p>Estate of Master Charles Wallace Carrington</p><p>Residence of Miss Emilia Carrington</p><p>(And, for that matter, Miss Lucibella Delicosa)</p><p>Mia had been at her desk since five that morning, agonizing over her impossibly late manuscript, which translated to trying\u2014with little to show for it\u2014to write the first chapter. If she and Charlie had to escape to Bavaria, they would need her writing income.</p><p>She had only reached the stage of writing notes about the plot and trying out scraps of dialogue, which she was capable of doing for weeks before actually sitting down to write a novel.</p> <p>Perhaps Flora could knock down the devilish scoundrel, Count Frederic, with her mother\u2019s prayer book (a nice touch), after which he would bleat pitifully, \u201cBut I love you . . .\u201d</p><p>Flora would snap back, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re crying, Count. I lost closer friends than you when I was deloused!\u201d</p><p>Mia had read that insult somewhere.</p><p>Alas, there was no point in even considering a heroine who had been inflicted with lice. A Lucibella heroine would never find herself infested by vermin. Her heroines were always being chased into ravines or threatened with ravishment. But they knew nothing of lice, menstruation, or even rotten teeth. Boils. Smallpox. Syphilis.</p><p>A Lucibella heroine would faint or possibly even die if she was diagnosed with a disfiguring infection.</p><p>What\u2019s more, every gentleman who met a Lucibella heroine instinctively genuflected. It hardly needed to be said that no man would ever whip open his breeches and display his private parts.</p><p>That just brought Mia around to thinking about Vander again, though to be honest, she hadn\u2019t stopped thinking of him.</p><p>She had a fair understanding of the mechanics of the marital act. But that\u2014that part of a man was much larger and more vital than she had imagined.</p><p>Because she had imagined it. Roughly the size of a quill, she had thought. Or a pencil.</p><p>She had been badly mistaken, clearly.</p><p>Unless it was just Vander who was outsized.</p><p>After all, everything about him seemed bigger than other men. His chest was wider, his shoulders were wider. It stood to reason that the other parts of him were congruous.</p><p>He probably had a huge big toe. Enormous kneecaps.</p><p>Humiliation was warring with . . . with mortification. She swallowed hard. It was one thing to deduce that most men\u2019s dismissive attitudes meant that they found her unattractive. But it was another to have heard it all confirmed. Vander found her fat and short and embarrassing. And tarred her with her father\u2019s brush, obviously.</p><p>Mia had been horrified when she first realized Lord Carrington\u2019s adulterous activities . . . but at the heart she was a romantic. Her father had loved the duchess so much that he never re-married. Whenever the duke was released from the asylum and returned to Rutherford Park, her father would worry himself ill.</p><p>He would walk around and around his library, muttering to himself. In a week or two, something would happen at the duchy\u2014Mia was never quite certain what\u2014and a note would arrive, summoning Lord Carrington.</p><p>The duke would be locked up again; her father would resume his place at the duchess\u2019 side. Mia had learned from her father that love was more important than wedding vows. Love was everything.</p><p>Not that any of her characters were adulterous, because Mia had a clear understanding of her readers\u2019 requirements. At the mere mention of adultery, Flora would have fainted. \u201cOrgy\u201d would have made her squeak and run from the room, though Mia couldn\u2019t stop finding new and interesting uses for it\u2014an orgy of crows, for example, or an orgy of sweets.</p><p>An orgy of Vander.</p><p>The memory of Vander caressing himself made her heart quicken again. Lucibella heroes weren\u2019t lustful. They were principled and sincere in their declarations of love, without a grain of lust. What\u2019s more, they maintained calm even in the face of Mortal Peril.</p><p>Vander was not calm. He burned with passion and fury. When he lost his temper, it was as if a lion were raging around the room.</p><p>Perhaps the reason she was having trouble with this novel was that her hero felt so ineffectual and insipid by comparison to Vander.</p><p>Mia gave herself a mental shake. It was time to stop shilly-shallying and determine the broad outlines of the plot. After writing six novels, she knew that once she had the plot, she could write the book fairly quickly.</p><p>She picked up her quill again: Frederic plans to humiliate Flora at the altar, but Flora detects his nefarious plan. Finally understanding where his true emotions lie (but too late), he abases himself at Flora\u2019s feet.</p><p>The count waited on his knees, his elegant head bent, his eyes searching the dust for the answer he sought.</p><p>But unfortunately for the arrogant, supercilious nobleman, Flora saw through the Trappings of Title, and mere Circumstances of Birth. The count was not a good man.</p><p>Mr. Wolfington was a far, far better man, though he wasn\u2019t a peer.</p><p>Life in a hovel with him would be preferable to life in a palazzo with the despicable count.</p><p>Mia paused. Her readers would be surprised by this sentiment, since Lucibella\u2019s previous novels had concluded with heroines in command of many servants, not to mention diamond necklaces. In fact, she had a strong feeling that many of her readers would not share Flora\u2019s ideas about the pleasures of life in a hovel.</p><p>She shrugged. The hero could dig up the floor of his hut and find a bag of gold.</p><p>The door opened. \u201cYes?\u201d Her eyes fell to the silver salver in her butler\u2019s hand. On it lay a letter: rich creamy paper folded and sealed with red wax as if it had been sent by the Emperor Charlemagne.</p><p>Her estimation of Vander\u2019s character was diminishing by the hour. Not that she was in a position to cast stones. But he appeared to have grown into someone with an overweening sense of his own consequence. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Commonsense prodded her. What had she expected?</p><p>He was a duke, for goodness\u2019 sake. People probably fawned over him day and night.</p><p>Thank goodness, Vander had no idea that he was marrying someone with an undignified alter ego, to wit, Lucibella. He\u2019d probably give up his dukedom rather than endure the shame. Not only was he marrying a dumpy charity case, but one who had turned her talent for maudlin poetry into a career fashioning disreputable fiction.</p><p>She took the letter and broke the seals. So he\u2019d allow his dukedom to \u201cgo to hell\u201d if she didn\u2019t agree with his demands? It didn\u2019t matter what his terms were; she had no choice but accept them. What would be, would be.</p> <p>She read the lines below his signature twice and, against all odds, started laughing. She was marrying a madman, so arrogant that he truly believed she was desperately in love with him and would implore him to bed her.</p><p>And he was going to ration her. He would give her four nights.</p><p>Implore him?</p><p>Her smile disappeared. Vander could wait until all of Dante\u2019s hellish circles froze over before she\u2019d beg for a night from him.</p><p>The duke was extraordinarily handsome, no doubt about that, but he was also the most conceited man she\u2019d ever met. By far. She thought back to the moment when he\u2019d unbuttoned his breeches. Was she supposed to be overcome by his magnificence and quiver with fright?</p> <p>Presumably, she wasn\u2019t supposed to be gripped by curiosity. (Which she was, shameful and unladylike though it was.)</p><p>Obviously, Vander had thought that she would size him up and flee in the other direction. Her previous knowledge of the male anatomy had been limited to a few marble statues and whatever she could imagine lay behind a largish fig leaf.</p><p>The size of those leaves did suggest he had a point about his grandeur.</p><p>Still, women must have flattered him dreadfully, if he believed one glimpse would terrify her.</p><p>Whatever else one might conclude about Vander\u2019s letter, it was clear that he had ignored her letter, in which she had explained the short span of their marriage. Fine. She merely had to get him to the altar, and Mr. Plummer could take over thereafter.</p><p>She kept her answer brief.</p> <p>I agree to your terms for our marriage; to wit, that you and I will be intimate only in the event that I beg you for that privilege, and on no account more than four nights in a year.</p><p>The very idea of intimacy made her fingers shake, leaving a blot after her signature. Vander . . . naked. In bed.</p><p>She would leave Rutherford Park directly after the wedding, making the question irrelevant. The marriage could not be consummated, as that would threaten its annulment, though not, according to Mr. Plummer, Vander\u2019s guardianship of Charlie.</p><p>This marriage wasn\u2019t about pleasure.</p><p>Not four nights . . . not any nights.</p><p>She sealed the letter and sent it back with Vander\u2019s waiting groom. Then she wrote two more sentences and crossed them out, until she decided that what she ought to do was sit down and reread Miss Julia Quiplet\u2019s novel. That would convince her that there were decent gentlemen in the world.</p><p>But first she should see how Charlie was doing. She got up and headed for the nursery. Charlie was far more important than all trivialities such as dukes. Marriage. Wedding nights.</p><p>Her nephew was sitting at the small desk in the corner of the nursery. His eyes brightened the moment she entered. \u201cAunt Mia! Would you like to read my essay on Aristophanes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d she said, smiling at him. In the year since her brother had died, Sir Richard had dismissed Charlie\u2019s tutor, after which she convinced the vicar to take over her nephew\u2019s education.</p><p>Her brother John would have been appalled. He had been disappointed by his only son\u2019s condition, but he never shirked on his son\u2019s instruction, understanding that Charles Wallace would manage the Carrington estate someday.</p><p>Charlie swung across the room on his pipestem legs, stopping next to the sofa and leaning on his crutch. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>She reached out, pulled him onto her lap, and hugged him. Soon he would be nine years old. Then ten, then twenty . . .</p><p>If she had to marry the devil himself to keep this child happy and secure, she would do it. John\u2019s will required that she be married; luckily it did not specify how long.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s the matter!\u201d she said, trying to sound cheerful. \u201cI\u2019m fine. In fact, I want you to be the first to know that I just accepted a proposal of marriage from a duke.\u201d She pushed from her mind the fact that she was the one doing the proposing. Charlie didn\u2019t need to know that. He had far too much worry in his young life as it was. \u201cJust think, darling, I shall be a duchess. That\u2019s much better than marrying Mr. Reeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Charlie scowled. \u201cMr. Reeve will come back; I know he\u2019ll come back! He promised to make me another crutch. He wouldn\u2019t leave without doing that. He promised.\u201d</p><p>Mia sighed. Charlie refused to accept that she had been left at the altar. \u201cMr. Reeve left a note saying he meant to travel to India, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her former fianc\u00e9, Edward, hadn\u2019t bothered to save her the humiliation of waiting for him in church, for which she would never forgive him. Why couldn\u2019t he have made up his mind to flee the night before the wedding?</p><p>That would have been humiliating, but bearable. She would have grieved in private. As it was, the letter was delivered to Sir Richard, who had read it aloud as she was waiting in the vestibule of St. Ninian\u2019s.</p><p>Edward hadn\u2019t even informed his parents of his decision to flee the country; the Earl of Gryffyn and his wife had been in the sanctuary awaiting the ceremony. When she\u2019d seen them later that morning, they\u2019d looked as shocked and distraught as she felt.</p><p>In a small, secret part of her heart, she wanted to believe Charlie was right. Someday Edward would return. He had loved her. He had looked at her . . . well, he had looked at her the way she used to look at Vander.</p><p>One day Edward would wake from the terror of marriage that had sent him running from the altar, but it would be too late.</p><p>\u201cI cannot wait, Charlie,\u201d she said, swallowing hard. \u201cOnly two weeks remain before the guardianship clause in your father\u2019s will takes effect.\u201d Her brother had named her Charlie\u2019s guardian\u2014but specified that she had to be married to a man of substance and worth within a twelvemonth of his death.</p><p>It would not have occurred to her brother that she, Mia, could undertake the repetitive and boring work of estate management. He and her father had always dismissed her airily, calling her books \u201cscribbles.\u201d</p><p>Her scribbles earned more than the Carrington estate did last year, but she hadn\u2019t shared that fact with her father, not since her first book came out and he magnanimously granted her the right to keep her pennies to herself.</p><p>In his words.</p><p>\u201cI wish he hadn\u2019t left,\u201d Charlie said, voicing the obvious. \u201cMr. Reeve promised to buy a sleigh next winter and pull me over the snow, and he was going to teach me how to invent things.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s arm tightened around him. When her brother died, Sir Richard had promptly tried to retain guardianship of his nephew, on the grounds that Mia\u2019s betrothed was illegitimate and consequently not a man of \u201csubstance and worth.\u201d That had come to nothing, mercifully.</p><p>Sir Richard often won his lawsuits\u2014which were legion\u2014but he lost this one. Instead, Edward\u2019s solicitors had promptly launched a counter-suit for slander. Edward may be illegitimate, but he was the son of an earl. What\u2019s more, he was an Oxford professor who had made a fortune perfecting various machines, including a new type of paper-making machine that was used by printers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia had actually met him in the office of her publisher, when Lucibella Delicosa was visiting London. For a moment she thought wistfully about the heady first days of their romance, when her father and brother were still alive, and she had believed she\u2019d finally met a man she admired.</p><p>Then she shook herself. Ironically, Sir Richard had been proven right: Edward was not a man of \u201csubstance and worth,\u201d or he never would have jilted her.</p><p>\u201cYou will learn how to invent things on your own,\u201d she told Charlie. \u201cI have to marry someone other than Mr. Reeve. Luckily for us, the duke has offered to step in.\u201d She pressed a kiss on his forehead. \u201cI will not let you go to Sir Richard, Charlie O\u2019Mine.\u201d</p><p>He leaned his head against her shoulder and she wrapped her other arm around him as well. She could feel his bones, thin and birdlike, against her body. He may be on his way to becoming a man, but for now he was still a child, and a frail one.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being Sir Richard\u2019s ward. He looks at me as if I had three fingers, or two noses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe needn\u2019t worry about your uncle ever again. You\u2019ll be a duke\u2019s ward. What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>Charlie looked heartbreakingly uncertain. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a duke. Do you know him well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do,\u201d Mia said. \u201cI\u2019ve known His Grace since we were children, which is why he is being generous enough to do us this favor, on the basis of our old friendship.\u201d</p><p>If only that were the truth. \u201cAfter this marriage business is over, I thought we might take a trip, the two of us. What do you say about making a tour of Bavaria?\u201d Bavaria had always struck her as a most romantic place with castles that she could use as the setting to future heroines\u2019 adventures.</p> <p>The sooner she left England after the marriage contract was signed, the sooner Vander could file for divorce on grounds of desertion or annulment on the grounds of non-consummation, whichever he pleased. As she\u2019d explained to him in the letter he hadn\u2019t bothered to read.</p><p>It was rather sad to realize that although she would miss her horse, Lancelot, there was no one and nothing else to keep her in England\u2014not if Charlie was with her. Just at the moment, her life seemed oddly thin.</p><p>\u201cYes, please!\u201d His voice rose with excitement. \u201cI should like that above all things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that is what we shall do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might have trouble walking on board ship.\u201d</p><p>Mia shuddered at the very thought of Charlie on a slippery deck. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay in the cabin and find ourselves across the Channel before you know it,\u201d she said, trying to sound gay.</p> <p>And failing.</p><p>His slight arms wound around her neck. \u201cIt will be all right, Auntie,\u201d he said, putting his tousled dark head, so like her brother\u2019s, against her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Charlie\u2019s voice was only a thread of sound. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>NOTES ON PLOT</p><p>~ All London at Flora\u2019s feet.</p><p>~ Flora unsure of Count Frederic: Could it be that the count, so assiduous in his intentions, was in reality naught but a Cruel Betrayer?</p> <p>Frederic: \u201cWho could behold such a picture of Feminine Grace and Sweetness, and not recognize one of Heaven\u2019s Perfect Works?\u201d</p><p>~ should he declare himself immediately, at the first ball?</p><p>\u201cMy heart is madly devoted to you,\u201d the count cried.

She woke, disoriented, at five, thinking that it was almost time to see if Charlie was awake.</p><p>But as she blinked at unfamiliar wallpaper, she remembered that she had kissed her nephew goodnight the day before and traveled to Vander\u2019s estate. It was only a matter of an hour between their houses, but the duke had ordered that she spend the night at Rutherford Park, and she didn\u2019t think it politic to bicker over such a trivial matter.</p><p>Her rebellion was to arrive very late at night, whereupon she was ushered\u2014without a welcome from her husband-to-be\u2014straight to a bedchamber, one she presumed had belonged to the late duchess.</p><p>Mia looked around with a twitch of distaste at the lustrous gold tassels hanging from the bedposts, the Lyonnaise silk hangings along the dressing table, the silver urn engraved with the ducal seal poised on the mantel.</p><p>The urn was surrounded by a clutter of small animals made of china and lacquer and jade, a collection that was beginning to feel desperate to her. Could it be that her father had given his lover china animals because he could not give her children?</p><p>It was a morose thought. The duchess had had a sad smile, like a woman with a secret. Perhaps the secret wasn\u2019t her adultery but something sadder. More intimate.</p><p>Mia shrugged and hopped out of bed. She would be gone by midday. There was no need to antagonize Vander with her presence more than absolutely necessary. He would be overjoyed to hear that she had no intention of remaining under his roof, and that the marriage was in name only.</p><p>Her maid, Susan, popped her head in the door with a smile. \u201cGood morning, miss!\u201d She ushered in footmen carrying cans of steaming water that they took into the adjoining bathing chamber.</p><p>For the life of her, Mia couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the late duchess. Why, for example, would Her Grace have wanted a bathtub surrounded entirely by mirrors?</p><p>She herself always did her best to not look at her own figure or, indeed, any part of herself. It was impossible not to catch sight of distressing expanses of pink flesh when the walls were adorned with silvered glass wherever one looked.</p><p>She refused to soak but washed, climbed out, and wrapped herself in a length of toweling as quickly as she could. Really, she wanted everything about this trip to be got through as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the household think of this marriage?\u201d she asked Susan.</p><p>Her maid\u2019s eyes met hers in the glass and then moved back down to the comb she was drawing through Mia\u2019s long hair. \u201cThey daren\u2019t say aught to my face.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d been together for three years, and Susan knew almost everything about her, even the story of that benighted poem. Susan being Susan, she had hooted with laughter over the \u201cpearly potion,\u201d though she agreed that it was fiendish of Oakenrott to tell the world about her infatuation for Vander.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d be glad to see their master married,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut they seem to think that His Grace is making an enormous mistake. It was all I could do not to give Mr. Nottle a piece of my mind last night.\u201d Her cheeks turned pink and she started combing a bit faster.</p><p>\u201cThe butler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that formal downstairs, my lady, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Mr. Gaunt would fall about laughing if we bowed and scraped to him the way that Mr. Nottle demands. And yet he didn\u2019t stop the servants from chattering about the upstairs in a way that Mr. Gaunt would never allow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that my father was very popular in this establishment,\u201d Mia pointed out. \u201cI made myself notorious with the love poem, and after my father and the duchess died together, the scandal flared up again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHis Grace is lucky to have you!\u201d Susan insisted. \u201cFrom what everyone says, he\u2019s never shown the slightest interest in ladies, only in horses. He doesn\u2019t go to balls or even to London for the season; he just spends all his time in the stables. He\u2019s never even made a pretense of wooing a lady.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cSome folk think he\u2019s not interested in women, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Mia felt her cheeks grow warm. Those people were wrong. Vander was interested in women. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame the household for being dismayed by this hasty marriage, Susan. They would likely wish him to find someone elegant, like his mother. Someone to match all this.\u201d She waved her hand at the furnishings.</p><p>Susan wrinkled her nose. \u201cHer Grace wasn\u2019t from the peerage,\u201d she said, \u201cand you can see it in this room. It says everything about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t say such things,\u201d Mia said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t polite.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is an anxious room,\u201d Susan pronounced. She wasn\u2019t wrong about that; there wasn\u2019t a single place in the bedchamber where a person could restfully gaze without being reminded either of the duchess\u2019 status or her passion for miniatures.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that the servants likely wish that I were a different woman, Susan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you need is a new wardrobe,\u201d her maid said, not for the first time. Susan was a dear, and always claimed that her mistress underestimated her own charms, whereas Mia insisted she was merely being practical. Tall women could wear gowns that swirled elegantly down from their breasts, but she was so short that her legs looked stubby no matter the style.</p><p>She had the vague idea that it would take three or four fittings to achieve a gown that would actually be flattering. She had never had time for that, and the local seamstress definitely wasn\u2019t up to the challenge.</p><p>What\u2019s more, Sir Richard had been in charge of the estate monies for the last year. As he wasn\u2019t allowed to withdraw funds himself until he came into full guardianship, he had contented himself with restricting every expenditure\u2014and had ended her allowance on the pretense that, because she was in mourning, she had no need for new garments.</p> <p>Her Lucibella money was reserved for possible flight with Charlie. Consequently, she would be wearing an ill-fitting muslin gown to her wedding. Vander would probably be in sackcloth and ashes, so it hardly mattered.</p><p>Edward wouldn\u2019t have cared. He was a man of intellect, uninterested in the superficial aspects of a person\u2019s appearance. She was a little surprised to discover that she didn\u2019t feel utterly heartbroken at the idea of marrying a man other than her fianc\u00e9.</p><p>According to the novels she loved (and wrote), she should still be prostrate on the floor, sobbing. It had been only a month since the jilting, after all. She intended to describe Flora as turning white as parchment, with haunted eyes and newly slender limbs resulting from a vanished appetite.</p><p>Mia, on the other hand, was as hungry as ever. In fact, after the first shock of the jilting, she primarily felt irritated rather than grief-stricken, and a temper always made her crave buttered crumpets.</p><p>The larger problem was that Mia was petrified by the idea of descending the stairs for her wedding. How could she face Vander again? She had engaged in such unethical conduct toward him. He must loathe her.</p><p>Of course he loathed her.</p> <p>Finally, she made herself leave the room. There was nothing to be done about it: She had to face the irascible duke and say her vows as quickly as possible, after which she could go home and pretend none of this happened.</p><p>It was horrifying to reach the bottom of the stairs and hear voices coming from the drawing room. Surely Vander wouldn\u2019t have gathered a wedding party?</p><p>Her heroine in Love Conquers All, Petronella\u2014or was it Giuliana?\u2014had had to face the guillotine. Petronella lifted her chin and walked bravely to her doom (though, of course, no doom awaited her, because a duke was overcome by her exquisite beauty and risked his life to save her).</p><p>Mia lifted her chin and tried to walk bravely toward the drawing room. It wasn\u2019t exactly the same as moving toward a guillotine, but her heart was certainly thumping as if she faced death. Vander\u2019s butler, Nottle, didn\u2019t make it easier; he looked condescendingly down his long nose before he opened the drawing room door and announced, \u201cMiss Carrington.\u201d</p><p>To her enormous shock, the Duke of Villiers stood directly before her. The gentleman\u2014a distant acquaintance of her father, as she recalled\u2014was renowned for his sartorial splendor and true to his reputation, he was dressed like a peacock, in a coat of blue-and-green striped silk taffeta over a waistcoat embroidered all over with flowers.</p><p>Mia looked rather wildly for his duchess, but the only other person in the room was Vander, also dressed splendidly, in a coat of dark amethyst silk with embroidery around the cuffs.</p><p>So much for the sackcloth.</p><p>She was underdressed for her own wedding.</p> <p>Vander stepped forward and bowed. \u201cMiss Carrington.\u201d Her stomach clenched. He had that kind of voice, a truly masculine voice. \u201cI apologize for not greeting you last evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d She dipped a curtsy. A deep one because it gave her a moment. She turned and curtsied before the Duke of Villiers. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cI trust you are well?\u201d Vander inquired, his face utterly expressionless.</p><p>She could feel rosy blotches spreading up her neck. \u201cOf course. I am surprised. I did not expect that we would have a wedding party under the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ya saying?\u201d a voice broke in, coming from nowhere. Startled, Mia jumped sideways, straight into Vander.</p><p>His big hands came around her shoulders to steady her and he held her there, against his warm body. \u201cUncle, I had no idea you were in the room. Miss Carrington, may I present my uncle, Sir Cuthbert Brody?\u201d</p><p>Sir Cuthbert had just risen from a high-backed chair positioned before the window. He was a short man, about her height, though a great deal rounder. His nose was red, and his cheeks were red, and what hair he had left had once been combed over his bald head but was now standing up like a flag at the prow of a ship. He wore an extraordinary, if crumpled, coat of sage-green paisley silk and carried a matching green cane with a brass top.</p><p>\u201cI prefer Chuffy,\u201d he said, with just the faintest slur to his words. \u201cGood morning to you, my dear.\u201d He was drunk. No, he was not just drunk: he was utterly bosky, actually swaying slightly.</p><p>Vander groaned. \u201cWhen I saw you last, at two in the morning, you said you were going to bed, Uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, by then it was too late to go to bed. Besides, I would have missed this glorious occasion, this nuptial . . . this marital meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you planning to change your coat?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>\u201cThis coat is good enough to drink in,\u201d his uncle said cheerily. \u201cSo it\u2019s good enough to walk you to the altar. Besides, it ain\u2019t as if this is the kind of wedding that\u2019ll involve wiggle-wagging our way up the aisle of Paul\u2019s, is it?\u201d</p><p>There was something endearing about his brown eyes, muzzy or not. Mia stepped away from Vander\u2019s hands and the first genuine smile of the day came to her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Sir Cuthbert.\u201d She curtsied.</p><p>\u201cYou can call me Chuffy,\u201d he said, listing a bit as he bowed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be my\u2014my\u2014my niece, after all. I must have met you before, haven\u2019t I? I mean, back when your father was diddling around with my sister-in-law?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUncle,\u201d Vander said from behind her, his tone flinty.</p><p>Chuffy squinted at him. \u201cWhat? Are we pretending that we\u2019ve never met the gal before? Though I don\u2019t know as I did meet you, m\u2019dear. Vander\u2019s father was my brother, though his brain was all higgledy-piggledy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows that,\u201d Vander stated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mean that we should just stand about and stare at her as if she were a potboy dressed up in a vicar\u2019s cassock,\u201d Chuffy said. He managed to get himself upright and made a wobbly swipe at his head that made his hair fly into the air again. \u201cHow\u2019s every little thing, Villiers? Didn\u2019t expect to see you here, I must say.\u201d</p> <p>It was interesting to discover that the most discriminating peer in London apparently counted a drunkard among his friends. \u201cI had no idea you were in the room, Chuffy,\u201d Villiers said, with a bow and a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, I ain\u2019t going to lie,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cI took a little nap once I realized that the two of you were standing around nattering about the bride-to-be.\u201d</p><p>Mia bit her lip. It was one thing to imagine she was facing the guillotine and another to have it confirmed that people were muttering \u2018Off with her head.\u2019 So her future husband had been standing around and making fun of her. What had she expected?</p><p>Surprisingly, Chuffy came to her defense. \u201cYou should be ashamed of yerself, Leo,\u201d he told the duke. \u201cYou were not exactly the catch of the season yourself, you know. I never did figure out how you talked that lovely lady into accepting you, what with all those bastards of yours. Nearly a dozen of \u2019em, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s countenance had eased. \u201cOnly half a dozen. And now I have one legitimate son as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAm I supposed to congratulate you on sowing seed in your own field?\u201d Chuffy demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re not one to call the kettle black, or however that goes.\u201d He took a step closer to Mia, like an unsteady knight in tarnished armor. \u201cNow I ain\u2019t going to stand for any more gibble-gabbling around like a bunch of old women.\u201d</p><p>The Duke of Villiers nodded and said, \u201cChuffy, you\u2019ve made me feel ashamed of myself.\u201d He looked at Mia and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you were made uncomfortable, Miss Carrington. I have known His Grace since he was a small boy, and the circumstances of his betrothal are not what I hoped for him.\u201d</p><p>Mia took a breath. \u201cI apologize for those circumstances,\u201d she said, and she meant it.</p><p>The duke waited, as if for Mia to change her mind, simply because a duke\u2014another duke\u2014didn\u2019t approve of blackmail. But she couldn\u2019t. Charlie\u2019s welfare was paramount, and far more important than the Duke of Villiers\u2019s opinion.</p><p>\u201cI understand why this gal wants my nephew,\u201d Chuffy announced. \u201cShe has good taste. The boy speaks any number of languages word for word without so much as a book in the room\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Vander said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the best looking,\u201d Chuffy said, ignoring his nephew entirely. \u201cBut he is a duke, and comes with a title. The problem is that he\u2019s a great quarreler.\u201d</p><p>Mia could see that Vander was growing angry.</p><p>\u201cNot like his father, though. My brother\u2014God rest his soul\u2014couldn\u2019t keep his temper. But that was the fault of his brains and not he. He was a great eater of beef, and I believe it did harm to his wit.\u201d He paused and looked expectantly at Mia.</p><p>She nodded. Was she supposed to play name-that-quotation? She recognized the text, but it wasn\u2019t an appropriate moment to be bandying about Shakespeare.</p><p>\u201cThe lad has an excellent head of hair, though,\u201d Chuffy said.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t Shakespeare; it was simply a statement of fact. Vander had a wonderfully thick head of hair.</p><p>\u201cI think that we might as well sit down,\u201d Vander said, impatience darkening his voice. \u201cMiss Carrington and I are to marry within the hour, but the vicar seems to have gone missing. He left to prepare the chapel. It has seen little use in recent years,\u201d he explained to Mia.</p><p>She was just grateful not to find herself in the local church, St. Ninian\u2019s, reliving the Great Jilting. She felt distinctly nauseated. She could hardly believe that she was blackmailing a man into marriage. She didn\u2019t want to meet the eyes of his uncle, or think seriously about what it meant for Vander.</p> <p>The door opened and Nottle reappeared. \u201cMr. Tobias and Lady Xenobia India Dautry,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Mia\u2019s heart sank. Apparently, Vander had invited his friend Thorn, one of the witnesses to the horrible poetry reading years ago.</p><p>\u201cWhy not invite the whole countryside?\u201d Chuffy demanded. \u201cHere, you, Nottle: this is all hugger-mugger. Where\u2019s the champagne? Your master is getting leg-shackled!\u201d</p><p>The butler\u2019s mouth tightened to a thin line. Vander\u2019s chin jerked, and Nottle withdrew, Chuffy trotting after him with a wave in the direction of Dautry and his wife.</p><p>Mia felt dizzy watching the Duke of Villiers greet his son and daughter-in-law. What on earth was she doing standing in a room with people this distinguished and beautiful?</p><p>Thorn Dautry and Lady Xenobia were remarkably well suited. It hardly needed to be said that they were as decorated as a pair of maypoles, and as tall, too. The kind of people who made her feel like a grubby mushroom.</p><p>\u201cHave you invited any other guests?\u201d Mia asked Vander in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d It was astonishing how clearly his eyes expressed anger, while his words were perfectly civil. \u201cDon\u2019t you wish to celebrate this happy occasion, my dear?\u201d</p><p>Of course he was angry. She knew that, and acknowledged that he had a right to be. She just hadn\u2019t realized what it would be like to stand next to a huge man practically vibrating with rage.</p><p>\u201cI had imagined that we would have a private ceremony,\u201d she said, not entirely in command of her voice.</p><p>\u201cPrivate? Why on earth would we do that?\u201d Vander turned and gave Thorn one of those brusque clasps that men give each other. \u201cThank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have missed it for the world,\u201d Dautry said, his voice clipped.</p><p>At least her heroine in Love Conquers All was saved from the guillotine before she was actually threatened by the blade. Mia had the wild sensation that the blade was flashing down toward her neck.</p><p>Too late she realized that she should have insisted Vander read the letter detailing the short term of their marriage.</p><p>Vander\u2019s hand slipped under her arm. \u201cMiss Carrington, you will remember Mr. Dautry, though you may not have met his wife, Lady Xenobia India. They are close friends of mine.\u201d</p><p>Thorn Dautry was homicidal. With one glance she realized that his wife felt the same way.</p><p>When she had made the desperate decision to blackmail Vander into marrying her, she hadn\u2019t envisioned the clear-eyed contempt she now saw in Lady Xenobia\u2019s eyes. After the briefest possible greeting, the lady turned away as if Mia were no more than an impudent scullery maid.</p><p>Mia had heard that Lady Xenobia could reorganize a household within two days, and now she knew how she did it; the lady probably just glanced at the servants who were pilfering the brandy, and they confessed on the spot.</p><p>Dautry was escorting his wife over to the sofa with the kind of solicitude that suggested she was carrying a child. Vander followed, leading Mia over to sit beside Lady Xenobia, even though anyone could guess that she would prefer to sit anywhere else. In the corner, for example. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At that moment, Chuffy barged back through the door, followed by Nottle, who carried a tray laden with champagne glasses and a bottle. His lordship held two more bottles, one in each fist. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he bawled. \u201cThis party is so gloomy I expect to be measuring my poor nevvy for a grave, not a marriage bed!\u201d</p><p>Vander headed over to his uncle, probably hoping to prop him up before he and the champagne smashed to the ground.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s drowned in drink,\u201d Lady Xenobia observed, not bothering to whisper.</p><p>Chuffy was the only person who\u2019d demonstrated any kindness, so Mia felt she should defend him. She cleared her throat. \u201cSir Cuthbert seems to be making excellent sense to me.\u201d</p> <p>Lady Xenobia turned and looked down at her, as a queen might look at an errant chambermaid. \u201cOnly a fool finds a drunken man sensible,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mia said haltingly.</p><p>Her ladyship raised an eyebrow. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be angry.\u201d</p><p>That was a mistake. She knew it the moment that Lady Xenobia\u2019s smile deepened rather than slipped, which was a most disconcerting skill. \u201cI am watching a dear friend caught in the coils of a shamming woman waving a letter that she likely had made up in a back alley,\u201d the lady said with ferocious, if quiet, eloquence. \u201cWe need not discuss the ethics of blackmail. But who\u2019s to say that Vander\u2019s father actually wrote that letter?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe did indeed write it.\u201d Honesty compelled Mia to add, \u201calthough he was likely already mad. I am sorry for causing you distress.\u201d</p><p>Lady Xenobia paused for a second, reached forward and put her hand over Mia\u2019s. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Vander was on his way back to them, but Lady Xenobia waved him away. Perversely, Mia felt as if he were deserting her.</p><p>\u201cI lose my temper far too easily,\u201d the lady was saying. \u201cBut you see, Vander is a true friend to me. We cherish him deeply. He deserves to choose his own wife, Miss Carrington. A wife who is suitable for him. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI well understand your concern for His Grace,\u201d she said, trying not to think about her unsuitability, \u201cand I respect your good wishes for him. I assure you that there will still be time for the duke to find a lady who is deserving of him. We shan\u2019t be married long, and he\u2019s still quite a young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Before Mia could answer, Chuffy swooped down and sat himself between them. He had a glass of champagne that he handed to Mia, and a bottle that he was drinking from.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d better rescue you,\u201d he whispered loudly, and turning to the group at large, \u201cThere\u2019s no music at this party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s not a party,\u201d Vander said, coming around the settee. Lady Xenobia hopped up and swept her husband away to the other side of the room. Maybe she would be more polite now she knew the temporary nature of the union she and her husband were supposed to witness.</p><p>\u201cWell, my boy, you are in luck: I can provide the music. What is love? \u2019tis not hereafter,\u201d Chuffy caroled, or perhaps warbled was a better word for it. \u201cCome kiss me, sweet and twenty, Youth\u2019s a stuff will not endure.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward Mia, lips puckered.</p><p>Vander\u2019s hand shot out. He pulled her to her feet and back against his chest before she could stop him. \u201cMiss Carrington is not for kissing, Uncle.\u201d</p><p>Chuffy blinked up at them. \u201cAre you older than sweet-and-twenty?\u201d he asked Mia.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, feeling very old-maid-ish.</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, I wasn\u2019t offering to kiss you,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cShall we join the vicar in the chapel?\u201d Mia asked desperately. She longed to have this ghastly morning behind her so she could head back to her own house. Charlie might be anxious. She had never left him overnight; she was always there to greet him in the morning.</p><p>\u201cAre you in a hurry?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>She stepped back, away from him. \u201cYes,\u201d she said baldly. She wanted to get away from these people, all of whom loved Vander\u2014which was nice for him\u2014but reminded her that she had no one who cared for her, other than Charlie. \u201cYour Grace, surely you don\u2019t want to make this occasion more emotional that it already is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO, stay and hear, your true love\u2019s coming,\u201d Chuffy sang. \u201c\u2018Coming\u2019? Did you hear that? People think ol\u2019 Shakespeare was stodgy but we know different, aye?\u201d He staggered to his feet and upended his bottle over Mia\u2019s glass, but nothing came out.</p><p>He swiveled and glared at Vander. \u201cIt\u2019s a poor house that doesn\u2019t have a drop of champagne for a bride on her wedding day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone must have drunk it,\u201d Vander said.</p><p>\u201cComing after wedding, you see,\u201d Chuffy cooed.</p><p>\u201cMiss Carrington, you\u2019re biting your lip again.\u201d Vander bent closer. \u201cIt turns your lips a very appealing color. Some women would do it for that very reason.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cI gather you weren\u2019t trying to entice your soon-to-be spouse,\u201d he said wryly, turning to his guests. \u201cShall we adjourn to the chapel? The bride is eager to be married.\u201d</p><p>Eager to be married? That did it. It topped the humiliation of her poetry, of being jilted, of being disdained by Vander\u2019s friends.</p><p>Welcome, Mia thought grimly, to the Twelfth Circle of Hell.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>NOTES ON BEQUEST</p><p>Count Frederic wealthy beyond wildest dreams\u2014begs Flora to give up Mr. Mortimer\u2019s bequest. \u201cBuy a nosegay for my buttonhole, my darling. No man except myself shall give you aught. Not even from beyond the grave!\u201d</p><p>~ Flora fears to trust him. (avoid \u2018Flora fears\u2019)</p><p>\u201cIf you have no confidence in me, we are not destined to wed,\u201d Frederic exclaimed, his blue eyes bright with betrayal. \u201cHow can I take a woman as my countess who trusts loves me not?\u201d</p><p>Then he jilts her\u2014after making her give up her inheritance. (Perfidious! Devilish! I like it!)</p><p>The vicar was clearly unhappy, likely for any number of reasons. \u201cWho stands for this woman?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Vander was proud to see that Mia didn\u2019t flinch. She regarded the vicar steadily, folded her hands, and said, \u201cMy closest living relative is eight years old.\u201d</p><p>Chuffy tottered forward. \u201cShe has me. I\u2019m it. I mean, I\u2019ll be her kinsman and walk her where she has to go. Up the aisle, is it?\u201d</p><p>The vicar regarded him with distaste. \u201cSir Cuthbert, how come you with this lethargy so early in the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it early?\u201d Chuffy asked, with perfect surprise.</p><p>\u201cI believe we should begin the ceremony,\u201d Vander stated.</p><p>They waited while the vicar fussed about with his missal, and Vander started thinking about the way his father used to rant. His mother would listen, or pretend to, but then she turned to another man whenever she could.</p><p>Thinking about his parents\u2019 wretched union, he looked down at Mia with a genuine smile. Her head was bent, and morning sunlight streaming through the chapel\u2019s east window turned her hair to honey and gold.</p><p>A few days earlier he never would have imagined it, but he was coming to understand that this marriage really was the best of all worlds: She was desperately in love and wouldn\u2019t turn aside from him. He was emotionally untouched and need not be concerned about becoming besotted by a woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if sensing his gaze, Mia looked up at him. True, he had promised her only four nights a year together. But he might not mind giving her more.</p><p>His eyes drifted lower, to the way her breasts swelled against the tired fabric of her gown. She needed better clothing; she had to dress like a duchess, rather than a governess.</p><p>Then India\u2019s gown caught his attention. Her breasts were on display, albeit in a fashionable manner, and he wouldn\u2019t care for Mia\u2019s to be exposed.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d his wife-to-be whispered.</p> <p>Surprised, he dropped the smile. \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m happy to be getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to mock me!\u201d</p><p>Chuffy bustled up. \u201cYou stand over there, Vander.\u201d He gestured toward the altar. \u201cI\u2019ll bring my girl into the chapel from the courtyard, and you pretend that you haven\u2019t seen her this morning. That\u2019s important, you know. Not seeing the bride before getting married.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, he grabbed Mia\u2019s arm and dragged her straight out of the chapel.</p><p>Thorn broke into a crack of laughter. \u201cShall I stand beside you?\u201d he asked Vander.</p> <p>A sudden memory of Thorn\u2019s wedding shot into Vander\u2019s head. They had married in St. Paul\u2019s. The cathedral was filled to the dome with members of polite society, eager to witness a marquess\u2019 daughter marry a bastard, albeit a duke\u2019s bastard.</p><p>He had stood beside Thorn at the front of the church, watching as India walked toward them, her happiness shining from her face. She didn\u2019t take her eyes from Thorn, even for a moment.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said abruptly. He turned to the Duke of Villiers. \u201cIf you would join me as well, I should be honored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a son to me,\u201d the duke said, touching Vander\u2019s arm. \u201cBetween us, Thorn and I will work out this mess. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will stand next to Miss Carrington,\u201d India said grimly.</p><p>Vander nodded. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>Chuffy poked his head into the chapel and shouted, \u201cShall I bring in the bride now?\u201d</p><p>The vicar sniffed and turned to face the back of the church. Vander moved to the side, Thorn\u2019s presence warm at his shoulder.</p><p>Chuffy started down the aisle with his arm through Mia\u2019s. He was stepping high, apparently aiming for a ceremonial effect. Halfway up the aisle he missed his step and lurched sideways, pulling Mia with him.</p><p>India gasped. Luckily Chuffy managed to catch himself on a pew and proceed.</p><p>\u201cBy God and all the saints at the back door of Purgatory, there was a moment when I thought I might shipwreck us both,\u201d he said cheerfully, when they arrived at the chancel railing and he handed Mia over to Vander. \u201cLosing my balance as I grow older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would remind you, Sir Cuthbert, not to take the Lord\u2019s name in vain in his own house!\u201d the vicar snapped.</p><p>Chuffy gave him a magnificent scowl. \u201cDoes thou think that because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?\u201d</p><p>At this pronouncement, Mia gave a charming giggle. Vander was still trying to untangle his uncle\u2019s speech\u2014what had cakes and ale to do with anything?\u2014and India was frowning in confusion. But Chuffy and Mia were smiling at each other, and he was patting her arm.</p> <p>\u201cThat one worked, didn\u2019t it, my dear?\u201d he said. \u201cHit that one on the nail head.\u201d</p><p>Vander raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cSir Cuthbert is quoting from Twelfth Night,\u201d Mia explained. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing it on and off all morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has?\u201d That was from India, apparently as surprised by this information as Vander.</p><p>The vicar cleared his throat. Even he seemed amused, if reluctantly. \u201cI could take that reference in offense, Sir Cuthbert. But you must cease your \u2018disorders,\u2019 so that I can get on to the business of marrying His Grace to Miss Carrington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight!\u201d Chuffy agreed. \u201cTime to tie the knot.\u201d</p><p>The vicar launched into the text. Clearly, he had grasped that the marriage he was solemnizing had little to do with love or, for that matter, sanctity.</p><p>Vander allowed the words to flow over him while he thought about his wife-to-be. Mia knew her Shakespeare. Chuffy liked her. His uncle was an old drunkard, but of everyone in Vander\u2019s family, he\u2019d been most like a parent. Vander had loved him when he was a boy, and he still did.</p><p>When it came time for Vander to say his vows, he felt an unanticipated peacefulness. He\u2019d been coerced into this marriage, and likely he\u2019d never be able to entirely forgive Mia.</p><p>But he was gaining a wife who would always be true to him. That thought raised a primitive feeling in his chest, a possessive streak that he\u2019d probably developed the moment his mother had first brought another man into the house.</p><p>Mia repeated her vows in a clear, calm voice. It was surprising, actually. He would have supposed she\u2019d be in tears, having achieved a goal she\u2019d yearned for since childhood.</p><p>She never met his eyes during the ceremony, just looked at her hands. Even so, he enjoyed sliding a ring that had belonged to his great-grandmother onto her finger.</p><p>The vicar pronounced them man and wife, snapped his prayer book closed and said, \u201cYou may kiss the bride.\u201d</p><p>Vander hadn\u2019t considered this part of the rite. His first thought was that he shouldn\u2019t indulge in casual intimacies of that nature\u2014his new duchess might assume that he would regularly engage in affectionate gestures. Mia looked up. Her gaze seared into him, even though there was no reproach there.</p><p>Before he could move, Chuffy bellowed, \u201cWell, lad, if you ain\u2019t going to do it, I will!\u201d With that he rounded Mia into his arms and gave her a smack on the lips, making her laugh.</p><p>Vander forced himself to relax. For God\u2019s sake, he didn\u2019t give a damn if his uncle kissed his bride.</p><p>Thorn, India, and Villiers gathered around, offering measured good wishes. He watched Mia blink when she was addressed as \u201cYour Grace\u201d for the first time. She looked endearingly uncertain.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Chuffy said, clearly having taken on the role of master of ceremonies. \u201cI instructed Nottle to lay on the champagne and a decent wedding breakfast, so let\u2019s get ourselves out of here. You can accompany your wife from the chapel, I trust?\u201d he said, giving Vander a narrow-eyed glare that appeared surprisingly sober.</p><p>Vander didn\u2019t answer, but simply held out his arm to his wife.</p><p>His wife.</p><p>Mia walked down the aisle next to Vander, in the grip of a tremendous sense of relief. It was done. No one\u2014not even the despicable Sir Richard\u2014could gainsay her marriage to a duke. It tied her to a man who loathed her, and to a lonely life after the marriage was formally dissolved, but Charlie\u2019s safety was assured.</p><p>No more Sir Richard and his litigious, fault-finding ways. She would hire a tutor immediately and pay him double to accompany them to Bavaria. She would arrange to have the cottages in the village re-thatched; they had leaked last winter, but Sir Richard was of the conviction that cottagers should repair their own roofs, even if owners of those roofs had grown old in service to the Carringtons.</p><p>Furthermore, she would dismiss any servant who looked at Charlie as if he had two noses. Thinking of Charlie calmed the feelings cascading through her. She had promised him she would return by late afternoon.</p><p>Life would soon settle down to its usual quiet rhythm. She would get back to writing; perhaps she could finish the novel in a month or so. She would pretend this painful episode never happened. She had practice forgetting humiliations . . . this was just another one, albeit acute. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Throughout the wedding breakfast, the party discussed Twelfth Night, which kept them away from stickier topics.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like the play,\u201d Lady Xenobia confessed. \u201cI thought it absurd that the countess vows to remain in mourning for her entire life merely because her brother just died. But I have no siblings, and perhaps I underestimate the bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSiblings grow on you in insidious ways,\u201d her husband said. \u201cI count myself lucky to be related to every one of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut would you go into mourning and declare yourself unable to marry if one of your siblings passed away?\u201d Lady Xenobia demanded. \u201cThe whole premise of the play is absurd. Shakespeare created an improbability and hung the whole story on it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome away, come away, death,\u201d Chuffy sang.</p><p>\u201cThe play is about the way grief can overwhelm reason,\u201d Mia said. \u201cViola is a little mad with grief. When my\u2014\u201d She stopped short, wondering what on earth she was doing. She never talked about her feelings. It must be the champagne.</p><p>\u201cI gather you lost your brother, which would explain why I was the one who walked you down the aisle,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cOlder or younger? Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve spent much time poring over Debrett\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother John was older than me. He actually died in the same inn fire that killed my father and the late duchess,\u201d Mia told him, managing a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cThat was dashed bad luck,\u201d Chuffy said, patting her hand. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s why you went a bit cracked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, did you crack?\u201d Thorn Dautry asked, his eyes innocent, as if the question wasn\u2019t astonishingly discourteous.</p><p>\u201cOf course she did,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cLook, she\u2019s in this house, ain\u2019t she? Marrying the son of her father\u2019s mistress. If that ain\u2019t mad, I don\u2019t know what is. Like to like, they always say, and madness runs rampant in this family.\u201d</p><p>After that charming observation, Mia glanced around and realized that everyone\u2019s plates were empty. She and Vander needed to have the last conversation of their married life. Given that he couldn\u2019t even bring himself to kiss her after the ceremony, he would surely rejoice at the news his wife planned to desert him before the wedding night. She might as well give him that pleasure now.</p><p>She rose, perhaps with a bit more eagerness than was truly courteous.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers\u2019s eyes were wryly amused as he kissed Mia\u2019s hand goodbye. \u201cThis has been a remarkably literary morning. I confess I find myself far more interested in you, my dear, than I was earlier. My wife will be truly regretful that she was unable to join us.\u201d</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cI assure you that there is nothing interesting about me, Your Grace.\u201d She mentally crossed her fingers; some people might consider a secret identity as a writer to be fairly interesting.</p> <p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Villiers replied, laughter running through his voice. \u201cLiterature is not my forte. And my memory is not what it used to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d she said politely.</p><p>\u201cO time!\u201d Villiers declaimed, \u201cthou must untangle this, not I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you that there is nothing to untangle,\u201d Mia said, quite untruthfully, \u201cthough I applaud your Shakespearean fluency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage has made me more intelligent,\u201d he said, looking almost friendly.</p><p>Mia quickly withdrew her hand. The last thing she wanted was to have these people think of her as a friend. She wasn\u2019t. She had done a loathsome thing to Vander, for her own purposes, and she would be out of their lives very soon.</p><p>After they left, Mia turned to her husband before she could lose all courage. \u201cYour Grace, we have much to discuss,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe possibilities for conversation are endless,\u201d Vander drawled. \u201cLear? Hamlet?\u201d Unsurprisingly, it seemed he hadn\u2019t enjoyed the literary conversation as much as she and Lady Xenobia had.</p> <p>\u201cI am serious,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI can spare you a short time. I want to take off these clothes and get out to the stables. I have a new horse that is having trouble settling in.\u201d</p><p>Mia decided on the spot that she was sorry for whoever ended up married to Vander.</p><p>The poor lady was going to have to steal minutes of conversation, given that horses were clearly more important than wives. Hopefully, the next duchess wouldn\u2019t have trouble settling in, because Vander would be in the stables coddling a horse.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>From the offices of Brandy, Bucknell &amp; Bendal, Publishers</p><p>September 9, 1800</p><p>Dear Miss Carrington,</p><p>I eagerly await your response to mine of August 27, but in the meantime, I am including here a number of readers\u2019 letters. I have taken the liberty of opening them, given that unpleasant business last year with the gentleman who felt at a disadvantage compared to your heroes. I wish to bring to your particular attention the letter from Mrs. Petunia Stubbs.</p><p>With deep respect,</p><p>I remain,</p><p>William Bucknell, Esq.</p><p>Brandy, Bucknell &amp; Bendal, Publishers</p><p>Mia walked to Vander\u2019s study, trying to ignore the way her heart quickened due to her husband walking beside her.</p><p>The worst part of this whole affair\u2014other than the fact she hated herself for forcing Vander to marry her\u2014was Mia\u2019s discovery that, even given all the despair and humiliation and the years that had passed since the poetry debacle, Vander was still able to make her feel . . . something.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t infatuation. Of course not.</p><p>It must be animal lust. She had read about that somewhere. It was a natural constituent of being a healthy animal, which she was.</p><p>Vander was the most healthy animal\u2014or man\u2014she\u2019d ever known. In fact, he appeared to be virtually bursting with life, his legs thick with muscle, his skin darkened by the sun.</p><p>Her father had been handsome in a way that Vander was not. Her husband\u2014what an odd word\u2014looked more like a boxer than a gentleman. He would never coax his hair into a smooth wave, the way her father used to. And his fingernails were not shaped and polished to a sheen. Instead, his fingers were callused from holding reins.</p><p>They had entered the study, and Vander was saying something to her. She looked up at him, confused. In that moment, watching his lips move without comprehending what he was saying, she understood something very important: her husband had the ability to break her.</p><p>Even though she had decided to loathe him after he mocked her poem, he had been her first love.</p><p>The weakness of a foolish girl, Mia reminded herself. The wanton side of herself, if she wanted to call a spade a spade. She was a woman now and knew a muscled stature was far less important than a kindly heart.</p><p>No one could call Vander kind. It took her a moment before she realized that he was waiting impatiently for a response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked when your belongings will arrive. I have an important race on the fifteenth, and I\u2019d like to have you settled. I can send my men over to Carrington House to gather your possessions, if you haven\u2019t already made arrangements. Oh, and I gather they should collect your nephew. My solicitor informed me yesterday afternoon that I now have a ward.\u201d</p><p>The last was uttered in a jaundiced manner that suggested he\u2019d also been informed that Sir Richard Magruder was likely to sue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia swallowed a sigh and sat down. The time had come. \u201cI am fairly certain that you did not read the letter summarizing my expectations for our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bother,\u201d Vander said, dropping down opposite her. \u201cYou should know, Duchess, that a man is the master of his household. If I decided that you should sleep in the attic, the butler would have a bed up there before nightfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no need to go to such extremes; the bed in the attic can wait for your next wife. We only need be married for six months, at which point Mr. Plummer, my solicitor, will arrange for annulment of our union.\u201d The details tumbled through her head in perfect order, rather like one of her own plots. This was the cue for Vander to rejoice.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Plummer is a conservative man by nature, but he is hopeful that he will be able to end this marriage by early next year. I have asked him to pay a call on you tomorrow so he can explain the details.\u201d</p><p>Vander leaned forward, eyes glittering. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You forced me to marry you. You corralled me as deftly as I\u2019ve ever broken a horse.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s like one of the great Norse gods, Mia thought with a literary flourish. Acting as if he might whip out a lightning bolt and cleave her in two. She wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear a clap of thunder in the distance.</p><p>She pulled her attention back to the subject at hand. \u201cWe needn\u2019t turn this into a Cheltenham tragedy. We can simply go our own ways. Divorce is allowed only in cases of infidelity or abandon\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off. \u201cYou are planning to be unfaithful, before we\u2019ve been married one day?\u201d</p> <p>When Vander set his jaw, he looked like a prizefighter about to take on an opponent. His gaze seared her, but Mia didn\u2019t let herself be intimidated by his anger. She knew instinctively that his fists might curl, but he would never be violent.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Vander. I thought we could request an annulment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVander?\u201d</p><p>His voice lashed her. This was awful, just awful. She had momentarily forgotten that while she thought of him by the nickname his friends gave him, he scarcely remembered who she was.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d she gasped. \u201cWould you prefer Your Grace? Of course you\u2019d prefer Your Grace. You are a Your Grace.\u201d She was babbling, but she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cMy mother died years ago and I have no idea how married couples address each other in private. Not that we\u2019re truly married. I just . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>A moment of ominous silence followed before he shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cIt is I who should apologize. You caught me by surprise. No one addresses me by that name other than my intimate friends.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Mia said, forcing a smile. \u201cYou needn\u2019t apologize. And as I said, my solicitor is fairly sure that he can have the marriage dissolved in a mere six months. There\u2019s no need for us to become intimate in any fashion at all.\u201d She drew out a folded sheet of paper from her reticule. \u201cI drew up another explanation once I concluded that you hadn\u2019t read the letter I initially wrote you.\u201d</p><p>He took the sheet from her and skimmed it. \u201cYou want to marry me for six months, after which the marriage will end. And you expect no financial support either during or after the marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d she said, making her tone bright. Now that he understood, he could stop being angry. His eyes would probably fill with joy.</p><p>Instead, his mouth tightened, and slowly, methodically, he ripped her letter into pieces and dropped them on the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Mia gasped.</p><p>\u201cI plan to go through that farce we endured in the chapel only once in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you\u2014what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage. A mechanism by which two people are forced to remain in proximity for a lifetime. The truth is that your proposal made me see that a love match is the last thing in the world I\u2019d want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs we have discussed, you are not who I would have chosen for myself,\u201d he continued, his gaze drifting from her face to her shabby dress. \u201cBut there was always the chance that I would have made my father\u2019s mistake, and married a beautiful woman who would collect lovers the way squirrels gather nuts.\u201d</p><p>Mia could feel her face growing hot. There was part of her, the part that wrote love stories, that wanted to believe that not every man found her unlovely. The shallow, na\u00efve side of her.</p><p>She raised her chin a notch. \u201cBe that as it may, I don\u2019t wish to remain married to you. You may not dream of a loving marriage, but I do hope for that someday. Your Grace.\u201d The last two words were spoken with a touch of asperity.</p><p>He gave a crack of laughter. \u201cYou should have thought of that before you blackmailed me into marriage, Duchess. It seems your scheme has turned against you. I believe that is often the case.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, trying to find words. He was serious. He meant to keep her in the marriage. \u201cPlease,\u201d she said, beginning to feel genuinely fearful. \u201cI can see that you\u2019re angry at me, and I know I deserve it. But mightn\u2019t we be reasonable about this? I will happily offer proof of adultery, leaving both of us free to forget this marriage happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother spent the latter part of her life jaunting around the country with another man, incidentally, your father.\u201d He leaned forward, his words clipped and furious. \u201cI am neither mad nor incapacitated. My wife will live under my roof. She will never commit adultery.\u201d</p><p>Mia took a deep breath. \u201cBut I don\u2019t wish to live with you,\u201d she explained. \u201cI don\u2019t consider us truly married.\u201d</p><p>A grim smile touched his lips. \u201cThe vicar who just married us would not agree.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was beating so quickly that she thought she might faint. \u201cYou don\u2019t even want me around you. This is supposed to be a temporary arrangement!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean that,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cI\u2019m sure that in time you will meet another woman, one whom you will love. Remember? You told me that it was likely to happen, and you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference will our marriage make?\u201d</p><p>The cruelty in his voice lashed her again. She could hardly claim to be insulted that her new husband would take lovers, considering she\u2019d blackmailed him into making his vows.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a mistress now?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes couldn\u2019t have been colder. \u201cThat is none of your business, and it never will be. You made your way into my bed, but not into my confidence.\u201d His lips curled, but only a fiend would call it a smile. \u201cFour nights a year, Duchess. That\u2019s what you got from me, in return for my father\u2019s letter. You agreed to that. What you seem to have overlooked is the fact that those four nights will happen annually\u2014for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Mia could hear her blood pounding in her ears. This had all gone terribly, horribly wrong. \u201cA marriage, a real marriage, between us would never work,\u201d she said, her voice rasping with the shock of it.</p><p>In a flash he was standing in front of her, pulling her upright, his hands gripping her upper arms so tightly they would be bruised. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your bed and you must lie in it four nights a year, with me. I think that\u2019s enough to ensure we end up with an heir, don\u2019t you? My parents didn\u2019t bother with a spare, but in view of your brother\u2019s demise, perhaps we should keep trying after our first child. Heroically, you know. For the good of the name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She told herself not to panic. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off again. \u201cYou are my wife. My only wife, Mia. You may have married me on a six-month lease, but I married you for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a marriage of convenience!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. It\u2019s inconvenient, for both of us.\u201d</p> <p>A wave of horror crashed over her. She couldn\u2019t be married to Vander. Not forever. Not . . . not living in the same house.</p><p>No.</p><p>He must have sensed what she was thinking. \u201cYou will live here, at Rutherford Park. Your nephew will also live with me. And\u201d\u2014he leaned forward and there was a distinct flare in his eyes\u2014\u201cyou will sleep with no one but me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do understand. I understand madness all too well, and I suspect you have more than a touch of it. I\u2019d say that we have even odds on whether our children will be as cracked as a broken egg. Another reason we ought to have spares: the eldest might have to be put away before he reaches majority.\u201d</p> <p>The sob that she had held in check broke and she tried to twist free. \u201cLet me go!\u201d He released her immediately and she dashed sideways, putting a heavy chair between them.</p><p>\u201cYou really thought I wouldn\u2019t mind having a temporary duchess?\u201d Vander asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI imagined that we would live separately for the few months that we would be married,\u201d she said, rubbing her arms where she could still feel the pressure of his fingers. \u201cI planned\u2014plan\u2014 to travel to Bavaria with Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather you didn\u2019t picture yourself fulfilling your wifely duties. Presumably you would lure some unwary Bavarian into giving you evidence of adultery if annulment didn\u2019t work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m sure I could bribe someone. With my own money. I would be writing,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t know it, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you ever write another one of those deplorable poems that could be construed in any way to address me or a body part of mine,\u201d Vander said flatly, \u201cI cannot be responsible for the consequences.\u201d</p> <p>Anger flashed up Mia\u2019s spine and she drew herself as tall as she could be. \u201cMy poem was not deplorable,\u201d she retorted. \u201cIf you think that I would write a line about you again, you are sadly mistaken.\u201d She added, \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t write poetry anymore.\u201d</p><p>With a violent shove, Vander pushed aside the chair that stood between them and took a step toward her.</p><p>\u201cStay there!\u201d she cried. \u201cIf you\u2014if you try to hurt me in any way, I shall shoot you!\u201d</p><p>That caught his attention and he gave a rough bark of laughter. She hated that his face still affected her, even knowing how arrogant he was. It was just that he was very beautiful, with his tousled hair and deep bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cAllow me to tell you something important, Duchess. My wife lives with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She managed to make the word firm but polite.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>You\u2019d think no one had ever refused him in his life.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she echoed, feeling like a parrot. \u201cNo, Your Grace, I will not live with you, dine with you\u2014or sleep with you, even for four nights.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>NOTES ON FREDERIC</p><p>~ Flora wakes knowing her heart is in Frederic\u2019s keeping, he of the angelic eyes and . . . something.</p><p>~ \u201cI will love none other than him he,\u201d she announces to Mr. Mortimer\u2019s solicitor.</p><p>~ His request she give up her bequest appeals to Flora\u2019s sacrificial side. \u201cFilthy dross means aught to me; I would live in a Hovel with my beloved.\u201d</p><p>~ Mortimer\u2019s solicitor notes Frederic has palazzo in Italy. (would that make his name Frederico?) Frederic has palazzo somewhere in Bavaria. Or a castle? Ugh.</p><p>Frederic draws her into his arms, kisses her passionately. Flora feels her head swim (\u2018Flora feels\u2019?), and her slender body sways in his, overcome by the Force of Pure Sentiment. Recalled to herself by a whisper from an Angel on High (her dead mother), her slender delicate hand strikes his cheek. \u201cHow dare you forget yourself, Count! My Circumstances have been difficult but my Soul is that of a lady!\u201d</p><p>Vander was in the grip of shock. No one\u2014not even Thorn\u2014gainsaid him. Not that he issued orders to Thorn.</p><p>But where he did command, he was used to unquestioning obedience.</p><p>He was a duke.</p><p>His wife didn\u2019t seem to appreciate what that meant. Every inch of Mia\u2019s small body was rigid with defiance. A sense of profound surprise rocked Vander to the core. For once, it seemed he truly had made a mistake. That he had both underestimated and misunderstood his opponent.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell did you want a temporary marriage?\u201d he demanded. \u201cIf you are so infatuated with me, why didn\u2019t you bid for more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly believe that I would blackmail you into making me your wife because I was still in love with you\u2014after over ten years in which I hadn\u2019t even seen your face?\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s eyes narrowed and his body stiffened. Put that way, his assumption had indeed been illogical.</p><p>Mia\u2019s voice took on a distinctly derisive edge. \u201cAnd the \u2018four nights\u2019 proviso? I suppose that was meant to corral my adulation. Did you come up with that, or was it your solicitor\u2019s addition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cMy father thought a great deal of himself, but I don\u2019t think even he believed himself quite as irresistible as you apparently do!\u201d</p><p>Vander cursed, more or less under his breath. \u201cIt seems I misunderstood the motive behind your marriage proposal,\u201d he said.</p><p>The mockery in her eyes vanished. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a proposal,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI blackmailed you into marriage, which is an ugly business. I would never have done it if I hadn\u2019t been desperate. No decent woman would have.\u201d One side of her mouth quirked up. \u201cEven so, I must confess myself surprised by the arrogance of your thinking I would commit a felony in order to buy myself four nights in your bed!\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence in the room made the air sizzle.</p><p>Vander drew a hand through his hair and said, \u201cI must be losing my bleeding mind. None of this makes sense. You didn\u2019t marry for ambition, for money, or for love. Why the hell did you blackmail me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have time,\u201d he said grimly.</p><p>\u201cI was jilted,\u201d Mia blurted out. \u201cAt the altar in St. Ninian\u2019s. Well, not quite at the altar, because I was waiting in the vestibule, but everyone else was in the church.\u201d</p><p>That was unexpected. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround a month ago. I had to marry, you see. I\u2019m\u2014well, I\u2019m a mother.\u201d She stopped.</p><p>Vander froze. No wonder Mia\u2019s bosom was lush. She was carrying a child. Hell, India looked like that too\u2014now that she was carrying Thorn\u2019s child.</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cNot that sort of mother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you count me a fool, Duchess?\u201d Vander demanded. \u201cI can see your shape well enough. What will you say to me in four months, when your waistline expands? Even more than it already has,\u201d he added, knowing it was unkind but unable to control his tongue.</p><p>Mia\u2019s mouth trembled, and he felt a stab of guilt. \u201cI am not carrying a child,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYet in every way that matters, I am my nephew\u2019s mother and have been since his birth. Charles Wallace Carrington, my nephew, is the child your solicitor mentioned. My brother\u2019s will specified that I would remain his guardian only if I were married to a man of worth within a year of the will being proved. I was betrothed when John died, so it didn\u2019t appear to pose a problem. We waited until I was out of mourning\u2014but he fled the country rather than marry me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vander frowned at that. \u201cI gather the guardianship reverted to Sir Richard Magruder if you did not marry?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cUnfortunately, Sir Richard made it clear that I would no longer be welcome in the house, and I would have had to leave Charles Wallace\u2014Charlie\u2014behind.\u201d Mia\u2019s voice trembled for the first time. \u201cI could not allow that to happen. Moreover, Sir Richard is recklessly litigious and will lay waste to my nephew\u2019s inheritance. In the last year, he has launched three separate court cases on behalf of the estate.\u201d</p><p>Bloody hell. It all made sense now. Jilted and desperate, Mia used the only tool that came to hand: his father\u2019s treasonous letter. Vander choked back another curse. \u201cSo you came to me with a proposition to marry for six months, which I promptly chucked into the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy solicitor thought if you knew all the details beforehand\u2014the fact that Sir Richard will almost certainly sue you\u2014you would be even more disinclined to make me a duchess, temporary or otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Somewhere in the back of Vander\u2019s mind, in his very blood, a pulse pounded, and he knew what it was. His wife had been betrothed to marry.</p><p>To another man.</p><p>He took a moment to consider the emotion rationally. It wasn\u2019t possessiveness. Hell, a few days ago he\u2019d scarcely known Mia existed. That wasn\u2019t entirely true: he had clear memories of her from years before, but he certainly wouldn\u2019t have turned a hair if he had heard she\u2019d married.</p><p>Not possessiveness. He was feeling lust, that was all. He lusted after his little wife, with her tempting curves and rumpled golden hair.</p><p>It must be something to do with the fact that she had just become his wife. That changed things. He\u2019d seen perfectly sound men go mad when they thought that their wives were unfaithful.</p> <p>Satisfied, Vander relegated that feeling to its proper compartment. Someday he would take Mia, whether it was for four nights or longer.</p><p>He simply had to convince her that he had no intention of enduring the charade that would be necessary to find a second wife, particularly considering divorce would further blacken his reputation and make the process more difficult. Mia was good enough, and he\u2019d be damned if he would allow her to leave him on the grounds of adultery, and saddle his family name with yet another scandal.</p><p>Now he knew her weakness, he was not above exploiting it. \u201cIt seems that I am now Charles Wallace\u2019s guardian,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we have to live together!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cCharles Wallace will live with me.\u201d</p><p>He watched as the reality of it sank in. The battle was won. Over.</p> <p>\u201cIn exchange,\u201d he continued, \u201cI will counter Sir Richard in court when he sues me for theft of the estate and whatever other charges he trumps up. I will raise your nephew as if he were my own son. I will endeavor to make the Carrington estate double in value by the time Charles Wallace is of age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would make a terrible duchess,\u201d she cried. \u201cLook how I dress.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot exactly \u00e0 la mode, but I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSociety will care!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t go into society.\u201d</p><p>Panic was settling into Mia\u2019s bones, making her cold from the inside out. Vander meant it. She was caught in a trap of her own making.</p><p>He rose and moved toward her in a lazy stroll. \u201cAll I need is an heir, and I\u2019ll take that from your body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t!\u201d Mia snapped, unnerved by that grotesquely vulgar statement. \u201cI\u2019m not your wife, not really.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d</p><p>She knew what he had in mind. He was going to kiss her. Once, Edward had kissed her for long minutes, and afterward Mia had felt flushed all over, and had a happily muddled feeling low in her stomach. He had laughed, and put her away, and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be the death of me before I get you to the altar.\u201d</p><p>The memory sent a pang through her.</p><p>Stupid Edward and his stupid promises.</p><p>Sure enough, Vander bent his head and forced his way into her mouth\u2014or perhaps surprise made her part her lips. His kiss was hungry and disrespectful and raw.</p><p>She should struggle. She should hit him. She should stamp on his foot, or bite his lip.</p><p>Any of those things.</p><p>All of them.</p><p>But instead her mouth opened and her head tilted. Her arms went around his neck while his hands tightened on her hips. He brought their bodies together with a jolt.</p><p>Mia felt an ache move through her, slow as honey and twice as sweet.</p><p>Vander\u2019s hands slid down, rounding her bottom. He pulled her closer, and ground his hips against hers. Her breath caught in her throat.</p><p>When he drew back, she blinked up at him and found his face completely unmoved. \u201cMy instincts are always good when it comes to women,\u201d he told her, sounding as triumphant as a farmer who got a bargain on two piglets.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the way you wiggled against my cock.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s mouth fell open and every bit of sultry warmth drained from her. \u201cDid you just say that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Vander held her gaze. \u201cWhy the hell not? The good thing about us is that we don\u2019t have to bother with the stupid rigmarole of polite conversation. We can be honest. There was no surprise in your body when I rubbed against you.\u201d</p><p>Heat crept up Mia\u2019s cheeks again.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering, I\u2019m no virgin.\u201d</p><p>Mia couldn\u2019t even speak.</p><p>Vander, on the other hand, was becoming visibly more cheerful by the second. He leaned in and whispered in her ear, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to remove that ugly gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think my stomach is large and my breasts are cabbages and I\u2019m a charity case!\u201d she retorted. He opened his mouth and she gave him a look that closed it. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me. Don\u2019t start lying now. You just said that we would be truthful with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want you,\u201d Vander repeated, sounding annoyed. Before she could stop him, he pulled her in again and encircled her with his arms and his scent and his strength.</p><p>The problem was that when he was kissing her, her mind dimmed like the sun fading at twilight. She stopped thinking, because he was tasting her . . . or the other way around.</p><p>One of his hands closed on her bottom in an entirely inappropriate manner that made her long to push closer. The other held her head so that his tongue could do as it wished. Her brain shut down and it became nighttime, dim and dark in her head.</p><p>His arm hitched her higher and he was grinding against her again. She whimpered, and it was only that sound coming from her own lips that brought her back to sanity. She pulled away and brought a trembling hand to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best possible marriage,\u201d Vander stated. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t complain that I don\u2019t want you, because the evidence is clear.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound calm anymore; his voice was rough. His silk breeches stretched in the front, just the way they had when he\u2014the first time. The sight made her heart thump at an even faster rate.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be married to you,\u201d she said once again, her voice coming out cracked, like a shard of glass.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no longer your prerogative,\u201d Vander replied. He shifted his position and winced, and before she could stop herself she looked there again. He was adjusting himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was the most erotic thing she\u2019d ever seen.

She had to get away.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe that I want you?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cWhat I believe,\u201d she said, blurting out the truth, \u201cis that you\u2019re one of those men who desires any woman within reach. You think that I will remain faithful to you for the whole of our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Something savage and primitive crossed his eyes. \u201cYou damn well better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will go around London and bed whomever you wish, is that right?

You may take lovers and do whatever you please.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest. \u201cIf I feel so inclined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I spend my entire life with someone who finds me fat and mousy.\u201d She made herself meet his eyes. \u201cMaybe if I were really in love with you, I would count myself grateful. Or if I had any ambition to be a duchess. But do you know, Vander? I don\u2019t feel grateful. I don\u2019t feel fortunate.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened.</p> <p>\u201cI think there might be someone out there who doesn\u2019t think those things about me. My fianc\u00e9, Edward, liked me.\u201d</p><p>A big sob rose up, but she forced it back down.</p><p>\u201cBut now I will never find someone who will love me for myself, because you\u2019re so angry that you want to punish me.\u201d</p><p>He began to speak, but she shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t bother to deny it. You\u2019re happy to be punishing me; I can see it in your face. But I don\u2019t deserve this . . . I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not punishing you,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cBloody hell, I\u2019d think you had ample evidence that I desire you. Are you always this dramatic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said shakily. \u201cOnly when I find myself being punished for the sins of my father.\u201d</p> <p>His face froze.</p><p>Mia didn\u2019t even feel triumphant at the evidence she was right. \u201cYou can see to it that I never have a chance to fall in love,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou can take that from me. But you will never know whether I am unfaithful to you. Never!\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s response was blasphemous.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better enjoy those four nights with your mousy duchess while you still have me,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause one day I will find a man who\u2014who respects me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespects you?\u201d His eyes raked her body. \u201cDoes that mean that you\u2019ll never tell him why I married you and how we married? Because he won\u2019t respect you after he knows that, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>The sob pressed so hard that Mia could no longer suppress it. He was right. \u201cI\u2019m going to my room,\u201d she managed, running for the door, blinded by tears.</p><p>He caught her just as she reached it, spun her around.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said with a little scream. \u201cGet away from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI respect you,\u201d he said in a grim voice. \u201cYou did what you had to for your nephew, and any decent person would respect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away,\u201d she gasped. \u201cLet me go.\u201d Tears were pouring down her face, and it wasn\u2019t decorous weeping. It was the kind of sobbing that tears a woman apart. The kind that comes after she\u2019s reminded that she\u2019s not beautiful, and not loved, and not even respected.</p><p>She shoved him again, and this time he backed away, a helpless look on his face, the same look that her father got every time she had a female problem. For example, when her father had ruined her debut year by sharing her poem.</p><p>Without another word, Mia wrenched open the door and ran up the stairs, ignoring Vander\u2019s butler. Tears were salty in her mouth and she needed a handkerchief . . . ten handkerchiefs.</p><p>A moment later she was on her bed, two pillows over her head, sobbing as hard as she had when her brother and father died. Since she\u2019d learned the terms of that bloody will.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she croaked to her brother, John. \u201cHow could you . . . how could you?\u201d</p><p>Talking to John sometimes made things easier, but not this time. She didn\u2019t want to hate John. She had loved her brother. She loved his memory, even though he was irritating, with his conviction that a man had to head every household.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t there to defend himself.</p><p>And yet: \u201cI do hate you,\u201d she said again, her voice cracking.</p><p>Her husband had been smug about his ability to get his tool stiff, given the fact he thought she was plump enough to be carrying a child.</p><p>When she whispered \u201cI hate you\u201d into her pillow this time, she was aware of two things: the first was that she was no longer addressing her dead brother.</p><p>And the second was that she was lying.</p><p>She hated Vander. But she didn\u2019t hate those greedy kisses, and the way they made her feel sensual and treasured.</p><p>She was a fool.</p><p>An idiot to fall under his spell once again.</p><p>She hated herself.</p><p>That was true.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>NOTES ON BEQUEST SCENE</p><p>Miss Flora Percival listened with disbelief to the solicitor as he informed her that she had just inherited a fortune with disbelief.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d she said, \u201cI am but a poor maiden and . . . (something)\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Percival, you are now one of the richest young ladies in all England,\u201d the solicitor said, wiping his forehead. \u201cBut I must caution you: under the terms of this bequest, you are not allowed to give the money to anyone. You must spend it on yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a most perplexing stipulation,\u201d Flora replied, knitting her fair brow.</p><p>\u201cMy client watched you from afar for many months. He had determined to leave his money to a young woman of Excellent Character, with a Noble Mien and Aristocratic Bearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy grandfather was an earl,\u201d Flora admitted. \u201cThe family disowned my mother when she fell in love with an impoverished violinist.\u201d</p><p>The solicitor nodded. \u201cYour breeding heritage is reflected in your bearing. I have taken the liberty of buying a furnished townhouse in Mayfair. I have also ordered a carriage enameled in gold, to be drawn by four white steeds.\u201d</p><p>(Does gold enamel exist ~ Painted in gold? Gilt?)</p><p>Vander leaned his head against the door of Mia\u2019s bedchamber. She was sobbing as if her heart was broken.</p><p>The hell, she wasn\u2019t still in love with him. Obviously she was. He\u2019d never kissed a woman who exploded in his arms like a swift flame that singed and consumed. It had taken every bit of self-control he had not to push her onto the settee and rip that ugly gown from her.</p><p>Even now, hearing her sob on the other side of the door, blood was pounding through the lower half of his body.</p><p>He could make her feel better.</p><p>No, he was being the self-righteous idiot that she believed him to be. Had he really said that she was mousy? He couldn\u2019t remember saying that. In the depths of fury, he tended to say things he didn\u2019t mean, as when he had glanced down to see her thick gown bunched under her breasts and said she was plump. He\u2019d never cared much what shape a woman had. He just liked their bodies.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>He had to adjust himself again. Their kisses had started a wildfire in his loins. Round breasts, curved hips, warm skin, sweet mouth, wet . . . he hoped she was wet.</p><p>The involuntary groan that came to his lips was like a splash of cold water. What in the hell was he doing? He straightened and returned downstairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the entry, he informed Nottle that he was leaving for Carrington House in order to collect his wife\u2019s nephew, and told him to instruct the housekeeper to have the nursery in order by evening.</p><p>To his surprise, his butler\u2019s face curdled. The change was slight, but distinct. Vander raised a questioning eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThe boy is deformed, as I understand it,\u201d Nottle said, lowering his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some around the village say as how he turns the stomach. One leg is more like a flipper than a leg. Amphibious.\u201d He shuddered visibly.</p><p>Vander considered this new information as he waited for his carriage to draw around. It certainly clarified Mia\u2019s desperation. He was fairly certain that she would fight to protect any child, not merely an unsettlingly incomplete one. But the boy\u2019s deformity likely increased her panic.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it provided something of an excuse for the absent fianc\u00e9. He found it unlikely that a man who had seen through Mia\u2019s ugly clothing and reserved demeanor would jilt her. But now there was the possibility that the blackguard hadn\u2019t been able to face the responsibility of raising a crippled child.</p><p>He swung into the vehicle, feeling a bit disturbed. There had been a boy at school who was missing two fingers; other boys had been cruel to him. Vander and Thorn had never joined in, and in fact they had pummeled a couple of fourth-form boys who were being particularly vicious.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t lie to himself and claim he and Thorn were high-minded about the matter. The boy couldn\u2019t wield a cricket bat properly, and so they left him alone.</p><p>When Vander arrived at Carrington House, Mia\u2019s butler emerged from the house to greet him. \u201cMy name, Your Grace, is Mr. Gaunt.\u201d He paused as if waiting for a response, likely to do with the fact that he was round as a plum pudding.</p><p>Vander nodded and handed over his coat. He didn\u2019t care to bandy words with the man about the incongruity of his name any more than he would comment on his nose, which had obviously been broken in the past. Gaunt didn\u2019t look like a butler in a lord\u2019s household, but that wasn\u2019t his concern.</p> <p>\u201cMay I convey the household\u2019s congratulations on your marriage?\u201d the butler asked.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Vander said. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak to Sir Richard.\u201d</p><p>Sir Richard Magruder turned out to be a slim fellow with a beard trimmed to a stiletto point, a style that hadn\u2019t been fashionable for two centuries. Vander took an instant dislike to everything about him: the shrewd look in his eyes, the way his hair had been coaxed to a curl, the gleaming surface of his boots.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, it is a pleasure to welcome you to Carrington House,\u201d the man said, coming out from behind a large desk with a hospitable air that failed to acknowledge that the desk now belonged to Vander.</p><p>Vander bowed, and watched as Sir Richard dipped and stayed down, making a few extra flourishes with his right hand while bent over that, along with his Elizabethan beard, seemed to indicate that he fancied himself living in the past. A servant to the queen, in short.</p><p>He\u2019d barely straightened before Vander strode to a chair and dropped into it. \u201cAs you know, Miss Carrington is now my duchess.\u201d</p> <p>Sir Richard seated himself neatly and pressed his knees together. \u201cI offer you my heartiest congratulations,\u201d he said, his face positively wreathed with happiness, quite as if he wasn\u2019t on the verge of filing a lawsuit. Vander\u2019s solicitor didn\u2019t seem to know precisely what the lawsuit would assert, but Sir Richard was famous for using the court to conduct personal feuds. He\u2019d already sued Vander over a horse he bought from the Pindar Stables, though the suit had never made it farther than their respective solicitors\u2019 offices.</p><p>After a moment, Sir Richard said, \u201cLook here, Duke, you aren\u2019t still chafing about that lawsuit a few years ago, are you? I was misled by my stable master, who insisted that the horse\u2019s droop ears meant he couldn\u2019t possibly be the product of Matador. He was incorrect, and I fully accepted the evidence submitted by your stables.\u201d</p><p>Vander didn\u2019t bother to answer. Sir Richard had claimed that a horse from the Pindar Stables had come with falsified papers, an allegation that Vander\u2019s solicitors had promptly squashed.</p><p>Now Sir Richard began to go on and on about droop ears and thoroughbreds, doing nothing more than proving himself an ass.</p><p>\u201cYour lawsuit was frivolous,\u201d Vander finally said, cutting him off, \u201cand cost me more than fifty pounds to counter.\u201d</p><p>Sir Richard blathered about the prevalence of unfair practices and a man\u2019s entitlement to breach of warranty.</p><p>Vander cut him off again. \u201cMy solicitor tells me that you are likely considering another lawsuit, resulting from my marriage to Miss Carrington and ensuing guardianship of young Lord Carrington.\u201d</p><p>Sir Richard\u2019s face cracked into a smile. \u201cYour Grace, it is clear to both of us, I\u2019m sure, that your eleventh-hour marriage to Miss Carrington\u2014scarcely a month after she was jilted by another man\u2014was cobbled together to enable you to absorb my ward\u2019s estate, which not coincidentally runs alongside your own.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn fact, that was not part of my reasoning,\u201d Vander said.</p><p>Sir Richard scoffed. \u201cShall we be honest between ourselves, Duke? You married the woman to get your hands on the unentailed estate, and I do not blame you for it. However, you understand that there will have to be compensation. I had the expectation of living in this house and enjoying the lands for at least ten years and quite likely longer, given the frail health of my ward. As it happens, my lands also adjoin the estate, to the east of here.\u201d</p><p>Vander knew he was rough around the edges for a duke. He had a darkness that came straight from his childhood, bred from an instinct that had warned him that his father\u2019s mind was not just chaotic, but dangerous.</p><p>That instinct was urging him to squash Sir Richard like a maggot. He stretched his legs, contemplating the situation, allowing the silence in the room to grow. There was no way in hell that Vander would pay him off.</p><p>The real question was whether he should thrash Sir Richard now or wait to see whether the ass carried through with his implicit threat of a lawsuit.</p><p>Better to wait, he decided, eyeing Sir Richard\u2019s fastidiously groomed face. The man seemed unafraid, which was interesting. Perhaps he knew enough about fighting to offer a proper challenge.</p><p>More likely, his lordship was under the illusion that the spring dagger concealed in his pretty walking stick would protect him.</p><p>\u201cI will pay you nothing,\u201d Vander stated. He added a silent self-congratulation; he had managed to keep his tone even.</p><p>Sir Richard had groomed his eyebrows to a point, hence surprise\u2014feigned or otherwise\u2014made him resemble a pet rat Vander had once had as a child. \u201cAre you quite certain, Your Grace? I will bring a suit of law against you, as I\u2019m sure you are aware, in Berkshire, where I am not unknown.\u201d He paused just long enough to make it clear that the justice of the peace was in his pocket.</p><p>If Vander remembered correctly, the Honorable Mr. Roach had been justice of the peace for some fifteen years. The beast inside Vander growled softly, thinking of the many people who had likely been abusively treated in that period.</p><p>Sir Richard wasn\u2019t just a man with a feeling that the world owed him, paired with a reckless disrespect for the law.</p><p>He was a villain, the sort who would slip a dagger between a man\u2019s ribs and continue on to the opera, completely unperturbed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vander nodded, as if he were actually considering Sir Richard\u2019s threat. He could kill him, of course, but that was messy, unproductive, and might lead to trouble. Even dukes were not encouraged to make themselves judge, jury and, especially, executioner.</p><p>And his conscience occasionally reminded him that he had no right to play those three roles.</p><p>\u201cWe both know it would be best to avoid the courts,\u201d Sir Richard added, his voice oily with confidence. \u201cIt might be different if Mia were a great beauty; you could claim to have been stricken with Cupid\u2019s arrow at first sight.\u201d He chuckled quietly. \u201cBut given her limited charms and your parents\u2019 scandals . . .\u201d</p><p>That did it. Vander was going to kill him. It was just a matter of when. He leaned forward, wielding his body\u2019s leashed power as a weapon. \u201cIf my wife\u2019s name passes your lips again, I will become extremely angry, Sir Richard.\u201d</p> <p>One of those absurdly pointed eyebrows rose again. \u201cI applaud your loyalty. It\u2019s such a rare quality in your family.\u201d</p><p>The man had a death wish.</p><p>And Vander was damned sick of being blackmailed. \u201cI want you out of this house today.\u201d It was good to realize that he was in complete control of his temper. There were a few moments with Mia when he almost started bellowing like a madman, but here he was, confronted by a veritable weasel, and he was in no danger of going off like a half-cocked pistol.</p><p>\u201cI shall bring suit against you today,\u201d Sir Richard hissed. \u201cI shall make your name a byword, not that it isn\u2019t already. After all, isn\u2019t your marriage incestuous? Oh, wait, your mother wasn\u2019t married to your bride\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you remove yourself on your own feet, Sir Richard, or shall some of my men assist?\u201d</p> <p>Sir Richard rose and went to the fireplace, silent for a moment. When he turned about, as trim as a china figure on a music box, he said with an appealing catch in his voice, \u201cI feel that we have got off on the wrong footing, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely wish to be compensated for the losses that you inflict upon me by a marriage calculated to disinherit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, my marriage was not contracted with the Carrington estate in mind,\u201d Vander reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s none of your damn business why or who I marry, any more than it\u2019s the business of the courts.\u201d Vander rose.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my business now.\u201d Sir Richard\u2019s face darkened. He lost the air of an Elizabethan and looked like the rodent he was. \u201cYou are stealing my estate. Did you really think I wouldn\u2019t fight back? That I would simply hand over the keys with a smile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do without the smile.\u201d Vander prowled forward, noting the way that Sir Richard was fingering his cane. If only he would pull out a blade, Vander would be perfectly justified in beating the living daylights out of him.</p><p>But Sir Richard had to strike first; Vander had given up on fisticuffs except as a matter of self-defense.</p><p>\u201cEveryone will know!\u201d Sir Richard was growing shrill. \u201cDo you think that anyone in polite society will acknowledge your homely wife, given the disgraceful relations between your parents?\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s fist tightened and gladness unfurled in his chest. If there was ever a man who deserved a beating, it was Sir Richard.</p><p>The man fell back a step and, sure enough, he pulled out his tinsel-dagger. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d he shrilled. \u201cI\u2019ll sue you for assault and battery. And I\u2019ll tell the world that you attacked me merely because I was brave enough to speak the truth: you married a fat wallflower in order to steal an estate from an orphan.\u201d</p><p>A second later the tinsel-dagger was in Vander\u2019s hand and poised at its owner\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cYou have just said a great many things that displeased me,\u201d Vander remarked.</p> <p>\u201cMy servants know you\u2019re here,\u201d Sir Richard gasped. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to. Unless you neglect to offer a groveling apology, that is. My wife is a lovely, intelligent woman. She has the kind of curves that a man longs to find in his bed. I may not have been the first to wish to marry her, but I am the one who succeeded.\u201d To his total astonishment, he discovered that he meant every word.</p><p>Sir Richard\u2019s eyes narrowed. The wretch was dredging up some sort of nasty and irrelevant retort. Vander thought about perforating him with his own dagger just to shut him up, but daggers were for cowards. He threw it across the room and it pierced the door and stuck there, quivering.</p><p>Sir Richard fell like a sack of flour after a single blow to the jaw, a disappointingly quick finish. Vander prodded him with his boot. The man\u2019s head rolled to one side; he was alive, but insensible. Satisfied, Vander walked to the servants\u2019 bell and rang for assistance.</p><p>Gaunt materialized within moments. He took in the situation with one swift look, and said, \u201cDear me. Sir Richard seems to have fallen and injured his head.\u201d</p><p>Vander shrugged. \u201cSomething like that. Have a footman load him in the carriage. He can recover in his own home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer he be sent to his country estate or to his townhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is his estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt runs just to the east of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Vander said, remembering what Sir Richard had said. \u201cWhat happened to Squire Bevington? His family\u2019s been on that land for generations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that Sir Richard took Squire Bevington\u2019s estate as partial payment for an action he brought for assault and battery against the squire.\u201d Gaunt put his toe in Sir Richard\u2019s ribs none too gently. \u201cHe appears to be devoid of consciousness.\u201d</p><p>Vander boxed regularly in Gentleman Jackson\u2019s salon. When he struck someone squarely on the jaw, the bout was over.</p><p>\u201cAssault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSquire Bevington was under the impression that Sir Richard had interfered with his daughter,\u201d the butler said, his face expressionless. \u201cUnfortunately, it was proved in court that the young lady was an impudent young baggage who had made advances to Sir Richard herself, thereby rendering her father\u2019s attack an unjustified action of battery. The Bevingtons have since emigrated to Canada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d All this had happened under his watch. He damn well should have known about it. Hell, the Dukes of Pindar may be responsible for appointing the justices of the peace in Berkshire, though in view of his father\u2019s condition, Lord only knew how the Honorable Mr. Roach had been appointed. \u201cPack Sir Richard off to Bevington\u2019s house for the time being, Gaunt.\u201d</p><p>The butler summoned a pair of footmen, whose faces revealed a mixture of glee and pure hatred as they hauled Sir Richard from the room.</p><p>\u201cSend his things after him within the hour,\u201d Vander said. \u201cHe is unmarried, is he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge. His valet can pack his clothing. It\u2019s a matter of a trunk or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best lay on more men to patrol the grounds. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sir Richard attempted revenge.\u201d</p><p>Gaunt\u2019s face lit up for all the world like a jolly\u2014albeit murderous\u2014elf. \u201cLet him try, Your Grace. Just let him try.\u201d</p><p>Sir Richard, it seemed, had not made friends among the servants. \u201cThe duchess will want her ward to live with her, so I will reduce this household to a necessary few,\u201d Vander said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find employment for people in my other houses; there\u2019s always room for more. Was there anyone you know of wrongfully dismissed after Sir Richard moved in?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI shall make you a list,\u201d Gaunt said, beaming.</p><p>A list.

But something nagged at him, and he paused to look back at the butler. \u201cGaunt, I take it you were acquainted with my duchess\u2019 former intended?\u201d</p><p>The butler inclined his head. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSend a couple of footmen\u2014or hire a Bow Street Runner\u2014but I\u2019d like you to make absolutely certain that the man still lives. It strikes me as exceptionally convenient that she was jilted. He referred to \u2018my estate.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Gaunt\u2019s eyes widened. Clearly, the idea had never occurred to him.</p><p>Vander was a great deal more cynical; a life spent in and around the stables had taught him that men like Sir Richard Magruder felt that they had a right to effect change wherever they wished, and the devil (and the law) could take the hindmost.</p><p>Quite likely, Mia\u2019s fianc\u00e9 had actually fled the responsibility of a wife and child.

You can send over all personal belongings at leisure.\u201d</p><p>At that, Gaunt took on the air of a stern yet attentive grandfather. \u201cIs Her Grace aware that you are fetching Master Charles Wallace?\u201d</p><p>Vander was not accustomed to being questioned by servants. He gave Gaunt a look. \u201cShow me to the nursery, if you please, or must I find it on my own?\u201d</p><p>The butler didn\u2019t even twitch at this set-down, but began pacing up the stairs, keeping Vander behind him by dint of walking in the middle of each step. \u201cThe young master has faced challenges in his short life,\u201d he said, pausing on a stair as if to catch his breath. \u201cYet he has all of his father\u2019s courage and forbearance. He is a Carrington to the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to hear it,\u201d Vander said. The disquisition was irritating, but he admired the butler\u2019s loyalty. It was good that the amphibious child had supporters.</p><p>When they reached the nursery door, Gaunt gave him yet another inappropriate look, saying without words that he had better be kind or else.</p> <p>It seemed to Vander that everyone he\u2019d met in recent days was challenging the hierarchy that underlay all society. It was unsettling. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce myself, Gaunt,\u201d he said.</p><p>With obvious reluctance, the butler bowed and retreated down the stairs.</p><p>At first, the nursery seemed empty. It was a large chamber, bright and cheerful, though it could use repainting. Its walls were covered with lumpy-looking paintings on foolscap, which he assumed must be the artistic efforts of young Master Charles.</p><p>Vander had never seen anything like it. His nanny hadn\u2019t allowed paints, and if she had, his crude efforts would surely not have been displayed.</p><p>From the corner of his eye he caught a movement. A young boy had put a thick tome aside and was rising from a chair, pushing himself up awkwardly. Vander had no experience with children; his new ward looked around five or six.</p><p>As he watched, Charles Wallace picked up a small crutch, hitched it under his armpit, and stood. The problem seemed to be his right leg, though Vander didn\u2019t see anything particularly deformed about it.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d the boy stated. \u201cMay I inquire who you are?\u201d</p><p>Not five. Older. His voice was clear, composed, and\u2014unexpectedly\u2014authoritative.</p><p>Vander approached, but not so close that he threatened the boy in any way. \u201cI am the Duke of Pindar, your new guardian. And you must be Charlie.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence ensued before the boy said, \u201cIf you will forgive the impertinence, Your Grace, I am Master Charles Wallace to those who know me, and Lord Carrington to those who do not.\u201d</p><p>Vander felt a flare of amusement and it took everything he had to suppress a smile. Instead, he swept into the bow he had been trained to give to royalty. \u201cLord Carrington.\u201d</p><p>On straightening, he was disconcerted to discover that the gray eyes opposite his showed distinct signs of disapproval.</p><p>\u201cIf you are expecting me to bow in return,\u201d the boy said, \u201cI shall disappoint you. As you can see, my right leg does not function as well as it might.\u201d</p><p>Vander had never had much to do with children, though he was extremely fond of Thorn\u2019s young ward, Rose. India had told him once that it was best not to deceive children. They saw through you.</p><p>\u201cMy bow acknowledged your rank,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the event that a gentleman is unable to bow with a bended leg, whether through illness or injury, he bows from the waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might topple,\u201d Charles Wallace countered.</p><p>His eyes were light gray and surrounded by an extraordinary fringe of dark lashes. His hair was curly and thick, and stuck out from his head; his chin was pointed and his cheekbones were sharp. He wasn\u2019t beautiful, by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>Still, the worst thing Vander could do was to coddle him. Mia had probably pampered him, albeit with the best intentions in mind. Kept him around the house splashing paint onto sheets of paper even though any idiot could see the boy had no talent.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cGive it a try.\u201d</p><p>Charles Wallace gave him a narrow-eyed glance, bent at the waist and\u2014as he\u2019d predicted, toppled. He rolled smoothly as he met the floor.</p><p>Vander took a few steps closer. \u201cNice form in the roll,\u201d he observed coolly. \u201cWould you like a hand up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Charles Wallace said. He turned onto his side and pushed himself up.</p><p>\u201cI think your crutch may be a bit short for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you Aunt Mia\u2019s new husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call your aunt by her first name? Just don\u2019t do it in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not go in public,\u201d Charlie stated, with all the hauteur of a young emperor.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but his eyes silently informed Vander that he shouldn\u2019t ask stupid questions.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019ll sit down,\u201d Vander said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join me?\u201d He moved to an ancient sofa and sat, deliberately refraining from looking back to check Charlie\u2019s progress.</p><p>The boy showed up after a moment and seated himself at the other end of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you a tutor or someone of that nature?\u201d</p><p>The boy shrugged his thin shoulders. \u201cSir Richard declared my tutor a toadying idiot, and dismissed him. The curate is drilling me in Latin and Mr. Gaunt is teaching me chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Sir Richard find another tutor?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe says it\u2019s absurd for a cripple to study as if he were capable of going to school.\u201d Thankfully, Charlie sounded unperturbed by his former guardian\u2019s insult.</p><p>\u201cHow are you meant to run your estate, if you remain uneducated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Mia has asked him that. He said that there would be time enough to consider it if I survive to my majority.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to Vander that, had he not entered the scene, there was a distinct possibility that Charlie might have suffered from \u201can unfortunate accident\u201d sometime in the next few years. \u201cYou look quite healthy to me. Have you anything wrong with you other than your leg?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is wrong with it? Oddly shaped, unable to move, too short?\u201d He kept the question direct, but asked it without any special emphasis.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t shaped properly below the knee.\u201d Charlie\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cThe villagers all think my foot is a flipper, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a normal foot turned sideways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to look on the bright side: if your estate is lost one day you can hire yourself out to a traveling fair.\u201d</p><p>With this, he managed to break the defensive calm that surrounded Charlie like a suit of armor. A flush rose in his sallow cheeks. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a nice thing to say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoys don\u2019t say nice things to each other,\u201d Vander told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a boy. You\u2019re a duke. You ought to be more polite!\u201d</p><p>Vander grinned at him. \u201cYou\u2019re my ward now. I don\u2019t feel like being polite. What\u2019s the matter? You don\u2019t like traveling fairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; I\u2019ve never seen one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? The fair comes through the village twice a year.\u201d</p><p>Charlie shrugged and his eyes went flat again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid to be seen in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>That was good. He had backbone and fight in him.</p><p>\u201cSince you won\u2019t let me call you Charlie, perhaps I\u2019ll call you Crip instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor cripple?\u201d Charlie\u2019s jaw set. \u201cNo! You wouldn\u2019t wish to be called Crip, if you were me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was at school,\u201d Vander said, stretching out his legs in front of him and looking at his boots, \u201cI was called Horny. And sometimes Vulcan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVulcan, like the Roman god? Why? And why Horny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were references to the fact that my mother, the duchess, was blatantly adulterous. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was intimate friends with a man who wasn\u2019t her husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the way that Venus took lovers and Vulcan didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cDid your father get angry, the way Vulcan did, when he found out? Vulcan used to make a mountain explode every time Venus took a new lover.\u201d Charlie\u2019s voice was bright and interested now.</p><p>\u201cMy father never learned about my mother\u2019s friendship. Horny is a reference to a cuckold\u2019s horns, a nasty way of identifying a man whose wife\u2019s affections are otherwise engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the boys would make this gesture whenever they saw me, particularly in the first year I was in school.\u201d</p><p>He showed Charlie how to make horns with his thumb and little finger. Like any boy, Charlie started making horns left and right.</p><p>\u201cI could either get on with it, and realize that people were going to call me names because of my mother\u2019s behavior, or I could fight every boy in the school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I would have done,\u201d Charlie said, showing a sudden bloodthirsty side. \u201cIf I were you, I mean, and I had two normal legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried that in my first year,\u201d Vander said meditatively. \u201cI pummeled quite a few of them. Smashed their faces in the dirt and made them swear never to call me Horny again. I didn\u2019t mind Vulcan as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they stop making horns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Some people will call you Limpy or Crip and names like that behind your back your whole life.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Charlie\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cA great many people will be watching me to see whether your aunt falls in love with another man,\u201d Vander continued. \u201cThey will be curious about whether the men in my family have some sort of deficit. They think that the Dukes of Pindar aren\u2019t able to satisfy their wives.\u201d</p><p>Charlie had been tucked into his corner of the sofa, but he leaned forward and patted Vander\u2019s knee with a thin white hand. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about that,\u201d he said comfortingly. \u201cMy aunt will never fall in love again. She told me so. That means that she\u2019ll never leave you the way Venus left her husband.\u201d</p><p>Vander felt a sudden stillness. \u201cSo she was in love with her betrothed? What was his name?\u201d he added casually.</p><p>\u201cMr. Edward Reeve,\u201d Charlie replied. \u201cHe is the son of the Earl of Gryffyn.\u201d</p><p>An icy sensation swept over Vander. It was that possessive instinct, of course. Nothing but that. No man liked to hear about his wife\u2019s affection for another man.</p><p>\u201cIn the end, he couldn\u2019t face the responsibility of raising me. That\u2019s what he said in his note.\u201d Charlie\u2019s eyes slid off to the empty fireplace.</p><p>\u201cHe was a selfish fool,\u201d Vander said, his voice harsh. \u201cHow did you learn what was in his note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Richard read it aloud.\u201d Charlie\u2019s voice trembled a bit. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have done that. Aunt Mia shouted at him afterward.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s response was blasphemous.</p><p>Charlie brightened instantly and asked what two of his words meant.</p><p>So Vander defined them, with the proviso that he not share his expanded vocabulary with his aunt.</p><p>\u201cThe worst of it was that Sir Richard had Mr. Reeve\u2019s note in his pocket, but he waited until the church was full. Then he pretended to remember it had been delivered earlier that morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Richard should be horsewhipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Mia called him a bastard,\u201d Charlie said with relish. \u201cThat\u2019s someone whose parents weren\u2019t married. Mr. Reeve was a bastard, too, because his parents weren\u2019t married and he left my aunt in the church.\u201d</p><p>The image of his wife waiting in the church for some numbskull while Sir Richard played vicious games was enough to make Vander\u2019s gut burn. \u201cI\u2019ll make him pay.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Charlie\u2019s mouth quirked up. \u201cSo violence is the solution now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are times when it is the only thing that satisfies.\u201d</p><p>Charlie\u2019s brows furrowed.</p><p>Vander guessed what he was thinking. \u201cWe\u2019re going to put you on a horse. Build up your muscles. And we\u2019ll find a way for you to defend yourself when you\u2019re on your own feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone can shove me over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you had a dagger or a rapier,\u201d Vander said, giving him a wolfish grin.</p><p>\u201cA rapier?\u201d Charlie\u2019s face lit up. And fell just as quickly. \u201cHow would I hold a rapier? I\u2019m always carrying my crutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could put a concealed dagger in your crutch. They do it with walking sticks all the time. Not that you want to stab anyone, but a man needs a weapon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou should stab Sir Richard with a rapier!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s best to avoid manslaughter except when absolutely necessary,\u201d Vander said, the thought crossing his mind that perhaps he wasn\u2019t the best model for a boy. He was hardly peaceable in his temperament.</p><p>Neither, it seemed, was Charlie. \u201cYou should kill Mr. Reeve as well. Aunt Mia says that sometimes men are not as courageous as one would hope, but I think he was horrid to leave her like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d Vander promised. \u201cYour aunt\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is definitely a scoundrel. He blamed his inadequacies on you, which is a shameful thing to do.\u201d He leaned over and poked Charlie in the stomach. \u201cDon\u2019t you agree with me, Crip?\u201d</p> <p>Color washed Charlie\u2019s thin cheeks again and he lurched to his feet, his crutch thumping the wooden floor. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to be called that name!\u201d</p><p>Reeve\u2019s loss was his gain. Vander genuinely liked this boy. He rose and then crouched down in front of Charlie so their eyes were on a level. \u201cAll right, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Can I call you Gammy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeg-leg?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must address you as Lord Carrington?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, \u201cI suppose you can call me Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that make me Uncle Vander, in private at least?\u201d</p><p>A tiny smile played on Charlie\u2019s mouth, the first Vander had seen. \u201cI think I\u2019ll call you Vulcan in private.\u201d</p> <p>Vander snorted. \u201cYou call me Vulcan and I\u2019ll call you Crip. That way you won\u2019t give a toss by the time you get to school.\u201d</p><p>Charlie blinked. \u201cSchool! I can\u2019t go to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a cripple. You don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s like going to the fair. I might be pushed over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? You\u2019ve shown me that you know how to roll. You can\u2019t stay in this room like a fairy-tale princess asleep behind her briars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a princess,\u201d Charlie said, scowling.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go downstairs and fetch some food from the kitchens, and after that we\u2019ll set out for my house. There\u2019s an art to raiding the larder, Crip, and every young lord needs to know it.\u201d</p><p>They made their way to the top of the stairs, and stood for a moment looking down the rounded sweep.</p> <p>\u201cIs this one of the reasons you spend so much time in the nursery?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>The boy nodded. \u201cIt takes me too long to get down. I have to cling to the rail and I feel as if the footmen are laughing behind my back. Mr. Gaunt used to carry me down, but I\u2019m too big for that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Vander put Charlie\u2019s hand on the magnificent mahogany banister. \u201cDo you feel how smooth this is? It is meant for sliding down. I\u2019ll take your crutch this time, but next time you can tuck it under your arm.\u201d</p><p>Charlie\u2019s eyes grew round. \u201cAunt Mia would kill me.\u201d</p><p>Vander pretended to look around. \u201cAunt? Any aunts here?\u201d He grinned at Charlie. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you at the bottom. Turn around and slide on your stomach.\u201d</p><p>Charlie was clearly apprehensive, but he was a brave fellow. When Vander reached the bottom and shouted, \u201cOn you go, Crip,\u201d he clambered awkwardly onto the banister.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d Vander hollered.</p><p>He did, with just a little squeak.</p><p>Vander watched as the small body slid toward him, black hair flying. He caught Charlie easily before the newel post could inflict damage. \u201cAt my house we\u2019ll post a footman at the foot of the stairs and tell him it\u2019s his job to catch you. When you\u2019ve had more practice, you\u2019ll be able to stop yourself.\u201d</p><p>Charlie\u2019s cheeks were red and his eyes shone. \u201cThat was terrific!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Vander said, grinning at him.</p><p>\u201cAunt Mia will hate it.\u201d Charlie\u2019s smile was reckless and delighted.</p><p>\u201cMothers, and aunts, are generally vexed when their children discover speed. Wait until she sees you galloping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t permit it,\u201d Charlie breathed.</p><p>\u201cA man can\u2019t let himself be governed by a woman, can he?\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s thin chest swelled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Time for bread and cheese. I\u2019m tired of calling you Crip. What do you think of Peg-Legged Pete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Charlie said happily.</p><p>\u201cHop-Along Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>From Miss Carrington to Mssrs. Brandy, Bucknell &amp; Bendal, Publishers</p><p>September 9, 1800</p><p>Dear Mr. Bucknell,</p><p>I expect you have seen this in the Morning Post, but you should learn of it directly from me as well: since our last exchange, I have become married to the Duke of Pindar through a series of misunderstandings that could enliven the pages of one of Lucibella\u2019s novels. It is but a temporary arrangement; we shall soon have all this bother unraveled, but it does make it even more imperative that no one discover my identity as a novelist. There may be those who would find the Pindar legacy tarnished by Lucibella\u2019s literary efforts.</p><p>I assure you I am working diligently on the novel, and not in the least distracted by my new circumstances. I am sending this missive with one of the duke\u2019s grooms, who will be happy to wait for your response. I would be grateful to receive the Quiplet novels as well.</p><p>Miss Carrington. Her Grace, the Duchess of Pindar</p><p>Mia spent the afternoon fuming over her husband\u2019s presumptuous ways. She would rather have introduced Charles Wallace to Vander herself.</p><p>And what was taking this long? It was a mere hour\u2019s coach ride between their houses, and after three hours turned to four, she began to fret. Perhaps Charlie had objected to leaving home with a stranger.</p><p>In an effort to distract herself, she began to write notes toward her novel, working on the little desk in her bedchamber. An hour or so later, she took her writing materials down to the drawing room and, after clearing away a herd of glass rabbits, set herself to writing at a table that faced the courtyard.</p><p>Poor Flora was being excoriated by the unpleasant owner of a lace-making establishment when she finally heard the rumble of carriage wheels coming up the drive.</p><p>Nottle and two footmen were loitering in the entry when she dashed out of the drawing room. \u201cOpen the door, if you please,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI shall fetch your pelisse, Your Grace,\u201d he said, managing to convey just what he thought of a duchess with ink-stained fingers and\u2014she glanced down\u2014ink stains on her cuffs as well.</p><p>\u201cThe door, Nottle,\u201d she said, between clenched teeth.</p><p>A groom in splendid livery was just opening the door of the carriage. Vander descended, then he stuck his head back into the carriage and stepped back. Before she could dash down the steps, Charlie appeared in the carriage door, crutch under his arm, and hopped down.</p><p>Mia didn\u2019t make a sound, though a scream was caught somewhere in her chest. Of course, it wasn\u2019t a great distance from the carriage to the gravel. But she had always been careful to have a footman place a handy step and hold Charlie\u2019s elbow.</p><p>At any rate, Charlie was swinging toward her, his eyes shining. She caught him up when he reached her, swinging him in a circle so that his hair flew into the air. \u201cCharlie, my love!\u201d He tolerated three kisses, but then he struggled away and turned to look up at the ducal mansion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth fell open. \u201cIs this where we\u2019re going to live?\u201d Vander had caught up with them, and Charlie turned. \u201cIs this your house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever show astonishment, Crip,\u201d Vander said. \u201cBut yes, this is Rutherford Manor.\u201d</p><p>Mia frowned. \u201cWhat did you call Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you she wouldn\u2019t like it,\u201d Charlie said to Vander.</p> <p>\u201cCharlie and I are trying out nicknames to decide which one he likes the best,\u201d Vander said. \u201cSo far he\u2019s rejected Hop-Along Harry and Peg-Legged Pete, but I have high hopes that he\u2019ll get used to Crip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not acceptable,\u201d Mia said, low and fierce. She glanced down to see if Charlie was scarred by this calloused treatment, but he had tipped his head back to see Vander\u2019s face and there was an unmistakable look of hero-worship in his eyes.</p><p>Vander shrugged.</p><p>Mia opened her mouth to elaborate, but Nottle was standing in the doorway, and Charlie had three marble steps to climb, as well as the sweeping round of stairs leading upstairs. \u201cLet\u2019s investigate the nursery,\u201d she said instead, making up her mind to discuss the subject with Vander when they were alone.</p><p>Vander squatted down and said, \u201cCharlie, old man, it\u2019s been a long day, and I think you should take a ride upstairs. Give your crutch to your aunt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharlie hates to\u2014\u201d Mia began.</p><p>\u201cOn your back?\u201d Charlie said eagerly, passing her his crutch.</p><p>\u201cYup. The same way we came up from the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>As she watched, dumbfounded, Vander turned about, and Charlie wound his thin arms around Vander\u2019s neck and his legs around his waist.</p><p>Vander\u2019s embroidered coat probably cost more than a cottager made in three seasons. But he showed no signs of worry about damage from Charlie\u2019s boots.</p><p>It took time to settle Charlie into the new nursery, and all the while Mia was awash in contradictory feelings. Part of her was still incredulous about Vander\u2019s demand that they remain married. Another part was fearful. A third was grieving for the husband she had hoped to have someday.</p> <p>And the marriage she\u2019d hoped to have too: a partnership with a rational, honorable man who would love, cherish, and respect her.</p><p>She only had herself to blame. She hadn\u2019t been honorable so, of course, a merciless fate had handed her Vander as a husband. It was like something out of the great myths, the ones in which an awful blunder led to a catastrophic end.</p><p>With a proverb at the finish, something about deceitful women, no doubt, and dishonorable men.</p><p>Not that Vander was dishonorable. So it went: around and around in a vicious, maddening circle, all afternoon and into the evening until Mia was so desperate that she promptly downed a glass of sherry on entering the drawing room.</p><p>Vander was already there, looking none the worse for wear for having engaged in a round of fisticuffs with Sir Richard. Susan had told her the details as Mia dressed for supper, and reported as well that the downstairs was galvanized by a sense of vicarious triumph.</p><p>Mia heartily approved. Frankly, if she had been strong enough to pummel Sir Richard, she would have done so long ago\u2014perhaps the first time that he assured her that Charlie had little chance of living more than a few years.</p><p>There was no sign of Chuffy in the drawing room, which gave Mia a prickling feeling of unease. Nottle had taken himself away to supervise preparations for the evening meal, and she and Vander were alone.</p><p>Vander had changed into a plain black coat. His hair tumbled around his ears in a style that bore no resemblance to the latest fashions but was fifty times more sensual for that. His cravat\u2014well, it was tied. That was about all you could say for it.</p> <p>Still, she was uncomfortably aware that she couldn\u2019t take her eyes from him. It was preposterous: she was a civilized young lady of the brand-new century, and yet an errant part of her soul was thrilled by his rough edges and brutishness. According to Susan\u2019s account, he had knocked out Sir Richard with one blow.</p><p>\u201cMore wine?\u201d Vander asked, eyeing her empty glass.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Mia answered. \u201cI become tipsy very quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChuffy has the monopoly on that particular sin,\u201d Vander said, taking a drink of brandy that smelled far better than the bitter sherry Nottle had handed her. Without asking what she\u2019d prefer, she might add.</p><p>She wandered over to say hello to the glass menagerie on the mantel. \u201cIf you dislike the animals, have you thought of boxing them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will soon perish as clothing flies through the air.\u201d There was something about the way he drawled that which made her pause. What on earth did he mean?</p><p>She turned. \u201cDo you often disrobe in the drawing room?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cOnly when driven to do so.\u201d His eyes had a truly wicked glint. \u201cI have high hopes for marriage.\u201d</p><p>Mia choked. \u201cThat sounds like a man who thinks four nights with him are worth a king\u2019s ransom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that disrobing in a public room is akin to bedding: I shall do so only if my wife implores me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour valet will be happy to know that I have no plans to disturb his labors,\u201d Mia said, taking a deep breath of the mixture of horse and sunshine that hung about her husband. It made her long to fly into his arms and simply breathe him in. Absurd.</p><p>\u201cI am curious to know more about the fianc\u00e9 who preceded me,\u201d Vander said, just as Chuffy wandered into the room.</p><p>\u201cOh, had you a fianc\u00e9?\u201d Chuffy asked genially. He was already equipped with a glass of brandy.</p><p>Mia smiled at him, relieved that he had joined them. \u201cGood evening, Sir Cuthbert. Indeed, I did have a fianc\u00e9 before His Grace was kind enough to come to my aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat about the bush, gal,\u201d Chuffy advised. \u201cVander didn\u2019t come to your aid as much as you forced him to marry you. I like the turn on an old story. Why, if this got out, it would gladden the hearts of maidens everywhere. Like one of my novels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour novels?\u201d Mia\u2019s heart bounded. She had never met another novelist, let alone formed a friendship with one, for obvious reasons.</p><p>\u201cChuffy has a weakness for gothic novels,\u201d Vander said. \u201cHe reads every one he can get his hands on. The more disreputable, the better, isn\u2019t that right, Chuffy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy taste is not entirely respectable,\u201d Chuffy confided. \u201cI imagine you\u2019ve never read anything so paltry. I say, do you mind if I call you Emilia? I find \u2018Your Gracing\u2019 right and left to be taxing. Hard to remember. You\u2019d better start calling me Chuffy now, because I\u2019m getting on in years. In no time I won\u2019t remember my own title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be honored, if you called me Mia. But truly, as I have been trying to persuade the duke, our marriage is one of convenience only, designed to safeguard my nephew\u2019s inheritance. I shan\u2019t be here in five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvenience!\u201d Chuffy\u2019s eyes rounded. \u201cMy favorite plot device! Tell me, my dear, have you read any of Miss Julia Quiplet\u2019s novels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have read one,\u201d Mia said. \u201cI liked it very much, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chuffy interrupted her. \u201cThere\u2019s another novelist who\u2019s just as good. Though I can\u2019t seem to remember her name at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Mia stiffened. It would be disappointing if Chuffy was referring to Mrs. Scudgell\u2019s novels; in Mia\u2019s opinion, those books were hurt by their reliance on implausible situations. Not that her own plots were particularly credible, but at least in her novels it never snowed in July simply because the heroine\u2019s tears affected Mother Nature. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI have all her novels bound in calfskin editions tooled with gold, with silk inserts and marbled endpapers,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cDang it, I cannot believe I forgot her name! In my favorite, the heroine is almost guillotined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven the fact that you have told me the plot of each and every book you buy,\u201d Vander put in, \u201cI would venture to say that you are speaking of Miss Lucibella Delicosa.\u201d He turned to Mia. \u201cThe travails of Miss Delicosa\u2019s fictional heroines are generally our primary subject of conversation for at least a week after a new novel arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only wish it happened more frequently,\u201d Chuffy lamented. \u201cMy favorite authors are horribly lazy. I\u2019m sure they could write more quickly if they truly applied themselves. At any rate, Vander is right. Miss Delicosa is my favorite novelist, so I order her novels in special bindings. They cost a pretty penny, but they\u2019re worth it.\u201d</p><p>Mia felt herself grinning. She knew to the penny how much her publisher charged for those special editions, because she had authorized production of the three-volume editions at two guineas and five pence, a veritable fortune in the world of publishing.</p> <p>\u201cI gather you have read those novels,\u201d Vander said.</p><p>In that moment, it struck Mia that she had an inspired way to convince Vander that she was not duchess material. \u201cI have a secret identity,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cAre you a French spy?\u201d Chuffy asked, his face lighting up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be absurd,\u201d Vander said, scowling at his uncle, and then at Mia. \u201cWhat in the bloody hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI write novels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Chuffy was clearly delighted. \u201cMy dear, I couldn\u2019t be happier to hear that. I adore novels. Live for them. I can be your muse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a literary muse, Uncle?\u201d Vander was obviously on the verge of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand my point,\u201d Mia said, nettled by his amusement. \u201cNovels are scandalous, and duchesses definitely can\u2019t author books of that nature. Some of my fellow novelists have quite irregular lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Chuffy cried. \u201cDo tell me everything you know! What about Miss Quiplet? I imagine that she is a young lady of great refinement, but of course I have no real idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing of her personal circumstances,\u201d Mia said, \u201cbut I can tell you that the author of Ellen, Countess of Castle Howel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adored that novel,\u201d Chuffy said eagerly. \u201cIt was one of the first I ever read, over five years ago now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLives in irregular circumstances with a vice-admiral,\u201d Mia finished.</p><p>\u201cGoodness me,\u201d Chuffy exclaimed, clearly delighted. \u201cHow do you know? Have you met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrregular circumstances covers so many possibilities,\u201d Vander drawled. \u201cCould you be more explicit so that we can better judge the moral fiber of all living novelists by the vice-admiral\u2019s mistress?\u201d</p><p>Mia scowled at him. \u201cYou may jest, but I assure you that the greater part of Britain considers female novelists to be little better than concubines.\u201d</p><p>Vander looked even more amused. \u201cConcubine is such a delightfully biblical word, isn\u2019t it? Are you saying that the reason I have not yet met a concubine is because I\u2019m not part of a literary set?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are entirely too dismal about the reputation of novelists,\u201d Chuffy said, ignoring Vander\u2019s nonsense. \u201cMiss Fanny Burney was a member of Queen Charlotte\u2019s circle, at least until she married General Alexandre D\u2019Arblay and left the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very good to know,\u201d Vander said. \u201cI have recently realized that I need a connection at court. All dukes should have them, as my solicitor informed me after the debacle of my father\u2019s letter. We\u2019ll forward your manuscript to Her Majesty immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNovelists are scandalous,\u201d Mia told him, marshalling her patience. \u201cMy father was appalled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to say, Lord Carrington showed a great deal of nerve in expressing distaste over fictional exploits,\u201d Vander observed. \u201cAccording to Sir Richard, our marriage is practically incestuous, given our parents\u2019 love affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing of the sort,\u201d Chuffy said indignantly. \u201cWhy, my poor brother wasn\u2019t confined to an asylum\u2014and the late duchess didn\u2019t meet Lord Carrington\u2014until you were well out of short pants, Nevvy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, my point stands,\u201d Vander said, tossing back his drink. \u201cMany in polite society will be so scandalized to learn of our union that they might faint upon encountering one of us unaware. Nothing you can do on the literary front will top what my parents did for the ducal reputation\u2014which we have exacerbated by our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tends to look on the dark side of things,\u201d Chuffy told Mia. \u201cYou must forgive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are underestimating how frightful it would be if my other identity were discovered,\u201d Mia said. She was feeling perversely irritated, because Vander not only wasn\u2019t shocked; he didn\u2019t even turn a hair at the revelation she had a secret identity.</p><p>\u201cVander is right, my dear,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cMy brother and his wife exposed the family to intense scrutiny; your marriage has increased that; frankly, even if you publish a novel one day, it will merely be grist to the mill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I think you should publish,\u201d Vander said. \u201cWhy not? I like the idea that the Duchess of Pindar might be excoriated for something other than adultery. It would throw a luster on the family name that we haven\u2019t managed to this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you assume that I haven\u2019t published a novel?\u201d Mia inquired.</p><p>Vander raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cHave you published a novel?\u201d Chuffy cried. \u201cBecause I assure you that I shall order bindings for your novel that will put Lucibella Delicosa\u2019s to shame! Jewels\u2014or no, velvet with embroidery!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have published several novels,\u201d Mia said, enjoying herself. \u201cSix, to be precise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a published novelist?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>There was a touch of disbelief in his voice that Mia didn\u2019t like. \u201cNot only am I published,\u201d she stated, \u201cbut I am Lucibella herself.\u201d</p><p>Chuffy gasped audibly and put a hand to his chest.</p><p>\u201cSo I cannot possibly remain the Duchess of Pindar,\u201d Mia said, trying to study Vander\u2019s expression out of the corner of her eye. Did he look alarmed? Or did he think she was fibbing? It was hard to tell.</p><p>He definitely didn\u2019t look outraged, the way her father had been when she told him that her first novel had been published (she had decided it was better to ask for forgiveness than permission).</p><p>Given that her audience seemed struck dumb, she added, \u201cIt is only a matter of time before one of my readers discovers the truth about Lucibella\u2019s true identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refer to yourself in the third person?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>At the same moment, Chuffy seized one of her hands and cried, \u201cYou are a treasure! A national treasure! Your books mean the earth to me, and I never thought to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very glad that you enjoy my novels,\u201d she said sincerely.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy them? They have saved my sanity, such as it is. Truly, my dear, in the darkness of the last year, when I lost my beloved sister-in-law and my brother shortly thereafter, your books became my refuge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Mia said, startled by the fervor in his eyes. Readers did tend to confide that sort of thing in their letters, but insofar as she\u2019d always had to conceal her real identity, she\u2019d never before met one.</p><p>\u201cMy refuge,\u201d Chuffy was saying, \u201cand my joy. Where, my dear lady, is An Angel\u2019s Form and a Devil\u2019s Heart? I\u2019ve already ordered it in the matching binding. I\u2019ve been waiting for months!\u201d</p><p>Mia withdrew her hand. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the book is yet unfinished,\u201d she told Chuffy, turning to Vander. \u201cYou must see how impossible it is that I continue as Duchess of Pindar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t take to publishing odes to members of my household, I can\u2019t see that it matters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Matters?\u2019\u201d Mia echoed. \u201cCertainly it matters! I don\u2019t write solemn epic poems or\u2014or historical dramas or great literature. Do you know what Grapple\u2019s Ladies\u2019 Magazine said of my last novel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they said,\u201d Chuffy said instantly. \u201cYour work is genius, my dear, pure genius.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said that it was a mystery that any human being could try to read the book without committing suicide, that\u2019s what they said. They called it a \u2018compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s just unkind,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cI\u2019m quite certain that the reviewer had a depraved home life herself. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t recognize the true goodness of a Lucibella heroine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy books are depraved,\u201d Mia told her husband, who still did not seem to be registering the import of what she was saying.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t read many novels,\u201d Vander said, pouring some brandy into her empty glass and handing it to her, \u201cbut I might start. They sound quite informative. Even inspiring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never read a single novel,\u201d Chuffy corrected.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unfair,\u201d his nephew replied, unperturbed. \u201cOne could make an argument that The Sporting Magazine is akin to a novel: luridly untrue, and fond of recounting unnatural horrors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall sully the Pindar name,\u201d Mia insisted. The brandy was quite good, though she had the vague sense that it was supposed to be drunk only after a meal. Her father had never allowed her to drink spirits, on the grounds she was a lady. She took a hearty swallow, in his honor.</p><p>\u201cVander couldn\u2019t divorce you, even if he wanted to,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to get rid of a wife. There\u2019s many a British peer who has tried, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to read your so-called depravity to judge for myself,\u201d Vander said. \u201cPerhaps I can help you act out scenes for future books.\u201d</p> <p>She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cJust so that you can better visualize them,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no escaping marriage, my dear,\u201d Chuffy said, ignoring Vander\u2019s nonsense. \u201cYour bed is made, so lie in it!\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s eyes had taken on that wicked glint again, and a shock of heat went through Mia. He was just so\u2014beautiful: raw and masculine and proud, even though she\u2019d supposedly defeated him with her blackmailing letter.</p><p>No one could defeat Vander.</p><p>He cocked an eyebrow, as if he could read her mind.</p><p>\u201cNever mind this foolish talk of divorce,\u201d Chuffy said, topping up his glass. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s happened to your new book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t written it yet,\u201d Mia confessed. \u201cThat is, I\u2019ve written bits and scraps of dialogue, but I have a few plot points to resolve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me everything!\u201d Chuffy cried. \u201cI\u2019ll be your muse, your guardian, your mentor, Jonson to your Shakespeare!\u201d</p><p>Mia managed a weak smile. \u201cI would rather not discuss it just yet. I have some delicate aspects left to work out.\u201d She managed to stop herself from adding, \u201caround three hundred pages\u2019 worth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least tell us what happens to the heroine.\u201d Chuffy turned to Vander. \u201cA Lucibella heroine is always in peril. I shiver in terror from the first pages, knowing what\u2019s in store for her. Just give me one hint about the plot,\u201d he implored.</p><p>\u201cHer name is Flora, and she is jilted at the altar,\u201d Mia stated.</p><p>At that, surprise crossed Vander\u2019s face. \u201cAs you were yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe circumstances are entirely different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Lucibella heroine is nothing like our Mia,\u201d Chuffy chimed in.</p><p>Mia winced. If she had ever managed to think well of her figure\u2014not that she had\u2014having near and dear relatives like Vander and Chuffy would clearly knock her down to size. So to speak.</p><p>\u201cThat is true,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, my heroines are invariably and incomparably beautiful,\u201d she explained. \u201cSlender, blue-eyed, all the usual. The genre demands it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are beautiful,\u201d Vander said flatly. Mia blinked at her husband, but he didn\u2019t appear to be mocking her.</p><p>\u201cI generally don\u2019t pay much attention to those parts of the book,\u201d Chuffy said, \u201cbut now I think of it, Lucibella heroines aren\u2019t precisely beautiful. They\u2019re always emaciated owing to their poverty. Sometimes when I finish a book I take a moment to imagine how happy they will be to have all the food they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heroines aren\u2019t emaciated!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarving,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cWhy, one of the heroines floated downstream simply because of all the air in her ribs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe air in her ribs?\u201d Vander repeated, seemingly quite struck.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean ribs. In her stomach, of course! Why, the poor lady had nothing but air in her so she popped to the surface like a bubble. Until a duke towed her to shore, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Vander said, taking another swallow of brandy. \u201cI would hope that any man of my rank would do as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe risked his own life,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cThe adventuresome bits are my favorites. When the duke saw his beloved bobbing downstream like a cork, he dove straight into the river. The icy water closed over his head more than once, but he got her to shore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do the same,\u201d Vander said, grinning widely. \u201cTrained for it from the cradle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy novels have nothing to do with real life,\u201d Mia insisted. \u201cThe fact my heroine is jilted is purely coincidental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with spinning your novels from real life,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cYour life is easily as interesting as those of your heroines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in the last few weeks, I assure you,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cAre all your heroes dukes?\u201d Vander inquired in a way that suggested she may have modeled her heroes on him.</p><p>Which she had.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mia exclaimed. \u201cOf course not. My current hero is a count. At any rate, a title is merely a way of conveying a man of worth and substance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia\u2019s love scenes are famous,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cI expect that\u2019s why that perishing magazine got a little tetchy. Her characters go on and on about how much they adore each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you say they are lyrical?\u201d Vander asked, oh so innocently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia felt helpless, as if she were one of her own heroines, bobbing in a river that was carrying her somewhere beyond her control. Vander was eyeing her in a way that suggested he knew that she had spun him into the heroes of six novels. The only words coming to her mind were profane.</p><p>\u201cYou must have really loved that fianc\u00e9 of yours,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cHere, have some more brandy. I hope you don\u2019t begin writing tragedies now that you\u2019ve been disappointed in love. He was unworthy of you, my dear. You\u2019re better off with Vander, for all he smells of the stables.\u201d</p><p>Mia grabbed onto that lifeline as if it had descended from heaven itself. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve been unable to finish my current book. A broken heart . . .\u201d She let her voice trail off.</p><p>Vander stopped laughing and his eyes went steely. Good. She had suffered all the insults that she could take for one day. Although he did say she was beautiful. She stored that compliment away to think about later.</p> <p>He set down his glass with a sharp click. \u201cHave you any idea as to your former fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said wearily. \u201cHe wrote that he planned to travel to India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope your heroine\u2014Flora, isn\u2019t it?\u2014won\u2019t return to her jilter, any more than you did the blackguard who treated you so rudely,\u201d Chuffy cried.</p><p>\u201cActually, she will,\u201d Mia said. \u201cShe loves the count so much that she forgives him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re damned lucky that Mia was between fianc\u00e9s when she thought of you,\u201d Chuffy said, turning to Vander. \u201cYou never would have found a woman on your own. You\u2019re too wrapped up in those horses of yours, and last time I checked, there ain\u2019t any ladies out in the stables. Damnation, that\u2019s more good brandy I\u2019ve spilled on my coat. I\u2019d better change.\u201d</p> <p>He moved remarkably fast for someone in his cups; he was gone from the room in a moment. Mia was forming the distinct impression that Chuffy was sometimes less inebriated than his consumption implied he should be.</p><p>\u201cYour Charlie informed me that I replaced an earl\u2019s son,\u201d Vander said, taking a swallow of his brandy. \u201cMay I assume that your father did not wave a letter in the man\u2019s direction to inspire a proposal?\u201d</p><p>Mia set down her glass so abruptly that liquor spilled over the rim. \u201cI know that our marriage isn\u2019t what you wish, but I would ask that you not mock me because I was jilted.\u201d She paused and added, \u201cMr. Reeve and I were very much in love, and had been betrothed for months before we were due to wed. I can assure you that he wanted to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me for pointing out the obvious, but his marital intentions are strongly in doubt, considering his absence at the altar.\u201d Vander\u2019s face had taken on that expressionless look again, a trick she suspected he used to mask strong emotion of one kind or another.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Mia admitted. She was still coming to terms with the fact that Edward was not the man she had believed him to be. She seemed unable to find gentlemen as decent and honorable as those she invented; perhaps they existed only in the world of fiction.</p><p>Her readers often complained of the same lack in their letters.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t care about me,\u201d she added, coming belatedly to her own defense. \u201cEdward could not face the responsibility of raising Charlie.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s mouth was tight with disgust. It was a pity because she really liked his mouth. Very few men had that deep lower lip. He would hate the idea, but she thought it softened his face and gave him a deep sensuality.</p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p>She realized it too late. She\u2019d fallen into the same trap again.</p><p>Vander tapped on her nose and she looked up to meet his eyes. \u201cYou escaped that marriage by the skin of your teeth. You see that now, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>Vander stared down at his wife, wondering why he felt such a blistering sense of relief at the unmistakable ring of honesty in Mia\u2019s voice. Why would he care if she was still yearning for a man who wouldn\u2019t have her?</p><p>She was his wife.</p> <p>A novelist? Who would have thought? He knew she was intelligent, but he wouldn\u2019t have dreamt that she had the talent to become a successful novelist. Frankly, that dreadful juvenile poem made it seem especially unlikely.</p><p>Contrary to what she thought, he didn\u2019t give a damn if she was writing depraved novels. Though he would like to read them.</p><p>There was just one aspect of her novels that he had to clarify, though. He moved closer. His hands itched to touch her, but he kept them to himself. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to teach me something about your work. I\u2019ll read one all the way through. And the depraved bits of the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you would do so. My father and brother made no attempt to read them. And despite your uncle\u2019s enthusiasm, I am certain that most of my readers are females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall read one, or even more,\u201d Vander promised. \u201cBut I do have to tell you, Duchess, that you must give up the romantic dreams you have about marriage. I\u2019ll never do any of those other things you envision.\u201d</p><p>She put on a mock shocked face. \u201cYour Grace, are you informing me that you will permit me to go bobbing down an icy river?\u201d</p><p>Vander let out a crack of laughter. \u201cI promise to throw you a rope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d she said, looking away. \u201cI\u2019d sink like a stone anyway.\u201d</p><p>The image of Mia floundering in an icy river was surprisingly unpleasant, so Vander barreled on. \u201cI was referring to romantic gestures like the dukes in your novels probably make. Bringing you posies, writing poetry, showering you with jewels. Your father was constantly giving my mother litters of glass animals. I will never do anything of that nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said readily.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have that marriage.\u201d He caught her eyes, because this was truly important. \u201cWe can have much more, Duchess. That romantic claptrap is for novels, not for life. For dreamers, like Chuffy. Like my mother, for that matter. She satisfied herself with glass steeds, when there were flesh-and-blood horses in the stables.\u201d</p><p>Mia gave a tight little nod.</p><p>Satisfied, he recognized that they had reached the point in a negotiation at which his opponent understood that there was no logical reason to continue arguing: Vander was going to win.</p><p>On all points.</p><p>She would capitulate now, and agree to live with him as his wife.</p><p>But she surprised him, raising that firm little chin in the air. \u201cTo be perfectly honest, even though you are forcing me to remain your wife, I do not intend to beg you for those four nights. Ever.\u201d</p><p>That was a facer, not merely because his body was pulsing with desire to possess his bride, but because he did need an heir at some point. He let some of that desire show in his eyes. \u201cWhat if I begged you?\u201d</p><p>Her expression did not change an iota. \u201cI will say no. This afternoon I came to understand that I cannot fight the fact you are using Charles Wallace to ensure that I acquiesce to our marriage. I made myself vulnerable through my own actions. But you placed yourself at my mercy when you wrote that contract specifying that we would be together only on the nights I implored you to join me.\u201d</p><p>A reluctant grin touched Vander\u2019s lips. He had just come face to face with a negotiator who had adroitly circled around behind his defenses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And bested him.</p><p>If he was honest with himself, in some twisted way he had been looking forward to the four nights with Mia.</p><p>Of course, that was when he had believed she adored him. When he believed that he would be doing her a favor. He had felt an errant pride that a woman\u2014any woman\u2014had loved him to the point at which she would go against her own moral code in order to bed him.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been dreading the marriage bed. No, he had pictured himself looming over Mia, her curls spread across the pillow, eyes soft with desire and love, rounded body his and only his. She would be ecstatic because she was finally his.</p> <p>Wrong.</p><p>This woman\u2019s mouth was set in a firm line and her eyes were fierce.</p><p>Very wrong.</p><p>\u201cAll I ask is that we revisit the issue in a year or so,\u201d he said. \u201cAt some point I must produce an heir. There is no particular urgency.\u201d</p><p>Mia frowned. \u201cI suppose we could consider it once we are better acquainted. But Your Grace, I beg you to rethink your decision about this marriage.\u201d</p> <p>Why the hell was she so reluctant? It must be the fianc\u00e9. Maybe he was one of those pretty men. Vander knew perfectly well that there was a brutal shape to his chin, and an energy about him that women either loved or loathed.</p><p>\u201cYou are my wife,\u201d he stated, \u201cand you shall remain my wife. We should have a conversation about Sir Richard\u2019s litigious intentions, as well as about management of the Carrington estate.\u201d He saw exhaustion in her face, so he added, \u201cbut that can wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelashes flickered. \u201cWill I be part of management of the estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Unless you\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father did not believe that a woman could have a head for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven what I\u2019ve paid for Chuffy\u2019s novels, I would venture a guess that your career is quite profitable.\u201d</p> <p>A smile lit her eyes. \u201cMy father told me that I could keep my pennies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always thought he was an ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not say that. But we often did not agree about business matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really one of the most popular novelists in England?\u201d</p><p>Pink came up in her cheeks. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrava,\u201d he said sincerely. Suddenly his body was more aflame than he could remember being; something about Mia\u2019s combination of sensuality and intelligence was wildly arousing. Bedding her would be the key to turning their marriage into the comfortable arrangement he had envisioned. Only it would be even better than he had thought, because he now respected her reasons for forcing him to marry.</p><p>After spending the afternoon with Charlie, he knew already that he\u2019d blackmail the king himself to ensure his new ward\u2019s safety.</p><p>Once he managed to seduce Mia, he would dispense with the four days proviso and give her access to his bed whenever she wanted.</p> <p>Hell, maybe he would even let her sleep with him. He had never slept with a woman, but he was warming to the idea of reaching for Mia in the middle of the night.</p><p>Rolling over and sliding his hands between\u2014</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I will retire and have a light supper in my chamber,\u201d Mia said. \u201cThe brandy went to my head and besides, I have a letter to write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Vander said, thinking that perhaps they could eat together in his bedchamber. It would be a prelude to eating in bed.</p><p>Before he could put the idea into words, Mia withdrew, nipping out of the room. He almost started after her, but thought of the blue shadows under her eyes and stopped himself.</p><p>His wife would be his wife for years.</p><p>He thought he might like her to kiss him goodbye when she was leaving a room. Her lips were . . . delectable.</p><p>They could work on that later.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>NOTES ON JILTING SCENE</p><p>Flora has to confront Frederic or seem a jelly-boned coward.</p><p>She should toss her prayer book to the side and tell the jilting faithless count exactly what she thinks of him, that sniveling, dribbling, dithering, palsied, pulse-less man.</p><p>Flora waited at the altar, her graceful hands clutching the prayer book that her dying moth\u2014</p><p>Count Frederic walked into the church, and Flora knew instinctively, with just one look at his devilish black eyes, that he intended to humiliate her in the worst possible way, in front of the whole of the beau monde. She hurled her prayer book like a discus, knocking him to the ground.</p><p>Then she walked over his prone body on her way out the door.</p><p>This isn\u2019t working.</p><p>Mia awoke the next morning feeling much better.</p><p>Few women would complain about being married to a wildly handsome duke. Though they might grumble about Vander\u2019s ready agreement to forego consummation of their marriage.</p><p>She would have put it down to dislike of her figure, but although Vander thought she was dumpy, he had kissed her that one time. Well, two times.</p><p>Men were like that, by all accounts. Merely being in the vicinity of a woman made a man eager to bed her. It was interesting to discover that her governess had been correct in that respect.</p><p>She rang the bell for Susan and walked into the bathing chamber, only then making an important discovery. A door on the opposite wall from the bathtub almost certainly opened into Vander\u2019s room. And Mia couldn\u2019t see a hook that would prevent him from walking straight into the chamber while she was bathing.</p><p>Naked and surrounded by all those mirrors.</p><p>That would absolutely not do. Hooks must be installed immediately. In the meantime, she made Susan stand guard before that door while she bathed.</p><p>Sometime later she made her way down to the breakfast room, finding it empty but for Nottle.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Your Grace,\u201d the butler said. \u201cMay I offer my felicitations on your wedding?\u201d</p><p>The words dripped with insincerity, but Mia chose to ignore his tone. \u201cThank you, Nottle. On another note, I should like someone to install locks on the inside of the doors in my bathing chamber. Both the doors leading to my bedchamber and to the duke\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be quite certain that I understand Your Grace,\u201d Nottle said in a wooden voice. \u201cYou wish to have locks nailed onto both sides of the bathing room doors? Those doors were imported from Venice, where they graced a three-hundred-year-old palazzo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Those doors,\u201d Mia confirmed.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t immediately agree, she asked, \u201cPerhaps you would be happier if His Grace confirmed my request?\u201d It appeared that Nottle felt that her rank was trumped by her sex.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d he said, as if butter wouldn\u2019t melt in his mouth. Mia wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but she disliked melted butter.</p><p>And Nottle.</p><p>She moved toward a chair to sit down, but the butler said, \u201cIf you will forgive me, Your Grace, I have an urgent domestic conundrum on which I would request your guidance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Mia said, turning back. \u201cOf course, Nottle. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe late duchess\u2019 animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those glass ornaments,\u201d she said, understanding his problem. \u201cThey must be very tiresome to dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was referring not to the collection, but to her canines,\u201d he said, with a pained expression.</p><p>\u201cWinky and Dobbie!\u201d Mia exclaimed. \u201cOf course I remember her dogs. Dobbie must be getting on in years. What became of them in the last year?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGenerally speaking, they have been confined to the gardener\u2019s shed. And, on occasion, the potato cellar,\u201d he added.</p><p>Mia frowned. \u201cWhy on earth are they in a shed? They\u2019re used to having the run of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would ask you to bend your eye to the carpet in this room.\u201d</p><p>Through a triumph of will, Mia did not roll her eyes, but instead looked down at her toes. \u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSilk, woven in the mountains of the Kashmir,\u201d the butler said, his voice exhibiting signs of enthusiasm for the first time. \u201cNot only are claws deleterious, but I regret to inform you that in the wake of the duchess\u2019 passing they developed a propensity for unconstrained urination.\u201d</p><p>Mia took a moment to work out what he was saying. \u201cThey were probably in shock! And no wonder, if you confined them to the potato cellar. Did the duke approve of this treatment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not disturb His Grace with domestic arrangements,\u201d the butler said loftily.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even ask him?\u201d</p><p>Nottle\u2019s eyes shifted. \u201cThe duke has no interest in such trivial matters. However, as it has transpired, His Grace accompanied Lord Carrington to the kitchens for a late-night snack, and the dogs were discovered. I should be most grateful, Your Grace, if you could ensure that the animals are confined to the nursery at all times. I will have the carpet in that room taken up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWinky and Dobbie will not be confined to the nursery, any more than they should have been in a cellar,\u201d she told him. \u201cAccidents will cease as they grow calmer.\u201d</p><p>If possible, the butler\u2019s long face grew even longer. \u201cAm I to understand that the rugs are hostage to the emotional state of those animals? May I have your permission to keep them confined until they achieve a point of serenity, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne might almost think you were trying to be humorous, Nottle,\u201d Mia said. But it was clear he was not. She sighed. \u201cThe dogs will reside with Charlie; since he is unlikely to spend much time downstairs, the carpets will be protected.\u201d</p><p>Nottle inclined his head, apparently mollified. \u201cPerhaps you can inform me, Your Grace, what sort of accommodations we should make for your ward, given his . . . condition.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s eyes narrowed. Was that revulsion she detected? She gave him the benefit of the doubt. \u201cMy nephew is somewhat restricted in his movements, but he never causes trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was wondering whether some of the chambermaids who do not have strong stomachs should be reassigned.\u201d There was a look in his eyes that confirmed he would prefer that Charlie live in the potato cellar to the nursery.</p> <p>With this, Mia\u2019s previous doubt was erased. Her face must have conveyed a warning, because he added, \u201cFor the good of the young master, of course. No one would want him discomfited by the foolishness of a country girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018The foolishness of a country girl,\u2019\u201d Mia repeated. \u201cWhat precisely do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>The butler looked down at her from his considerable height. \u201cThis household prides itself on overlooking disagreeable particulars whenever possible. It is the way of the Dukes of Pindar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand there have been more than enough to avoid,\u201d Mia said. \u201cBut I am the current Duchess of Pindar. Are you telling me that you foresee maids fainting at the mere sight of Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne would hope not,\u201d Nottle said. \u201cBut one must be awake to such possibilities, given the child\u2019s malformation.\u201d</p><p>Mia came to an abrupt decision.</p><p>\u201cYou are dismissed,\u201d she said, pulling herself up as tall as she could, which unfortunately was only to his armpit. \u201cI am letting you go. If the duke wishes to furnish you with a recommendation, that will be entirely up to him. But I would like you gone by noon.\u201d</p><p>Mia had dismissed only two servants before, in both cases for stealing. And in both cases, the servant in question had responded with every sign of guilt.</p> <p>Nottle did not adhere to that pattern.</p><p>He too pulled himself upright until he towered over Mia\u2014obviously using his height to try to intimidate her\u2014and announced, \u201cI have served the Dukes of Pindar since I was eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, His Grace must see virtues that I do not,\u201d Mia snapped. \u201cHe can enumerate them in his letter of recommendation. But no one in this household will retain his or her position if my nephew is treated with even the slightest sign of disrespect. You might wish to impart that to the household, Nottle, before you pack your belongings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see what His Grace says to this,\u201d the butler said, his voice all the nastier for verging on a hiss.</p><p>A sound came from the open door behind him and Chuffy walked into the breakfast room, clapping his hands lightly. \u201cCome, come, Nottle. You don\u2019t really think that a newlywed duke will countermand his wife\u2019s control in domestic matters, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is unconscionable,\u201d Nottle said, for the first time looking a trifle disconcerted.</p><p>\u201cI shall not stand up for you,\u201d Chuffy advised. \u201cI don\u2019t care for the way you look at me when I\u2019ve had a drop more than is advisable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that I have never offered you the least offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019d be mistaken. I think you\u2019re often offensive when you believe you aren\u2019t,\u201d Chuffy retorted. \u201cCome now, my dear, would you like a glass of Canary wine? It\u2019s just the thing to settle a morning stomach, I find.\u201d</p><p>Mia discovered that she was shaking. She wasn\u2019t used to this sort of confrontation. She retreated out the door Chuffy had just entered, followed\u2014to her dismay\u2014by both men.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I must return to my chamber for a moment,\u201d she said to Chuffy, ignoring Nottle. She walked back up the stairway, keeping her hands in front of her so that neither man could see they were trembling.</p><p>Upstairs, she darted back into the room, closed the door, and leaned against it. Susan looked up in surprise. She was unpacking the trunks that had arrived the night before, carefully putting Mia\u2019s gowns in the clothes press.</p><p>\u201cGoodness, my lady,\u201d Susan asked, \u201cwhatever is the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just dismissed Nottle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d her maid cried.</p><p>\u201cI let him go,\u201d Mia said, sinking into a chair. \u201cI told him to be gone by noon.\u201d Her heart was still racing. \u201cIt was dreadful, Susan. He initially refused to leave until he\u2019d spoken to the duke, but mercifully, Sir Cuthbert was very supportive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Cuthbert is a drunkard, but a sweet one, by all accounts,\u201d Susan said, dropping the gown she was holding onto the bed and coming over. Her face was alive with curiosity. \u201cWhat on earth made you so angry at Mr. Nottle? Mind you, I don\u2019t care for him. He thinks entirely too much of himself. You\u2019d think he was the duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was rude about Charlie,\u201d Mia said. \u201cBeastly, really. He implied that the chambermaids would faint at the sight of his foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is beastly.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s heart was beginning to slow. The dark, frumpy gowns lying on the shelves of the clothes press caught her eye and she made another lightning decision. \u201cI need some new gowns, Susan, made from silk, in beautiful colors.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d be damned if the floors of Rutherford Park were better dressed than its mistress.</p><p>Susan beamed. \u201cNow that Sir Richard isn\u2019t holding the purse strings, you can order whatever you wish. You\u2019re a duchess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d Mia said. She had never really bothered about clothes before. Charlie didn\u2019t care what she looked like, and she hadn\u2019t wished to spill ink on expensive fabrics. Ever since the season in which she debuted\u2014only to be roundly ignored by all eligible young men\u2014she had lived quietly at home, occasionally attending local assemblies, but rarely venturing to London, and never into high society.</p><p>But she felt shaken by Nottle\u2019s contempt. She had a shrewd feeling that her wardrobe had something to do with his attitude, though her father\u2019s relationship with the late duchess likely lay at the heart of the problem.</p> <p>Susan veered back to the topic of the butler. \u201cIt was terribly ill-bred of Mr. Nottle to oblige the grooms to talk about His Grace\u2019s fisticuffs with Sir Richard. Mr. Gaunt would never allow such gossip. Mind you, Mr. Gaunt had a way of making his feelings known: he never cared for the way Master Charles Wallace\u2019s mother used to shudder if she caught sight of him. But he wouldn\u2019t say anything aloud.\u201d</p><p>That particular memory confirmed Mia\u2019s impulsive decision to get rid of Nottle. Poor Charlie had put up with disdain from his mother; he needn\u2019t face the same from the butler.</p><p>\u201cLast night Nottle said at the supper table that Master Charles had a flipper instead of a foot,\u201d Susan said, both hands on her hips now. \u201cI said as how he was utterly wrong about that, and he told me to shut my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Mia felt as if there wasn\u2019t enough air in the room. It wasn\u2019t merely the confrontation with Nottle; it was all too overwhelming. \u201cSusan,\u201d she said desperately, \u201cI cannot stay married to the duke.\u201d</p><p>Her maid plopped down on the bed. \u201cWhy not? He\u2019s a fine figure of a man, and the household likes him. That says a good deal. And now you\u2019re a duchess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a duchess! I never did.\u201d</p><p>Susan scoffed at that. \u201cThat\u2019s like saying you hate diamonds. Only a witless woman would say that she doesn\u2019t want to be a duchess. You can have all the gowns you want.\u201d</p><p>Mia shrugged.</p><p>\u201cAll the books you want,\u201d Susan added. \u201cAnd the young master can have a tutor again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Grace thinks I\u2019m dumpy,\u201d Mia said, coming out with the truth of it. \u201cAnd fat.\u201d</p><p>Susan\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe thought I was carrying a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was able to disabuse him of his error,\u201d Mia said miserably. \u201cBut I dislike the idea of being married to him. He\u2019s too handsome, Susan. There\u2019s a disbalance between us that cannot lead to a happy marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you wearing the blue merino when he said that? It does bunch up under the bosom. I\u2019ve always said that Mrs. Rackerty down in the village should keep to her garden.\u201d She hesitated, and added, \u201cI noticed that he didn\u2019t visit your bed last night, though it was your wedding night.\u201d</p><p>Of course she\u2019d noticed. Servants saw everything. \u201cWe\u2019ve decided to put the business of making an heir off for a good period of time. Years, most likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not fat,\u201d Susan stated firmly. \u201cYou have lovely curves. We shall have to prove him wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDumpy is another word for short. I\u2019ll be known as the Dumpy Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d Mia was actually a little hurt. Susan had been her maid\u2014and, in practical terms, her only female friend\u2014for three years.</p><p>Susan pulled Mia until she was standing before the glass. \u201cYour dress goes up to your collarbone,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>Mia nodded. \u201cI like it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd these extra ruffles at the shoulders do you no good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo balance my breasts. They\u2019re too large.\u201d</p><p>Susan\u2019s eyebrow shot up. \u201cIs that why you always want ruffles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would you if you were short and had cabbages in front. You\u2019re a full head taller than I am, Susan, and you have no idea what it\u2019s like to be my size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to be your size. Particularly in front.\u201d She plucked at her bodice. \u201cLook at me. I have almost nothing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApple dumplings, not cabbages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why are you talking about food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to draw attention to my bosom. I\u2019m too short for dresses that catch up under the breasts. They\u2019re made for ladies with long legs, while on me, they billow out and make it appear that I\u2019m carrying a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour legs are nicely shaped,\u201d Susan said. \u201cAs are your ankles. I think we should order a scandalously short gown with almost no fabric in the bosom.\u201d</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou are married now. You have to dress like a duchess: \u00e0 la mode, not behind by two years.\u201d She plucked at the ruffle. \u201cOr ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will make no difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCostly gowns make all the difference. We could leave for London tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Susan nodded vigorously. \u201cIn order to visit a modiste. You know my sister Peg is in service with Lady Brandle. When I visited Peg last month, we discussed every modiste in the city of London, and I know precisely whom we should see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. My novel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband neglected you on your wedding night,\u201d Susan said, her voice sharp. \u201cNo woman should stand for that. We\u2019ll transform you into a woman so exquisite that the duke will beg for entry to your chamber.\u201d</p><p>Mia liked the idea, though she didn\u2019t believe it possible. \u201cI can\u2019t go to London. You know Charlie doesn\u2019t like to travel, and I am certainly not leaving him alone in a strange house while I gad about to buy some new ribbons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need more than ribbons!\u201d Susan cried.</p><p>\u201cI thought I might go for a ride,\u201d Mia said, changing the subject. \u201cDo you happen to know whether Lancelot was delivered last night? I\u2019m not hungry for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Susan confirmed, \u201cwhich reminds me, you need a new riding habit as well.\u201d</p><p>Mia nodded, painfully aware that her habit had apparently shrunk, as the fabric was straining at the brass buttons that ran down her front, which lent even more emphasis to that area.</p><p>\u201cNow that you are no longer plain Miss Carrington,\u201d Susan said thoughtfully, \u201cyou might be able to summon a modiste to Rutherford Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would come here, to the country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall offer double.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble?\u201d</p><p>Susan put her hands on her hips. \u201cMy lady, your husband did not even attempt to join you in bed last night, did he?\u201d</p><p>Mia frowned at her. \u201cMust we go around and around on the same topic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right gown will make you irresistible,\u201d Susan promised.</p><p>In Mia\u2019s expert opinion\u2014as a novelist who had crafted three Cinderella transformations\u2014that was as improbable as snow in July. But she couldn\u2019t help it. A germ of hope sprang up in her heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>MORE NOTES ON FLORA</p><p>~ Problem: Flora is boring. Too like a hearth rug. She should issue set-downs. \u201cYou flea-bitten fungus!\u201d</p><p>~At least defend herself.</p> <p>The vapid Mrs. Dandylion (shrilly): \u201cDon\u2019t count your chickens before they are hatched!\u201d</p><p>Flora: \u201cI am happy to say that I would not recognize a chicken, nor do I own any. Obviously our social spheres have been quite, quite different.\u201d</p><p>Readers might think she is overly tart?</p><p>She must be sweet.</p><p>Vander\u2019s stable was nothing like the simple enclosure at Carrington House. It was four times the size, with a wide, spotless central corridor and elegant stalls over which horses stretched their heads. Each stall had a brass plate engraved with the horse\u2019s name. And each horse was more graceful than the last.</p> <p>\u201cWatch that one, Your Grace,\u201d Vander\u2019s stable master, Mr. Mulberry, said, touching Mia\u2019s arm and nodding to their right. \u201cHe\u2019s new to the stables, and he\u2019s proven to have a terrible temper. He bit one of the stable hands in the arse, and the lad will have a scar to the day he dies.\u201d</p><p>The horse poked his head out to look at her. He was an amber chestnut color, with a black mane and a rather sweet tuft that fell over his eyes. Muscles rippled as his powerful neck curved over the door of his stall. His eye caught hers. It was dark brown, ferocious, wild.</p><p>Mia froze. \u201cHe\u2019s the size of a house,\u201d she breathed. She vastly preferred the size of her mount, Lancelot; he was as stubby as she was. She was terrified by large horses.</p><p>\u201cSixteen hands,\u201d Mulberry confirmed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJafeer. That means \u2018the sound of the wind,\u2019 in the language of Arabia. His Grace imported him at great expense on the basis of his bloodlines, but no one can tame him. He\u2019s stopped eating. Doesn\u2019t like England is my guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, dear, that\u2019s terrible,\u201d Mia exclaimed. Luckily, that would never happen to her horse, because Lancelot liked eating more than anything in the world. She doubted he would even notice if he was moved to a different country, as long as they grew oats there.</p><p>\u201cI put your mount in the stall beside Jafeer, as he seems unlikely to be riled by all the carryings-on next door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing riles Lancelot,\u201d Mia confirmed.</p><p>Mulberry was trying to guide her past Jafeer\u2019s stall, but she halted. \u201cIf I approach him, what will he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely start kicking his stall,\u201d the stable master said. \u201cPlease, Your Grace, don\u2019t do that. I have twenty-four animals here, and they all grow upset when Jafeer tries to escape, which is all he\u2019s been doing for the last five days.\u201d</p><p>Mia nodded and edged past. Lancelot didn\u2019t look up as they approached; he was taking a nap, his head hanging.</p><p>\u201cCould Lancelot have a brass nameplate too?\u201d she inquired. \u201cI know he\u2019s not of the quality of the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Grace will undoubtedly procure a new mount for you without delay,\u201d Mulberry said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a new horse,\u201d Mia told him. Lancelot was just right for her. He resembled a sofa with legs. Short legs.</p><p>Sir Richard had sold all the horses belonging to her father and brother, claiming that Charlie had no need of them. He would have sold Mia\u2019s horse too, but for the fact no one thought Lancelot was worth more than a shilling.</p><p>\u201cHe and I have been together for years,\u201d she said, reaching out to tug on Lancelot\u2019s forelock.</p><p>Lancelot ignored her, keeping his eyes shut. He had a strong belief that inertia was better than movement.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s awake,\u201d she told Mulberry. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to leave the stables, but if you pull him out of his stall, he\u2019ll become livelier.\u201d</p><p>Mulberry looked dubious, but he opened the stall door and dragged Lancelot away.</p><p>Mia was about to follow when she noticed that Jafeer had moved to the closest side of his stall and was staring at her, his brown eyes bright and curious.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look wicked or wild anymore. He looked interested.</p><p>She took a step toward him and he bent his head and whickered. There were times when the only thing that would get Lancelot moving was a piece of apple, which meant Mia\u2019s pockets were full of them.</p><p>She held one out to him and he lipped it delicately from her palm. \u201cAre you as fast as the wind?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He jerked his head up, almost as if he were answering her. \u201cYou are not the horse for me,\u201d she told him, because he had begun snuffling her hair, almost as if he were flirting. \u201cYou\u2019re taller than any horse should be. And you\u2019re as fast as the wind, remember? I don\u2019t even care to trot.\u201d</p><p>Mulberry reappeared at the far end of the aisle. Mia quickly backed up before she could be caught. Jafeer made a little sound in his throat, as if he were disappointed, which was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d Mia said. She turned and began walking toward the open door. Immediately she heard the bellow of an infuriated horse. Whirling, she saw Jafeer rise up on his back legs, come back down and give the back of his stall a vicious kick.</p><p>Without thinking, she marched back and said, \u201cYou stop that immediately!\u201d</p><p>He was rearing up; his front hooves thumped back to the floor and it seemed to her that he had a guilty look in his eye.</p><p>\u201cYou know better than to make trouble like that.\u201d</p><p>Jafeer arched his neck again, reaching over the door to snuffle her hair.</p><p>Mia patted his muscled neck tentatively. He was lipping her curls and threatening to make her hair fall from its pins, so she gave him another piece of apple. He ate it enthusiastically, and then with a gusty blow of air from his nostrils his large head came down and rested on her shoulder.</p><p>Mia remained still, raising her hand to scratch around his ear. He moved his ears forward and back, and sighed once more, an unmistakably contented sound. After a moment, Mia stepped back and put both her hands on his face, looking into his eyes.</p><p>They stared back at her, liquid and sweet. \u201cYou are nothing more than a fraud,\u201d she said. \u201cAren\u2019t you? You aren\u2019t unmanageable at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Mulberry said from just beyond her shoulder. \u201cPlease step away slowly. I warned you about that horse. He bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d she said, reaching up to scratch Jafeer above the eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s as sweet as Lancelot, just less sleepy.\u201d</p><p>Jafeer gave another gusty sigh and closed his eyes, letting her scratch his brow. His eyelashes were long and curled at the ends. \u201cI think he\u2019s lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? He just wanted someone to pay some attention to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace, he has had attention,\u201d the stable master said in a stifled voice. \u201cThe horse cost hundreds of guineas, so he\u2019s not only had the attention of the duke, but all of us in turn have attempted to calm him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t try the right way?\u201d Mia suggested. \u201cHave you tried apples?\u201d She reached in her pocket and took out another piece of apple. \u201cLook, he loves them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we try apples?\u201d Mulberry sounded stupefied. \u201cYour Grace, we have tried every conceivable kind of vegetable and fruit, the best oats, specially made bran-and-mash. Do you see his ribs? That horse has been starving himself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia let go of Jafeer and rose on her toes to look over his door. He instantly backed up to give her room.</p><p>Sure enough, his manger was full of oats. \u201cJafeer,\u201d Mia said, pointing to the box. \u201cYou must eat.\u201d</p><p>He made a funny noise, almost as if he were talking to her.</p><p>Mia leaned against the door. \u201cI suppose I could stay here for a little time,\u201d she told him, \u201cbut I must go for a ride. Lancelot is waiting for me.\u201d Jafeer bent his head and began to lip up the oats.</p> <p>\u201cWell, damn my britches,\u201d Mulberry exclaimed, instantly adding, \u201cPlease excuse me, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Mia laughed. Jafeer had obviously remembered how delicious oats were; Mia patted his neck and he raised his head and whickered at her, but lowered his head again immediately.</p><p>After a few minutes, Mia made her way out to the paddock. Mulberry hoisted her onto Lancelot\u2019s broad back just as a groom emerged from the stable on his own mount. Mia\u2019s heart sank. She was desperate for escape, and the last thing she wanted was the quizzical gaze of a bored young groom as she and Lancelot meandered down the path, stopping now and then, which allowed Lancelot to fortify himself with some grass due to the unwonted exercise of carrying her.</p><p>\u201cI have no need for an escort,\u201d she told Mulberry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have wasted your time,\u201d she added, nodding to the groom.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Mulberry objected, \u201cyou cannot think to go for a ride without an escort.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I intend,\u201d she said. When he started to protest, she drew herself upright. She might as well practice looking like a duchess. \u201cI shall ride alone,\u201d she stated. \u201cI shall return in an hour or thereabouts. Good afternoon, Mulberry.\u201d</p><p>With that, she pointed Lancelot toward the open gate. He ambled through it, resigned to the fact that she was forcing him to take her for a ride.</p><p>Mia leaned forward and patted his neck. \u201cGood boy, Lancelot.\u201d Behind her she heard Jafeer\u2019s infuriated bellow and the pounding of hooves. He must have realized that she had left while he was eating.</p><p>She followed a path that wound from behind the stables, skirted the edge of the lawns and wandered off into the woods. The moment she was out of sight of the looming house Mia felt as if she were finally able to breathe. It was as if she\u2019d been swept up in a whirlwind, only to find there was no air in the middle of the storm.</p><p>A short time ago, she\u2019d been in the local church, waiting to become Mrs. Edward Reeve, when Sir Richard had announced that Edward had fled, and she had instantly plunged into a panic from which she had yet to emerge.</p><p>In the last weeks, her every muscle had remained taut with fear. Now she could relax. Whatever happened to her, Charlie would be secure, financially as well as physically. Vander would prudently administer the estate, not like Sir Richard, who would have wasted Charlie\u2019s patrimony in frivolous lawsuits.</p> <p>Vander would never do that, and Edward wouldn\u2019t have either. For the first time she let herself really think about the fact that her fianc\u00e9 had left the country rather than marry her.</p><p>Her throat tightened. It felt terrible.</p><p>Edward had kissed her as if he meant it. After their first kiss, he had pulled back, laughing. And yet he looked at her in such a way . . .</p><p>Obviously, desire was not enough to ensure loyalty. She had believed Edward loved her, but in hindsight, he had been temporarily lustful. Like Vander.</p><p>For a moment she wobbled in the saddle, struck by the realization that someday Vander would take a mistress, a beautiful sylphlike woman, someone he might love the way Thorn Dautry loved his wife.</p><p>Tears began to slide down Mia\u2019s cheeks. There was a reason she wrote Lucibella novels: she longed to be loved, and to fall in love.</p><p>Her father hadn\u2019t been adept at paternal duties. But he had loved the late Duchess of Pindar. He was happiest dancing with Her Grace. Mia had seen him circling the dance floor a hundred times, his hair gilt-bright in the light thrown from chandeliers, proud to be holding his love in his arms.</p><p>The memory made the tears come even faster. She had hoped\u2014dreamed\u2014that someday she would love someone with the same passion, but within the bonds of marriage. She hadn\u2019t felt overly ardent with Edward, but she had genuinely liked him and she had been certain they would grow to love each other with time.</p> <p>Now, if Mia were ever to experience love, it would have to be adulterous. Her love would be tarnished like her father\u2019s, hemmed in by shame.</p><p>She closed her eyes and let Lancelot go where he would as an occasional sob wracked her chest. She came back to herself only when they stopped moving.</p><p>The first thing she saw, blurrily, when she opened her eyes was a large hand holding Lancelot\u2019s reins. She looked slowly from the hand past an expanse of fine wool, a strong jaw, blue eyes. Angry blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Vander barked. He had maneuvered his horse beside Lancelot\u2019s side in order to grab the reins. His leg was touching hers.</p><p>There was no point whatsoever in trying to pretend otherwise. \u201cCrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone riding with closed eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cYour horse could have tripped on a mole hole. Though he\u2019s so stubby that you likely wouldn\u2019t have suffered injury. I must get you a decent mount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLancelot is a perfect horse for me,\u201d Mia managed, blotting her tears with a damp handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you attempt nothing faster than a walk,\u201d he said in a jaundiced tone. Men tended to be unkind to Lancelot. Mia had never succeeded in convincing her brother that she had no need to trot, and that therefore Lancelot\u2019s sluggishness was irrelevant.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Vander thrust a large white handkerchief toward her.</p><p>Mia took it, glancing sideways. He was as exquisite as ever, whereas she was tear-stained and disheveled.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She defiantly blew her nose as no lady would do in a gentleman\u2019s presence, and tucked away his handkerchief to give to Susan. \u201cI apologize for causing you concern, Duke.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cWhat made you cry?\u201d</p><p>To reveal to him that she was grieving for the love affair she would never have was out of the question. \u201cI was thinking of my father.\u201d Vander was staring at her chest, or possibly her middle, so she straightened her back, rather than sit in the saddle like a bag of flour.</p><p>\u201cYour father was a cicisbeo with nothing better to do with his time than dance attendance on my mother in her bedchamber, adulterously, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father loved your mother! It might not have been right, but that\u2019s . . . that\u2019s the way it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was his mistress,\u201d Vander said, his voice cold. \u201cShe lent him consequence while they cuckolded my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very vulgar way of putting it,\u201d Mia said, jerking herself straight again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll return to the stables,\u201d she said. She pulled at her reins, but Vander didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>His leg brushed hers again as his mount shifted uneasily. \u201cI gather you terminated Nottle\u2019s employment this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Mia said. \u201cHe was very unkind while speaking about Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Chuffy said. Nottle has been with the family for years, so I dispatched him to do his butlering at the townhouse. I\u2019m rarely there, which will suit him fine. And I sent a groom over to ask your Mr. Gaunt to join us. He should do well.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a brilliant solution,\u201d Mia said with relief. \u201cCharlie will never go to London, and they needn\u2019t encounter each other.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cWhy would you say that? Of course, Charlie will visit the townhouse. But believe me, Nottle will never say an untoward word about your nephew again, upstairs or downstairs. He knows full well that he will leave without a letter of recommendation if I hear a whisper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent!\u201d Mia said, giving him a beaming smile. \u201cI try to surround Charlie with positive influences at all times. He can learn about the world\u2019s cruelties when he\u2019s older.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018When he\u2019s older,\u2019\u201d Vander echoed. \u201cHow much older?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwenty, perhaps? As long as I can possibly shield him. And now he has you as well!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t,\u201d Vander said flatly.</p><p>Mia\u2019s heart fell to her feet. Vander was forced into marriage; he was hardly likely to take on the role of guardian with any sort of enthusiasm. \u201cOf course, I understand. If you\u2019ll excuse me, Duke, I shall return to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t understood me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think that you\u2019re the first who found Charlie too much of a burden?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI only meant that I will not join you in coddling your nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI understand. I\u2019ll return to the house now.\u201d She had had all the marital conversation she could put up with. Besides, she could feel the heat of his leg through the skirts of her riding habit and it muddled her brain.</p><p>With one swift movement, Vander dropped both his and her reins, caught her around the waist, lifted her from her sidesaddle, and pulled her up and over until she was seated in front of him.</p><p>Mia gasped. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her silently, and then his mouth came to hers, the kiss open-mouthed, as if they were speaking to each other. Her right side was plastered against Vander\u2019s chest and he had one of his hands tangled in her hair, and his tongue . . .</p><p>Feeling swept through her body, crashing into her like a thunderstorm.</p> <p>The way two tongues met . . . it was carnal. She had clutched his coat, certain she was about to fall; now her fingers curled into thick, soft hair.</p><p>Another moment, and parts of her body were hotter than others. A sound like a growl came from Vander\u2019s throat. Mia responded as if a piece of silk were being drawn across her naked body.</p><p>She pressed even closer and Vander\u2019s grasp tightened. Mia melted against him as if she had no bones. As if he could do whatever he wished to her.</p><p>Then he stopped. \u201cAny interest in requesting one of those allotted nights?\u201d he asked, his eyes impenetrable.</p><p>It took her a moment but she croaked, \u201cRequest? Don\u2019t you mean that I should beg for a night? Never.\u201d</p><p>With one swift movement, he deposited her back in her saddle. It was lucky that Lancelot\u2019s back was broad, because she might have toppled straight off the other side. Her knees felt wobbly.</p><p>No matter how wonderfully Vander kissed, there was nothing particularly interesting about him.</p><p>If she told herself that enough times, she might come to believe it. She looked up at Vander again, and opened her mouth to say as much, but somehow everything had changed again.</p> <p>When he had tossed her back onto Lancelot\u2019s back, her skirt had caught around her knees, and now her legs\u2014clad in pale pink silk stockings\u2014were exposed right up to her thighs, and creamy flesh above that. Vander\u2019s eyes were smoldering, as if he wanted not just to kiss her, but to do something truly scandalous. Heat surged up her middle as she pulled her skirts back down.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello!\u201d A deep voice broke the moment as effectively as a rock might smash a window. \u201cWho have we here? Well, if it isn\u2019t the newlyweds, having a little t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Chuffy,\u201d Mia said, managing a smile.</p><p>The muscle was working in Vander\u2019s jaw again. Mia felt a perverse stab of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, my dear,\u201d Chuffy asked. \u201cShall I continue to the village by myself, Nevvy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll be off,\u201d Mia said hastily.</p><p>Vander\u2019s eyes narrowed again. \u201cI just realized . . . Where\u2019s your groom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI chose to ride alone,\u201d Mia said. \u201cGoodbye.\u201d She would have liked to gallop down the path, but she knew better than to try. There was silence behind her as she and Lancelot plodded away, which gave her time to wonder whether her bottom looked absurdly round in her tight habit.</p><p>Vander was probably watching her go and wondering if she even had a waist.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t turn to look. She mustn\u2019t.</p><p>She had almost reached the curve in the pathway when she heard the rumble of Chuffy\u2019s voice. \u201cGal has extraordinary hair. Took that from her father, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>She rounded the bend and brought Lancelot to a halt, dying to know what Vander would say in return. Chuffy continued, \u201cI\u2019m never certain of my gossip, but isn\u2019t she the one who was madly in love with you when you were only a lad? I couldn\u2019t remember for sure.\u201d</p><p>Mia froze. All she could hear was her own breath, choppy bursts of air; she missed Vander\u2019s response entirely.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that, lad,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cRight about that. You\u2019re a duke, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the title.\u201d</p><p>Oh good. At least Vander recognized that she hadn\u2019t been\u2014</p><p>\u201cBut yes, she used to be in love with me,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cNot pretty enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s heart thumped.</p><p>\u201cShe had a round face in those days, and I was fifteen,\u201d Vander said flatly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in young ladies of quality, any more than I cared for poetry.\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched. That self-righteous, bumptious ass. He had yanked her onto his horse, for goodness\u2019 sake.</p><p>He had kissed her, round face and all, not the other way around.</p><p>Mia had heard enough. She loosed Lancelot\u2019s reins and the horse ambled on, swishing his tail. She didn\u2019t deserve this sort of treatment. She may not be the prettiest girl in the world, or even in the country, but no one except Vander had ever made her feel downright homely.</p><p>After the poetry incident, she had tried a thinning regimen, but all it did was whittle her waist, which made her breasts seem even larger. In short, this was as alluring as she was ever going to get.</p><p>Damn it, she was crying again, so hard this time that she began hiccupping.</p><p>Marriage was awful.</p><p>She hated it . . . nearly as much as she hated her husband.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>From the offices of Brandy, Bucknell &amp; Bendal, Publishers</p><p>September 10, 1800</p><p>Your Grace,</p><p>I write to offer the most hearty congratulations of myself and my partners on your recent nuptials.

He\u2019d left Chuffy in the alehouse surrounded by a ring of his cronies.</p><p>When he had returned to his stables, he had found Mulberry buzzing with excitement\u2014about his wife. Jafeer was calmer in Mia\u2019s presence? Mia, who rode a horse that moved like an ancient turtle, stiff-legged and slow?</p><p>Moreover, he couldn\u2019t get their kiss out of his head. Most of his life, Vander had been attracted to tall, slender women. But now he was struck with raging desire for a woman who nestled into his shoulder. A woman who wasn\u2019t even tall enough to look him directly in the eye. Who could be plucked from her saddle and kissed until both of them were breathless.</p><p>When Mia was irritated, her eyes darkened to a wintery green color that he\u2019d never seen on another woman.</p> <p>Suddenly Vander realized his valet was offering a waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Do you know how my new ward fared in the nursery this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>His man grinned. \u201cFrom everything I hear, he\u2019s a character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Gaunt is another one. He sat the household down and gave us all a good talking-to about how we\u2019re to treat Master Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Vander said with satisfaction. \u201cWas there rejoicing below stairs at the departure of Nottle?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly not.\u201d But a momentary pause had told Vander exactly what he needed to know; he made a mental note to retire Nottle to a cottage on his Yorkshire estate.</p><p>He turned to shrug on his evening coat. \u201cThe duchess has summoned a modiste from London,\u201d his valet reported. \u201cHer lady\u2019s maid is quite happy that Her Grace has decided to put aside her half-mourning.\u201d</p><p>It seems his wife had truly mourned the death of her father. Vander didn\u2019t like how much her tears had affected him. Mia\u2019s soft mouth had quivered, and he\u2019d wanted to kiss her until she trembled all over for a different reason. The moment he\u2019d realized she was crying, he had wanted to take her into his arms and kiss her until she cheered up.</p><p>Absurd. He never felt that sort of thing, and he\u2019d be damned if he let himself be disturbed by a wife, let alone a wife whom he hadn\u2019t chosen for himself.</p><p>Not that he was complaining, he had to admit. Every time he saw Mia, his desire spiked higher. That was useful, insofar as they would have to come together enough times to create an heir and a spare.</p><p>Perhaps even a daughter. For a moment he imagined a little girl with Mia\u2019s extraordinary hair and green eyes, and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Four nights . . .</p><p>He suppressed a bark of laughter.</p> <p>It would take him more than four nights to get her out of his system.</p><p>A few minutes later he entered into the drawing room and was amused to find Mia in a high-necked, ruffled gown that resembled the garb of an elderly housekeeper. It didn\u2019t matter. He took one look at her, and his cock stood to attention.</p><p>She was wearing her hair tumbling down her back with a bandeau holding it off her face. It suited her. With those big eyes, heart-shaped face, fly-away eyebrows . . . and hell, those lips . . .</p><p>Interestingly enough, Mia seemed to have no idea how beautiful she was. He was used to women who were polished and pruned, ruthlessly displaying their best assets in the marketplace.</p><p>The mere act of watching Mia\u2019s throat ripple as she swallowed her wine excited him. Gaunt offered him a glass of claret. He took the glass and strolled toward his wife, adjusting his coat in order to conceal the situation below. \u201cGood evening, Duchess,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mia did not meet his eyes. \u201cGood evening, Duke,\u201d she murmured. Her nose had a perfect shape. It wasn\u2019t bulbous or too pointed, as many women\u2019s noses were.</p><p>\u201cI have a question about your father,\u201d he said, deliberately bringing up a subject that would create some distance between them.</p><p>Sure enough, her brows furrowed. \u201cI do not wish to discuss my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he give your poem to my mother?\u201d</p><p>Mia finally looked at him. Her gaze felt like a hot poker that sent blood straight from his head to his toes, most of it pooling halfway between, if he were honest.</p><p>\u201cHe thought the poem was funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI presume you didn\u2019t give him a copy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father had idiosyncratic ideas about ownership. He was also irrepressibly curious. That is undoubtedly how he came into possession of the letter your father wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo other letters of that nature exist?\u201d he asked. \u201cHave you a safe crammed with people\u2019s secrets?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered almost imperceptibly. \u201cNo. The theft of the poem was partly my fault, because I titled it in such a way that you were identifiable. I should have known he would find it irresistible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have minded less if you had titled the poem to Evander. I\u2019ve always hated my middle name.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth curled slightly. \u201cAt the time, I found Septimus a far more romantic name than Evander.\u201d</p><p>She turned away and walked to a settee. Despite himself, Vander\u2019s eyes followed her bottom. She had the most luscious arse that he had ever seen. Round . . . perfect.</p><p>To go with her perfect nose.</p><p>He followed her and dropped into a chair opposite, taking another swallow of wine. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019d prefer Septimus to Vander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cI think you were right to request that we not address each other in such familiar terms. Whether or not our marriage survives\u2014\u201d She saw he was about to speak, and raised a hand. \u201cMy point is that neither of us wishes the other to develop an unwise affection.\u201d</p><p>Vander was suddenly quite convinced that he\u2019d like his wife to develop just such an affection. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><p>A ripple of pain went through her eyes. It instantly disappeared, disguised by a veneer of well-bred courtesy.</p><p>\u201cI gather you cannot imagine the situation in which you would fall in love with me,\u201d she said, chin high. \u201cBut what if I were to fall in love with you, Your Grace? Again? I think we can both agree that it would be better to avoid that unfortunate situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings,\u201d he said, the words coming out in a husky caress.</p><p>\u201cYou did not hurt my feelings,\u201d she answered readily. \u201cI am well aware of the differences between us, Duke. You do me no harm by reminding me to keep them in mind.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. Differences? But before he could ask her to elaborate, Chuffy toddled in. His uncle wasn\u2019t three sheets to the wind, as the saying went: he was more like six sheets.</p><p>\u201cEvening, love birds,\u201d he said, turning on his heel and looking behind him, for all the world like a puppy looking for its tail. \u201cHave you seen that new butler of ours? He was here just a moment ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vander reached over and pulled the cord. \u201cHis name is Gaunt, Chuffy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d his uncle said. \u201cYou\u2019d never know it by his stomach these days, but he used to be the boxing champion for this county, Nevvy, as you\u2019d know if you weren\u2019t all-fired up over stables, stables and nothing but stables.\u201d</p><p>Mia was smiling, so presumably she already knew the origins of her butler\u2019s crooked nose.</p><p>Damn it, one glance at her, and lust slashed through him again.</p> <p>She was his wife. She was his.</p><p>She would love him.</p><p>Again.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>MORE NOTES ON THE JILTING</p> <p>~ Perhaps Frederic is inebriated and forgets to come to church?</p><p>\u201cFrederic keenly felt the impropriety of his conduct. \u2018Now I am myself again, no longer under the Dangerous Influence of Spirituous liquors . . . my affections suppressed by Demon Rum, I forgot the most precious gift that Life had given me.\u2019\u201d No. (Readers wouldn\u2019t like it.)</p><p>Perhaps he accidentally tips Flora over a waterfall.

A deceitful friend tells him that Flora is naught but a wanton deceiver. Yes, this works!</p><p>Very Shakespearean ~ wasn\u2019t that Much Ado about Nothing? Or Measure for Measure?</p><p>Mia was beginning to feel that she would deserve a medal if she survived the meal. There wasn\u2019t much conversation; Sir Chuffy was humming to himself, and Vander was eating a beef steak in the devotional way that men eat large slabs of meat.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t stop worrying about the question of intimacy\u2014and she didn\u2019t mean first names. When she and Vander did consummate their marriage, which was bound to occur at some point, she would insist that all the lamps be extinguished first. No candles either. Sheets pulled up to their chins.</p><p>Was it permissible to insist that a man not touch his wife above the waist? She had a feeling it wasn\u2019t, though she didn\u2019t really know. Not having known her mother, she had only foggy ideas about the finer points of conjugal intimacy.</p><p>Enough! They had to talk about something.</p><p>\u201cI met Jafeer today,\u201d she said brightly.</p><p>Vander looked up from his plate. \u201cSo Mulberry informed me. Don\u2019t go near that horse. He\u2019s far too high-strung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather Jafeer is a new addition to your stables?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he arrived a few days ago,\u201d Vander said, taking another forkful of beef.</p><p>\u201cYou did tell me that you had a race upcoming, did you not? Will he take part?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought to enter him because he has been unsettled. He won races in his native country as a yearling, and I\u2019d like to have a sense of what he\u2019s like on the track. But perhaps I shall . . . now I know that the way to his heart is a duchess with a pocketful of apples.\u201d</p><p>Mia knew she was beaming, but it felt wonderful to triumph where Vander\u2019s stable master had failed.</p><p>\u201cGood for you, m\u2019dear,\u201d Chuffy said, leaning back with an expansive wave of his glass. He nearly tumbled but caught himself. \u201cYou\u2019ve deduced the way to your husband\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s eyes narrowed. He probably thought she was trying to trap him into unwanted emotion by befriending Jafeer\u2014when she\u2019d had nothing like that in mind. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to go to such lengths, Duchess,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI\u2019m bought and paid for.\u201d</p><p>Mia froze, unable to speak. Chuffy, on the other hand, made a sharp gesture and barked, \u201cNevvy, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His chair toppled backward with a crash, and a hard thump indicated that Chuffy\u2019s head had hit the floor. Mia sprang to her feet with a squeak of distress, but Vander merely leaned forward far enough to peer down at his uncle and got up in a leisurely way.</p><p>Mia rushed around the table to where Chuffy was lying on the floor. To her relief, he was blinking up at the ceiling, looking surprised rather than injured.</p><p>\u201cHere I am, on the damn floor again,\u201d he observed.</p><p>Vander hoisted Chuffy to his feet and deposited him back in his chair. \u201cHaving second thoughts about our marriage?\u201d he asked Mia in a mocking tone, as he walked back to the head of the table. \u201cThis household does not fit the mold of the beau monde.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a restorative,\u201d Chuffy said, hauling on the cord to summon Gaunt.</p><p>\u201cIf I had dreams of a life in the beau monde,\u201d Mia managed, \u201cI gave them up long ago. If you would both please excuse me, I shall retire for the night.\u201d She stood up and nipped out the door as Gaunt entered, running up the stairs to the nursery.</p><p>The ducal nursery was three times larger than that in Carrington House. It was bright and airy, with a rocking chair with metal mounts and red velvet cushions. A sofa was positioned in front of the fireplace, which was fronted with an elaborate grate guard.</p><p>In the corner was a child-sized iron cot; next to it was a child-sized wash table and basin. Charlie was in bed, but when she tiptoed into the room, she could tell that he was awake. She sat down on his bed, leaning over to kiss his forehead. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asleep, Barley Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too excited,\u201d he whispered. He sat up. \u201cUncle Vander is going to teach me how to ride, Aunt Mia! He\u2019s going to teach me to ride a horse. And he showed me how to go downstairs all by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Charlie grabbed her hand and put it against the inside of his thin knee. \u201cDo you feel this?\u201d</p><p>He pushed against her hand, and she nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat means I can ride a horse!\u201d he said triumphantly.</p><p>Mia\u2019s heart sank. \u201cHoney, riders use these things called stirrups\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA true rider needn\u2019t use them,\u201d Charlie said fiercely. \u201cYou can ride a horse with your knees. The duke says that is the best way to ride. You don\u2019t need feet; you only need strong legs.\u201d</p><p>Mia opened her mouth and shut it again. She was hardly someone who knew the finer points of horsemanship. \u201cI suppose you could ride Lancelot.\u201d</p><p>Charlie shook his head. \u201cI shall ride proper horses, starting with a pony named Ginger, and after her, the biggest horses in the duke\u2019s stables. I shall ride them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Mia moaned. She knew that look. She\u2019d seen it on her own face, when she\u2019d realized that if she wrote novels and published them under an alias, she could keep writing about love without risking humiliation.</p><p>Charlie\u2019s face was small, but all of a sudden she saw that it was no longer delicate. His chin was square and his eyes were fierce.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re growing up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, unable to keep a smile from her lips.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m growing up,\u201d Charlie told her. \u201cAll boys grow up. I shall go away to school soon. It\u2019s going to be an adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t!\u201d she cried, the denial coming straight from her heart. \u201cWho told you such a thing? Did the duke say that?\u201d</p><p>Charlie snuggled back into his covers. \u201cYes, he did. He\u2019s going to send me to his school. It\u2019s called something funny . . . like Eating. I think that\u2019s it. He\u2019s sending me to Eating.\u201d His eyes were growing slumberous.</p><p>\u201cEton,\u201d Mia mumbled, shocked down to her toes. Her baby would never go away to school, where cruel boys like that dreadful Oakenrott would taunt and bully him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She would throw herself in front of the carriage first. Had she done this? By marrying Vander, she had ensured that Charlie would endure agonies of humiliation, not just once, but every day, for years?</p><p>No.</p><p>Charlie\u2019s eyes opened again. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me a baby, Aunt Mia,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI have to grow up.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was thudding in her throat. Her marriage wasn\u2019t consummated. Charlie might be better off with Sir Richard. At least Sir Richard would keep him in the house, rather than throwing him onto the back of a horse or sending him away to school.</p> <p>No. She had been right to get Charlie away from Sir Richard, no matter what.</p><p>Charlie had fallen asleep, so she reached out and smoothed the hair that tumbled over his brow and tiptoed from the room. She had to think, but Susan was straightening her bedchamber. She needed a place where she was unlikely to be disturbed.</p><p>Suddenly she remembered Jafeer. He was as distressed and lonely as she was. It took her a while to find a side door, but finally she slipped into the night. It was warm outside, and the sky was full of stars, like shining cherries in a bowl.</p><p>She walked the path to the stables, letting the evening air wrap around her shoulders. Weren\u2019t lamps dangerous in a stable? Yet the building was illuminated inside as if by daylight, and as she approached, she heard a shout.</p><p>Followed by the high whinny of an enraged horse.</p> <p>\u201cOh for goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d she said, under her breath.</p><p>Still, she felt better. Someone needed her. Vander didn\u2019t care to have her around, for obvious reasons, and Charlie was growing up.</p><p>A couple of grooms came running toward her, down the corridor away from Jafeer\u2019s stall. They tried to stop her, but she brushed past them.</p><p>A moment later she stood in front of the stall. The stallion\u2019s eyes were wild, rolling, both ears flat back, his hide blackened with sweat. Mia put her hands on her hips. When he was two years old, Charlie had gone through a spell when he would lie on the nursery floor and scream.</p><p>Jafeer, she decided, was having a tantrum. Just as she had with Charlie, Mia waited until she caught Jafeer\u2019s eyes. Instantly, the wild loneliness drained out of his expression, and he brought his front legs to the floor with a thud.</p><p>The groom who had been hauling on his reins, trying in vain to control the horse, let out a string of thankful curses, turned, saw her, and started.</p> <p>\u201cYour\u2014Your Grace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJafeer,\u201d Mia said, \u201cjust what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>The horse blew air and shook his head. He wasn\u2019t going to throw in the towel immediately. It was all her fault, apparently.</p><p>Mia stepped forward. \u201cCome here,\u201d she said, reaching toward him.</p><p>He held out for another moment, letting her know that she shouldn\u2019t have abandoned him in a strange place where men shouted at him. With a huge sigh he lowered his head to her.</p><p>Mia reached her arms around his neck. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t behave this way,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if I can sleep in the stables with you.\u201d</p><p>As if he could understand her, Jafeer gave a little snort and lipped at her hair. Susan had left it down in a style that she swore was all the mode, but Mia thought was merely untidy.</p><p>She drew away. \u201cThere\u2019s entirely too much light here,\u201d she said, turning to address the stable hand. \u201cOh, Mulberry, there you are! Wouldn\u2019t it be better to extinguish the lamps? Look at poor Lancelot. He wants to go to sleep.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Lancelot was asleep. It would take more than a terrified, homesick horse in the stall next door to keep him awake.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known that stallion needed a duchess to make him happy,\u201d Mulberry said, \u201cI never would have recommended we buy him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably just a woman\u2019s touch,\u201d Mia said, even though she didn\u2019t like that idea. Jafeer was hers.</p><p>Mulberry shook his head. \u201cNo, Your Grace. Since you were here this morning, we tried all the scullery maids, the downstairs maid, and one of the dairymaids. I tried to lure the cook, but she wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>Mia ran Jafeer\u2019s velvety ear through her fingers. \u201cI can\u2019t remain in the stables with you all night, silly boy. Mulberry, if you would be kind enough to extinguish all but one of the lamps, perhaps I can quiet him enough to sleep.\u201d She turned her face and dropped a kiss on the horse\u2019s whiskery nose. \u201cYou\u2019re sleepy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d The Arabian\u2019s eyes drooped. It couldn\u2019t be easy having a daylong tantrum.</p><p>Charlie used to drop to sleep like a stone after his fits, back when he was two years old.</p><p>One by one the lamps were turned down and the stable descended into near-darkness. The men all left, with Mulberry the last to go.</p><p>Finally it was just the two of them. Well, the two of them and two dozen other animals, slowly breathing in a warm darkness that smelled like horses and clean straw.</p><p>Mia unlatched the door to Jafeer\u2019s stall and entered. The moment she was next to his head, he folded up his long legs and collapsed like a house of cards.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep,\u201d Mia said, in a calm low voice. She sat on the floor next to him and leaned against his shoulder. He curved his neck around her, and she stroked his cheek. \u201cPretty soon I shall have to leave, and you will sleep through the night. I\u2019ll visit you in the morning, and perhaps again in the evening.\u201d</p><p>Jafeer\u2019s head slid off her shoulder to the straw as he fell asleep.</p><p>Mia just sat, hand on his neck, thinking about her life. She had sacrificed everything for Charlie\u2014her self-esteem, her self-respect, her chance at a happy marriage. But it had been the right thing to do; even thinking about his shining eyes made her smile. He wanted to learn to ride, so she\u2019d have to allow it.</p><p>Ever since the moment when she\u2019d realized that her newborn nephew might die due to his mother\u2019s extravagant use of opium during birth, and the doctor had chosen not to rouse the baby because of his deformity, she had taken responsibility. It began when she upended a pitcher of water on the baby\u2019s head and woke him up from an opium-induced daze.</p><p>As Mia saw it, there were times when only one possible road lay ahead, and so she had snatched Charlie from the arms of the nurse. And eight years later, she had faced a similar conundrum, and married Vander.</p><p>She leaned back against Jafeer, pushing the subject of Vander out of her mind.</p><p>Perhaps the count jilted Flora because he was an inveterate inebriate, along Chuffy\u2019s lines? But there seemed to be so much pain behind Chuffy\u2019s drinking . . . she couldn\u2019t manage it if Frederic was in that sort of emotional state.</p><p>Novels weren\u2019t like real life.</p><p>The darkest problems were like syphilis and lice. She couldn\u2019t touch them, not in the pages of her books.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>DRAFT: WEDDING</p><p>Having grown up in an orphanage, Flora\u2019s knowledge of the marital state is near to non-existent. The image of a gentleman on his knees knocked together in her head with a vision of herself in a silk gown, being served by a liveried butler footmen in livery.</p><p>Flora had long dreamed of a man in an exquisite coat who would sit beside her, vowing eternal adoration.</p><p>She had never imagined this . . . this agony.</p><p>With trembling fingers she unwrapped the screw of paper the priest handed her, his face riddled with compassion.</p><p>(\u201cRiddled\u201d sounds as if he has pox, which no man of the cloth should have.) </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With trembling fingers, she opened the sheet of paper. The words danced before her eyes. Black dots swam before her eyes.</p><p>Frederic had changed his mind.</p><p>Vander stared at the dining room door as it closed behind his wife, and felt a leaden sense of guilt settle in his gut. For a moment, before Mia smiled insincerely and bade them goodnight, he had seen misery in her eyes.</p><p>Misery.</p> <p>He had done that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a horse\u2019s ass,\u201d Chuffy confirmed. He had taken up his fork again and spoke through a mouthful of beef. \u201cI know she blackmailed you and all the rest of it, but your bed is made, lad. What are you going to do, spend your whole marriage sniping at her? She doesn\u2019t even fight back. It\u2019s hardly a fair fight.\u201d</p><p>Mia hadn\u2019t fought back. A wooden look had slid over her face that he didn\u2019t like. Not at all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to give you some lessons in how to deal with women,\u201d Chuffy said, waving his fork. \u201cGod knows, your mama was unusual, which is probably why you don\u2019t understand \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnusual?\u201d Vander said, bristling. \u201cI don\u2019t think she was unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Chuffy frowned at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your meaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was unfaithful to your brother,\u201d Vander said. \u201cShe took a lover and cuckolded him in plain sight of all society. There\u2019s nothing unusual about that.\u201d</p><p>Chuffy put his fork down. \u201cThat\u2019s taking the ugliest possible look at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other way is there?\u201d Bitterness swelled in Vander\u2019s heart. \u201cI watched her, Chuffy. I saw my mother swan around ballrooms on that man\u2019s arm. He would stay for months, sitting in my father\u2019s place at the table. Even when I was still in the nursery, I knew it was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Whenever his father was to be released from the private asylum, Lord Carrington would vanish back to his own estate. Vander had never spoken to his father about what happened during his confinements.</p><p>If the duke had known that every time he fell too deeply into melancholia to bathe himself, after he was banished to the asylum again, Lord Carrington would stride back into the house, a shock of golden-gilt hair waving above his forehead . . . It would have been terrible.</p> <p>So Vander had unwillingly become a party to deceiving his father. A party to adultery.</p><p>\u201cIt was complicated,\u201d Chuffy said, interrupting his thoughts. \u201cI suppose we should have discussed this earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to discuss,\u201d Vander stated.</p><p>Chuffy rose and went to the sideboard, retrieved the bottle of wine, and poured it into the glass he\u2019d carried with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to summon Gaunt to pour,\u201d Vander snapped.</p><p>\u201cAre you really going to try to turn your house into a ducal establishment?\u201d Chuffy asked. \u201cBit late for that.\u201d</p><p>That was true. Vander liked to work in the stables all day. He didn\u2019t care to change for the evening meal, though he\u2019d done it today. He had married a woman who dressed like an elderly housekeeper. His uncle was drunk most of the time.</p><p>\u201cI suppose not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI loved my brother,\u201d Chuffy said, leaning back against the sideboard and sipping his wine. \u201cWhen we were young, he was like a god to me: always telling stories, getting into trouble and talking his way out, dragging me along even though I was much younger.\u201d</p><p>Vander nodded. \u201cThank you for that.\u201d He stood. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Chuffy cut him off. \u201cI will not.\u201d</p><p>Vander instantly froze. Before this damned marriage, no one\u2014ever\u2014told him what to do. He was not only a duke; he had made thousands of pounds training, racing, and betting on his horses. He commanded, rather than the other way around.</p><p>\u201cNephew,\u201d Chuffy said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, sitting down again. \u201cI apologize. I\u2019m at your service.\u201d He could do this. He hated more than anything to discuss his parents, but he owed this courtesy to his uncle.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s illness came on when he was fifteen, though we didn\u2019t understand it at the time,\u201d Chuffy said, rolling his glass between his hands. \u201cHe started staying up all night, telling mad stories that would go on for days. At first, I stayed up with him. But I couldn\u2019t . . .\u201d He was silent for a moment. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep up with him. He would take a horse and ride all night long. When we were in the house in Wales during the summer, he would dive from cliffs and swim back around to the village. You know how long a swim that is, lad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could easily have died,\u201d Vander said, frowning. \u201cHe must have been mad already. Of course, he was mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Chuffy took a gulp of wine and started turning, turning his glass again. \u201cHe began to grow angry, flaring up between one word and the next. It wasn\u2019t him, not really. He was never like that as a boy. He was always at my shoulder, defending me.\u201d</p><p>Vander nodded. \u201cHe lost his temper with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, I thought it was my fault,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cThat if I could somehow be a better brother, more quiet, more helpful . . . he wouldn\u2019t grow enraged. But he always did. The anger, the blows, would come out of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>Vander stood again. He didn\u2019t know what to do or what to say. He wasn\u2019t the sort of man who knew how to console another.</p><p>Damn it, a tear was sliding down his uncle\u2019s cheek. \u201cI was relieved when he married and moved out of the house,\u201d Chuffy whispered. \u201cMy own brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone would understand,\u201d Vander said, moving around the table to put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cMy father was out of his mind. Cracked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe turned from me to your mother,\u201d Chuffy said, his watery eyes meeting Vander\u2019s.</p><p>Vander suddenly went cold all over.</p><p>\u201cI was so grateful for my release . . . but it just meant that he turned that anger against her. Didn\u2019t you ever wonder why you never had a sibling? Or why your mother never conceived a child with Lord Carrington, since they were together more than twenty years?\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s jaw tightened. He didn\u2019t like where this conversation was heading.</p><p>\u201cAfter you were born, she couldn\u2019t have any more children, because your father\u2014my brother\u2014took that away from her.\u201d Chuffy\u2019s voice was low, tortured.</p><p>Vander turned away instinctively, stumbling as he did.</p><p>\u201cWith his fists,\u201d Chuffy added, taking a deep gulp of wine.</p><p>Vander\u2019s gut convulsed and, unable to help himself, he threw up on the floor.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Chuffy muttered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d He grabbed a cloth from the sideboard and tossed it over the vomit.</p><p>\u201cI should have known.\u201d Vander took a glass of water from the table. \u201cHow could I not have seen it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it,\u201d his uncle said urgently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault, lad. The madness would take over . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d Vander put down the empty glass and strode to the door. In the corridor, he paused and said, \u201cGaunt, I was sick on the floor. Please convey my apologies to whomever cleans it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fish soup!\u201d the butler exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, the soup was excellent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chuffy followed him to his study, clutching the bottle of claret in his hand. \u201cYou always had that trick of throwing up at bad news,\u201d he said, leaning against the doorframe.</p><p>Vander frowned. He had no particular memories of vomiting.</p><p>\u201cYou were a bellwether for my brother\u2019s madness,\u201d his uncle said. \u201cWhen the mania came on, I knew you would lose your meal. I think it saved your life a time or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely not,\u201d Vander said, his voice rasping.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone tried to protect you, of course, but you were small, and children are terribly fragile, aren\u2019t they? My brother insisted on going into the nursery, no matter how many footmen were stationed at the door. Mind you, he didn\u2019t mean it. He had delusions, you see. Sometimes he thought it was his duty to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Vander searched his memory. \u201cI remember he once mistook me for a burglar . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we told you.\u201d Chuffy\u2019s voice was so sad that Vander could hear the tears. \u201cYet he loved you, and your mother, and me as well.\u201d</p><p>Vander cleared his throat. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough.\u201d He met Chuffy\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe may have loved us, but he didn\u2019t protect us. He didn\u2019t make certain that we were safe. Quite the opposite, it seems.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Chuffy\u2019s mouth twitched. Regret and shame were battling in his uncle\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you told me,\u201d Vander added.</p><p>That was a lie.</p><p>Chuffy nodded and upended the bottle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the stables,\u201d Vander said, and escaped past him into the entry, then out the front door into the shadowy darkness.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>NOTES ON FREDERIC\u2019S REPENTANCE</p> <p>~ day after Frederic cruelly leaves Flora at the altar, his deceitful friend breaks down and confesses that Flora had never kissed him.

Sets out on foot, following stories of a Divinely Beautiful woman in tattered wedding dress, begging for bread.</p><p>Vander headed down to the one place in his world where everything made sense, only to be met on the way by Mulberry. A moment later he was running down the path toward the stable. What in the hell was Mia doing, going near that horse again?</p> <p>He\u2019d made a mistake in buying Jafeer. The animal had clearly been part of a herd, and some horses never recovered after being separated from their family. It was rare, but it happened.</p><p>He pushed open the door and ran toward Jafeer\u2019s stall. He didn\u2019t see Mia, and his imagination presented him with an image of his wife crumpled under the horse\u2019s hooves. The double flip his heart took startled him, but there she was.</p><p>His duchess was curled up against the shoulder of the most unpredictable stallion that his stables had ever housed. She was fast asleep, as was Jafeer, looking more peaceful than he had since his arrival in England.</p><p>In the wan light of a single lamp, Mia\u2019s skin against her dark-colored gown was as white as porcelain but warmer, silkier. Golden hair had fallen all around her shoulders, curling like the wood shavings the grooms shoveled into horses\u2019 stalls.</p><p>She probably wouldn\u2019t like that idea, but it was true. Shavings were gold and amber and even buttercup yellow, and her hair had all those colors as well.</p><p>But what really caught him was how small she was. Curled up like that, her brave, independent eyes closed, she looked fragile. Which made a rush of protectiveness go through him like a streak of lightning.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d he whispered. He had to get her out of the stall. She didn\u2019t stir, so he walked in quietly, bent down, and collected her into his arms.</p><p>She weighed about as much as a chicken. Maybe a newborn foal. And she felt good in his arms. She must be exhausted, because she didn\u2019t wake. Her cheek fell against his chest and she nestled in as if he\u2019d been carrying her around for years.</p><p>He backed out of the stall and carefully maneuvered the gate shut with his knee, quietly enough that neither horse nor lady woke. Then he set off toward the house.</p><p>Granted, he knew nothing about flowers, but he was reasonably certain that she smelled like honeysuckle. Honeysuckle with a dash of vanilla.</p><p>Halfway up the house, she stirred, and her brows drew together as if, in her dream, she was scolding him. Her eyes flew open and she gasped, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrying you back to the house,\u201d Vander said. His hands tightened around the soft, fragrant bundle in his arms.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about Chuffy\u2019s revelations. He\u2019d rather think about the fact that for the first time in his life, he had someone who was his and his alone, inadvertently or not.</p><p>Mia.</p><p>\u201cPlease put me down immediately,\u201d his wife said. Her body had gone tense, which wasn\u2019t as nice as when she had cuddled into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI enjoy carrying you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI neglected to carry you over the threshold yesterday,\u201d he told her, enjoying the stern tone in her voice, \u201cso I might as well do it now.\u201d</p><p>She attempted to twist free. \u201cI\u2019m not a toy, Duke.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw set. Damn, but she had the prettiest face he\u2019d ever seen. It wasn\u2019t angular and stern the way some women\u2019s were. At the same time, he could see strength in every contour.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you are acting this way,\u201d she said in a chilly voice.</p><p>\u201cCarrying you?\u201d</p><p>They were coming up to the wall of the house now. It had been constructed of blocks hewn by some distant ancestor (or, more likely, his serfs); just looking at the stonework was calming.</p><p>His father and mother were gone, and with them, all the pain and turmoil of their lives. He was married to the pocket Venus he had in his arms, and someday they would have babies, one of whom would be his heir.</p><p>Given the way Mia calmed Jafeer, their children would have the same tingle in their hands and bones that he had: a tingle that told him a particular yearling would race to win, whereas another colt was innately indolent and would do better pulling a dog cart.</p><p>He pushed open the swinging door to the deserted kitchens and walked in, belatedly realizing that Mia was still talking and that her voice was rising. \u201cI\u2019ll put you down as soon as we are upstairs,\u201d he told her. For the first time in days, Vander felt happy.</p><p>He liked Mia\u2019s softness, her curves, her perfume . . . everything about her. He backed through the door to his bedchamber, which fortunately was empty.</p><p>Mia was getting red in the face and thrashing about, so he finally put her down. She whipped around, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cJust what do you think you\u2019re doing, manhandling me like that?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Vander grinned. \u201cCarrying my wife up the stairs.\u201d He moved nearer to her, wondering how a disheveled woman wearing a grain sack with a ruffled neck could make his entire body taut with lust. \u201cI think we should pretend this is our wedding night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She backed away. \u201cOur marriage will remain unconsummated until I beg for one of my allotted nights, don\u2019t you remember?

He had Mia, and he was going to keep her. That asinine rule about four nights had to go.</p><p>\u201cThat is not in your purview. I am not requesting a night. In fact, I will never beg for a night with you.\u201d She darted to the door leading to their shared bathing chamber. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d She tugged on it in vain.</p><p>Vander strolled over. \u201cIt must be hooked from the inside.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is the idea of keeping your husband out of the chamber when you\u2019re in the bath.\u201d If he hadn\u2019t already had an erection, he would at the thought of Mia\u2019s creamy skin slick with water.</p><p>She apparently decided there was no point to further discussion, because she headed for the door to the corridor.</p><p>Vander caught her by the waist and spun her about until their bodies were aligned. Instantly she stilled, her eyes caught by his. A deep certainty swelled in his chest, even as his body throbbed with desire. It was a certainty that felt as right as spring rain, as momentous as when the first horse he trained won a race.</p><p>They were married, and Mia was his, and that was significant. It wasn\u2019t just a matter of papers and negotiation.</p> <p>There was something about it. Chuffy\u2019s song tumbled through his head: Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty . . . Youth\u2019s a stuff will not endure.</p><p>Vander brought his mouth down to hers, and it was just like the last time they kissed: passion flared so high and fast that it felt tangible. Actually, it was tangible, in the hard length that pressed against her softness.</p><p>His mouth demanded . . . hers opened. Threaded into the rough, sensual joy of it was his hunger and desire.</p><p>His hands slid down her back and pulled her closer. He was shaking with lust, but he had enough sense to realize that Mia was no longer trying to escape, or caviling about those four nights. She was kissing him back, her tongue curling around his in a way that sent fire through his blood.</p><p>Voluptuous curves melted against his body. His hands slid further down her body and he hoisted her up, swinging around until her back was against the wall, supporting her weight so he could ravage her mouth without bending his head.</p><p>She made a soft sound. He felt like a madman, overwhelmed by desire. Her eyes opened . . . they were heavy-lidded, sensual, desirous. A shudder went through him.</p> <p>\u201cWill you please request one of those nights?\u201d he whispered. Before she could answer, he bent his head to kiss her neck. He wanted to lick her all over, drive her to writhe under him, make her gasp and call his name.</p><p>The thought of her open lips as cries broke from her throat drove him an inch further toward insanity. \u201cEvery time I touch you, I feel like a madman,\u201d he muttered. Had there ever been such a beautiful pair of eyes? They were the color of green water. They made a man imagine that her eyes saw things no one else did.</p><p>\u201cDid you really stop writing poetry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied, the first word she\u2019d uttered since they began kissing. Her husky voice ignited his body and he took her mouth again, silently commanding her to ask for him. To ask for his services. To demand that he service her . . .</p><p>However she wanted to put it.</p><p>He would do anything, especially when her fingers curled in his hair and she pressed close to him. He would throw her on the bed and devour her, and the hell with promises and contracts, four nights or three hundred nights. Three hundred and sixty nights might not be enough.</p><p>\u201cGod, I want you.\u201d The words jumped from his mouth, as brutal and simple a sentence as a dockworker might say to a streetwalker.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be better\u2014\u201d Mia said, with a gasp, stopping because he took her mouth before she could finish. Her sentence wasn\u2019t going in the right direction.</p> <p>Without allowing her to speak, he pivoted, walked to his bed, and laid her there, his heavy body following hers.</p><p>It occurred to him that for the first time, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure that he could wait for a woman\u2019s permission. Shocked, he reared back and rolled to the side.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d he murmured, putting a finger on her plump lips. Should he demand a night? Hell, she was his wife. She was\u2014</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered, pink coming up in her cheeks. \u201cIf you . . . if you really want to.\u201d</p><p>Vander stared at her with incredulity. \u201c\u2018If I really want to?\u2019\u201d His cock was against her leg, so he rolled forward slightly. \u201cDoes that feel as if I\u2019m of two minds on the issue?\u201d</p><p>Mia blinked and looked down at his breeches. They were strained over an erection so ferocious that his smalls had given up the fight and slipped down. Which was damned uncomfortable, by the way.</p><p>There was one question he should ask, though he already knew the answer. Mia\u2019s response to him spoke for itself. She had surely slept with that imbecile of a fianc\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been with a man?\u201d he asked, schooling his tone to be neutral.</p><p>He knew instantly that he\u2019d made a mistake. \u201cI haven\u2019t had that opportunity,\u201d she replied, her voice stilted. Before he could stop her, she sat up and slid toward the edge of the bed. \u201cThis has been remarkably educational, Your Grace, but I think we shouldn\u2019t . . . shouldn\u2019t overtax our ability to spend time in the same room.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and caught her waist just as she got to her feet. \u201cStay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to ask that question.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and looked at him. \u201cWhy? Because I am a blackmailer, you think I am generous with my favors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It had nothing to do with that. A man treats a woman differently if she has experience, that\u2019s all. Many a couple anticipates their vows.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cEdward and I did not,\u201d she stated.</p><p>The feeling sweeping Vander\u2019s chest was primitive and uncivilized . . . powerful. \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d he said, before he could catch the words.</p><p>\u201cIf you will forgive me, Your Grace, I\u2019d like to retire to my chamber. I think that clearer minds should prevail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He tightened his fingers, holding her in place. \u201cWe must talk, Mia. We can\u2019t keep snapping things at each other. We\u2019re married now. We share responsibility for Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no responsibility for Charlie,\u201d she said instantly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are few people who could meet Charlie and not be both charmed by him and happy to take responsibility for him. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth wobbled. \u201cYou think so? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the same, you\u2019ve been coddling him. He needs to leave the house, get on a horse, figure out how to carry himself around other boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how cruel children can be. It might break his spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do have an idea, and it won\u2019t break him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know? Once, when he was five, I left him alone for just a few minutes in the village and when I returned, they had him in tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be more tears,\u201d Vander said calmly. \u201cThere will be difficult moments. But if we are at his shoulder, he\u2019ll be fine. He must do it, Mia. He has to grow up to be a man, not an invalid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was grinding her teeth, which made him grin. Marriage to Mia would never be boring.</p><p>He settled his arm more firmly around her waist, drawing her closer. \u201cI want to change the terms of our arrangement. Of our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no reason for that,\u201d she replied, not looking at him, but somewhere around his right ear. \u201cFour nights a year is more than enough to produce an heir. If four nights prove insufficient for that purpose, we might reconsider after a year has passed.\u201d She tried to leave, but he reeled her back against his chest as easily as a dappled trout caught in summertime.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he said again, his voice dark with lust. He nipped her ear. She jerked, but she didn\u2019t struggle free, and he felt her pulse quickening against his arm.</p> <p>\u201cSo let me tell you how this shall be,\u201d he said, when she remained silent. \u201cWe shall consummate our marriage tonight, because that\u2019s what newly married couples do. They go to bed together and they don\u2019t stand upright again for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do not have a normal marriage,\u201d she tried.</p><p>Her voice was tight, which Vander didn\u2019t like. \u201cTurn your head so I can kiss you,\u201d he said against her sweet-smelling hair.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis is inadvisable.\u201d His wife was stubborn. Hell, if he looked up the word in a dictionary, he\u2019d probably find the name Mia printed there. \u201cWe\u2019re not really married,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are. You\u2019re my wife, and you\u2019re staying my wife. And if you think we\u2019re not going to sleep together, after you kissed me like that, you are wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKissed you . . .\u201d She cleared her throat and turned her head just enough to frown at him. \u201cYou kissed me, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>Desire boiled in his gut, urging him to topple her backward again. But he\u2019d already pushed his wife enough. If he pressed open those strawberry lips, he could seduce her.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t enough. He suspected that bedding Mia would be like learning the art of making love all over again.</p><p>You can\u2019t do that alone.</p> <p>\u201cThat kiss was a long, slow ride into oblivion, and it took two of us,\u201d he whispered, his lips brushing her cheek. \u201cYou opened that sweet little mouth of yours, and tangled tongues with me as if you wanted me just as much as I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>NOTES ON CHURCH &amp; JILTING</p><p>~ Shocked gasps from the assembled audience. guests in the cathedral.

Her husband had hardly glanced at her, and the walls she\u2019d built up to hide her love had cracked open. \u201cI did not kiss you,\u201d she said stoutly.</p><p>The laughter in Vander\u2019s eyes made her at once irritated and aroused.</p><p>\u201cThe man whom you kiss would forget he\u2019s ever been kissed by another woman,\u201d he said, cupping her face in his hands and tilting her head until he had her just where he wanted her.</p><p>This was dangerous. All Mia\u2019s childhood yearnings flooded back into her heart as if they had never left. As if Vander was the only man she had ever loved or desired.</p><p>He bent his head again, at the same time one of his hands slid down over her collarbone.</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said innocently.</p><p>\u201cYou are touching my\u2014\u201d she faltered, then cleared her throat. If they were to consummate the marriage\u2014and she wasn\u2019t foolish enough to delude herself about that\u2014some basic rules of conduct had to be established.</p><p>She might be destroyed by her marriage, broken into shards. But at least she could avoid the sort of humiliation that had scarred her after her poetry\u2014and her chest\u2014had been mocked.</p><p>He could have her body. But not that part. Not the part she abhorred. \u201cYou may not touch me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer not to be touched there,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>His voice came out fast and low. \u201cDid someone grope you against your will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mia cried, startled. \u201cNo one has ever\u2014and no one shall, and that includes you.\u201d</p><p>His face relaxed, but his eyes had lost the heated sweetness they had before. She regretted it, but it was essential that she made herself understood. She\u2019d gathered from other women that men liked to feel women\u2019s breasts.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She tried to explain. \u201cWe all have parts of our body that we are less than happy with.\u201d</p><p>An eyebrow shot up. \u201cWe have?\u201d</p><p>Men, it seemed, liked everything about themselves. That didn\u2019t surprise her in the least. \u201cWomen have, at any rate. Some women don\u2019t like their knees, or their feet, or their hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour bosom is exquisite. And your hair. I can\u2019t speak of your knees or feet, but if given the chance, I can reassure you on those points as well.\u201d</p><p>Mia could hardly believe that Evander Septimus Brody, the most handsome duke in all England, was gazing at plain Emilia Carrington with desire in his eyes.</p><p>But he was.</p><p>Lust, even. Lust for someone like her? A quiet voice reminded her that men were like tomcats; they lusted indiscriminately.</p><p>But another part of her thought that his eyes had changed color since kissing her. That was for her.</p><p>Not for just any woman.</p><p>For her.</p><p>\u201cMia?\u201d He leaned forward and kissed her, swift and hard. \u201cCan we agree about your hair and move to points farther south?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was like my father\u2019s. Actually, you referred to him as my \u2018blasted father,\u2019\u201d she clarified.</p><p>Vander brought a handful of her hair forward, his strong brown fingers entangled in it. \u201cI will never be fond of your father. But . . . Chuffy revealed a few things tonight that I\u2014at any rate, I must give it some thought. Your hair is like sunshine. And your breasts are truly stupendous.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to talk about them.\u201d Back when Oakenrott had labeled them cabbages, they had been large for her age, but now they were larger still. Stupendous was one word for them.</p><p>But he persisted, asking again, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t. I think we should wait,\u201d she said, babbling a bit. \u201cA bride should . . . A bride should look entirely different when . . . when intimacies . . .\u201d Her voice died away because Vander\u2019s lips were sliding across her cheek, coming ever closer to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said, \u201ctell me more about what you think should happen.\u201d Rather than wait for a reply, though, he kissed her again. His kiss was rough and sweet, and his urgency made her melt against him helplessly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sometime later she opened her eyes. They were lying down again, and Vander\u2019s hands were sliding up her legs. His eyes were on hers, waiting to see if she approved. \u201cYou make me so fucking hungry,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Mia had overheard that word shouted by street sweepers and once, memorably, growled by her father, but no one had ever said it to her. \u201cDid you say that word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you can\u2019t say things like that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re a duke and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my duchess.\u201d His hand went higher, skimming over her thigh. She shivered under his touch. Her legs fell open because that part of her was burning.</p><p>He made a groaning noise. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a duke, Mia. You should know that by now. My mother was known as a whore the length and breadth of England by the time I got to Eton. I had to fight my way through school. My only friend was a bastard.\u201d</p><p>Mia froze, horrified. \u201cThe boys spoke to you about your mother\u2019s behavior?\u201d</p><p>He grinned as if she had asked the silliest question imaginable. \u201cThey generally didn\u2019t speak; they just called me names. And I answered them with my fists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOakenrott,\u201d she said with disgust. \u201cThat loathsome little toad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d He stopped. \u201cI forgot that you know precisely what Rotter is like.\u201d</p><p>His hand had reached the roundest part of Mia\u2019s thighs and she was fighting an impulse to moan. Anything that would encourage him to move his hand higher, to the place between her legs that was waiting for his touch.</p><p>He smiled as if he knew what she was thinking, and his fingers slid right between her legs. Mia squeezed her eyes shut and concentrated on the aching darkness behind her eyelids, and the fact that her hands clutched arms hard with muscles.</p><p>She wondered for a second if this touch was permissible between a lady and gentleman, and pushed the thought away. She had no one to ask. And she didn\u2019t want him to stop.</p><p>In fact, she thought of allowing her legs to fall open and pulling his large body on top of her. That image was so shocking that she stayed absolutely still, not moving a muscle.</p><p>\u201cI love touching you, Mia,\u201d Vander growled, his voice low, guttural but sweet. \u201cI intend to kiss you there too.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open. \u201cNo, you will not!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and his fingers swirled and pressed. Mia\u2019s head fell back again and she let out a sound that no lady would allow to pass her lips.</p><p>Vander rolled on top of her, all his delicious weight holding her down. He began kissing her so fiercely that his hunger soaked into her body, taking all her restraints, taking away her claim to be a lady.</p><p>Before she knew it, she was shuddering all over, her hands clenched tight around his forearms, begging without words.</p><p>And then begging with words, because she was bursting into flames and he was the only person who could help her.</p><p>But he stopped. Why had he stopped? She whimpered, looking at him through eyes dazed with desire. She was wound tighter than a spool of wire, vibrating like a note so high that it barely struck the ear. \u201cMia,\u201d he growled, \u201cask me for one of your four nights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWh\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>His hand took up that rough caress again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIs this to be one of your four nights?\u201d</p><p>Something unraveled in her heart, destroying the last of her defenses, the final shard of sanity she possessed. \u201cYes! It is, it is.\u201d</p><p>What he said in response . . . what he did . . . was blasphemous. Miraculous. She felt like a river, liquid, rushing to a destination outside her control. She clung to him, crying out, her body clenching around his probing fingers as his thumb dragged over her soft flesh, setting it on fire.</p><p>The only thing that mattered was the stark lust that shimmered in the air around both of them. Vander was driving her to a pleasure greater than she could have imagined.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t quite got there when he bundled her skirts around her waist and, as if he were her maid preparing her for bed, began swiftly undressing her. As she would to her maid, Mia mindlessly obeyed his requests, her breath coming in little pants, her brain muddled by desire. Raise your arms, Turn on your side, Twist the other way.</p><p>Her corset was tossed to the floor. It was only when he tried to remove her chemise that she came back to herself and clamped her arms across her chest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019d used the word thousands of times, but never under these circumstances. It came out with a kind of sultry intimacy that she\u2019d never heard from her own lips. Or anyone else\u2019s, either.</p><p>In response, Vander stood and pulled his shirt over his head. She pushed up on her elbows, openly staring. When she was a girl, she used to sit on the fence and watch him working with horses, surreptitiously feasting her eyes on his chest. He hadn\u2019t even been fifteen years old.</p><p>It was all different now.</p><p>What had been a youth\u2019s sinewy leanness had filled out into a grown-up male beauty that made her tremble. His face was set in ferocious lines of need and his eyes roamed over her body without the slightest distaste. He bent down and pulled off his breeches, standing squarely before her, flaunting himself.</p><p>Her eyes widened. This was entirely different than seeing him in his smalls, when she proposed marriage.</p><p>Vander grinned at her with a purely male pride. \u201cIs it the first time you\u2019ve seen a man in the flesh?\u201d he purred. He came down on all fours over her. This was truly happening.</p><p>Vander was about to make love to her.</p><p>She had the vague sense that she was expected to exhibit virginal apprehension, but she felt none. She wanted to touch him all over, wind his thick hair around her fingers, pull his mouth down to hers.</p><p>Of course she couldn\u2019t behave like that. She had to rein in this unfamiliar wantonness. So she reached up to him, but in a ladylike way, putting her hands delicately, loosely around his neck, sliding them to his shoulders with the hope that caress was appropriate. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we douse the lamp?\u201d</p><p>Warm muscles slid beneath her fingers as he shrugged. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because darkness was more modest, she thought. But what part did modesty play in bedding, when a man put his fingers in such private places, and teased those pleading sounds from a woman\u2019s mouth?</p><p>Who could be modest after that?</p><p>It was too late.</p><p>Mia abruptly decided to abandon her plans for ladylike restraint. She surrendered to curiosity and slid her hand down his chest to reach the part of him that strained toward her.</p><p>He stifled a groan as she ran a finger down his length and, with a quick glance at him for approval, curved her hand around him. He was thick, hot and silky.</p><p>A curse, dark and guttural, wrenched from his throat. Likely every man thought he possessed the largest tool a woman had ever seen. And because society demanded that a lady never admit to intimacies of any sort, these delusions of grandeur were never dispelled.</p><p>Still, she could hardly imagine anyone larger than Vander. It would be impossible. It was impossible now.</p><p>The thought brought a chill down her spine and she felt a pang of fear. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d she asked, bringing her hands back to his shoulders. She was on her back, legs together, and he had a knee on either side of her hips.</p><p>The whole situation was embarrassing, and the lovely warmth she had in her stomach began to drain away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs the rule about not touching your breasts still in place?\u201d</p><p>Mia withdrew her arms from around his neck and crossed them over her breasts. Maybe she would start to wear her corset under her chemise to hold them in a bit. Glancing down showed that her breasts looked even larger from this perspective. She felt a lurch of disgust in her stomach.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI\u2019ve never made love to a woman wearing clothing before.\u201d</p><p>Her turn to raise an eyebrow. \u201cReally? I thought that gentlemen were always taking women into back alleys and tupping them against the wall?\u201d She meant her tone to be sardonic, but somehow it came out a little intrigued.</p> <p>\u201cI have not had that particular pleasure,\u201d he said, after a telling moment of silence. \u201cBut I\u2019d be delighted to experiment, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she spluttered.</p><p>He lowered his head and his lips drifted across hers. \u201cFair warning: in lieu of a back alley, I propose to make you scream my name. I\u2019m tired of being Your Grace\u2019d.\u201d</p><p>Mia felt another chilly bolt of panic as Vander pulled her legs apart. He lowered his head, and dropped a kiss on her inner thigh. \u201cThat\u2019s inappropriate!\u201d she whispered urgently.</p><p>He lifted his head, eyes devilish. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . .\u201d His lips caressed skin, closer to the heart of her.</p><p>This was too intimate. It was one thing if he put that part of himself inside her. She could turn her head, or\u2014or something. But she had a terrible feeling that if he kissed her there, she would lose what remained of her self-control.</p><p>It would be worse than when he touched her. She wouldn\u2019t be herself; she would be turned inside out by desire, ravished, begging him . . .</p><p>She was not wrong.</p><p>Without warning, he lapped at her and she screamed. His mouth was wet and ravenous, and set Mia on fire like a spark landing on a pile of dry kindling.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think. She could do nothing but twine her fingers in his hair. Even his warm breath against her flesh made her shudder. She let go of Vander\u2019s hair because her fingers curled, and her toes curled. Everything in her was tightening, launching her like a boat to some distant shore.</p> <p>And then it was happening; she slammed out into deep water, sensation rushing over her. Vander was urging her on, his voice smoky. She heard him dimly, realizing only later what he was saying.</p><p>And she . . . that wave brought her back to where she\u2019d been years ago: in love. In love with Evander Septimus Brody.</p><p>So mad with love that she had written him a poem, had dreamt of him entering her moonlit room.</p><p>He was rising over her, pushing her legs further apart, whispering something . . . an apology? Pushing into her.</p><p>It was a possession her body welcomed, even though it was uncomfortable. Perhaps more than uncomfortable. Abruptly her mind slammed back into clarity and she stopped him with both hands to his chest. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Alarm had replaced every other emotion. Something was wrong. He was too large, like a cork that didn\u2019t fit a bottle.</p><p>His words were strangled. \u201cDuchess, you can\u2019t stop me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit,\u201d she said, choosing her words carefully. \u201cWe are not compatible. You\u2019ll have to\u2014\u201d She shoved at his shoulders. \u201cTake yourself off. It\u2019s not working.\u201d</p> <p>He took a breath, didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Mia felt a primitive surge of fear: \u201cGet off me,\u201d she cried. \u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? It doesn\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>To her utter fury, a flash of amusement went through his eyes. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d he asked silkily. \u201cBecause it feels damned perfect to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t swear!\u201d she cried, beside herself. Then she realized what he was doing, rocking slightly as he spoke, slipping in further. And further. \u201cStop that,\u201d she said, between clenched teeth.</p><p>He was braced on his arms, over her. She smelled something heady: a man\u2019s sweat, combined with an elusive touch of leather and fresh air. Vander\u2019s eyes were intense blue slits, and she grasped that he was exerting tremendous self-control not to push forward.</p><p>Mia cleared her throat. \u201cLet\u2019s try again at a later date,\u201d she suggested. Such as never, her mind supplied.</p><p>He nudged forward again. \u201cIs it painful?\u201d he asked, his eyes intent on hers.</p><p>It felt intrusive. Too much. Too wide. Too fast. \u201cIt isn\u2019t painful, exactly, but it\u2019s just not right. We\u2019re not compatible. You\u2019re too large and too close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I move a bit more?\u201d he whispered back. \u201cYou\u2019re driving me mad, Mia. I\u2019ve never felt anything like it.\u201d He nudged forward again and as she watched, his pupils dilated and his head dipped so that strands of hair brushed her face.</p><p>Just like that all the heat bubbled up in her again. And just like that, he no longer seemed intrusive and too large, but like a part of her body that had been missing until now. He was both foreign and intrinsic to her.</p><p>Tentatively, she tilted her hips, and though he hadn\u2019t moved, the thick length of him came into her a bit more. Breath came harshly between his lips. \u201cYou,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, Mia.\u201d</p><p>A dark undertow of desire pulled her down, teasing her, taunting. She braced her knees, and slowly, slowly pressed upward. Her body shook, but it had nothing to do with pain.</p><p>Her body and his . . .</p><p>They were two halves of the same whole.</p><p>Vander made that inarticulate noise again, and she caught sight of his face: beautiful, voracious, raw. It fired her blood, dragged her under. With a wild cry, she pushed up, pulling him down at the same moment, seating him fully in the softness of her body.</p><p>His response was carnal, as his body surged into motion. Mia gasped, trying to learn the rhythm of the dance, an urgent, hard, pounding dance. She barely mastered it and she was shooting down that same river again, clinging to him, arms around his neck, legs curving around his hips, head back, being pulled faster and faster . . .</p><p>She finally let go with a scream, surrendering to the deep pleasure that washed over her, her fingernails digging into the thick muscles of his shoulders.</p><p>Dimly, she heard a harsh noise come from his lips and he pumped again, once, twice more, pressed into her so far that there was no place where he stopped and she started.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>From Miss Lucibella Delicosa to Mrs. Petunia Stubbs</p><p>September 11, 1800</p><p>Dear Mrs. Stubbs,</p><p>I write in response to your letter of June 17, informing me that you plan to name your unborn daughter\u2014if she is a daughter\u2014after one of my heroines. I am truly honored to think that you have read Esmeralda, or Memoirs of an Heiress over twenty times. And I am deeply moved to know that my books helped you overcome the tragedy of your mother\u2019s death.</p><p>I generally hesitate to offer advice, but since you express the fervent wish that your future daughter resemble my heroine in every particular, I do want to point out that Esmeralda\u2019s appearance might lead one to think that the hero loves her for that reason. It is not so: he loves Esmeralda for her loving spirit, kind heart, and courageous disposition.</p><p>It is my hope that your daughter will have those attributes of Esmeralda, as they will give her a much happier life than if she resembles my heroine\u2019s appearance.</p><p>I wish you and Esmeralda all the best in life,</p><p>Miss Lucibella Delicosa</p><p>Mia woke suddenly, the way she used to jerk awake when Charlie was a baby and she heard a wail from the nursery. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vander lay on his back, his face turned away from her, the sheet barely covering his hips. Dawn was creeping into the room, just enough that it clung to the contours of his body, as if the glow originated within him. Bands of muscle marched across his belly in perfect order.</p><p>If she dared, she would have traced each band with her fingers, investigating how they knit to his back and shoulders, linking to burly arms stained brown by the sun.</p><p>His body was the opposite of hers. There wasn\u2019t a bit of fat on him; his body was like stored motion, shaped to conquer men and pleasure women. Her fingers itched to caress him, feel all that untamed strength under her hands . . . lying still at her command. She imagined him quivering as she drove him to make the unguarded, rough sound that had come from his throat the night before.</p><p>She snatched her hand back just in time. She had already made a fool of herself. It would be different if they were better matched.</p> <p>The dissimilarities between them couldn\u2019t be more obvious. It was unnecessary to glance down: Her knees were plump and her thighs were plumper. There must be muscle somewhere in her legs, because she managed to stand and sit and walk, but they certainly weren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Thank goodness, he hadn\u2019t argued with her about her chemise, though it didn\u2019t hide very much in the growing light of morning. She could see her nipples and the curve of her belly through the cloth.</p><p>Lower, where her chemise was still hitched up around her hips, she saw rusty stains on her leg. And on the sheets, she saw with some dismay. Susan\u2014and the rest of the household\u2014would have no doubts about what had happened the night before.</p><p>She wiggled backward cautiously, reaching her toe down to touch the floor, eyes on Vander. He breathed slowly, his arms flung out, as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world. He slept like a man who owned the world, a duke whom everyone desired. It was another dissimilarity between them: she always slept in a ball, tightly coiled.</p><p>Once in the bathing room, and with the door to Vander\u2019s bedchamber firmly latched, she stared at herself in all those mirrors. Last night he had spread her out like a feast and done things to her with his mouth and hands . . . things that made her whimper and cry and generally act like a fool.</p> <p>The four nights rule was a good one. She knew instinctively that it would hurt to do this more than once every few months. Oh, not hurt in a physical sense, but in her heart.</p><p>Making love could too easily become a habit, like some sort of honey dream leading her to believe that her husband adored her, the way Frederic adored Flora in the novel she was writing.</p><p>Except Vander was nothing whatsoever like Frederic. She was probably lucky that he remembered her name in the midst of passion. In fact, now she thought of it, Vander might not remember her name, since he always called her \u201cDuchess.\u201d</p><p>Whereas for her . . . she stared blankly at herself, acknowledging the truth of it. She was fifty times more in love with him now than she had been as a young girl. Even thinking about him made her heart flutter in her chest.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t protect that heart, it would crack into a hundred pieces when he lost interest. Last night was like playing a game, the best game ever invented. She had to keep in mind that it was only a game, and one at which Vander excelled.</p><p>At least the four nights were at her discretion. As her husband, he could have demanded marital intimacies whenever he wanted, even if he came straight from another woman\u2019s bed. The thought made her feel ill.</p> <p>For a moment, a gaping emptiness opened up before her, the conviction that she wouldn\u2019t survive this marriage. Men craved variety; she knew that even with her limited understanding of society and its relations. How could she join him in bed, once she knew that he had turned to another woman?</p><p>Ruthlessness took over.</p><p>She could. She would.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the first woman to have fallen in love with a beautiful man. Besides, everything might change in a few months. Vander might wake up and realize that he wanted a wife like the one his friend Thorn had: a perfect, exquisite noblewoman.</p><p>They would divorce . . . unless she was with child.</p><p>For a moment she lapsed into fear, her mind scurrying in circles. But her brother, John, had been married to Pansy for years, and they had but one child. Vander was an only child.</p><p>She had a vague understanding that it took repeated attempts over a long time.</p><p>The four nights rule would save her from that.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>NOTES ON FLORA\u2019S EXILE</p><p>~ Flora believes Frederic jilted her, made her forfeit the inheritance, from pure malice. (That\u2019s good!)</p><p>~ Having spent her last 2d. on a crust of bread, she wanders along the lanes of England, tattered, cold, hungry. Near death? Yes.

Maybe not.</p><p>~ Ruffian. Rake. Rou\u00e9.</p><p>~ Scoundrel?</p><p>~ \u201cHe whom she had long worshipped had proved himself naught but a Worthless Idol.

Just look at this.\u201d He looked down at the dog at his feet and commanded, \u201cRoll, Dobbie, roll!\u201d</p><p>Dobbie sat down and looked up at him, panting with willingness.</p><p>Mia waited, but nothing happened. \u201cYou\u2019ll get it, old fellow,\u201d Charlie reassured the dog, dropping the bread into his open mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow did Dobbie and Winky sleep last night?\u201d Mia inquired.</p><p>\u201cThey love being with me,\u201d Charlie boasted. \u201cThey used to be the duke\u2019s mother\u2019s dogs, and His Grace says they\u2019ve been lonely. I let them both sleep on the bed with me, and they weren\u2019t lonely at all.\u201d</p><p>And neither was Charlie, apparently.</p><p>Mia went over and dropped a kiss on the top of his head. She remembered the duchess\u2019 exquisitely groomed and scented dogs, always tricked out in bright ribbons. A year after her death, the animals were considerably shaggier, with no ribbons in sight.</p><p>Winky trotted over to her so she crouched down and scratched his ears. He had thin legs, like the brown cigars that the grooms smoked when they weren\u2019t on duty. Age had brought touches of white here and there, but his eyes were still bright and cheerful.</p><p>\u201cDo sit down, sweetheart,\u201d she said to Charlie. \u201cYou might fall, especially if Dobbie starts pawing your legs again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay on my feet as much as possible. It will make me stronger. The duke says so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia sat down and Winky hopped up, curling into a ball in her lap.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ll sit down now,\u201d Charlie allowed.</p><p>She patted the sofa beside her and he picked up Dobbie and made his way around and sat.</p><p>\u201cMr. Gaunt thinks it best that they be kept out of the drawing room, but they can go everywhere else with me. Just think: that old butler made them sleep in the garden shed the whole last year,\u201d Charlie said, stroking Dobbie\u2019s ears.</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t very nice,\u201d Mia agreed. \u201cI gather you rescued them from the potato cellar.\u201d</p><p>Charlie nodded. \u201cThe duke and I went to the kitchens night before last, because that\u2019s what we always do. We fetched something to eat, because I\u2019m growing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you always do?\u201d Mia echoed. \u201cYou\u2019ve known His Grace for only two days, Charlie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps not every day. But we did it at home, in Carrington House, and last night too.\u201d He paused. \u201cI suppose this is our home now, Aunt Mia?\u201d</p><p>Mia cleared her throat. \u201cFor now,\u201d she said weakly.</p> <p>\u201cThe duke said Dobbie and Winky look like hairy eggs.\u201d He held Dobbie up by his front paws and leaned forward to rub noses. \u201cYou\u2019re not a hairy egg, are you, old fellow?\u201d Dobbie obligingly licked him, giving a little bark.</p><p>\u201cTry not to let him lick your mouth,\u201d Mia said. She pulled her feet up beneath her and shifted Winky to the crook of her left arm. \u201cThese dogs are smaller than you were when you were born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Charlie was trying to avoid Dobbie\u2019s enthusiastic licks and giggling madly.</p><p>\u201cYou had a plump tummy. The duke is right: if Winky didn\u2019t have all this fur, he wouldn\u2019t be much bigger than an egg. Of course, it would have to be a large egg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps an ostrich egg,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cI have just been reading about them. An ostrich is an enormous bird that can\u2019t fly. It has the biggest eggs of any bird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does one find an ostrich?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. Not in Berkshire. Was my mother there when I was born?\u201d</p><p>Mia opened her mouth and shut it again. Was Charlie still at the age where babies were found under cabbage leaves?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to see how I can make Dobbie dance?\u201d Charlie said, already having forgotten his question. \u201cLook at this!\u201d</p><p>Winky had gone to sleep, so Mia stopped stroking him. \u201cI think I\u2019ll pay a brief visit to the stables, Charlie. Perhaps you should work on your essay for the vicar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to come to the stables with you,\u201d Charlie said, dropping Dobbie\u2019s legs. \u201cI want to see the wild Arabian horse who loves only you. Mary\u2014she\u2019s the maid assigned to the nursery\u2014told me all about him. His name means storm, or something like that. I shall ride him. Someday.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s head spun. Charlie was thinking of riding Jafeer? Not while she had breath in her body.</p><p>He hopped up and put his crutch under his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go! Winky and Dobbie can come as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinky is having a nap,\u201d Mia said, moving the little curl of dog onto the sofa cushion as she rose.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s older,\u201d Charlie reported. \u201cWinky could be a grandfather. The duke says his mother bought Dobbie to be Winky\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you three wait here, and I\u2019ll ask a footman to carry you downstairs,\u201d Mia suggested.</p><p>\u201cI can get down the stairs myself,\u201d Charlie said, marching to the door and pulling it open. \u201cCome on, Aunt Mia!\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s heart sank. He would hang onto the railing and make his way down backward, a step at a time, and agonizingly slowly; it could take an hour to reach the bottom. She was longing for a cup of tea and breakfast. \u201cHave you eaten?\u201d she asked Charlie.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said, clumping his way along the corridor.</p><p>The stairs curved in a gracious semicircle. \u201cAre you certain you don\u2019t want me to fetch a footman, Charlie? It would be the work of a moment for one of those young men to carry you down.\u201d</p><p>Charlie shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m too old for that. His Grace said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis Grace said so?\u201d What hadn\u2019t His Grace said?</p><p>\u201cYou may wait for me at the bottom,\u201d Charlie ordered, sounding for all the world like a duke himself.</p><p>He was growing up. That was natural, Mia told herself. Charlie issued another order. \u201cDobbie, you go with Aunt Mia.\u201d The dog frisked around Charlie\u2019s feet, paying no attention.</p><p>Mia picked up Dobbie and started down the stairs with a sigh. She would have to discuss this with Vander. He was treating Charlie with cavalier indifference, as if her nephew were a typical boy.</p><p>As she neared the stairs\u2019 midpoint, where the steps curved, Mia looked back to check on Charlie\u2019s progress and discovered he was still at the top, waving to a footman in the entry below.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Roberts,\u201d Charlie shouted. \u201cHurry up, Aunt Mia, or I shall beat you!\u201d</p><p>Before Mia could respond, he tucked his crutch under an arm, threw a leg over the railing, and whizzed past her.</p><p>Mia let out a shriek and dropped Dobbie. Mercifully, the animal landed on his feet, barking madly, and bounced down the stairs, ears flapping. For her part, Mia stopped breathing, heart pounding, until she saw Roberts deftly catch Charlie.</p><p>She sagged down onto a step, her hand pressed to her heart. Below, Charlie was hopping around the black-and-white marble floor as if he hadn\u2019t been close to bashing his head. Or losing his life.</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t worry,\u201d a deep voice said behind her.</p><p>Mia looked up, her throat too tight to speak. Vander put a hand under her arm, and helped her to her feet. \u201cChildren always hang on tighter than their parents believe they will. Shall we join him?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t respond. She had to have a stern talk with Charlie. From this moment on, he was not allowed to touch the banister. If he did that again, she\u2019d do something . . . something serious. Lock him in the nursery.</p><p>Even as the idea came to her, she recoiled from it. Charlie spent too much time indoors already; his skin was porcelain white.</p><p>She realized that Vander still held her arm. Shuddering alarm was replaced by a sense of warmth radiating from his touch. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said hoarsely. \u201cI was terrified by that . . . by Charlie, and I didn\u2019t hear what you just said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely said that your nephew is a brave fellow. I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re proud of him.\u201d</p><p>They reached the bottom of the stairs. Charlie had already made his way through the front door that Gaunt held open, and was waiting for them at the top of three stone steps leading to the drive.</p><p>He turned, gave them an impish grin, and shouted, \u201cLook at me!\u201d Then, before she could take a breath, he dropped his crutch and jumped.</p><p>She screamed again, freezing in place. When Charlie landed, his right foot couldn\u2019t hold his weight and he collapsed, plunging forward and hitting his face on the cobblestones.</p><p>\u201cOh dear God,\u201d Mia cried, and ran down the steps toward him. Vander preceded her, and was already crouching over Charlie and gently turning him over. A bloody scrape discolored Charlie\u2019s brow and his eyes were closed.</p><p>Mia felt a dagger of fear when his eyes didn\u2019t instantly open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCharlie,\u201d Vander said. \u201cYou\u2019re frightening your aunt. Open your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Mia sank to her knees. \u201cDarling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat hurt,\u201d Charlie said, his eyelids flying open.</p><p>Her heart began beating again. That was the voice her child used when he bruised something, stubbed his toe, sprained a wrist breaking his fall. He had been falling since he could stand\u2014but she\u2019d never once seen him do anything deliberately dangerous the way he had today.</p> <p>Twice today.</p><p>The timbre of Vander\u2019s voice was dark and commanding. \u201cLook at me, Charles Wallace.\u201d</p><p>Charlie turned his head and looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThat was exceedingly foolish. You had no way of knowing whether your leg would be able to support you, and it was possible that you could concuss yourself on the stones, or stab yourself with your crutch. And to try such a thing while your aunt watched showed callous disregard for her. I am disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have made any difference if I hadn\u2019t seen it,\u201d Mia said, her voice wavering. \u201cYou must promise never to do something so dangerous ever again, Charlie. Never!\u201d</p> <p>Charlie sat up, rubbing his weak leg. \u201cI won\u2019t get strong if I don\u2019t test myself.\u201d He sounded sulky.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Vander said, \u201cbut you must go about it intelligently. Your leg has to be strong enough to bear your weight first. Remember when you told me that if you bowed, you would topple?\u201d</p><p>Charlie nodded, his bottom lip jutting out in a way that made a pang of pure love go through Mia. When he was two years old, he had that expression almost every day, every hour, as he fought to walk. The doctors said he would never manage it, but they had been wrong.</p><p>\u201cYou knew how to fall and roll. That\u2019s how confident you have to be before you take a risk of any kind.\u201d He hoisted Charlie to his feet. \u201cDo you think you can walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Charlie said stoutly, leaning against Vander.</p><p>Mia blotted the scrape on his forehead with a handkerchief. Then she scooped up Charlie\u2019s crutch and handed it to him.</p> <p>Tears were pressing on the back of her throat, and she longed to give him a tight hug, but instinct told her to keep silent. Charlie needed advice from a grown male, and no one was more male than Vander. The duke crouched again and ran his hand along Charlie\u2019s leg.</p><p>Mia straightened and turned away. Seeing Vander lean intently toward Charlie, without the faintest sign that he considered her nephew lame or deformed in some way . . . This was as dangerous to her heart as making love.</p><p>In fact, it tore at her defenses as nothing else could have. She decided to return to the house.</p><p>A large hand curled around her wrist. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>Charlie plunked his crutch in place and leaned on it, testing his leg. \u201cYou said we\u2019re going to the stables, Aunt Mia. You mustn\u2019t go inside now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou frightened me,\u201d Mia said, the words coming out against her will.</p><p>Vander said quietly, \u201cApologize, Charlie. You are lucky to have someone who loves you as much as your aunt does. One of a man\u2019s duties in life is to try not to frighten the people who love him.\u201d</p><p>Charlie thought about it for a moment, before he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Aunt Mia.\u201d He dropped his crutch, took a hop, and wound his arms around her waist.</p> <p>A tear rolled down Mia\u2019s cheek. She met Vander\u2019s eyes over his head and smiled shakily.</p><p>\u201cHello, hello!\u201d Chuffy charged out of the front door and down the steps. This morning he was wearing a black coat with a waistcoat of gaudy purple visible beneath. He carried a purple stick with a large stone in the top, and he was swinging it like a man without a care.</p><p>Or a headache from imbibing a vat of brandy, which, frankly, Mia thought was miraculous.</p><p>\u201cThis must be Master Charlie!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>Charlie pulled back from Mia and stared, awestruck.</p><p>\u201cJust look at that,\u201d Chuffy exclaimed. \u201cWe\u2019re both in need of an extra leg.\u201d He waved his elegant stick.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a crutch,\u201d Charlie pointed out loftily.</p><p>Chuffy spun it in the air. \u201cNo, because I can do this with it. Can you do that with yours?\u201d He spun it again.</p><p>Charlie laughed, a boy\u2019s high laugh. Clinging to Mia\u2019s sleeve with one hand, he retrieved his crutch, and tried to twirl it. To no one\u2019s surprise, it clattered to the ground.</p><p>A minute later, Chuffy had Charlie in fits of laughter, promising to teach him how to spin his crutch on the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThe boys at school will love it,\u201d Chuffy said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to get you a crutch with proper balance, of course. Not to worry; I know all the cane-makers in London. You\u2019ve found your way into the right family, son!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go to the stables?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>\u201cPay no attention to him,\u201d Chuffy said, winking at Charlie. \u201cHe\u2019s my nevvy, but people have given him entirely too much attention since he became a duke. Poisoned his brain. So do you think you can beat me to the stables? They\u2019re right around the turn of the path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can!\u201d Charlie cried. \u201cYou have to let me start first, though, because I\u2019m younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I should get an advantage because I\u2019m fatter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Charlie said. \u201cI also deserve more time because I have a bad leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a bad body,\u201d Chuffy countered ruthlessly. \u201cI can\u2019t drink nearly as much as I used to be able to. No advantage on that front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then,\u201d Charlie said triumphantly. \u201cI\u2019m an orphan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I!\u201d Chuffy exclaimed, wagging his bushy eyebrows. \u201cOh go on, I\u2019ll give you a bit of a lead, purely from the kindness of my heart.\u201d</p><p>Charlie grinned and took off, swinging as fast as he could. Dobbie followed, barking madly.</p><p>\u201cA fine lad!\u201d Chuffy said, patting Mia\u2019s arm. He waited until Charlie was halfway up the path, and then took out after him.</p><p>\u201cDid I correctly understand that you were escorting your nephew to the stables in order to introduce him to Jafeer, the most violent horse I own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJafeer is not violent,\u201d Mia said, trying not to think about how much she wanted Vander to drop her arm and kiss her. Kiss her the way he had last night.</p><p>He glanced down at her, eyebrow raised. \u201cHe\u2019s not the first horse I\u2019d choose for Charlie to ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRide? Absolutely not! I must speak to you about that. I\u2019ve never even put Charlie on Lancelot. He could never ride a proper horse: perhaps a pony, a very small pony.\u201d She gestured to a level near her waist.</p><p>\u201cThere are no ponies that size; you\u2019re talking about a large dog.\u201d</p><p>She heard the amusement in his voice and frowned. \u201cIn that case he must learn to ride on Lancelot. I\u2019m entirely serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I. Charlie has to go to school, and I mean to ensure that he\u2019ll be the best rider at Eton by the time he gets there. We\u2019ll send a thoroughbred along with him, so all the boys can see his prowess.\u201d</p><p>Mia inhaled sharply. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing. Charlie can\u2019t go to school, certainly not boarding school!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he can.\u201d</p><p>Vander simply didn\u2019t understand. He hadn\u2019t watched as Charlie grew up, or seen how cruel other people\u2014including the boy\u2019s own mother\u2014had been to him. She glanced ahead and saw that Chuffy and Charlie had disappeared around the bend leading to the stables. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCharlie cannot\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>But she broke off when she met Vander\u2019s eyes. They were heavy-lidded, a devastating knowledge gleaming in their depths. A knowledge of her, of what they did the night before, of what she felt like, and tasted like, and sounded like.</p><p>The cool control in his eyes was gone, swallowed by an erotic abandon that she had scarcely learned, although her body responded instantly.</p><p>\u201cCharlie will enjoy Eton.\u201d He placed his hands on her arms and drew her to him. \u201cYou left my bedchamber without saying good morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were sleeping,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cNext time, wake me.\u201d His expression made her weak at the knees. \u201cAs I see it, this is still part of my night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first night.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p> <p>NOTES ON NEAR-DEATH SCENE</p><p>~ Flora lies dying amongst the poppies, her yellow hair &amp; etc. Trembling, pale, her tuneful voice reduced to a prayerful murmur. Has eaten naught but an egg in the last day. Raw? Ugh. Dove\u2019s egg? It\u2019s splattering rain, Angel\u2019s Tears.</p><p>~ Frederic has searched every lane throughout England. Too much to say that he would not long survive her death? Probably.</p><p>~ he gives up only a few paces from her form. White and lean, sorrow concealed, his easy graceful movements reduced to\u2014to something.</p><p>~ Sinks to his knees only a few steps from her prostrate form and prays that the Almighty will give him the Dearest Hope of his heart: his Flora. \u201cI was made bewildered and impatient by the strength of my feelings. Like a base Indian fool, I threw away a pearl worth more than all my tribe possessions.\u201d (Another touch of Shakespeare!)</p><p>~ \u201cIf you restore her to me, Lord, I will become a humble attendant to her daily Lesson of Love. No matter what affections Flora awakens in the breasts of her admirers, I will respect and honor her faithful love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Mia said, trying to ignore the coaxing honey in Vander\u2019s voice. She desperately tried to remember the important issues she had thought to discuss with him.</p><p>When her husband looked at her with that expression, all she wanted to do was answer his craving with a kiss. Hurl herself into his arms and pull his face down to hers.</p><p>Last night, she had felt sensuous, desirable . . . almost beautiful\u2014and she hadn\u2019t felt that way since she was labeled a \u201ccharity case\u201d at fifteen years old.</p><p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t do this,\u201d she whispered, but he pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cA mere kiss,\u201d he whispered back. At first he didn\u2019t even touch his lips to hers. Instead he opened his mouth against her neck, licking her in a way that sent her mind reeling.</p><p>She meant to turn away. She meant to say no, to break free.</p><p>Instead she wrapped her arms around his neck and tipped her head back, delighting in the way he held her up, as if she weighed nothing, as if she were as delicate as a flower.</p><p>Suddenly panic bloomed in her stomach. She was behaving like a wanton in front of the house, where anyone could see. The servants. Gaunt. \u201cStop,\u201d she gasped. \u201cI must go to the stables. Charlie will be waiting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Vander said easily, his hands slipping away. \u201cIf you must go to the stables, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d He took her arm and they began to walk. \u201cAnd if you come,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment, but when she grasped his double entendre Mia felt color flood into her face. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean what you just said!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not in the front drive.\u201d His smile acknowledged the desire between them with a frankness she could never have imagined.</p><p>Just looking at his lips made her want another kiss. She craved more than a kiss. She wanted the bliss of last night, the way their limbs had slid over each other like water, the way his fingers had stroked her into a mindlessness where she needn\u2019t worry about her figure or her breasts. Or anything else.</p><p>She could just be.</p><p>They reached the first of the stables, but rather than enter, Vander steered her around the back. \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d Mia asked.</p><p>When they were around the corner, out of sight of the house, he picked her up, braced her against the wall, and took her mouth. A craving, toe-curling hunger vibrated between them.</p><p>Vander pulled back just enough to lick her lips, his tongue flickering against hers, driving her into a low moan.</p><p>The sound startled her into sanity. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can hear,\u201d he said thickly. \u201cThis building is not used as it\u2019s too old and unsafe.\u201d</p><p>She succumbed. They spoke without words, just murmurs of hunger, an emotion as primitive as greed.</p><p>As love.</p><p>Mia scarcely noticed that Vander was hauling up her skirts; all she could hear was her own harsh breath and the way her body felt empty, waiting for him. Every touch of his hands on her legs kindled the fire in her higher until she couldn\u2019t think straight.</p><p>The flimsy skirts of her morning gown were no barrier. Vander pulled back, just enough to meet her eyes. One hand was curled under her bottom, but he had jerked her legs wide, around his hips.</p><p>Mia was stunned into silence by the scalding ache between her legs. Vander was fumbling at his breeches with his other hand, but it didn\u2019t occur to her to demur. Instead she waited, her heart beating quickly, yearning for him.</p><p>His eyes were fixed on her mouth. \u201cI must have you,\u201d he said, his voice low and hoarse. \u201cI need you again.\u201d</p><p>His face wasn\u2019t beautiful now; it was savage, demanding, almost cruel. His fingers stroked her and Mia gave a little cry.</p><p>And then he was there.</p><p>What had been discomfort the night before was pain now . . . but exquisite pain. She gave a little gasp, her hands closing on his shoulders. He stopped instantly, his breath harsh, forehead against hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he growled. \u201cIs it too soon?\u201d</p><p>Irrationally, the only thing Mia thought was that she didn\u2019t want him in control so that he could think, could talk, could leave her. She leaned forward and let her tongue slide between his lips as if she\u2019d done it a hundred times.</p><p>At the same time, she curled her legs around his hips and forced his rigid thick length into her body. A cry burst from her throat and was swallowed by him . . . he was kissing her, but she hardly knew it. His weight pushed her legs so wide that as he pressed forward and withdrew, it sent exquisite sensations through her thighs, a fiery sensation gathering in her limbs.</p><p>She broke the kiss when she threw back her head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d His words were more a groan than a growl, the bass note to the pumping of his hips against her. He was sliding easily now, driving her higher and higher into incoherence.</p><p>She bucked against him when she came, a cry wrenched from her chest and swallowed by Vander\u2019s mouth on hers. Her fingers tightened until she was clinging to him as if he were a raft in the heart of a storm, her body jerking uncontrollably, guttural ecstasy escaping her lips.</p><p>Vander gasped something in reply, a curse, a blessing, and he began thrusting even faster, grunting with as little elegance as she had shown.</p><p>Mia could feel him deep and hard inside her, but more than that, she knew instinctively that he was lost to himself, lost to the pleasure she was giving him. He was holding her as if he would never let her go. The thought made her legs clamp around his hips and push back toward him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A word fell from his lips but she wasn\u2019t listening. Their eyes met and like that, the fire burst up her legs again. She writhed against the wall, twisting in his fierce grip, her moans fracturing in the air. The only thing in the world was the fierce weight of his body.</p><p>The hand Vander had braced on the wall over her head came down and he pulled her head toward him, taking her mouth with a hot, wet kiss, his body jerking so hard that her backbone struck the wall.</p><p>She\u2019d have a bruise, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>She cared about nothing but the heat searing her body, the mouth slammed down on hers, the grunt as he pressed home one last time.</p> <p>Mia opened her eyes, finally, to discover that she was staring up at the ancient eaves of the roof above her head. Her mind tried to put pieces of herself, her inner self, back together.</p><p>She felt as if the two of them had cracked and flown apart, broken by pleasure. Last night had been wonderful, but in retrospect, it had been civilized. This was mating: sweaty, grunting, incomprehensible.</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t been alone. She risked a look at Vander\u2019s face and saw he was stunned as she was. He withdrew slowly and lowered her to the ground; her skirts fell over legs so weak that she clung to him for fear she\u2019d crumple.</p><p>Last night, he had been tender and desirous, soothing her when it stung, whispering reassurances in her ear.</p><p>Today, he had uttered only one word, a word she had scarcely registered in the instant. What was it he\u2019d said?</p> <p>Then it came to her: greedy.</p><p>That\u2019s what he\u2019d said.</p><p>That was the word.</p><p>She glanced down, feeling as if she were in some sort of odd dream, and watched as he buttoned up his breeches.</p><p>Greedy. The word grew and grew until it occupied all the space in her head.</p><p>The tingling she felt now wasn\u2019t the pleasurable kind. \u201cWhat did you mean by that?\u201d she whispered, and then cleared her throat and elaborated, \u201cBy that word?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes moved slowly to hers. The good thing was that he looked as stupefied as she felt. Her hair had fallen down her back. His beard had scraped her face and her neck, and her legs ached because she had clung to him with all her strength. And other parts of her . . .</p><p>Ached too.</p><p>\u201cWhat word?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>He was staring down at his wife, trying to work out what had just taken place between them. He had been with many women before; he\u2019d sampled women as if he were at a banquet.</p><p>He regarded women the way he regarded food: necessary and sometimes delectable, but ultimately a distraction.</p><p>He had spent hours upon hours training a single horse. He would never spend hours on a woman. Hell, he\u2019d never even had a mistress who lasted more than a few months. Either they wanted more, or he became bored\u2014whichever came first.</p><p>But he had never had an experience like this one. A moment ago everything in him had turned inside out and poured into Mia. And he wasn\u2019t done, either. Even though he was still shaking, all he wanted was to scoop her up and head back to the house to start all over again.</p><p>A man could lose himself in a woman like this. He could find himself tied to her, so tightly that he would go mad if she strayed.</p> <p>If she left him.</p><p>The way his father had broken.</p><p>\u201cYou said \u2018greedy.\u2019\u201d Mia\u2019s voice was hoarse.</p><p>Bloody hell, she was beautiful. All that bright hair had fallen around her shoulders, and her skin had turned rose where his stubble had scraped it. She had that perfect nose, and pointed chin, and her eyes were exquisite.</p><p>How had he ever thought he preferred blue eyes? He liked green eyes, dark green eyes like water tumbling in a Highland stream, reflecting pine trees.</p><p>There was nothing sunny and sweet about Mia. She was all hidden depths and passion. Her lips were plump and red, and looking at them made him start to harden, even though he\u2019d just poured himself into her.</p><p>This was unacceptable.</p><p>The feeling lent itself to what he said, sharpened his voice though he didn\u2019t mean it that way.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re greedy for me,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cI had you pinned against the wall and you wanted more. Hell, if\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped. What was he doing, talking to a lady like that? Not just a lady, but his wife?</p><p>Mia\u2019s cheeks first turned red, and then pale. She swallowed so hard that he saw her throat ripple. She bent her head and hair fell across her face; when she looked back up a second later, her eyes were calm and her face empty.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look angry. Or hurt.</p><p>But she was.</p><p>Vander felt another stab of irritation about that, because he didn\u2019t like that he could read her face. He didn\u2019t care to wonder whether a woman was angry.</p><p>If she was angry, she was welcome to leave. If he disappointed her, she could leave. If he asked for too much, she could leave.</p><p>Or he could leave.</p><p>But he was married to Mia.</p><p>Neither of them could leave.</p><p>And even worse, he didn\u2019t want to go anywhere. It was as if her wedding ring strung a chain between them, because even now, after insulting her, he was hard and he wanted more than anything to take her back into his bed and fill her up.</p><p>That feeling sent a spasm of panic through him, and he didn\u2019t care that her face was no longer flushed and pretty and open to him, her eyes soft.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want a woman with an open face. Or softness in all the right places, including her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSome women are greedy for a cock, and men love that,\u201d he said, stepping back and rearranging his breeches because commanding his tool to go down wasn\u2019t working. \u201cIt was a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018A compliment,\u2019\u201d Mia repeated.</p><p>She gave her skirts a shake and pulled at her bodice, which stretched the fabric against her breasts.</p><p>He had to force his eyes away, because another streak of madness went through him. He had never made love to a woman\u2014gone mad with lust\u2014without even touching her breasts.</p><p>It had to be the novelty of marriage.</p><p>No ring would tie him to a woman, not even a woman who looked at him as if he could give her bliss. As if he had the only thing in the world she wanted\u2014without meaning his title or money.</p><p>She looked at him as if he were a king.</p><p>\u201cSo, Duchess,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s count that as part of last night, shall we? It needn\u2019t be the second of our four nights. It\u2019s morning, after all.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes weren\u2019t blank now; they were growing enraged. He welcomed it, because he could not resist her if she looked at him with aching hunger. If she looked at him that way again, as if she were greedy for him, he would follow her anywhere. Probably on his knees.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>\u201cMy treat,\u201d he added, and tapped her chin with his finger.</p><p>Her hand came up so quickly that he saw only a blur. She caught him hard across the cheek with her open hand. His head jerked back, but he welcomed the sting.</p><p>He deserved it, taking a lady against the stable wall with no more finesse than a man takes a cheap whore.</p><p>Gentlemen didn\u2019t treat their wives that way. They didn\u2019t behave like sailors on shore after a nine-month-long voyage. She had driven him mad. If she would allow it, he would have her against the wall again, her lush body cradled in his.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen anything more erotic than the way Mia threw her head back, lips open, when she came. There was nothing feigned about it. She\u2019d responded with her whole body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vander caught a hint of something . . . a delicious, heated hint of Mia, sweat and desire and honeysuckle. All of a sudden he was caught up in an erotic haze and took a step closer to her. Yet his words came out haltingly. \u201cI apologize for my remarks. They were deeply inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI am not a jam tart!\u201d The words came out in a scream.</p> <p>What?</p><p>She was gone. Vander fell back against the stable wall, his knees weak, staring after his wife. His duchess.</p><p>A jam tart? Where in the hell had that come from? He\u2019d no idea, though now he thought on it, she was like a jam tart. She was like sweet treacle and he\u2019d like to eat her up.</p><p>Slowly his mind cleared. A memory came to him: Rotter calling Mia a jam tart years ago.</p><p>He had been appallingly rude, far more so than Rotter. He would likely have to grovel.</p> <p>Of course he would grovel. He would make their excuses to Charlie and Chuffy, and follow her to the house.</p><p>Now Mia wasn\u2019t in front of him, he remembered that there were things he hadn\u2019t done with her . . . to her. Even though he\u2019d just come, he was throbbing, damn it. Throbbing the way he had as a boy, on the verge of an unacceptable loss of control.</p><p>He wanted the jam tart. He wanted to eat his wife over and over, make her throw back her head like that until she was dizzy with it. Until he could rear up and pull her small body under his and pound into it.</p><p>He leaned against the stable wall, trying to force his mind elsewhere. The sky was pale blue and far away, and a hawk circled far above, below a single cloud. He rearranged his breeches again, trying to make room for a body part that no longer fit in his smalls.</p><p>He ached all over, his body telling him that there was only one thing he wanted.</p><p>Mia.</p> <p>Thanks to his being an ass, he had exactly three nights in the rest of the year to enjoy her.</p><p>One would have to be tonight. Tonight . . . the promise of it sang in his blood. She was angry, but she would get over it.</p><p>He would tell her the truth: if she was greedy, he was as starving as a man who not only had been at sea for months on end, but at sea without food.</p><p>Surely she would understand. And they did have three nights left.</p><p>A slow smile curled his lips. That would be enough to take the edge off this frantic lust. He\u2019d never slept with a woman for more than two nights in a row. He got bored.</p><p>Tonight should do it.</p><p>The second night would break the spell.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p> <p>NOTES ON CASTLE PLUM</p><p>~ After Frederic continues on his fruitless quest, the Evil Lord Plum discovers Flora unconscious amongst the poppies and takes her to his castle.</p><p>\u201cThe dark air hovering around Castle Plum drew attention to the ravages of time, visible in some parts of the building.

Vander would follow her to apologize, and she would be unable to keep him out.</p><p>She went straight into the bathing chamber, put the hook on both doors, and looked about for a place to sit. There were two alternatives: the bathtub or on the floor. She chose the floor.</p><p>She sank down, so devastated that for some seconds she didn\u2019t even breathe, let alone cry.</p><p>Their marriage was only two days old and already a pattern was being established: Vander would blurt out the truth about how he felt.</p><p>Afterward, he would apologize and pay her false compliments . . . until the next time he let slip just how little respect he had for her.</p><p>Even worse\u2014and she hated this truth\u2014he hadn\u2019t been wrong: she was greedy for him.</p><p>She had written that poem all those years ago. She had created the moonbeam, even if she hadn\u2019t known what she was talking about. She had dreamed he entered her bedchamber. Somehow, just by being around him, that side of her sprang back to life.</p><p>She had allowed him to pull up her skirts and take her against a wall. It didn\u2019t matter that he was her husband. In a way, it was worse.</p><p>Real ladies were never treated that way. He had seduced her without a single compliment or an adoring glance, no matter how insincere. How could she blame him?</p><p>She had agreed, if tacitly, to being demeaned. She had opened her legs and let him do what he willed.</p><p>If at any point she had said \u201cno,\u201d Vander would have stopped.</p><p>That was what hurt the most. She didn\u2019t want to be a woman like that. Words knocked around in her head, ugly words: greedy, cock, pearls . . . jam tart. They brought on tears that streamed down her face until she had her head on her knees, sobbing.</p><p>Sure enough, after a while, there was a knock on the door leading to Vander\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, taking a shuddering breath. \u201cPlease go away.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence, followed by the sound of retreating footsteps. Seconds later, the door to her bedchamber rattled.</p><p>\u201cThey are both locked,\u201d she said, choking. \u201cJust leave me alone, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>It would seem that dukes expected to get their way all the time, even when their duchesses were desperate to be alone.</p><p>\u201cGo away!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to talk to you. I must apologize.\u201d</p><p>Mia heard a floorboard squeak as Vander shifted his weight. She had known that apology was coming. Did she care to hear it? Not particularly.</p><p>He had already made clear what he thought. And he\u2019d said it in the heat of passion, when a man couldn\u2019t lie if he tried. What he\u2019d said was real. It was no great surprise he was now sorry he\u2019d blurted that out. He was a decent man, and he didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t make it any less truthful.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around her knees. \u201cI accept your apology,\u201d she said, clearing her throat and raising her voice. \u201cI shall be out in an hour or so. Please give me some privacy.\u201d</p><p>She began pulling herself back together. After all, she wasn\u2019t sluttish all the time. Only around him. Her poem had been innocently desirous.</p><p>Not that she was innocent any longer. She had taken one look at his unbuttoned breeches, and she would have done anything to have him thrust inside her. Lie down on the ground, on the gravel, probably.</p><p>Another tear slid down her cheek.</p><p>Up against the stable wall.</p><p>She shuddered at the memory. If she could just get away from Vander, she could regain her self-respect. She wasn\u2019t like this with other men. She knew with absolute certainty that she would never have behaved like this with Edward.</p><p>They would have had an affectionate marital life, intimacies conducted under the bedcovers, with respect.</p><p>Love would have come in time. She had already loved him a bit. Or, at least, she had been tremendously fond of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDuchess!\u201d It seemed that her husband was growing annoyed. Her thoughts darkened. Vander ought to shoulder some blame as well. He had treated her like a hired harlot, even though she was his duchess.</p><p>The door rattled in its frame, more forcefully now. \u201cOpen this door!\u201d</p><p>Did he really think that roaring at her would make any difference? He was far too used to getting his own way. Women had probably melted in front of him from the time he was . . . oh . . . fourteen. Thirteen, she thought, remembering what he looked like at that age.</p><p>The door rattled some more and he began ranting about something or other, but she had stopped listening.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he said something about a race tomorrow or the next day? A pulse of relief went through her. He would be gone soon.</p><p>Suddenly she heard Susan\u2019s voice, and Vander ordering her to take herself downstairs, which he hadn\u2019t any right to do.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my maid!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Susan abandoned her, of course; she could hardly refuse the duke\u2019s command.</p><p>There was a huge thump and the whole door vibrated.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Mia shrieked. \u201cNottle said that door was imported from Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>Another resounding thud.</p><p>\u201cIt probably cost as much as a thatched roof! Don\u2019t you dare break it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen open the door. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be alone,\u201d she cried. \u201cIs that so hard to understand? I want to think.\u201d</p><p>His voice quieted. \u201cDon\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? Do you think that you can rule every moment of my day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking that I don\u2019t respect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not.\u201d There was no point in dwelling on unpleasant truths.</p><p>The door rattled again. \u201cMia, if you don\u2019t open this door, I shall break it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, do go away, why don\u2019t you!\u201d she snapped. \u201cYou don\u2019t care how I\u2019m feeling. I\u2019m the wife you loathe, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do not loathe you.\u201d</p><p>Her answer was a curse that she had never spoken aloud before. In fact, now she thought about it, he brought out all her worst tendencies.</p><p>\u201cI do not loathe you,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you did that to me, and you said those things. A man only treats a woman he loathes in that manner.\u201d She kept her voice steady even though another tear ran down her cheek. \u201cOr a woman he\u2019s paid for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Another thud, and the door bowed ominously inward for a long instant. With a shriek, the lock gave way and the entire hook and eye assembly flew across the chamber, smashing into one of the long mirrors.</p><p>She turned from gaping at the cracked glass to see Vander standing in the doorway, looking so stormy and beautiful that her heart temporarily lodged in her throat. \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate these damned mirrors. In fact, I loathe everything about this room.\u201d</p><p>Mia wrapped her arms around her knees and put her head down again.</p><p>Edward would never have treated her like a harlot. He had kissed her with reverence. Once he even dropped a kiss on her forehead for no reason.</p><p>Vander hadn\u2019t kissed her when they wed, not even when the vicar bade him to. It was no wonder that his kisses were more like invasions than demonstrations of respectful affection. His kisses were just about lust, brute lust.</p><p>He stood over her now, as big and tall as a pine tree. Mia refused to look up. He could glower and bully her all he wanted.</p><p>Then Vander hunkered down before her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duchess. I shouldn\u2019t have said those things. They were unconscionable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Mia said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you had your reasons. It hardly matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does matter, because I\u2019ve hurt your feelings and I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>At that she raised her head. \u201cYes, you did mean to hurt my feelings. No man would speak in that manner unless he deliberately wished to hurt. But at least you were speaking the truth. I prefer the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat truth?\u201d He sounded frustrated.</p><p>\u201cYou were correct. I\u2014I bewhored myself.\u201d Her voice wavered a little. Whore was such an ugly word; she had never thought to apply it to herself. But she would never have thought that she could behave in such a manner either. \u201cAll the same, I saw in your eyes that you wanted to hurt my feelings, so don\u2019t try to insult me by pretending otherwise.\u201d</p><p>He sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t deserve that from you,\u201d she said, steadying her voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say a single nice thing to me. Not even one. I may not have behaved like a lady, but neither were you a gentleman. I think they treat doxies with some respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not behave like a doxy.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s gut clenched. \u201cYes, I did. There\u2019s nothing you or I can do to change that. I have\u2014I have a part of me that I loathe, but I will spend the rest of my life taking control of these disgusting urges. I vow it.\u201d</p><p>He flinched at her words; then his hands clamped on her arms and he lifted her straight into his lap.</p><p>Mia gave a startled yelp. \u201cLet go of me! Just because I\u2019m small doesn\u2019t mean you can keep moving me about like a doll.\u201d</p><p>It felt good to be in the circle of his arms, though.</p><p>\u201cThere was nothing disgusting about what we did.\u201d His voice was firm and unwavering. \u201cAnd you are beautiful, not loathsome.\u201d</p><p>Mia would have snorted, but she remembered just in time that ladies don\u2019t snort.</p><p>\u201cI behaved like an ass afterward,\u201d he said. \u201cI just\u2014 I\u2019m not used to feeling that way while bedding a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Bedding!\u2019\u201d Her voice was bitter. \u201cThat would imply we got as far as a bed. I wasn\u2019t even worth a pair of sheets.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a gentle shake. \u201cI was overcome. We both were. And Duchess, I\u2019ve never been that mad for anyone. Any woman. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s heart missed a beat.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to refinement, I\u2019m an ass,\u201d Vander said. \u201cI didn\u2019t bother to learn ballroom etiquette and the rest of it. But I have never found myself so overcome by lust that I couldn\u2019t even get to a bed. You turn me into a madman. That\u2019s the truth, if you care to hear it.\u201d</p><p>An involuntary shudder ran through Mia. His arm tightened, pulling her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI feel that way now,\u201d Vander told her, his voice low and gruff. \u201cI just had you, and all I want is to take you again. I could do it on the floor or in that bathtub. I see you, and I want to get close. I smell you, and I want to taste. I taste you, and the only thing I want is to shove myself inside and ride you until you scream with pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s entire body turned liquid at his words and she couldn\u2019t find an answer.</p><p>\u201cIf you think I have ever spoken to any woman the way I spoke to you,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou\u2019d be mistaken. I may not prance around like a court dandy, but I\u2019m a decent man. I have paid for my pleasures because I don\u2019t like adultery and I don\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014want to marry. But I have always been courteous. I\u2019ve never behaved like a lunatic, not until I met you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mia closed her eyes. She didn\u2019t know what to think.</p><p>\u201cFour nights won\u2019t be enough,\u201d he said, his voice rasping.</p><p>She struggled to keep up with what he was saying. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is some sort of erotic madness.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI think it will burn out. I don\u2019t want you to . . . I don\u2019t want you to fall in love with me again, because I\u2019ll end up hurting you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said swiftly. \u201cDo you think I could love anyone who would treat me this disrespectfully?\u201d It was a lie. She loved him so much that she ached with it. But she couldn\u2019t let him know. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He would walk away, leaving her devastated. But at least if he didn\u2019t know how she felt, she could keep the humiliation to herself.</p><p>His hand stroked her arm. \u201cI know it can be hard for women to keep their feelings separate when they\u2019re making love.\u201d</p><p>Was he feeling sorry for her? Again? Mia straightened and glared at him. \u201cVander, there is nothing that could get me to fall in love with you after what happened years ago at that musicale, let alone your coarse behavior this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said immediately. Still, she could tell that he believed he was so irresistible that she would fall for him anyway.</p> <p>\u201cI have been in love,\u201d she told him, keeping her gaze unwavering.</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d His thumb rubbed across her lip. \u201cYou\u2019ve been biting it again. Your bottom lip has turned the color of a ripe strawberry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with you. That was a silly infatuation, and I was only a girl. I hardly knew you.\u201d</p><p>His thumb stopped.</p><p>\u201cMy fianc\u00e9, Theodore Edward Braxton Reeve, courted me for a year and we were betrothed for another year. I knew him very well\u2014and I fell in love with him.\u201d She wasn\u2019t precisely telling the whole truth, but it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>A dark emotion flashed through his eyes. \u201cYou still love the man who jilted you?\u201d</p> <p>Mia ignored that question. It was none of his business, and he would like her answer too much. \u201cEdward is brilliant, handsome, and very kind. He is a professor at Oxford, and he knows your friend Thorn. In fact, I believe Mr. Dautry bought a machine of some sort from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe patent for a machine,\u201d Vander said slowly. \u201cI remember now that Reeve was the man who designed a continuous paper-making machine. Thorn made a fortune on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs did Edward,\u201d Mia said, a trace of pride appearing in her voice, even though the last thing she should do is feel pride for the man who had jilted her.</p><p>Vander\u2019s hand slid down to her throat, an indescribably soft caress. \u201cI find it harder and harder to believe that he left you at the altar.\u201d</p><p>Was it worse to say cutting things to her, as Vander did, or to leave her, as Edward had done? Mia cleared her throat. \u201cMy point is that you needn\u2019t worry that I will become infatuated with you, simply because you made love to me against the wall of the stable. If that is the right word for what we did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not.\u201d He leaned down and whispered a different word in her ear.</p><p>Mia felt herself turning bright red. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t use that word in my presence, let alone to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the madness I fall into when you\u2019re around me,\u201d Vander said, his voice rasping. \u201cI want you, Duchess. I want you so badly that I\u2019m having trouble thinking even right now. You\u2019re telling me that you are still in love with that miserable son of a bitch you were betrothed to, and I\u2019m sorry about that. All the same, the only thing I want to do is lie down and pull you on top of me.\u201d</p> <p>On top? Mia gave that a second\u2019s thought before returning to the subject at hand. \u201cYou see my point, don\u2019t you? You needn\u2019t worry that I will fall in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Reeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward broke my heart.\u201d</p><p>His thumb swept along her chin, and he said, \u201cI hate to hear that, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well . . .\u201d She suddenly realized exactly what she was feeling under her bottom.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you have the most luscious arse in all Christendom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shifted her weight, just to see that flare of dark lust in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to get the idea that you have no idea what effect you have on men.\u201d</p><p>Mia stopped wiggling. \u201cI have no effect on men. And I don\u2019t want you to pay me compliments that you don\u2019t mean.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cThat\u2014what we did earlier\u2014it wasn\u2019t ladylike. But on the other hand, it was real. It hurt to be characterized the way you did, but I can see that the truth is preferable to insincere flattery.\u201d</p><p>He frowned down at her. \u201cI would have complimented you, but lust had such a grip on my throat that I couldn\u2019t do more than pant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start making what\u2019s between us into some sort of romance. Or flattering me. I know what you think of me.\u201d</p><p>His arms tightened again. \u201cHow can you know what I think of you?\u201d</p><p>Mia put his arm aside and pushed herself to her feet. She had to get this straight. It was bad enough when he lashed out, calling her greedy.</p><p>But it would be worse if he started whispering things he didn\u2019t mean. That would endanger her heart. She might begin to believe him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to fuss,\u201d she said, giving him a big smile. \u201cSee? I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not crying. There\u2019s no need to flatter me.\u201d</p><p>He stood up. And up. He was so tall, compared to her. She folded her arms over her breasts and looked at him. \u201cI shall see how Charlie is. After I wash my face and change my gown, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should retire to a bed and celebrate our newfound truce,\u201d Vander suggested.</p><p>Mia felt as if she had been torn apart that morning and clumsily put back together. Not just physically, either. She shook her head.</p><p>Vander paused, a frown on his face, as if he guessed how battered she felt. She summoned up another smile. \u201cPerhaps, if you\u2019re very, very lucky, I\u2019ll request the second of your four nights soon.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. \u201cI\u2019m amending the agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Mia discovered that she was trembling all over. Being enveloped in Vander\u2019s arms, against his hard chest, was enough to make her want to moan.</p><p>\u201cFour nights a month,\u201d he said, leaning down and biting her earlobe.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, hell, four nights a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot just change the contract whenever you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI set the rules,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cYou agreed to whatever I decreed. As far as you were concerned, my letter could have said you had to appear in my bed seven nights a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late to change a legal agreement,\u201d she managed.</p><p>His lips brushed her ear again and her knees turned liquid. \u201cMaybe four nights a year, but also four afternoons a week. Starting today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d Mia began.</p><p>But Vander cut her off. He hitched her up against his body in such a smooth motion that Mia could tell it was becoming second nature. He kissed her into silence, and when he raised his head, he said only, \u201cDuchess.\u201d His voice was dark as black velvet, and that smooth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . somewhat tender,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an animal,\u201d he said, pulling her tighter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Duchess.\u201d</p> <p>Mia was beginning to enjoy the way he called her Duchess, even though she understood it was a way of avoiding intimacy. She wasn\u2019t one of his friends; he wouldn\u2019t call her Mia.</p><p>All the same, she loved being called Duchess. His duchess.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mind that much,\u201d she whispered. She put out her tongue and very delicately touched the indent at the base of his throat.</p><p>He gave a strangled groan. \u201cRight. Perhaps in a few days. I\u2019m going to the stables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, kissing the tiny patch of moistened skin on his neck. He tasted like sweat and desire.</p> <p>\u201cDo you think that we might renegotiate your ban on being touched here?\u201d He put a finger on her collarbone and slid down.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mia said instantly. She shifted her weight and he let her slide down his body to stand on her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you already.\u201d</p><p>Vander gave her a look that made heat shoot through her stomach. \u201cYou will have to tell me again.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about her bosom.

By the time Susan poked her head around the bedroom door, Mia had managed to pull off her morning gown. The back, she saw with dismay, was stained the color of decaying wood.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t come clean,\u201d Susan said, with a saucy grin. \u201cThe fabric was already pilling. I\u2019ll give it to the housekeeper to make rags with. May I ask whether you had an accident, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask,\u201d Mia said. \u201cWhat should I put on? I haven\u2019t any gowns that aren\u2019t black or gray. Though no one cares what I wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they do,\u201d Susan said. \u201cBelieve me, they do. Everyone in this house thinks your husband is the next best thing to royalty.\u201d She had opened the clothes press and was poking about in the shelves. \u201cThis will do.\u201d</p><p>She brought out an amethyst gown that Mia had last worn two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019ll be large in the waist, but it will do until Madame duBois arrives tomorrow morning. She might even get here as early as this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA modiste?\u201d Mia asked, unenthusiastically. Seamstresses promised miracles, but she always ended up looking like a stubby woman with large breasts.</p> <p>\u201cMadame duBois makes gowns for all the very best people.\u201d Susan lowered her voice. \u201cAnd some who are not: she has made frocks for Maria Fitzherbert, and you know what they say about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has caught the prince\u2019s eye,\u201d Mia said. \u201cBut, Susan\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore to the point, Maria Fitzherbert is short. Tiny! Short as you are, if not shorter. I directed Madame to bring along any garments she might have partially constructed for petite clients. I promised her that the duke would pay three times her going rate for ready-sewn gowns.\u201d</p><p>Mia sighed. Poor Vander had been forced to marry; the least she could do was not cost him too much money.</p><p>\u201cYou must dress as befits your station,\u201d Susan stated.</p><p>If she was going to be a duchess for more than six months, then Susan was right. \u201cVery well,\u201d Mia said, resigned.</p><p>Her maid\u2019s eyebrow rose. \u201cDoes that mean that you\u2019ll agree to lower your bodice below your collarbone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Mia agreed. Adding, \u201cIf I must. Perhaps only in the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you want to look like a maiden aunt who is pretending to be a young duchess, you must. I didn\u2019t argue when you were at Carrington House, because you rarely attended any sort of social event. But it will be different now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that sort of gown every day,\u201d Mia protested. \u201cOnly if I have to make an appearance as a duchess.\u201d</p><p>Susan crossed her arms. \u201cMr. Dautry and Lady Xenobia live less than two hours away, and His Grace\u2019s man told me that they visit often. Your appearance reflects on me, and I can\u2019t imagine what Lady Xenobia\u2019s maid would say of your wardrobe. I cannot face her if your clothing is not \u00e0 la mode. In the evening and in the day.\u201d</p><p>Mia knew when she\u2019d been beaten.</p><p>She\u2019d probably end up with a wardrobe full of gowns whose necklines landed just above her waist. The gleam in Vander\u2019s eyes came back to her . . .</p><p>Presumably, he would enjoy them, even if she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>MORE NOTES ON CASTLE PLUM</p><p>~ the evil Lord Plum has deceitfully confused Flora\u2019s affections by giving her lavish compliments and gifts. He rains insults on the man who jilted her.</p><p>~ what if Frederic happens on the castle, and is invited to dinner to meet Lord Plum\u2019s fianc\u00e9e: Flora!</p><p>Count Frederic was appalled to find that the lovely, modest, artless, bashful, yet warm-hearted girl he jilted at the altar has become a young woman of fashion, resplendent in jewels and displaying an Artful Fastidiousness in attiring herself.</p><p>~ Pale face now too thin for true beauty.</p><p>Two days later</p><p>Charlie was proving to be a fine equestrian. He had a tendency to favor his weak leg, which affected the direction in which his horse turned, but in time he\u2019d get over that. More importantly, he loved everything about horses, and he especially loved Jafeer.</p><p>And Jafeer seemed to be cautiously affectionate in return; Vander had the idea that his new stallion considered the boy to be Mia\u2019s colt. Anything the duchess liked, Jafeer liked.</p><p>At the moment Vander was standing on the side of the yard, watching Charlie go around on his wife\u2019s palfrey, Lancelot. He had a groom guiding the horse with a line.</p><p>His wife. Wife. Vander still couldn\u2019t get around that word. He\u2019d been blackmailed into marriage, but somehow a fact that had enraged him mere days ago seemed irrelevant now.</p><p>Mia Carrington was his wife, no matter how it happened. Jafeer adored her. Hell, everyone adored her.</p><p>She was the sort of woman who made a person try his damnedest to get her attention. He caught himself performing like a boy, trying to come up with witticisms to bring out that throaty laugh of hers.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even concentrate on his work, because he spent his time thinking about Mia and all the things he meant to do with her once she felt ready.</p><p>How long did it take a deflowered virgin to recover from said deflowering? It wasn\u2019t the sort of question men talked about. He felt an absurd sense of pride, knowing that he was the only man who\u2019d ever touched Mia intimately, plunged into her.</p><p>He wanted more. And more still. His lust had become so overwhelming that he had taken care not to touch her at all in the last two days. He hadn\u2019t even brushed up against her on the stairs. He didn\u2019t trust himself.</p><p>In any case, she spent most of the time tucked away in her room working on her novel. She and Chuffy talked with great animation throughout the evening meals while Vander watched.</p><p>Mia\u2019s hands would wave in the air, describing the spacious and magnificent apartments of some castle in which her heroine was taking refuge. Hell, if she wanted a castle, he could buy her one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chuffy had her in fits of laughter every night, suggesting wilder and wilder plot twists. Vander had nothing to contribute but common sense.</p><p>\u201cThat girl\u2014Flora, isn\u2019t it?\u2014would be a fool to go back to the man who jilted her,\u201d Vander had pointed out the night before. \u201cFrederic is as limp as a noodle. It\u2019s despicable that he is \u2018bathed in tears\u2019 after jilting Flora. She should find someone better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrederic is the hero,\u201d Mia told him. \u201cShe can\u2019t simply \u2018find someone\u2019! There can be only one hero in a novel.\u201d</p><p>In fact, Chuffy and Mia ignored most of his suggestions. Last night they had spent an hour discussing whether the castle should be haunted by the \u201cmoaning voice of some unquiet spirit.\u201d</p> <p>What with the unquiet spirit, the milksop hero, and the evil Lord Plum, the castle sounded like a version of Dante\u2019s hell. Vander had jocosely suggested that the spirits of four slain princes, all heirs to the Crown, should haunt the castle ramparts\u2014only to have his jest taken seriously and put into play with foolish Frederic.</p><p>When Mia wasn\u2019t writing\u2014or conspiring with Chuffy\u2014she was sequestered with a seamstress. Making herself into a duchess, by all accounts. It was ridiculous. He didn\u2019t want her to change.</p><p>He loped across the yard to Charlie. \u201cThree more times around. Don\u2019t forget to groom your mount.\u201d</p><p>Charlie nodded. His eyes shone and both his posture and his seat were good, considering he was a new rider. Vander reached over and tapped his weaker leg. \u201cHow\u2019s this feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Charlie said instantly.</p> <p>Beginning to ache, Vander diagnosed, seeing faint smudges under the boy\u2019s eyes. Charlie was not a complainer. \u201cThree more times,\u201d he repeated, and headed for the house.</p><p>To find his wife. Ridiculous though that sounded, he\u2019d hardly seen her except at evening meals, when Chuffy was there, taking all her attention.</p><p>Not that he was jealous of his own uncle.</p><p>It was merely that his irrational fit of lust had turned her from a near stranger to the only person he cared to spend time with.</p><p>Nodding at Gaunt, he ran up the stairs into his bedchamber and straight through to the bathing chamber. The door leading to his wife\u2019s room had been repaired, he noticed. That broken latch had undoubtedly caused a storm of speculation downstairs.</p><p>He was devoutly hoping that he\u2019d discover her in dishabille, perhaps naked to the waist while being fitted for a gown.</p> <p>Alas, no such luck; her bedchamber was empty. He returned to the hallway, went to the top of the stairs, and bellowed down, \u201cWhere\u2019s my duchess?\u201d</p><p>Nottle had not been the sort of butler who would deign to raise his voice, but Gaunt was not as rigidly formal. He shouted back, \u201cHer Grace is in her study.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Her study,\u2019\u201d Vander repeated, feeling like an idiot. \u201cWhere is that?\u201d</p><p>He had no memory of her mentioning it at supper, and when else were they supposed to discuss things? He was out of the house all day working in the stables, and they weren\u2019t sleeping together.</p><p>\u201cHer Grace is using the Queen\u2019s Bedchamber as her study,\u201d Gaunt replied, appearing at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cThe great bed remains, but we moved a desk from the library.\u201d</p><p>A moment later Vander pushed open the door to the Queen\u2019s Bedchamber, only to find this room, too, unoccupied. Sunlight poured through the west-facing windows; he\u2019d forgotten how much light this side of the house received.</p><p>He walked over to her desk and picked up a sheet of paper. Mia\u2019s handwriting hadn\u2019t changed much from when she was a girl, writing that love poem. It was a strong hand, with a beautiful, high-flung curve on some of the letters. It hadn\u2019t a trace of the madness that clung to his father\u2019s hand, or the timidity that characterized his mother\u2019s.</p><p>After it became clear that he refused to be in the vicinity of Lord Carrington, the duchess began to write letters to him. Her words had been hedged in by excessive curlicues, ornamented with arabesques, and flourishes. He had read her letters impatiently and tossed them aside, condemning her for adultery, for selfishness.</p> <p>Now his heart bumped at the memory of Chuffy\u2019s revelation about the truth of his parents\u2019 marriage. All those years he had felt burning resentment of his mother\u2019s betrayal of his father, but the situation had been far more complicated and far more tragic than he had known.</p><p>With an impatient shake of his head, he focused on the page he had picked up, headed NOTES: Chapter Three.</p><p>\u201cI cannot bear to think of it!\u201d Lady Ryldon cried pettishly. \u201cMaurice must marry her. It has come to the very last ebb with us. We shall all be ruined if he doesn\u2019t manage it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth did she come to have such a dowry? I knew her mother, and she was a worthy woman, but their fortunes were sadly depleted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I understand it, Lord Mortimer glimpsed her in the street and wrote her into his will. It sounds very curious to me; everyone is saying that she must be his natural daughter.\u201d</p><p>That startled her friend. \u201cAbsolutely not! I knew her mother well before she was disowned by her father, the earl.\u201d</p><p>A peal of silvery musical laughter interrupted them. \u201cHere she comes!\u201d Lady Ryldon said urgently. \u201cNow, dear, you must make certain that the little fool marries my son. Our very lives\u2014or at the very least our wine cellar\u2014depend on it!\u201d</p><p>Vander stared down at the page in some perplexity. It didn\u2019t seem to match the plot he\u2019d heard discussed over the dining room table. Who was Lady Ryldon? The whole desk was covered with drifts of paper, each sheet containing a scrap of dialogue or a list of notes. He picked up another.</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d said Count Frederic, with a polite bow, \u201cmay I not kiss you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed you may not!\u201d Flora cried. She peeped at him over her shoulder, with a captivating giggle. \u201cI do not like kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me change your mind.\u201d His countenance was not merry: instead, the very air trembled with a solemn\u2014</p><p>Unfortunately, the text broke off just when it was getting interesting. Vander sifted through the mess on the desk, trying to locate the next page, but he couldn\u2019t find it. He picked up Mia\u2019s quill and struck through a half line or so, and scrawled a revision.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, do let me change your mind.\u201d He pushed her back on the table, ran a hand beneath her skirts, and bent to kiss her silken thigh.</p><p>She threw her arms around his neck and cried, \u201cBut, sir, do you intend to ravish me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you desire such a wanton course,\u201d he replied, quite untruthfully, because he intended to ravish her no matter what she had to say about it.</p><p>\u201cModesty forbids my answer,\u201d she gasped, clapping her legs around his waist.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he said, debauching her enthusiastically.</p><p>This was rather fun. Vander poked around until he found a couple of other scenes which, in his considered opinion, needed correction. Flora should never go back to Frederic, for example. He picked up the quill again.</p><p>Vander here: This is rubbish. He\u2019s a fool who jilted her. She should treat him like the idiot he is.</p><p>The door opened. He hastily put down the quill and turned around.</p><p>It was Mia, naturally, and she was frowning at him. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI seem to have been reading your memoirs,\u201d he said, strolling toward her and doing his utmost to look innocent. \u201cI had no idea your life had been so enthralling before marrying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hush,\u201d she cried, her face turning rosy. \u201cIt\u2019s horrid of you to look at my manuscript without asking me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should spice it up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpice it up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, what sort of man would say \u2018may I not kiss you now\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hero, Frederic, is extremely courteous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s an addlebrained dunce. Who would want to kiss a man like him? Clearly not your heroine, since she makes up that whopper about not liking kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrederic is a complete gentleman,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am not?\u201d Vander grinned and changed the topic. \u201cWhat on earth have you been doing? I looked all over the house for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReading,\u201d she said, a bit guiltily. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to put Miss Julia Quiplet\u2019s books down in the last two days, even though I must write my own novel. Was there something you wanted, Duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuke?\u201d Vander looked insulted. \u201cSurely we are on intimate terms?\u201d</p><p>Mia had a moment of extreme irritation.</p><p>How was she supposed to guess what Vander felt was the appropriate degree of intimacy at any given moment? He still addressed her as \u201cDuchess,\u201d after all. She avoided the question altogether. \u201cI thought you were in the stables. Is Charlie all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI set him to grooming horses. If it were up to him, he\u2019d ride all day long, but I thought his leg had taken enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should check on his progress,\u201d Mia said. Vander had a look in his eyes that she recognized, even after a few short days of marriage.</p> <p>But it was daytime. Afternoon. Servants were about.</p><p>\u201cCharlie will not miss you,\u201d he said. He took a long stride, bent his head, and pulled her into his arms. Mia had to admit that his kiss was pure bliss. She even dropped Miss Quiplet\u2019s novel.</p><p>In the last two days, she had done her best to ignore Vander at dinner, because every time she met his eyes, she felt herself turning pink. She stayed up late reading, but he never knocked on her door.</p><p>Only the raw lust in his eyes when they encountered each other about the house kept her from despair. She wasn\u2019t feeling these ground-swells of desire all on her own.</p><p>Now she kissed him with all the longing she\u2019d kept in check, coming back to herself only when she realized that her husband was nudging her backward toward the enormous bed on which Queen Elizabeth herself had slept.</p><p>\u201cWe mustn\u2019t,\u201d Mia said, pulling away. \u201cNot that . . . Not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His urgent, hungry look sent a throbbing pulse down her legs.</p><p>\u201cWe should restrict intimacies to appropriate times and places, to wit, our bedchamber at night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis room is not a stable. It\u2019s arguably the nicest bedchamber in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my study, and besides, it\u2019s daytime.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s only response was to topple both of them onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d she protested. \u201cThis just isn\u2019t proper!\u201d</p><p>Vander planted his hands on either side of her and dipped his head, running his tongue along her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>She pushed at his shoulder. \u201cWell, I do, because I don\u2019t want to be called \u2018greedy\u2019 again. Just to be clear, I am not asking you for intimacies, which are supposed to happen only at night.\u201d</p><p>He scowled down at her, with a frown that he likely thought would shake her resolve since it had terrified horse thieves in the past.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to say any more unkind things to me,\u201d she told him. \u201cIf I don\u2019t behave like a doxy, I can\u2019t be labeled one. Please, Vander, let me sit up. I\u2019m going to the stables to see Charlie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never say another unkind word to you,\u201d Vander said huskily, brushing his lips across hers once more.</p><p>She must have looked dubious, because he continued, \u201cI said those things out of fear. I want you more than is good for my self-esteem. Hell, Mia, I\u2019m turning into a man who would walk to London for one of your kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy self-esteem matters as well,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cI have no wish to become the type of woman whose husband feels he can\u2014can tup her whenever and wherever he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the type of woman whose husband wants to tup her in a bed made for Queen Elizabeth. For a queen, Mia!\u201d</p><p>He slowly lowered his weight onto her, and it was so delicious that she let out a little moan. His eyes sparked in response, and a callused hand ran up her legs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Vander said, kissing her. His fingers were teasing their way up her inner thigh. When his lips wandered to her cheekbone, Mia discovered that she had relinquished control. Again.</p><p>His fingers slipped upward, and she instinctively rolled her hips toward his caress. Despite herself, her voice came out breathily, like a silly debutante being introduced to the queen. \u201cIt\u2019s not right. Might be seen. Not . . . Not married. I mean, it\u2019s still daytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are married,\u201d Vander corrected her, as his fingers sank into her slick warmth and took on a rhythm that made her body shake, bliss hovering just outside her reach. \u201cPerhaps you truly don\u2019t wish to continue?\u201d His fingers stilled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d Her nails dug into his forearm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still daytime,\u201d Vander pointed out, his eyes devilish. He slipped a broad finger inside her.</p><p>She let out a gasp and arched against him, trying to force his finger deeper inside her.</p><p>\u201cMia,\u201d he said, voice rasping in her ear, \u201cI want to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you naked.\u201d</p><p>She froze.</p><p>\u201cAll of you,\u201d he clarified.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mia\u2019s head cleared. She would never enjoy herself under those circumstances. Especially in the daylight. She pushed his hand away and began to inch toward the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t behave like this.\u201d</p><p>He let her go and she sat up and rearranged her skirts. But her heart sank, looking at his face. His eyes were steady on hers and there was no mistaking his expression.</p><p>His wasn\u2019t the face of a man who had ever heard the word \u201cno.\u201d Well, except when he was trying to refuse her marriage proposal. That was probably the first time in his life that he had been thwarted.</p><p>This would be the second. The idea of undressing in the broad daylight filled her with horror: Vander would see every curve and dimple.</p><p>If she had married an average-looking man, she might consider it, but given the difference between them, it was inconceivable.</p><p>He was the embodiment of one of her fictional heroes\u2014excepting the fact that he wasn\u2019t madly in love with her, nor was he quiet, gentle, or even civilized.</p><p>Mia raised her chin and told him the absolute truth. \u201cI am not the sort of woman who likes to be unclothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies are very private. Chaste,\u201d she added. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are not chaste.\u201d</p><p>She flinched, and he said hastily, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Just stop. I shall not change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuchess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>His face was about as malleable as a block of marble. \u201cI intend to see you without your clothes. And I intend to touch you without your clothes. I\u2019m tired of pushing your skirts out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are far too accustomed to getting your own way,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cHas no one ever denied you in the whole of your life?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer that, just stood up and announced, \u201cI\u2019m going to remove my clothing. Brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would ruin everything for me if I had to get undressed,\u201d she explained awkwardly. \u201cI am not at ease.\u201d</p> <p>Vander frowned. \u201cDo you have a scar, Duchess? I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. Might you postpone your plan to remove your clothes until tonight, in the privacy of your chamber?\u201d</p><p>Vander wrenched off his coat, which was its own answer. Mia\u2019s heartbeat quickened. Next to go was his waistcoat. The performance reminded her of the day that he had demanded she inspect him carefully before she purchased him. How was it possible that it was less than a fortnight ago?</p><p>Late-afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows, casting shadows the color of dark copper across his skin. His shirt flew across the room. Bands of muscle corded his body, making her fingers itch to caress his hard stomach.</p><p>When he bent over to pull off his boots, panic welled up in Mia\u2019s stomach. If Vander forced her to unclothe, she would faint from pure humiliation. Taking advantage of the fact he was busy with his boots, she headed for the door.</p><p>He made it there before her.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a good idea,\u201d she said, panicked. \u201cIt is deeply improper and no one . . . no lady would tolerate it.\u201d She could smell a mixture of saddle leather and spice.</p><p>It weakened her knees, so she made her expression even more ferocious.</p><p>Vander leaned back against the door and grinned at her. He hitched his thumbs into the waistband of his breeches.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cried.</p><p>Of course he ignored her. His breeches and smalls slid down over the thighs of a man used to leaping on a restless horse. Mia let out a shaky sigh. His taut abdomen had a little line of hair that led . . .</p><p>Well, down there.</p><p>No wonder she\u2019d been sore.</p><p>His shaft was far too large.</p> <p>He kicked away his breeches and smalls and simply stood there, relaxed, as if he often stood naked in a shaft of sunlight.</p><p>\u201cDo my looks please you, Mia?\u201d he asked, looking at her from under long eyelashes, as if he didn\u2019t know perfectly well that desire was pounding through her like a drum beat. Directing her to touch him, to squirm against him, to lure him to the bed . . .</p><p>She had to clear her throat. \u201cYou are presentable, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been told every day since you were a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes my moonbeam meet your expectations?\u201d The grin on his face said that he knew perfectly well that he was magnificent.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you ever going to forget about my stupid poem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said, his smile deepening. \u201cI\u2019m the only one of my friends who\u2019s had an ode written to his cock.\u201d</p><p>Mia groaned silently. There was no point in trying to school him in the art of literary metaphor.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to read your novels,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing about moonbeams in my work!\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to disrobe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I made clear, I am not at ease undressing in the daylight.\u201d She stepped closer, her hand drifting down his chest to his waist. \u201cIsn\u2019t this enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by half,\u201d he said. But he took her hand and put it on his hard length.</p><p>Her hand instinctively curled around his silky maleness. To her delight, he visibly shuddered, then cupped her face, and brushed his lips over hers.</p><p>She tightened her hand just a little. His eyes glazed over and a harsh sound came from between his lips. His hands slipped down to her jaw, guiding her face up to take her mouth.</p><p>In the back of her mind, Mia was losing her nerve. What if Vander no longer desired her, once her breasts had been freed from her corset? Even she felt distaste for her breasts, so why should he feel any different?</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you,\u201d Vander growled into her mouth, his hands gripping her bottom and pulling her against him. \u201cI want to hold those lush breasts of yours, bury my face in them, suck your pretty little nipples . . .\u201d</p><p>Oh dear God.</p><p>She would have to let him do it. Either that, or she could call the Four Nights rule into effect.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she asked desperately, \u201cPlease might we wait until tonight, when our room is dark?\u201d</p><p>He ground against her, a harsh noise breaking from his chest. \u201cDoes it feel to you as if I can bloody well wait until tonight?\u201d</p><p>Mia felt dizzy, as if she might faint. Perhaps she should get it over with? If she didn\u2019t look at his face, she wouldn\u2019t know how he felt. Would not knowing be better than knowing?</p><p>Yes. Unquestionably.</p><p>His nimble fingers were unbuttoning her gown in back, but he lost patience and ripped open the last few buttons. Mia numbly let him lift the gown over her arms and head.</p><p>He fell back a step. \u201cDuchess, the corset you wore the other evening was impressive, but I must say this one resembles nothing so much as a steel cage designed to contain wild tigers.\u201d</p><p>The corset employed a great deal of whale-bone to control her figure. It fell from her body and the laces\u2019 silver aglets tinkled as they hit the floor.</p><p>Then all that remained was her chemise.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>NOTES ON FLORA\u2019S NEW WARDROBE</p><p>Flora mortified to find seamstress views her as bony. \u201cThe Fripperies of Outward Appearance are unimportant,\u201d she informed the lady.</p><p>\u201cPas pour les hommes,\u201d the Frenchwoman said grimly, pins in her mouth obscuring her comment.</p><p>Flora knew no man of worth would take such foolishness into account. Still . . . \u201cCan you improve the bodice of this gown?\u201d she implored. The gown was made of white pleated muslin and left no doubt that Flora had very little in the way of feminine endowments.</p><p>The modiste mumbled something about sow\u2019s ears.</p><p>~ is this working? Probably not.</p><p>Interesting change, though.</p><p>Do men truly like bosoms?</p><p>It was taking all of Vander\u2019s control not to lunge at Mia, now that her corset had fallen away. His wife had turned white as a bleached stone and she was visibly trembling, but she undid the ribbon of her chemise. Closing her eyes momentarily, she pulled it down around her shoulders.</p><p>Vander restrained a groan. He felt desperate to touch her, like an animal in a duke\u2019s form.</p><p>The white chemise dropped away to reveal breasts that were more beautiful than he could have imagined: plump and smooth, with nipples like ripe cherries.</p><p>Mia gave a little wiggle and the chemise slid from her arms, was caught briefly on her hips, and fell to the floor. And there she was.</p><p>His wife.</p><p>His duchess.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d Vander said hoarsely, words deserting him.</p><p>Mia rolled her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to offer me such extravagant compliments.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are beautiful, Duchess.\u201d He could see her thinking about that, but he was in the grip of an overpowering lust and could not wait for his compliment to soothe her fear. He picked her up and lay her on the bed, coming down on his side next to her. \u201cMay I touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She meant it.</p><p>He ran a hand up her leg and straight to her sweetest spot. She was drenched, and a moan broke from her throat the moment he touched her.</p><p>Beside himself with desire, he rolled on top of her, reared back, and thrust inside. No preliminaries, no tender coaxing caresses\u2014just fast, sweaty motion that sent pleasure racing down his limbs, smoky and hot as burning grass.</p><p>He kept his hands away from her breasts because she hadn\u2019t given him permission, but somehow it was all the wilder for that.</p><p>Instead he braced his hands on the bed next to her shoulders and hung his head above her breasts. He could have sworn that her nipples puckered tighter every time he looked.</p><p>The bed board slammed into the wall. Over and over and over. And Mia was with him. She was caressing his body, her hands running down over his arse and curling around his thighs, urging him on.</p><p>He stilled. \u201cMay I touch your breasts now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it,\u201d he promised.</p><p>With a sudden movement, he rolled, and then she was on top of him.</p><p>Mia had been lost in delight, allowing Vander\u2019s hard body to pleasure her while she stroked and caressed and kissed what parts of him she could reach.</p><p>But as always when her breasts were involved, she snapped to cold attention. Glancing down, she saw that they were standing out from her torso like globes.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d Vander commanded.</p><p>Reluctantly, she did so. His expression was delirious . . . ecstatic.</p><p>\u201cYour breasts are perfect,\u201d he rasped. \u201cSoft, giving, your nipples like strawberries waiting for my mouth. I\u2019m not touching. But I mean to kiss them now.\u201d</p><p>Before she could stop him, Vander\u2019s mouth closed over her nipple, and Mia went straight from somewhat ashamed apprehension to a storm of sensation so acute that she involuntarily pulsed around his cock, making him groan aloud.</p><p>His big hands gripped her hips and pulled her down as he thrust up. Her hair fell around his face. With every suck to her nipples, the desperate, hot sensation inside her increased, as if she were a boiling pot on the verge of explosion.</p><p>All the time Vander told her in a hoarse voice what he was doing, what he thought about her nipples, about her breasts.</p><p>She believed him. And when she gave everything to him, her body jerking over and over, his in every sense of the word, the rightness of it echoed down to her soul.</p><p>She loved him.</p><p>She had never stopped loving him.</p><p>The pleasant affection that she and Edward had shared was not love. This mad, wild, consumption of each other\u2019s bodies, sweaty and real: this was love.</p> <p>\u201cVander,\u201d she cried, about to tell him.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t listening. He rolled again, and his strength and muscle and weight came down on top of her. His thrusts grew even fiercer; as he came, he shouted, the abandoned mad pleasure in his voice sending her body into another spiral, until she convulsed around him.</p><p>In that space of white-hot joy, there was no Vander and no Mia: they were one, panting, crying out, moving together in a primal dance as old as the earth itself.</p><p>It was blissful and raw.</p><p>When Vander withdrew, neither of them said a word. He pulled her close, and dazed, Mia tucked into his shoulder.</p><p>She had given him everything, ceded her body. And he had given his back to her.</p><p>They had consummated their marriage.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>From the Duchess of Pindar to her Publishers, Mssrs. Brandy, Bucknell &amp; Bendal</p><p>September 15, 1800</p><p>Dear Mr. Bucknell,</p><p>I have scarcely left my chamber for two days while reading Miss Julia Quiplet\u2019s three novels, and shall shortly begin Mrs. Lisa Klampas\u2019s novel.</p><p>I know this may sound as if my own writing has been neglected, and it has been neglected, but I assure you that the opposite is true. Miss Quiplet\u2019s books have been very inspiring, and even partly restored my faith in romance, and renewed my conviction that Love is the Secret Architecture of the world.</p><p>I will happily provide an endorsement of Miss Quiplet\u2019s next novel.</p><p>All best wishes,</p><p>Her Grace, the Duchess &amp; etc.</p><p>Two days later</p><p>Vander woke when the blue light of dawn crept through the window. For a moment he didn\u2019t know where he was, as if he had been thrown into a kaleidoscope, shaken and tumbled.</p><p>His body felt different.</p><p>Slowly he turned his head. Mia was curled against him, satiny hair falling over his arm. She was smiling in her sleep.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just his body that felt different: he felt different. He felt unbalanced. Vulnerable. Every night he became a madman, pounding into his wife, groaning, out of control.</p><p>Control had been the backbone of his life. A flicker of panic followed that thought. Perhaps his father lost his mind because of the fierce love he felt for the duchess, for the woman who cuckolded him.</p><p>No.</p><p>He could not forget what Chuffy had told him: His father had shown signs of madness even as a boy. And the former duke had abused his wife. What sort of love was that?</p><p>Gently he slid Mia\u2019s head from his shoulder and stood up. His blood had a slow thrum, as if he\u2019d never experienced pleasure before. As if the only thing worth doing in the world was kissing the woman in his bed.</p><p>Of course, he\u2019d felt this much pleasure before. At the moment he couldn\u2019t remember precisely an occasion, but there must have been other women who drove him into a frenzy of lust.</p><p>He pulled on clothing without bothering to bathe or to shave. Jafeer would make his debut appearance at the races in the afternoon, on a track only two hours from Rutherford Park, virtually next door to Starberry Court, Thorn\u2019s country house.</p><p>He had to retreat to the stables and recover whatever the hell it was he\u2019d lost last night. Part of his heart, maybe.</p><p>That was unacceptable.</p><p>He strode down the stairs, waving away Gaunt, except the man wouldn\u2019t be brushed off and trotted after him as he burst out the front door.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace!\u201d</p><p>Vander turned around with a growl. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to find out\u201d\u2014the butler bent over, gasping\u2014\u201cabout Her Grace\u2019s fianc\u00e9; do you remember?\u201d</p><p>Of course Vander remembered, though he\u2019d never mentioned the request to Mia. Why worry her with the idea that Sir Richard may have killed her beloved Edward?</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Gaunt said, holding his side. \u201cBlimey, Your Grace, you walk faster than a sow in heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Vander said, dismissing the subject of Edward Reeve from his mind. \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s been in prison!\u201d Gaunt said, raising his voice.</p><p>Vander froze. \u201cPrison? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld Tolbooth, Edinburgh! The Bow Street Runner only found him after the man organized a prison break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrumped-up charges,\u201d Vander surmised. No man would voluntarily leave Mia. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he\u2019d always known that.</p><p>Gaunt nodded. \u201cIndeed, that is so, Your Grace. The Runner will stand Crown\u2019s evidence that Sir Richard Magruder had Mr. Reeve sent to prison on a fallacious charge, under another name, without due recourse of law. Mr. Reeve almost died due to a head wound he suffered while being captured, and the charge will include attempted murder.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vander cursed under his breath.</p><p>\u201cIt seems that Mr. Reeve was transported to Old Tolbooth under a falsified order stating that he had been given a life sentence and that he was a recalcitrant, lawless criminal unsafe to keep in England.\u201d Gaunt sniffed. \u201cAs if Scottish prisons were any better than English ones. He was about to be transported to Botany Bay when he made his escape.\u201d</p><p>Naturally the man broke out of prison to return to Mia. To return to Charlie, too. Reeve had the right to both of them. Nausea broke over Vander, but he fought through it.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he now?\u201d he asked Gaunt.</p> <p>\u201cMr. Reeve is on his way here, Your Grace.\u201d Gaunt\u2019s face was agonized. \u201cTo see the duchess. Likely he\u2019ll arrive here tomorrow morning; the Runner sent a messenger ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Vander said. A strange calm had descended on him. Vander had one more day with her. One more night. \u201cNot a word to Her Grace.\u201d</p><p>Gaunt\u2019s brow creased.</p><p>\u201cI will not have her disappointed again, if the man doesn\u2019t appear,\u201d Vander said grimly. \u201cI will inform her myself, tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>He had felt like this before: at age nine, after his father supposedly mistook him for a burglar and knocked him into the scullery wall; again one year ago, when the High Constable arrived to report that his mother was dead. \u201cPrepare a bedchamber but tell no one the identity of our possible visitor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t plan to inform her until tomorrow morning?\u201d Gaunt asked.</p><p>If then.</p><p>The last thing Vander wanted to witness was the dawning joy on Mia\u2019s face when she learned that Reeve had never meant to jilt her or to abandon Charlie. That her beloved Edward adored them both, and had broken out of prison to return to them.</p><p>He himself would have broken out of the Tower of London to return to Mia.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied, as the truth slammed into him: he was as enthralled by her as his father had been with his mother. The late duke had died within days of the news of his duchess\u2019 death, as if the mere fact she was no longer in the world made him defenseless to pneumonia.</p><p>And yet his mother had been in love with another man. His wife, the current duchess, was also in love with another.</p> <p>In short, he had somehow managed to replicate the domestic m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois that had sent him to Eton reeling with rage.</p><p>Right, then.</p><p>He had one day left. One night. Suddenly, the irony of it struck him. Tonight would be his fourth night with Mia.</p><p>Fourth and final.</p><p>\u201cPlease inform the household that I shall escort her and Charlie to the Nestleford Races to see Jafeer run his debut. We will depart in an hour or so.\u201d</p><p>The butler nodded.</p><p>\u201cGaunt,\u201d Vander warned, \u201cI shall be extremely unhappy if even the slightest hint of this news were to reach Her Grace before tomorrow morning. Have I made myself clear?\u201d He thought he detected pity in Gaunt\u2019s eyes, but he didn\u2019t give a damn.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess will hear nothing from me, Your Grace. I would note, however, that there is a chance that Mr. Reeve will waste no time. He may arrive earlier than tomorrow morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe will not be here,\u201d Vander said. \u201cWe shall spend the night at Mr. Dautry\u2019s residence, Starberry Court, as it is close to the racecourse. As always, if guests arrive at Rutherford Park, make them comfortable until I return.\u201d</p><p>Gaunt nodded and Vander turned to go back upstairs. He wanted to prepare Jafeer, and a hundred other tasks awaited him in the stables as well.</p><p>But first, he wanted to wake Mia.</p><p>In his own way.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>The ducal household was not ready to leave for the races in an hour; at least, the duke and duchess were not, since they were still ensconced in their bedchamber and no one dared enter.</p><p>But a couple of hours later, the house and stables were bustling. Charlie was wild with excitement to see his first race. Dobbie\u2019s leash was tied to his crutch and the two of them were milling about in front of the house. Chuffy too had made it downstairs at an unwontedly early hour, resplendent in a gaudy saffron coat and fawn breeches.</p><p>Besides Jafeer, the Pindar Stables was running two geldings and a filly. Grooms ran hither and thither with arms full of the duke\u2019s colors; jockeys strode up and down, striking their thighs with their crops.</p><p>Mia could barely take it all in. Vander was the calm center of the storm: servants, grooms, jockeys swirled about him. For his part, Jafeer did some sidling and complaining, until Mia and Charlie joined him.</p><p>Mia leaned on his cart and Charlie actually climbed inside and sat back against the low wall to rest his leg. Jafeer settled down instantly and looked about with an alert, interested expression.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d Mulberry said, stopping briefly. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me a week ago, Your Grace, that Jafeer would tolerate a child near him, I\u2019d have said you were daft, begging your pardon.\u201d</p><p>Charlie had brought a small notebook with him, and was writing down everything he overheard about horses and racing, because\u2014as he had explained to Mia\u2014he meant to train the finest racehorses in all England someday. \u201cJust as the duke does!\u201d</p><p>As if answering Mulberry, Jafeer leaned down and snuffled Charlie\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cJafeer has adopted my nephew,\u201d Mia said with some pride.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Mulberry affirmed. \u201cYou and he are his herd.\u201d He leaned over and patted Jafeer\u2019s neck. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if he won his race this evening. He\u2019s got the heart for it now.\u201d</p><p>Jafeer\u2019s coat was shining and he looked like a king among horses, one who could race the wind.</p><p>Once they reached the Nestleford racecourse, Vander escorted Mia and Charlie to his special box\u2014which had its own footman\u2014and left them there. \u201cThorn and India will be along at some point,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Something was odd about Vander\u2019s manner, but Mia told herself it was probably nerves over the race. While he exhibited no obvious signs of apprehension, he had paid more for Jafeer than had ever been spent in England on a single horse. Of course he felt some tension.</p><p>Journalists from every newspaper in the kingdom including, of course, The Sporting News, were running up and down the racecourse. As far as she could tell, no one was speaking of anything but Jafeer. Chuffy and Charlie were leaning over the front of the box, eavesdropping enthusiastically on passersby.</p><p>Mia wore a new gown. Thankfully, her breasts were fairly well covered. She had a shawl as well, and between that and her strongest corset, she felt quite pretty.</p><p>Though, if she were honest, the gown was less responsible for her new-found confidence than were her husband\u2019s frank, heartfelt compliments over the past several days. Vander\u2019s remarks were nothing like the elegant phrases uttered by her hero, Frederic, but they had a raw sincerity to them.</p><p>She was smiling into her glass of champagne at one particularly vivid memory when the footman presented a calling card for Mr. Tobias Dautry. A moment later, he opened the door at the back of the box and announced\u2014quite as if he were in a drawing room\u2014\u201cMr. Dautry, Lady Xenobia India Dautry, Miss Dautry.\u201d</p><p>Mia put her glass down and rose to greet them. She had no idea that Thorn had a daughter, but sure enough he was ushering in a solemn-looking little girl with a book under one arm and a doll in the other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlie turned, and she saw him flinch when he realized that another child had entered the box. The limited contact he\u2019d had with children had invariably been unpleasant.</p><p>But he swung his way over and conducted himself with a courteousness that disguised his discomfort at meeting Rose. He even managed to bow without toppling, a skill that Vander must have taught him.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen Thorn or India since the wedding, but it felt very different to greet them now. She was still the woman who had blackmailed Vander into marriage, but she didn\u2019t feel like that woman any longer.</p><p>How could she, when he made love to her so passionately, and woke her this morning with the admission that he had been on his way to the stables when he realized he had overlooked something? It turned out what he had forgotten was a kiss\u2014and that kiss led to such tender, passionate intimacies that Mia had cried a little from pure joy afterward.</p> <p>Thorn and Chuffy took themselves off: Chuffy, to place his bets; and Thorn, to find Vander and check on Jafeer, promising to return for Mia if it seemed \u201cher\u201d stallion needed calming. Charlie hopped back to the front of the box, and Rose put down her book but not her doll and followed him. Lady Xenobia and Mia sat down and embarked on an awkward conversation about the children.</p><p>It turned out that India\u2014as she wished to be called\u2014was as nervous as Mia was about putting the two children together. \u201cRose has had very few encounters with people her age,\u201d she explained. \u201cShe had an unusual upbringing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie, too, has met very few children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he taking notes?\u201d</p><p>Mia smiled. \u201cVander suggested that Charlie could make himself useful by noting down any gossip he hears. Charlie has taken it more literally than Vander intended, perhaps, but it was a brilliant maneuver: Charlie hasn\u2019t been comfortable going into public, let alone in crowds, but he\u2019s forgotten about his wariness because he has been given a task.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI gather from my husband that Charlie is the reason you needed to marry Vander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mia hesitated and said, \u201cI suggested a temporary marriage, but the duke was reluctant to go through the bother of choosing another wife. So here I am.\u201d</p><p>India turned to her, eyebrow cocked. \u201cHis words?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are idiots,\u201d India said, sighing. \u201cYou do know that if Vander didn\u2019t wish to remain married to you, your marriage would be well on its way to dissolution, don\u2019t you? He wouldn\u2019t allow my husband to do anything to rescue him from your proposal, and believe me, Thorn would have found a way to stop the ceremony if Vander truly wished for him to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVander didn\u2019t want to lose his dukedom,\u201d Mia explained. \u201cActually, I think he cares far more about losing his horses than his title.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is probably true. His decision to buy Jafeer came after months of poring over bloodlines and the like, and I was the silent, bored observer to many of those discussions. But Thorn would have bought Vander\u2019s stables an hour after you made your demand, if Vander had decided to refuse you. For one pound or a thousand pounds, only to sell it back afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that,\u201d Mia said.</p><p>\u201cVander rejected every idea Thorn had, including outright destruction of the letter. Since then, he has refused to divorce you, or annul the marriage. What does that tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s honorable.\u201d The opposite of her father, to be blunt.</p><p>India burst out laughing. \u201cBelieve that if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no other explanation,\u201d Mia said primly. She decided to change the subject, and soon they were deep into talk of something far more interesting: India\u2019s talent for organizing and refurbishing households. After a few minutes, Mia couldn\u2019t resist, and found herself swearing India to silence and telling her all about Lucibella Delicosa.</p><p>It was an entirely satisfactory few hours, broken by a light luncheon with the children, who had become, if not fast friends, intrigued acquaintances. Mia had the feeling that on the way home they would both label the other \u201cquite odd\u201d\u2014but in an admiring way.</p><p>When the starting time neared for Jafeer\u2019s debut, Thorn and Vander returned to the box, but only briefly. To Charlie\u2019s huge excitement, Vander hoisted him on a shoulder, crutch and all. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you all after the race,\u201d he said, turning to the door.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to be close to the track,\u201d Charlie shouted, waving at Mia. His cheeks were rosy and his eyes shone.</p><p>\u201cI should like to accompany them,\u201d a quiet voice said.</p><p>India began, \u201cOh, dearest, I\u2019m afraid\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Thorn hoisted his daughter into the air. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to hang on tightly,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Off they went, two large beautiful men with children perched on their shoulders. It made Mia\u2019s heart clench to see them.</p><p>She and India moved to the front of the box in order to watch the race.</p><p>As it turned out, Mia missed seeing Jafeer sweep to an easy victory, because she was watching the man standing at the railing below her instead, and the boy leaning trustingly against his head as the two of them yelled and cheered.</p><p>By the time Vander and Thorn returned to the box with the children, Jafeer was well on his way to becoming the most notable stallion in England. Journalists had leapt into waiting carriages and were writing copy en route to London, describing in overheated prose the extraordinary purchase by the Duke of Pindar.</p><p>The stallion was already the favorite for the Derby. At this rate, he would earn back in purses the exorbitant amount His Grace had paid for him in no time. Vander\u2019s expression remained unchanged, but Mia could sense a deep satisfaction. For his part, Chuffy was downright exuberant: he had bet his entire allowance on Jafeer, despite the long odds, and he now had sufficient funds to back an archaeological expedition to the Andes Mountains.</p><p>\u201cThink of the material for your next novel!\u201d he crowed to Mia, waving his champagne in the air.</p><p>That evening at Starberry Court, they all drank a toast to the gamble Vander had taken in buying such a costly steed solely on the basis of his bloodlines. When they had drunk, Vander turned to Mia and raised his glass again.</p><p>\u201cWithout my wife\u2019s attention, Jafeer would be languishing in his stall, ribs showing. She is his family and his heart.\u201d</p><p>Mia smiled mistily at him.</p><p>After that, Vander broke all decorum, snatched her up from the table, and carried her upstairs. She did not protest, and their hosts only laughed.</p><p>Sometime later, Vander said, \u201cThis is our fourth night, Mia.\u201d</p><p>She had stopped thinking about contracts and nights, and the sentence struck fear in her heart. Her fingers curled to hold him more firmly to her. \u201cWill you deny me if I beg for more?\u201d she whispered, her voice hoarse from the pleasure he had coaxed and demanded from her.</p><p>He was silent a moment. \u201cI could never deny you if you beg me, Mia. Never.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Late the following morning, as the carriage neared Rutherford Park, Vander deliberately put aside all the passion of the night he and Mia shared.</p><p>That was over. His four nights were spent . . . used up.</p><p>As Mia\u2019s husband, he could demand more nights; he could refuse to let her see Edward Reeve. Some ferocious part of him that cared nothing for right or wrong wanted to lock her in his bedchamber. She was his, damn it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But another part couldn\u2019t ignore that Mia had made it clear, repeatedly, that she loved Reeve and had been heartbroken when he\u2019d left her at the altar. She had only requested a temporary marriage with him in a desperate bid to keep Charlie safe.</p><p>But Reeve hadn\u2019t jilted her after all. The man Mia loved had returned.</p><p>And Vander wasn\u2019t a man who could accept a woman who loved another.</p><p>By all rights, he should prepare Mia for the likelihood that her former fianc\u00e9 would be waiting when they reached home. He should explain to her that Reeve had never left her at the altar, and, what\u2019s more, had risked his life to return to her.</p> <p>But the ungovernable side of him\u2014the side that never had been a gentleman\u2014rejected the idea. Hell, maybe the man wouldn\u2019t arrive today. Maybe Vander would have another night with her.</p><p>They pulled up at the front entrance, footmen hurrying out to meet them. Leaving the carriage, he said merely, \u201cI shall settle Jafeer and the other horses in the stable, Duchess, and I\u2019ll be in the house directly.\u201d</p><p>A smile teased the corners of Mia\u2019s mouth, a reminder of their evening activities. Heat rushed through him, settling low. He nearly reached out and pulled her into his arms.</p><p>Instead, he turned and strode away with a muttered curse.</p><p>Vander reached the stables to find that Reeve had indeed arrived, several hours before. When the horses were once again safely in Mulberry\u2019s hands, he headed back to the house. Despite everything he knew to be true, a faint hope was beating a rhythm in his chest.</p> <p>But when Gaunt opened the drawing room door, Vander went cold at the sight of Mia sobbing in Edward Reeve\u2019s arms.</p><p>His wife\u2019s head was nestled against the man\u2019s chest, hands clenching his coat. Reeve\u2019s head was bent over Mia, and he was murmuring something, his arms tight, possessive, around her.</p><p>Every fiber in Vander rejected what he saw. Barely contained fury rode him hard; he scarcely controlled the impulse to kill the man touching his wife.</p><p>But there was the rub: she wasn\u2019t really his wife. He was no more than a temporary husband. A means to an end.</p><p>If there had been any doubt as to how he should proceed, the scene made up his mind. He, more than any man, knew that it was impossible to keep a woman who loved another man. Mia had loved her fianc\u00e9. Still loved him, as was clear from their tender reunion.</p><p>Reeve had been haunting their marriage from the beginning. Now here he was, back from the dead, having fought his way out of prison to return to the woman he loved. It was a romantic twist worthy of Lucibella Delicosa.</p> <p>Mia didn\u2019t notice when Vander entered the room, but Reeve\u2019s head came up and their eyes met. If Vander had bothered to imagine Mia\u2019s fianc\u00e9, he would have pictured a weedy academic, a spectacle-wearing professor stooped from too much reading and too little physical activity. A coward who had run from the reality of raising a disabled child.</p><p>Instead, Reeve was as large as Vander. His nose had recently been broken, which gave him the air of a boxer. Yet Thorn had described him as brilliant, and Reeve had the indefinable self-assurance of an Oxford professor, suggesting Thorn was right.</p><p>Reeve clearly caught the murderous look in Vander\u2019s eyes, and his own narrowed. They were the eyes of a man who had just broken out of a prison designed to hold the kingdom\u2019s most violent prisoners. This was a man who would fight to the death for his woman.</p><p>Hell, that was no surprise. Any man would fight for Mia.</p><p>She raised her head, putting one of her hands on Reeve\u2019s cheek. \u201cI simply cannot bear to think how much torment you have suffered,\u201d she said, her voice wavering. \u201cI feel terrible that I ever introduced you to Sir Richard! If it weren\u2019t for me, none of this would have happened.\u201d</p><p>Reeve murmured something inaudible, and Mia turned out of his arms, her hands falling to her sides. \u201cVander, you will not believe what has happened!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is Edward Reeve, who didn\u2019t jilt me after all. Charlie\u2019s despicable uncle threw him in prison on false charges, and he nearly lost his life.\u201d Another sob broke from her throat. \u201cHe almost died!\u201d</p><p>Vander moved forward the last few paces and bowed. \u201cReeve,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Reeve bowed after a calculated delay, just enough to turn his gesture into a challenge.</p> <p>Mia seemed oblivious to the battle of wills vibrating in the air between the two men. Her face was anguished, eyes full of tears. \u201cVander, this is horrible: Edward escaped from prison just as he was about to be sent to Botany Bay.\u201d She swallowed hard and tears spilled again. \u201cAnd it was all my fault!\u201d</p><p>It was Reeve who stated the obvious. \u201cThe fault is Sir Richard\u2019s, not yours, Mia.\u201d</p><p>Use of her first name was, to Vander\u2019s mind, a naked declaration of war.</p><p>\u201cYou could have lost an eye!\u201d Mia cried, reaching out to touch the black bruise that went down Reeve\u2019s face. \u201cTo think you might have died in prison, and no one would ever have known where you were.\u201d A sob escaped and she pressed a handkerchief to her mouth.</p><p>Watching her, Vander felt an icy calm move through his veins. He didn\u2019t want a wife who sobbed over another man\u2019s pain. She was his on paper, but her heart was Reeve\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI feel so awful that I didn\u2019t have faith in you!\u201d Mia gave Reeve a watery smile. \u201cYet the whole story is unbelievable. You must admit that it sounds like something from one of my novels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fully expect to see my adventures in a bookstore one day,\u201d Reeve said. He turned to Vander. \u201cMy parents\u2019 Runners are still on their way to India, hoping to find me there. I gather you know that it was your Runner who learned the truth. He had tracked me to Scotland and was trying to decide how to proceed when I escaped from prison. I am indebted to both of you, as he was very helpful in dispersing the guards on my trail.\u201d</p><p>Vander saw Mia\u2019s brows draw together, and uttered a silent curse.</p><p>\u201cVander\u2019s Runner?\u201d she said, her handkerchief falling to the floor. \u201cWhat on earth are you saying, Edward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hired a Bow Street Runner to find your fianc\u00e9,\u201d Vander said. \u201cI thought it unlikely that the man had voluntarily left you at the altar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d She gaped at him. He saw pink coming back into her cheeks. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d He could see horror dawning in her eyes. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t know before today that Edward had escaped from prison. That he hadn\u2019t abandoned me at the altar!\u201d</p><p>Judging from her brilliant eyes, her tension and grief had just transformed to a fury not unlike Vander\u2019s own. But before he could respond, Reeve took her shoulders and gently turned her to face him.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, darling,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here. I didn\u2019t leave you stranded. I will do everything it takes to make this right.\u201d</p><p>He looked over Mia\u2019s head. \u201cI knew, of course, about the provisions of John Carrington\u2019s will, and Mia has told me of the extreme measures she employed to force you to marry her. I owe you my gratitude.\u201d His jaw visibly clenched, and then he added, \u201cI have strong doubts about how long Charlie would have survived in Sir Richard\u2019s care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you intend to press charges against Sir Richard,\u201d Vander stated.</p><p>Reeve smiled, and any remaining hint of a well-polished professor evaporated. His hands dropped from Mia\u2019s shoulders, and his face took on the ferocious anticipation of a lion closing in on a kill. \u201cOf course. I mean to pay him a visit. But Mia came first.\u201d He took one of her hands in his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was a calculated gesture. The metaphorical gauntlet hit the pavement with a clatter.</p><p>Mia looked down at the fingers encircling her hand and then up at Reeve. Her lips parted.</p><p>Before she could speak, Reeve said, \u201cWe must expeditiously unravel the unfortunate circumstances that resulted from my abduction.\u201d</p><p>Vander watched, his jaw tight. But it wasn\u2019t his wife that he saw: it was his mother, gazing at Lord Carrington. That tableau put him in the position of his father, seething with impotent rage.</p> <p>\u201cI am confident it can be dealt with quickly,\u201d Vander confirmed, not letting on by a flicker of an eyelash that the only thing on his mind was murder. He refused to become his father.</p><p>He felt Mia\u2019s eyes on him. \u201cBut we\u2019re married,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Vander looked at her and blessedly, felt nothing. He had closed off that part of himself. \u201cAs you yourself have told me time and again, Duchess, a divorce can be arranged within six months.\u201d He kept his tone easy and reasonable.</p><p>\u201cEspecially in this situation, sweetheart,\u201d Reeve added. \u201cThe king himself will dissolve the marriage, if my father requests it. The earl is quite close to His Majesty.\u201d</p><p>Vander nodded. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll trust your connections to take care of this.\u201d He had had enough of the tender reunion. \u201cI doubt that you are carrying a child,\u201d he said to Mia. \u201cBarring that, I will raise no barrier to a dissolution.\u201d</p> <p>Mia pushed away from Reeve, taking a step toward Vander. \u201cThat\u2019s all you have to say?\u201d Her voice was rising.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his lips hardly moving. \u201cThe man you love has come back to you, Duchess. You were never jilted. You no longer have need of my protection or name.\u201d</p><p>She leapt forward, one of those small fists raised, and hit him squarely in the chest. \u201cWe are married! I. Am. Your. Duchess!\u201d</p><p>He had walked into the room to find his duchess in the arms of another man. The similarity to his parents\u2019 marriage brought on another tidal wave of anger that threatened to pull him under. \u201cBy vows that you begged me to annul,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, but after that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Duchess, you\u2019re getting what you wanted,\u201d he bit out. \u201cI\u2019m getting what I wanted. This was a mistake from the beginning, and you know it.\u201d</p> <p>She fell back a step. \u201cIt will be a scandal.\u201d</p><p>If he had hoped there was any chance that she meant more by her declaration that she was his duchess, that sentence disabused him of that notion. No woman wanted a scandal, any more than his mother had, but his mother\u2019s fears had come second to being with the man she loved. Still, his mother managed to remain a duchess and keep her lover.</p><p>He tightened his hand into a fist, forcing himself to speak calmly. \u201cIt may take a few years, but the scandal will settle down. You\u2019ll have Reeve, and I\u2019ll find another duchess. I\u2019m in no hurry.\u201d</p><p>She flinched. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, her eyes searching his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been together for only a few days,\u201d Reeve put in, \u201cso it\u2019s hardly a marriage. It isn\u2019t as if you\u2019ve shared much.\u201d</p><p>Mia gasped. Reeve\u2019s brow knitted at the sound, and Vander said nothing, just looked at him steadily. That\u2019s right, you bastard, he thought in some deep, primitive part of his brain. I had her first. She sobbed my name. I took her up against the stable wall and she begged for more.</p><p>But Vander\u2019s pulse of triumph evaporated like mist in the sun.</p><p>Reeve was taking everything that mattered. He had Mia\u2019s love. He had all her laughter and tenderness. All the courage that meant Mia had never feared him, as a duke or as a man. All the intelligence and creativity and passion that she poured into her novels. All the kindness that had made Chuffy and Jafeer fall promptly in love with her.</p> <p>Vander bowed and turned to summon Gaunt. He felt like a dead man as he walked across the room.</p><p>\u201cOne more thing,\u201d Mia said, from behind him.</p><p>Vander stilled, halfway to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou already knew that Edward did not jilt me, but you said nothing.\u201d Her words broke the silence like the sharp crack of a pistol. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me as soon as you learned the truth?\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened before he forced himself to relax. He turned to face her. \u201cI found out yesterday, but I wanted my fourth night, Duchess. I had paid for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou paid for it?\u201d she repeated slowly. \u201cI paid for those nights, or don\u2019t you remember your accusation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour nights was the charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour nights,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s all I was to you: four nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me into a hero, Duchess. You can have only one of those in a story, remember?\u201d</p><p>This time, when he walked to the door, no one called his name.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Perhaps all the tears Mia had shed in her short marriage had dried up the supply. Or perhaps there is a kind of grief too bitter for tears. She had been shredded by the world, torn into scraps, and tossed onto the toll road.</p><p>Mere scraps of humanity can\u2019t cry.</p><p>She departed Rutherford Park with her manuscript and a valise packed with Madame duBois\u2019s creations. She even left Charlie behind, reassuring him that she would send for him as soon as she possibly could. It would be different if she was traveling to Carrington House directly, but Edward didn\u2019t think it was advisable until Sir Richard was in custody. She couldn\u2019t confuse and upset Charlie by dragging him off to an inn with Edward, especially when Sir Richard was still a threat. Instead, she left Susan behind to take care of him.</p><p>For the first several minutes as their carriage bowled down the road, Mia stared silently out the window, trying in vain to harden herself. Her treacherous heart was screaming, demanding that she stop the carriage and return to Vander. Plead with him to keep her, seduce him if she had to . . .</p><p>Had she no pride? The man had taken his four nights and turned his back. Grief and rage were battling, but misery was threatening to win and pull her under when Edward leaned forward and put a hand on her knee.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in prison, Mia, but there hasn\u2019t been one hour as painful as that conversation with the duke. I\u2019m sorry it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVander just handed me off.\u201d Her voice caught and she took a deep breath. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even argue. I was no more to him than a wrongly addressed parcel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men do not give wedding vows the same weight as do women,\u201d Edward said carefully.</p><p>Mia felt as if a hole had opened up inside her, a well of pain that went back to her father\u2019s dismissive attitude and her brother\u2019s refusal to even consider her as an appropriate guardian to Charlie.</p><p>At the same time, her whole body ached at the idea of never seeing or touching Vander again. It was inconceivable. Impossible. He couldn\u2019t have really given her away.</p><p>But he had.</p><p>\u201cHe never asked what I thought,\u201d she said, her voice strained with pain. She hated the pity in Edward\u2019s eyes, so she added, \u201cWe only married a week or so ago, and he was beastly to me most of the time. I\u2019ll recover.\u201d It wasn\u2019t true. She\u2019d never recover.</p><p>\u201cYet he was the man for whom you wrote that poem. The poem you told me about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWere you glad when I didn\u2019t appear at the altar?\u201d His voice was as steady and calm as always.</p><p>Guilt ripped through her again. \u201cNo! Of course I wasn\u2019t! I loved\u2014I mean, I love you. It\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe result was that you married him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no choice,\u201d she cried, wrapping her arms around herself and choking back her tears. But wasn\u2019t he right? Hadn\u2019t she run straight to Vander, the first chance she got? Somehow, she could have found a gentleman to marry her. If worse came to worst, she could have married a total stranger, and bribed Sir Richard not to sue her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I was the reason you almost died,\u201d she added, shame tightening her throat. \u201cI feel terrible about what Sir Richard did to you. And I feel even worse that I didn\u2019t have more faith in you.\u201d</p> <p>Edward rose and moved across to sit next to her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. \u201cI find it surprising that the duke is willing to give you up.\u201d</p><p>His words made another tide of despair wash through her, but an errant part of her wanted to defend Vander. \u201cBefore I blackmailed him, he had never been forced to do anything against his will. He told me over and over that I didn\u2019t have the qualities he would choose in a wife.\u201d</p><p>Edward\u2019s arm tightened. \u201cHe\u2019s a fool. But you should know that the moment I make you mine, I will never give you up. I would never be so foolish as he.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and drew a breath, letting his words wash over her. They should have made her relieved. But all they gave her was greater despair.</p><p>Finally, she forced back more tears and looked up. \u201cThe truth is that I love him,\u201d she said, choking out the words.</p> <p>She felt Edward go rigid, but she hurried on. \u201cSo it\u2019s more accurate to say that I\u2019m the fool, because I knew what he thought about me. How he felt about me.\u201d</p><p>The truth was that a woman like her should never have looked at a rich and handsome duke.</p><p>The truth of it reeled through her mind. She wasn\u2019t violet-eyed and slender. She wasn\u2019t even very sweet, and no one had left her a secret inheritance.</p><p>None of this was Vander\u2019s fault. She had forced herself on him, and then she had made love to him\u2014but he had merely had intercourse with her. Four nights\u2019 worth.</p><p>And yet he had been so generous in bed. What other man would have pushed away his rage at being blackmailed, forgiven his wife for her criminal behavior, and consummated their marriage with such tenderness?</p><p>He was a good man, and he deserved far better than she. His next duchess might have violet eyes or not, but she should be as forgiving and generous as he was.</p> <p>Mia drew in a shuddering breath. She would get through this pain. It felt as keen as when her brother died, but that was ridiculous.</p><p>There was one thing that she had to make clear, though. She would not continue to make mistakes, and Charlie was safe from Sir Richard now.</p><p>\u201cI cannot marry you,\u201d she said, turning to face Edward. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m just . . . I\u2019m sorry for everything. I didn\u2019t know that I still loved Vander when we were betrothed, but after living with him, and being his wife, it wouldn\u2019t be right to marry you. Someday you\u2019ll find a woman who is much better than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d he asked, frowning at her.</p><p>\u201cA real lady,\u201d she explained, a shudder passing through her at the memory of her behavior in the stables with Vander. She forced some enthusiasm into her voice. \u201cSomeone beautiful and far more suited to you!\u201d Now she sounded like a barker trying to sell an undersized pig.</p><p>\u201cI never could get you to look at yourself in a glass,\u201d he said, shaking his head.</p><p>Mia looked down. It had turned out that Madame duBois\u2019s idea of a bodice was little more than a corset with a covering of tulle.</p><p>\u201cNot just your breasts,\u201d Edward said, in the detached tones of a scholar, \u201cthough those are damned beautiful. You are exquisite, Mia. Every part of you: your spirit, your laugh, your face, your body.\u201d</p> <p>Mia found herself turning rosy. \u201cYou never said anything like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a lot of time to think in prison.\u201d</p><p>She flinched at the thought of where he\u2019d been, and only managed a wobbly smile. Edward took both her hands in his and raised one of them to his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re well out of that marriage, Mia. Marry me, and we\u2019ll raise Charlie in a house full of books and children, and the kind of love that grows and deepens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds lovely.\u201d She managed a wobbly smile. \u201cThank you. But I can\u2019t marry you. I do love you, but\u2014but more like a brother, Edward.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened. \u201cIt may feel familial now, but I assure you that with time a different bond will grow between us.\u201d</p><p>Prison had changed Edward. He was more muscled, and he had a ferocious edge that she didn\u2019t remember. He used to look professorial. But even with a broken nose, he was a very good-looking man.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer me now,\u201d he said, before she could reply. \u201cThis is no time to make decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she answered. She was beginning to feel like a teakettle coming on to boil. It wasn\u2019t just tears bubbling up inside her. It was anger too.</p><p>Vander had said hurtful things during their marriage, but he had also said other things. He had made her feel beautiful. He had laughed at her jokes. He had not shown even the slightest distaste when he learned that she and Lucibella were one and the same; indeed, he had been fascinated in her writing.</p><p>Her father and brother had dismissed her novels. Edward had been supportive, but uninterested. Vander might have poked fun at her characters, but he had listened intently and made suggestions, though none of them were usable.</p><p>He had made her feel accomplished. Cherished.</p><p>But it was all a lie.</p><p>Edward leaned forward and brushed his lips over hers. Before she could stop him, the kiss deepened. Mia froze, letting it happen. She felt no reaction at all. None. Edward had broken out of prison, then returned to her\u2014and ungrateful wretch that she was, she felt nothing for him other than affection.</p><p>Mia used to think that love could come after a wedding. But her love for Edward would never be like a wildfire that ravaged everything in its path. It would never strip Mia of all her illusions about herself and the world, and throw her naked onto the ground. Turn her into a woman aflame with desire.</p><p>That would never happen to her again.</p><p>That\u2019s when the tears came.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>After Edward Reeve drove away with his duchess, Vander sent a message to Thorn, informing him of the man\u2019s miraculous reappearance. Then he rooted Charlie out of the nursery for another riding lesson.</p><p>He called him \u201cGimpy\u201d all afternoon, because his ward looked pale and shocked, though Charlie improved after Vander allowed him to trot Lancelot for the first time. Sometime later they groomed the horse together, and Vander showed him how to pick stones out of a horse\u2019s hoof.</p><p>One thing led to another, and they ended up in the blacksmith\u2019s shop on the estate. Charlie was not afraid of the pungent smoke or glowing coals, though Mia would have shrieked if she had seen her beloved boy\u2019s jacket smoldering from a flying spark.</p><p>Once Vander explained what he had in mind, the blacksmith took Charlie\u2019s crutch apart and inserted a small dagger while they watched. Mia probably wouldn\u2019t approve of that, either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On the way back, Vander hoisted Charlie onto his shoulder and the boy slung a thin arm around Vander\u2019s neck and chattered about horses and smithies all the way back up the hill. Charlie had decided that he would like to be a blacksmith. Vander didn\u2019t point out that a hereditary title and its estate could not be renounced in favor of a smithy. He was living proof that a member of the peerage need not restrict himself to lounging about ballrooms.</p><p>\u201cI could make crutches for people like me,\u201d Charlie told him.</p><p>\u201cFrom steel? They\u2019d make an awful racket on the cobblestones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wood isn\u2019t as strong. You could swing a steel crutch and take someone\u2019s head off,\u201d Charlie said, with relish. He was a boy, through and through.</p> <p>Even as Charlie happily nattered on, resolve was slowly growing in Vander\u2019s mind. Sir Richard Magruder had ruined his damned life, as surely as if he\u2019d swung a steel crutch at his head. And Vander meant to pay him a visit that very night.</p><p>\u201cAunt Mia says we\u2019re moving back to Carrington House,\u201d Charlie said, out of the blue. He was clutching Vander\u2019s hair to keep his balance.</p><p>\u201cYes. But you\u2019ll pay me frequent visits, as often as every day, if you\u2019re not at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d</p><p>Vander gave the legs dangling against his chest a squeeze. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Squinty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t squint!\u201d Charlie squealed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m preparing for when you do,\u201d Vander told him. \u201cLooking ahead.\u201d</p><p>Charlie gave his hair a tug. \u201cI want to live here, with you. I want to go to the stables every day.\u201d</p><p>Vander reached up, lifted him over his head, and set him down. Then he crouched down so they were at eye level. \u201cYou have to go away to school, Charlie. You\u2019ll be going to Eton with other boys. But you\u2019ll be luckier than they are, because you\u2019ll have two fathers: Mr. Reeve and me.\u201d</p><p>Charlie\u2019s mouth twitched.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man,\u201d Vander said, hating every word. \u201cYour Aunt Mia will be his wife. But never forget that your estate runs alongside my lands. We will see each other often, for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Charlie stepped forward and with the great simplicity of childhood, put his arms around Vander\u2019s neck. He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>And Vander didn\u2019t say anything either.</p><p>After a while, they continued on their way. They talked about how a blacksmith was the heart of a great estate. Charlie would need to know these things.</p><p>Vander had the feeling that professors didn\u2019t know how to run estates. Why should they? \u201cA good smith will say that a \u2018job well done is a job never seen again,\u2019\u201d he told Charlie, keeping an eye out to see if the boy was starting to flag from overdoing it. But his leg was visibly stronger, just in the last week.</p><p>They returned to the stables and stayed there until Thorn showed up, walking from his carriage with that loose-limbed ferocity of his. He didn\u2019t say a word about what had happened. Instead, the three of them got grubby washing down Jafeer, and ate roughly cut ham sandwiches with the grooms while discussing training schedules and other important things.</p><p>When Charlie had been dispatched to the care of Susan, Vander jerked his head at Thorn. \u201cSir Richard had Mia\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2014Reeve\u2014thrown in prison under false charges. He was about to be sent to Botany Bay when he escaped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReeve? Edward Reeve who made that paper machine I told you about?\u201d</p><p>Vander nodded.</p> <p>\u201cI never knew the name of your wife\u2019s betrothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my wife for long,\u201d Vander said, striding into the house. \u201cShe will be Reeve\u2019s wife, which is the way it should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d There was something guarded in Thorn\u2019s voice, but Vander ignored it.</p><p>\u201cSir Richard?\u201d Thorn asked, following him into his bedchamber.</p><p>Vander nodded. The time had come. He stripped, then donned a black shirt and close-fitting trousers that went to his ankles.</p><p>\u201cMy breeches and coat are dark, but my shirt won\u2019t do. Have you another black shirt?\u201d Thorn asked.</p><p>\u201cThis will be dangerous. Your wife is carrying a child.\u201d</p><p>Thorn\u2019s response to this was a curled lip, and after a moment Vander tossed him a shirt like the one he\u2019d put on. Then Thorn left to collect his matched pistols, left in his carriage, and Vander took his own Bennett &amp; Lacy pistols from the gun cabinet. They were overly embellished for his taste, with the ducal insignia picked out in silver, but their aim was true.</p><p>It would take approximately an hour to reach Sir Richard\u2019s estate, on the far side of the Carrington lands, if they went across country on swift horses. If there was one thing Vander\u2019s stables could supply, it was swift horses.</p><p>He had thought to take his usual mount, but as he walked down the central corridor of the stable, he heard a soft whicker. Jafeer\u2019s head appeared over his stall door. His eyes shone with lonely, surprised betrayal. Mia hadn\u2019t come to the stables before she left.</p><p>\u201cSaddle up Jafeer,\u201d Vander instructed Mulberry. \u201cAnd Ajax for Mr. Dautry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain about Jafeer, Your Grace?\u201d Mulberry had clearly appraised Vander\u2019s attire and guessed that something was afoot, not much of a leap, given the pistols tucked into Vander\u2019s belt. \u201cHe still tends to shy at the slightest thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Vander could see it in Jafeer\u2019s eyes. The horse had known love back in Arabia and lost her; he had known love here in England and lost her. He had won his first race. Jafeer had grown up.</p><p>A half hour later they were flying straight across Pindar fields, and Jafeer was responding to every touch of Vander\u2019s knees and hands as if he had been born with a man on his back.</p><p>The moon was rising by the time Vander slowed Jafeer to a walk, Thorn pulling up Ajax behind him. The horses were breathing heavily, but Jafeer\u2019s ears were twitching with delight and the willingness to gallop through the night.</p><p>They had reached the border of Sir Richard\u2019s land. They picked their way quietly through the surrounding wood, finally stopping at the edge of a long, rolling lawn.</p><p>Vander dismounted, tied Jafeer to a tree, and told him to be quiet. Thorn followed suit, and they melted into a clump of ash trees.</p><p>He had a shrewd notion that Sir Richard kept men on guard all night. He likely had enemies of every stripe. Sure enough, as Vander came closer, he saw that there was a man standing beneath the front portico, his outline just visible when the moon came out from behind a cloud.</p><p>Thorn touched his arm and nodded toward the shadow cast by a man leaning against the side of the house. There were likely at least two more guards inside the front door.</p><p>At that moment, the moon emerged fully from the clouds and Vander saw the cruel face of the man guarding the front door. He had the bone-chilling air of a man who would kill for a triviality, for a baked potato.</p><p>Vander gestured with his hand parallel to the ground, and Thorn nodded. Silently, slowly, they sank to a sitting position against a tree and waited for something to happen, something they could take advantage of.</p><p>For an hour or perhaps longer, the grounds were utterly silent. More clouds drifted by, causing the moon to be obscured more often than it shone. The man in front took a piss off the steps, but no one made a circuit of the house. In fact, neither man stirred, which Vander took to mean that Sir Richard wasn\u2019t worried about the house being broken into from the rear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, his threats entered straight through in the front door, likely because he defrauded men like Squire Bevington, an honorable gentleman who had no idea how to contend with a perfidious villain.</p><p>Vander\u2019s mouth curled in faint amusement. He and Thorn didn\u2019t qualify.</p><p>Thorn had grown up on the streets, and he had taught Vander a great deal. Vander had had all too many opportunities to practice those skills in the rough world of horse-racing, where a desperate owner could hire any number of thugs to take out the opposition by stealth or outright violence.</p><p>He touched Thorn\u2019s arm, and they rose and made their way silently up to the back of the house. Sure enough, no one appeared to be stationed there at all. Just as they were about to cross to the kitchen window, he saw an indistinct figure against the wall enclosing the kitchen gardens. It seemed Sir Richard had a guard in the rear of the house after all.</p> <p>As he and Thorn watched, the moon emerged from a cloud and shone directly\u2014on Reeve\u2019s face. Vander swore under his breath and they both stepped out of the shadows and walked over to him.</p><p>Reeve was wearing a tattered shirt, so shabby that Thorn guessed he\u2019d had it in prison, and leather breeches of the sort that blacksmiths wear.</p><p>A shiver went over Vander\u2019s skin, visceral hatred for the man who had taken Mia. His wife.</p><p>Bloody hell.</p><p>Reeve showed no surprise at their presence. Instead, he jerked his head at the dim light one story above their heads. Vander took the lead. He would have doubted that a professor had experience in breaking and entering, but Reeve slipped into the shadow of the house like a man trained to robbery from the cradle. Of course, this was child\u2019s play compared to breaking out of Scotland\u2019s most fortified prison.</p> <p>A kitchen window had been propped open to allow the heat of the ovens to escape the house. Vander pushed it farther open and put a leg over the sill. In a moment he had a hand clapped over the shoeblack\u2019s mouth.</p><p>Large eyes stared at him, more excited than afraid. Vander grabbed a cloth from the table and tied it around the boy\u2019s mouth.</p><p>For a brief moment they all stood silently, listening to the sounds of the great house breathing. There was a restless flow to the air. The master of the house was awake; Vander would bet on it. Likely Sir Richard had received word that Reeve had broken out of prison. Likely, too, he was planning to flee; only a fool would imagine no revenge would be taken, and whatever else he was, Sir Richard was no fool.</p><p>Thorn and Reeve followed Vander, low and close, down the servants\u2019 corridor leading to the baize door, which in turn led to the entry. There would be guards in the entry, trained for combat, but they wouldn\u2019t be expecting men to attack them from behind.</p><p>The three of them came through the door as one. There was a ferocious crack as Vander knocked a man to his knees, a bitten-off cry as Reeve took out another, and the sound of a brief struggle until Thorn dealt a third man a clout from the butt of his pistol. They were tying them up when a foot scraped outside; the man on the porch had heard the disturbance.</p><p>As the guard pushed open the front door, a flood of moonlight illuminated his coarse features and slack, thin lips. Sir Richard wasn\u2019t a man to do dirty work himself, so it was unsurprising to find that he\u2019d hired a man who looked capable of anything. Vander took him in a silent rush, knocking him out with one well-placed blow.</p> <p>At first Vander thought Reeve crossed to his side in order to help in tying up the guard, but instead he heard the sudden sound of a dagger leaving its sheath.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the devil are you doing?\u201d Vander growled, seizing Reeve\u2019s wrist.</p><p>Reeve\u2019s jaw hardened but he didn\u2019t resist Vander\u2019s grasp. \u201cHe shot two of my grooms, knocked me senseless, and threw me in prison. He kept me from my own damn wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet the authorities take care of him.\u201d Vander had occasionally taken the law in his own hands\u2014no one involved in the horse racing could avoid it\u2014but he had never watched a man being killed in cold blood and he didn\u2019t intend to now. \u201cThe price of murder is too high,\u201d he added.</p><p>Their eyes held a moment. Then Reeve snarled, \u201cHe gut-stabbed my thirteen-year-old post-boy. I was told last night that the boy lived a full day in excruciating agony before he died. He\u2019s a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn killing him, you risk becoming a monster yourself.\u201d When the truth of that had registered on Reeve\u2019s face, Vander let his arm go.</p><p>They drifted up the stairs as quietly as snowflakes, Vander thinking hard. He loathed Sir Richard Magruder, but Reeve was transported by rage, his body clearly burning with steely fire. Sir Richard\u2019s greed had cost Reeve the life of that boy, of his other servants, nearly cost Reeve his own life, not to mention his marriage.</p><p>That same greed had given Vander the best days of his life. It had given him Mia. Even though he\u2019d had her only a short time, it had been worth it. He fell back, ceding the other man\u2019s right to revenge.</p> <p>Whatever Reeve did to Sir Richard . . . he did.</p><p>By the time Vander reached the top stair, it was as if the shock of Reeve\u2019s return had evaporated. Instead, a new truth ploughed into him with a body-shuddering blow. For good or bad, despite the similarities with his father, he could not live without Mia.</p><p>She was his.</p><p>His woman, his wife.</p><p>He stood in the door of Sir Richard\u2019s study as Reeve swiftly and cold-bloodedly pummeled the man into submission.</p><p>Watching absent-mindedly, another fact hit Vander hard: something that had been there, but he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to look at. She was his life. In a few short days, she had worked her way into his soul, and for the first time in his life, everything had felt clean and true.</p><p>The hell with his past, with his parents\u2019 relationship. He refused to let her go without fighting for her.</p><p>If that aligned him with the tragedy of his father\u2019s marriage, the hell with it. He didn\u2019t give a damn. He had been a fool to walk away.</p><p>Vander left without bothering to say a word to Magruder. He no longer gave a damn about the man.</p><p>Mia was exasperating and fiery. She would likely disagree with him on a daily basis. She would court scandals, and ride with her eyes closed, and write stories in which men fell on their knees at the drop of a hat.</p><p>He would go to bed every night of his life hungry for her. And rise from that bed every morning satisfied.</p><p>All he had to do was make her realize that she was meant to be with him. He had to take her back, take her away from Reeve.</p><p>Make it clear to her that she loved him, and only him.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>By the time the coach arrived at the Queen\u2019s Minion, the inn closest to Sir Richard\u2019s property, Mia had wept herself to a standstill. Her heart burned in her chest and her throat was sore, but she had no more tears.</p><p>She climbed the stairs to her bedchamber, questions pounding through her head. Why was she never good enough? Her father, her brother, now Vander . . . she had been a charity case for all three: easily dismissed, insignificant. Her father never had much love to spare for his daughter; he had spent it all in his adulterous pursuit of the late duchess. Her brother was fond of her, but didn\u2019t trust her with his most prized possession, his son.</p><p>And Vander . . .</p><p>Vander had genuinely enjoyed her company, especially in bed. But he hadn\u2019t fallen in love with her. She had been just a female body, obtained for a few nights, used, tossed aside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Losing Vander wouldn\u2019t hurt so much if she hadn\u2019t believed\u2014truly believed\u2014that he was falling in love with her.</p><p>Though she might as well be honest, at least with herself.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t hurt so much if she hadn\u2019t cast and recast Vander in the role of hero. In Lucibella Delicosa\u2019s books, Vander always rode to his lady\u2019s rescue, and Vander always married a seamstress of low birth after love triumphed over every accident of fate\u2014and that would have included being short and round, had she created such a heroine.</p><p>A low, bitter laugh wrenched itself from her chest as she dropped into a chair.</p> <p>The real Vander hadn\u2019t even tried to convince her to stay.</p><p>She was a fool, who had to stop nurturing a dream of romantic love that didn\u2019t exist in real life. Vander was right: her father and his mother had engaged in a tawdry, sordid affaire that had tarnished everyone in their vicinity.</p><p>There was nothing honorable or beautiful about it. At best, it was pitiful, and at worst, it was contemptible. The years she had spent, putting her love for Vander into poetry or fiction? Equally pitiful.</p><p>And contemptible.</p><p>The most ironic point was that An Angel\u2019s Form still needed to be written, no matter how hollow and withered her heart felt. She had to support herself and Charlie when they were jaunting around Bavaria.</p> <p>She was washing her face when a footman delivered her valise and manuscript, along with a note from Edward apologizing because he would be unable to join Mia for supper.</p><p>Presumably he was planning some sort of offensive against Sir Richard. Mia couldn\u2019t bring herself to feel even a shred of concern for Charlie\u2019s uncle. Sir Richard deserved everything he got.</p><p>She ordered supper in her chamber and began reading through her manuscript as she ate, scratching out a line here or there. It was appalling to realize just how much her silly girlhood dreams formed the bedrock of the novel, never clearer than when Frederic\u2014on his knees\u2014vowed that he loved Flora because of her inner beauty.</p><p>For a few minutes Mia toyed with the idea of throwing the pages\u2014all her notes and chapters and fragments of dialogue\u2014into the fire.</p><p>But no.</p><p>She may have lost faith in love, but readers needed her novels, especially when they were sick at heart, desperate, nearing death, or watching a loved one fade.</p> <p>They needed to believe in the fairy tale that she no longer believed in herself.</p><p>After finishing her meal, she slapped the pages down on the desk in the corner of her bedchamber, trimmed the wick on the lamp, and got to work.</p><p>Frederic had to change. He was too mealy-mouthed, too passive. A few hours later the lamp guttered, and she rang for more oil. By then she had turned Frederic into a man who was big and strong and prone to telling Flora what to do\u2014although he loved her to the bottom of her dainty toes.</p><p>Rather than roaming English byways in search of Flora, growing thin and wan from hunger, Frederic went galloping after her, his greatcoat whipping behind him as he crouched over his magnificent midnight black steed. Or should it be a stallion?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t certain what the distinction was. Something young ladies were not supposed to know, she thought. She began compiling a list of vulgar words that she wanted defined. Stallion. Cock-pit. Lolpoop. Quim. She had a pretty good idea of what the last word meant, but she wanted to be certain. Love custard.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t there a dictionary of the vulgar tongue put together by someone named Grose? Obviously, she needed a copy so that she could create realistic characters.</p><p>She was searching her memory for more words banned to young ladies, when a leg suddenly appeared over her windowsill. Before she could make a sound, the leg was followed by the rest of Vander.</p><p>Mia jumped to her feet, dropping her quill. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded, low and fierce. He had thrown her out like yesterday\u2019s bathwater, and it was pure foolishness that the very sight of him set her heart thumping.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t answer for a moment, his eyes fixed on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she demanded again.</p><p>His gaze raked over her, heated, furious. \u201cA nightdress for Reeve?\u201d he growled, ignoring her question.</p><p>His words hit her with all the force of a slap. As if a passerby on the street had given her a blow to the chin or called her a whore. \u201cThe gown was for you, for my husband. I am not a woman who commits adultery.\u201d She meant to shout it, but her voice betrayed her, coming out ragged with distress.</p><p>She saw satisfaction flash in his eyes.</p><p>Madame duBois had made the nightgown from black silk, which clung to Mia\u2019s every curve. She usually wore white cotton trimmed with eyelet lace, so Vander did have a point.</p><p>\u201cI shall give you the name of the modiste, and you can order one for your next duchess,\u201d she replied, in a voice as chilly as she could make it.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no \u2018next duchess,\u2019\u201d Vander said, finally dragging his eyes from her body and stepping closer. \u201cYou are my duchess, my only duchess.\u201d</p><p>Before she could grasp what he was saying, Mia caught sight of a darkening bruise on his cheek and realized that his linen shirt had been sliced open by a blade. She gasped and took a step forward before stopping herself. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d He didn\u2019t appear injured; he was moving with the same graceful power that he always had. \u201cYou went to Sir Richard\u2019s house! What happened? Was Edward there?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened ominously at the last question, but she had never quailed before him, and she wasn\u2019t about to start now.</p><p>\u201cYes, he was.\u201d Vander spoke through gritted teeth. \u201cWhen I saw him last, Reeve was fine.\u201d</p><p>A sudden, horrific thought struck her. \u201cAre you here because something has happened to Charlie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Charlie rode all day and went to bed exhausted. I came to see you.\u201d</p><p>Mia took an unsteady breath. Right. Her panic drained away, replaced by a desperate wish to protect herself. She literally could not survive any more humiliation courtesy of the Duke of Pindar. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d she managed.</p><p>Vander pushed tumbled locks, dark with sweat, from his forehead. \u201cI won\u2019t give you up.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s heart bounded. Stay with Vander . . . live with him. Sleep in his bed, make love to him night after night.</p><p>The image snapped her back to herself. Where was her self-respect? Even the fact his ripped shirt revealed his muscled chest made her long for his touch. Something about him was destructive to her.</p><p>It was pitiful, she reminded herself, to want a man who was not only disrespectful, but unkind. As pitiful as all those novels she\u2019d written about one duke\u2014Vander\u2014though she\u2019d given him six different names.</p><p>\u201cHave you changed your mind so quickly?\u201d She tried for flippant. \u201cWill you change your mind again tomorrow? You never struck me as a fickle man.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cI am not fickle: in point of fact, I am Charlie\u2019s guardian and I don\u2019t intend to give him up.\u201d</p><p>Incredulity scorched down Mia\u2019s spine and she drew in a searing breath. \u201cYou want me to stay married to you because of Charlie?\u201d The mortification cut like a blade: it seemed that even her eight-year-old nephew was more valuable than she was. She had never felt more unlovable.</p><p>\u201cNot merely that,\u201d Vander bit out. Then something else flashed through his eyes. \u201cLook, regardless of what my mother did, my father never stopped loving her, all those years, even when he was in the asylum.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Somewhat to her relief, Mia discovered that fury was allowing her to view the scene from a distance, as if she had walked into a play.</p><p>\u201cI fail to see how that is pertinent to our marriage,\u201d she observed. \u201cIf our parents are to be the subject of conversation, I think it\u2019s far more relevant that when I described my father and your mother as loving one another, you countered with an assessment of my father as a bastard who seduced your mother, and moreover, you implied that I was more of the same. A bad apple from a bad tree.\u201d</p><p>Another moment of silence followed. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn so many words, you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said what you thought at that moment! You said things you believed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d The words burst out of him, as if the thread of his control had finally broken. \u201cMy whole life, I believed my father was betrayed by my mother,\u201d Vander said, taking another step toward her. \u201cBut then I learned he had been beating her.\u201d</p><p>Mia flinched. \u201cI had no idea. I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe injured her so badly that she was unable to have children after I was born.\u201d Something in Vander\u2019s voice told her that he had never said this aloud before, and might never say it again.</p> <p>\u201cThat is terrible,\u201d Mia said carefully. She had been right about all those glass animals. She would have to send someone over to Vander\u2019s house to box up all the fragile little mothers and their crystal offspring.</p><p>\u201cWhen Reeve arrived this morning, all I could think was that I had married a woman who loved another man, just as my mother did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took a final step and curled his hands around her upper arms. His eyes searched hers. \u201cI let you go. Bloody hell, I pushed you away because I was so convinced that you loved another man. But the minute your carriage was out of sight, it hit me. I was wrong. You don\u2019t love him, do you, Duchess? You love me.\u201d</p><p>Mia gasped and opened her mouth to hotly refute his statement\u2014but he bent his head and kissed her so ferociously that heat spread like wildfire over her skin. Only a slender instinct for self-preservation gave her the strength to pull away.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunate though your parents\u2019 history is, I\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t change our situation.\u201d She blurted out everything she\u2019d been thinking about all afternoon. \u201cYou and I are not a good match. We\u2019re too volatile and too\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t think of the word. \u201cI did things with you that no lady should do, and when you lose your temper, you say things I can\u2019t forgive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can change,\u201d Vander said, his eyes fierce.</p><p>Mia shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that. I lost my dignity when I blackmailed you into marriage, and I lost even more when . . . um . . . well, you know what I mean. If we remain married, over time I would lose what fragments of self-respect I have left.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s rough-hewn features were set hard. \u201cThere is nothing, and I repeat nothing, in what we did together that you should be embarrassed about. What we did together was a gift, Duchess. And I will have no other duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not tell me how to feel! Nor can you discard me and then demand to have me back, like a piece of lost luggage. What we shared is not good enough to sustain a marriage.\u201d She stepped to one side and pointed to the window. \u201cPlease leave the way you came in.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s eyes darkened and without answering, he pulled her back into his arms. Like a flash of lightning, that dangerous warmth spread through her again. When she opened her mouth to protest, he took possession.</p><p>Mia didn\u2019t regain sanity for long minutes, coming back to herself only to discover that she was shaking, clinging to her husband, her knees weak. Vander was swearing under his breath as his hands roamed over her body.</p><p>Once again she had succumbed to her basest impulses. She was shaming herself again. Ladies didn\u2019t act this way.</p><p>She pushed against his chest. \u201cYou must go,\u201d she said, her voice cracking. \u201cI cannot do this. You cannot do this to me. I deserve a husband who respects me!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI respect you,\u201d Vander stated.</p><p>The look in his eyes made her body throb with need. But she managed to clear her head. \u201cYou want me, which is not the same. You don\u2019t respect me, not the way a gentleman should respect the woman he marries. The heroes in my books would never say the things that you have said to me. They would never even think them. But you have. A minute ago you asked me if I\u2019d worn this nightdress for another man, even knowing our parents\u2019 history and the toll it took on both of us. You have repeatedly expressed your low opinion of me, no matter what you say now.\u201d</p><p>She stepped farther away from him, as though putting physical distance between them would somehow translate to loving him less. \u201cThe truth is that I am nothing more than the title to you\u2014the title, and a body to go with it.\u201d Anger once again began to shore up her courage, putting a layer of thick ice between them. \u201cAre you aware that in our short marriage, you have never once used my name? To you, I am always \u2018duchess\u2019; at one point I wasn\u2019t sure you even remembered my name. The final proof? Yesterday you and Edward renegotiated our marriage without bothering to ask me about my feelings\u2014though I stood between you in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstood. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of you even thought to inquire whether I would prefer to remain married to you, or marry Edward.\u201d</p><p>Vander couldn\u2019t bear the look in Mia\u2019s face: her expressive features were lifeless, all her joy and passion locked away so it didn\u2019t shine from her eyes.</p><p>His wife was standing before him, telling him to leave, but he would not leave. She was his. With that thought, he picked her up, ignoring her gasp, and carried her to the bed, following her down. The moment his body lay on hers, he felt an exquisite wave of relief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at home when I\u2019m with you,\u201d he muttered, kissing her nose, then her cheekbone. Other words eluded him, so he took her mouth.</p><p>And her body. When he slipped his hands between Mia\u2019s legs, she was already wet. After a second her eyes glazed over and she pulled him to her, so he slid into her tight warmth, mating with her like an animal, mad with the taste and the smell of her.</p><p>It was raw and magnificent, not slow and gentle. But after she had come three times, and he rolled, breathless, to the side, she still wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes. And when she sat up, his heart sank.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t right,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDuchess\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned like a flash. \u201cYou see? Even now, you don\u2019t use my name.\u201d</p><p>Vander hated her hard, frozen look. He sat up and took her face between his hands, as if he could warm her with his touch. \u201cMia, you are my duchess. It is the greatest gift I have to bestow. My name, my title, everything that\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Mia closed her eyes, opened them again. \u201cI need . . .\u201d She trailed off and began again. \u201cThat isn\u2019t enough. I need respect, Vander. You can\u2019t know how much I need it. I have to respect myself, and be respected. It\u2019s the one thing my family couldn\u2019t give me, and you do not feel it either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said, tempering his voice, keeping calm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She waited, but the right words didn\u2019t come to him. He could only think of crude words.</p><p>\u201cTo you, I\u2019m not someone worth loving,\u201d she finally said, with a sigh. \u201cNot that I can blame you. I wrote that appalling poem; I blackmailed you; I lose my head utterly when you touch me. I\u2019d rather . . . In time, I\u2019ll lose myself.\u201d</p><p>She got up without looking at him and put on a wrapper. \u201cGo now, Vander. Please.\u201d</p><p>Vander followed and swung her about, not gently. \u201cEverything you\u2019re saying is wrong. It\u2019s rubbish.\u201d</p> <p>She gave a crack of laughter. \u201cI suppose you do think that.\u201d She broke free, her chin in the air. At least she didn\u2019t look empty and wooden: now every part of her blazed with fire and determination.</p><p>\u201cMy feelings are not rubbish, Duke. Just because you do not agree does not mean that my feelings are invalid. In fact, you just confirmed what I already told you: at the heart, you think my opinions, my feelings, are unimportant. And if we remained married, your opinion would always come out in one way or another.\u201d</p><p>The pain in her voice made each word feel like a needle piercing his skin. \u201cI don\u2019t think that,\u201d he said, straining to explain to the fiery, rebellious woman whom he\u2019d hurt that\u2014that what? He had never had any use for eloquence; he had paid for his pleasures. But Mia deserved eloquence.</p><p>\u201cGo. Just leave me alone. Please.\u201d Her face and her voice were empty again, the charm and strength that everyone from Chuffy to Jafeer had responded to gone.</p><p>He tried one more time. \u201cI know your name, Mia, and I don\u2019t want to live without you. I love being married to you. You are mine, my wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am no man\u2019s possession!\u201d she flashed. \u201cI am my own person, Vander. Always. And I want a divorce.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her hard as he realized something. Mia was right.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respect her the way a storybook hero might. He didn\u2019t want to kneel and beg for her hand; he wanted to throw her on the bed again, and do all sorts of disrespectful things to her. He wanted to spend a lifetime arguing with her over anything and everything, giving up and kissing her until neither of them cared about their disagreement.</p><p>He wanted to possess her, eat her, fuck her, live with her, die with her. Put his seed into her and have children\u2014not because he needed an heir, but so that they created a child together.</p><p>So that someone with her eyes and her intelligence and her deep sweetness would always live in England, on his estate. So that future Pindar dukes would have some of her blood to counter the madness in his.</p><p>With a sharp nod, he turned to go.</p> <p>Only when he was back in his carriage, turning into the drive leading to Rutherford Park, did it occur to him, with a pulse of despair, that the saintly Frederic would never talk about \u201cputting his seed\u201d into Flora.</p><p>When it came to it, Frederic wouldn\u2019t want to fuck her either.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t romantic. That wasn\u2019t what Mia wanted.</p><p>There truly was no saving his marriage.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>The next morning, after a few short hours of sleep, Vander entered the breakfast room to find Thorn meditatively spreading preserves on a roll while reading a note from his wife. Thorn and India were constantly sending notes back and forth, via footman if Thorn was in his study and India in her sitting room a few paces away, or groom if he was in London and she in the country.</p><p>Vander contemplated sending a letter to Mia, but promptly discarded the idea. She was the writer, not he.</p><p>\u201cIndia is not pleased,\u201d Thorn remarked, looking up from his note.</p> <p>\u201cDid you tell her about your cracked rib?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cOnly the black eye. We\u2019re supposed to go to a royal drawing room next Monday, and a battered look leaves me at \u2018bastard\u2019 without reaching \u2018gentleman.\u2019\u201d He said it with distinct satisfaction. Thorn had grown up on the streets, and this morning, he looked as though he\u2019d never left them.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to go to a royal drawing room? It\u2019ll be bloody boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndia is rehabilitating me.\u201d</p><p>Vander snorted.</p><p>\u201cShe thrives in polite society, and I love her.\u201d</p><p>Thorn said that easily: as if his love were a fact of nature. Yet the very word made Vander feel stranded, as if he were on a small island encircled by rough waters.</p><p>For most of his life, he would have insisted that his father loved him dearly. But the duke had tried to kill him, multiple times, according to Chuffy.</p><p>Still, that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t love. He had loved his mother, even though he had cut her from his life. He had loved his father too, despite the tempests and violence he had conveniently forgotten. He loved Thorn. Chuffy. Charlie.</p><p>Mia.</p><p>He loved Mia. In fact, the truth was that talking about fucking her was just a way of saying that he wanted to be in her. The feeling that she was his . . . it was the same. A crude way of saying he loved her. A way of insisting that she could never be taken away from him.</p><p>He had the irrational conviction that she had taken all the broken, blackened parts inside him and mended them.</p><p>\u201cSo I am entering polite society,\u201d Thorn was saying, unaware that Vander\u2019s entire world had just turned upside down.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Vander asked through stiff lips. How was he to convince Mia of his feelings?</p><p>\u201cA knighthood. My father favors it, so I suspect it is inevitable.\u201d</p><p>Vander chewed a piece of ham that tasted like sawdust. He\u2019d no doubt that Thorn\u2019s prediction would be born out: the Duke of Villiers always got whatever he wanted.</p><p>He had to return to Mia. Kneel down if he had to. Tell her in the right words. Avoid saying things about bedding and owning her.</p><p>\u201cYou look like hell,\u201d Thorn observed. \u201cMay I take it that your wife is not inclined to return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to make her change her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it scarcely more than a week ago that you were incensed at being blackmailed?\u201d</p><p>Vander didn\u2019t bother to respond. For a while, there was only the clicking of cutlery as they demolished a great number of eggs, endless slices of beef and ham, and a mountain of rolls.</p><p>He had learned long ago that fashionable breakfasts sustained only those who spent the day moving languidly between carriage and sofa. He ate like a man with a mission, because he had one\u2014the most important one of his life.</p><p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t resemble you before I married,\u201d Thorn said, putting down his fork. \u201cThough I probably did. Are you certain that the duchess does not love Reeve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Vander said, sure of that now. \u201cBut she says I don\u2019t respect her.\u201d He suspected that when Mia talked about respect, she really meant love. And when he talked of his duchess, he meant the same. Love.</p><p>\u201cCan you point out to her that blackmail does not precisely\u2014\u201d Thorn broke off at Vander\u2019s scowl. \u201cOh, very well; I suppose commonsense is irrelevant. I\u2019ll take it as a given that you\u2019ve made a royal hash of it. That means you\u2019ll have to make a truly grand gesture.\u201d</p><p>Vander thought that over. What did he value above all else, apart from Mia? \u201cI could give her Jafeer,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI began to receive offers for him even before his first race was over. At present, he\u2019s the most coveted horse in all England.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want a horse, you idiot.\u201d</p><p>Chuffy rolled into the room and fell into a chair, looking the worse for wear. His hair resembled a graying bird\u2019s nest.</p><p>\u201cLads,\u201d he said blearily. \u201cDon\u2019t ever challenge the village baker to a game of darts. I didn\u2019t win a single game until an hour ago, and that was merely because I hold my ale better than he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVander must win back his wife,\u201d Thorn said, without greeting. \u201cHave you any ideas?\u201d</p> <p>Chuffy\u2019s head slowly sank down onto the table. \u201cNot sure it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>Vander\u2019s heart thumped. \u201cMia hates me that much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you don\u2019t measure up to a Lucibella hero.\u201d Chuffy\u2019s voice was muffled by the tablecloth.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t news to Vander, but Thorn frowned, clearly confused. \u201cMeasure up to a what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMia is an immensely popular novelist who publishes under another name, Lucibella Delicosa,\u201d Vander explained. \u201cMy uncle has read every one of her books.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNovels and Shakespeare. Not exactly your forte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that,\u201d Vander said grimly.</p><p>\u201cSo how does he fall short of a fictional hero?\u201d Thorn asked Chuffy.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t a poetic soul.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly the conclusion that Vander had come to.</p><p>\u201cKinross swears that he wouldn\u2019t be married except for some poem by John Donne,\u201d Thorn said. \u201cYou could always memorize a poem. Or\u201d\u2014he grimaced\u2014\u201cyou could try to write one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you referring to the Scottish duke?\u201d Vander asked. \u201cI have a very difficult time imagining Kinross reciting poetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me one night that he considers Donne responsible for the happiness in his marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoetry would be a start,\u201d Chuffy put in, straightening up, though he had the distinct look of someone who might pass out in the butter at any moment. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to it than that. At the climax of a Lucibella novel, the hero always does something heroic. In the one Mia is writing now, Frederic saves Flora from mortal peril.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrederic is an unmitigated ass,\u201d Vander said grimly. But he asked the obvious question anyway: \u201cHow does Frederic do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPresumably he saves her from the burning orphanage or something along those lines,\u201d Thorn said.</p><p>\u201cNo, a wild tiger,\u201d Chuffy said, stumbling to his feet. At some point during the night he\u2019d lost his cravat, and his waistcoat was both unbuttoned and inside out. \u201cI have to go to bed,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe tiger comes in at the end of the novel?\u201d Thorn asked.</p><p>\u201cFlora is fleeing the ghost-infested castle, but the villainous Lord Plum is enraged by her rejection of his unsavory advances\u2014even though he has a wife in the attic\u2014so he looses the half-starved, man-eating tiger he keeps in a cage in the castle courtyard.\u201d Chuffy rattled off the plot without pausing for breath.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the heroic part?\u201d Vander asked.</p><p>\u201cFrederic sees his beloved about to be eaten by the tiger, so he hurtles into the courtyard to distract the beast, and as the animal is racing toward him, the man draws out a bow and arrow and shoots it dead. I tried to convince Mia that a pistol would do better, but she thinks arrows are more romantic.\u201d</p><p>A moment of brief silence followed as Vander (and presumably Thorn) tried to imagine this singularly unlikely sequence of events.</p><p>Chuffy added defensively, \u201cIt sounds a bit melodramatic, but that\u2019s because the two of you don\u2019t understand the genre. I assure you that readers all over the kingdom will be shivering with terror during that scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s a scarcity of tigers in Berkshire,\u201d Thorn said, \u201cso Vander can\u2019t reproduce that thrilling denouement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn one of Mia\u2019s most popular books, Esmeralda, the villain leaps from a stallion onto the heroine\u2019s moving carriage, which ends up in the river,\u201d Chuffy said, looking more alert. \u201cThe hero\u2014that would be you, Vander\u2014dives into the black and icy waters in order to recover the heroine, reaching her at the very instant she starts to drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Vander said impatiently, coming to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWrite your own ending, Nevvy!\u201d Chuffy exclaimed. He thrust out a trembling but declamatory hand. \u201c\u2018The Duke, the Duchess, and the Orphan\u2019! To be sold in fine leather with a gold-stamped binding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should memorize some poetry,\u201d Thorn said, ignoring Chuffy. \u201cTry for someone less quoted than John Donne and you might even be able to pass it off as your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you really see me falling on my knees and reciting a poem?\u201d</p><p>Thorn and Chuffy looked at him, and Vander knew exactly what they saw: a burly man with no resemblance to a duke. At best his smile was wolfish; at worst it was downright menacing.</p><p>He had never read a Lucibella novel, but he had spent years listening to Chuffy recite breathless summaries of the plots of his favorite books. An idea began to take shape.</p><p>It would need Charlie.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>Mia rose at four in the morning and began writing, the words flowing out of her as if a river had been undammed. Flora was proving to have a surprisingly practical bent. After a few encounters with a spectral bride\u2014who had been drifting about the castle weeping ever since being jilted in 1217\u2014Flora had come around to the opinion that spending her life grieving for Frederic would be a waste.</p><p>By midday, Mia was missing Charlie so much that she decided to fetch him and move back to Carrington House, on the grounds that Sir Richard was surely no longer a threat. Once downstairs, the innkeeper informed her that Edward was waiting in their private dining room, where luncheon would be served in a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cGood day,\u201d she said, walking in the door.</p><p>Edward immediately stood, bowed, and kissed her hand. \u201cYou will be happy to know that a somewhat battered Sir Richard is now in custody of the justice of the peace, awaiting the Assizes,\u201d he said, guiding her to a seat.</p><p>A Lucibella heroine would feel horror at the mention of Sir Richard\u2019s condition, but Mia rather liked the idea that punishment had been served. \u201cI am glad to hear it,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI hope that you didn\u2019t suffer any damage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven those circumstances, I shall fetch Charlie immediately. I\u2019d like to re-establish us at Carrington House without delay.\u201d</p><p>A throb of misery shot through her at the very idea of walking in the door of Vander\u2019s house. But she had to be strong.</p><p>She was her own woman, she told herself for the hundredth time that morning. She was not just a title\u2014\u201cduchess\u201d or \u201cwife,\u201d or even \u201cdaughter\u201d or \u201csister.\u201d</p><p>She was Mia, and Lucibella too. And Charlie\u2019s mother. That would have to suffice.</p><p>After the meal, Edward went to settle accounts with the innkeeper, and she took herself out into the courtyard, tying on her bonnet as she walked. The moment she cleared the doorway, she heard a familiar whinny.</p><p>\u201cOh, for goodness\u2019 sake!\u201d she exclaimed, unable to stop herself from smiling as Jafeer pranced over to her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He looked tremendously pleased with himself. Before she could stop him, he caught her bonnet in his teeth and danced backward, shaking it as if he were playing a game. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although Jafeer was saddled, and his reins were draped around the pommel, there was no one in sight. \u201cWhere is Vander?\u201d she asked him, almost expecting the horse to answer.</p><p>Jafeer dropped the bonnet and came over. She stroked his nose as she looked around. The inn yard was deserted but for a carriage that stood on the far side of the yard, attended only by a slumbering coachman. Where were all the post-boys and grooms who generally lounged about, waiting for something to do? She narrowed her eyes. That snoring coachman had a distinct resemblance to Mulberry.</p><p>\u201cVander!\u201d she called.</p><p>Instead of her husband, she heard a peal of boyish laughter, and Charlie hopped from the open door of the carriage. Jafeer gave an approving whinny.</p> <p>\u201cDarling!\u201d She held out her arms. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Charlie swung himself across the cobblestones, his entire face alight. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to fetch you home!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201c\u2018We?\u2019 Is the duke with you?\u201d Mia asked, pushing back the thick curl that had fallen over Charlie\u2019s face and dropping a kiss on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI have to recite a poem,\u201d he said, giving her a tight hug. \u201cHis Grace and I wrote it together. I am going to declaim it, the way Roman orators used to do.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s breath caught when she saw Vander step from the carriage; then she looked quickly back at Charlie. He hopped up on the granite slab before the open door of the inn, and turned back to the open yard. With all the majesty of a young lord about to say something to Romans and countrymen, Charlie announced, \u201cRoses are red, violets are blue\u2014\u201d</p> <p>An arm suddenly emerged from the shadowed darkness behind Charlie and wound around his throat. Mia screamed as a bloodied, disheveled Sir Richard shoved Charlie forward.</p><p>He was holding her child tightly against him, a knife against Charlie\u2019s throat. The cultivated Elizabethan air that Sir Richard was so proud of had stripped clean away, leaving a predator with savage eyes.</p><p>From the corner of her eye she saw Vander take a careful step toward them. Mulberry suddenly showed himself to be wide awake and leapt from his seat.</p><p>\u201cSir Richard, what are you doing?\u201d she cried, hoping to draw his attention away from the men.</p><p>\u201cOh, merely thinking about killing a little gutter rat,\u201d he answered. Horribly, his voice still had the same cultivated tenor, as if he were speaking of tea and toast rather than murder.</p><p>Charlie\u2019s eyes were wide and fixed on her. \u201cAunt Mia,\u201d he said faintly. Another scream bubbled up in her chest, but she managed to choke it down.</p> <p>\u201cSurely murder is an extreme solution?\u201d Vander asked. He now stood at Mia\u2019s side. Mulberry was silently circling the yard so he could approach from the rear.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s responsible for all of it,\u201d Sir Richard snarled. \u201cI have to leave the bloody country and it\u2019s all the fault of this crippled little dunce, who should have been drowned at birth.\u201d He gave Charlie a vicious shake and the knife came dangerously close to the child\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Mia stumbled forward. \u201cI am responsible. It\u2019s my fault. Please, let Charlie go.\u201d</p><p>In answer to her movement, Sir Richard wrenched the child\u2019s head farther back, placing the shining edge of the knife blade just under his chin. She heard Charlie\u2019s crutch strike the cobblestones, though she didn\u2019t dare take her eyes from Sir Richard\u2019s face.</p><p>There had been more behind Sir Richard\u2019s perpetual, ferocious lawsuits than she had realized. He was cracked, utterly mad.</p><p>\u201cWhy Charlie?\u201d she croaked. \u201cPlease! He\u2019s your nephew! He doesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Vander barked.</p><p>To Mia\u2019s utter shock, Charlie\u2019s right arm darted up and back, and he stuck a little dagger into Sir Richard\u2019s arm. He probably didn\u2019t manage to do more than prick him, but Sir Richard\u2019s knife wavered, which gave Vander the second he needed: he exploded forward and wrenched Charlie free, spinning him away.</p> <p>Sir Richard let out an enraged bellow, and lunged after them, knocking Mia to the ground. Charlie was already safely behind Vander, whose air of a savage warrior, ready to protect his family by ripping an enemy limb from limb, caused Sir Richard to freeze in his tracks.</p><p>Then, just as Mulberry sprang forward, Sir Richard veered left, grabbed Jafeer\u2019s pommel, vaulted into the saddle, and sent the stallion galloping out of the inn yard. With a curse, Mulberry charged through the gate after him.</p><p>For an instant none of them moved or spoke. Then: \u201cHe stole Jafeer!\u201d Charlie shouted indignantly.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t have him long,\u201d Vander said calmly. With one huge stride, he reached Mia and pulled her up and into his arms.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bring herself to speak; she just leaned against his chest, eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Jafeer,\u201d she heard Vander say above her head. Had he dropped a kiss on her hair? \u201cSir Richard will sell him when he reaches the coast, but I\u2019ll offer a reward that will have every man in England looking for him.\u201d</p><p>Boots sounded on the cobblestones, and a disgruntled voice growled, \u201cI hope to hell that wasn\u2019t Sir Richard Magruder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlie is too young to hear that sort of language,\u201d Mia said, opening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI apologize.\u201d Edward was looking with narrowed eyes at Vander\u2019s arms around her.</p><p>\u201cSir Richard has the justice of the peace for Berkshire in his pocket,\u201d Vander said. \u201cAlthough that does not explain why he knew we could be found here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect that he was looking for me,\u201d Edward said. \u201cHe made a number of threats against me last night. After he was in custody, I told the sheriff that I would be staying here in case I was needed to testify.\u201d</p><p>Mulberry came back into the yard. \u201cHe\u2019s taken the road toward Dover,\u201d he said, panting. \u201cTrying to get to France, I expect.\u201d</p><p>Vander nodded and turned to Edward. \u201cIf you will forgive me, Mr. Reeve, I should like to take my wife for a short drive.\u201d</p><p>The courtyard was silent for a long second.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Edward said. His voice was expressionless, but his eyes were bleak. \u201cCharlie, old man, why don\u2019t you come inside with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see what I did?\u201d Charlie demanded. \u201cThe way I stabbed Sir Richard?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem in the least shaken by the experience.</p><p>Vander moved away from Mia, picking up Charlie\u2019s crutch, which had apparently fallen in two pieces. She watched numbly as he screwed a little dagger into the crutch, where there had been no dagger before.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds as if you saved yourself,\u201d Edward told Charlie.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he replied cheerfully, \u201cthe duke saved me. But I stabbed Sir Richard!\u201d He took his crutch from Vander, stuck it under his arm, and started toward the inn door. Then he turned back. \u201cYou are coming back, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, the faintest quaver in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWithin the hour,\u201d Vander promised. That seemed enough for the boy. He swung away with Edward, the story tumbling out all over again.</p><p>\u201cSir Richard was about to kill Charlie,\u201d Mia moaned, swaying where she stood. \u201cNo, he couldn\u2019t have meant it! He is Charlie\u2019s uncle, his own blood relative!\u201d</p><p>Vander picked her up and strode across the courtyard toward his carriage. Mia should have struggled. In a few minutes, she would definitely assert herself and become her own woman as she had planned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But right now she was trembling from head to foot, and it felt wonderful to be held by a man of strength, a warrior who had protected her and her child.</p><p>\u201cSir Richard is mad,\u201d Vander said, seating himself in the corner of the carriage and pulling her onto his lap, \u201cand he may well have meant his threat. Apparently, my father posed a danger to me. I have no memory of it, but Chuffy says the duke periodically tried to reach the nursery, and they had to put footmen on the door day and night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful!\u201d Mia choked. \u201cThank goodness your father didn\u2019t manage to injure you! I\u2019m sure it would have broken his heart.\u201d Something in his eyes made her add firmly, \u201cAnd thank goodness you didn\u2019t inherit his condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI inherited his temper,\u201d Vander said flatly, thumping the roof to tell Mulberry that they were ready. \u201cI used to break furniture, but these days the worst I do is occasionally engage in fisticuffs with Thorn.\u201d</p> <p>The image of two beautiful men grappling with each other came to Mia but she pushed it away. \u201cYou would never injure someone in a rage,\u201d she replied with utter certainty. She leaned her cheek against the crook of his shoulder, soaking in his strength.</p><p>\u201cBut I do say things that I don\u2019t mean. I\u2019ve been a bastard to you, Mia,\u201d Vander said, pulling away just enough so that their eyes met. \u201cYou\u2019re the most beautiful, intelligent woman I\u2019ve ever met, and I have hurt your feelings. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The words were gruff, with an edge of ferocity.</p><p>She knew instinctively that Vander had never spoken words like this before. Mia swallowed hard. How could she reject him? But she had to.</p><p>\u201cAfter I make love to you,\u201d Vander said, bringing one of her palms to his lips, \u201cthe only thing in my head is the desire to be inside you again, any way I can.\u201d</p><p>This was the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. It was what she\u2019d dreamed of\u2014but not in the right way. The aching tone in her voice was humiliating, and he remained silent, so she kept talking to fill the charged air. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d Tears pricked her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t just be a woman in your bed.\u201d</p> <p>Vander\u2019s voice sounded like a rusty gate. \u201cMy love for you has nothing to do with my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Mia gasped.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t loved many people, and I\u2019m not very good at it. I loved my father, but he tried to kill me several times. I loved my mother, but I was caught between my parents, so I always felt as if I was betraying my father by being civil to her.\u201d</p><p>He paused, his eyes searching hers. \u201cI love Thorn. I love India. Chuffy, of course. Charlie. And you. You most of all, Mia.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s mind reeled. \u201cBut you said things that hurt me.\u201d That sounded like a petulant child. \u201cYou always called me \u2018Duchess,\u2019 as if I were merely the role, not the person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I call you my duchess, I meant that you were mine to love, to hold, to make love to. That means\u2014 That means everything to me.\u201d She could hear the deep truth in his words. \u201cDo you love me, Mia? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll walk away and I won\u2019t bother you again. I promise you that.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart pounded as indecision swept through her.</p><p>\u201cBut if you do love me,\u201d he said, his hands tightening on hers, \u201cI\u2019ll never let you go. Not until the end of our lives. Not if Reeve writes you a hundred love poems and says all the things I can\u2019t. Not if that blasted Frederic himself shows up. Do you understand?\u201d His eyes burned into hers.</p><p>Biting her lip, she looked away. \u201cIt\u2019s not just\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hand cupped her cheek and gently turned her back to him. \u201cThere\u2019s only one important question, Mia. Do you love me?\u201d</p><p>The words were a demand, yes, but she heard a trace of vulnerability as well, as if she were seeing deep inside him, a part of him that he had rarely if ever shown anyone. She couldn\u2019t lie to him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said huskily. \u201cI do love you, Vander. I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he said, low and rough, pulling her close and burying his face in her hair. \u201cI\u2019ve been such a fool. Tell me that you will never leave me.\u201d His voice was raw with emotion, as if the ferocious warrior had finally been brought to his knees.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d The word felt as right as sunshine, as right as Charlie\u2019s smile. \u201cI love you,\u201d Mia told him again. \u201cAlways.\u201d What had seemed shameful was now a simple fact. \u201cIn fact, I have loved you since we were both fifteen years old, if you want the truth of it. Perhaps even before that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t deserve you,\u201d Vander said, pulling back, under control once more. \u201cBut I have this.\u201d He reached into his coat pocket, and brought out a handful of yellowed and torn scraps of paper.</p><p>The handwriting on them wasn\u2019t elegant, but it was earnest.</p><p>It was her handwriting.</p><p>\u201cI fancied you back then,\u201d Vander said, spilling the poem into her hands. \u201cMostly your breasts, but I liked your laugh, and the way you made me less angry even if your father was in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Mia breathed.</p><p>\u201cOne of the worst things that can happen to a boy is to be mocked. I had had so much of it in school that by fifteen I had a very thin skin. After Rotter came in the library that day, I couldn\u2019t think straight. He said he was going to tell everyone. You would have been ruined, so I said the only thing I could think of to make him stop. Of course, it made everything worse.\u201d</p><p>Mia stared down at the scraps of paper. \u201cYou kept my poem all these years?\u201d</p><p>Vander nodded. \u201cI\u2019d be damned if I would let my poem\u2014the only poem anyone would ever write for me\u2014be swept up like rubbish. So I took it.\u201d</p><p>Mia\u2019s smile was so large that it felt as if her face might crack. \u201cWhere has it been, all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put it in a box, and there it stayed. Until Thorn said I should make a grand gesture, and write a poem. Charlie helped me, but we both knew our verse was a failure. Then I thought of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth did you come up with the idea of wooing me with poetry?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help giggling. The smile in her heart couldn\u2019t be kept down.</p><p>\u201cI was desperate,\u201d he said simply. \u201cBut I have another plan in reserve as well, in case verse isn\u2019t persuasive enough.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d He handed her a letter. It was stamped and sealed and looked entirely ducal.</p><p>Mia crooked an eyebrow at him, and then broke it open. She read it once. Three times. \u201cYou\u2019re blackmailing me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf you leave me, I will send that letter to The Times. The entire world will know Lucibella Delicosa\u2019s real name. Everyone from the king to the littlest scullery maid reading by the kitchen fire.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and let the letter fall.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I want most?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI will give you anything I own, Mia. Anything you desire.\u201d</p><p>He meant it.</p><p>\u201cA kiss,\u201d she breathed.</p><p>Vander surged forward, taking her mouth as he pushed her backward onto the carriage seat. His body felt wonderful on hers, and her blood sang with the pleasure of it, so much so that tears came to her eyes. Her arms curled around Vander as if her life depended on it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he told her again, just as one of his hands slid down and cupped her breast. Madame duBois\u2019s bodice gave way and Mia\u2019s breast spilled into his hand.</p><p>Vander bent his head and took her right nipple in his mouth. It felt so good that Mia whimpered, and her body went liquid, boneless. One of his hands had pulled up her skirts and was roaming, leaving quaking trails of fire, coming closer to where she most wanted him to be.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>A moan broke from Mia\u2019s throat. \u201cTake me, then,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m yours, Vander.\u201d</p> <p>He stilled. \u201cSay that again.\u201d</p><p>His eyes had changed from tenderness to something infinitely wilder. Still, he hesitated. \u201cI do want you, Mia, but mostly I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have me,\u201d she said, giddy with the joy of it.</p><p>\u201cForever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p> <p>There in the carriage, on a too-narrow seat, Vander came to her in heat and love and laughter. He came to her with respect and adoration.</p><p>After a while, things had become hot and sweaty. Mia\u2019s tangled hair was spilling onto the dirty floor. She was sweating behind her knees and other places too. She was gasping because Vander kept taking her mouth again, as if he could never have enough of her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014not again. I\u2014\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cCome, Mia,\u201d his voice was raw again. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>A POEM WRITTEN BY THE DUKE OF PINDAR, WITH THE INVALUABLE AID OF MASTER CHARLES WALLACE CARRINGTON</p> <p>Roses are Red, Violets are Blue.</p><p>Your duke respects you, and he loves you too.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>The following morning, Gaunt had a terrible shock when he opened the front door: Jafeer was grazing on the front lawn below Mia\u2019s bedchamber window, riderless, his reins trailing.</p><p>Later that day, the sheriff paid a visit, reporting that Sir Richard Magruder, who had been erroneously released from custody, had stolen a horse, and was a fugitive from justice, had been thrown into a ditch in the midst of his flight, and had died instantly of a broken neck.</p><p>Jafeer, it seemed, had not enjoyed having Sir Richard on his back.</p><p>In fact, he much preferred his own herd; as long as his family was near, Jafeer was the most amenable of animals. In the year that followed, he went on many a painfully slow walk, during which he pranced around Lancelot and Mia. Yet no matter how ardently Jafeer courted her, Mia adamantly refused to ride a horse that size.</p><p>The following spring Her Grace changed her story, announcing that she didn\u2019t want to risk her unborn babe by riding a mount more energetic than Lancelot.</p> <p>Two years after that, she declared that Flora became very irritable if separated from her mother for long periods, and so she meant to bring her on her daily ride. No one would trust Flora\u2014who had her father\u2019s tumbling black hair and her mother\u2019s laugh\u2014to a horse other than Lancelot.</p><p>Flora was followed in rapid order by Cuthbert (named after a beloved great-uncle) and by Edward (named after a special friend of his mother\u2019s); thus the Duchess of Pindar successfully avoided being thrust onto a monstrously tall horse for a long time.</p><p>By that point, Jafeer had won every race there was to win in all Great Britain, and he\u2019d retired to stand at stud, a task which he took to with great enthusiasm.</p><p>Then, early one morning as the duke and duchess were lying about in bed after behaving in a fashion that would have shocked their nearest and dearest, His Grace pointed out that Lancelot was growing elderly, and probably would be happiest remaining in the stable.</p><p>Since anyone in the world could tell that Lancelot would, indeed, be happy never to leave his stall again, the duchess offered no counter argument. His Grace added that Jafeer wasn\u2019t terribly tall, and besides, all three of their offspring were dashing around on horses twice the height of the duchess.</p><p>Mia was draped halfway across her husband, tracing circles on his chest with one finger. \u201cI simply can\u2019t believe the children all turned out to be such giants,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cThey were tiny babies, and now look at them.\u201d</p><p>Vander kissed her forehead. \u201cThey have your beauty and my height.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know, I think Bertie might become a novelist? He told me a story about something that happened at Eton with a perfect sense of timing.\u201d</p><p>Later that morning, Vander helped his wife onto Jafeer\u2019s back, much to Mulberry\u2019s astonishment. Though Mia showed a lamentable tendency to cling to the pommel and close her eyes\u2014and Vander felt very strongly that all riders should keep their eyes open\u2014they finally ambled down the path that led through the wood.</p><p>After that, there was never another horse for Mia.</p><p>If Mia had spent a great deal of energy avoiding Arabians, the same could not be said for Charlie. Just as Vander had predicted, Charlie quickly became the finest equestrian in five counties. He was fearless on the back of a horse, and could handle the most intractable of stallions.</p><p>At Eton, he had special permission to miss classes for various races, which at first caused not a little envy. But once the other boys came to understand that as long as young Lord Carrington rode for the equestrian team, Eton would not lose the Steeplechase Cup\u2014a silver goblet that had been traded back and forth between Eton and Harrow for years\u2014well, after that, no one begrudged him the missed classes or ever dared to call his lordship \u201cLimpy\u201d or \u201cPeg-Legged Pete.\u201d</p><p>In fact, as Mia confided to her editor, Mr. William Bucknell\u2014who had ceased to be Mr. Bucknell and become simply \u201cWill\u201d a few years before\u2014it was as if her nephew had taken one look at the duke and decided to become Vander.</p><p>\u201cCharlie has grown so muscled wrestling half-trained horses that he even looks like my husband; no woman notices his limp,\u201d Mia said. \u201cAnd he talks like Vander as well. By all accounts, Miss Alicia Gretly, who is pretty enough to be one of my own heroines, is pining away for love of my nephew. But when I mentioned it to him, Charlie winced and said that when he took a wife he planned to chase her, rather than the other way around.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cPrecisely what Vander would have said at that age!\u201d</p><p>Will Bucknell couldn\u2019t help laughing. It was the first day of his annual monthly visit to Rutherford Park, during which he edited the duchess\u2019 latest manuscript; that month was invariably the happiest of his year. \u201cIf he follows His Grace\u2019s pattern, Lord Carrington has a good ten years in which to find the right woman,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like only yesterday that he was a tiny boy, hopping around with his crutch,\u201d the duchess said with a sigh, picking up her quill. \u201cI suppose we ought to start working; we\u2019ve been gossiping for at least an hour.\u201d</p><p>Before Will could reply, the duke poked his head in the door. \u201cMight I lure my wife away for a brief consultation on a matter of grave importance?\u201d</p><p>Will watched with some interest. In his opinion, one of the reasons why the duchess\u2019 novels were being compared, in some circles, with Miss Jane Austen\u2019s, was because she took the joy that was so evident in her private life and shared some of it with her readers.</p><p>But Her Grace was shaking her head. \u201cOff with you,\u201d she told her husband, blowing him a kiss. \u201cNo consultations until Will and I have finished at least ten pages.\u201d</p><p>After the duke closed the door behind him, Her Grace turned back with a wide, impish smile. \u201cDid you see how peaceably he left? If you can believe it, my husband used to think that he could always get his way. It took me at least a year of marriage to disabuse him of that notion.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Will couldn\u2019t think of an appropriate response, so he tapped the pile of manuscript pages that lay before him. \u201cI suggest that before we look closely at any given scene, we discuss the fact that your hero, Lord Xavier Hawtrey, loses his memory after being thrown from a horse and no longer remembers his own wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy readers will love it,\u201d the duchess said instantly. And defensively.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt of it,\u201d Will said, pitching his voice to a soothing tone. \u201cBut will they accept the fact that Lord Xavier miraculously remembers his wife\u2019s face only once he believes his evil second cousin has murdered her? I think your readers would prefer that he at least attempt to save her life.

Certainly in every month.</p><p>And definitely during every consultation with her husband.</p> <p>Romancing a Career, in 1800 and Thereafter</p><p>This novel owes a great deal to its sources, but even more to the readers who have celebrated my work, encouraging me to write an (astonishing to me) twenty-four novels to date. In creating a female author of romance novels around the turn of the nineteenth century, I wanted not only to depict how much fun it can be to plot and write romance, but also to honor the authors of the time. For the most part, the authors\u2019 work is no longer in print, though their novels were enormously popular at the time. Authors like Sarah Scudgell Wilkinson supported themselves writing adventuresome fiction such as The Fugitive Countess (1807). Anna Maria Bennett began her long bestselling career with Anna (1785), whose first printing sold out in one day. The novels could be extremely lucrative: in 1796, Fanny Burney was paid 2,000 pounds for her novel Camilla, including its copyright, which would be over 100,000 in today\u2019s pounds. That doesn\u2019t mean their work was universally celebrated, of course. The review that plagued Mia so much that she can recite it from memory was real; it was published in Graham\u2019s Lady\u2019s Magazine in 1848, and the novel exhibiting \u201cvulgar depravity and unnatural horrors\u201d was Emily Bront\u00eb\u2019s Wuthering Heights.</p><p>I invented the publishing firm of Brandy, Bucknell &amp; Bendal, but in fact, the publisher of Lucibella\u2019s books would likely have been Minerva Press. William Lane established the press in 1790 and thereafter published a constant stream of fiction, as well as operating a circulating library. He specialized in gothic horror-romance novels and would have welcomed Lucibella\u2019s heroines-in-peril. While Lucibella\u2019s prose echoes novels at the time, I took the inheritance plot of An Angel\u2019s Form and a Devil\u2019s Heart (a real novel, written by Selina Davenport and published by Minerva in 1818) from a Dorothy Parker short story called \u201cThe Standard of Living.\u201d</p><p>To ensure they were accessible to the middle and working classes, novels of this type were typically bound in cardboard with leather labels on the spines. Jane Austen\u2019s Emma (1816), for example, first appeared with \u201cplain gray boards\u201d and a title label made from stamped morocco leather. But Chuffy\u2019s more luxurious bindings existed as well: the foremost bookbinder at the time was Roger Payne, who re-bound volumes in Russian leather with gold borders, embedded pearls, and even (on occasion) silk embroidery that reflected the book\u2019s contents.</p><p>If Mia\u2019s character was inspired by late eighteenth-and early nineteenth-century female novelists, Sir Cuthbert owes his appearance and cheerful nature to one of Shakespeare\u2019s great characters, Sir Toby Belch in Twelfth Night. Chuffy mischievously quotes from that play, as Mia recognizes, but my greater hope is that he brings with him the reckless joie de vivre of his predecessor. Talking of quotations, Mia\u2019s much maligned poetry borrows from some of Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s romantic poetry. Finally, young Master Charles Wallace possesses something of the preternatural intelligence of Madeleine L\u2019Engle\u2019s namesake character in A Wrinkle in Time, though arguably Charlie owes more to Charles Dickens\u2019s earnest and captivating disabled child, Tiny Tim. </p> </body></html>"]
