But I\u2019m Mexican, so mi familia is always there to guide me in everything I do, whether I want them to or not. Well, \u201cguide\u201d is too weak a word. \u201cDictate\u201d is more like it.</p><p>Mi'am\u00e1 didn\u2019t ask if I wanted to leave Mexico and move to Colorado to live with my brother Alex for my senior year of high school. She made the decision to send me back to America \u201cfor my own good\u201d\u2014 her words, not mine. When the rest of mi familia backed her up, it was a done deal.</p> <p>Do they really think sending me back to the U.S. will prevent me from ending up six feet under or in jail? Ever since I got fired from the sugar mill two months ago, I\u2019ve lived la vida loca. Nothing is ever gonna change that.</p><p>I look out the small window as the plane soars above the snowcapped Rockies. I\u2019m definitely not in Atencingo anymore . . . and I\u2019m not in the suburbs of Chicago, either, where I lived my entire life before mi'am\u00e1 made us pack up and move to Mexico during my sophomore year.</p><p>When the plane lands, I watch other passengers scramble to get off. I hold back and let this whole situation sink in. I\u2019m about to see my brother for the first time in almost two years. Hell, I\u2019m not even sure I want to see him.</p><p>The plane is almost empty, so I can\u2019t stall anymore. I grab my backpack and follow the signs for the baggage claim area. As I exit the terminal, I see my brother Alex waiting for me beyond the barricade. I thought I might not recognize him, or feel like we were strangers instead of family. But there\u2019s no mistaking my big brother . . . his face is as familiar to me as my own. I get a little satisfaction that I\u2019m taller than him now, and I don\u2019t look anything like that scrawny kid he left behind.</p><p>\u201cYa est\u00e1s en Colorado,\u201d he says as he pulls me into a hug.</p> <p>When he releases me, I notice faint scars above his eyebrows and by his ears that weren\u2019t there the last time I saw him. He looks older, but he\u2019s missing that guarded look he always carried around with him like a shield. I think I inherited that shield.</p><p>\u201cGracias,\u201d I say flatly. He knows I don\u2019t want to be here. Uncle Julio stayed at my side until he forced me on the plane. And then threatened to stay at the airport until he knew my ass was off the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou remember how to speak English?\u201d my brother asks as we walk to the baggage claim.</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cWe only lived in Mexico two years, Alex. Or should I say, me, Mam\u00e1, and Luis moved to Mexico. You ditched us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ditch you. I\u2019m goin\u2019 to college so I can actually do somethin\u2019 productive with my life. You should try it sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I like my unproductive life just fine.\u201d</p> <p>I grab my duffel off the carousel and follow Alex out of the airport.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you wearin\u2019 that around your neck?\u201d my brother asks me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a rosary,\u201d I answer, fingering the black-and-white beaded cross. \u201cI turned religious since I saw you last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReligious, my ass. I know it\u2019s a gang symbol,\u201d he says as we reach a silver Beemer convertible. My brother couldn\u2019t afford a bangin\u2019 car like that; he must have borrowed it from his girlfriend, Brittany.</p><p>\u201cSo what if it is?\u201d Alex was in a gang back in Chicago. Mi pap\u00e1 was a gang member before him. Whether Alex wants to admit it or not, being a badass is my legacy. I tried living by the rules. I never complained when I made less than fifty pesos a day and worked like a dog after school. After I got canned and started running with the Guerreros del barrio, I made over a thousand pesos in one day. It might have been dirty money, but it kept food on our table.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you learn anything from my mistakes?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Shit, when Alex was in the Latino Blood back in Chicago I worshipped him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear my answer to that.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head in frustration, Alex grabs my duffel out of my hand and tosses it in the back of the car. So what if he got jumped out of the Latino Blood? He\u2019ll wear his tattoos the rest of his life. Whether he wants to believe it or not, he\u2019ll always be associated with the LB whether he\u2019s active in the gang or not.</p> <p>I take a long look at my brother. He\u2019s definitely changed; I sensed it from the minute I saw him. He might look like Alex Fuentes, but I can tell he\u2019s lost that fighting spirit he once possessed. Now that he\u2019s in college, he thinks he can play by the rules and make the world a shinier place to live. It\u2019s amazing how quickly he\u2019s forgotten that not too long ago we lived in the slums of the Chicago suburbs. Some parts of the world can\u2019t shine, no matter how much you try and polish off the dirt.</p><p>\u201c\u00bfY Mam\u00e1?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Luis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same. Our little brother is almost as smart as you, Alex. He thinks he\u2019s gonna be an astronaut like Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez.\u201d</p><p>Alex nods like a proud papa, and I think he really does believe Luis can live his dream. The two of them are delusional . . . both my brothers are dreamers. Alex thinks he can save the world by creating cures for diseases and Luis thinks he can leave the world to explore new ones.</p><p>As we turn onto the highway, I see a wall of mountains in the far distance. It reminds me of the rough terrain in Mexico.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called the Front Range,\u201d Alex tells me. \u201cThe university is at the base of the mountains.\u201d He points off to the left. \u201cThose are the Flatirons, \u2019cause the rocks are flat like ironing boards. I\u2019ll take you there sometime. Brit and I take walks there when we want to get away from campus.\u201d</p><p>When he glances at me, I\u2019m looking at my brother like he\u2019s got two heads.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Is he kidding?\u2014\u00bfMe est\u00e1 tomando los pelos? \u201cI\u2019m just wondering who you are and what the hell you did with my brother. My brother Alex used to be a rebel, and now he\u2019s talkin\u2019 about mountains, ironin\u2019 boards, and takin\u2019 walks with his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather I talked about getting drunk and fucked up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I say, acting like I\u2019m excited. \u201cAnd then you can tell me where I can get drunk and fucked up, \u2019cause I won\u2019t last long if I don\u2019t get some kind of illegal substance in my system,\u201d I lie. Mi'am\u00e1 probably told him she suspects I\u2019m into drugs, so I might as well play the part.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Save the bullshit for Mam\u00e1, Carlos. I don\u2019t fall for it any more than you do.\u201d</p><p>I put my feet up on the dash. \u201cYou have no clue.\u201d</p><p>Alex shoves them down. \u201cDo you mind? It\u2019s Brittany\u2019s car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are seriously whipped, man. When are you gonna dump that gringa and start bein\u2019 a normal college guy who hooks up with a bunch of girls?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cBrittany and I don\u2019t date other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called being boyfriend and girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called bein\u2019 a panocha. It\u2019s not natural for a guy to be with one girl, Alex. I\u2019m a free agent and I plan to stay one forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re clear, Se\u00f1or Free Agent, you\u2019re not screwin\u2019 anyone in my apartment.\u201d</p><p>He might be my older brother, but our father has been dead and buried a long time. I don\u2019t want or need his bullshit rules. It\u2019s time I set some of my own. \u201cJust so you\u2019re clear, I plan on doin\u2019 whatever the fuck I want while I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do us both a favor and listen to me. You might actually learn somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I give a short laugh. Yeah, right. What am I gonna learn from him, how to fill out college applications? Do thermal chemistry experiments? I don\u2019t plan on doing either of those.</p><p>We\u2019re both silent as we drive for another forty-five minutes, the mountains getting closer and closer with each mile. We pass right through the University of Colorado at Boulder campus. Redbrick buildings jut out of the landscape and college students with backpacks are scattered everywhere. Does Alex think he can beat the odds and actually find a high-paying job so he won\u2019t be poor the rest of his life? Fat chance of that happening. People will take one look at him and his tattoos and throw his ass out the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to be at work in an hour, but I\u2019ll get you settled in first,\u201d he says as he pulls into a parking space.</p><p>I know he got a job working at some auto-body shop to help him pay off a shitload of school and government loans.</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d he says as he points to the building in front of us. \u201cTu casa.\u201d</p><p>This round eight-story eyesore of a building resembling a giant corncob is the farthest thing from being a home, but whatever. I pull my duffel out of the trunk and follow Alex inside.</p><p>\u201cI hope this is the poor side of town, Alex,\u201d I say. \u201c \u2019Cause I get hives around rich people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not livin\u2019 in luxury, if that\u2019s what you mean. It\u2019s subsidized student apartments.\u201d</p><p>We ride the elevator to the fourth floor. The hallway smells like stale pizza, and a bunch of stains are scattered across the carpet. Two hot girls in workout clothes pass us. Alex smiles at them. From their dreamy reaction I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they suddenly kneeled down and kissed the ground he walks on.</p><p>\u201cMandi and Jessica, this is my brother Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHel-lo, Carlos . . .\u201d Jessica scans me up and down\u2014 I have definitely reached horny college central. And I\u2019m definitely feelin\u2019 it. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us he was a hottie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in high school,\u201d Alex warns them.</p><p>What is he, my cock-blocker? \u201cA senior,\u201d I blurt out, hoping that\u2019ll lessen the blow that I\u2019m not a college guy. \u201cI\u2019ll be eighteen in a couple months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll throw you a birthday party,\u201d Mandi says.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I say. \u201cCan I have you two as my presents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Alex doesn\u2019t mind,\u201d Mandi says.</p><p>Alex walks away and weaves a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get myself in trouble if I get into this discussion.\u201d</p><p>This time, the girls laugh. Then they jog down the hall, but not before looking back and waving bye.</p><p>We go in Alex\u2019s apartment. He\u2019s definitely not living in the lap of luxury. A twin bed with a thin black fleece blanket is off to the side of the room, a table and four chairs are on the right, and a kitchen so small that two people would have a hard time fitting in together is by the front door. This isn\u2019t even a one-bedroom apartment. It\u2019s a studio. A small studio.</p><p>Alex points to a door next to his bed. \u201cThere\u2019s the bathroom. You can put your stuff in the closet across from the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>I toss my duffel in the closet and walk farther into the apartment. \u201cUm, Alex . . . where do you expect me to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI borrowed a blow-up bed from Mandi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEst\u00e1 buena\u2014 she\u2019s cute.\u201d I check out the room again. In our house back in Chicago I shared a much smaller room with Alex and Luis. \u201cWhere\u2019s the TV?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>Shit. That\u2019s not good. \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do when I\u2019m bored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEst\u00e1s chiflado, you\u2019re crazy. I don\u2019t read.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStartin\u2019 tomorrow you do,\u201d he says as he opens the window to let in some fresh air. \u201cI\u2019ve already had your transcripts sent. They\u2019re expectin\u2019 you at Flatiron High tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>School? My brother is talkin\u2019 about school? Man, that\u2019s the last thing a seventeen-year-old guy wants to think about. I thought he\u2019d at least give me a week to adjust to living in the U.S. again. Time to change course. \u201cWhere do you stash your weed?\u201d I say, knowing I\u2019m pushing his patience to the limit. \u201cYou should prob\u2019ly tell me now so I don\u2019t have to go rummagin\u2019 through your place tryin\u2019 to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Then who\u2019s your dealer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, Carlos. I don\u2019t do that shit anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said you work. Don\u2019t you make money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, so I can afford to eat, go to college, and send whatever\u2019s left to Mam\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>Just as that news is sinking in, the apartment door opens. I recognize my brother\u2019s blond girlfriend immediately, her keys to his apartment and her purse in one hand and a big brown paper bag in the other. She looks like a Barbie doll come to life. My brother takes the bag and kisses her. They might as well be married. \u201cCarlos, you remember Brittany.\u201d</p><p>She opens her arms out wide and pulls me close. \u201cCarlos, it\u2019s so great to have you here!\u201d Brittany says in a cheery voice. I almost forgot she used to be a cheerleader back in high school, but as soon as she opens her mouth I can\u2019t help but remember.</p><p>\u201cFor who?\u201d I say stiffly.</p><p>She pulls back. \u201cFor you. And for Alex. He misses having his family around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>She clears her throat and looks a little uneasy. \u201cUmm . . . okay, well, I brought you guys some Chinese food for lunch. I hope you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re Mexican,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get Mexican food?\u201d</p><p>Brittany\u2019s perfectly shaped eyebrows furrow. \u201cThat was a joke, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>She turns toward the kitchen. \u201cAlex, want to help me out here?\u201d</p><p>Alex appears with paper plates and plastic utensils in his hands. \u201cCarlos, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNo problem. I was just askin\u2019 your girlfriend why she didn\u2019t get Mexican food. She\u2019s the one who got all defensive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave some manners and say \u2018thank you\u2019 instead of makin\u2019 her feel like crap.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s crystal clear whose side my brother is on. At one time Alex said he joined the Latino Blood to protect our family, so Luis and I didn\u2019t have to join. But I can see now that family means crap to him.</p><p>Brittany holds her hands up. \u201cI don\u2019t want you two getting in a fight because of me.\u201d She pushes her purse farther on her shoulder and sighs. \u201cI think I better go and let you two get reacquainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>Dios m\u00edo, I think my brother lost his balls somewhere between here and Mexico. Or maybe Brittany has them zipped inside that fancy purse. \u201cAlex, let her go if she wants.\u201d It\u2019s time to break the leash she\u2019s got him on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Really,\u201d she says, then kisses my brother. \u201cEnjoy the lunch. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Bye, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d As soon as she\u2019s gone, I grab the brown bag off the kitchen counter and bring it to the table. I read the labels on each container. Chicken chow mein . . . beef chow fun . . . pu-pu platter. \u201cPu-pu platter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of appetizers,\u201d Alex explains.</p><p>I\u2019m not goin\u2019 near anything with the word \u201cpu-pu\u201d in it. I\u2019m annoyed that my brother even knows what a pu-pu platter is. I leave that container alone as I scoop myself a plateful of the identifiable Chinese food and start chowing down. \u201cAren\u2019t you gonna eat?\u201d I ask Alex.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me as if I\u2019m some stranger.</p><p>\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 pasa?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBrittany\u2019s not goin\u2019 anywhere, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. Can\u2019t you see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What I see is my seventeen-year-old brother actin\u2019 like he\u2019s five. It\u2019s time to grow up, mocoso.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can be as borin\u2019 as shit like you? No thanks.\u201d</p><p>Alex grabs his keys.</p><p>\u201cWhere you goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo apologize to my girlfriend, then head to work. Make yourself at home,\u201d he says, tossing me a key to the apartment. \u201cAnd stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re talkin\u2019 to Brittany,\u201d I say as I bite off the end of an egg roll, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you ask her for your huevos back.\u201d</p><p>2</p><p>Kiara</p><p>\u201cKiara, I can\u2019t believe he text-dumped you,\u201d my best friend, Tuck, says, reading the three sentences on my cell phone screen as he sits at the desk in my room. \u201cIt\u2019s nt wrkg out. Sry. Don\u2019t h8 me.\u201d He tosses the phone back to me. \u201cThe least he could have done is spell it out. Don\u2019t h8 me? The guy\u2019s a joke. Of course you\u2019re gonna hate him.\u201d</p><p>I lie back on my bed and stare at the ceiling, remembering the first time Michael and I kissed. It was at the outdoor summer concert in Niwot behind the ice cream vendor. \u201cI liked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well I never did. Don\u2019t trust someone you meet in the waiting room at your therapist\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>I flip onto my stomach and sit up on my elbows. \u201cIt was speech therapy. And he just drove his brother for sessions.\u201d</p><p>Tuck, who has never liked a guy I\u2019ve dated, pulls out a pink skull-and-crossbones notebook from my desk drawer. He shakes his index finger at me. \u201cNever trust a guy who tells you he loves you on the second date. Happened to me once. It was a total joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you believe in love at first sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I believe in lust at first sight. And attraction. But not love. Michael told you he loved you just so he could get into your pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a guy, that\u2019s how I know.\u201d Tuck frowns. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do it with him, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say, shaking my head to emphasize my answer. We fooled around, but I didn\u2019t want to take it to the next level. I just, I don\u2019t know . . . I wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen or talked to Michael since school started two weeks ago. Sure, we texted a few times, but he always said he was busy and would call when he got a minute. He\u2019s a senior in Longmont twenty minutes away and I go to school in Boulder, so I just thought he was busy with school stuff. But now I know the reason we haven\u2019t talked wasn\u2019t because he was busy. It was because he wanted to break up.</p><p>Was it because of another girl?</p><p>Was it because I wasn\u2019t pretty enough?</p><p>Was it because I wouldn\u2019t have sex with him?</p><p>It can\u2019t be because I stutter. I\u2019ve been working on my speech all summer and haven\u2019t stuttered once since June. Every week I went to speech therapy, every day I practice speaking in front of a mirror, every minute I\u2019m conscious of the words that come out of my mouth. Before now I always had to worry when I spoke, waiting for that confused look people got and then that \u201cOh, I understand\u2014 she\u2019s got a problem\u201d revelation. Then came the look of pity. And then the \u201cshe must be stupid\u201d assumption. Or, in the case of some of the girls in my school, my stuttering was the source of amusement.</p><p>But I don\u2019t stutter anymore.</p><p>Tuck knows this is the year I\u2019m determined to show my confident side\u2014 the side I\u2019ve never shown the kids at school. I\u2019ve been shy and introverted my first three years of high school, because I\u2019ve had an intense fear of people making fun of me stuttering. From now on instead of Kiara Westford being remembered for being shy, they\u2019re going to remember me as the one who wasn\u2019t afraid to speak up.</p><p>I didn\u2019t count on Michael breaking up with me. I thought we\u2019d go to Homecoming together, and prom . . .</p><p>\u201cStop thinking about Michael,\u201d Tuck orders.</p><p>\u201cHe was cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is a hairy ferret, but I wouldn\u2019t want to date one. You could do better than him. Don\u2019t sell yourself short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d I tell him. \u201cFace reality, Tuck. I\u2019m no Madison Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for that. I hate Madison Stone.\u201d</p><p>Madison raises the term \u201cmean girls\u201d to an entirely new level. The girl is good at everything she tries and could be easily crowned the most popular girl in school. Every girl wants to be friends with her so they can hang with the cool crowd. Madison Stone creates the cool crowd. \u201cEveryone likes her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re afraid of her. Secretly everyone hates her.\u201d Tuck starts scribbling words in my notebook, then hands it to me. \u201cHere,\u201d he says, then tosses me a pen.</p><p>I stare at the page. RULES OF ATTRACTION is written on top, and a big line is drawn down the center of the page.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the left column write down all the great things about you.\u201d</p><p>Is he kidding? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, start writing. Consider this a self-help exercise, and a way for you to realize that girls like Madison Stone aren\u2019t even attractive. Finish the sentence I, Kiara Westford, am great because . . .\u201d</p><p>I know Tuck isn\u2019t going to let up, so I write something stupid and hand it back to him.</p><p>He reads my words and cringes. \u201cI, Kiara, am great because . . . I know how to throw a football, change the oil in my car, and hike a fourteener. Ugh, guys don\u2019t care about this stuff.\u201d He grabs the pen from me, sits on the edge of my bed, and starts writing furiously. \u201cLet\u2019s get the basics down. You\u2019ve got to measure attractiveness in three parts to get the full result.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho made up those rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. These are Tuck Reese\u2019s Rules of Attraction. First, we start with personality. You\u2019re smart, funny, and sarcastic,\u201d he says, listing each one in the notebook.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure all of those are good things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, they are. But wait, I\u2019m not done. You\u2019re also a loyal friend, you love a challenge more than most guys I know, and you\u2019re a great sister to Brandon.\u201d He looks up when he\u2019s done writing. \u201cThe second part is your skills. You know about fixing cars, you\u2019re athletic, and you know when to shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat last one isn\u2019t a skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, trust me. It\u2019s a skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot my special spinach and walnut salad.\u201d I can\u2019t cook, but that salad is an all-time favorite.</p><p>\u201cYou do make a killer salad,\u201d he says, adding that to the list. \u201cOkay, on to the last part\u2014 physical traits.\u201d Tuck looks me up and down, assessing me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I moan, wondering when this humiliation will end. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a cow about to be auctioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, whatever. You\u2019ve got flawless skin and a perky nose to match your tits. If I wasn\u2019t gay I might be tempted to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww.\u201d I slap his hand away from the paper. \u201cTuck, can you please not say or write that word?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his long hair out of his eyes. \u201cWhat, tits?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUgh. Yes, that one. Just say boobs or breasts, please. The \u2018t\u2019 word just sounds so . . . vulgar.\u201d</p><p>Tuck snorts and rolls his eyes. \u201cOkay, perky . . . breasts.\u201d He laughs, totally amused. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kiara, that just sounds like something you\u2019re gonna barbeque for lunch or order off a menu.\u201d He pretends my notebook is a menu as he recites in a fake English accent, \u201cYes, waiter, I\u2019d like the barbequed perky breasts with a side of coleslaw.\u201d</p><p>I throw Mojo, my big blue teddy bear, at Tuck\u2019s head. \u201cJust call \u2019em privates and move on.\u201d</p><p>Mojo bounces right off him and lands on the floor. My best friend doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cPerky tits, scratch. Perky breasts, scratch.\u201d He makes a big deal of crossing both those out. \u201cReplace with . . . perky privates,\u201d he says, writing each word down as he says it. \u201cLong legs, and long eyelashes.\u201d He eyes my hands and wrinkles his nose. \u201cNo offense, but you could use a manicure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Can you think of anything else?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so now that we know how fabulous you are, we need to make a list of what kind of guy you want. We\u2019ll write this on the right side of the page. Let\u2019s start with personality. You want a guy who is . . . fill in the blank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a guy who\u2019s confident. Really confident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he says, writing it down.</p><p>\u201cI want a guy who\u2019s nice to me.\u201d</p> <p>Tuck continues writing. \u201cNice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a guy who\u2019s smart,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cStreet smarts or book smarts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d I question, not knowing if it\u2019s the right or wrong answer.</p><p>He pats me on the head like I\u2019m a little kid. \u201cGood. Let\u2019s move on to skills.\u201d He shushes me, stopping me from contributing. Fine by me. \u201cI\u2019ll write this part down for you. You want a guy who has the same skills as you have, and then some. Someone who likes sports, someone who can at least appreciate your interest in fixing up that stupid old car of yours, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d I jump off my bed. \u201cI almost forgot. I need to go into town and pick up something from the auto-body shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s fuzzy dice to hang on your rearview mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fuzzy dice. It\u2019s a radio. A vintage one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, goodie! A vintage one, to match your vintage car!\u201d Tuck says sarcastically, then claps a bunch of times in fake excitement.</p><p>I roll my eyes at him. \u201cWanna come with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He closes my notebook and shoves it back in my desk. \u201cThe last thing I want to do is hang around and listen to you talk about cars with people who actually care.\u201d</p><p>After I drop off Tuck at his house, it takes me fifteen minutes to get to McConnell\u2019s Auto Body. I pull my car into the shop and find Alex, one of the mechanics, bent over the engine of a VW Beetle. Alex was one of my dad\u2019s students. Last year, after a study session, my dad found out that Alex works on cars. He told Alex about the 1972 Monte Carlo I\u2019ve been restoring, and Alex has been helping me get parts for it ever since.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kiara.\u201d He wipes his hands on a shop cloth, and asks me to wait while he gets my radio. \u201cHere it is,\u201d he says, opening the box. He pulls out the radio and removes it from the bubble wrap. Wires are sticking out of the back like spindly legs, but it\u2019s just perfect. I know I shouldn\u2019t be so excited about a radio, but the dash wouldn\u2019t be complete without it. The one that came with my car never worked and the front plastic was cracked, so Alex has been looking online to find me an authentic replacement.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to test it, though,\u201d he says as he wiggles each wire to make sure the connections are solid. \u201cI had to pick up my brother at the airport, so I couldn\u2019t come in early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he visiting from Mexico?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not visitin\u2019. He\u2019ll be a senior at Flatiron startin\u2019 tomorrow,\u201d he says as he fills out an invoice. \u201cYou go there, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>He puts the radio back in the box. \u201cDo you need help installin\u2019 it?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think so before I saw it up close, but now I\u2019m not so sure. \u201cMaybe,\u201d I tell him. \u201cLast time I soldered wires, I messed them up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t pay for it now,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got time tomorrow after school, stop by and I\u2019ll put it in. That\u2019ll give me time to test the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Alex.\u201d</p><p>He looks up from the invoice and taps his pen on the counter. \u201cI know this is gonna sound loco, but can you help show my brother around school? He doesn\u2019t know anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a peer outreach program at school,\u201d I say, proud that I can help. \u201cI can meet you in the principal\u2019s office in the morning and sign up to be his peer guide.\u201d The old Kiara would have been too shy and would never have offered, but not the new Kiara.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to warn you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother can be tough to deal with.\u201d</p><p>My lips turn into a wide grin, because as Tuck pointed out . . . \u201cI love a good challenge.\u201d</p><p>3</p><p>Carlos</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a peer guide.\u201d</p><p>Those are the first words out of my mouth as Mr. House, the Flatiron High School principal, introduces me to Kiara Westford.</p><p>\u201cWe pride ourselves on our peer outreach programs,\u201d Mr. House says to Alex. \u201cThey help ensure a smooth transition.\u201d</p><p>My brother nods. \u201cNo problem with me. I\u2019m sold on the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I mumble. I don\u2019t need a damn peer guide because (1) it\u2019s obvious from the way Alex greeted Kiara a few minutes ago that he knows her, and (2) the girl is not hot; she has her hair up in a ponytail, is wearing leather hiking boots with three-quarter stretch pants with an Under Armour logo peeking out the bottom, and is covered from neck to knee by an oversized T-shirt with the word MOUNTAINEER written on it, and (3) I don\u2019t need a babysitter, especially one that my brother arranged.</p><p>Mr. House sits in his big, brown leather chair and hands Kiara a copy of my schedule. Great, so now the girl knows where I\u2019m supposed to be every second of the day. If this situation weren\u2019t so humiliatin\u2019, it\u2019d be hilarious.</p><p>\u201cThis is a big school, Carlos,\u201d House says as if I can\u2019t figure out the map on my own. \u201cKiara is an exemplary student. She\u2019ll show you to your locker and escort you to each class for your first week here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d the girl asks with a big grin. \u201cThe first-period late bell already rang.\u201d</p><p>Can I request another peer guide, one who isn\u2019t so happy to be at school at seven thirty a.m.?</p><p>Alex waves me off, and I\u2019m tempted to flip him the finger but I\u2019m not sure the principal would appreciate it.</p><p>I follow the exemplary student out into the empty hallway and I think I\u2019ve entered hell. Lockers line the hallways and signs are taped to the walls. One says YES WE KAHN!\u2014VOTE FOR MEGAN KAHN FOR STUDENT PRESIDENT and another reads JASON TU\u2014YOUR \u201cGO-TU GUY\u201d FOR STUDENT COUNCIL TREASURER! are displayed along with the rest of the signs from people who actually want to MAKE HEALTHIER STUDENT LUNCHES THE NORM!\u2014VOTE FOR NORM REDDING.</p><p>Healthier student lunches?</p><p>Hell, back in Mexico you ate what you brought from home or whatever crap they put in front of you. There weren\u2019t choices. Where I lived in Mexico you ate to survive, without worrying about counting calories or carbs. That\u2019s not to say that some people don\u2019t live like kings in Mexico. Like in America, there are definitely the rich areas in every one of the thirty-one Mexican states . . . but my family just didn\u2019t live in any of \u2019em.</p><p>I don\u2019t belong at Flatiron High, and I sure as hell don\u2019t want to follow this girl around all week. I wonder how much the exemplary student can take before she gives up and quits.</p><p>She directs me to my locker and I shove my stuff inside. \u201cMy locker is two away from yours,\u201d she announces, as if that\u2019s actually a good thing. When I\u2019m ready, she studies my schedule and walks down the hall at the same time. \u201cMr. Hennesey\u2019s class is one flight up.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el servicio?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cHuh? I don\u2019t take Spanish. Je parle fran\u00e7ais\u2014 I speak French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Do a lot of French people live in Colorado?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I want to do a semester abroad in France my sophomore year of college like my mom did.\u201d</p><p>My mom didn\u2019t even finish high school. She got pregnant with Alex and married my dad.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re learnin\u2019 a language that you\u2019ll use for one semester? Sounds stupid to me.\u201d I stop when we reach a door with a male stick figure painted on it. With my thumb, I point to the door. \u201cServicio is bathroom . . . I asked where the bathroom is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She looks a little confused, as if not exactly knowing how to handle deviations from the schedule. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll just wait out here for you.\u201d</p><p>Time to have a little fun by screwin\u2019 with my peer guide. \u201cUnless you want to come inside and show me around . . . I mean, I don\u2019t know how far you wanna take this whole peer guide thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that far.\u201d She purses her lips like she just sucked on a sour lemon and shakes her head. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>In the bathroom, I brace my hands on the sink and take a deep breath. All I can see in the mirror above the sink is a guy whose family thinks he\u2019s a total fuckup.</p><p>Maybe I should have told mi'am\u00e1 the truth: that I got fired from the mill for protecting little fifteen-year-old Emilie Juarez from being harassed by one of the supervisors. It was bad enough she had to quit school and start working to help her family put food on their table. When our boss thought he could put his filthy hands on her just because he was el jefe, I went ballistic. Yeah, it cost me my job . . . but it was worth it and I\u2019d do it again even if it had the same consequences.</p><p>A knock on the door brings me back to reality, and the fact that I have to be escorted to class by a girl who dresses like she\u2019s goin\u2019 mountain climbing. I can\u2019t imagine a girl like Kiara ever needing a guy to fight for her, because if any guy threatened her she\u2019d probably suffocate him with her oversized tee.</p><p>The door creaks open the slightest bit. \u201cYou still in there?\u201d Kiara\u2019s voice echoes through the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou almost done?\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. When I walk out of the bathroom a minute later and head toward the stairs, I notice my escort isn\u2019t following. She\u2019s standing in the empty hallway, that sour look still plastered on her face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even have to go,\u201d she says, sounding annoyed. \u201cYou were stalling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d I say flatly, then take the stairs up two at a time.</p><p>Score one for Carlos Fuentes.</p> <p>I hear her footsteps tapping on the floor behind me, trying to catch up. I walk down the second-floor hall, thinking of ways I can ditch her.</p><p>\u201cThanks for making me super late to class for no reason,\u201d she says, hurrying up behind me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame me. Wasn\u2019t my idea to have a babysitter. And, for the record, I can find my way around just fine on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asks. \u201cBecause you just passed Mr. Hennesey\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Shit.</p> <p>One point for the exemplary student.</p><p>Score is 1\u20131. Thing is, I don\u2019t like ties. I like to win . . . by big margins.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but be annoyed at the flash of amusement in my peer guide\u2019s eyes.</p><p>I step closer to her, really close. \u201cHave you ever cut class?\u201d I ask her, mischief and flirting laced in my voice. I\u2019m trying to throw her off so I have the upper hand again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she says slowly, looking nervous.</p><p>Good. I lean in even closer. \u201cWe should try it together sometime,\u201d I say softly, then open the classroom door.</p> <p>I hear her suck in a breath. Listen, I didn\u2019t ask for a face and body girls find attractive. But thanks to the mixture of my parents\u2019 DNA, I\u2019ve got them, and I\u2019m not ashamed to use \u2019em. Having a face Adonis would admire is one of the few advantages I\u2019ve been given in life, and I use it to its fullest potential whether it\u2019s for good or evil.</p><p>Kiara quickly introduces me to Mr. Hennesey, then just as quickly she\u2019s out the door. I hope my flirting has scared her off for good. If not, I might have to try harder next time. I sit in math class and scan the room. All of the kids here look like they come from upper-class homes. This school is nothing like Fairfield, the Chicago suburb I lived in before we moved to Mexico. At Fairfield High, we had rich kids and poor kids. Flatiron High is more like one of those expensive private high schools back in Chicago, where every kid wears designer labels and drives fancy cars.</p><p>We used to make fun of those kids. Now I\u2019m surrounded by them.</p><p>As soon as math is over, Kiara is waiting outside the classroom. I can\u2019t believe it.</p><p>\u201cSo how was it?\u201d she asks over the noise of everyone else rushing to their next class.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to answer honestly, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. Come on, we only have five minutes.\u201d She weaves her way through the students. I follow behind, watching her ponytail sway like a horse\u2019s tail with every step she takes. \u201cAlex warned me you were a rebel.\u201d</p><p>She ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet. \u201cHow do you know my brother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was one of my dad\u2019s students. And he helps me with the car I\u2019m restoring.\u201d</p><p>This chica is unreal. Restoring a car? \u201cWhat do you know about cars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you,\u201d she says over her shoulder.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She stops in front of a classroom. \u201cHere\u2019s your bio class.\u201d</p><p>A hot chick passes us and goes in the room. She\u2019s wearing tight jeans and an even tighter shirt. \u201cWhoa, who was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadison Stone,\u201d Kiara mutters.</p><p>\u201cIntroduce me to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Because I know it\u2019ll annoy the shit out of you. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She clutches her books to her chest, almost as if they\u2019re a shield of armor. \u201cI can think of five reasons off the top of my head.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cOkay. List \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no time, the bell is about to ring. Do you think you can introduce yourself to Mrs. Shevelenko? I just remembered I forgot my French homework in my locker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better hurry.\u201d I look at my wrist, which doesn\u2019t have a watch wrapped around it, but I don\u2019t think she notices. \u201cThe bell is about to ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just meet you here after class.\u201d She runs down the hall.</p><p>In class, I wait for Shevelenko to look up from her desk and acknowledge me. She\u2019s on her laptop, sending what looks like personal e-mail.</p><p>I clear my throat to get her attention. She glances at me, then changes programs. \u201cChoose any seat. I\u2019ll call attendance in a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m new,\u201d I tell her. She should have figured that one out on her own because I haven\u2019t been in her class the past two weeks, but whatever.</p><p>\u201cAre you that exchange student from Mexico?\u201d</p><p>Not really. It\u2019s called transfer student, but I don\u2019t think this woman cares about the details. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but notice the beads of sweat on her peach-fuzz mustache. I\u2019m pretty certain there are, you know, people who can take care of that. My aunt Consuelo had the same problem until my mom got ahold of her and some hot wax and put them in the same room together.</p><p>\u201cYou speak Spanish or English at home?\u201d Shevelenko asks.</p><p>I\u2019m not even sure that\u2019s a legal question, but whatever. \u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>She cranes her neck and scans the rest of the class. \u201cRamiro, come here.\u201d</p><p>This Latino kid walks up to her desk. The guy is a taller version of Alex\u2019s best friend, Paco. When they were seniors in high school, Alex and Paco got shot, and our entire lives turned upside down. Paco died. I don\u2019t know if any of us will ever fully get over what happened. Right after my brother got out of the hospital, we moved to Mexico to stay with family. Since the shooting, nothing\u2019s been the same.</p><p>\u201cRamiro, this is . . .\u201d Shevelenko looks up at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos.\u201d</p><p>She eyes the Ramiro kid. \u201cHe\u2019s Mexican, you\u2019re Mexican. Make sure you two Spanish speakers pair up.\u201d</p><p>I follow Ramiro back to one of the lab tables. \u201cIs she for real?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cPretty much. Last year I heard Heavy Shevy called this guy Ivan \u2018The Russian\u2019 for six months before she learned his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavy Shevy?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Ramiro says. \u201cI didn\u2019t make it up. She\u2019s had that nickname for at least twenty years.\u201d</p><p>The class bell rings, but everybody is still talking. Heavy Shevy is back on her computer, still busy with her e-mail.</p><p>\u201cMe llamo Ramiro, but it\u2019s too beaner so everyone calls me Ram.\u201d</p><p>My name\u2019s beaner, too, but I don\u2019t feel the need to dis my heritage and change my name to Carl to fit in. One look at me and you know I\u2019m Latino, so why pretend to be somethin\u2019 else? I\u2019ve always accused Alex of wanting to be white because he refuses to be called by his given name, Alejandro.</p><p>\u201cMe llamo Carlos. You can call me Carlos.\u201d</p><p>Now that I\u2019m paying more attention to him, I notice that Ram\u2019s wearing some golf shirt with a designer logo. He might have family in Mexico, but I bet su familia doesn\u2019t live anywhere near mine.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s there to do for fun here?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cThe question is what\u2019s there not to do,\u201d Ram says. \u201cHang out at Pearl Street Mall, go to the movies, hike, snowboard, raft, mountain climb, party with chicks from Niwot and Longmont.\u201d</p><p>None of those things are my idea of fun, except for the partying part.</p><p>Across the table from us is that hot girl Madison. Along with her tight clothes, she\u2019s got long, streaked blond hair, a big smile, and even bigger chichis that actually rival Brittany\u2019s. Not that I\u2019m lookin\u2019 at my brother\u2019s girlfriend, but they\u2019re kinda hard to miss.</p><p>Madison leans across the table. \u201cI hear you\u2019re the new guy,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m Madison. And you are . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos,\u201d Ram blurts out before I can say anythin\u2019.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he can introduce himself, Ram,\u201d she hisses, then tucks her hair behind her ear, showing off diamond earrings that might actually blind someone if the sun hit \u2019em at the right angle. She leans toward me and bites her bottom lip. \u201cYou\u2019re the new guy from Meh-hee-co?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s always irritating when the white kids try to sound like they\u2019re Mexican. I wonder what else she\u2019s heard about me. \u201cS\u00ed,\u201d I say.</p><p>She flashes me a sexy smile and leans closer. \u201cEst\u00e1s muy caliente.\u201d I think she just called me hot. That\u2019s not the way we say it in Meh-hee-co, but I get the idea. \u201cI could use a good Spanish tutor. My last one turned out to be a total loser.\u201d</p><p>Ram clears his throat. \u201c\u00a1Qu\u00e9 tipa! If you haven\u2019t guessed, I was her last tutor.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still watching Madison. She\u2019s definitely got it goin\u2019 on, and obviously has no problem flaunting her assets. While honey-skinned, exotic Mexican chicas are my usual type, I suspect no guy can resist Madison. And she knows it.</p><p>When a girl calls her over to the next table, I turn to Ram. \u201cDid\u2019ja tutor her, or date her?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cBoth. Sometimes simultaneously. We broke up a month ago. Take my advice and stay away. She bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiterally?\u201d I ask, grinning.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, you don\u2019t want to get close enough to her to find out the answer to that question. Just know that toward the end of our relationship, I became the student and she became the tutor. And I\u2019m not talkin\u2019 \u2019bout Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEst\u00e1 sabrosa. I\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go for it, man,\u201d Ram says with a shrug, just as Heavy Shevy gets up and starts to teach. \u201cBut don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t plan on bein\u2019 anyone\u2019s boyfriend, but I wouldn\u2019t mind bringin\u2019 a couple of girls from Flatiron High back to Alex\u2019s place just to prove I\u2019m the complete opposite of him. I glance back at Madison and she smiles like there\u2019s a promise of something more. Yeah, she\u2019d definitely be perfect to bring home to Alex. She\u2019s like Brittany, but without the halo over her head.</p><p>After suffering through my morning classes, I\u2019m definitely ready for lunch. When the bell rings, I\u2019m glad Kiara\u2019s not outside waiting for me like she said she would. I head to my locker to get the lunch I packed from Alex\u2019s fridge.</p><p>Maybe my peer guide quit. That\u2019s cool with me, except it takes me ten minutes to find the cafeteria. When I walk into the lunchroom, I\u2019m ready to sit by myself at one of the round tables until I see Ram waving me over.</p><p>\u201cThanks for ditching me,\u201d a voice says from behind me.</p><p>I glance back at my peer guide. \u201cI thought you quit.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head as if that\u2019s the most ridiculous thing she\u2019s ever heard. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t quit. I just couldn\u2019t get out of class early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d I say, pretending to be sympathetic. \u201cI would have waited if I knew . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d She nods at Ram\u2019s table. \u201cGo sit with Ram. I saw him waving you over.\u201d</p><p>I give her a shocked look. \u201cAre you actually givin\u2019 me permission to sit with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can sit with me,\u201d she says, as if that\u2019s an option I\u2019d jump at.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>While Kiara stands in the hot-lunch line, I walk over to Ram\u2019s table. I straddle the back of a chair as Ram introduces me to his friends, all white dudes that look like clones of one another. They\u2019re talking about girls and sports and their fantasy football teams. I doubt any of them would survive one day at the sugar mill back in Mexico. Some of my friends made less than fifteen dollars a day. These guys\u2019 watches probably cost more than some of my friends\u2019 yearly salaries.</p><p>Madison appears at our table when Ram goes back to the cafeteria line. \u201cHey, guys,\u201d she says. \u201cMy parents are going out of town this weekend. I\u2019m having a party on Friday night if y\u2019all want to come. Just don\u2019t tell Ram about it.\u201d</p><p>Madison reaches into her purse and pulls out a tube of lip gloss. She dips the wand in a bunch of times, then puckers up and places it on her lips. Just when I think she\u2019s done, her lips form a perfect O and she swirls the wand around and around. I check to see if anyone else is following the erotic lip-gloss show. Sure enough, two of Ram\u2019s friends have stopped talking and are totally focused on Madison and her special talent. Ram comes back and is totally focused on eating his slice of pepperoni pizza.</p><p>The smack of Madison\u2019s lips brings my attention back to her. \u201cCarlos, let me write down my info for you,\u201d she says, then pulls out a pen and grabs my arm. She starts writing her phone number and address on my forearm above my tats as if she\u2019s an artist. When she\u2019s done, she waves by wiggling her fingers, then walks away to sit with her friends.</p> <p>I take a bite of my sandwich and scan the cafeteria, searching for Kiara, the anti-Madison. She\u2019s sitting with a guy with shaggy blond hair that falls in his face. The dude is about my height, my build. Is he her boyfriend? If he is, I feel sorry for him. Kiara is the kind of girl who would expect her boyfriend to be submissive and kiss her ass.</p><p>My body and mind aren\u2019t wired to be submissive, and you\u2019ll find me dead before you find me kissin\u2019 anyone\u2019s ass.</p><p>4</p><p>Kiara</p><p>\u201cSo how was being a peer guide?\u201d my mom asks me at the dinner table. \u201cI know you were looking forward to it this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the best,\u201d I answer as I hand my little brother a third napkin because he\u2019s got spaghetti sauce all over his face.</p> <p>I think back to the end of eighth period, when I showed up to Carlos\u2019s class only to find he\u2019d already left for the day. \u201cCarlos ditched me twice.\u201d</p><p>Dad, a psychologist who thinks people are specimens to be analyzed, furrows his brows as he scoops up a second helping of green beans. \u201cDitch you? Why would he do that?\u201d</p><p>Um . . . \u201cBecause he thinks he\u2019s too cool to be escorted around school.\u201d</p><p>My mom pats my hand. \u201cDitching your peer guide is not cool at all, but be patient with him. He\u2019s been displaced. It\u2019s not easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s right. Don\u2019t be too judgmental, Kiara,\u201d my dad says. \u201cHe\u2019s probably just trying to find out where he fits in. Alex stopped in my office after class and we had a long talk. Poor kid. He\u2019s just twenty himself, and now he\u2019s responsible for a seventeen-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite Carlos over tomorrow after school?\u201d Mom suggests.</p><p>Dad points his fork at her. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sure the last thing Carlos wants to do is come to my house. He\u2019s made it perfectly clear he\u2019s just tolerating me this week because he has to. Once my peer guide job is done on Friday, he\u2019s probably going to have a party to celebrate. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Mom says, ignoring my hesitation. \u201cI\u2019ll make cookies from this new orange-marmalade recipe Joanie gave me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure Carlos will appreciate orange-marmalade cookies, but . . . \u201cI\u2019ll ask him. But don\u2019t be surprised if he says no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if he says yes,\u201d Dad says, always the optimist.</p><p>The next morning, as I\u2019m escorting Carlos to class between third and fourth period, I finally gather up enough nerve to ask, \u201cDo you want to come over after school?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows go up. \u201cYou askin\u2019 me out?\u201d</p><p>I grit my teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2019cause you\u2019re not my type. I like my women sexy and stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my type, either,\u201d I snap back. \u201cI like my guys smart and funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m funny.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just too smart to get your jokes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you want me to come over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom . . . made cookies.\u201d I cringe after the words leave my mouth. Who invites a guy over for cookies? Maybe my brother does, but he\u2019s in kindergarten. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019ll be a date or anything,\u201d I blurt out in case he thinks I\u2019m secretly trying to hit on him. \u201cJust . . . cookies.\u201d</p><p>I wish I could rewind this entire conversation, but there\u2019s no going back now.</p><p>We reach the door to his classroom, and he still hasn\u2019t answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he says, then leaves me out in the hall by myself.</p><p>He\u2019ll think about it? As if coming over to my house would be doing me a huge favor instead of the other way around?</p><p>At our lockers at the end of the day, when I hope he\u2019s forgotten I even asked him over, he leans his weight on one foot and stuffs his hands in his front pockets. \u201cWhat kind of cookies?\u201d</p><p>Out of all the questions in the world, why did he have to ask that one?</p><p>\u201cOrange,\u201d I say. \u201cOrange marmalade.\u201d</p><p>He leans closer, as if I didn\u2019t say it loud enough or clear enough. \u201cOrange what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarmalade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarmalade.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s just no cool way to say the word \u201cmarmalade,\u201d and all those m\u2019s so close together make me sound goofy. At least I didn\u2019t stutter.</p><p>He nods. I can tell he\u2019s trying to keep a straight face, but he can\u2019t. He bursts out laughing. \u201cCan you say it one more time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can make fun of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. It\u2019s become the only thing I look forward to in life. Just so happens you\u2019re an easy target.\u201d</p><p>I slam my locker door shut. \u201cConsider yourself officially uninvited.\u201d I walk away, but then remember that I\u2019ve left all my homework in my locker and have to open it again. I quickly grab the three books I need, shove them in my backpack, and head out.</p><p>\u201cIf they were double-chocolate chip, I would have come,\u201d he calls after me, then laughs.</p><p>Tuck is waiting for me in the senior parking lot. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was arguing with Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain? Listen, Kiara, it\u2019s only Tuesday. You\u2019ve got three more days with him. Why don\u2019t you quit being his peer guide and be done with the misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s just what he wants,\u201d I say as we get in my car and I drive out of the lot. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give him the satisfaction of one-upping me all the time. He\u2019s so obnoxious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s got to be something you can do to make him eat his words.\u201d</p><p>Tuck\u2019s words spark the perfect idea. \u201cThat\u2019s it! Tuck, you\u2019re a genius,\u201d I say excitedly. I make a sharp U-turn.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Tuck asks, then points behind us. \u201cYour house is that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst we\u2019re stopping at the grocery store and McGuckin\u2019s Hardware. I need the ingredients for double-chocolate chip cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you bake,\u201d Tuck asks. \u201cAnd why double-chocolate chip cookies?\u201d</p><p>I flash him a mischievous smile. \u201cI\u2019m going to use them to make Carlos eat his words.\u201d</p><p>5</p><p>Carlos</p><p>On Wednesday, I walk out of school and head over to the body shop to meet Alex. Just as I cross the street, a red Mustang pulls up beside me. Madison Stone is driving, her windows wide open. When I get closer she asks where I\u2019m goin\u2019.</p><p>\u201cMcConnell\u2019s\u2014the place where my brother works,\u201d I tell her. He said I could help him to make some extra cash.</p><p>\u201cHop in. I\u2019ll drive you.\u201d</p><p>Madison orders her friend Lacey into the backseat and tells me to sit in front, next to her. I\u2019ve never lived in a place where you\u2019re not judged by the color of your skin or your parents\u2019 bank accounts, so I\u2019m wary of Madison\u2019s immediate interest in me. Hell, I put on the charm for Kiara before Heavy Shevy\u2019s class and she didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash or attempt to loosen those pursed lips. All I got was a disgusted gasp. Although yesterday she invited me over for cookies. Orange-marmalade cookies. Who the hell invites someone over for orange-marmalade cookies? The funniest part about it was that I think she was serious. Today she walked me from class to class without saying a damn word to me. I even tried to goad her into talkin\u2019 by making fun of her, but she refused to take the bait.</p><p>Madison punches in the address to McConnell\u2019s on her GPS.</p><p>\u201cSo, Carlos,\u201d Lacey says, leaning between the seats as Madison starts driving. She taps me on the shoulder as if I didn\u2019t hear her. \u201cIs it true you got expelled from your last school for beating someone up?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve only been in school three days, and already people are talkin\u2019. \u201cActually it was three guys and a pit bull,\u201d I joke, but I think she takes me seriously because her mouth opens in shock.</p><p>\u201cWow!\u201d She taps me again. \u201cThey allow dogs in school in Mexico?\u201d</p><p>Lacey is dumber than a beanless burrito. \u201cOh, yeah. Pit bulls and Chihuahuas only, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be great if I could bring Puddles to school!\u201d She taps me on the shoulder again. I\u2019m tempted to tap her back a ton of times so she knows how annoying it is. \u201cPuddles is my Labradoodle.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is a Labradoodle? whatever it is, I bet my cousin Lana\u2019s pit bull could eat Puddles the Labradoodle for lunch.</p><p>\u201cSo is your brother the guy who brought you to school on Monday when you registered?\u201d Madison asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer as we pull into the parking lot of the auto body.</p><p>\u201cMy friend Gina told me she saw the two of you in the office. Were your parents out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live with my brother. The rest of my family is back in Mexico.\u201d No need to go into my whole life story about how my father died in a drug deal when I was four and how mi'am\u00e1 practically kicked me out and shipped me here.</p><p>Madison looks shocked. \u201cYou live with your brother? No parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky,\u201d Lacey says. \u201cMy parents are around all the time, and my sister is a complete psycho, but I escape to Madison\u2019s most days because she\u2019s an only child and her p\u2019s are never home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Madison is looking in her rearview mirror. At the mention of her parents, she stills for the slightest moment before smiling again. \u201cThey\u2019re always traveling,\u201d she explains while reapplying more of that shiny lip gloss. \u201cBut I like it, because I can do whatever I want with whoever I want without any rules.\u201d</p><p>Considering my life has been full of people tryin\u2019 to rule it, her life sounds bueno to me.</p><p>\u201cOmigod, you and your brother look like twins,\u201d Lacey says as Alex approaches the Mustang.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the resemblance,\u201d I tell her as I open the door. Madison and Lacey get out, too. Do they expect an introduction? They stand in front of me with their flawless pale skin and their makeup sparkling in the sun. \u201cThanks for the ride,\u201d I say.</p> <p>They both hug me. Madison gives me an extra-long squeeze. It\u2019s definitely a sign that she\u2019s interested.</p><p>I can tell Alex isn\u2019t exactly sure what I\u2019m doin\u2019 with these two chicks. I drape my arms around Madison\u2019s and Lacey\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHey, Alex, this is Madison and Lacey. The two hottest chicks at Flatiron High.\u201d</p><p>Both girls nod at Alex and flash their bright smiles. They like the compliment, although I think they know they\u2019re smokin\u2019 and don\u2019t need to be reminded.</p><p>\u201cThanks for givin\u2019 my brother a ride,\u201d Alex says, then turns around and heads back inside.</p><p>After the girls drive off, I follow him into the shop and find him working on the front bumper cover of an SUV that\u2019s obviously been in an accident.</p> <p>\u201cYou the only one here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Help me remove this thing,\u201d he says as he tosses me a Phillips.</p><p>Alex and I used to work on cars together at my cousin Enrique\u2019s auto-body shop. It was one of the few things we did when we were actually tryin\u2019 to stay out of trouble. My brother and cousin taught me everythin\u2019 they knew about cars, and whatever they didn\u2019t teach me I figured out on my own when I took apart junkers in the back of the shop.</p><p>I get under the hood of the SUV and work on the inside screws. The sound of metal clinking on metal echoes through the shop and for a second I feel like we\u2019re back in Chicago at Enrique\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNice girls,\u201d my brother says sarcastically as we work side by side.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. I was thinkin\u2019 about askin\u2019 both of them to Homecoming.\u201d I shove the Phillips in my back pocket. \u201cOh, and before I forget to tell you, Kiara invited me over for cookies yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides the fact that I didn\u2019t want to, she uninvited me.\u201d</p><p>Alex turns his focus from the bumper to me. \u201cPlease tell me you weren\u2019t a complete pendejo to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just had a little fun, that\u2019s all. Next time you want to arrange an escort for me, make sure it\u2019s one who doesn\u2019t wear oversized shirts with stupid sayings on them. Kiara reminds me of a dude I knew back in Chicago, Alex. I\u2019m not even sure she\u2019s female.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to p-p-prove it?\u201d my ex\u2013peer guide\u2019s voice echoes from the doorway.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>6</p><p>Kiara</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carlos says, challenge and amusement written all over his face. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>Alex holds up a hand. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t.\u201d He shoves Carlos against the car and mutters something in Spanish. Carlos mutters something back. I have no clue what they\u2019re saying, but neither sounds happy.</p><p>I\u2019m not too happy either. I can\u2019t believe I just stuttered. I\u2019m so pissed at myself for letting Carlos get me so emotional I stumbled over my words. That means he has power over me, and that fact makes me angrier. I can\u2019t wait until Friday, when Operation Cookie will finally go into effect. I have to wait until the cookies are good and stale in order for it to work right. At least he won\u2019t be expecting it.</p><p>A frustrated Alex stomps away from Carlos and pulls a box from behind the cashier\u2019s desk. \u201cI tested your radio, and I think a spring is missin\u2019. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna work, but I\u2019d like to give it a try. Give me your keys and I\u2019ll pull your car in.\u201d He turns to Carlos. \u201cDon\u2019t say a word while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>The second after Alex leaves, Carlos says, \u201cSo if you still want to prove you\u2019re not a dude, I\u2019m game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes being a jerk make you feel better about yourself?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cNo. But pissin\u2019 off my brother does. And pissin\u2019 you off pisses my brother off. Sorry you\u2019re the one caught in the crossfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely to happen any time soon.\u201d Carlos crouches in front of the car they were working on and pulls on the bumper cover.</p><p>\u201cYou need to unhook the clips first,\u201d I tell him, pleased to prove that I know more about cars than he does. \u201cIt won\u2019t come off until you unhook the clips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talkin\u2019 bras or bumpers?\u201d he asks, then flashes me a cocky grin. \u201c \u2019Cause I\u2019m an expert at unhooking both.\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t have done it. It was immature. It was that sexy and stupid comment Carlos made. That, combined with him making fun of the way I say \u201cmarmalade,\u201d was what pushed me to make him eat his words.</p><p>It\u2019s Friday. Tuck and I came to school early this morning to rig Carlos\u2019s locker. Tuesday after school Tuck and I made over a hundred double-chocolate chip cookies. When they cooled off, we glued a small but powerful magnet to the back of each one. Now they\u2019re stale cookie magnets. When Carlos opens his locker this morning, the inside is going to be decorated with a hundred little cookie magnets.</p><p>When he tries to pull each magnet off, the cookie will break into pieces and crumble in his hand. I got superstrong little magnets the size of a dime. It\u2019ll be messy, that\u2019s for sure. So he\u2019ll have two options: keep the magnet cookies stuck inside his locker, or take them off one by one and be showered with little broken cookie pieces.</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to get in a fight with you,\u201d Tuck says as he acts as a lookout. School won\u2019t start for another forty-five minutes, so there are only a few people passing in the hallway.</p><p>I open Carlos\u2019s locker using the combination that was written on top of his schedule, which Mr. House gave to me. I feel guilty, but not guilty enough not to do it. I place a few cookies, then look at Tuck. He\u2019s on the lookout for Carlos or anyone else who might get suspicious. Each time I place a cookie, the clink of the magnet against metal makes Tuck laugh.</p><p>Clink. Clink. Clink. Clink. Clink. Clink.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to freak,\u201d Tuck says. \u201cHe\u2019ll know it was you, you know. When you punk someone, the goal is to do it anonymously so you don\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late now.\u201d I attach more magnet cookies, but wonder how I\u2019m going to get all one hundred of them inside. I\u2019m placing them on the top, back, inside door, sides . . . I\u2019m running out of space, but I\u2019m almost done. It looks like the inside of his locker has brown measles.</p><p>I reach into the bag. \u201cOnly one left.\u201d</p><p>Tuck peeks his head inside. \u201cThis could be one of the best pranks ever at Flatiron High, Kiara. You could go down in the history books. I\u2019m proud of you. Put the last one on the outside, right in the middle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d I close his locker before anyone catches us, attach the last cookie, then check my watch. Homeroom starts in twenty minutes. \u201cNow we wait.\u201d</p><p>Tuck looks down the hallway. \u201cPeople are coming. Shouldn\u2019t we hide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I have to see his reaction,\u201d I say. \u201cLet\u2019s hide in Mrs. Hadden\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Five minutes later, as Tuck and I peek through the square window in the door, Carlos comes walking down the hall.</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d I whisper. My heart is beating furiously in my chest.</p><p>His eyebrows furrow when he reaches his locker and sees a big brown cookie on it. He looks left and right, obviously looking for any sign of who did it. When he pulls the cookie off, it crumbles in his hand but leaves the magnet stuck to his locker.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his reaction?\u201d I ask Tuck, who\u2019s taller and has a better view.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s smiling. And shaking his head. Now he\u2019s tossing the crumbled cookie in the garbage.\u201d</p><p>Carlos won\u2019t be smiling when he opens his locker to find ninety-nine more cookie magnets.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out there,\u201d I tell Tuck. I emerge from the safety of Mrs. Hadden\u2019s room and walk to my locker as if nothing is out of the ordinary.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say to Carlos as he eyes his open locker with all the cookies.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you an A+ for originality and execution,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you I get good grades in everything, even pranks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He cocks a brow. \u201cI\u2019m impressed. I\u2019m pissed off, but impressed.\u201d He closes his locker, the ninety-nine cookies still attached to the inside. As if the cookies don\u2019t exist, we walk side by side to his first-period class.</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile while we walk down the hall. He shakes his head a few times, as if he can\u2019t believe what I did.</p><p>\u201cTruce?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You may have won this battle, but this war, chica, is far from over.\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Carlos</p><p>I can\u2019t get rid of the cookie smell. It\u2019s on my hands, it\u2019s in my books . . . hell, it\u2019s even in my backpack. I tried taking a few of them off my locker, but it was such a mess I gave up. I\u2019ll keep \u2019em in until they get really moldy . . . then I\u2019ll collect all the crumbs and shove them into Kiara\u2019s locker. Or better yet, superglue them to the inside.</p><p>I have to get my mind off cookies and Kiara. Nothing beats mi'am\u00e1\u2019s cookin\u2019, but as soon as I get home from school today I take whatever I can find in Alex\u2019s apartment and attempt to make us an authentic Mexican meal. It\u2019ll get me to stop thinking about those damn double-chocolate chip cookies. That, combined with the fact that I\u2019ve been here almost a week and have yet to eat authentic, spicy Mexican food, is drivin\u2019 me nuts.</p><p>Alex leans into the pot of stewed meat and inhales the scent. I can tell just by the expression on his face it reminds him of home.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called carne guisada. It\u2019s Mexican.\u201d I say the words slowly as if he\u2019s never heard of it.</p><p>\u201cI know what it is, smart-ass.\u201d He replaces the lid, then sets the table and goes back to studying.</p><p>We sit down to eat an hour later. I watch as my brother inhales his first serving and takes a second.</p><p>\u201cEat much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 as good as this.\u201d Alex licks his fork. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know a lot of things about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to.\u201d</p><p>I push around the food on my plate, suddenly not hungry. \u201cThat was a long time ago.\u201d I keep my eyes focused on my food. I don\u2019t even know my brother anymore. After he got shot, I guess I was afraid to talk to him because talkin\u2019 about it made it real. Alex never said what exactly happened when he got jumped out of the Latino Blood, and I never asked. But yesterday mornin\u2019 I got a clue. \u201cI saw your scars yesterday when you came out of the shower.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He stops eating and puts down his fork. \u201cI thought you were still sleepin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d The image of his badly scarred back, full of what looks like whip marks, is etched into my brain. When I noticed the bulging skin between his shoulder blades with the letters LB permanently branded into him like a head of cattle, my skin crawled with hateful anger and thoughts of revenge.</p><p>\u201cJust forget it,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen.\u201d Alex isn\u2019t the only Fuentes brother who feels a fierce protectiveness toward his family. If I go back to Chicago and find the asshole responsible for branding Alex\u2019s body, he\u2019s a dead man. I might rebel against mi familia, but they\u2019re still my blood.</p> <p>Alex isn\u2019t the only one with scars. I have more fights to my name than a professional boxer. Along with my scars, if Alex knew the tattoos on my back marked me a Guerrero, he\u2019d shit a brick. I might be in Colorado, but I\u2019m still connected.</p><p>\u201cBrittany and I are goin\u2019 to visit her sister Shelley tonight. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>I know Brittany\u2019s sister is disabled and staying in some assisted-living place near the university. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m goin\u2019 out,\u201d I tell Alex.</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I checked, our pap\u00e1 was dead. I don\u2019t have to answer to you.\u201d</p> <p>Alex and I stare each other down. He used to be able to kick my ass without even tryin\u2019, but not anymore. We\u2019re about to get into it again, but the door opens and Brittany walks in.</p><p>She must realize there\u2019s tension in the air, because her smile fades when she reaches the table. She puts her hand on Alex\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s perfecto. Right, Alex?\u201d I say, then pick up my plate and weave my way around her to get to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cNo. I asked him a simple question, and he can\u2019t even answer it,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>I swear that\u2019s something that should only come out of a parent\u2019s mouth. I let out a frustrated sigh. \u201cI\u2019m just goin\u2019 to a party, Alex. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m goin\u2019 out to murder someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA party?\u201d Brittany asks.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Ever hear of the concept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it. I also know what goes on at parties.\u201d She sits next to Alex. \u201cWe went to parties in high school, though we learned from our mistakes, and he\u2019ll learn from his. You can\u2019t stop him from going out,\u201d she tells my brother.</p><p>Alex points to me accusingly. \u201cYou should see those girls he was hangin\u2019 with the other day, Brittany. They\u2019ve got that psycho Darlene written all over them. Remember her? That girl would have screwed the entire football team back in high school if it would have upped her popularity status.\u201d</p><p>Once again my brother isn\u2019t helping my cause. Thanks, bro.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was nice listenin\u2019 to both of you discuss my life in front of me, but I\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you gettin\u2019 there?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>\u201cWalkin\u2019. Unless . . .\u201d I eye Brittany\u2019s keys lying on top of her purse.</p><p>\u201cHe can use my car,\u201d she says to my brother. She doesn\u2019t say it to me, because God forbid either my brother or she make a decision without the other one\u2019s approval. \u201cBut no drinking. Or drugs.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Mom,\u201d I say sarcastically.</p><p>Alex shakes his head. \u201cNot a good idea.\u201d</p><p>She weaves her fingers through his. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Alex. Really. We were going to take the bus to visit my sister anyway.\u201d</p><p>For a nanosecond I like my brother\u2019s girlfriend, but then I remember how she controls his life, and that warm and fuzzy feeling disappears as fast as a streak of lightning.</p><p>I pick up Brittany\u2019s keys and twirl them in my hand. \u201cCome on, Alex. Don\u2019t make my shitty life worse than it already is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cBut bring that car back in perfect condition. Or else.\u201d</p><p>I salute him. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He pulls his cell phone out of his back pocket and tosses it to me. \u201cAnd take this.\u201d</p><p>Before either of them can change their mind, I head out the door. I forgot to ask where her car is parked, but it\u2019s not hard to spot. The Beemer shines like an angel in front of the apartment building, calling to me.</p><p>I reach into my back pocket and pull out a sheet of paper with Madison\u2019s address on it. I wrote it down before I washed off my arm. After I figure out how to use the thing, I enter the address into the GPS, put the top down, and screech out of the parking lot. Finally . . . freedom.</p><p>I park on the street and walk up the long driveway to Madison\u2019s house. I know I have the right address because music is blarin\u2019 out of the second-story window and kids are hangin\u2019 out on the front lawn. The house is huge. At first I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s one house or an entire apartment building until I get close and see that it\u2019s just one big mansion. I step inside the monstrosity and recognize a bunch of kids from my classes.</p><p>\u201cCarlos is here!\u201d a girl screeches. I pretend not to hear the echo of squeals that follow.</p><p>Madison, wearing a short clingy black dress and carryin\u2019 a can of Bud Light in her hand, weaves through the crowd and gives me a hug. I think she spilled beer on my back. \u201cOmigod, you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to set you up. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>I follow her to a kitchen that looks like it came out of a magazine. It has stainless-steel appliances. Big granite slabs line the top of the counters. Next to the sink is a huge bin stuffed to the rim with ice and cans of beer. I reach in and grab one.</p><p>\u201cIs Kiara here?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Madison snorts. \u201cAs if.\u201d</p><p>I guess that\u2019s my answer.</p><p>Madison wraps her hand around my elbow and leads me down a hallway and up a flight of stairs. \u201cI have someone you have to meet.\u201d She stops when we reach a room off to the side, filled with five huge vintage arcade games, a pool table, and an air-hockey table.</p><p>It\u2019s a teen guy\u2019s dream.</p><p>It also reeks of pot. I think I\u2019m gettin\u2019 high just by inhalin\u2019 the air.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the rec room,\u201d Madison explains.</p><p>I\u2019m sure it takes the definition of \u201crecreation room\u201d to a whole different level.</p><p>A white guy is sitting on a brown leather couch, leaning back as if he\u2019s content to stay in that position forever. He\u2019s wearing a plain white T-shirt and black jeans and boots. I can tell he thinks he\u2019s one cool dude. On a small table in front of him is a bong.</p><p>\u201cCarlos, this is Nick,\u201d Madison says.</p><p>Nick nods to me.</p><p>I nod back. \u201c \u2019Sup.\u201d</p><p>Madison sits next to Nick, picks up the bong and a lighter lying next to it, and takes a really long hit. Damn, that girl can inhale.</p><p>\u201cNick wanted to meet you,\u201d she tells me. I notice her eyes are bloodshot. I wonder how many hits she took before I got here.</p><p>Lacey peeks her head in. \u201cMadison, I need you!\u201d she screeches. \u201cCome here!\u201d</p><p>Madison tells us she\u2019ll be right back and stumbles out of the room.</p><p>Nick waves me to the couch beside him. \u201cTake a seat.\u201d</p><p>The guy is too slick, and my radar goes up. I know his game, because I\u2019ve seen a hundred Nicks in my lifetime. Hell, I was a \u201cNick\u201d back in Mexico.</p><p>\u201cYou dealin\u2019 the stuff ?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cIf you\u2019re buyin\u2019 it, I\u2019m dealin\u2019 it.\u201d He holds out the bong. \u201cWant a hit?\u201d</p><p>I hold up the can of beer in my hand. \u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>He narrows his eyes at me. \u201cYou\u2019re not a narc, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a narc?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cYou never know. Narcs come in all different shapes and sizes these days.\u201d</p><p>I immediately think of Kiara. She\u2019s definitely become my daily entertainment. I try and peg her reactions every time I do my best to piss her off. Her rose-colored lips tighten into a thin line every time I make an outrageous comment or flirt with a girl. No matter what I told her, and no matter how many cookie crumbs are scattered on the inside of my locker, I\u2019m gonna miss havin\u2019 her as my peer guide.</p><p>I haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m gonna do to get back at her for the cookie stunt. whatever it is, she\u2019ll never see it comin\u2019.</p><p>\u201cI hear Madison wants to get into your pants,\u201d Nick says as he pulls out a bag of pills from his front pocket. He spills them out on the table.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Madison. And you know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He pops a little blue pill into his mouth and throws back his head to swallow it. \u201cUsually what Madison wants, Madison gets.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>Kiara</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m color-blind,\u201d Mr. Whittaker complains in a cranky, scratchy voice as he dips a paintbrush into a cup of brown paint and swipes it on the canvas. \u201cIs this green? How am I supposed to paint anything when these colors aren\u2019t labeled?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s never a dull moment during art class at The Highlands Long-Term Health Care Facility, otherwise known as a nursing home. The regular art teacher quit, but since I was volunteering to help during art hour I just kind of took over the class. The administration supplies the paint, and I come up with subjects for those who want a painting activity after dinner on Friday nights.</p><p>As I rush over to Mr. Whittaker, a little old lady with stark white hair named Sylvia comes shuffling over to us. \u201cHe\u2019s not color-blind,\u201d Sylvia croaks out as she finds an empty easel and sits down. \u201cHe\u2019s just plain ol\u2019 blind.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Whittaker looks up at me with his thin, weathered face as I kneel beside him and label the colors with a thick, black marker. \u201cShe\u2019s just sore because I wouldn\u2019t dance with her at the social last week,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sore because you forgot to put your teeth in at dinner yesterday.\u201d She waves her hand in the air. \u201cHe was all gums. Some Casanova you are,\u201d she says in a huff.</p><p>\u201cHussy,\u201d Mr. Whittaker growls.</p><p>\u201cNext time maybe you should dance with her at the social,\u201d I say. \u201cMake her feel young again.\u201d</p><p>He reaches up with calloused, arthritic fingers and pulls me closer. \u201cI\u2019ve got two left feet. But don\u2019t tell Sylvia that, because she\u2019ll give me a hard time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they have dance lessons here?\u201d I whisper right into his ear, loud enough so he can hear but the rest of the class can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI can hardly walk. A Fred Astaire I\u2019ll never be. Now, if you were the dance teacher instead of that old bat Frieda Fitzgibbons, I\u2019d definitely start coming to lessons.\u201d He waggles his overgrown white eyebrows at me and pats me on the butt.</p><p>I shake my finger at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t anyone tell you that\u2019s sexual harassment?\u201d I tease.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a dirty old man, honey. In my day there was no such thing as sexual harassment and women actually let men buy them sodas and open doors for them . . . and pinch their butts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let guys open doors for me, just as long as they don\u2019t expect any favors in return. I could do without the butt-patting and pinching, though.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shoos me away. \u201cAch, you girls today want it all . . . and then some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Kiara,\u201d Sylvia says, waving me over. \u201cWhat you want is a nice boy . . . a real gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no such things,\u201d Mildred says next to her.</p><p>A nice boy. I thought Michael was nice, and he couldn\u2019t even dump me like a gentleman. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll just stay single for the rest of my life.\u201d</p> <p>Both Mildred and Sylvia shake their heads vigorously, their wispy white hair flying from side to side. \u201cNo!\u201d they both say.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want that,\u201d Sylvia says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d She looks over at Mr. Whittaker. \u201cBecause we need them . . . even if they are the devil incarnate.\u201d She motions me closer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind if he patted my butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that, sister,\u201d Mildred says as she swipes her brush on the canvas. She\u2019s painting a silhouette that looks suspiciously like a nude man. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask that nice boy Tuck to come and pose for us? You said we can do live subjects.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking of a dog,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cNo. Get us a male model.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drawing some guy,\u201d Mr. Whittaker yells from across the room. \u201cKiara will have to model, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not promising anything,\u201d I tell the class. Wait until I call Tuck today and ask him to be a male model for my class. I think he might just go along with it.</p><p>9</p><p>Carlos</p> <p>\u201cHeeeey,\u201d Madison sings. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019s brought about ten other people with her. They all gather by the bong and pass it around, each takin\u2019 hits. I wonder what Kiara and her friends are doin\u2019 tonight. I bet she\u2019s studying for her SATs or something like that, so she can get into a good college, while I\u2019m at a bong-and-little-blue-pill party.</p><p>Nick lines up the pills on a tray. It reminds me of what Alex called a pu-pu platter.</p><p>When Madison passes the bong to me with a big smile, I want to forget about Kiara and SATs and college and bein\u2019 good. I\u2019m a thug, so I better start actin\u2019 like one.</p><p>I take a hit, inhaling the sweet smoke into my lungs. The stuff is definitely potent, because I feel the effects before I even hand the bong to the person next to me. When it comes back around, this time I take a long, slow hit. By the fourth time, I\u2019m stoned enough not to care about Kiara and her cookies or Alex gettin\u2019 on my case all the time, or the fact that I lied to Brittany when I promised I wouldn\u2019t drink or do drugs tonight.</p><p>Right now I only want to think about life\u2019s burning questions, like . . . \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Heavy Shevy shave her mustache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s a man in disguise,\u201d Nick says.</p><p>\u201cBut why would he choose an ugly woman as a disguise?\u201d I ask. Seriously.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s an ugly man and has no other choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense.\u201d I watch Madison take another hit. She sees me watching her, then smiles at me as she wiggles her way onto my lap and licks her lips. By the length and pointy tip of her tongue I think she might have iguana genes in her family tree. She leans forward, her chichis inches from my face.</p><p>\u201cNick has the best shit,\u201d she coos, leanin\u2019 back and stretching on me like a cat on a rug. Needless to say, I\u2019m the rug. She twists herself around, straddles me, and wraps both arms around my neck. Her eyes are at half-mast. \u201cYou\u2019re sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a perfect match.\u201d She traces my chin with her finger and leans forward. That iguana tongue of hers sneaks out and her body starts writhing against mine. She licks my chin, which I have to admit no girl has ever done to me before. I\u2019m not too keen on having this girl do it a second time, either.</p><p>We start makin\u2019 out in front of everyone. I think Madison likes the spotlight, \u2019cause when one of the girls makes a comment to one of the guys to stop watching, Madison leans back and starts pullin\u2019 up her shirt like she\u2019s a stripper at a club givin\u2019 me a lap dance. It\u2019s obvious Madison wants to be watched and admired by all the guys, and envied by all the girls.</p><p>This girl is definitely an exhibitionist, but when I look to my left and find Nick making out with a shirtless Lacey I start to wonder if everyone is expected to show off their sexual talents in public here.</p><p>That\u2019s not me. \u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere private,\u201d I tell Madison as she reaches down to feel me over my jeans.</p><p>She pouts for a minute, then wiggles her way off my lap and holds out her hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>The night is moving way too fast. I\u2019d rather chill, and in the back of my mind I remember Ram warned me about Madison, but she grabs my hand and pulls me up.</p><p>\u201cHave fun, you two,\u201d Nick calls out.</p><p>Two minutes later we enter a huge room with a king-size bed against the wall.</p><p>\u201cYour room?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Madison shakes her head. \u201cIt\u2019s my parents\u2019, but they\u2019re hardly home. Right now they\u2019re in Phoenix.\u201d I sense traces of bitterness in her voice, and I\u2019m sure foolin\u2019 around on their bed is her revenge.</p><p>Should I tell her I\u2019d rather do this on the floor instead of her parents\u2019 bed?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to your room,\u201d I say.</p><p>She shakes her head, then pulls me closer to the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Ram say about me?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to think about that right now,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m as baked as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust try and remember. Did he mention why we broke up? Because if he did, it wasn\u2019t all my fault. I mean, it\u2019s not like I knew what he knew and that I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. And if I did know, it wasn\u2019t because I knew that he knew. It\u2019s not like his mother would have found out and have us all arrested.\u201d</p><p>My head aches from listenin\u2019 to her. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. I have no clue what she just said, but I figure a response of \u201cokay\u201d might cover the bases. One can only hope.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she says, smiling.</p><p>Huh? I have no fuckin\u2019 clue what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. Or what she\u2019s talkin\u2019 about.</p><p>She hugs me tight, her chichis pressed hard against my chest. I hope they don\u2019t burst from the pressure of being squished against me.</p><p>Thoughts of bursting chichis are creepin\u2019 me out. And my mind wanders to thoughts of Kiara and what she looks like under those huge shirts. For a second I think the unknown of Kiara\u2019s body is sexier than what Madison flaunts every day.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut. What am I thinkin\u2019? Kiara isn\u2019t sexy. She\u2019s frustrating and challenges me more than my own family.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you what Kiara did to my locker?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She urges me onto the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about Kiara. Stop talking about another girl when you\u2019re here with me.\u201d She\u2019s right. I need to stop talking about Kiara. I like things that come easily to me, and Kiara isn\u2019t one of them. Madison is.</p><p>Before I know it, we\u2019re gettin\u2019 hot and heavy on her parents\u2019 bed. She\u2019s sitting on me, her hair in my face. I think some of her hair is in our mouths as we\u2019re kissing, but she doesn\u2019t seem to notice. I do.</p><p>She leans back. \u201cWanna do it?\u201d she slurs.</p><p>Sure I want to do it. But when I look to the side and see a picture of her parents smiling at us from one of the nightstands, it hits me. She doesn\u2019t want me because I\u2019m me\u2014she wants me because I\u2019m a drugged-out thug, the exact opposite of who her parents want her to be with.</p><p>But tellin\u2019 myself I\u2019m a thug is one thing. Actin\u2019 like one is another. \u201cI gotta go,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWait. Oh, no. I\u2019m not feeling well. I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p>She pushes herself up and runs to the bathroom, locking herself in. The sounds of gagging and puking echo through the room a second later.</p><p>I knock on the door. \u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the door, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Get Lacey.\u201d</p><p>When I do, Lacey and a bunch of other girls rush in the room to help. I\u2019m standing in the doorway, watching them treat Madison like she\u2019s really sick instead of puking from getting drunk and stoned.</p><p>After twenty minutes of standing around being ignored, and confident that Madison is having her every need taken care of, I figure I\u2019ve had enough of this party.</p><p>Outside, I pull out Brittany\u2019s pink heart keychain. I rev the engine and put the car in drive, but when I look up and the lines on the road are blurry I know I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m too stoned, too drunk, or a mixture of both.</p><p>Shit. I have two options. Go back in Madison\u2019s house and find a place to crash, or sleep in the car.</p><p>It\u2019s not even a contest.</p><p>I push the button to recline the seat and close my eyes, hopin\u2019 tomorrow I can figure out what actually happened tonight.</p><p>Bright. It\u2019s too bright. I open my eyes to the morning sun hittin\u2019 me right in the face. I\u2019m still in Brittany\u2019s car. With the top down. When I get back to Alex\u2019s place, I find him sitting at the table with a mug of coffee in his hands.</p><p>He stands when I toss Brittany\u2019s keys on the table.</p><p>\u201cYou told me you\u2019d be home in a couple of hours. Are you aware it\u2019s nine? De la ma\u00f1ana.\u201d</p><p>I rub my palms over my eyes. \u201cPlease, Alex,\u201d I moan. \u201cCan you wait until at least noon to yell at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna yell at you. I\u2019m just not gonna let you drive Brittany\u2019s car again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I notice the air mattress is still set up. I fall onto it and close my eyes.</p><p>Alex pulls the pillow out from under my head. \u201cAre you high?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore, unfortunately.\u201d I grab the pillow back.</p><p>I hear my brother sit on his bed and let out a heavy sigh. Poor guy probably needs to smoke some weed to relax. I swear I can feel his eyes boring into my skull like two little lasers.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I mumble into my pillow.</p><p>\u201cDo you not fuckin\u2019 care about anyone but yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you realize I would worry about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. That thought didn\u2019t cross my mind even once.\u201d</p><p>Someone knocking on the door thankfully stops him from askin\u2019 me more questions.</p><p>I hear my brother say, \u201cHey, chica.\u201d</p><p>Let me guess\u2014 it\u2019s Brittany.</p><p>\u201cCarlos forgot to put my top up,\u201d she tells Alex. \u201cAnd it\u2019s starting to rain. He left your phone in the passenger seat. I hope it still works.\u201d</p><p>If they ever get married, I feel sorry for their kids. I hope those ni\u00f1os never fuck up . . . because Brittany and Alex are both lookin\u2019 at me as if they want to ground me for life.</p><p>Too bad for them, they\u2019re not my parents.</p><p>10</p><p>Kiara</p><p>On Monday, rumors are flying about Madison Stone\u2019s party. Most of them revolve around Madison and Carlos getting it on in her parents\u2019 bed.</p><p>On Tuesday and Wednesday, I notice Madison sitting with Carlos at his lunch table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On Thursday, Carlos isn\u2019t even at lunch. Neither is Madison. The happy couple must be off by themselves somewhere.</p><p>On Friday morning, Carlos is at his locker, the cookies still stuck on the inside. \u201cHey,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say back.</p><p>I enter my combination, but the locker won\u2019t open.</p> <p>I try again. I know I have the numbers right, but when I pull the handle, it doesn\u2019t budge.</p><p>I try again.</p><p>Carlos is looking over my shoulder. \u201cHavin\u2019 trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I try again.

Again, nothing happens.</p> <p>He taps his fingers on the metal. \u201cMaybe you forgot the combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my combination,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? \u2019Cause that\u2019s a turn-on.\u201d</p><p>My thoughts turn to the rumors about him and Madison. I don\u2019t even know why, but the idea of them hooking up fuels my anger. \u201cJust go away.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d The first bell rings. \u201cWell, good luck. If you ask me, it looks like someone rigged it.\u201d He grabs his books out of his locker and struts down the hallway.</p><p>I run after him and grab his arm. \u201cWhat did you do to my locker?\u201d</p> <p>He stops. \u201cI might have changed the combination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cIf I tell you, then I\u2019d have to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. Tell me what you changed it to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will totally give you that information . . .\u201d He taps the tip of his forefinger on my nose. \u201cWhen every last cookie is out of my locker. Includin\u2019 all the crumbs. See ya,\u201d he says, ducking into the classroom and leaving me alone in the hallway to figure out how I\u2019m going to do it . . . and then plot my next move.</p><p>In English class, Mr. Furie hands back our essays. He calls out our names and one by one we have to go up to his desk.</p><p>\u201cKiara,\u201d he calls out.</p><p>I walk up to get my paper. When Mr. Furie hands it to me, he\u2019s not smiling. \u201cYou can do a lot better than this, Kiara. I know you can. Dig deeper next time, and don\u2019t try to give me the answer you think I want.\u201d</p> <p>I pass Madison on the way back to my desk. \u201cHow\u2019s Carlos?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he only pays attention to you because he feels sorry for you. It\u2019s kind of sad, if you think about it.\u201d</p><p>I ignore her and sit at my desk. A big, red C is written on the front of the paper Mr. Furie just gave back to me. Not good, especially if I\u2019m going to apply for an academic scholarship.</p><p>\u201cFor the next fifteen minutes, you\u2019re going to write a persuasion paper,\u201d Mr. Furie says.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Nick Glass asks.</p><p>\u201cThe topic is . . .\u201d Mr. Furie pauses, obviously to heighten the anticipation and get the attention of all the students. He sits on the edge of his desk and says, \u201cShould people on reality shows be considered celebrities?\u201d</p><p>The class starts buzzing about the topic.</p><p>\u201cKeep the noise level to a minimum, people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can we write a persuasion paper when we don\u2019t have time to do research?\u201d someone in the back of the class asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for your thoughts, not research. When you\u2019re talking with a friend and you need to persuade him to do something, or to change his opinion, you can\u2019t say, \u2018Hold on, I need to do research or write down statistics.\u2019 You just come up with arguments off the top of your head. That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you to do.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Furie wanders around the room as we write. \u201cIf you want extra credit, you can read the paper aloud to the class.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s good. I need extra credit, and I know I can say my speech without stuttering. I just know I can.</p><p>\u201cPens down,\u201d Mr. Furie orders fifteen minutes later. He clasps his hands together. \u201cOkay, any volunteers to read first?\u201d</p><p>I raise my hand high.</p><p>\u201cMs. Westford, come on up and share your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Not her,\u201d I hear Madison groan beside me. Lacey laughs, along with a bunch of their friends.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a problem, Madison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Furie. I almost broke a nail!\u201d She wiggles her manicured fingers at him.</p><p>\u201cPlease save your nail issues for after class. Kiara, come on up.\u201d</p><p>I pick up my paper and walk to the front of the class. I tell myself to take deep breaths and think about the words before they come out of my mouth. When I\u2019m standing in front, I look over at my teacher. He\u2019s smiling warmly at me. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat. And swallow, but feel my tongue getting thicker before I even start talking, because of Madison. She\u2019s thrown me off, but I can overcome it. I don\u2019t have to give her power over my stuttering. Relax. Think about the words. Don\u2019t forget to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI th-th-think . . .\u201d I stare down at my paper. I can feel all eyes on me. Some are probably giving me the pity stare. Others, like Madison and Lacey, probably look amused. \u201cI th-th-think that p-p-people on r-r-reality shows . . .\u201d</p><p>A burst of laughter erupts from one girl. I know who it is before I look up.</p><p>\u201cMadison, I don\u2019t find this funny. Be respectful to your classmate,\u201d Mr. Furie says, then adds, \u201cThat\u2019s not a request. That\u2019s an order.\u201d</p><p>Madison puts her hand over her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d she says through her fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be,\u201d Mr. Furie says in his stern voice. \u201cGo ahead, Kiara. Continue.\u201d</p><p>Okay. I can do this. If I can talk to Tuck and not stutter, maybe I should just pretend I\u2019m talking to Tuck. I look up at my best friend. He gives me a small wave of encouragement from his seat in the back of the room.</p><p>\u201c. . . people on reality shows are celebrities . . .\u201d I pause and take a deep breath, then continue. I can do this. I can do this. \u201c. . . because we let the m-m-media\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another burst of laughter echoes in the room, this time from both Lacey and Madison.</p><p>\u201cMiss Stone and Miss Goebbert!\u201d Mr. Furie points toward the door. \u201cOut of my class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious,\u201d Madison argues.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more serious. And I\u2019m also giving you and Miss Goebbert three days of after-school detention starting today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d I whisper to Mr. Furie, hoping no one else can hear me. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Madison gets a shocked look on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re giving us detentions for laughing? Come on, Mr. Furie. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell it to Principal House if you have a problem with my punishment.\u201d Mr. Furie opens the top drawer of his desk and pulls out two blue detention slips. He fills out both and motions for Madison and Lacey to come get them. Both girls shoot me a furious look. Oh, no, this is not good. Now I\u2019m on Madison\u2019s radar, and I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any way I can get off it.</p><p>When he hands them the blue slips, Madison shoves hers in her purse. \u201cI can\u2019t have detention after school. I have to work at my mom\u2019s boutique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought about that before you disrupted my class. Now, both of you, apologize to Kiara,\u201d our teacher orders.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I mumble. \u201cYou d-d-don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I insist. We\u2019re s-s-s-s-sorry,\u201d Madison says, and suddenly Madison and Lacey start giggling again. Even after they hurry out the door, I can hear their laughter echoing as they walk down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI apologize on their behalf for their inappropriate behavior, Kiara,\u201d Mr. Furie says. \u201cWould you still like to share your paper?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and he sighs, but he doesn\u2019t argue when I return to my desk. I wish the bell would ring so I could go to the girls\u2019 bathroom and hide. I\u2019m so mad at myself for letting them affect me.</p><p>For the next twenty-five minutes, Mr. Furie calls on other students to read their persuasion papers. I keep looking up at the clock, praying for the minutes to go by faster. It\u2019s hard holding back tears that are threatening to pour out any minute.</p><p>As soon as the bell rings, I grab my books and practically sprint out of class. Mr. Furie calls my name, but I pretend not to hear him.</p><p>\u201cKiara!\u201d Tuck says, grabbing my elbow and spinning me around.</p><p>A stupid tear falls down my face. \u201cI want to be alone,\u201d I choke out, then run down the hall.</p><p>At the end of the corridor, there are stairs that lead to a vacant locker room rival teams use during tournaments. Nobody uses it during the day, and just the thought of being alone where I don\u2019t have to put on a fake smile sounds like heaven right now. I\u2019m aware I\u2019ll be late for study hall, but Mrs. Hadden doesn\u2019t usually take attendance and even if she does, I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want everyone to see me an emotional mess.</p><p>I push open the locker room door and sink onto one of the benches. All the energy I used during the last half of English class to stop myself from losing it rushes out of me. I wish I could be stronger and not care what people think, but I do. I\u2019m not strong like Tuck. I\u2019m not strong like Madison.</p><p>I wish I was content just being me, Kiara Westford, speech issues and all.</p><p>Fifteen minutes pass before I walk to the sink and look at my reflection in the mirror. I look like I\u2019ve been crying. That, or I have a very bad cold. I wet paper towels and dab them on my eyes, attempting to erase the puffiness. After a few minutes, I think I look halfway decent. Nobody will know I\u2019ve just been crying. I hope.</p><p>The door to the locker room opens, startling me.</p><p>\u201cAnybody here?\u201d one of the janitors yells out.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get to class because the police are here. They\u2019re doing a drug search.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>Carlos</p><p>In bio, Shevelenko finishes a lecture on dominant and recessive genes. She has us draw square boxes and tells us to write different scenarios about eye-color traits in the offspring of humans.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m havin\u2019 a couple guys over tonight,\u201d Ram says as we work. \u201cYou wanna come?\u201d</p><p>Even though Ram is a rich kid, he\u2019s pretty cool. The past week he\u2019s given me notes from the first two weeks of school, and his stories about going skiing last winter are hilarious.</p><p>\u201c\u00bfA qu\u00e9 hora?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cAround six or so.\u201d He rips out a piece of paper from his notebook and starts writing on it. \u201cHere\u2019s my address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a car. Is it far?\u201d</p><p>He turns the paper over and hands me his pen. \u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll just pick you up. Where do you live?\u201d</p><p>As I write down Alex\u2019s address, Shevelenko walks over to our table. \u201cCarlos, did you get all the notes from Ramiro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because there\u2019s a test next week.\u201d She\u2019s handing out worksheets when five beeps echo over the loudspeaker.</p><p>The entire room seems to gasp at once.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I question.</p><p>Ram looks shocked. \u201cHoly shit, man. We\u2019re in lockdown.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018lockdown\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s some psycho with a gun, I\u2019m jumping out the window,\u201d another student named John says. \u201cYou guys with me?\u201d</p><p>Ram rolls his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not someone with a gun, dude. That would be three long beeps instead of five short ones. This is a drug lockdown. It must not be routine, \u2019cause I haven\u2019t heard anything about it.\u201d</p><p>John seems amused. \u201cCall your mom, Ram. Ask if she knows what\u2019s up.\u201d</p> <p>Drug lockdown? I sure hope Nick Glass doesn\u2019t bring his pu-pu platter of drugs to school with him. I look over at Madison, who came late to class. She pulls her phone from her purse and starts texting someone underneath the lab table.</p><p>\u201cEveryone calm down,\u201d Shevelenko says. \u201cMost of you have been through this before. In case you haven\u2019t guessed it, we\u2019re in lockdown. No student can leave the building.\u201d</p><p>Madison raises her hand. \u201cCan I go to the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Madison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I really have to go! I promise I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLockdown rules state no wandering in the halls.\u201d Shevelenko glances at her computer. \u201cTake this time to study for the test next wednesday.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later a cop knocks on Shevelenko\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think got busted?\u201d a guy named Frank whispers as our teacher meets the officer outside the room.</p><p>Ram holds his hands up. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, man. I\u2019m not risking getting kicked off the soccer team. Besides, my mom would have me arrested herself if she found out I was doing illegal shit.\u201d</p><p>Shevelenko walks back in the room. \u201cCarlos Fuentes,\u201d she says loud and clear.</p><p>\u00a1Carajo! She called my name. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, you are so busted,\u201d Frank says.</p><p>I walk up to Shevelenko, and all I can focus on is her mustache hairs moving up and down as she says, \u201cThere are some people who want to talk to you. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>I know everyone in my bio class knows why I\u2019ve been called out. Thing is, I don\u2019t have any drugs in my pockets or in my locker. Maybe they found out I came from Mexico and want to deport me, although I was born in Illinois and am an American citizen.</p><p>In the hallway two cops step toward me. \u201cAre you Carlos Fuentes?\u201d one of them asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you show us where your locker is?\u201d</p><p>My locker? I shrug. \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>I walk to my locker, the polic\u00eda following so close I can feel their breath on the back of my neck. I turn the corner down J Hall and see a K9 police dog barking at my locker. What the hell?</p><p>The dog is ordered to sit by its handler.</p><p>Mr. House is standing next to my locker.</p><p>\u201cCarlos, is this your assigned locker?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He makes a dramatic pause before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll only ask this once. Do you have drugs in your locker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t mind opening it, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I enter the combination and open the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those things?\u201d one of the cops asks as he points to Kiara\u2019s cookie magnets. He steps forward to take a closer look and the K9 dog goes nuts. He pokes one. \u201cThey\u2019re cookies,\u201d he says dumbly.</p><p>\u201cI think your dog is hungry,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>The second cop gives me a level stare. \u201cYou, be quiet. They\u2019re probably laced with drugs and you\u2019re selling them.\u201d</p><p>Laced cookies? Is he kiddin\u2019 me? They\u2019re fucking stale cookie magnets. I start to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny, punk?\u201d</p><p>I clear my throat and try to keep a straight face. \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you make those cookies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I lie, because it\u2019s none of their business who made them. \u201cBut you should probably not pull \u2019em off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Scared we\u2019ll find out what\u2019s in them?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo. Trust me, they\u2019re not laced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d the cop says.</p><p>Ignoring me, the principal tries to pick off one of the cookie magnets. The cookie breaks in his hand. I cough again, trying to cover up another laugh, as he holds the crumbled brown pieces in his hand and sniffs them. I wonder what Kiara would think if she knew her cookies were under investigation.</p><p>One of the cops crumbles another cookie off and takes a small bite to see if he can taste traces of illegal substances. He shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t taste anything.\u201d He holds the rest of the cookie under the K9\u2019s nose. The dog goes still. \u201cThe cookies are clean,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s something else in the locker. Take everything out,\u201d he orders, then crosses his arms on his chest.</p><p>From the top shelf, I take out a couple of books and place them on the floor. I take more books out from the bottom. When I pull down my backpack, the dog starts freakin\u2019 out again.</p><p>That dog is certifiably nuts. If we watch it long enough, I\u2019m sure its head will turn around and its eyes will roll to the back of its head.</p><p>\u201cTake everything out of your backpack and place the items on the floor in front of you,\u201d House says.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I tell House. \u201cI have no clue why that dog is about to attack my backpack. I don\u2019t have drugs in there. Maybe the dog\u2019s got a disorder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dog isn\u2019t the problem, son,\u201d the K9 officer barks out.</p><p>My pulse races when the guy calls me \u201cson.\u201d I want to lash out at him, but he\u2019s got a psycho dog he can sic on me. While I think I\u2019m a hard-ass, I definitely know a trained psycho K9 can kick my ass.</p><p>One by one I pull out each thing from my backpack. I lay them out in a straight line.</p><p>One pencil.</p><p>Two pens.</p><p>One notebook.</p><p>One Spanish book.</p><p>One can of Coke.</p><p>The dog starts barking again. Wait, I didn\u2019t put a can of Coke in there. The principal picks up the can, starts unscrewing the top and . . . oh, shit. It\u2019s not a can of Coke. It\u2019s a fake one with . . .</p><p>One bag of weed. A big bag. And . . .</p><p>One bag with a bunch of white and blue pills inside.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not mine,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>\u201cWhose is it, then?\u201d the principal asks. \u201cGive us names.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s Nick\u2019s, but I\u2019m not about to rat on him. If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in Mexico, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t open your mouth. Ever. Even if I don\u2019t give a shit about Nick, I\u2019m about to take the fall whether I like it or not. \u201cI don\u2019t have any names. I\u2019ve only lived here a week, give me a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t give breaks. Not on school property, which makes this a felony,\u201d one of the officers says, eyeing my tattoos. He takes the bags from the principal, then opens the one with the pills. \u201cThis is Oxy-Contin. And this,\u201d he says, opening the bag with the weed, \u201cis enough marijuana for us to know you\u2019re not just smoking it, you\u2019re selling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what this means, Carlos?\u201d the principal asks.</p><p>Yeah, I know what it means. It means Alex is gonna kill me.</p><p>12</p><p>Kiara</p><p>When I found out Carlos got arrested, I immediately had the instinct to call my dad. He said he\u2019d call Alex and find out what was happening and where Carlos was taken.</p><p>At home, my mom greets me at the door. \u201cYour father said he\u2019ll be home soon with some news about Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you know what happened?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cAlex told your dad that Carlos keeps insisting the drugs aren\u2019t his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Alex believe him?\u201d</p><p>My mom sighs, and I know she wants to give me better news. \u201cHe\u2019s skeptical.\u201d</p><p>My dad comes home with hair that looks like he ran his hand through it too many times today. \u201cFamily-meeting time,\u201d he says.</p><p>When the entire family is in the living room, my dad clears his throat. \u201cHow would you all feel about having Carlos stay here for the rest of the school year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Carlos?\u201d Brandon asks, clueless.</p><p>\u201cThe brother of one of my former students. And one of Kiara\u2019s friends.\u201d My dad looks from me to my mom. \u201cTurns out the place where he\u2019s living is subsidized student apartments. Since Carlos isn\u2019t a student at the university, the judge said it\u2019s against policy for him to stay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get a brother? Cool!\u201d Brandon yells. \u201cCan he sleep in my room? You can buy us bunk beds and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get too excited, Bran. He\u2019ll stay in the yellow room,\u201d my dad tells my brother.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Carlos holding up?\u201d my mom asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think underneath it all he\u2019s a good kid who\u2019ll thrive in a positive and stable drug-free home environment. I\u2019d like to help out if we\u2019re all in agreement. It\u2019s either our house, or he goes back to Mexico. Alex said he\u2019d do just about anything to keep him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with him staying here,\u201d I say, realizing after I say it that I actually mean it. Everyone deserves a second chance.</p><p>My dad looks at my mom, who reaches out and brings his head closer to hers. \u201cMy husband is going to save the world one kid at a time, huh?\u201d</p><p>He smiles at her. \u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d</p><p>She kisses him. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure there are clean sheets on the bed in the guest room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI married the best woman,\u201d he tells her. \u201cI\u2019ll call Alex and tell him it\u2019s a go,\u201d he adds excitedly. \u201cMonday we\u2019ll meet with the judge again. We\u2019re going to lobby to get him into the REACH program at Flatiron instead of being expelled.\u201d</p><p>I watch as my dad leaves the living room and heads for his office.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on a mission,\u201d my mom says. \u201cHe\u2019s has that spark in his eye when he\u2019s got a challenge in front of him.\u201d</p><p>I just hope he keeps that spark alive, because I have a feeling my dad\u2019s patience\u2014 which is probably at the sainthood level\u2014is about to be tested big-time.</p><p>13</p><p>Carlos</p><p>\u201cJust send me back to Chicago and be done with me already,\u201d I tell Alex on Sunday morning after I hang up with mi'am\u00e1. Alex forced me to tell her what\u2019s going on.</p><p>When the police escorted me out in handcuffs, I was fine with it. Seeing my brother come to the station with frustration and disappointment etched on his face didn\u2019t faze me. But talking to my mom just now and hearing her cry and ask me what happened to her ni\u00f1ito was my undoing.</p><p>She also told me I shouldn\u2019t come back to Mexico. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe here for you,\u201d she told me. \u201cAus\u00e9ntese, Carlos, stay away.\u201d I wasn\u2019t surprised. My entire life has been full of people leavin\u2019 me or tellin\u2019 me to stay away from them\u2014mi pap\u00e1, Alex, Destiny, and now mi'am\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>Alex is lying in his bed, his forearm covering his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re not goin\u2019 back to Chicago, either. Professor Westford and his wife are lettin\u2019 you live at their house. It\u2019s a done deal.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Livin\u2019 with the Professor means I\u2019ll also be livin\u2019 in the same house as Kiara. That\u2019s a bad move on so many levels. \u201cDon\u2019t I have any say in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00a1Vete a la mierda!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you created the bullshit you\u2019re livin\u2019 in,\u201d my brother tells me.</p> <p>\u201cI told you those drugs weren\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>He sits up. \u201cCarlos, since you came here all you\u2019ve done is talk about drugs. They found chora in your locker, along with an insane amount of OC. Even if they weren\u2019t yours, you\u2019ve made yourself the scapegoat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is such bullshit.\u201d</p><p>A half hour later, after I get out of the shower, Brittany is back. She\u2019s sitting at the table, wearing a hot pink velour sweatsuit that hugs her curves. I swear that chica should just live here . . . she\u2019s around all the time.</p><p>I walk over to my bed, suddenly wishin\u2019 this wasn\u2019t a studio apartment. I\u2019m a pissed-off guy thirsty for revenge. I won\u2019t rest until I know who stuck those drugs in my locker. Whoever it was is gonna pay.</p> <p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t get expelled,\u201d Brittany says in a sad tone. \u201cBut I know Alex and Professor Westford will do all they can to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so depressed,\u201d I tell her. \u201cNow that I gotta move out, you can be here whenever the hell you want. Lucky you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos, retroceda,\u201d Alex says roughly.</p><p>Why should I back off ? It\u2019s the truth.</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, Carlos, I want you to be happy here.\u201d Brittany pushes a brand-new cell phone toward me. \u201cI got you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? So you and Alex can check up on me?\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cNo. I just thought you\u2019d want one so you can call us if you need us.\u201d</p><p>I pick up the phone. \u201cWho\u2019s payin\u2019 for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d she asks.</p><p>My family obviously can\u2019t afford it. I turn my back on Brittany and the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t need it,\u201d I tell her. \u201cSave your money.\u201d</p><p>The three of us pile into Brittany\u2019s Beemer a few hours later. I should have known Brittany would come on this little adventure to drop me off at the Professor\u2019s house, probably to make sure I\u2019m really out of her and my brother\u2019s hair.</p><p>Alex pulls onto one of the winding roads leading up into the mountains. When I look out at the big houses on either side of the road, it\u2019s obvious we\u2019ve entered the rich side of town. Poor people don\u2019t post signs like NO TRESPASSING, PRIVATE DRIVE, PRIVATE PROPERTY, MONITORED BY CAMERA SURVEILLANCE. I should know because I\u2019ve been poor my entire life, and the only person I know who ever posted a sign like these is my friend Pedro, and he actually stole the sign off a rich guy\u2019s yard.</p><p>We pull up a brick driveway leading to a two-story house built right into the mountain. I sit up and take in my surroundings. I\u2019ve never lived in a place where you couldn\u2019t easily throw a stone at your next-door neighbor\u2019s window.</p><p>You\u2019d think I\u2019d be thrilled at the chance to live in this fancy house, but it just reminds me I\u2019m an outsider. I\u2019m not an idiot; I know as soon as I leave here I\u2019ll be as poor as I always was\u2014or in jail. This place is just a tease, and I can\u2019t wait to get the hell out of here.</p> <p>As soon as we park, Westford comes out of the house. He\u2019s a tall guy with gray hair and a lot of wrinkles around his eyes as if he\u2019s smiled too much over the years and his skin is rebelling.</p><p>Before I even step out of the car, three more people pile out. It\u2019s like a fuckin\u2019 parade of white folks, one whiter than the next.</p><p>When Kiara walks out, her familiar face is as much a relief as it is an annoyance. In one morning I went from rigging her locker to being handcuffed and thrown in jail. My life went from amusement to completely fucked-up in a matter of hours.</p><p>Kiara has her light brown hair pulled back, and is wearing jean shorts and a baggy, puke green\u2013colored T-shirt. She definitely didn\u2019t dress up for my arrival, that\u2019s for sure. She\u2019s even got smudges of brown dirt or grease on her cheek and hands.</p><p>Next to Kiara is her brother. He must\u2019ve been a mistake or an afterthought, \u2019cause he looks like he could be in kindergarten. The little kid is a mess. He\u2019s got leftover chocolate smeared all over his chin.</p><p>\u201cThis is my wife, Colleen,\u201d he says, gesturing to the thin woman next to him. \u201cAnd my son, Brandon. Of course you already know my daughter, Kiara.\u201d</p><p>The Professor and his wife are wearing matching white golf shirts. I can totally see them playin\u2019 golf at a fancy country club on the weekends. Brandon could be in movies or commercials\u2014 he\u2019s so annoyingly energetic it almost makes you want to give him Z-Tabs to make him zone out.</p><p>While Brittany and Alex do the handshake thing with the Professor\u2019s wife and kids, Kiara steps closer to me.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asks so softly I can hardly hear her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I mumble. I don\u2019t want to talk about bein\u2019 arrested and taken away in the back of the squad car to juvie.</p><p>Damn, this is awkward. The little kid, Brandon, pulls at my pant leg. His fingers have melted chocolate all over them. \u201cDo you play soccer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I look over at Alex, who doesn\u2019t seem to notice or doesn\u2019t care the runt is messin\u2019 up my jeans.</p><p>Mrs. Westford smiles as she guides Brandon away from me. \u201cCarlos, why don\u2019t you take a few minutes to get settled, then come to the backyard for some lunch. Dick, take Carlos upstairs and show him around.\u201d</p><p>Dick? I shake my head. The Professor doesn\u2019t have a problem being called Dick? If my name was Richard, I\u2019d go by Richard or Rich . . . not Dick. Hell, I\u2019d even settle for being called Chard.</p><p>I grab my duffel.</p><p>\u201cCarlos, follow me,\u201d Westford says, \u201cI\u2019ll show you around. Kiara, why don\u2019t you show Alex and Brittany your car.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the crew follows Kiara while I follow Professor Dick.</p><p>\u201cThis is our home,\u201d Westford says. Just as I suspected, the inside is as massive as the outside. It\u2019s not as big as Madison\u2019s place, but it\u2019s still bigger than any place I\u2019ve ever lived. Big paintings line the hallway. They\u2019ve got a nice flat-screen TV hanging on the wall over the fireplace. \u201cJust make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, right. This is as much my home as the White House.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the kitchen,\u201d he says, leading me into a huge room with an oversized stainless-steel fridge and appliances to match. Their counters are black with little pieces of what looks like diamonds in them. \u201cIf you want something from the fridge or pantry, feel free. Don\u2019t feel like you have to ask.\u201d</p><p>Next, I follow him up a flight of carpeted stairs. \u201cAny questions so far?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cGot a map of this place?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to the layout in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Wanna bet?</p><p>I feel a big, pounding headache coming on and I long to be somewhere where I don\u2019t have to pretend to be a reformed kid living in a minimansion with a girl who put cookie magnets in my locker and a little runt who thinks all Mexicans play soccer.</p><p>Upstairs, at the end of long hallway, is the parents\u2019 bedroom. We turn the corner and Westford points to one of the rooms. \u201cThat\u2019s Kiara\u2019s room. The door across the hall, next to Brandon\u2019s room, is the bathroom you\u2019ll share with the kids.\u201d I peek inside the bathroom, which has two side-by-side sinks.</p><p>He opens the door next to Kiara\u2019s room and gestures me inside. \u201cThis is your room.\u201d</p><p>I scan what will be my bedroom. The walls are painted yellow, with polka-dotted drapes hanging from the windows. It looks like a damn girl\u2019s room. I wonder if I stay here long enough I\u2019ll be forced to hand in my Man Card. There\u2019s a desk on one side with a closet next to it, a dresser on the other side of the room, and a bed with a yellow blanket next to the window.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not the most masculine room. My wife decorated it a while back,\u201d Westford says, looking apologetic. \u201cIt was supposed to be her porcelain-doll room.\u201d</p><p>Is he kiddin\u2019 me? Porcelain-doll room? What the hell are porcelain dolls, and why would an adult want a room full of \u2019em? Maybe it\u2019s a rich-white-people thing, \u2019cause I don\u2019t know any Mexican families who have a bedroom just for their damn dolls.</p><p>\u201cI figure we can get some paint and make this room a little more guy friendly,\u201d he says.</p><p>My eyes focus on the polka-dotted curtains. \u201cIt\u2019ll take a lot more than paint,\u201d I mumble. \u201cBut it don\u2019t matter, \u2019cause I\u2019m not plannin\u2019 on hangin\u2019 around here much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess now is a good time to go over house rules.\u201d My temporary guardian settles into the chair by the desk.</p><p>\u201cRules?\u201d A feeling of dread washes over me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I only have a few. But I do expect them to be followed. First off, no drugs or alcohol. As you already know, marijuana isn\u2019t hard to find in this city, but you have to stay clean per court order. Second, no profanity. I have a six-year-old who is very impressionable, and I don\u2019t need him hearing cuss words. Third, curfew on weekdays is midnight, on weekends it\u2019s two. Fourth, you\u2019re expected to clean up after yourself and help around the house when asked, just like our own children. Fifth, there\u2019s no TV unless you\u2019re done with homework. Sixth, if you bring a girl up to your room you must keep the door open . . . for obvious reasons.\u201d He rubs his chin, seemingly searching for more rules to spout. \u201cI think that\u2019s it. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, one.\u201d I shove my hands in my pockets, wondering how long it\u2019ll take for Professor Dick to realize I\u2019m antirules. Of any kind. \u201cWhat happens when I break one of your fuckin\u2019 rules?\u201d</p><p>14</p><p>Kiara</p><p>I don\u2019t know if anyone else in my family noticed, but Carlos looked at us like we were a bunch of aliens sent down to earth to destroy him. He definitely isn\u2019t happy about having to live with us.</p><p>I wonder what he\u2019s going to say when they tell him he\u2019ll either be expelled or have to go to the REACH program after school. REACH is for at-risk teens who get in trouble. They can attend school on a probationary basis. My dad told me Carlos doesn\u2019t know that REACH is his only choice. I do not want to be in the house when Alex and my dad give him the news.</p><p>Alex is checking out the new rearview mirror I just installed. Not being able to resist, Alex lifts up the hood and inspects the engine.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a standard V8,\u201d I tell Brittany, who\u2019s standing beside him.</p><p>Alex laughs. \u201cThat won\u2019t mean anythin\u2019 to my girlfriend. Brittany doesn\u2019t even like to pump gas.\u201d</p><p>Brittany punches him lightly on the arm. \u201cAre you kidding me? Every time I even try to fix something with my car, Alex totally takes over. Admit it, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMamacita, no offense, but you wouldn\u2019t know a gasket from an alternator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t know acrylic from gel,\u201d Brittany says smugly, her hands on her hips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre we still talkin\u2019 cars?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Brittany shakes her head. \u201cI was talking fingernails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so. You stick to nails, I\u2019ll stick to cars.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Alex\u2019s mouth quirks up as he pulls his girlfriend close.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re ready for lunch,\u201d my dad yells from the front door.</p><p>My mom waves to my brother. \u201cBrandon, sweetie, show Brittany and Alex where the patio is.\u201d</p><p>While Brandon races to the backyard, I help my mom in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got grease on your chin,\u201d my mom tells me. I rub my chin, then realize it\u2019s not grease. It\u2019s black epoxy.</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re smearing it. Here\u2014\u201d She tosses me a kitchen towel.</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d After I wipe my chin clean, I wash my hands and then toss my special walnut salad.</p><p>On the patio, my mom has set up pink flowery place mats and her favorite ceramic dishes painted with images of colorful butterflies that match the teacups. She opened up an organic tea store called Hospitali-Tea a few years ago. If you live in Boulder, bets are you like the outdoors and live an active lifestyle. And bets are you drink tea instead of coffee.</p><p>Mom\u2019s store is very popular with the locals. I work there on weekends bagging loose teas, logging in new teas, and pricing ceramic teapots. I even help with her accounting, especially when her calculations are off and she needs someone to find where she made a mistake. I\u2019m the mistake-finder in the family, at least when it comes to doing the books.</p><p>I help bring out the salad. I actually made up the recipe and have kept the dressing a secret so even my parents don\u2019t know how to replicate it. It\u2019s made with spinach leaves, walnuts, blue cheese, and dried cranberries . . . and \u201cKiara\u2019s special, secret sauce,\u201d as my mom likes to call it. When I get outside, I hold out the bowl to Carlos.</p><p>He peers inside the bowl. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalad.\u201d</p> <p>He peers inside again. \u201cThat\u2019s not lettuce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s s-spinach.\u201d I stop talking as I feel my tongue getting thicker.</p><p>\u201cJust try it,\u201d Alex tells him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be told what to do,\u201d Carlos fires back.</p><p>\u201cCarlos, I have some lettuce in the fridge,\u201d my mom chimes in. \u201cI can throw a lettuce salad together quickly if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Carlos mutters.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like some salad,\u201d Brittany says, motioning for me to hand her the bowl. I don\u2019t know if she really wants the spinach salad or not, but she\u2019s trying hard to divert attention away from Alex and Carlos.</p><p>I look over at my dad. He\u2019s got his eyes on Carlos. He\u2019s probably wondering how long it\u2019ll take before he can get Carlos to loosen up and trust us. Problem is, I don\u2019t know if Carlos will ever let his guard down now that he got arrested.</p> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re here due to extenuating circumstances,\u201d my mom says to Carlos as she passes around the plate of salmon burgers. \u201cBut we\u2019re happy to offer our home and friendship.\u201d</p><p>My dad stabs a burger with his fork. \u201cKiara can show you around Boulder this weekend. And introduce you to her friends. Right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say, although \u201cmy friends\u201d consist of Tuck. I\u2019m not one to hang out with a crowd. Tuck is a guy, but he\u2019s my best friend and has been since freshman year when Heather Harte and Madison Stone laughed at me during English class when I was called on to read A Tale of Two Cities in front of the entire class. Not only did I embarrass myself with my stuttering, I think Dickens must have rolled over in his grave when I horrifically butchered his words. I stopped immediately after hearing them laugh, ran home, and didn\u2019t come out of my room until Tuck came over and convinced me to face the world. Friday in Mr. Furie\u2019s class brought me back to that day.</p><p>\u201cI think I got an undercooked burger. It\u2019s really pink,\u201d Carlos says as he stares at the inside of one of my mother\u2019s salmon patties.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fish,\u201d I tell him. \u201cSalmon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere bones in it?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>He picks out a bun from the breadbasket, examines it, then shrugs. I guess he\u2019s not used to whole grains sticking out of his burger buns.</p><p>\u201cI have to go to work, but Kiara can take you grocery shopping tomorrow if you want,\u201d my mom volunteers. \u201cThat way you can pick whatever you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like sports, Carlos?\u201d Brandon asks him.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s playin\u2019. I don\u2019t watch tennis or golf, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about watching sports, silly,\u201d Brandon says, laughing at him. \u201cI\u2019m talking about playing them. My best friend, Max, plays tackle football, and he\u2019s my age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for him,\u201d Carlos says as he takes a bite of the salmon burger.</p><p>\u201cDo you play football?\u201d Brandon asks.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaseball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Brandon is on a roll and won\u2019t stop until he\u2019s found the answer he\u2019s looking for. \u201cTennis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be a nada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what sport do you play?\u201d</p><p>Carlos puts down his food. Oh, no. He\u2019s got a rebellious gleam in his eye as he says, \u201cThe horizontal tango.\u201d</p><p>My mom and Brittany start choking on their food. My dad says, \u201cCarlos . . .\u201d in a warning tone he reserves for extreme instances.</p><p>\u201cDancing really isn\u2019t a sport,\u201d Brandon tells Carlos, oblivious to the shock at the rest of the table.</p><p>\u201cIt is when I do it,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>Alex stands and says through clenched teeth, \u201cCarlos, let\u2019s talk. In private. Ahora.\u201d</p><p>Alex walks into the house. I\u2019m not sure Carlos is going to follow. He hesitates, then his chair scrapes the patio tiles and he heads inside. Oh, this is definitely not going to be pretty.</p><p>Brittany puts her head in her hands. \u201cPlease tell me when they stop arguing.\u201d</p><p>Brandon turns to my dad with big, innocent eyes. \u201cDaddy, do you know how to do the horizontal tango?\u201d</p><p>15</p><p>Carlos</p><p>\u201cDo you get off on being a pendejo?\u201d my brother asks me when we\u2019re in the kitchen, out of hearing range of the gringos.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . yeah. I had the best teacher. Right, Alex?\u201d</p><p>Since our father was murdered when I was four, Alex was the oldest male in our house from the time he was six. He might be older than me, but there was nobody else to look up to but him.</p><p>My brother leans against the kitchen counter and crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal: you got busted with drugs. I don\u2019t give a shit if they were yours or not, you\u2019re the one who got busted. So suck it up and live here without causin\u2019 problems, or you get shipped to a youth home for delinquents with guards watchin\u2019 your every move. Which is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I go back to Chicago? We\u2019ve got family there. My old friends are there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot an option.\u201d Before I can respond, Alex says, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to get messed up with the Latino Blood. Besides, Destiny isn\u2019t waiting for you, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Destiny and I broke up the day my family packed and moved to Mexico. She said it was no use havin\u2019 a long-distance relationship when we might never see each other again. Truth is, if it wasn\u2019t for Alex we\u2019d never have left Chicago. And if we never left Chicago, Destiny and I would have stayed together and I wouldn\u2019t be stuck livin\u2019 in a room with damn yellow polka-dotted curtains.</p><p>I expect everyone in my life to leave me at some point. Since Destiny, I haven\u2019t allowed myself to get emotionally involved with anyone. If I let myself care about someone, they\u2019ll leave me, push me away, or die. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s been, and will always be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here for now, but one day soon I\u2019m gonna get back to Chicago, with or without your help. Just go back to your apartment and stay out of my life.\u201d I push past my brother and storm up to my room, slamming the door behind me. But the yellow comforter is a reminder this is not my room. \u00a1Mierda!</p><p>I\u2019m glad Alex didn\u2019t follow me. I need to be alone and sort out what happened on Friday. Who put the drugs in my locker? Was it Nick? Madison, who came to bio late? Or was it a sign from the Guerreros that no matter where I go they\u2019re never far behind?</p><p>Eyeing my duffel on the ground, I open it and put my clothes away. Actually I toss them in the drawers, not bothering to hang \u2019em up. I don\u2019t wear clothes that have to be hung up, anyway. I take out my toothbrush and shaver and head to the bathroom across the hall. Assuming the sink with the step stool is Brandon\u2019s, I decide to share with him. The last thing I need is to be opening a drawer only to find tampons, makeup, or other female crap.</p><p>I stick my shaver and toothbrush in an empty drawer, the one without the cartoon-character bubble bath in it. In between the sinks, taped to the big mirror in front of them, is a small piece of paper.</p><p>WEEKDAY MORNING SHOWER TIMES</p><p>Monday, Wednesday, Friday: Kiara 6:25\u20136:35</p><p>Monday, Wednesday, Friday: Carlos 6:40\u20136:50</p><p>Tuesday, Thursday: Kiara 6:40\u20136:50</p><p>Tuesday, Thursday: Carlos 6:25\u20136:35</p><p>When should I break the news to Kiara that nobody is going to tell me how long my showers are? I\u2019ve been known to take hour-long showers when I\u2019m hot, sweaty, and pissed off. Like right about now.</p><p>As if it wasn\u2019t bad enough I got busted for somethin\u2019 I didn\u2019t do, now I have to share a house with a bunch of strangers who make salad out of spinach.</p><p>I head back to my room, but when I see Kiara\u2019s door cracked open I get curious. Knowing she\u2019s still eating lunch, I wander inside. Her desk is piled with books and loose papers. There\u2019s a corkboard above her desk with different sayings that belong in a self-help manual:</p><p>Don\u2019t be afraid to be unique Love yourself before you love another Give me a fucking break. Does she read that crap before she gets off?</p><p>A few pictures of Kiara and that guy she sits with in the lunchroom every day are pinned to the board. One shows the two of them hiking or something on a mountain, and the other is of the two of them on snowboards. In the pictures, Kiara is laughing.</p><p>I pick up one of the notebooks on her desk and flip through the pages. I stop when I see RULES OF ATTRACTION written on top of one of the pages. My eyes immediately focus on the words \u201cperky privates\u201d listed under Kiara\u2019s traits. I laugh, then scan the next column . . . she\u2019s lookin\u2019 for a dude who is confident, nice, can fix cars, and likes sports. Who the hell actually writes this stuff down? I\u2019m surprised she didn\u2019t write I\u2019m looking for a guy to rub my feet and kiss my ass. On the next pages are pencil drawings of her car. I hear the bedroom door squeak. Oh, crap. I\u2019m not alone.</p><p>Kiara is standing in the doorway in shock. Behind her is the guy from the pictures. Kiara looks stunned to find me in her room, my paws on her notebook.</p><p>\u201cI needed paper,\u201d I say, keeping a casual tone as I drop the notebook on her desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The guy steps forward. \u201cYo, yo, wassup homie!\u201d he says.</p><p>I wonder what Professor Dick would say if I kicked Kiara\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s ass on my first day here. He never said one of the rules was not getting into fights.</p><p>I narrow my eyes at the guy and step forward.</p><p>Kiara quickly rummages through her desk and pulls out another notebook. She pushes it into my hand. \u201cHere,\u201d she says, alarm laced in her voice.</p> <p>I look down at the notebook I didn\u2019t need, annoyed that I\u2019m feeling like a jalape\u00f1o stuck in a bowl of mixed nuts . . . somewhere I don\u2019t belong and definitely not a good mix.</p><p>I murmur a \u201cCatch you later . . . homie,\u201d and head back to the canary yellow room I am officially dubbing infierno, hell.</p><p>Looking out the window, I gauge how far it is to the ground so I can escape every once in a while and get a small taste of freedom. One day I might just escape and never look back.</p><p>\u201cCarlos, can I come in?\u201d I hear Brittany\u2019s voice say through the bedroom door.</p><p>When I open the door, I find my brother\u2019s girlfriend alone. \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna lecture me, save your breath,\u201d I tell her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to lecture you,\u201d she says, her bright blue eyes shining with compassion. She weasels her way past me and enters the room. \u201cAnd although I\u2019m sure your friends back home might appreciate details of your sexual prowess, bragging about it in front of a six-year-old and his parents probably isn\u2019t the best idea.\u201d</p><p>I hold my hand up, stopping her from continuing. \u201cBefore you go on, I gotta be honest and say that sounds suspiciously like a lecture to me.\u201d</p><p>She laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Sorry about that. Truth is, I came up here to give you the cell phone. I know you and Alex are like oil and water sometimes, so I\u2019m here if you want to talk to someone a little less hardheaded. I programmed both our numbers into the contacts list.\u201d She places the phone on the desk.</p><p>Oh, no. I feel her trying to get close to me like the sister I never had, but it ain\u2019t happenin\u2019. I don\u2019t get close, so I decide to go for the asshole route. It actually comes naturally to me; it\u2019s not even an act anymore. \u201cYou flirtin\u2019 with me? I thought you were datin\u2019 my brother. Honestly, Brittany, I don\u2019t date white chicas. Especially ones with blond hair and skin the color of Elmer\u2019s Glue. Did\u2019ja ever hear of a tannin\u2019 salon?\u201d</p><p>Okay, the Elmer\u2019s Glue comment was a little over-the-top. Brittany has a golden glow to her skin, but insulting her will push her away. I\u2019ve done it with mi'am\u00e1. And Luis. And Alex. It never fails.</p><p>I make a big show of opening the desk drawer and dumping the phone inside.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want that one day,\u201d she says. \u201cI have no doubt you\u2019ll call me.\u201d</p><p>I give a short laugh. \u201cYou have no clue who I am or what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>I step forward, invading her personal space so she\u2019ll back up and know I mean business. \u201cDon\u2019t piss me off, bitch. In Mexico I was hangin\u2019 with gangbangers.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t back down. Instead, she says, \u201cMy boyfriend was in a gang, Carlos. And neither of you scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anyone tell you you\u2019d be a perfect mamacita to prove the dumb-blond theory?\u201d</p><p>Instead of cowering in fear or getting furious, she steps forward and kisses my cheek. \u201cI forgive you,\u201d she says, then backs out of the room and leaves me alone.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for your forgiveness. Or want it,\u201d I say back, but she\u2019s already gone.</p> <p>16</p><p>Kiara</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he wanted paper,\u201d Tuck says as he straddles my desk chair. \u201cHe was snooping. Believe me, I know snooping when I see it.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and sit on my bed. \u201cDid you have to bait Carlos with all that \u2018yo, yo, homie\u2019 talk?\u201d Sometimes Tuck just talks to amuse himself. I don\u2019t think Carlos appreciated Tuck\u2019s humor.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t help it. He thinks he\u2019s so tough I wanted to bring him down a peg.\u201d Tuck\u2019s face perks up. \u201cI\u2019ve got a great idea. Let\u2019s snoop back.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo way. Besides, he\u2019s probably in his room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s back downstairs with the rest of your family. We won\u2019t know unless we check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d he moans like my brother does when he doesn\u2019t get his way. \u201cLet\u2019s have some fun. I\u2019m bored and I have to leave soon.\u201d</p><p>Before I have time to digest what Tuck is about to do, he disappears into the hall. I hear his footsteps creak as he steps toward Carlos\u2019s room. Oh, no. This is definitely not good. Not good at all. I grab Tuck\u2019s arm and try to pull him back, but he doesn\u2019t budge. I should know better. When Tuck is on a mission, nothing can stop him. He\u2019s kind of like my dad that way.</p><p>Carlos\u2019s door is open a crack. Tuck peers inside. \u201cI don\u2019t see him,\u201d Tuck says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause I was takin\u2019 a piss,\u201d Carlos says from behind me.</p><p>Oh. No. We\u2019re. Busted.</p><p>I suck in a breath at being caught, and pinch Tuck. This stunt really wasn\u2019t one of his brightest ideas. I wonder if Carlos will retaliate with a cookie stunt of his own.</p><p>\u201cWe were just, uh, wondering how Kiara\u2019s notebook was working out for you,\u201d Tuck says, not the least bit embarrassed at getting caught and just making up stuff off the top of his head. \u201cOr do you need loose-leaf? \u2019Cause we could scrounge up some of that if you need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>Tuck holds out his hand. \u201cBy the way, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been formally introduced. I\u2019m Tuck. You know, rhymes with luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fuck,\u201d Carlos adds.</p><p>\u201cYep, that, too,\u201d Tuck says, unfazed. He points to Carlos with a big, cocky smile. \u201cYou are quick with the comebacks, amigo.\u201d</p><p>Carlos flicks Tuck\u2019s finger away. \u201cI\u2019m not your amigo, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Tuck\u2019s cell phone rings. He slides it out of his pants and says, \u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d then shrugs and says to me, \u201cWell, I\u2019m outta here. My stepdad, Rick, is making me and Mom go to some stupid rope-knotting class. Kiara, I\u2019ll see you in school tomorrow.\u201d He turns to Carlos. \u201cSee you \u2019round, amigo.\u201d</p><p>Tuck is out of sight in an instant, leaving me standing with Carlos in the hallway. He steps in front of me. When Carlos has his attention fixed on me, it\u2019s very intimidating, whether he intends it or not. He\u2019s like a panther ready to pounce, or a vampire ready to suck the blood out of anyone who stands in his way.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, I didn\u2019t need paper. Your boy Tuck was right on. I was snoopin\u2019.\u201d He walks back to his room, but turns to me before he closes the door. \u201cThese walls are paper thin. You might want to remember that the next time you and your boyfriend talk about me,\u201d he says, then slams his door shut.</p><p>17</p><p>Carlos</p><p>In the evening, I\u2019m summoned to the Professor\u2019s home office. I expect his wrath. Honestly, I want his wrath. If he or that judge at the juvie courthouse thought bringin\u2019 me here would reform me or change me, guess again. It\u2019s pure instinct that makes me rebel every time someone tries to control my life and hand out more rules.</p><p>Professor Westford tents his fingers and leans forward in his chair, which is facing the small couch I\u2019m sitting on. \u201cWhat do you want, Carlos?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Huh? I\u2019m caught off guard here. I didn\u2019t expect him to say that. I want to go back to Mexico and continue living my life on my terms. Or go back to Chicago, where my friends and cousins I grew up with are . . . I sure as hell can\u2019t tell him I\u2019d like to bring mi pap\u00e1 back from the dead.</p><p>Westford sighs when I don\u2019t answer. \u201cI know you\u2019re a tough kid,\u201d he says. \u201cAlex told me you got into some heavy stuff in Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I just want you to know that you can create a new life here, Carlos. You started off on the wrong foot, but you can wipe the slate clean and start new. Alex and your mother want the best for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Dick. Alex doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother knows you better than you think he does. And you\u2019re more alike than you want to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just met me. You don\u2019t know me, either. And to be honest, I don\u2019t have much respect for you. You opened your home to a guy who got arrested for drugs. How come you\u2019re not afraid of havin\u2019 me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the first kid I\u2019ve helped, and you won\u2019t be the last,\u201d he assures me. \u201cAnd I should probably let you know that before I got my doctorate in psychology I was in the military. I saw more death and guns and bad guys than you\u2019ll ever see in your life. I might have gray hair on my head, but I\u2019m just as tough as you are when I have to be. I think we can work together. Now, let\u2019s get back to why I called you down here. What is it that you want?\u201d</p><p>I better say somethin\u2019 to get him off my back. \u201cTo go back to Chicago.\u201d</p><p>Westford leans back. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019dya mean \u2018okay\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He puts his hands up. \u201cI mean \u2018okay.\u2019 You follow my house rules until winter break, and I\u2019ll get you to Chicago for a visit. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. And I don\u2019t break them. Ever. Now, enough serious talk for tonight. Relax and make yourself at home. Watch some TV if you want.\u201d</p><p>Instead, I head straight for polka-dot hell. When I pass Brandon\u2019s room the kid is sitting on the floor, wearing pajamas with little baseballs, mitts, and bats splattered all over them. The little kid is playing with plastic soldiers. He looks all innocent and happy. It\u2019s easy for him\u2014he hasn\u2019t been exposed to the real world.</p><p>The real world sucks.</p><p>As soon as he sees me, he smiles wide. \u201cHey, Carlos, wanna play soldiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night?\u201d he asks, hope filling his voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means ask me tomorrow and I might have a different answer.\u201d On second thought, \u201cGet your sister to play with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just did. Now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d</p><p>My turn? This kid has serious delusions if he thinks that I actually want a turn. \u201cTell you what. After school tomorrow I\u2019ll play soccer with you. If you can get one goal off me, I\u2019ll play soldiers with you.\u201d</p><p>The kid looks confused. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t play soccer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not s\u2019posed to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, when you\u2019re a teenager you\u2019ll be doin\u2019 it all the time.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>I chuckle. \u201cCall me when you\u2019re sixteen. I guarantee you\u2019ll have a different opinion,\u201d I say, then head for my room. Kiara is in the hallway. Her ponytail is loose, and most of her hair has managed to escape. I\u2019ve never met any girl who cares less about her appearance. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere you goin\u2019 all dressed up?\u201d I joke.</p><p>She clears her throat, like she\u2019s stalling. \u201cJogging,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExercise. You . . . can come.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNah.\u201d I\u2019ve always had the theory that people who exercise are white-collar stiffs, \u2019cause most of their day is spent sitting on their asses. She starts to walk away, but I call her back. \u201cKiara, wait.\u201d She turns around. \u201cTell Tuck to stay out of my way. And about your shower-time schedule . . .\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m gonna let her know how it is, let her know who\u2019s boss here. Her father might try and dictate rules I have no intention of keepin\u2019, but nobody, especially not a gringa, dictates when I can take a shower. I cross my arms over my chest and tell her straight up, \u201cI don\u2019t do schedules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I d-do, so get used t-to it,\u201d she says, then turns away from me and heads straight for the stairs.</p><p>I stay in my room until morning, when the Professor\u2019s voice bellows through the door. \u201cCarlos, if you\u2019re not up, you\u2019d better get a move on. We\u2019re leaving in a half hour.\u201d</p><p>When I hear his footsteps retreat, I crawl out of bed and head to the bathroom. I open the door and find Brandon brushing his teeth. He\u2019s getting toothpaste all over our sink and his mouth, and he looks like he\u2019s got rabies.</p> <p>\u201cHurry up, cachorro. I gotta take a leak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what cha-cha-cho-ro-ro means.\u201d</p><p>The kid isn\u2019t fluent in Spanish, that\u2019s for sure. \u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to.\u201d</p><p>Brandon finishes up while I lean against the doorway. I hear Kiara\u2019s door open. She walks out of her room, all dressed. Well, you can\u2019t exactly call it dressed. She\u2019s got her hair up in her signature ponytail, a yellow T-shirt with the word ADVENTURELAND on it, baggy brown shorts, and hiking boots.</p><p>One look at me and her eyes go all wide and her face gets all red. She looks away.</p><p>\u201cHa, ha, ha!\u201d Brandon laughs, pointing to my boxer briefs. I look down to make sure I don\u2019t have my own perky private showing. \u201cKiara saw your underpants! Kiara saw your underpants!\u201d he sings.</p> <p>She walks downstairs and is out of sight within seconds.</p><p>I narrow my eyes at Brandon. \u201cDid anyone ever tell you that you\u2019re an annoyin\u2019 little shit sometimes?\u201d</p><p>Brandon\u2019s hand flies to his mouth and he sucks in a breath. \u201cYou said a bad word.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m internally rolling my eyes. I\u2019m definitely gonna have to start speakin\u2019 Spanish around this kid so he has no clue what I\u2019m saying. Or beat this kid at his own game. \u201cI did not. I said you were an annoyin\u2019 little spit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You said shit.\u201d</p><p>My hand flies to my mouth and I gasp. I point at him and wiggle my finger just like a two-year-old and say, \u201cYou just said a bad word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it first, Carlos,\u201d he argues. \u201cI was just saying what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said spit. You said somethin\u2019 that rhymed with it. I\u2019m tellin\u2019.\u201d I open my mouth to tattle. I\u2019m not really gonna do it, but the little diablo doesn\u2019t know that.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll give you a free pass. This time. See, now we\u2019re partners in crime.\u201d</p><p>He furrows his little eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means we don\u2019t tattle on each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you do something bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you keep your mouth shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I do something bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>He seems to consider this for a minute. \u201cSo if you see me eat all of the cookies in the pantry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t feel like brushing my teeth?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou can go to school with rotten breath and cavities for all I care.\u201d</p><p>Brandon smiles wide and holds out his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal, my man.\u201d</p><p>My man? As I watch Brandon trot back to his room, I wonder if I just outwitted the kid or if he just outwitted me.</p><p>18</p><p>Kiara</p><p>So it\u2019s no secret what Carlos wears to bed. His boxers. That\u2019s it. I had to look away when I was upstairs in the hallway, because I was staring. He\u2019s got more tattoos than the ones on his bicep and forearm. He\u2019s got a small one on his chest in the shape of a snake, and when my gaze dropped I caught a glimpse of letters in red and black peeking out of his briefs. While I\u2019m fascinated to know what they all mean and why he got them, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to ask.</p><p>My mom left over an hour ago to open her store. It\u2019s my turn to make breakfast for everyone. My dad is wolfing down the eggs and toast I just set on his plate. I know he\u2019s expecting Alex in a few minutes and is probably going through the speech he and Alex are going to give Carlos this morning.</p><p>I definitely don\u2019t want to be here for that talk, and am kind of feeling guilty for challenging Carlos last night. The last thing he needs right now is another person he thinks is against him.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d I say as I sit down next to him at the breakfast counter. \u201cWhat are you going to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth. That after the judge confirms temporary custody, I hope they\u2019ll let him register for the REACH program instead of serving time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d My dad pats me on the hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll all work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBecause deep down I suspect he wants to clean up his life, and the judge wants to keep kids in school. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure Carlos even knows how much he wants to succeed yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of a jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a cover-up for something deeper. I know he\u2019s definitely going to be a challenge.\u201d He cocks his head to the side and gives me a thoughtful look. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay with him staying here?\u201d</p><p>I think of myself in his situation and wonder if anyone would try to help me. Isn\u2019t that why we\u2019re put on this earth to begin with, to make it a better place? It\u2019s not a religious quest; it\u2019s a humanitarian one.</p><p>If Carlos can\u2019t stay here, who knows where he\u2019ll end up. \u201cI\u2019m totally fine with him here,\u201d I say. \u201cReally.\u201d My dad, with his psychology background and infinite patience, will be able to help Carlos. And my mom . . . well, if you can see past her quirks, she\u2019s great.</p><p>\u201cBrandon, where\u2019s Carlos?\u201d my dad asks when my brother comes bouncing down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think he was in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Well, get some breakfast in you. Your bus\u2019ll be here in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>When we hear the upstairs water turn off, indicating Carlos is out of the shower, it\u2019s my dad\u2019s cue. \u201cBran, get your backpack. The bus will be here any second.\u201d</p><p>As my dad urges Brandon out of the house to catch the bus, I scramble a couple of eggs for Carlos.</p><p>I hear him coming down the stairs before I see him. He\u2019s wearing dark blue jeans ripped in the knees, and a black T-shirt that looks overworn and overwashed . . . but I can just imagine is totally soft and comfortable.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I mumble, placing the eggs and toast neatly on the table with a glass of fresh-squeezed juice.</p><p>\u201cGracias.\u201d He sits down slowly, obviously surprised I made him breakfast.</p><p>As he eats, I load the dishwasher and busy myself with taking out the lunches my mom packed for us. When my dad comes back a few minutes later, he\u2019s accompanied by Alex.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, brother,\u201d Alex says as he sits beside Carlos. \u201cReady for court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I grab my car keys and backpack, so they can be alone. As I drive to school, I wonder if maybe I should have stayed as a buffer. Because three guys together, especially if two are very strong-willed Fuentes brothers, might be a dangerous mix. Especially when one of them is about to be forced to enroll in an after-school program for delinquents. I guarantee when they tell him, Carlos will go ballistic.</p><p>My poor father doesn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>19</p><p>Carlos</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019re you doin\u2019 here?\u201d I ask my brother again.</p><p>I look at Westford, a cup of coffee in his hand. Something is definitely up.</p><p>\u201cAlex wanted to be here when we discuss what will happen today. We\u2019re going to ask the judge to release you into my custody in exchange for your cooperation and participation in a special after-school program.\u201d</p><p>I look at my food, half uneaten, and toss my fork down. \u201cI thought we were just goin\u2019 to court and I was goin\u2019 to be released into your custody. Now I feel like I\u2019m at a firin\u2019 range about to be blindfolded and given my last cigarette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really a big deal,\u201d Alex says. \u201cIt\u2019s called REACH.\u201d</p><p>Westford sits across from me. \u201cIt\u2019s a special program for at-risk teens.\u201d</p><p>I look to Alex to give it to me in plain English.</p><p>Alex clears his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s for kids who\u2019ve been in trouble with the law, Carlos. You\u2019ll go there right after school. Every day,\u201d he adds.</p><p>Are they kiddin\u2019 me? \u201cI told you the drugs weren\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>Westford puts his mug down on the table. \u201cThen tell me who the drugs belong to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough,\u201d Westford says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a code of silence,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>Westford doesn\u2019t understand. \u201cA code of silence?\u201d</p><p>Alex looks up. \u201cI know a member of the Guerreros del barrio,\u201d he says. \u201cA code of silence protects all members. He won\u2019t talk, even if he knows who was responsible.\u201d</p><p>Westford sighs. \u201cA code of silence doesn\u2019t help your brother any, but I get it. I don\u2019t want to get it, but I do. And that leaves us no choice but to ask the judge to let Carlos enter the REACH program. It\u2019s a good program, Carlos, and it beats getting kicked out of school or stuck in juvenile detention. You\u2019ll get your high school diploma and be able to apply to colleges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not goin\u2019 to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what are you going to do after high school?\u201d Westford asks. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell me deal drugs, \u2019cause that\u2019s a cop out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know, Dick? It\u2019s easy for you to sit here in your bigass house and eat your organic shitty food. When you\u2019ve walked a day in my shoes, you can lecture me. Until then, I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMi'am\u00e1 wants us to have a better life than she did,\u201d Alex says. \u201cDo it for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cwhatever,\u201d I say as I put my dishes in the sink. I\u2019ve definitely lost my appetite. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s get this shit over with.\u201d</p><p>Westford picks up his briefcase and breathes a sigh of relief. \u201cYou ready, boys?\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes and rub my palms over them. I guess it\u2019s wishful thinking that I\u2019d open them and magically be in Chicago. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want me to answer that, do you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A half smile crosses his face. \u201cNot really.

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Westford had said it was one of those toy cars that kids drive around.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fuel-efficient. My wife drives the SUV, and since I\u2019m just driving to work and back, this was a perfect choice. If you want to drive it, you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could come in my car,\u201d Alex says.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I say as I open the door to the Smart Car and climb into the little passenger seat. It doesn\u2019t seem as tiny on the inside, but I still feel like I\u2019m in a miniature spaceship.</p> <p>It takes less than an hour for the judge to grant the Professor temporary guardianship and approve my participation in REACH instead of my being sentenced to either juvie or community service. Alex leaves because he\u2019s got a test, so it\u2019s up to my new guardian to register me at REACH and then drive me to school.</p><p>REACH is held in a brown brick building a few blocks from the high school. After waiting in the lobby, we\u2019re brought into the director\u2019s office.</p><p>A big, tall white guy who probably weighs close to three hundred pounds greets us. \u201cI\u2019m Ted Morrisey, the director here at REACH. And you must be Carlos.\u201d He flips through a file and says, \u201cTell me why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudge\u2019s orders,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cIt says here in my file you got arrested last Friday for school drug possession.\u201d He looks up. \u201cThat\u2019s a serious offense.\u201d</p><p>Only \u2019cause I got caught. The problem is, I\u2019m Mexican with gang affiliations. There\u2019s no way this guy is gonna believe I was framed. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s heard \u201cI didn\u2019t do it\u201d from most of the kids here. I\u2019ll find out who framed me . . . and in the end I\u2019ll get revenge.</p> <p>For the next half hour, Morrisey recites The Lecture. To sum it up, it\u2019s about me having control of my destiny and future. This is my last chance. If I want to succeed, the REACH program will help give me the tools to \u201cREACH my potential,\u201d yadda yadda. When I graduate the program, the career counselors are dedicated to helping every REACH graduate secure either a job or entrance to a school of higher education. I have to stop myself from pretending to snore a couple of times, and I wonder how Westford can sit here and listen to Morrisey\u2019s bullshit with a straight face.</p><p>\u201cAnd just so you\u2019re aware,\u201d Morrisey says as he pulls out a student handbook and goes through each page, \u201cwe\u2019ll be doing random drug tests on all REACH students throughout the year. If we find an illegal substance in your system or on your person at any time, your guardian will be notified and you\u2019ll be kicked out of REACH and expelled from school. Permanently. Most teens end up locked up for any violations.\u201d</p><p>Morrisey hands both Westford and me a copy of the REACH rules. Then he folds his hands on his big belly and smiles, but that smile doesn\u2019t fool me. He\u2019s a hard-ass who takes no prisoners. \u201cAny questions?\u201d he asks, his voice even . . . but I have no doubt that voice can bellow commands louder than any drill sergeant.</p><p>The Professor looks to me, then says, \u201cI think we\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Then we have one more piece of business before you can go back to school.\u201d He slides a piece of paper toward us. \u201cThis is a responsibility contract stating that I\u2019ve gone through the REACH rules, that you understand them, and you agree to abide by them.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, I notice three signature lines. One for me, one for a parent or guardian, and one for a REACH staff member. The paper reads:</p><p>I, _______________________, certify that by signing below I agree to abide by the rules outlined in the REACH Handbook. I understand the rules, which have been properly explained to me by a REACH staff member. I further acknowledge that if I disregard the rules for any reason I will be subject to disciplinary action which may include in-house detention, additional counseling, and/or expulsion from the REACH program.</p><p>What it really means:</p> <p>I, __________________, sign my freedom over to REACH staff. By signing this piece of paper, I certify that my life will be dictated by other people and I\u2019ll live a miserable existence while I\u2019m in Colorado.</p><p>I don\u2019t think too hard about it as I scribble my name on the sheet and slide it over so Westford can sign it, too. I just want to be done with it already, so I can move on. There\u2019s no use trying to argue. After the paper is signed and tucked in my file, we\u2019re ushered out and I\u2019m ordered to report to REACH no later than three p.m. Monday through Friday, or I\u2019ll be in violation.</p><p>I figure I have so many rules stacked up, it\u2019s only a matter of time until I violate one.</p><p>20</p><p>Kiara</p><p>I haven\u2019t seen Carlos since school started. Everyone at school is buzzing about Friday\u2019s drug bust, and wondering what happened to Flatiron High\u2019s newest senior. I heard one person in the hallway say that Carlos spent the weekend in jail and didn\u2019t make bond; another said he was deported for being an illegal alien. I keep quiet about Carlos coming to live with us, even though I\u2019d like to tell everyone to shut up and stop spreading false rumors.</p><p>At lunch, Tuck and I are sitting at our usual table.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be your male model on Friday,\u201d he tells me.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom wants me to help with an adventure group she\u2019s leading this weekend. They don\u2019t have enough instructors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ladies at The Highlands are going to be crushed,\u201d I tell him. When I told them they\u2019d have two live models for our painting class, they got really excited. Even after I told them the models would be me and my friend Tuck, and no, we weren\u2019t going to be in the nude but in costumes.</p><p>\u201cGet someone else to do it with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it!\u201d he says. \u201cAsk Carlos to be your partner.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo way. He\u2019s seriously pissed about getting busted on Friday. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s in the mood to do favors for other people. Every time he challenges me I feel like I\u2019m going to stutter.\u201d</p><p>Tuck chuckles. \u201cIf no words come, you can always give him the finger. Guys like Carlos respond well to hand gestures.\u201d</p><p>Just as he says it, Carlos walks in the cafeteria. Every single eye in the room turns to him.</p><p>If I were Carlos, I\u2019d avoid the lunchroom for at least a month. But I\u2019m not Carlos. You\u2019d think he didn\u2019t notice everyone staring at him and whispering about the latest Carlos gossip. He walks straight over to the table he usually sits at, without an apology to anyone. I admire his confidence.</p><p>None of the other guys acknowledges Carlos, until Ram slides over and invites Carlos to sit next to him. After that, the freak show seems to be over. Ram is a popular guy, and if Ram gives Carlos his approval, then suddenly getting busted doesn\u2019t mean Carlos is an outcast after all.</p><p>After lunch when Carlos is at his locker, I tap him on the shoulder. \u201cThanks for changing my combination back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it to be nice,\u201d he says. \u201cI did it so I wouldn\u2019t get busted and kicked out of school.\u201d</p><p>When Carlos started here a week ago, he didn\u2019t care whether he attended classes or got kicked out. Now that getting expelled is a real possibility, he\u2019s fighting to stay here. I wonder if the threat of getting kicked out makes him want to stay more.</p><p>21</p><p>Carlos</p><p>Mr. Kinney, my assigned social worker, greets me in the REACH lobby after I sign in. In his office, he places a yellow piece of paper in front of me. My name is on the top, and four blank lines are below it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I ask. I\u2019ve already signed my life away; what more could they want?</p><p>\u201cA goal sheet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoal sheet.\u201d Kinney hands me a pencil. \u201cI want you to write down four goals you have. You don\u2019t have to do it now. Think about it tonight, and hand it in tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I hand the sheet back to the guy. \u201cI don\u2019t got any goals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has goals,\u201d he tells me. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t, you should. Goals help give your life direction and purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I have any I\u2019m not about to share \u2019em with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat attitude won\u2019t get you anywhere,\u201d Kinney says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because I don\u2019t plan on goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just livin\u2019 in the moment, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes living in the moment include going to jail on a drug charge?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Carlos. Every student in the REACH program is at-risk,\u201d Kinney says. I follow him down a stark white hallway.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelf-destructive behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think you can fix me?\u201d</p><p>Kinney gives me a serious look. \u201cOur goal is not to fix you, Carlos. We\u2019ll supply you with the tools to reach your full potential, but the rest is up to you. Ninety percent of the students in our program end up graduating without a single violation. We\u2019re very proud of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey only graduate because you force them to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Believe it or not, it\u2019s human nature to want to succeed. Some of the teens here are like you. They\u2019ve gotten mixed up in gangs and drugs and need a safe after-school environment. And sometimes, just sometimes, it\u2019s because teens don\u2019t have the tools to deal with the stress of being a teenager. We give them a place where they can succeed and go on to reach their full potential.\u201d</p><p>No wonder Alex was so excited for me to come here. He wants me to conform . . . graduate from high school, go to college, get a respectable job, then get married and have kids. But I\u2019m not him. I wish everyone would stop treatin\u2019 me as if my goal should be to live my life according to Alex.</p><p>Kinney leads me to a room with six misfits sitting in a cozy little circle. A woman with a long, flowy skirt who reminds me of Mrs. Westford is sitting with them, a notebook resting on her lap.</p><p>\u201cThis some kind of group therapy?\u201d I quietly ask Kinney.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Berger, this is Carlos,\u201d Kinney says. \u201cHe just enrolled this morning.\u201d</p><p>Berger smiles that same smile Morrisey flashed me in his office this morning. \u201cTake a seat, Carlos,\u201d she says. \u201cDuring group therapy you can talk about anything that\u2019s on your mind. Please, sit down.\u201d</p><p>Oh, goodie! Group therapy! I can\u2019t wait!</p><p>I am seriously gonna puke.</p><p>When Kinney leaves, Berger asks everyone to introduce themselves to me, as if I care what their names are. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Justin,\u201d the kid to my right says.</p><p>Justin has his long hair dyed green in front. The front is so long, it\u2019s like he\u2019s got a curtain in front of his eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019re you in for? Drugs? Petty theft? Grand larceny? Murder?\u201d I say as if crimes are things you can order at a restaurant.</p><p>Berger puts her hand up. \u201cCarlos, it\u2019s REACH policy not to ask those questions.\u201d</p> <p>Oops, I must have been daydreaming during that portion of The Lecture. \u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask. \u201cI say lay it all on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAuto theft,\u201d Justin blurts out to our surprise. I think even Justin is surprised he shared his little secret.</p><p>After everyone introduces themselves, I come to the conclusion that I\u2019ve just been assigned the Group from Hell. To my left is a white chick named Zana who could easily be cast if they ever decide to make a reality show called Colorado Sluts. Next is Quinn\u2014 I can\u2019t tell if Quinn is a he or a she. There are two other Latinos\u2014a guy named Keno and a hot Mexican chica named Carmela with chocolate brown eyes and honey brown skin. She reminds me of my ex, Destiny, except Carmela\u2019s got a troublemaking glint in her eye that Destiny never had.</p><p>Berger puts down her pen and says to me, \u201cBefore you joined us, Justin was sharing the fact that he punches his fist into walls sometimes when he\u2019s frustrated, so he can feel pain. We were talking about other outlets for frustration that are less destructive.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s a little ironic that Justin will hit a wall because he\u2019s desperate to feel something, anything, even pain . . . I\u2019m just the opposite. I do anything and everything in my power not to feel anything. My goal most times is to be numb.</p> <p>Hmm, maybe I should write that one down on my goal sheet. Carlos Fuentes\u2019s goal #1: To be numb and stay numb. I don\u2019t think that\u2019ll go over too well, but it\u2019s the truth.</p><p>\u201cSo how was your first day?\u201d</p><p>After Alex picked me up from REACH at five thirty, he took me to what I assume is downtown Boulder\u2014 a place called Pearl Street Mall. To the delight of Mrs. Westford, we stopped at her Hospitali-Tea store/caf\u00e9 for a drink and sit at one of the tables on the outdoor patio. Tea is not the kind of drink I had in mind, but as usual I don\u2019t have much choice.</p><p>Mrs. Westford puts down two specialty teas she made \u201con the house, just for us\u201d and heads back inside to take orders from other customers.</p><p>I look at my brother as he sits across from me, totally relaxed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of fuckin\u2019 misfits at that REACH thing, Alex,\u201d I tell him quietly so Mrs. W. doesn\u2019t hear. \u201cOne is worse than the next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on, it can\u2019t be that bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that until you see \u2019em. And they made me sign this stupid-ass agreement that I\u2019ll abide by their rules. Remember back in Fairfield when we had no rules, Alex? After school it was just you, me, and Luis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had rules,\u201d Alex says, then picks up his drink. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t follow \u2019em. Mi'am\u00e1 was workin\u2019 so much, she wasn\u2019t around to keep an eye on us.\u201d</p><p>We didn\u2019t live like kings back in Illinois, but we sure did have family and friends . . . and a life. \u201cI want to go back.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 left there for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElena and Jorge are there with little JJ. You\u2019ve never even seen the kid, Alex. My friends are there. I\u2019ve got less than nothin\u2019 here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sayin\u2019 I don\u2019t want to go back,\u201d my brother says. \u201cWe just can\u2019t go back now. It\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when did you become afraid? Man, you\u2019ve changed. I remember when you\u2019d tell the entire world to fuck off and do whatever you wanted without thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared. I care about bein\u2019 here for Brittany. There\u2019s a point when you have to stop fightin\u2019 the whole world. I reached that point two years ago. Look around, Carlos. There are other girls besides Destiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Destiny. Not anymore. If you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about Kiara, forget it. I\u2019m not datin\u2019 a chick who wants to control my life and cares whether I\u2019m dealin\u2019 drugs or in a gang. Look at us, Alex. We\u2019re sittin\u2019 at a fuckin\u2019 teahouse next to rich white people who don\u2019t have a clue what it\u2019s like outside this fake reality they call life. You\u2019ve become a chido.\u201d</p><p>Alex leans forward. \u201cLet me tell you somethin\u2019, little brother. I like not havin\u2019 to watch my back every time I walk down the street. I like that I have a novia who thinks I\u2019m the shit. And I sure as hell don\u2019t regret givin\u2019 up the drugs and the Latino Blood for a chance at a future worth livin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna bleach your skin so you can look like a gringo, too?\u201d I ask. \u201cMan, I hope your kids are as pale as Brittany so you don\u2019t have to sell \u2019em on the black market.\u201d</p><p>My brother is gettin\u2019 pissed off, I can tell by the way the muscle in his jaw is twitching. \u201cBeing Mexican doesn\u2019t mean being poor,\u201d he says. \u201cGoin\u2019 to college doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m turnin\u2019 my back on my people. Maybe you\u2019re turnin\u2019 your back on our people by perpetuatin\u2019 the Mexican stereotype.\u201d</p><p>I moan and throw my head back. \u201cPerpetuatin\u2019? Perpetuatin\u2019? Hell, Alex, our people don\u2019t even know the meanin\u2019 of that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Alex growls. He shoves back his chair and walks away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the old Alex I used to know! I understand that language loud and clear,\u201d I call after him.</p><p>He tosses his cup in a garbage bin and keeps walking. I admit he doesn\u2019t walk like a gringo yet and still looks like he could kick anyone\u2019s ass who gets in his way. But just give it time. He\u2019ll look like he\u2019s got a pole up his ass any day now.</p><p>Mrs. Westford is soon back at the table, gazing into my untouched cup. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like your tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She notices the now-empty seat. \u201cWhat happened to Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she says, then pulls up his empty chair and sits next to me. \u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant my advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d What am I going to do, tell her that tomorrow I\u2019m going to sneak into Nick\u2019s locker to see if I can find evidence that he set me up? While I\u2019m at it, I might as well rummage through Madison\u2019s locker too. Since she was so intent on having me and Nick meet, maybe she knows something. I\u2019m not sharing my suspicions with anyone.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but if you do, just let me know. Wait here.\u201d She takes my untouched cup and disappears inside. That was a shocker. Mi'am\u00e1 is the opposite of Mrs. Westford. If my ma wants to give me advice, you can be damn well sure she\u2019s gonna dish it out whether I want to listen or not.</p><p>Mrs. Westford comes back a minute later and sets down another cup full of tea.</p><p>\u201cJust try it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s got calming herbs like chamomile, rose hips, elderberries, lemon balm, and Siberian ginseng.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather smoke weed,\u201d I joke.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t laugh. \u201cI know smoking pot isn\u2019t a big deal to some people, but at this point it\u2019s illegal.\u201d She slides the cup further toward me. \u201cI guarantee this will calm you,\u201d she says. As she walks back inside to wait on other customers she adds, \u201cAnd it won\u2019t get you in a heap of trouble.\u201d</p><p>I look down into the cup filled with light green liquid. It doesn\u2019t look like herbs, it just looks like tea from a cheap ol\u2019 teabag. I look left and right, makin\u2019 sure nobody is watching, as I bring the cup to my face and breathe in the steam.</p><p>Okay, this is no ordinary tea from a cheap teabag. It smells like fruit and flowers and somethin\u2019 else I can\u2019t place all rolled into one. And while the smell is unfamiliar, it makes my mouth water.</p><p>I look up and see Tuck walking toward me. Kiara is beside him, but her attention is on a guy in the middle of the outdoor mall playing the accordion. She pulls a dollar from her purse and kneels down to put it in his case.</p><p>While she stops to watch the guy play, Tuck pulls over a chair from another table and sits across from me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have pegged you as a tea guy,\u201d Tuck says. \u201cYou look like more of a tequila and rum guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have other people to annoy?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The dude, who I don\u2019t think has cut his hair in at least nine months, reaches out and pokes at the tattoo on my forearm. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>I flick his hand away. \u201cIt means if you touch me again I\u2019m gonna kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Kiara is now standing behind Tuck\u2019s chair. She doesn\u2019t look happy.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of kicking ass, how was your first day at REACH?\u201d Tuck asks, with a grin that makes me want to tip over his chair.</p><p>Kiara grabs his sleeve and yanks him away from the table. He falls off the chair. \u201cKiara has to ask you something, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I don\u2019t,\u201d Kiara chokes out, then grabs him again and starts pulling him into the store.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. Ask him,\u201d he says before they both stumble into the store and out of my view.</p><p>22</p><p>Kiara</p><p>I push Tuck inside. \u201cStop it,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>We\u2019re at the back of the store now, where nobody else can hear us.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Tuck asks. \u201cYou need a guy to stand in front of old people with you, and he needs something to do besides sit around and count his tattoos all day. It\u2019s a perfect idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>My mom shimmies her way next to us and hugs Tuck. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help Kiara with her painting class on Friday, so she wants to ask Carlos to take my place,\u201d Tuck says.</p><p>A big smile crosses my mom\u2019s lips. \u201cOh, honey, that\u2019s so nice of you to include him in your activities. You\u2019re so special.\u201d She squeezes me in a huge bear hug. \u201cIsn\u2019t my daughter the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely, Mrs. Westford. The best.\u201d</p><p>Tuck is such a suck-up when it comes to my parents.</p><p>\u201cKiara, when you and Tuck are done here, take Carlos home. He was with Alex, but I think they had a disagreement or something. I\u2019ll be leaving in about an hour, but I need to pick up Brandon from his friend\u2019s house and your father is making dinner. Oh, and once you get home, you might want to supervise so there\u2019s something edible for us.\u201d</p><p>After my mom makes us tea, I find Carlos outside drinking what I suspect is one of my mother\u2019s special blends. He seems to like it, although I can\u2019t be sure because his face is an emotionless mask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Tuck says, saluting me with his paper cup.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you want to ask me?\u201d Carlos asks. He sounds annoyed.</p><p>Will you dress up as a cowboy on Friday night and model in front of old people? \u201cNothing.\u201d I just can\u2019t get the words out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mom comes out to chat with customers. I watch as she makes conversation with each and every person as if she\u2019s their personal friend. When she reaches our table, she leans down to make sure we\u2019re drinking our tea.</p><p>\u201cI see you liked it,\u201d she says to Carlos. My mom takes such pride in her tea blends that if she finds the right custom blend for a hard-to-please customer, it makes her feel like she\u2019s won the lottery. \u201cI understand Kiara wants to ask you to be a model for her on Friday at The Highlands. It should be fun.\u201d</p><p>Carlos gives me a what the hell is she talkin\u2019 about? look.</p><p>\u201cWant more tea?\u201d my mom asks him.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiara can drive you home. Right, sweetie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s go,\u201d I say before my mother says anything more.</p><p>When we reach my car, Carlos tries to pull on the passenger-door handle.</p><p>\u201cYou have to climb through the window,\u201d I tell him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re kiddin\u2019 me, right?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d That\u2019s my next project, after I fix the clock and radio.\u201d</p><p>Carlos climbs in the car with ease, his feet entering first before his whole body slides into the vinyl bucket seat. I wish the radio or old tape player worked, because I think Carlos is getting anxious after five minutes of me driving in silence.</p><p>He shifts in the seat. \u201cWhat\u2019s this modelin\u2019 thing about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s modeling for a nursing-home painting class on Friday night. You don\u2019t have to do it. I wasn\u2019t even going to ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re at a stop sign, so I turn to him and say the truth. \u201cBecause you\u2019d be posing with me, and I knew you wouldn\u2019t agree to do it.\u201d</p><p>23</p><p>Carlos</p><p>I get it. She wouldn\u2019t want to pose with a guy who\u2019d get busted for drugs. \u201cI can bring Madison,\u201d I tell her in the cocky tone I know grates on her nerves. \u201cShe\u2019d pose with me. On second thought, she invited me to her house Friday night, so I can\u2019t make your little paintin\u2019 party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you see in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot more than I see in you,\u201d I lie to push her away. Truth is, I don\u2019t see anything in Madison. I\u2019ve been trying to avoid the girl since she puked at her party, but since she\u2019s on my list of people who might have framed me, I\u2019ve got to get closer to her. Kiara doesn\u2019t need to know that. Hell, Kiara shouldn\u2019t know I\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 about her and her cookies way more than I ever should.</p><p>When we arrive at the house, Kiara storms out of the car.</p><p>I get a snack in the kitchen a little while later and see Kiara cutting vegetables. I wonder if she\u2019d like to see my head on that board along with the carrots.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Carlos,\u201d the Professor says when he walks in. \u201cHow was REACH?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sucked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you be more specific?\u201d my guardian asks.</p><p>\u201cIt really sucked,\u201d I elaborate, sarcasm dripping from every word.</p><p>\u201cYour vocabulary astounds me,\u201d he says. \u201cHey, I need both your help today after dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cPulling weeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you rich people have gardeners to do that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The answer is no, because after dinner Westford escorts us to the backyard with big paper bags.</p><p>He tosses canvas gloves to me and Kiara. \u201cI\u2019ll take the side yard. Kiara, you and Carlos tackle the back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Brandon yells out from the patio door. \u201cCarlos said he\u2019d play soccer with me today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Bran. Carlos has to help pull weeds in the yard,\u201d Westford says to the little kid.</p><p>\u201cYou can help,\u201d Kiara says to him. Brandon looks all too happy to help her.</p><p>I remember when I was younger and Alex invited me to help him do yard work. He always made me feel useful. \u201cYo, Brandon, I could use your help, too,\u201d I say. \u201cAfter you help me, I\u2019ll play with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d the little kid says.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just make sure the bag is wide open so when I toss in the weeds they fall in the bag.\u201d</p><p>He rushes over to the bag and holds it open. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Kiara is on her hands and knees, pulling weeds and tossing them in her own bag. I can\u2019t imagine Madison ever kneeling in dirt and subjecting herself to manual labor. I also can\u2019t imagine her having a vintage car that doesn\u2019t even have a usable passenger door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going too slow,\u201d Brandon observes. \u201cI bet Kiara has more weeds in her bag than you have in yours.\u201d The kid runs over to inspect the inside of Kiara\u2019s bag. \u201cShe\u2019s winning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long.\u201d I grab a bunch of weeds and rip them out of the ground. A few have prickly stems pokin\u2019 me through the gloves, but I don\u2019t care.</p><p>I look over at Kiara, workin\u2019 faster than before. She\u2019s definitely showing her competitive side.</p><p>\u201cDone!\u201d she yells out, standing up at the left side of the yard and pulling the gardening gloves off with attitude. She picks Brandon up and twirls him around until they both fall on the grass laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou better be careful, Kiara,\u201d I call out to her. \u201cYour personality is startin\u2019 to show.\u201d</p><p>While Brandon\u2019s back is turned, Kiara flashes me the one-finger salute as she walks to her car.</p><p>I have definitely gotten on her bad side.</p><p>\u201cNow we can play soccer! Go by the goal,\u201d Brandon says, pointing to the little net in the yard. \u201cRemember, if I get it past you, you said you\u2019d play G.I. Joe with me.\u201d</p><p>I stand by the goal while Brandon tries kicking the ball past me. I have to give the little dude credit. He tries until he\u2019s sweating and panting, never giving up even though it\u2019s a lost cause.</p><p>\u201cThis time I\u2019m gonna do it,\u201d he says for the fiftieth time. He points to something behind me. \u201cLook! Over there!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the oldest trick in the book, little man.\u201d I appreciate his attempt at cheating, but he picked the wrong guy.</p><p>\u201cNo, really. Look!\u201d Brandon cries out.</p><p>He sounds convincing, but I\u2019m still not taking my eye off of his soccer ball. I\u2019d rather block shots all day than play with dolls.</p><p>He kicks the ball, but I block it once again. \u201cSorry, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandon, time for your bath,\u201d Mrs. Westford yells from the patio.</p><p>\u201cJust a few more kicks, Mom. Please.\u201d</p><p>She looks at her watch. \u201cTwo more, then bath time. I\u2019m sure Carlos has homework to do.\u201d</p><p>After two more unsuccessful attempts, I tell Brandon to give up. He skips into the house. He\u2019s pretty coordinated, but I wonder at what age boys realize they\u2019re just not supposed to skip. On my way upstairs, I pass the dining room. Kiara is sitting at the big table, her head in a bunch of thick textbooks.</p><p>Strands of hair have escaped her ponytail, falling in her face. It makes me wonder what she\u2019d look like with it all down.</p><p>She glances up, then snaps her head back down.</p><p>\u201cYou should wear your hair down,\u201d I tell her. \u201cYou might look more like Madison that way.\u201d</p><p>She answers by flipping me off again.</p><p>I laugh. \u201cBe careful,\u201d I warn. \u201cI hear in some countries every time you do that, they chop off a finger.\u201d</p><p>I wait two days to break into Nick\u2019s and Madison\u2019s lockers, thanks to one of Kiara\u2019s cookie magnets (minus the cookie) and a small screwdriver I took from Kiara\u2019s car. In the middle of third period, I ask to go to the bathroom but end up searching Madison\u2019s locker. In her book bag are books, makeup, and a bunch of notes from Lacey and other girls. In a stroke of luck, she left her cell in the side pocket of her bag. I grab her phone and take it with me to the bathroom, where I scroll through her call log texts, calendar, and contacts. Nothing out of the ordinary here, except that Friday after school she called Nick more times than I can count on two hands.</p><p>I put her phone back before I head to class.</p><p>That leaves Nick. I see him briefly in the halls at school and have been staking out his locker, but I don\u2019t have classes with the guy. During lunch hour the halls are too busy, but right after lunch I sneak into the halls and put the magnet and screwdriver to use again.</p><p>Nick\u2019s locker is a damn mess. In his backpack are a bunch of names scribbled on pieces of paper with codes on them. They\u2019re probably his customers or suppliers, but they\u2019re all written in that stupid code.</p><p>I\u2019ve been here too long already. But I feel close, as if Paco or Pap\u00e1 is driving me to look further. I dig through his backpack, hoping to find his phone or some other evidence that he was connected to my getting busted. But all I find are a bunch of papers.</p><p>Someone is coming up the stairs. I can hear footsteps coming closer. If it\u2019s the principal, I\u2019m busted. If it\u2019s Nick, I\u2019d better be ready for a fight. I quickly thumb through the mess of papers, until . . . yeah, I got it.</p><p>It\u2019s the one scrap of paper that\u2019s not in code. It\u2019s someone\u2019s name that I\u2019m all too familiar with . . . Wes Devlin, a drug lord with deep connections to the Guerreros del barrio, and a phone number written right below it.</p><p>I shove the number in my pocket, then close the locker right before someone comes up the stairs.</p><p>Nick better watch out, \u2019cause very soon I\u2019m gonna pay him a visit . . . one that he won\u2019t forget anytime soon.</p><p>24</p><p>Kiara</p><p>After school on Wednesday, I\u2019m washing my car in my driveway when Alex drops off Carlos after REACH. Alex comes over to me and picks up an extra sponge.</p><p>\u201cYour dad said you\u2019re havin\u2019 problems with the radio even after I put the spring in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I love my car, but . . . \u201cIt\u2019s imperfectly perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s one way to describe it. Sounds like some people I know.\u201d Alex peers inside the car. \u201cBrittany\u2019s car is fast, but this thing has some juice left.\u201d He sits in one of the bucket seats. \u201cI could get used to this. One of our customers has a \u201973 Monte Carlo for sale. I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 about buyin\u2019 it. Did Carlos tell you he worked at my cousin\u2019s auto body back in Chicago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised. Carlos always hung out with Enrique at the shop. He loves workin\u2019 on cars probably more than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have somewhere else to be?\u201d Carlos asks. He\u2019s been leaning against our garage this entire time. I know this because, well, when Carlos is anywhere near me I can sense it.</p><p>I\u2019ve purposely been avoiding him since Monday, which has been working out fine for both of us.</p><p>When Alex leaves a little later, Carlos steps forward. \u201cNeed help?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever gonna talk to me again? Dammit, Kiara, enough with the silent treatment. I\u2019d rather have you say your little two-word sentences than stop talkin\u2019 altogether. Hell, just flip me off again.\u201d</p><p>I toss my backpack in the backseat and start the engine.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you goin\u2019?\u201d Carlos asks, stepping in front of my car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I beep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not movin\u2019,\u201d he says.</p><p>My response is another beep. It\u2019s not an intimidating, deep beep like most cars, but it\u2019s the best my car can give.</p><p>He places both hands on the hood.</p> <p>\u201cMove,\u201d I say.</p><p>He moves all right. With pantherlike quickness, Carlos jumps through the open passenger window, feet first. \u201cYou should get the door fixed,\u201d he says.</p><p>Guess he\u2019s coming along for the ride. I pull out of the driveway and head into Boulder Canyon. The wind is blowing through the open windows, the fresh air hitting me in the face and whipping my ponytail against the back of my neck.</p><p>\u201cI could fix the door,\u201d Carlos tells me. He puts his hand out the window, letting the wind rush through his fingers.</p><p>I drive up Boulder Canyon Road in silence, taking in the scenery. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be immune to the beauty of it after living here so long, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve always felt a strange fascination and peace with the mountains.</p> <p>I park by The Dome; I occasionally mountain climb with Tuck here. I reach in the backseat to get my backpack and step out of the car.</p><p>Carlos sticks his head out the window. \u201cI\u2019m assumin\u2019 this isn\u2019t your destination.\u201d</p><p>I admit I get a little satisfaction when I say, \u201cGuess again.\u201d Slinging on my backpack, I start walking toward the bridge suspended over Boulder Creek.</p><p>\u201cYo, chica,\u201d he calls after me.</p><p>I keep walking, heading for my sanctuary in the mountains.</p><p>\u201c\u00a1Carajo!\u201d I don\u2019t turn around, but by the sounds he\u2019s making and the Spanish swear words flying out of his mouth I can tell he\u2019s trying to open the passenger door to get out. He\u2019s hopelessly unsuccessful. When he climbs out the window and falls on the makeshift gravel parking lot, I hear him curse again.</p> <p>\u201cKiara, dammit, wait up!\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m at the base of the mountain now, at the beginning of my usual route.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I point to the sign, then start toward the big boulders.</p><p>I can hear him slipping on pebbles as he tries to keep up. We\u2019re on the trail now, but soon I\u2019m going to veer off and follow my private path. He\u2019s definitely not wearing appropriate hiking shoes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some serious problems, chica,\u201d he growls.</p><p>I keep walking. When I\u2019m halfway to my destination, I stop and pull out a water bottle from my backpack. It\u2019s not too hot, and I\u2019m used to the altitude, but I\u2019ve seen people get dehydrated here and it\u2019s not pretty.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I say, holding the bottle out to him.</p><p>\u201cAre you kiddin\u2019 me? You probably poisoned it.\u201d</p> <p>I take a long gulp, then offer it to him again. He makes a big deal of wiping the mouth of the bottle with the bottom of his T-shirt, as if I have cooties; then he takes a long drink.</p><p>When he hands it back, I make a bigger deal of wiping off his germs with the bottom of my own T-shirt. I think I hear him chuckle. Either that or he\u2019s covering up his heavy breathing from the climb.</p><p>When I start walking again, Carlos is huffing and puffing. \u201cIs this fun for you? \u2019Cause this is definitely not my idea of a good time.\u201d</p><p>I keep up my pace. Every time Carlos slips, he curses. You\u2019d think he\u2019d concentrate hard on hiking and not slipping on the rocks, but he keeps jabbering on.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you it\u2019s annoyin\u2019 that you hardly say anythin\u2019 to me anymore? You\u2019re like a mute who doesn\u2019t use any hand gestures. I mean, seriously, it\u2019s irritatin\u2019 the hell outta me. Don\u2019t you think I have enough to deal with, bein\u2019 framed, arrested, and havin\u2019 to go to that stupid REACH program?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I come to the place where I have to go over a small ledge and grab on to overhanging rocks for support. I\u2019m fully supported and even if I fall it\u2019s only a few feet down to a flat area.</p><p>\u201cIs this a joke?\u201d he asks, following my lead just because at this point he probably doesn\u2019t think he has a choice. \u201cAre we goin\u2019 somewhere, or are you just wanderin\u2019 around aimlessly until I slip and plunge to my death?\u201d</p><p>Climbing over the big rock that shields my spot from hikers, I stop when I reach the open area with a big, lone tree. I stumbled upon this place years ago, when I needed a place to just come and . . . think. Now I come a lot. I do homework here, I draw, I listen to the birds, and I take in the smell of fresh mountain air.</p><p>I sit on a flat rock, open my backpack, and place the water bottle next to me. I open my calculus book and start doing my homework.</p><p>\u201cAre you actually studyin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cLook around.\u201d</p><p>He quickly looks left and right. \u201cI don\u2019t see nothin\u2019 but rocks and trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your keys,\u201d he demands. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>I ignore him.</p><p>I hear him huff and puff. He could easily overpower me, grab my backpack, and fish the keys out himself. But he doesn\u2019t.</p><p>I keep my head in my book, going through equations and writing notes on scratch paper.</p><p>Carlos takes a deep breath. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry. Perd\u00f3n. Madison and I are history, and I\u2019d much rather model with you than hang out with her. Wow, being in nature has restored my faith in humanity and made me a better person. Now are you happy?\u201d</p><p>25</p><p>Carlos</p><p>I watch as Kiara closes her book, looks up at me, then reaches in her backpack. She tosses me the keys to her car. I catch them with one hand.</p><p>\u201cYou just gonna stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leavin\u2019,\u201d I warn her.</p><p>\u201cSo go,\u201d she says, waving.</p><p>I will. I sure as hell am not waitin\u2019 for her to finish studying. I\u2019m hot, sweaty, and totally pissed off. And I\u2019m thinking of ways to get revenge, the first of which is taking her car and makin\u2019 sure it comes back without a lick of gas.</p><p>Shoving the keys into my back pocket, I start to climb down. I slide a few times and fall on my ass. I\u2019m gonna have more than one bruise in the morning, thanks to Kiara.</p><p>I briefly feel sorry for that dude Tuck for having to deal with her, but then I figure they deserve each other. My thoughts turn to Destiny. If she was up on this mountain all alone, I wouldn\u2019t let her out of my sight. I\u2019d play her knight in shining armor. Hell, I\u2019d even carry her up the mountain on my back if that\u2019s what she wanted.</p><p>And while Kiara isn\u2019t my girlfriend and never will be, I can\u2019t just leave her. I know there are bears here. What if she gets attacked by one? Did she seriously expect me to leave, or is this a test to see what a good guy I am?</p><p>She\u2019s outta luck \u2019cause I\u2019m not a good guy.</p><p>I keep slippin\u2019 down the mountain. Just when I think I\u2019ve found a path, I get to a dead end or a fucking cliff.</p><p>I grab a rock and chuck it. Then another one. And another. Hearing the echo of them bouncing off the rocks below eases my frustration just a fraction.</p><p>I take off my shirt, wipe my forehead, and tuck the shirt into the back of my jeans.</p><p>I\u2019m not in Mexico anymore, that\u2019s for sure. Nobody I know would wander in the fucking mountains just to study. Now, if the aim was to do drugs or get drunk, I could understand it.</p><p>I storm back up the rocks, cursing the lack of traction in my shoes, and cursing Alex, mi'am\u00e1, and Kiara, and just about everyone else I\u2019ve ever met.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re loco, chica,\u201d I yell when I climb back over the rock that shields her private spot. \u201cI mean, seriously, did you expect me to follow you up here just so you could toss me the keys to your car and leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to follow me,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cLike I had a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both have f-f-free will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, my free will got taken away the minute I got on that plane to Colorado.\u201d</p><p>I sit on the ground, facing her. Kiara continues taking notes. We came up here together, and we\u2019re gonna leave here together. I\u2019m not gonna like it, but at this point I don\u2019t see any other option. Every once in a while she looks up and catches me staring at her. Yeah, I\u2019m doing it to make her uncomfortable. Maybe if I annoy her enough she\u2019ll want to pack up and leave.</p><p>But after five minutes I can tell my strategy isn\u2019t workin\u2019.</p><p>Time to change tactics. \u201cWant to make out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith who?\u201d she asks, not bothering to look up.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her head from her book just long enough to give me a once-over. \u201cNo, thanks,\u201d she says, then goes back to her homework.</p><p>She\u2019s fuckin\u2019 with me.</p><p>She\u2019s got to be fuckin\u2019 with me, right? \u201cBecause of that pendejo Tuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because I don\u2019t want Madison\u2019s leftovers.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Un. Momento. I\u2019ve been called a lot of things before, but . . . \u201cYou callin\u2019 me leftovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Besides, Tuck is a great kisser. I wouldn\u2019t want you to feel bad when there\u2019s no way you can compete.\u201d</p><p>That guy hardly owns a pair of lips. \u201cWanna bet?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m anything but leftovers. After we moved to Mexico and Destiny broke up with me, all I did was date one girl after another. Hell, I could write a book on kissing chicas if I wanted to.</p><p>I lean toward Kiara and get a small dose of satisfaction when I hear her breath hitch and notice her pencil stop moving. She doesn\u2019t move an inch as my lips get close to that place right below her right earlobe. I reach up with my left hand and touch the sensitive spot below her left ear with my thumb while my lips hover over her neck. She can definitely feel my hot breath on her bare skin.</p><p>She tilts her head the slightest bit, giving me more access. I\u2019m not even sure she realized she\u2019s doing it. I stay where I am. She moans almost silently, but I don\u2019t give in. She\u2019s definitely being turned on. She likes this. And she wants more. But I\u2019m holding back . . . leftovers, my ass.</p><p>The problem is, I\u2019m not prepared for what Kiara smells like. Usually girls smell too much like flowers or vanilla, but Kiara has a distinctly sweet raspberry scent that\u2019s totally turning me on. And while my mind is telling me I\u2019m flirting with her just to prove a point, my body wants to play \u201cyou show me your perky privates and I\u2019ll show you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-d-do you m-m-mind?\u201d she says. She might be trying to mask her reaction to me being so close, but her words betray her. \u201cI\u2019m trying to work and you\u2019re blocking my sun,\u201d she whispers. I\u2019m guessin\u2019 she doesn\u2019t stutter when she whispers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in the shade, under a tree,\u201d I say, but pull away anyway because I need to cool down and stay in control.</p><p>I lean back against a rock, the rough edges rubbing into my bare back. I bend one knee and get in a relaxed position even though I\u2019m anything but relaxed. While I\u2019m trying to get comfortable, Kiara is still sitting under that damn tree doin\u2019 her homework. She\u2019s not sweating at all, and she appears totally relaxed. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m hot because of what just happened, or didn\u2019t happen, between us. Or if it\u2019s because of the weather. You\u2019d think I\u2019d be used to the hot weather from Mexico, but I was born in Chicago and spent most of my life there. The summers in Chi-Town are humid and hot, but it only lasts a few months. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My insides are going nuts. My heart is beating furiously and there\u2019s a crackling energy in the air that wasn\u2019t there before I leaned close to her.</p><p>What\u2019s going on? The altitude must be screwing with my head. I need to change the subject fast and direct the conversation away from anything sexual. \u201cSo what\u2019s the deal with your stutterin\u2019?\u201d I ask.</p><p>26</p><p>Kiara</p> <p>My pencil immediately stops moving. I try and concentrate on my calculus equation, but I can\u2019t focus on anything on the page. Nobody who wasn\u2019t a speech therapist has ever come right out and asked me about my stuttering before. I\u2019m not prepared to answer, especially because I don\u2019t know why I stutter. It\u2019s just who I am, how I was born, and everything in between.</p><p>Before Carlos asked about my stuttering, all I could think about was our almost-kiss. His hot breath seared my skin and made my stomach do flips. But he was just teasing me. I knew it and he knew it. So as much as I wanted desperately to turn my head and find out what his lips felt like on mine, I didn\u2019t want to humiliate myself.</p><p>I shove everything into my backpack, then sling the bag onto my back and head down the mountain.</p><p>I walk fast, hoping he\u2019ll fall far enough behind he\u2019ll have to concentrate on keeping up and not ask more questions. I made a huge mistake by bringing him here. It was impulsive and stupid. Worst of all, I didn\u2019t expect to want to kiss him more than anything in this world right before he confronted me about my stuttering.</p><p>I cross the bridge over Boulder Creek and head for my car. I reach in my backpack for my keys, but then realize Carlos still has them. I hold my hand out.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t give me the keys. Instead he leans against the car. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make deals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone makes deals, Kiara. Even smart girls who stutter.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe he brought it up again. I turn and head for home on foot. Carlos better drive my car back, because they\u2019ll tow it if it\u2019s parked there all night.</p><p>I hear Carlos swear again. \u201cCome back here,\u201d he says.</p><p>I keep walking.</p> <p>I hear my car tires spin on the gravel behind me. Carlos drives up next to me. He\u2019s got his shirt back on, which is good because I get distracted when he\u2019s half naked.</p><p>\u201cGet in, Kiara.\u201d</p><p>As I keep walking, he inches the car forward. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna get in an accident,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I give a shit?\u201d</p><p>I glance in his direction. \u201cNo. But I do. I love my car.\u201d</p><p>Someone beeps at him from behind. He doesn\u2019t flinch and keeps the car moving slowly beside me. At the first bend in the road, he screeches ahead of me and cuts me off. \u201cDon\u2019t test me,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get in right now, I\u2019m comin\u2019 out there to get you.\u201d We stare each other down, the muscle in the side of his jaw twitching in determination. \u201cIf you get in, I\u2019ll wash your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just washed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do your chores for a week, then,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t mind doing chores,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let your brother get a goal off of me and I\u2019ll play with his G.I. Joe dolls.\u201d</p><p>Every day Brandon has been trying to get a goal off of Carlos, with no luck. My little brother would love to beat Carlos. \u201cFine,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I drive.\u201d</p><p>He slides over the center console and hops in the passenger seat while I get behind the wheel. When I glance at him, I can\u2019t help but notice the look of triumph on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou know what your problem is?\u201d I\u2019m not surprised he doesn\u2019t wait for me to respond before he goes into his assessment of me. \u201cYou make everythin\u2019 a big deal. Take kissin\u2019, for example. You probably think if you kiss someone it\u2019s supposed to mean somethin\u2019 monumental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t just go around kissing people for fun like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Kiara, didn\u2019t anyone tell you that life is supposed to be fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have fun in other ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d he says in total disbelief. \u201cYou ever smoke weed?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cTake Ecstasy?\u201d</p><p>My top lip curls in disgust.</p><p>\u201cHave wild sex on top of a mountain?\u201d he questions.</p><p>\u201cYou have a demented view of fun, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cOkay, chica. What do you consider fun? Walkin\u2019 up mountains? Doin\u2019 your homework? Watchin\u2019 Madison make fun of you in class? I heard about that, you know.\u201d</p><p>I pull off the side of the road, my poor tires screeching to a stop. \u201cBeing rude . . . doesn\u2019t make y-y-you . . .\u201d I\u2019m about to get caught up on my words. I swallow, then take a deep breath. I hope the panic and frustration doesn\u2019t show as I stumble over my words. I know when it\u2019s coming, but I can\u2019t stop it. \u201c. . . tough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not aimin\u2019 for tough, Kiara. See, you pegged me all wrong. My goal is to be an asshole.\u201d He flashes me a big, cocky smile.</p><p>I shake my head in frustration and steer the car back on the road. At home, I find Dad playing with Brandon in the backyard.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you two been?\u201d my dad asks.</p><p>\u201cKiara took me hikin\u2019,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cRight, K.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little practice?\u201d my dad asks me, then explains to Carlos, \u201cWe\u2019re going on a family camping trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDick, I don\u2019t hike or camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he does play soccer.\u201d I tilt my head and smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me you were dying to play with Brandon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost forgot,\u201d Carlos says, the cocky grin gone.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s great,\u201d my dad says, patting Carlos on the back. \u201cIt\u2019ll mean so much to him. Bran, you ready to play soccer with Carlos?\u201d</p><p>We all look over at my brother, hurrying to set up the goal. \u201cAwesome! Carlos, I\u2019m gonna beat you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it, muchacho.\u201d Carlos kicks the ball and starts bouncing it up and down on his knees like a soccer pro. No matter what he claimed before, he\u2019s definitely played a lot.</p><p>\u201cI was practicing with my dad,\u201d Bran calls out. \u201cI\u2019m ready for you.\u201d</p><p>Practice or not, my little brother doesn\u2019t stand a chance against Carlos unless he purposely lets him win. I can\u2019t wait to see the triumph in my brother\u2019s face as he sails the ball past Carlos and scores a goal. I sit on the patio and watch as they warm up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have homework to do or somethin\u2019?\u201d Carlos asks.</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>He\u2019s definitely trying to challenge me in this little game of who\u2019s going to get the upper hand. \u201cI think I see some weeds that you missed on your side,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cKiara, come play with us!\u201d Brandon cries out.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s busy,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>Brandon looks at me in confusion. \u201cShe\u2019s just sitting watching us. How can she be busy?\u201d</p><p>Carlos has the ball under his arm now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just watch,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Brandon says, then runs over to me. He takes my hand and pulls me until I get up. \u201cPlay with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t know how to play,\u201d Carlos says to my brother.</p><p>\u201cSure she does. Give her the ball.\u201d</p><p>Carlos kicks it to me in the air. I dribble it on my knees, then bounce it off my head back to him. The guy looks stunned. And impressed. In a rare diva moment, I brush invisible dust off my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSurprise, surprise, Kiara can dribble,\u201d Carlos says as he positions himself in front of the goal. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holdin\u2019 out on me. Let\u2019s see you try and get it past me.\u201d</p><p>When I have the ball back, I kick it to Brandon. He kicks it back, then I whack it toward the goal.</p><p>Okay, so I\u2019m not really surprised Carlos intercepted it with hardly any effort. But now he\u2019s brushing invisible dust off his shoulders like I did and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get it to sail past him. \u201cWant a second chance?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cMaybe another day,\u201d I tell him. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m talking about that almost-kiss or about soccer.</p><p>Carlos\u2019s eyebrows go up, and I think he realizes my words have double meaning. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to the challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn!\u201d Brandon screams.</p><p>Carlos sets himself in front of the goal and leans over, deep in concentration. \u201cYou get three chances, but face the fact, Brandon. You\u2019re just not good enough.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, my brother\u2019s tongue shoots out the side of his mouth. He\u2019s deep in competitive/concentration mode. I\u2019m sure when he gets older he\u2019ll give Carlos a run for his money.</p><p>My brother sets the ball down and takes five steps back, counting each one. He kneels down as if he\u2019s a golfer lining up his shot. Is Carlos going to let him win? I\u2019ve had no signal or sign from him that our little agreement is still on, and he looks determined to stop my brother\u2019s ball.</p><p>\u201cGive up now, cachorro. You\u2019ll never get it past me, and then afterward you\u2019re going to call me the All-Powerful-Master-Goalie, the one, the only . . . Carlos Fuentes!\u201d</p><p>His taunting makes my brother even more determined; his lips are pressed tight and his hands are balled at his sides. He kicks the ball as hard as a six-year-old can, even grunting as his foot connects with the ball. It flies in the air.</p><p>Carlos flies in the air to catch it . . .</p><p>And misses by an inch. Even better, Carlos falls and rolls to his back as he comes crashing to the ground.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen a more triumphant expression on my brother\u2019s face. \u201cI did it!\u201d he screams. \u201cI did it! On the first try, even!\u201d He runs over to me and gives me a huge high five, then jumps on Carlos\u2019s back. \u201cI did it! I did it!\u201d</p><p>Carlos groans. \u201cYou ever hear of a sore winner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brandon leans down to Carlos\u2019s ear. \u201cThis means you get to play G.I. Joe with me tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we do a rematch?\u201d Carlos asks. \u201cLike two out of three. Or three out of five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, Jos\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s Carlos, not Jos\u00e9,\u201d Carlos says, but Brandon isn\u2019t listening. He\u2019s running inside the house to tell my parents that he beat Carlos.</p><p>Carlos is still on the ground when I kneel beside him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cTo say thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding up your end of the bargain by letting Brandon beat you. You pretty much succeed in being a jerk most of the time, but you\u2019ve got potential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be what?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cA decent human being.\u201d</p><p>27</p><p>Carlos</p><p>After dinner, I dig up the cell phone and call Luis and mi'am\u00e1.</p><p>\u201c\u00bfTe est\u00e1s ocupando de Mam\u00e1?\u201d I ask my little brother.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. I\u2019m takin\u2019 care of her.\u201d</p><p>Loud pounding on my door reminds me that I lost the competition this afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s G.I. Joe time, Carlos!\u201d Brandon\u2019s voice bellows through the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9n es \u00e9se?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe little kid who lives here. He reminds me of you sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s that good, huh?\u201d Luis says, then laughs. \u201cHow\u2019s Alex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex es buena gente. He\u2019s the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMa said you got in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, but everything will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. \u2019Cause she\u2019s savin\u2019 up to come there for the winter. If I\u2019m good, she said I can come, too. Podemos volver a ser familia, Carlos. Won\u2019t that be great?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it would be great if we could be a family again. A complete family to Luis is the four of us\u2014me, Mam\u00e1, Alex, and Luis. Our pap\u00e1 was dead before Luis could talk. I never want kids, because I\u2019d never want to leave behind a wife struggling to put food in my kids\u2019 mouths or have my kids think a family is complete without me in the picture.</p><p>Knock, knock, knock. Knock, knock, knock. \u201cYou in there?\u201d Brandon yells again, this time his voice coming through the bottom of my bedroom door. I can see his lips through the tiny space between the door and carpet. I should open the door with no warning and see the little diablo scramble to his feet.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be great if you and Mam\u00e1 can come here. D\u00e9jame hablar con Mam\u00e1.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not home. Est\u00e1 trabajando\u2014she\u2019s at work.\u201d</p><p>My heart wrenches. I don\u2019t want her working, slaving away for almost no pay. I provided for the family when I was in Mexico. Now I\u2019m going to school while she\u2019s working like a dog. It doesn\u2019t feel right.</p><p>\u201cTell her I called. \u00a1Que no se te olvide!\u201d I say, knowing my little brother is so busy havin\u2019 fun with his friends he\u2019s likely to forget I even called.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget. I promise.\u201d</p><p>We hang up as Brandon pounds on the door again. \u201cStop poundin\u2019, you\u2019re givin\u2019 me a headache,\u201d I say as I open the door.</p> <p>Brandon scrambles to his feet quicker than I\u2019ve ever seen anyone move before in my life. If his swaying is any indication, I think he just got a head rush. Good.</p><p>\u201cBrandon,\u201d Westford calls out as he walks by. \u201cI told you not to bother Carlos. Why aren\u2019t you in your room reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t bothering Carlos,\u201d he says innocently. \u201cHe said he\u2019d play G.I. Joe with me. Right, Carlos?\u201d He looks up at me, his light green eyes practically begging.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say to Westford. \u201cFive minutes of G.I. Joe, then I\u2019m done playing big brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes,\u201d Brandon shoots back.</p><p>\u201cThree,\u201d I shoot right back. Two can play this game, kid.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. Five\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>In his room, he pushes a doll in my hands. \u201cHere!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKid, I hate to break the news to you, but I don\u2019t usually play with dolls.\u201d</p><p>He looks offended as he huffs loudly. \u201cG.I. Joe isn\u2019t a doll. He\u2019s a marine, like my daddy was.\u201d Brandon pulls out miniature plastic soldiers from a bucket and places them around the room. You\u2019d think the kid was making a random mess, but I\u2019ve got a feeling there\u2019s a method to his madness. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have a G.I. Joe when you were a kid?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I don\u2019t remember having many toys . . . we pretty much played with sticks, rocks, and soccer balls. And the odd times Alex would sneak into my mother\u2019s dresser, we\u2019d make up the craziest games with rocks inside her panty hose. A few times we cut the legs off and made slingshots. Other times we filled them with water balloons and whacked each other. Alex and I did get our butts bruised by mi'am\u00e1 a bunch of times for those incidents, but it didn\u2019t matter. The punishments were worth it.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the kid says, getting serious. \u201cThe Cobras are the bad guys who want to take over the world. The G.I. Joes need to capture them. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Let\u2019s get on with it already.\u201d</p><p>Brandon holds his hands up. \u201cWait, wait, wait. You can\u2019t be a G.I. Joe unless you have a code name. What\u2019d you want your code name to be? Mine is Racer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be Guerrero.\u201d</p><p>He tilts his head to the side. \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarrior.\u201d</p><p>He nods his approval. \u201cOkay, Guerrero, our mission is to get Dr. Winky.\u201d Brandon faces me with big, round eyes. \u201cDr. Winky is the biggest, baddest, toughest bad guy on earth. Badder than Cobra Commander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we change the name to something scarier? Sorry, but Dr.Winky doesn\u2019t sound tough at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you can\u2019t change the name. No way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the name. Dr. Winky winks all the time.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but be amused by this kid. \u201cFine. So what did Dr. W. do that\u2019s so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Winky,\u201d Brandon corrects me. \u201cNot. Dr. W.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d I hold up G.I. Joe and say to the plastic dude, \u201cJoe, you ready to kick Dr. W.\u2019s butt?\u201d I turn to Brandon. \u201cJoe says he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Brandon perks up as if he\u2019s on a secret mission. \u201cFollow me,\u201d he says, crawling across the room. \u201cCome on!\u201d he whispers loudly when he notices I haven\u2019t followed.</p><p>I crawl behind him, pretending I\u2019m a six-year-old kid who has the patience to play this game.</p><p>Brandon cups his hand over my ear and whispers, \u201cI think Dr. Winky is hiding in the closet. Call in the troops.\u201d</p><p>I look at the plastic miniature soldiers scattered all over the room, then say, \u201cTroops, surround the closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be a G.I. Joe in your own voice. You have to sound like a marine,\u201d Brandon says, obviously not impressed with my action hero role-playing skills.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it, or I\u2019m outta here,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Don\u2019t leave. You can be G.I. Joe in your own voice.\u201d</p><p>Brandon and I set the miniature soldiers around the closet door. As long as I let myself get sucked into playing, I figure I might as well spice it up a bit. \u201cJoe here told me he got some info on Dr. Winky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Brandon asks, totally getting into it.</p><p>But now I\u2019ve got to think of something fast. \u201cDr. Winky\u2019s got a new weapon. If he winks at you, you\u2019re dead. So make sure not to look directly at his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Brandon says excitedly, reminding me of my little brother, Luis, who gets excited about the smallest things.</p><p>Thinking of Luis makes me think of Mam\u00e1 and how I rarely saw her smile these past few years. As much as I rebel, I\u2019d do anything to make her smile again.</p><p>28</p><p>Kiara</p><p>I watch from the doorway as Carlos and my brother play with the toy soldiers. Carlos set up an elaborate scene with Brandon\u2019s T-shirts as tunnels held up with string. One side is tied on his window latch and spans the entire length of Brandon\u2019s room. The opposite end is attached to his closet handle.</p><p>From his relaxed expression, I\u2019d bet Carlos was having almost as much fun as my brother.</p><p>My mom rubs my shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she mouths.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI worry about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I think back to this afternoon, playing in the yard with Brandon and Carlos. I admit I had fun, too. I give her a huge hug. \u201cMore than fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey seem to be having fun,\u201d she says, nodding to the war scene going on in Brandon\u2019s room. \u201cYou think Carlos is warming up to the idea of living here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes was up a long time ago,\u201d I hear Carlos say.</p><p>My mom rushes into the room and picks up Brandon, heading off what\u2019s sure to be an attempt at a typical Brandon negotiation tactic. \u201cTime for bed, Bran. You\u2019ve got school tomorrow.\u201d After she tucks him in, she asks, \u201cYou did brush your teeth, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d my brother says, nodding. I notice he\u2019s got his mouth totally closed when he nods. I\u2019m guessing my brother isn\u2019t telling the exact truth.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Night, Racer,\u201d Carlos says as he follows my mom out of the room.</p><p>\u201c \u2019Night, Guerrero. Kiara, since Carlos won\u2019t tell me a story, can you sing me a song? Or play the letter game? Please,\u201d Brandon begs me.</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe letter game.\u201d My brother sits with his back to me and lifts up the back of his shirt.</p><p>I\u2019ve been playing this game with him since he was three. With my finger, I trace a letter on his back. He has to guess which letter I\u2019m tracing.</p><p>\u201cA,\u201d he says proudly.</p><p>I trace another one.</p><p>\u201cH!\u201d</p><p>And another.</p><p>\u201cD . . . no, B! Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I tell him, then say, \u201cOkay, one more. Then bedtime.\u201d I trace another letter.</p><p>\u201cZ!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I kiss him on the forehead and tuck him in one last time. \u201cLove you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cLove you, too. Kiara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Carlos I love him, too. I forgot to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Now go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>In the hallway, Carlos is leaning against the wall. My mom has disappeared, probably to watch television in the family room with my dad.</p><p>\u201cI heard what he said, so you don\u2019t need to tell me,\u201d Carlos says. His usual cockiness is gone. He looks vulnerable, as if hearing Brandon say I love you broke down some emotional barrier he\u2019s been holding up. He\u2019s showing a glimpse of the real Carlos.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I look at my shoes because, honestly, I can\u2019t look into his eyes. They\u2019re mesmerizing and too intense right now. \u201cThanks again for, you know, playing with my brother. He really likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause he doesn\u2019t really know me.\u201d</p><p>29</p><p>Carlos</p><p>Before school starts, I go behind the football bleachers to find Nick. Sure enough, he\u2019s smokin\u2019 a joint.</p><p>A look of panic crosses his face, until a second later he masks it with a smile. \u201cHey, man, wassup? I heard you got busted last week. That sucks.\u201d He holds out his joint. \u201cWant a hit?\u201d</p><p>I grab him by the collar and push him into a metal bar. \u201cWhy did you set me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy! I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would I set you up?\u201d</p><p>I punch him in the face and he goes down. \u201cRemember now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d Nick cries out as I stand over him. I\u2019ll kick the crap out of him until he gives me info. If he\u2019s involved in any way with the Guerreros del barrio and Wes Devlin, that means Kiara and the Westfords could be in danger because I\u2019m living with them. I can\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>I grab the front of his shirt and hold him up. \u201cTell me why you put the drugs in my locker. And you better do it quick, because I haven\u2019t been in a good mood since those cops put me in handcuffs.\u201d</p><p>He holds his hands up in surrender. \u201cI\u2019m a pawn, Carlos, just like you. My supplier, this guy Devlin, told me to plant the drugs. I don\u2019t know why. He had a gun. And gave me the can and said to put it in your backpack or else. I don\u2019t know why. I swear it wasn\u2019t my idea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That leaves me to find out whose idea it was. The problem is, now I have to contact Devlin and watch my back every second of the day.</p><p>\u201cCarlos, it\u2019s your turn to share.\u201d</p><p>All eyes are on me after school at REACH. Berger expects me to spill my guts in front of everybody. Isn\u2019t it bad enough I have to hear about their stupid problems, like how Justin\u2019s dad tells him he\u2019s an idiot all the time and how Keno is a hero because his friends all drank beer over the weekend and he didn\u2019t give in to the peer pressure?</p><p>What. A. Bunch. Of. Crap!</p> <p>Mrs. Berger looks at me over the top of her glasses. \u201cCarlos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to share something you did over the past week that had an impact on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Zana sneers, curling her lip-glossed lips. \u201cCarlos thinks he\u2019s too cool to share with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Carmela chimes in. \u201cWhy do you think you\u2019re better than us, huh?\u201d</p><p>Keno gives me a hard stare, obviously tryin\u2019 to intimidate me. I wonder if he knows anything about Devlin.</p><p>It\u2019s clear I shouldn\u2019t expect Mexican Power on my side right now, so I look to Justin.</p><p>\u201cYou can do what you want,\u201d Justin, the green-haired kid says. \u201cJust as long as it doesn\u2019t involve me.\u201d</p><p>What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p><p>Quinn is looking at the floor.</p> <p>Berger leans forward. \u201cCarlos, you\u2019ve been here a week already and haven\u2019t opened up. Each of the other group members has shared a part of themselves with you. Why not share just a tiny bit of what\u2019s been happening so your peers can feel connected to you in some way.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s actually assumin\u2019 I want to be connected to these people. Is she nuts?</p><p>\u201cJust say something already,\u201d Zana urges.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Keno agrees.</p><p>Berger gives me that we\u2019re-here-for-you pity gaze. \u201cOur group is held together when everyone contributes a part of themselves. Think of your sharing as the glue that makes us a unit where everyone helps each other and nobody is left out.\u201d</p><p>She wants glue, I\u2019ll give her glue. I\u2019m not tellin\u2019 them crap about Nick or Devlin, but something else is on my mind. I hold my hands up in surrender. \u201cFine. I almost kissed this girl, Kiara, on Wednesday. It was on top of this stupid mountain she made me climb.\u201d I shake my head in frustration just thinkin\u2019 about it. The problem is, for the past two days I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinkin\u2019 about what that kiss would have been like.</p><p>Keno leans forward in his chair. \u201cYou like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why did you almost kiss her?\u201d Zana asks.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cTo prove a point.\u201d They\u2019re all quiet and totally focused on me.</p><p>\u201cWhat point would that be?\u201d Berger asks.</p><p>\u201cI kiss better than her boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Justin\u2019s hand flies to his shocked, open mouth. If that\u2019s scandalous to him, I bet I can count how many girls he\u2019s kissed on less than one hand.</p><p>\u201cDid she kiss you back?\u201d Carmela asks.</p><p>Keno raises his eyebrows. \u201cIs she Mexicano?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t kiss. We almost kissed, and it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like her,\u201d Zana says. When I sneer she says, \u201cOh, please. People say \u2018it was no big deal\u2019 when it is a big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter, Zana?\u201d Justin chimes in. \u201cHe didn\u2019t actually kiss her, and she has a boyfriend. Whether he likes her or not, she\u2019s taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to work on yourself, Carlos, before you can have a healthy relationship,\u201d Zana says like she\u2019s some sort of expert.</p><p>Yeah, whatever. I don\u2019t like Kiara. The last thing I want is a healthy relationship . . . and I\u2019m not even convinced that a healthy relationship even exists.</p><p>I lean back and cross my arms. \u201cJust so you know, Mrs. B., I\u2019m done talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Berger gives me a nod of approval. \u201cThanks for sharing, Carlos. We all appreciate your willingness to give us a glimpse into your personal life. Believe it or not, our group is more cohesive now because of you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d give a hand gesture to show what I think of her theory, but it\u2019s probably a violation of the damn rules.</p><p>I suffer through the rest of our group therapy session with the misfits, although I swear they\u2019re all actin\u2019 as if we\u2019re friends now. When I walk out of the building at the end of the day, Alex is in the parking lot waiting for me with Brittany\u2019s car.</p><p>When we\u2019re at a stoplight, I see a couple walking hand in hand in front of us. I never see Tuck and Kiara holdin\u2019 hands, so maybe one of them is a germ freak. \u201cKiara\u2019s got this boyfriend who\u2019s a total pendejo,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cThe two of them are ridiculous together.\u201d</p><p>Alex starts shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get messed up with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said to Paco when he warned me about Brittany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get this straight once and for all. I\u2019m not you. I\u2019ll never be you. And if I tell you there\u2019s nothin\u2019 between Kiara and me, I mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe annoys the shit out of me most of the time, anyway.\u201d</p><p>My brother\u2019s response is another laugh.</p><p>When we get to the Westfords\u2019 house, nobody is home. Kiara\u2019s car is in the driveway with the passenger window open as usual.</p><p>\u201cShe needs it fixed,\u201d I tell Alex as we head toward it. I don\u2019t think either one of us can resist imagining what the car would be like if it were fixed up. \u201cThe passenger door doesn\u2019t open.\u201d</p><p>Alex pulls the handle, testing it. \u201cYou should take it apart and see if you can fix it.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFixed up or not, it\u2019s a sweet ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I drove it.\u201d I poke my head inside the window and slide in.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I told you I bought one just like it?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>\u201cReally? You finally have your own car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It needs work, so I\u2019m keepin\u2019 it in the shop until I can rebuild the engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 of engines, I think this one is draggin\u2019,\u201d I tell him, then pop the hood on Kiara\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cYou sure it\u2019s okay we\u2019re doin\u2019 this?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t care,\u201d I tell him, then hope it\u2019s true.</p><p>As we\u2019re inspecting the engine and talking cars, it\u2019s as good a time as any to tell my brother what I found out. \u201cI think Devlin was behind me bein\u2019 set up.\u201d</p><p>Alex picks up his head so fast he bangs it on the hood. \u201cDevlin? Wes Devlin?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWhy Devlin?\u201d He wipes his hand over his eyes, as if he can\u2019t imagine how I got myself into this mess. \u201cHe recruits gang members from all over, turnin\u2019 them into hybrids no matter what their affiliation is. How the hell did you let this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t actually let it happen. It just happened.\u201d</p><p>My brother looks me straight in the eye. \u201cHave you been lyin\u2019 to me, Carlos? Have you been contactin\u2019 the Guerreros back in Mexico and had this drug thing planned all along? Because Devlin doesn\u2019t fuck around. Hell, he even had connections with the Latino Blood back in Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know that?\u201d I pull out Devlin\u2019s number that I found in Nick\u2019s locker and hand it to Alex. \u201cI\u2019m gonna call him.\u201d</p><p>He takes one look at the number and shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to. I\u2019ve got to find out what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Alex gives a short laugh. \u201cHe wants to own you, Carlos. The Guerreros obviously told him about you.\u201d</p><p>I look my brother straight in the eye. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>My brother jumped out of the Latino Blood and almost got killed. He knows what it means to challenge the top when it comes to gangs. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare do anythin\u2019 without me. We\u2019re brothers, Carlos. I\u2019ll always fight with you side by side, no questions asked.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.</p><p>30</p><p>Kiara</p><p>After school Tuck and I decided to take a jog before Tuck\u2019s Ultimate Frisbee practice. We talked the first half mile, but have been running in silence ever since. Our feet slapping on the pavement is the only sound. The heat of the day is gone, but today a chill lingers in the air.</p><p>I like jogging with Tuck. It\u2019s a lonely sport, but having someone to do it with makes it way more fun.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s The Mexican?\u201d Tuck asks, his voice echoing off the mountain slope.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him that,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s racist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiara, how is calling him Mexican racist? He is Mexican.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way you said it, not what you said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you sound like your dad, all sensitive and PC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being sensitive?\u201d I ask him. \u201cWhat if Carlos called you The Gay Guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t accuse him of being racist, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Tuck says.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>Tuck chuckles. \u201cSo did he really call me The Gay Guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He thinks we\u2019re a couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet he doesn\u2019t even know any homos. That guy\u2019s got a testosterone shield a mile high.\u201d</p><p>When we reach the entrance of the jogging path through Canyon Park, I stop. \u201cYou never answered the question,\u201d I say, out of breath. I\u2019m used to the run, but today my heart is racing faster than usual and I\u2019m suddenly anxious for no reason.</p><p>Tuck holds his hands up. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if he called me gay, because I am gay. He\u2019s Mexican, so what\u2019s the big deal if I call him Mexican?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It\u2019s calling him The Mexican that\u2019s annoying.\u201d</p><p>Tuck narrows his eyes at me. His face gets scrunched up, as if he\u2019s trying to figure out what my motivations are. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like The Mexican. I should have seen it all along. That\u2019s why you started stuttering again . . . it\u2019s all because of him!\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes and sneer. \u201cI do not like him.\u201d I start running down the path, ignoring Tuck\u2019s theory.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you like him,\u201d Tuck croons, poking me in the side with his index finger.</p><p>I jog faster.</p><p>\u201cSlow down.\u201d I hear Tuck panting behind me. \u201cOkay, okay. I won\u2019t call him The Mexican. Or say that you like him.\u201d</p><p>I slow down and wait for him to catch up. \u201cHe thinks you and I are dating, and that\u2019s just fine with me. Don\u2019t let him know anything different, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>At the top of the mountain, we stop and admire the city of Boulder below, then jog back home.</p><p>Alex and Carlos are standing next to my car in my driveway.</p><p>Carlos takes one look at us and throws his head back. \u201cYou guys are wearin\u2019 matchin\u2019 outfits. I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d He points to us. \u201cYou see, Alex. Along with everything else, I have to deal with this: matchin\u2019 white people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not matching,\u201d Tuck says defensively.

We\u2019re both wearing black T-shirts with big white letters that read DON\u2019T BE A WIENER, CLIMB A 14\u2019ER! We each bought one after we hiked to the peak of Mount Princeton last year.

Right.\u201d He almost looks embarrassed as he clears his throat and shoves his hands in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cMy mom said to take you grocery shopping. Let me just go get my purse and keys and then if you want we could go.\u201d</p><p>As I head to my room I wonder if I shouldn\u2019t have left Carlos and Tuck together. The two of them don\u2019t mix well at all. I grab my purse off my bed and am ready to run back outside, but Carlos is standing in my doorway.</p> <p>He rubs a hand over his head and sighs.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d I ask, taking a step closer to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but can we just go alone? You and me, without Tuck.\u201d He shifts from one foot to the other as if he\u2019s anxious.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t move. He looks as if he wants to say something more, so I stay where I am. The more we stand here staring at each other, the more nervous I get. It\u2019s not that Carlos intimidates me; when he\u2019s around, the air just seems more electrified. Seeing him vulnerable like this is another glimpse into the real Carlos, the one without the protective wall.</p><p>I held back so much when he threatened to kiss me at The Dome on Wednesday, and now even though Tuck and Alex are outside, I\u2019m feeling an intense attraction to Carlos I\u2019ve never experienced before.</p> <p>\u201cYou gonna change?\u201d he asks, looking at my DON\u2019T BE A WIENER, CLIMB A 14\u2019ER! shirt with sweat spots on it from my jog. \u201cThat shirt has got to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too focused on looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than not bein\u2019 focused on it at all.\u201d</p><p>I slide my purse on my shoulder, then motion for him to move out of the way.</p><p>He moves aside. \u201cSpeakin\u2019 of looks, you ever takin\u2019 that rubber-band thing out of your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Cause it looks like a dog\u2019s tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d As I pass him, I whip my head and try to hit him with my ponytail. He catches it just as it\u2019s about to lash across his face. Instead of pulling it, he lets my hair slide through his fingers. I look back at him and find him smiling. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour hair is soft. I wasn\u2019t expectin\u2019 that.\u201d</p><p>The fact that he actually paid attention to what my hair felt like as it fell from his fingers makes me catch my breath. I swallow hard as he reaches out and runs my hair through his fingers again. It feels intimate.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cOne of these days, Kiara, we\u2019re gonna get in trouble. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I want to ask him to elaborate on what he means by trouble, but I don\u2019t. Instead, I say, \u201cI don\u2019t do trouble,\u201d and walk away from him.</p><p>Outside, Tuck and Alex are waiting for us.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you guys doing in there for so long?\u201d Tuck asks.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to know,\u201d Carlos fires back, then looks at me. \u201cTell him he\u2019s not comin\u2019 with us.\u201d</p><p>Tuck drapes his arm around my shoulders. \u201cWhat is he talking about, babycakes? I thought we were going to hang out at my house and, well, you know.\u201d He wiggles his eyebrows up and down, then pats me on the butt.</p><p>My best friend does such an over-the-top impression of a boyfriend I don\u2019t think he\u2019s convincing at all, but Carlos seems to be buying it, if the look of disgust on his face is any indication.</p><p>I lean close to Tuck\u2019s ear. \u201cTone it down, babycakes.\u201d</p><p>He leans close to my ear. \u201cOkay, snookie-wookie.\u201d</p><p>I push him away before I laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out of here,\u201d Tuck says, then jogs off.</p><p>Alex leaves right after him, so it\u2019s just me and Carlos standing on the driveway.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it took me so long to figure it out,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cYou and Tuck are just friends. I don\u2019t even think you\u2019re friends with benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d I get in my car and avoid eye contact with him.</p><p>Carlos slides through the window. \u201cIf he\u2019s the champion kisser you claim he is, how come I\u2019ve never seen you guys lock lips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe kiss all the time.\u201d I clear my throat, then add, \u201cWe just . . . do it in private.\u201d</p><p>A smug expression crosses his face. \u201cI don\u2019t buy it for a second, \u2019cause if you were my girlfriend and a stud like me was livin\u2019 in your house, I\u2019d kiss you in front of the guy every chance I got as a reminder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reminder of w-w-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were mine.\u201d</p><p>31</p><p>Carlos</p><p>I push a cart through the grocery store, thankful for a chance to shop for food I can actually identify. As I weave around the other customers in the vegetable aisle, I pick up an avocado and toss it to Kiara. \u201cI bet you\u2019ve never had real Mexican food before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I have,\u201d she says as she catches it and places it in the cart. \u201cMy mom makes tacos all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of meat is inside?\u201d I ask, testing her. I bet Mrs. W. doesn\u2019t know the first thing about authentic tacos.</p><p>Kiara mumbles something I can\u2019t make out.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Can\u2019t hear ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTofu. I admit tofu tacos probably isn\u2019t the most authentic Mexican dish, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTofu tacos are not Mexican. I think putting tofu on anything and calling it Mexican is an insult to my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>She walks down the aisle, watching as I pick up tomatoes, onions, cilantro, lime, poblano, and jalape\u00f1os. The fresh smell of each item reminds me of mi'ama\u2019s kitchen. I grab something we always had in our kitchen back home. \u201cThis is a tomatillo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make a mean salsa verde with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like red salsa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only because you haven\u2019t tasted mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d she says, unconvinced. I might have to make a special extra-spicy batch for her so she\u2019ll remember not to challenge me.</p><p>Kiara follows me around the grocery store. I buy all the necessities\u2014 beans, rice, and masa flour, and different kinds of meat (which Kiara insisted on being organic even though it cost almost double what the non-organic meat was). Then we head back.</p><p>In the Westfords\u2019 kitchen, I pull out the groceries and volunteer to make dinner. Mrs. W. is grateful because Brandon has a project for school. Supposedly he tried to make a map on his body with permanent markers, and it\u2019s not coming off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Kiara says as I set out bowls on the counter and place pans on the stove.</p><p>For once I think it\u2019s a good thing Kiara is wearing a T-shirt so I don\u2019t have to make her pull up any sleeves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna get messy,\u201d I tell her after we wash our hands.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I place the masa flour in a bowl, then add water.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She nods.</p><p>I dig in with my hands and knead the masa into the water. \u201cCome on, help me.\u201d</p><p>Kiara stands next to me and dives in, squishing the now wet and sticky dough between her fingers. Our hands touch a few times, and I think one time I accidentally mistook her finger for dough.</p><p>I add more water and stand back, watching her.</p><p>\u201cWhat consistency do you want?\u201d she asks as her hands are busy working in the dough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when to stop.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m standing like an idiot leaning against the counter watching her. Maybe it\u2019s because this girl doesn\u2019t complain about doing anything. She\u2019s not afraid to climb mountains, fix cars, challenge jerks like me, or get her hands dirty in the kitchen. Is there anything this girl can\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t\u2014 do?</p><p>I look into the bowl. The masa mixture definitely looks like a solid mass of dough. \u201cI think that\u2019s good. Now roll it into balls and I\u2019ll mash them with this pan. Since I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t own a tortilla maker, we\u2019ll figure somethin\u2019 out. Be careful, you wouldn\u2019t want to mess up that ridiculous shirt you\u2019re wearin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>While I\u2019m searching the cabinets to find plastic wrap to put in between the pan and ball before I smash it into a tortilla shape, I feel something hit my back. I look on the floor. One of the dough balls is rolling away from me.</p><p>I look at Kiara. In her hand is another ball, aimed right at me.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t just throw that at me, did you?\u201d I ask, amusement laced in my voice.</p><p>She takes another dough ball in her other hand. \u201cI did. It\u2019s punishment for calling my shirt ridiculous.\u201d She smiles in triumph, then whips the ball at me, but this time I catch it. In one movement I pick up the one on the floor so now I\u2019m holding two balls.</p><p>\u201cPunishment, huh?\u201d I say as I toss the one I caught up in the air and catch it again. \u201cAnd it\u2019s got your name written all over it. Payback\u2019s a bitch, chica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to catch me first.\u201d Like a little kid, she sticks her tongue out at me, then makes a dash for the backyard. I let her get a head start while I grab the entire bowl of dough and go after her. My arsenal just multiplied drastically. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin my balls!\u201d She laughs as the words leave her mouth. I watch in amusement as she scrambles to take a side table off the patio and use it as a shield.</p><p>\u201cBetter yours than mine, chica.\u201d I toss the dough balls at her, one by one, until I\u2019ve got none left.</p><p>Our dough war continues until the entire backyard is scattered with little balls.</p><p>Westford comes outside with a confused look on his face. \u201cI thought you two were making dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were,\u201d Kiara tells him.</p><p>\u201cWhile you two have been playing around, the rest of us are hungry. Where\u2019s dinner?\u201d</p><p>Kiara and I look at her dad, then each other. Without even saying a word, we pelt him with dough balls until he joins the war. In the end, Mrs. W. and Brandon get in on the dough wars, too.</p><p>I\u2019m tempted to call Alex and Brittany over, \u2019cause I wouldn\u2019t mind pelting them with a few. Maybe I should suggest to Mrs. Berger to have dough wars during REACH. It beats group therapy any day of the week.</p><p>32</p><p>Kiara</p><p>\u201cCome over tonight,\u201d Madison says to Carlos at his locker Friday morning. \u201cMy parents are still gone, so we can play house all weekend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m standing at my locker and hear her. Carlos is supposed to go with me to The Highlands to help with the painting class tonight. Will he blow me off for her?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Carlos tells her.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got plans.\u201d</p> <p>She steps back, shocked. I don\u2019t think anyone has ever rejected her before. \u201cWith a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she says, her word as sharp as a knife.</p><p>Before I know what\u2019s happening, Carlos pulls me to his side. \u201cWith Kiara.\u201d</p><p>While I\u2019m still in shock, Madison sneers at both of us. \u201cThat\u2019s a joke, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually\u2014,\u201d I start, ready to out him, but Carlos squeezes me closer and almost cuts off the circulation in my arm.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been secretly datin\u2019 since last week.\u201d He gives me a smile and a look that says I\u2019m his one-and-only. That smile might deceive Madison, but I know he\u2019s full of it. \u201cIsn\u2019t that right, K.?\u201d</p><p>He squeezes me tighter. \u201cUh-huh,\u201d I squeak out.</p><p>Madison shakes her head fast, as if she can\u2019t believe what she\u2019s hearing. \u201cNobody in their right mind chooses Kiara Westford over me.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right. We\u2019re busted.</p><p>\u201cWanna bet?\u201d My eyes go wide when Carlos bends his head down to me. \u201cKiss me, cari\u00f1o.\u201d</p> <p>Kiss? In the hallway in front of everyone? I can\u2019t even talk in front of Madison, let alone kiss the guy she\u2019s interested in, in front of her. \u201cI-I-I d-d-don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>I try to come up with something, but keep stuttering. As if Carlos doesn\u2019t even notice I\u2019m struggling with my speech, his fingers cup my cheek, then trace a gentle path down to my lips. It\u2019s something a boyfriend would do to a girlfriend that he\u2019s crazy about and . . . and . . . and Carlos is full of complete bullshit. I know it. He knows it. But Madison doesn\u2019t know it.</p><p>I can feel his hot breath on my face, and hear an almost silent word of thanks before he tilts his head and puts his lips on mine. I close my eyes and try to shut out the rest of the school and just focus on trying to savor the moment. Even if the kiss is fake, it doesn\u2019t feel fake. It feels exciting and sweet. I know I should push him away, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>I reach up and wrap my arms around his neck. At the same time, he pulls me closer and without warning teases my mouth open with little erotic licks of his tongue. I don\u2019t know where he learned to kiss like this, but it\u2019s hard not to moan into his mouth and feel something deep in my body awaken when our tongues touch.</p><p>When Carlos pulls back and unwraps my arms from his neck, he sighs. \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-w-what was th-th-that all about?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks around to make sure people aren\u2019t eavesdropping. \u201cI need you to be my girlfriend. There, I said it.\u201d When I don\u2019t respond, he takes my elbow and pulls me down the hall until we get to the computer lab. It\u2019s empty, except for the thirty computers in neat little rows.</p><p>The guy is confusing me, and it doesn\u2019t help that my lips are still tingling from his erotic kiss. I compose myself and think about the words before I say them. I\u2019m not going to stutter. \u201cWhat about Madison? You had sex with her in her parents\u2019 bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with her, Kiara. That\u2019s a rumor she started, not me. I knew her for a whole five days before I went to her stupid party. Give me a little credit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? You\u2019re always t-t-talking trash.\u201d I turn my back to him and start walking out of the computer lab. I guess I\u2019m getting mad because it looked and felt like a real kiss, when in reality Carlos kissed me as a ploy to dupe Madison.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I admit it. I talk trash. But I didn\u2019t have sex with her, and the only reason she\u2019s after me in the first place is because she wants to make Ram jealous. I need her off my back, so will you pretend we\u2019re a couple or what?\u201d He shoves his hands in his pockets. \u201cName your price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re too smart to fall for my bullshit, and I don\u2019t want a real girlfriend. I had one once, and it was a complete disaster. Come on, name your price.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t care about dressing up every day, but just once I\u2019d like to go to a school dance with an actual date. It\u2019s my last year at Flatiron, and I might not get another chance.</p><p>\u201cGo to Homecoming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do dances.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cHomecomin\u2019 is out of the question. And don\u2019t even think about makin\u2019 me go to prom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen forget it.\u201d</p><p>I head for the door, but he grabs my elbow and urges me to face him. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone else here who can help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomecoming or nothing,\u201d I tell him, staying firm.</p><p>Carlos gnashes his teeth. \u201cFine. Homecoming. But you have to wear a dress . . . and heels. And I\u2019m not talkin\u2019 those thick granny ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t own heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen go buy some.\u201d He holds out his hand. \u201cDeal?\u201d</p><p>I take a second to think about it, then put my hand in his and give it a hard shake. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>I try to hide my excitement, but I can\u2019t just shake on it. I open my arms wide and hug him tight. I think he\u2019s surprised, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to Homecoming! And not just with any boy . . . with Carlos, a boy who might just be the most perfect fake boyfriend. Now if I could only cut out the fake part . . .</p><p>I pick up Carlos at the REACH facility at five and drive him over to The Highlands. The entire group is waiting for us at their easels, eager to start drawing.</p><p>I take Carlos to Betty Friedman, one of the administrators who schedules the classes. \u201cBetty, this is Carlos,\u201d I say, introducing them. \u201cHe\u2019s helping me today.\u201d</p><p>Betty looks up from her desk. \u201cThanks, Carlos. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Everyone has been excited to have live models. One of our resident artists is here to supervise and help you out today.\u201d We follow her to the front of the recreation area, where a guy wearing a black turtleneck and matching tight black pants is setting out different color paints in jars.</p><p>\u201cHere are your models,\u201d Betty tells him. \u201cKiara and Carlos, this is Antoine Soleil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought costumes,\u201d I tell Antoine as I pull out a red checkered shirt and cowboy belt for Carlos and a cowgirl outfit for me. I borrowed them from the theater department at school.</p><p>Carlos takes one look at the costume and takes two steps back. \u201cYou never said anythin\u2019 about costumes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWe\u2019re wearing costumes.\u201d</p><p>Betty points to a room off to the side. \u201cYou can dress in the conference room, if you want. Or wait until one of the guest bathrooms becomes available, although I just saw Mrs. Heller walk in and it might be some time until she resurfaces.\u201d</p><p>Carlos grabs the shirt and belt from me, then walks into the conference room. I follow behind with the cowgirl outfit.</p><p>\u201cRemind me why I agreed to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you wanted to do something nice for me,\u201d I tell him as I lock us in the room so nobody accidentally walks in.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He pulls his shirt over his head, revealing a rock-hard stomach any guy would envy and any girl would drool over. \u201cNext time I want to do somethin\u2019 nice, slap me.\u201d He looks at me and the side of his mouth quirks up. \u201cI was kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d I pull the denim and lace cowgirl dress over my head, glad to have the table hiding me at least a little. When it\u2019s in place, I weave my hands through my own shirt and toss it aside, then shimmy out of my pants. Whoa. This dress is short. Really, really short. I look at my bare legs. I try pulling the dress down, but the lace is so layered and frilly it stands out like petals.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me I have to actually wear this ridiculous belt,\u201d Carlos says from across the room as he secures the oversized silver buckle on the belt.</p><p>\u201cPretend you\u2019re a rodeo champion,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cMore like a champion wrestler by the size of this thing. What are you wearin\u2019? You better look as ridiculous as I do.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my short, frilly dress with the fake jean vest sewn into the front. \u201cMine is worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome out from behind the table and show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. We\u2019re a couple now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a fake couple, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>He sits on the edge of the conference table. \u201cWell, I was thinkin\u2019 . . . I figure as long as we know it\u2019s not goin\u2019 anywhere, we could, you know, hang out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does \u2018hang out\u2019 mean?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou know, spend more time with each other. You make me laugh, Kiara, and right now I need some fun in my life.\u201d He moves around to my side of the table and looks at my outfit, then whistles appreciatively. \u201cNice legs. You should show \u2019em more often.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, showin\u2019 your legs more often or hangin\u2019 out with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d While the very idea of being with Carlos is exciting, I need to protect my heart from being broken. Hanging out to Carlos means keeping an emotional wall up so we don\u2019t get too involved. I don\u2019t know if my wall is that strong.</p><p>In the rec room, I introduce Carlos to Sylvia, Mildred, Mr. Whittaker, and the others. Sylvia grabs my sleeve. \u201cHe\u2019s a looker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. The problem is, he knows it, too.\u201d</p><p>Mildred waves Carlos over. \u201cLet me look at you.\u201d She eyes him up and down. \u201cI saw you when you walked in. What\u2019s with all those tattoos? Makes you look like a hooligan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect I am a hooligan,\u201d he says to her. \u201cWhatever that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that you\u2019re trouble,\u201d Mildred says, pointing her paintbrush at him. \u201cNothing but trouble. My husband was a hooligan. Trouble followed him wherever he went. He used to ride around on his motorcycle like he was James Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d Carlos asks her.</p><p>\u201cThe old coot died ten years ago in a car accident.\u201d She pats Carlos\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou look a little like him. Come closer.\u201d When he does, she closes her eyes and reaches out to touch his face, almost tracing it with her fingers. Carlos is still, letting her fantasize about going back to a happier time and pretend for the moment that she\u2019s touching her husband\u2019s face instead of Carlos\u2019s. Mildred sighs, then opens her eyes. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispers, tears welling in her eyes.</p><p>Carlos nods in silent understanding at the gift he just gave her. I\u2019m standing here in awe of him. On the outside, Carlos is a tough jerk who doesn\u2019t let anyone get close to him. But when I get little glimpses of his hidden warmth and compassion, I feel that inner wall of mine start to crumble.</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s get this class started,\u201d Antoine says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Antoine has set up a little stage in the front of the room. \u201cYou two,\u201d he says, pointing to us. \u201cStand here and pose.\u201d</p><p>Carlos gets on the stage first, then grabs my hand and helps me up. \u201cNow what?\u201d Carlos asks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to pose,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>Antoine pounds his hand on the stage, getting our attention. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how. Kiara, grab his shoulders. Carlos, hold her around her waist.\u201d</p><p>We do as he instructs. \u201cLike this?\u201d I ask, trying to ignore what Carlos\u2019s hands feel like holding me.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re afraid to get close to each other,\u201d Antoine says. \u201cYou\u2019re too stiff. Kiara, lean toward Carlos with your upper body. Yes, that\u2019s it. Now bend one knee . . . Carlos, make sure you support her weight or else she\u2019ll fall . . . Kiara, look up at him as if you\u2019re in love, waiting for that promise of a kiss . . . and Carlos, you look down at her as if Kiara is the cowgirl you\u2019ve been waiting for your entire life. Perfect!\u201d he says. \u201cNow don\u2019t move for the next half hour.\u201d He turns to the residents of The Highlands and talks about silhouettes and the human form . . . but all I can do is get lost in Carlos\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou were great with the residents,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI appreciate you being here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I appreciate you wearin\u2019 that dress.\u201d</p> <p>For the next half hour as we\u2019re trying not to move, I\u2019m gazing into Carlos\u2019s deep dark eyes and he\u2019s looking into mine. Even though my body is starting to feel stiff, I feel safe and happy. There\u2019s nothing else I can do except to say, \u201cI\u2019ve made a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs. I\u2019d like us to hang out more.\u201d</p><p>He cocks a brow. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we gonna shake on it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy hands are kind of busy at the moment,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He smiles, that cocky smile that\u2019s so a part of him he wouldn\u2019t be Carlos without it. \u201cYour hands might be busy, but your lips aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>33</p><p>Carlos</p><p>Most mornings, I\u2019m awakened by Brandon\u2019s voice singing one of his usual songs, which gets stuck in my head\u2014\u201cGood morning to you, good morning to you. We\u2019re all in our places with bright shining faces. And this is the way, we start a new day!\u201d It could drive anyone insane.</p><p>No, today it\u2019s not Kiara\u2019s little brother who wakes me up. It\u2019s Tuck\u2019s voice bellowing in the hallway. \u201cLa cucaracha, la cucaracha, ya no puede caminar, porque no tiene, porque le falta, I don\u2019t know the rest la la la la!\u201d</p><p>And while Brandon doesn\u2019t mean to annoy me, Tuck\u2019s reason for living might just be to piss me off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever shut up?\u201d I yell, hoping he can hear me out in the hallway.</p> <p>\u201cHey, amigo,\u201d Tuck says, opening the door. \u201cRise and shine!\u201d</p><p>I pick up my head. \u201cDidn\u2019t I lock the door to keep people like you out?\u201d</p><p>He holds up a bent paper clip and wiggles it. \u201cYep. Lucky for me I know how to use the magic door-opener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need your help, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hate me so much because Kiara likes me better than you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for long. Get the fuck out. Now,\u201d I tell him. The guy doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cOkay, seriously, I don\u2019t know if this is true or not, but I heard people who use profanity are trying to compensate for their lack of, you know, size.\u201d</p><p>I whip off the covers and jump out of bed and chase him into the hallway, but he\u2019s gone.</p><p>Kiara\u2019s door is suspiciously open. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . ,\u201d she says.</p><p>I scan her room, then open her closet door. Sure enough, Tuck is standing inside. \u201cI was just kidding. Can\u2019t you take a joke, man?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNot at seven in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cPut some clothes on so you don\u2019t scare poor Kiara with your morning hard-on.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my shorts. Sure enough, I\u2019ve got la tengo dura in front of Kiara and Tuck. Shit. I reach out for the first thing I can grab and put it in front of me to shield myself from view. It happens to be one of Kiara\u2019s stuffed animals, but I don\u2019t have much choice right now.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Kiara\u2019s Mojo,\u201d Tuck says, laughing. \u201cGet it? Mojo?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, I rush back to my room and toss Mojo on the floor. Knowing Kiara, she\u2019ll probably make me buy her a new stuffed animal.</p><p>I sit on my bed, wondering how I\u2019m going to get closer to Kiara with Tuck in the picture, and wondering why I even want to. I like kissin\u2019 her, that\u2019s all. A knock at my door interrupts my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I say, the words coming out as a growl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Kiara.\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . and Tuck,\u201d comes another voice.</p><p>I open the door. \u201cHe wants to apologize,\u201d Kiara says.</p><p>\u201cI am very sorry I opened your door without permission,\u201d Tuck says as if he\u2019s a little kid sent to apologize by his mother. \u201cI promise not to do it ever again. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I start to close the door, but Kiara puts her palm on it.</p><p>\u201cWait. Tuck really does need your help, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Ultimate team only has six players and we need seven. We have three people out with the flu, and two more got hurt in the quarterfinals and can\u2019t play. Kiara thinks you\u2019d be halfway decent.\u201d</p><p>Halfway decent? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you play?\u201d I ask Kiara. \u201cYou\u2019re athletic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a coed team,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-male team.\u201d</p><p>Tuck holds his palms together in a praying position, and I can just sense the bullshit about to fly. \u201cPlease, amigo. We need you, Kimosabe, O Mighty Powerful One. We need you more than the earth rises in the west.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun rises in the east, dickhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re standing on the earth. If you\u2019re on the moon, the earth rises in the west.\u201d He takes a deep breath. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m done sucking up. You in or out? The game starts in less than a half hour and I need to know if we have to forfeit or not. Unfortunately, you\u2019re probably our only hope.\u201d</p><p>I look at Kiara.</p><p>\u201cTuck really needs your help,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll come watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll do it for you,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cWait, what . . . what is he talking about that he\u2019ll do it for you?\u201d Tuck looks from me to Kiara, but neither of us say a word. \u201cIs anyone going to tell me what\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Give me five minutes,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>On the drive to the game, Kiara insists I call my brother and ask him to come to the game. \u201cJust call him,\u201d she says. \u201cOr I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want him there.\u201d</p><p>She holds out her cell. \u201cMaybe you want him there so bad, but you\u2019re too stubborn to admit it. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>Now why did she have to go and do that?</p><p>I grab the phone out of her hand and call my brother. I tell him about the game, and without hesitation he says he\u2019ll be there.</p><p>After I hang up and toss the cell back to Kiara, Tuck goes over the rules with me. I focus on the important ones: once I catch the Frisbee I have to stop and throw it to another teammate within ten seconds.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a contact sport, Carlos,\u201d Tuck reminds me for the, like, tenth time. \u201cSo if you feel like punching, pushing, or fighting with someone, make sure it\u2019s after the game.\u201d</p><p>On the field, Tuck introduces me to our team. A thought keeps running through my head: if I help Tuck\u2019s team win, will Kiara think I\u2019m a hero?</p><p>I\u2019m practicing with the guys in the minutes before the game. Even though I haven\u2019t thrown a disc in a few years, I have no problem makin\u2019 it sail through the air to my teammate.</p><p>One of the guys on my team runs past me, winks at me, then smacks me on the ass.</p><p>What the hell was that, some sort of Ultimate ritual? I don\u2019t do rituals that involve other guys\u2019 hands on my ass.</p><p>I walk over to Tuck, who\u2019s stretching out on the sidelines. \u201cAm I delusional, or was that guy hitting on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Larry. Don\u2019t ask me why, but he thinks you\u2019re hot. He hasn\u2019t stopped drooling since you got here. Just don\u2019t lead him on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Tuck reaches into his duffel and tosses me a shirt. \u201cIt\u2019s our team uniform.\u201d</p><p>I hold it out in front of me. \u201cIt\u2019s pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got something against pink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s gay.\u201d</p><p>Tuck smacks his lips together. \u201cUm, yeah. Carlos, now\u2019s probably a good time for me to tell you something. You\u2019re probably not gonna like it.\u201d</p><p>As Tuck talks, I take close inventory of my teammates. Dennis, a guy who looks mighty feminine. The guy who hit me on the ass is now biting on his lower lip as if he wants to get with me. And the pink shirts . . . \u201cThis is a team of gay dudes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat gave it away? The pink shirts, or half our team drooling over you?\u201d</p><p>I shove the shirt back in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not doin\u2019 this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Carlos. Playing on a team with gays doesn\u2019t make you gay. Don\u2019t be a homophobe. That\u2019s so un-PC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me if I\u2019ve ever given a shit about bein\u2019 PC?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink of all the fans you\u2019ll disappoint. Kiara . . . and your brother.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know if my brother is laughing or cringing: all I know is that he\u2019s givin\u2019 me a thumbs-up from the bleachers. Brittany has suddenly shown up here, too. Kiara and Brittany have their heads huddled together, deep in conversation.</p><p>I know I shouldn\u2019t ask this, but I can\u2019t help it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of our team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUltimate Queers,\u201d Tuck says, then starts laughing.</p><p>I, on the other hand, am not laughin\u2019.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t like our team name? You\u2019re one of us now, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still not laughin\u2019.</p><p>He catches a practice toss from one of the other guys, then tosses it back. \u201cOh, and just so you know, before we go out on the field we all get in a huddle and yell \u2018Go Queers!\u2019 really loud.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s it. \u201cI\u2019m quittin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I start walking off the field. If anyone back home saw me, my ass would be kicked from Atencingo to Acapulco and back again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just kidding, man,\u201d Tuck calls after me.</p><p>I stop.</p><p>\u201cAnd our name isn\u2019t Ultimate Queers.\u201d He holds his hands up in surrender. \u201cOkay, okay, truth is we don\u2019t yell \u2018Go Queers,\u2019 although Joe over there with the spiked hair suggested it at the beginning of the season. Our team name is The Ultimates. We couldn\u2019t come up with a cool name, so Larry came up with The Ultimates and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been ever since. Happy now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head and grab the shirt back. \u201cYou so owe me for this,\u201d I say as I pull my T-shirt over my head and exchange it for the pink one.</p><p>\u201cI know. Name your price, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Later.\u201d I gaze over at Kiara in the stands. \u201cHas Kiara ever had a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>He taps his chin with his index finger. \u201cDid she tell you about Michael?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s Michael?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe guy Kiara dated over the summer.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s never mentioned the guy. \u201cHow serious was it?\u201d</p><p>Tuck grins wide. \u201cMy, my, aren\u2019t we curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe told her he loved her, then he text-dumped her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Tuck points to the other side of the field where the opposing team is practicing. \u201cHe\u2019s the tall guy picking up his water bottle right over there, with the last name of Barra on his shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat guy with the green bandanna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s the one,\u201d Tuck says. \u201cMichael Barra, the text-dumper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he bald?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Barra protects his precious hair so it doesn\u2019t get messy when he plays.\u201d Tuck puts his hand on my chest to get my attention. \u201cBut remember what I told you in the car on the way over here when I explained the rules. This is a no-contact sport, Carlos. We get penalized for unnecessary roughness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d In the opposite end zone I watch Kiara\u2019s ex as he tosses his water bottle toward the sideline after taking a swig and doesn\u2019t give a damn that it almost hits one of the spectator\u2019s dogs. I hate that guy and I\u2019ve never even met him.</p><p>When the game starts, Dennis throws his arm back and whips the disc across the field to our opponents. The game is going fine until one of the guys on the other team mumbles a fag comment when I intercept his throw. The blood in my veins fires up in the same way it does when I\u2019ve been called a dirty Mexican.</p><p>I\u2019m competitive, tough, and I\u2019m ready to kick some Ultimate ass.</p><p>I wonder if now is a good time to let Tuck know he should expect some very necessary roughness coming from one very fired-up Mexicano.</p><p>34</p><p>Kiara</p><p>It\u2019s weird seeing Michael again. I knew he\u2019d be here, but I didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d feel about seeing him again after our breakup. I thought I\u2019d still feel at least a little spark or remember why I started dating him, but I look over at him and feel absolutely nothing. I have definitely moved on. The problem is that the person I\u2019m falling for hard and fast doesn\u2019t want more than a fling. I don\u2019t want a fling with Carlos. I\u2019ll go along with pretending this thing between us is temporary and casual, but every time we\u2019re together it feels too right to be temporary or casual.</p> <p>I find myself daydreaming about him when I wake up in the morning, in school when something reminds me of him, and when I fall asleep at night. Even when Michael and I were dating, just thinking about him didn\u2019t brighten my day as much as thoughts of Carlos do.</p><p>While he does his best to be a jerk, every day I get glimpses of the true Carlos. When he\u2019s playing with my brother, I see a soft side he doesn\u2019t show the rest of the world. When he\u2019s joking around with me, his playful side comes out. When he kisses me, I sense his desperate need for affection. When he\u2019s cooking Mexican dishes or inserting Spanish into his English, his loyalty to his heritage and culture comes shining out of him like a beam of light.</p><p>I know the great things about Carlos and why I\u2019m feeling attached to him like I\u2019ve never felt with anyone else before. But he hasn\u2019t given me glimpses into his dark side, the side that makes him angry and jealous and beaten down. And I know it\u2019s that part of him that won\u2019t let him get emotionally involved.</p><p>I watch as the teams line up in each of their end zones and Tuck\u2019s team tosses the disc in play. Michael is the first to run out and catch it, then quickly aims for another player on his team. The problem is that Carlos is there to intercept the disc almost the second it leaves Michael\u2019s hands.</p><p>In the first two minutes of the game, The Ultimates have scored. Tuck gives Carlos a high five. I have to admit it\u2019s nice seeing them celebrating instead of arguing.</p><p>\u201cCarlos is really good,\u201d Brittany says to both Alex and me.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Fuentes, of course he\u2019s good,\u201d Alex says proudly.</p><p>I also knew Carlos would be good, because Carlos wouldn\u2019t agree to play if he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be decent at it.</p><p>The next time Carlos has the disc, Michael gets in his face and says something. I have no clue what they\u2019re saying, but both look like they\u2019re ready to fight. In fact, after Carlos tosses the disc to another guy on his team, he gives Michael a shove, and Michael lands hard on his butt.</p><p>\u201cFoul!\u201d someone on Michael\u2019s team yells.</p><p>\u201cFoul, my ass,\u201d Carlos argues. \u201cHe was in my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard him taunt our player,\u201d Tuck calls out, then points to Michael. \u201cThat guy should get a taunting violation.\u201d</p><p>Michael stands and points to Carlos. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in my face since the game started!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re playing one-on-one,\u201d Tuck says. \u201cHe was defending you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe pushed me. You saw it. Everyone saw it. He should be kicked out!\u201d</p><p>If Carlos is kicked out, the game is over because The Ultimates have to forfeit. Carlos looks at me and my heart turns over. He isn\u2019t playing because Tuck asked, he\u2019s doing it for me . . . and I have a sneaking suspicion he was getting aggressive with Michael because of me.</p><p>Thankfully the confrontation ends before it gets out of hand, and they start the game again. I watch for the next hour as both teams battle it out. In the end, The Ultimates win 13\u20139.</p><p>When I climb down off the bleachers, Michael is walking toward me. He still looks the same, just sweatier than usual. With his bandanna now off, his light brown hair is neatly combed to perfection in a side part. I used to be in awe that he never had a hair out of place, but now it\u2019s just irritating me.</p><p>Michael wipes the sweat off his face with a towel. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d come to the game or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTuck was playing,\u201d I say, as if that explains everything. \u201cAnd Carlos.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrow. \u201cWho\u2019s Carlos? That gay guy I almost got in a fight with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Except he\u2019s not gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re involved with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvolved isn\u2019t exactly what I\u2019d call it. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Carlos suddenly appears in front of us. He\u2019s shirtless as he slides between Michael and me, his sweat making wet streaks across Michael\u2019s forearm. Michael looks at his arm in disgust, then swipes Carlos\u2019s sweat off with his towel. As if that didn\u2019t make enough of a scene, Carlos parks himself beside me and drapes his arm across my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re . . . hanging out,\u201d I tell Michael.</p><p>Michael completely ignores the fact that Carlos is standing beside me and asks, \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means she\u2019s got her hands full with a hot Latino every night, dude,\u201d Carlos interrupts, then pulls me closer and bends his head to kiss me.</p><p>Instead of kissing Carlos, I push his arm off me and step away from him. He made it sound like I\u2019m someone he screws around with, like we\u2019re friends with benefits . . . maybe even without the \u201cfriends\u201d part.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe act. Just be normal,\u201d I tell him, trying to save face with Michael while trying to hide my hurt from Carlos.</p><p>\u201cNormal? I\u2019m not normal enough for you?\u201d Carlos says. \u201cYou want this guy instead? Did you notice his hair doesn\u2019t move? That\u2019s not normal. You want to date him again, go ahead. Hell, if you want to marry him and be Kiara Barra the rest of your life, be my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it. Hasta,\u201d Carlos says, ignoring me and walking away.</p><p>I feel my face heat up in embarrassment as I look back at Michael. \u201cSorry. Carlos can be abrasive sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. The guy obviously has major issues and, for the record, my hair moves . . . when I want it to. Listen,\u201d he says, changing the subject. \u201cMy team is going to Old Chicago at Pearl Street Mall for lunch. Come with me, Kiara. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I look back at Tuck, Brittany, and Alex. \u201cI came with other people . . .\u201d</p><p>Michael waves to one of his teammates. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go. If you change your mind about lunch, you know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>I find Brittany and Alex talking to Tuck by my car. Carlos is nowhere in sight.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Brittany asks me.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for being nosy,\u201d Brittany says, \u201cbut I saw Carlos with his arm around you. He looked pretty angry when he stalked off, and we haven\u2019t seen him since. Are you and Carlos\u2014,\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretending to date, but Kiara\u2019s not pretending,\u201d Tuck tells them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go find him,\u201d Alex says, shaking his head in frustration. \u201cI\u2019ll set him straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t,\u201d I say in a panic. \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He can\u2019t just go around pretending to date girls and treat them like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex,\u201d Brittany interrupts, \u201clet Kiara and Carlos figure it out themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s being stu\u2014\u201d He stops midsentence as Brittany squeezes his hand.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Brittany assures him, then smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t interfere just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so logical?\u201d he asks her.</p><p>\u201cBecause my boyfriend is hardheaded and always ready for a fight,\u201d she responds, then turns to me and Tuck. \u201cThose traits run in the Fuentes family tree. It\u2019ll be fine in the end, Kiara,\u201d she assures me.</p><p>I just don\u2019t know if my heart will be shattered into pieces before that happens.</p><p>35</p><p>Carlos</p><p>\u201cCarlos, can you give me a hand with my wife\u2019s car?\u201d Westford asks later in the afternoon.</p><p>I\u2019m drinking one of Mrs. W.\u2019s special cups of tea on the patio. \u201cSure,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you help me change the oil? I also want to make sure the muffler is attached properly. Colleen said it\u2019s been making a rumbling sound.\u201d</p><p>Soon I\u2019m helping the Professor jack up the car and steady it on bricks he has stashed in the garage. We both shimmy under the body while the oil drains into a small bucket.</p><p>\u201cDid you have fun at the game this morning?\u201d the Prof asks.</p><p>\u201cYeah, \u2019cept I didn\u2019t know I was going to be playin\u2019 for a gay team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it matter?\u201d</p><p>At first, yeah. But in the end we were all just a bunch of guys on a team. \u201cNo. Did you know Tuck was gay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe made it clear when he came to live with us a few years back. His parents were in the middle of a messy divorce and he needed a place to stay.\u201d He puts down his flashlight and looks over at me. \u201cKinda like you needed a place to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 of that: you might regret your decision after I tell you that Kiara and I have been hangin\u2019 out a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. Why would that make me regret letting you stay here?\u201d</p><p>I wish we weren\u2019t under a car right now as I\u2019m sayin\u2019 this. \u201cWhat if I told you I kissed her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if he has the urge to tie me under the car and drop it on me so my guts splatter all over his driveway. Or make me drink the dirty car oil until I promise to keep my Mexican paws off his daughter.</p><p>\u201cYou were probably gonna find out sooner or later from someone else,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your honesty, Carlos. That shows integrity, and I\u2019m proud of you. It probably wasn\u2019t easy for you to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you kickin\u2019 me out of your house, or what?\u201d I need to know if I\u2019ll be out on the streets tonight.</p> <p>Westford shakes his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not kicking you out. You\u2019re both old enough to be responsible. I was a teenager once, too, and I\u2019m not naive enough to think kids today are any different than I was. But you better not hurt one hair on her head or force her to do anything she doesn\u2019t want to do, or else I will not only kick you out of the house, I\u2019ll dismember you limb by limb. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now take this flashlight and check the radiator to see if I need to flush it.\u201d</p><p>I take the flashlight from him, but before I get out from under the car I say, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot treatin\u2019 me like a gangbanger.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>After I help Westford with the car, I call Mam\u00e1 and Luis. I tell them about the Ultimate game, and Kiara, and the Westfords, and all the other bullshit. It feels good to talk to mi familia. When I tell them I haven\u2019t ditched school I feel like I have a family cheering section. I haven\u2019t felt that way in a long time. Obviously I leave out the part about Devlin, because there\u2019s no way I\u2019m putting mi'am\u00e1 through the stress of knowing that detail.</p><p>After the call, I walk into the kitchen but there\u2019s no sign of any Westford. \u201cWe\u2019re in the den,\u201d Mrs. W. calls out to me. \u201cCome join us.\u201d</p><p>The entire Westford family is sitting in front of the television in the small room off to the side of the house. The professor and his wife are in separate chairs, and Kiara and Brandon are sharing the couch. Slices of lasagna are set on the coffee table in front of them.</p><p>\u201cTake a plate, some lasagna, and a seat,\u201d Westford instructs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Family Fun Night!\u201d Brandon yells as he jumps up and down on the couch.</p><p>\u201cFamily Fun Night?\u201d I question. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. W. picks up a plate and hands it to me. \u201cIt\u2019s where we pick an activity and do it together, as a family. It\u2019s a once-a-month thing we do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou guys are kiddin\u2019 me, right?\u201d I look around at all of them and realize they\u2019re not joking. They really do have Family Fun Night, and they really do want to hang out together on a Saturday night.</p><p>When I look over at Kiara, I think it wouldn\u2019t be so bad to spend the night just chilling in front of the TV. I pile my plate with food and head for the couch.</p><p>\u201cMove over, cachorro.\u201d</p><p>Brandon scoots between me and Kiara.</p><p>After we finish dinner, I help bring the dirty plates to the kitchen while Kiara makes the popcorn.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do all this family stuff with us if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Kiara tells me.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go out anyway.\u201d I toss a piece of popcorn into the air and catch it in my mouth.</p><p>I walk back in the family room with my mind more on Kiara than anything else. Even when the cartoon movie comes on that Brandon picked, I sneak glances at her.</p><p>\u201cBran, time for bed,\u201d Mrs. W. says after the movie is over.</p><p>\u201cI want to stay up,\u201d he whines, then grabs on to Kiara\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You\u2019ve been going to bed too late,\u201d Mrs. Westford says. \u201cNow give your sister and Carlos a hug and come with me.\u201d</p><p>Brandon stands on the couch and whips himself into Kiara\u2019s arms. She hugs him tight and kisses him on the cheek. \u201cLove you more than you love me,\u201d he tells her.</p><p>\u201cNot possible,\u201d she says back.</p><p>He wiggles out of her arms and hops on the couch over to my side. He opens his arms wide and wraps them around my neck. \u201cLove you, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speakin\u2019 Espa\u00f1ol, cachorro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I learned it in class this week. Amigo is friend.\u201d</p><p>I pat him on the back. \u201cYou are my little Mexicano wannabe, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a wannabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll explain it in the morning. Time for bed, Bran,\u201d Mrs. W. says. \u201cNow. No more wasting time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou kids pick the next movie,\u201d Westford says, tossing us the remote. \u201cI\u2019m going to make more popcorn. Bran, I\u2019ll be up to say good night after you get in pj\u2019s and brush your teeth.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. W. takes Brandon upstairs and the Professor leaves with the empty popcorn bowls. I\u2019m alone with Kiara. At last.</p><p>I sit with one arm over the back of the couch and the other resting on my knee. I\u2019m all too aware of this girl beside me. She gets up and walks over to a cabinet lined with rows of movies\u2014obviously the Westfords\u2019 personal collection. I\u2019ve never been in a house with an entire collection of movies before.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be normal with you,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>She turns to me, confused. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning in front of Michael you asked me to be normal.\u201d I take a deep breath and tell her what I should have said after the game. Instead of lettin\u2019 her ignore me when I finally got home, I should have told her the truth. \u201cI can\u2019t. When Tuck told me you\u2019d dated Michael, all these visions of you with another guy drove me nuts. I don\u2019t want you with another guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be with another guy. I want to be with you. Now pick a movie before I say something you don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d She waves me over. \u201cPick one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want to watch is fine,\u201d I tell her, pushing aside the comment about her not telling me what I don\u2019t want to hear. I\u2019ve heard enough. She wants to be with me. I want to be with her. Why complicate it by sayin\u2019 anything else?</p><p>She pulls out West Side Story and I laugh. \u201cYou like that movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like the dancing. And the singing.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if she can move as well as she fixes cars. Or if she thinks an interracial couple is doomed because they\u2019re too different. \u201cDo you dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. Do you? I mean besides the, um, horizontal tango.\u201d</p><p>Kiara surprises me sometimes. I\u2019m always shocked when she shows glimpses of her spicy attitude. \u201cYeah. Back in Mexico my friends and I went to clubs every weekend. We danced, met girls, drank, got high . . . fun stuff. Now I\u2019m here, having Family Fun Night with the Westfords. Times have definitely changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you do things you shouldn\u2019t do? Come on, Kiara, give it up. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re as innocent as you let everyone think you are. You\u2019re just like the rest of us sinners. So you don\u2019t smoke, drink, or do drugs. But you have other vices. Everyone does.\u201d When she doesn\u2019t answer, I continue. \u201cTell me somethin\u2019 you do that would shock me.\u201d</p><p>She sits back on the couch. \u201cShock you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Shock me to the core.\u201d</p><p>She sits up on her knees and leans toward me. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about you, Carlos,\u201d she whispers in my ear. \u201cAt night, in bed. I think about kissing you, our tongues sliding against each other\u2019s, while your hands are buried in my hair. When I think about feeling those ripples in your naked chest I touch my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s more popcorn!\u201d Westford says, barging into the room with two big bowls filled to the rim with freshly popped popcorn. \u201cKiara, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The scene must look pretty racy. Kiara is leaning over me on all fours. Her face is just inches from mine.</p><p>I swallow. What she was about to say formed an image in my mind that was almost too much to bear. I stare right into Kiara\u2019s eyes to see if she\u2019s bullshitting me or not, but I can\u2019t tell. She\u2019s got a fire in her eyes, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s from passion or from her excitement at trying to beat me with my own MO.</p><p>I stay silent and let Kiara take this one.</p><p>She leans back on her heels. \u201cUm . . . I . . . um . . . nothing really.\u201d</p><p>Westford looks to me for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you don\u2019t want to know,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d Mrs. W. asks, walking into the room.</p><p>The Professor hands me the bowl of popcorn as Mrs. W. settles back in her chair. I start munchin\u2019 so I don\u2019t have to talk.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t get a straight answer out of either one of these teenagers,\u201d Westford says.</p><p>Kiara settles herself on the other side of the couch. \u201cMom, Dad, what would you do if you came in here and found us kissing?\u201d</p><p>36</p><p>Kiara</p><p>I really meant to ask the question as a hypothetical. I didn\u2019t mean for Carlos to start choking on his popcorn, which he is.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I ask him as he coughs repeatedly.</p><p>Carlos looks at me like I\u2019m the craziest person on the planet. \u201cWhat the hell are you askin\u2019 them that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to know the answer.\u201d</p><p>I can tell my parents are trying to telepathically communicate to each other to come up with an answer.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . ,\u201d my mom starts. \u201cUm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat your mother is trying to say,\u201d my dad chimes in, \u201cis that we were teenagers once upon a time, too, so we understand that experimentation is a normal part of growing up . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know to always respect yourself and your bodies,\u201d my mom says. I suspect she\u2019s not answering the question on purpose.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d</p><p>My dad picks up the remote. \u201cOkay, now that that\u2019s settled, which movie did you pick?\u201d</p><p>I get a little shy when I say, \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d</p><p>We watch the movie, but every now and then Carlos snickers as if some of the parts are ridiculous to him. By the end, I\u2019m crying so hard Carlos has to pass me a tissue from the end table nearest him.</p><p>\u201cPass me one of those tissues, too,\u201d my mom says as she sniffs away. \u201cI cry every time I see that movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate the ending,\u201d I declare to everyone in the room as I take the movie out of the player and replace it with another one.</p><p>My dad turns around to face Carlos. \u201cWhat can I say? My women want a happy ending.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mom, with her hair up in a clip like a teenager herself, looks at my dad. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a happy ending?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not realistic,\u201d Carlos chimes in.</p><p>\u201cOn that note . . . I\u2019m going to bed. I\u2019m beat,\u201d my dad says, then moans and stretches as he stands up from his chair. \u201cThese old bones can\u2019t stay up past midnight anymore. I\u2019ll see you all in the morning.\u201d</p><p>My mom calls after him, \u201cI\u2019ll be up in a bit.\u201d</p> <p>We all agree to start another movie. This time it\u2019s an action film that\u2019s probably right up Carlos\u2019s alley. Ten minutes into it, my mom yawns. \u201cI\u2019m younger than your father, Kiara, but I can\u2019t stay up much past midnight anymore, either. I\u2019m going to bed.\u201d She gets up to leave, but before she turns the corner, she pauses the movie and wiggles her forefinger at us. \u201cTrust and respect.\u201d She says those few choice words, then tosses Carlos the remote before she disappears.</p><p>\u201cYour ma sure does know how to kill the mood,\u201d Carlos drawls.</p><p>As we continue watching the movie, I glance at Carlos a few times. I can tell he\u2019s into the movie because his features are relaxed, unlike his usual tense appearance.</p><p>One time he catches me watching him. \u201cWant some water?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>He disappears into the kitchen, then reappears a few minutes later carrying two glasses of ice water.</p><p>It\u2019s dark except for the glow of the television. His fingers graze mine as I take the glass from him. I don\u2019t know if he felt it, but I can\u2019t ignore my body\u2019s reaction to the soft touch of his hand brushing against mine. It\u2019s not like this morning after the game, where he did it for show.</p><p>He hesitates, then his eyes meet mine. It\u2019s dark, it\u2019s just us, and I\u2019d love nothing more than to tell him I want his hands on me, all over, although he\u2019d already said that my mom broke the mood.</p><p>Trust and respect. I trust Carlos not to hurt me physically, but not emotionally. I immediately break the connection and quickly raise the glass to my lips to drink the cold water, because if I didn\u2019t I might be tempted to ask him to kiss me again and force myself not to think about the consequences.</p><p>Without talking, he eases his lean body back on the couch. Our thighs are almost touching, and while the movie is still playing, all I can think about is him.</p><p>The hero is stuck in a warehouse with a beautiful blond woman. He suspects she might be one of the bad guys, but he can\u2019t resist her and they start making out.</p> <p>Carlos shifts, clears his throat, then takes another chug of water. Then another. And another.</p><p>I wonder if the scene reminds him of my detailed fantasy about us. I take a slow, deep breath and try to keep my mind on the movie and not on the fact that our knees are now touching.</p><p>A while later I glance at him. He looks like he might be sleeping, but I\u2019m not sure.</p><p>\u201cCarlos?\u201d I say tentatively.</p><p>He opens his eyes, those black depths shining from the light of the TV. The passion and desire are evident in his gaze. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you sleeping?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles. \u201cNo. Not by a long shot. I was just tryin\u2019 to convince myself not to make a move on you.\u201d</p><p>The movie forgotten, I push my fears aside and decide to test what we have together. I get off the couch to close the door to the den and lock it, giving us privacy.</p> <p>\u201cYou locked the door,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not good with words, and if I did try to say anything I\u2019d probably stutter and break the mood. If I can\u2019t effectively tell him how I feel, I can definitely show him. I suddenly realize that I trust this boy even if he doesn\u2019t trust himself.</p><p>Kneeling next to him on the couch, I slowly raise a shaky hand to his face. My fingers trace random designs in the stubble growing on his jaw. His breath hitches in response.</p><p>\u201cKiara\u2014\u201d</p><p>I put my fingers on his beautiful full lips and cut him off. \u201cShh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre . . . we . . . about to get into . . . trouble?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I lean forward. His words fade the closer my lips are to his. I move my palms to his chest and brace myself against his hard body as I move closer. And closer. I can feel the warm heat of his breath mingling with mine and I can\u2019t hold back any longer. \u201cLoads of trouble,\u201d I say. I know I can\u2019t hope to be his permanently, but I want to show him what intimacy with real emotion can feel like.</p><p>When my lips touch his the slightest bit, a quiet moan escapes from his mouth. His heart beats fast against my palms. The sweet sound of our lips parting and coming together again is melting my insides. He\u2019s letting me be in control by keeping his hands at his sides, but each time I lower my lips to his only to separate them a few seconds later, he starts breathing heavier.</p><p>\u201cLet me taste you,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>The next time I dip my head, I kiss him softly a few times, then gather enough courage to open my mouth and deepen the kiss. I get a surge of energy when our tongues meet for the first time, wet and slippery and, oh, I want more.</p><p>The sound of the movie is just white noise in the background.</p><p>He cradles my face in his hands and forces me to look into his dark, sexy eyes filled with passion and desire. \u201cYou\u2019re playin\u2019 a dangerous game, chica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I trust you.\u201d</p><p>37</p><p>Carlos</p><p>Her words echo in my head. I trust you. She\u2019s the first girl who\u2019s ever said that to me. Even Destiny said I had to earn her trust when we first met, because she thought I was a player. And here\u2019s Kiara, a girl who knows I\u2019ll never be her knight in shining armor, gifting me with her trust without hesitation. She\u2019s straddling me, her lips wet from our kisses. She\u2019s crazy to think I\u2019ll do the right thing.</p><p>My hands are still cradling her face. I respect this girl too much to be dishonest. \u201cDon\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>A pink blush creeps up her cheeks as she reaches behind her head and pulls that band out of her hair. \u201cBut I do.\u201d</p><p>She shakes out her hair. It falls in a curtain over her shoulders, the ends landing just above her breasts. I\u2019ve never seen anythin\u2019 sexier in my life, and she\u2019s not even naked yet.</p><p>Yet? What am I thinkin\u2019? I\u2019m not gettin\u2019 her naked. I want to. Hell, I\u2019d love to peel away the layers and study the curves of her body with my eyes and hands. My body says Go for it! You want it. She wants it. What\u2019s the problem?</p><p>The problem is that damn word . . . trust.</p><p>She trusts me.</p><p>I squeeze my eyes shut. What can I say to prove to her I\u2019m the bad boy she knows I am? She\u2019d be stupid to trust me. I\u2019ll take advantage of her every chance I get, but how can I prove that to her?</p><p>Knowing how ready I am to take this to the next level might scare her off. I reach around and grab her butt, then grind against her in a way that makes no mistake of my intent.</p><p>Problem is, she starts moving with me. Damn. This is not good. She\u2019s definitely got power over me. I thrive on control, but right now I\u2019ve totally lost it.</p><p>I pull her toward me and press her body to mine, my hands feelin\u2019 up and down her back. Our heavy breathing is filling the room. I\u2019m glad the movie is still on to mask any sounds we\u2019re making.</p><p>I lean back and look into her trusting face.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta stop before this gets out of hand, \u2019cause I won\u2019t.\u201d I\u2019m ignoring the fact that we\u2019ve already gotten out of hand and she doesn\u2019t look the least bit ready to stop.</p><p>She stills and presses her cheek to mine. \u201cI\u2019m a virgin,\u201d she whispers in my ear as if it\u2019s a secret she\u2019s only going to share with me.</p><p>Oh, hell.</p><p>I lean my head back on the couch and tell her the truth. \u201cYou\u2019re not actin\u2019 like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s you, Carlos. Only you do this to me.\u201d</p><p>Power shift. She shouldn\u2019t have said that. Now I know I have control, if not physically, at least mentally. Givin\u2019 me control isn\u2019t a wise move on her part.</p><p>I\u2019m taking this girl to the danger zone, but that\u2019s where I\u2019m used to spendin\u2019 most of my life. My hands inch over to her waist.</p><p>\u201cTake your shirt off, chica.\u201d</p><p>Her hands go to the bottom of her shirt. The anticipation of seeing what she\u2019s hiding underneath makes me hold my breath. I look up into her face, her eyes filled with uncertainty and something else I refuse to acknowledge.</p><p>In one swift movement, she lifts her oversized T-shirt over her head and reveals a body to kill for or die for. Or both.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a body like Madison\u2019s,\u201d she says shyly, her hands crossing her midsection in an effort to hide it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not skinny.\u201d</p><p>Skinny to me equals fake body or no body. I need a girl who I can hold on to and not be afraid to break.</p><p>I gently remove her hands and hold them lightly at her sides. I lean back and stare, completely dumbfounded, at her pink bra modestly covering her breasts. She\u2019s got nothin\u2019 to be embarrassed about. This girl has got it goin\u2019 on and has no clue she\u2019s got a better body than Madison, hands down. Kiara\u2019s got curves where God intended them to be, and I have the urge to caress those curves and memorize every inch of her. I feel like the luckiest guy on earth. \u201cEres hermosa . . . you\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes are cast downward. \u201cLook at me, chica.\u201d When she does, I repeat, \u201cEres hermosa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward and trails little kisses across my lips. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she whispers, then bites her bottom lip as she waits for me to strip off my shirt.</p><p>I immediately toss my shirt to the side.</p><p>\u201cCan I touch you?\u201d she asks, as if she doesn\u2019t have complete owner-ship of my body at this moment.</p><p>I take her hand in mine and guide her to my bare skin. When I let go so she can explore on her own, her fingers trail slow paths up and down my chest. Each touch sears my skin from the inside out, and when her fingers linger on the tattoo peeking out of my jeans and dip into the waistband, it\u2019s almost my undoing.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that say?\u201d she asks as she lightly traces one of my tattoos.</p><p>\u201cRebel,\u201d I tell her. My fingers weave into her hair and I lean her toward me. I need to taste her again. I need to feel her soft lips on mine. We start making out like it\u2019s the first time and maybe our last, our breaths and tongues collide almost desperately.</p><p>While she continues her exploration, I focus all my attention on her. I slide her bra straps down until they fall loosely on her arms. She leans back and I can\u2019t imagine a sexier image or a sexier girl than the one sitting atop me. My pulse quickens in hot anticipation as I slide the silky fabric aside.</p><p>Her fingers go still as my hands touch the sides of her waist and slide up until my thumbs reach the curve of her breast. Nothing could prepare me for the wave of emotions I\u2019m feeling right now as I look into Kiara\u2019s sparkling eyes.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m falling in love with you,\u201d she says so softly it might be my imagination, then I hear the sound of gunfire.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In a frenzied panic, I pull Kiara down on the couch and lay atop her to save her from danger.</p><p>I look up, confused. Wait, nobody is in the room besides us. What the hell?</p><p>I look at the television screen and see the hero of the movie standing over the body of a dead guy with blood streaming out of his chest. The gunshots were coming from the television.</p><p>I look back at a stunned, scared, half-naked Kiara.</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say, moving off her and shifting to the other side of the couch. \u201cSorry. It was only the TV.\u201d My heart is beating faster than a drum at a rock concert. When I heard the gunshots I\u2019d have done anything to protect her life. Even if it meant sacrificing my own. The thought of losing her in the same way I lost my father and almost lost Alex is just too much. I\u2019m practically hyperventilating from the thought of it.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I broke my number one rule: never get emotionally involved.</p><p>Whatever happened to foolin\u2019 around only with girls who want nothin\u2019 more than a good time? The word \u201camor,\u201d or the English equivalent, \u201clove,\u201d isn\u2019t in my vocabulary. I\u2019m not boyfriend material. If you want love and commitment, don\u2019t come knockin\u2019 at my door. I have to get out before I\u2019m in too deep.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d She sits up and leans over me, her body too close. I can\u2019t think straight when I can feel the heat of her body penetrate mine. I feel claustrophobic and trapped. I have to get out of here.</p> <p>I gently move her away so there\u2019s distance between us.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay. This isn\u2019t okay.\u201d My reaction to the gunshots puts everything back into perspective. I can\u2019t do this with Kiara. I press my palms against my eyes and breathe out a frustrated sigh. \u201cCover yourself,\u201d I say, then pick up her shirt.</p><p>When I toss the oversized T-shirt to her, I tell myself to avoid meeting her gaze. I don\u2019t want to see the hurt in her eyes and know I was the one who put it there.</p><p>\u201cI w-w-wanted th-th-this,\u201d she stutters in a shaky voice. \u201cY-y-you d-d-did, t-t-too.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Now she\u2019s so emotional she can hardly get a word out without stumbling all over it. It would be better for her to hate me than fall in love with me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I want a girl who\u2019ll fuck around with me, not declare her undying love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI d-d-didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>I put up a hand, stopping her. I know what she\u2019s gonna say, that she never said this would turn into something more. \u201cYou said you were fallin\u2019 in love with me, and that\u2019s the last thing a guy like me needs to hear. Admit it, Kiara. Girls like you want to cut guys\u2019 nuts off and hang \u2019em from your rearview mirror.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m rambling like a complete pendejo, the words streaming out of my mouth without my even thinking about what I\u2019m saying. I know I\u2019m hurting her with each word. It\u2019s practically killin\u2019 me to do this to her, but she needs to know I\u2019m not the one who\u2019ll be there to catch her when she falls. I\u2019ve still got Devlin to deal with, and I might not come back alive. The last thing I\u2019d ever want is for Kiara to be mourning someone who didn\u2019t deserve her love in the first place.</p><p>\u201cWe can be friends\u2014,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cFriends who fool around, without any emotion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot gonna happen. You want more, go find yourself another sucker.\u201d I head for the door, needing to get away from her before I kneel down and beg her to take me back into her arms and finish what we started. As I leave her, I try to shove all images of her out of my head. Fat chance of that anytime soon.</p> <p>Back in my room, I sit on my bed. There\u2019s no use tryin\u2019 to get any sleep. I know that\u2019s not gonna happen tonight. I shake my head, wondering how I got myself into this mess. Leavin\u2019 her in that room was the first selfless thing I\u2019ve done since I came to Colorado.</p><p>And I feel like complete crap.</p><p>38</p><p>Kiara</p><p>I sit in the den and go over in my head what happened tonight. As much as I told myself that fooling around with him wouldn\u2019t make our relationship serious, I hoped otherwise. I knew exactly what I was doing, and the fact that it backfired just brought home the fact that Carlos is right. He\u2019s not boyfriend material. He only wants a girl who\u2019ll take her clothes off for him without a commitment or promise.</p><p>He wants a girl like Madison.</p><p>I made a complete fool out of myself tonight. To think that sharing my body with him would make him change was stupid. Did I really think an amazing physical connection between us could make him want a permanent relationship with me? The fact is, I did.</p><p>When we kissed tonight it was perfect. It was everything I wanted and expected and hoped for. As soon as he cupped my face in his hands, I was lost. I knew nothing I had or could have with Michael would ever compete with the intensity of what Carlos and I were sharing.</p><p>Now all of that is shattered, because Carlos pushed me away. After that, my tongue got heavy and every word I uttered came out as a stutter.</p><p>Oh, I am beyond embarrassed. How am I going to face him in the morning? Worse, how am I going to face myself?</p><p>39</p><p>Carlos</p><p>I got about two hours of sleep last night. When the sun wakes me up, I moan and roll over to try and get more sleep. It\u2019s hard to do when the entire room is painted the same color as the damn sun. Next time I\u2019m at the hardware store I need to get some black paint to darken this place to match my mood.</p><p>I lie on my side and hold a pillow over my eyes. The next time I open them, it\u2019s ten.</p><p>I call mi'am\u00e1, just because I need to hear her voice again. She says that she\u2019s trying to get tickets to visit, and I detect an excitement I haven\u2019t heard from her in years. It reminds me that I told Mrs. W. I\u2019d help out at the store today. I\u2019ll send mi'am\u00e1 the extra money I make so she can add it to the trip fund.</p><p>After I shower, I knock on Kiara\u2019s bedroom door. She\u2019s not there, so I head downstairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Kiara?\u201d I ask Brandon, who\u2019s playin\u2019 some computer game in the Professor\u2019s office.</p><p>He\u2019s either ignoring me or doesn\u2019t hear me.</p><p>\u201cYo, Racer!\u201d I yell.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Brandon says, not turning around.</p><p>I stand next to him and check out the game he\u2019s addicted to. On the screen are a bunch of cartoon characters walking in a park. In the corner of the screen it says: Commodities: Cocaine, 3 grams; Marijuana, 7 grams.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of game is this?\u201d I ask the kid.</p><p>\u201cA trading game.\u201d</p><p>The kid is a damn cyber drug dealer. \u201cTurn it off,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Cause it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Brandon looks up at me with innocent eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve never played it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I have.\u201d The real-life game. And that\u2019s only because I had to do it to survive. But Brandon has choices in life, and doesn\u2019t need to deal drugs to survive. No use in havin\u2019 him play a game that simulates it when he\u2019s in kindergarten. \u201cTurn it off, Brandon, or I will. I\u2019m not kiddin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He sticks his chin in the air and continues playing. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Westford says, walking into the room.</p><p>\u201cCarlos told me I have to turn off my game. Daddy, you told me I can go on your computer and play a trading game. All my friends play it.\u201d</p><p>I point to Brandon. \u201cYour son and his friends are cyber drug dealers,\u201d I tell his father.</p><p>Westford\u2019s eyes go wide and he rushes to the screen. \u201cDrug dealers? Brandon, what are you playing?\u201d</p><p>I walk out of the room when Westford tells Brandon that illegal drugs are not a commodity. Then he mumbles something about parental controls and how they can\u2019t replace parents and he should have supervised more closely.</p><p>I wander outside and find Kiara working on her car, her legs and feet sticking out of the driver\u2019s side door. I watch as she works upside down, her head under the dash, and a screwdriver in her hands.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d she says without looking up.</p><p>\u201cCan I take a look at the door? Maybe I can fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s busted. You can\u2019t go around with it like that forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>I lean against the side of the car. And wait. And wait. If she doesn\u2019t shimmy herself out in a few minutes I\u2019m tempted to drag her ass out.</p><p>Westford walks out of the house. \u201cKiara, what time are you and Carlos going to Hospitali-Tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I can tape this wire together, Dad. It won\u2019t cooperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably need to solder it,\u201d I tell her, although at this point it\u2019s pretty obvious she doesn\u2019t want any suggestions from me.</p><p>\u201cLet me know when you\u2019re ready to go. In the meantime, I need a word with Carlos.\u201d Westford crooks his finger at me. \u201cMeet me in my office.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t look or sound too happy with me. Truth is, he shouldn\u2019t be. Last night I had my hands full with his daughter.</p><p>I pass Brandon watching some cartoon in the den on my way to the Professor\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d I ask as I take a seat.</p><p>\u201cObviously not this.\u201d He tosses me my shirt from last night. \u201cI found it on the floor of the den. It\u2019s obvious there was some hanky-panky going on.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so he knows we fooled around. But at least he didn\u2019t find Kiara\u2019s bra on top of my shirt.</p><p>\u201cYeah . . . things kinda got a little heated after you and Mrs. W. left the den last night,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that. Colleen and I believe in open communication with our kids. And while you\u2019re not one of my own, I\u2019m responsible for you at this point.\u201d The Professor rubs his hand across his face and sucks in a breath. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d be prepared for this talk. Once upon a time I was a teenager and did the same thing in my parents\u2019 house.\u201d He looks up. \u201cOf course, I was a little more diligent about hiding the evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t happen again, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, leaving the evidence or you fooling around in my house with my daughter? And please cut the \u2018sir\u2019 bullshit. This isn\u2019t the military.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the one who forced myself on him, Dad,\u201d Kiara says, appearing in the doorway. \u201cIt was not his fault.\u201d</p><p>The Professor winces as he says, \u201cIt takes two to tango. I\u2019m not placing blame or fault. I\u2019m just discussing. I wish your mother was here to have this talk. Did you, uh, protect yourselves at least?\u201d</p><p>Kiara moans, totally embarrassed. \u201cDad, we didn\u2019t have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m in the middle of this conversation. Mexican dads don\u2019t have these kinds of talks, especially with the boys their daughters are foolin\u2019 around with. They\u2019d kick the boy\u2019s ass first, then ask questions. After that, they\u2019d forbid their daughter to go outside without a chaperone. There\u2019s none of this \u201copen communication\u201d bullshit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel like I\u2019m on a white people self-help show, and I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to say. I\u2019m also not used to a father who wants to actually talk about shit like this. Is this normal, or does it only happen with dads who happen to be psychologists who\u2019re trying to shrink our brains?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid enough to think that I can prevent you from doing . . . whatever it is you two were doing,\u201d Westford continues. \u201cBut I\u2019m instituting a new rule: no more monkey business between you two under my roof. If I make it harder for you, maybe you\u2019ll make better choices. And I should also tell you, as your father, Kiara, and your guardian, Carlos, to stay a virgin until you get married.\u201d He sits back in his chair and smiles at us, mighty pleased with himself for that last sentence. Too bad this discussion is a few years too late, at least for me.</p><p>\u201cWere you a virgin when you got married?\u201d I ask, challenging him. Immediately his grin fades.</p><p>\u201cYes, um, well, um . . . when I was a teen it was a very different day and age. Teens today are smarter and more educated. There are incurable diseases . . . and dangers for both partners if you\u2019re not in a serious, monogamous, committed relationship.\u201d He wiggles a finger at both of us. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget the big p-word.\u201d</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but chuckle. \u00bfPerd\u00f3n? \u201cThe p-word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnancy!\u201d The Professor narrows his eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to be a grandpa for a long, long, long, long time.\u201d</p><p>I think about my mom, who got pregnant with Alex when she was seventeen. Mi'am\u00e1 made me promise to always wear a condom if I was ever physical with a girl\u2014 she never wanted one of her sons to end up like her and mi pap\u00e1. Hell, she even hid some condoms in a pair of my underwear as a reminder.</p><p>Last night scared the shit out of me. \u2019Cause while I\u2019ve always had my head on straight when it comes to protectin\u2019 myself and the girl I\u2019m with, I can\u2019t say I would\u2019ve been able to stop us last night even though I didn\u2019t have a condom within reach. And I wasn\u2019t even wasted. If I hadn\u2019t been scared half to death from those gunshots comin\u2019 from the TV, Kiara and I might be having a very different talk with the Professor right now.</p><p>\u201cDad, we know about all that,\u201d Kiara chimes in.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to have a refresher talk, in light of the fact that Carlos\u2019s shirt was lying on the floor in the den this morning.\u201d</p><p>When I hold up the shirt so she knows what he\u2019s talking about, Kiara chokes out a surprised, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Westford checks the clock on his desk. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get Brandon outside before he develops ADD from watching too much television.\u201d He holds his hands out as if he\u2019s about to hand me an offering. \u201cCarlos, are we in complete understanding with each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not in your house and you don\u2019t know about it, you\u2019re okay with us messin\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re joking with me. You are joking with me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>Kiara steps in the room. \u201cDad, he was kidding.\u201d</p><p>The Professor counts off each word on his fingers and gives me a level stare. \u201cDon\u2019t forget . . . (1) serious, (2) monogamous, (3) committed relationship, (4) not under my roof, and (5) trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t forget (6) the p-word,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>He nods. \u201cYes. The p-word. One day in the military, Carlos, and they\u2019d kick that cockiness of yours right out the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad I\u2019m not plannin\u2019 on signin\u2019 up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is too bad. If you ever did sign up and put as much energy into being a good soldier as you do trying to have a major attitude, you\u2019d go far. I\u2019m tempted to put something red inside the laundry so your underwear turns pink. It would be a little reminder of our talk today.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t wear underwear,\u201d I lie.</p><p>\u201cOut, wise guy,\u201d he orders, shooing us out the door. I think I catch the side of his mouth quirk up, amused at my comeback, but it quickly disappears. \u201cBoth of you, out of my office. And let\u2019s keep this talk between just us. Now get your butts over to Hospitali-Tea. My wife is expecting to put you both to work today. Don\u2019t stop on the way,\u201d he calls out when we\u2019re in the hallway. \u201cI\u2019m calling there in fifteen minutes to make sure you\u2019ve arrived.\u201d</p> <p>40</p><p>Kiara</p><p>\u201cListen, chica\u2014,\u201d Carlos says when we\u2019re driving to my mom\u2019s store a few minutes later.</p><p>My hands tighten on the steering wheel. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that anymore,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to call you, then?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWhatever. Just not chica.\u201d I reach down to turn on my stereo but realize it still doesn\u2019t work. I grip the steering wheel tighter and concentrate on the road ahead, even when we\u2019re at a stoplight.</p><p>Carlos holds his hands up. \u201cWhat do you want from me? You want me to tell you lies, is that what you want? Okay, I\u2019ll give you lies. Kiara, without you I\u2019m nothin\u2019. Kiara, you own my heart and soul. Kiara, when I\u2019m not with you I feel like life has no meaning. Kiara, I love you. Is that what you want to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo guy who actually says those things really means them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet your brother says them to Brittany and means them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s lost all common sense. I thought you were the one girl who didn\u2019t fall for my bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Consider my wanting you as my real boyfriend as a lapse in judgment,\u201d I tell him. \u201cBut I\u2019m over it. I expect less than nothing from you from now on, and I\u2019ve realized you\u2019re not my type at all. In fact,\u201d I say, glancing at him, \u201cI might call Michael. He wants to go out again.\u201d</p><p>Carlos reaches down to my purse and pulls my phone from the side pocket. I try to snatch it out of his hand, but he\u2019s too quick. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcentrate on the road, Kiara. You wouldn\u2019t want to get into an accident \u2019cause you weren\u2019t payin\u2019 attention, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it back,\u201d I order.</p><p>\u201cI will. I need to check somethin\u2019 first.\u201d</p><p>At the next stoplight, I reach over and take the phone out of his hand. I read the text message Carlos just sent Michael. 4Q. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did.\u201d He sits back, looking pretty pleased with himself. \u201cYou can thank me later.\u201d</p><p>Thank him? Thank him! I pull off the road, pick up my purse, and swing it like a war club aiming right at Carlos\u2019s head.</p><p>He grabs the purse before it hits him. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you really wanted to go out with that tool again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want anymore.\u201d</p><p>I get back on the road, heading for my mom\u2019s shop. I stop the car and get out, without waiting for Carlos.</p><p>\u201cKiara, wait.\u201d Carlos growls as he climbs out of the window. I hear him jog to catch up with me. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fix that damn car door if it\u2019s the last thing I ever do.\u201d He rubs his hand through his hair. \u201cListen, if things were different . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>I turn my back on him. If he won\u2019t tell me, there\u2019s no use in arguing.</p><p>\u201cHi, guys!\u201d My mom greets us at the front of the store, so our conversation is cut short. \u201cKiara, I pulled out the receipts from last month and the past week. Feel free to reconcile those. Carlos, come with me.\u201d</p><p>While I sit in the office and tally receipts and reconcile the books, I hear my mom explain to Carlos how to separate the boxes of loose teas that were just delivered.</p><p>At around one, my mom peeks her head in the door and tells me to meet her in the break room for lunch. My mom is oblivious to the tension in the air as we all sit in the break room. She expects everyone to be happy and energetic all the time, so I wonder when she\u2019ll notice the happiness quotient in the room is way off.</p><p>\u201cI got this from Teddy, the vendor outside the store,\u201d she says as she pulls food out from a bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Carlos asks as she hands him one.</p><p>\u201cOrganic vegan dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a vegan dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vegetarian hot dog,\u201d she says. \u201cWith no animal products.\u201d</p><p>Carlos unwraps his hot dog uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t kill you to eat healthy, Carlos,\u201d my mom says. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t like it, I can go out and get you processed food if you want.\u201d</p><p>I start eating my vegan dog. I don\u2019t mind eating all the healthy stuff my mom makes, but I definitely like processed food every now and then.</p><p>Carlos bites into his. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good. Got any fries to go with it?\u201d</p><p>I almost laugh when my mom dumps out a bunch of orange fries on top of a napkin. \u201cThey\u2019re baked sweet potato fries. With the skin on, to give you more fiber. If I\u2019m not mistaken, I think they\u2019ve also got omega-3 fatty acids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to eat without thinkin\u2019 about what\u2019s inside,\u201d Carlos says as he munches away.</p><p>My mom pours us glasses of iced tea from a big pitcher she made for us. \u201cYou should care about what goes in your body. For example, this tea blend has a\u00e7a\u00ed, orange-peel extract, and mint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, eat,\u201d I tell her. Before I know it, she\u2019ll go through an entire explanation of antioxidants and free radicals.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d She takes out her hot dog and starts eating. \u201cSo how was the movie last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d I say, hoping she doesn\u2019t ask details because I have no clue what the movie was about.</p><p>She picks up a fry and bites off the tip. \u201cIt seemed a little violent. I\u2019m not into violent movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either,\u201d I say. Carlos stays silent. I feel his gaze on me, but I don\u2019t look up. I focus my attention on everything else besides him.</p><p>Iris, one of my mom\u2019s weekend employees, opens the break-room door. \u201cColleen, you\u2019ve got a customer specifically requesting you. She seems as if she\u2019s in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>My mom takes the last bite of her dog. \u201cDuty calls.\u201d</p><p>I get up to leave too, but Carlos reaches out and takes hold of my wrist. God, how I want him to pull me toward him and tell me that last night wasn\u2019t a mistake. This thing between us doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you, you know. I haven\u2019t wanted to be with a girl so bad since . . .\u201d His voice trails off and he lets go of my wrist.</p><p>\u201cSince who?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does to me.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, as if he doesn\u2019t want to say her name. When he finally says \u201cDestiny,\u201d he can\u2019t hide that he still has feelings for her. Her name rolls off his tongue as if he savors each syllable.</p><p>I\u2019m definitely jealous. There\u2019s no way I can compete with Destiny. Carlos obviously still loves her. \u201cI get it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Last night freaked the hell out of me, Kiara. Because I felt somethin\u2019 I haven\u2019t felt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince Destiny,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let myself fall that hard for a girl ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I still supposed to pretend I\u2019m dating you at school?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust for a couple more weeks, until Madison decides she\u2019s movin\u2019 on.\u201d He looks up at me. \u201cThen we can create a fake reason to break up. We made a deal, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>Back in my mom\u2019s office, I look down at the tallies in front of me. The numbers are a blur. Tossing my pencil aside, I put my head in my hands and sigh.</p><p>I was so stupid last night to tell Carlos I was falling in love with him. I definitely scared him away. All my life, until now, I\u2019ve held back. And then I met Carlos, a guy who makes me want to forge ahead and never regret a single moment.</p><p>When he played soccer with my brother, and I saw a glimpse of generosity that he only gifts to the few he thinks are worthy, I knew that what you see isn\u2019t necessarily what you get when it comes to Carlos.</p> <p>At the end of the day I find him in the back room, carefully measuring the various ingredients for my mom\u2019s homemade blends.</p><p>\u201cI came up with a fake reason why we\u2019d break up,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cHit me with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re still in love with Destiny.\u201d</p><p>His fingers go completely still. \u201cPick somethin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Just somethin\u2019 else.\u201d He puts the ingredients back on the shelves. \u201cI\u2019m gonna walk to the auto-body shop to talk to Alex. Tell your parents I\u2019ll be home later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can drive you,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m leaving now, too.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI want to walk.\u201d I watch as he heads out the back door a few minutes later, leaving me wondering if he just wants to get away from me as fast as he can.</p><p>41</p><p>Carlos</p><p>When I\u2019m far enough away from the tea store, I pull out the cell phone Brittany gave me. I punch in Devlin\u2019s number and wait.</p><p>As soon as I hear him pick up, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s Carlos Fuentes. You wanted my attention, you\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Se\u00f1or Fuentes. I was waiting for you to contact me,\u201d a smooth voice says from the other end of the line. It\u2019s got to be Devlin.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d I ask, letting him know right away I\u2019m not fuckin\u2019 around.</p><p>\u201cI just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>I keep walking as I talk because I\u2019ve got a crazy feeling the guy has people tailing me. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have done that without havin\u2019 Nick Glass set me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to get your attention, Fuentes. But now that I have it, it\u2019s time for us to meet.\u201d</p><p>My entire body tenses. Whether I want to meet Devlin or not, it\u2019s gonna happen. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have guys tailin\u2019 me?\u201d I ask, even though I know the answer before I even ask the question.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Fuentes. I\u2019m a businessman, and you\u2019re my newest apprentice. I\u2019ve got to keep my eye out for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t agreed to do shit for you,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cNo, but you will. I\u2019ve been told you\u2019ve got what it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say a little Guerrero told me. Enough talk. When you see one of my guys drive up, get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know it\u2019s one of your guys?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>Devlin laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>The phone goes dead. A few minutes later a black SUV with tinted windows stops right in front of me. I take a deep breath when the door opens. I\u2019m ready to face whatever lies beyond. No matter whateveryone in mi familia thinks, this is my destiny.</p><p>I slide into the backseat and recognize Diego Rodriguez sitting next to me, a Guerrero who was so high up he was always talked about but rarely seen. I nod and wonder what he\u2019s doing with Wes Devlin. I know some guys consider themselves hybrids and jump gang affiliations, but I\u2019d never actually seen anyone so high up in an organization get away with it.</p><p>\u201cLong time no see,\u201d Rodriguez says. Up front are two white guys who look like they\u2019re both bodybuilders or at least trained to kick ass. They\u2019re definitely here to protect someone, and that someone definitely isn\u2019t me.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Devlin?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet him soon enough.\u201d</p><p>I look out the window to see if I can tell where we\u2019re headed, but it\u2019s no use. I\u2019m totally lost and at the mercy of these three guys. I wonder what Kiara would do if she knew I was in a car with a bunch of thugs. She\u2019d probably tell me I shouldn\u2019t have gone in the car in the first place. I\u2019m not letting my guard down for one minute, that\u2019s for sure.</p><p>Thinking about letting my guard down makes me think of Kiara. Last night as I had her in my arms and felt her soft skin beneath my fingers, I totally lost control. Hell, I was ready to take anything she had to offer without caring about the consequences.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Diego says, pullin\u2019 me out of my thoughts of Kiara and what might have been.</p><p>\u201cHere\u201d is a big house with a cement wall surrounding the estate. We\u2019re buzzed through. Diego directs me through the front door and leads me to an office big enough to intimidate any corporate CEO.</p><p>The blond guy sitting behind a dark wooden desk is obviously Devlin. He\u2019s wearing a dark suit with a light blue tie that matches his eyes. He motions for me to sit in one of the guest chairs in front of his desk. When I don\u2019t, the two overgrown guys from the car ride stand on either side of me.</p><p>I\u2019m in dangerous territory, but I stand my ground. \u201cGet your trained dogs away from me,\u201d I tell him. Devlin waves them away, and the two guys immediately back off and block the door to the room. I wonder how much he pays them to be his guard dogs.</p><p>Diego is still in the room, a silent second in command. Devlin leans back in his chair, assessing me. \u201cSo you\u2019re Carlos Fuentes, the one Diego here has been telling me so much about. He says you skipped out on the Guerreros del barrio. Bold move, Carlos, although I assume if you step one foot back in Mexico you\u2019re as good as dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what this is all about?\u201d I ask. \u201cIf you\u2019ve affiliated yourself with the Guerreros and they told you to get rid of me, why have Nick set me up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re not going to get rid of you, Fuentes,\u201d Diego chimes in. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use you.\u201d</p><p>Those words make me want to lash out and tell these guys that nobody is going to control me or use me, but I hold back. The more these guys talk, the more information I can get.</p><p>\u201cTruth is, Fuentes,\u201d Diego says, \u201cwe\u2019re doin\u2019 you a favor by not bringin\u2019 you back to the Guerreros in pieces, and you\u2019re gonna do us a favor by being our bag boy.\u201d</p><p>Bag boy. He means I have to be their newest street dealer, and willingly take the fall if I get caught. The drugs in my locker were a test to see if I\u2019d turn Nick in. If I did, I\u2019d be pegged a snitch and probably be lying in the morgue right now. I proved I\u2019m not a narc, so now I\u2019m a valuable commodity. It reminds me of Brandon\u2019s video game, although this game is lethal.</p><p>Devlin leans forward. \u201cLet\u2019s just put it this way, Fuentes. You work with us, you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. Besides that, you\u2019ll be a rich kid.\u201d He pulls out an envelope from the desk drawer and slides it over to me. \u201cTake a look.\u201d</p><p>I pick up the envelope. Inside are a bunch of one hundred\u2013dollar bills\u2014more than I\u2019ve ever held in my hands before. I set the envelope back on his desk.</p><p>\u201cTake it, it\u2019s yours,\u201d Devlin says. \u201cConsider it a taste of what you can earn with me in one week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the Devlin family has aligned with the Guerreros? When did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI align with whoever and whatever gets me to my ultimate goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your goal, world domination?\u201d I joke.</p><p>Devlin doesn\u2019t laugh. \u201cRight now it\u2019s to bring in shipments I\u2019ve got coming in from Mexico and make sure they don\u2019t get misplaced, if you know what I mean. Rodriguez here thinks you\u2019ve got what it takes. Listen, I\u2019m not the head of a street gang that fights for territory, the color of your skin, or your damn nationality. I\u2019m a businessman, running a business. I could give a shit if you\u2019re black, white, Asian, or Mexican. Hell, I\u2019ve got more Russians working for me than the Kremlin. As long as you benefit my business, I want you working for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t want in?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Devlin looks to Rodriguez.</p><p>\u201cYour mam\u00e1 lives in Atencingo, doesn\u2019t she?\u201d Rodriguez asks casually as he steps forward. \u201cAnd your little brother, too. I think his name is Luis. Cute kid. I\u2019ve had a guy watching them for weeks now. One word from me and bullets will fly. They\u2019ll be dead before they even know what hit \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>I lunge toward Rodriguez, not caring that he\u2019s most likely packing. Nobody gets away with threatening my family. He\u2019s shielding his face with his hands, but I\u2019m fast and get a piece of him before the two big guys grab my arms and pull me away. \u201cIf you hurt mi familia, I\u2019ll rip your fuckin\u2019 heart out with my own two hands,\u201d I warn as I struggle to free myself.</p><p>Rodriguez cups his cheek where I clocked him. \u201cDon\u2019t let him go,\u201d he orders, then swears at me in a mixture of English and Spanish. \u201cYou\u2019re loco, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. Muy loco,\u201d I tell him as one of the guys makes the mistake of loosening his hold to get a better grip on me. I kick him away and send him crashing into a painting on the wall. When it cracks and smashes to the ground upon impact, I turn to see what other damage I can do to show I\u2019m not someone who\u2019ll shrink back in fear if my family is threatened.</p><p>Two more guys storm into the room. Shit. I\u2019m tough and can kick some ass, but five against one is bad odds. Not counting Devlin, who is sitting in his big leather chair watching the rest of us duke it out as if we\u2019re doing it solely for his amusement.</p><p>I manage to break free, then hold my own for a few minutes before two of the guys rush me and slam me into the wall. I\u2019m dazed from the impact when another guy starts pounding on me. It might be Rodriguez, or it might be one of the four other guys. At this point it\u2019s all a blur.</p><p>I struggle against them, but each punch to my stomach is taking its toll and hurts like hell. When a fist connects with my jaw once, then twice, then three times, I taste blood. I\u2019ve become their damn punching bag.</p><p>I gather all my energy, ignore the intense pain, and break free. Lunging forward, I connect hard with one of them. I won\u2019t go down without a fight, even one I have no chance of winning.</p><p>My advantage is short-lived. I\u2019m pulled off the guy and shoved to the carpeted floor. If I get up maybe I can do more damage, but I\u2019m being pummeled and kicked from all directions and feel my energy fading fast. A solid, painful kick to my back tells me one of the guys wears steel-toed boots. With my last ounce of energy, I grab the leg of whoever is kicking me. He tumbles forward, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ve got nothing left. No fight, no energy . . . just piercing pain with every move I make. The only thing I can do is pray to pass out soon . . . or die. At this point, either one would be welcome. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I stop fighting, Devlin yells for them to stop. \u201cGet him up,\u201d he orders.</p><p>I\u2019m forced into the chair facing Devlin, who\u2019s still looking like a powerful CEO in his unwrinkled suit. My shirt is ripped in several places and has blood splattered all over it.</p><p>Devlin jerks back my head. \u201cConsider this a jumping out of the Guerreros del barrio and a jumping in to the Devlin family. You\u2019re a Devlin now. I know you won\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. Hell, I don\u2019t even know if I could respond even if I wanted to. I do know that I\u2019m not a Devlin and will never be a Devlin.</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate your spirit, but don\u2019t mess up my house or fight with my guys again or you\u2019re a dead man.\u201d He walks out of the room, but not before ordering his guys to clean up his office before he gets back.</p><p>I\u2019m hauled out of the chair. The next thing I know, I\u2019m being shoved into the backseat of the SUV.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fight me or Devlin,\u201d Rodriguez says as we drive back. \u201cWe\u2019ve got big plans, and I need you. Devlin\u2019s guys don\u2019t have the Mexican connections we have. That makes us valuable.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not feeling too valuable right now. My head feels like it\u2019s about to explode. \u201cStop the car,\u201d Rodriguez orders when we\u2019re a few houses away from the Westfords\u2019. He opens the door and drags me out. \u201cMake sure you take care of that girl who you\u2019re livin\u2019 with. I wouldn\u2019t want anythin\u2019 to happen to her.\u201d He gets back in the car and tosses the envelope of money at my feet. \u201cYou should be as good as new in a week. I\u2019ll contact you then,\u201d he says, and drives off.</p><p>I can hardly stand, but I force myself to the front door of the Westfords\u2019 house. I bet I look the same as I feel: like complete shit. Once inside, I try to sneak upstairs so nobody sees what a bloody mess I am, careful to keep my shirt against my mouth so I don\u2019t drip blood on the carpet.</p> <p>I head straight for the bathroom. Problem is, Kiara is walking out of it just as I try to enter it.</p><p>She takes one look at me, gasps, and covers her mouth with her hand. \u201cCarlos! Oh my God, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still recognize me with a busted-up face. That\u2019s a good sign, right?\u201d</p><p>42</p><p>Kiara</p><p>My heart pounds wildly in fear and shock as Carlos moves past me and leans over the sink.</p> <p>\u201cClose the door,\u201d he says, moaning in pain as he spits blood into the sink. \u201cI don\u2019t want your parents to see me.\u201d</p><p>I lock the door and rush to him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got my ass kicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s obvious.\u201d I grab a navy towel off the rack and wet it in the sink. \u201cBy who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to know.\u201d He rinses out his mouth, then looks at himself in the mirror. His lip is cut and still bleeding, and his left eye is swollen. By the way he\u2019s leaning on the sink I can just imagine how the rest of him feels.</p><p>\u201cI think you need to go to the hospital,\u201d I tell him. \u201cAnd call the police.\u201d</p><p>He turns to me and winces, the movement obviously painful. \u201cNo hospital. No police,\u201d he says, moaning each word. \u201cI\u2019ll be better in the mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that.\u201d When he winces again, I feel his pain as if it\u2019s my own. \u201cSit,\u201d I say, pointing to the edge of the tub. \u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p> <p>Carlos must really be drained emotionally as well as physically, because he sits on the edge of the tub and stays still while I wet the towel again and gently wipe the blood off the lips that only last night were smiling when I kissed him. They\u2019re not smiling now.</p><p>I carefully dab at his open cuts, painfully aware of how close we are. He stills my hand as I move the towel across his swollen face. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says as I look into his sad eyes.</p><p>I need to break the intensity of his gaze, so I wet the towel in the sink, and wring it out. \u201cI just hope the other guy looks worse.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a small laugh. \u201cThere were five other guys. They all look better than me, although I held my own for a while. You would\u2019ve been proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that. Did you start it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Five guys? I\u2019m afraid to ask more details, because just looking at his injuries is making my stomach queasy. But I want to know what happened to him. An envelope is resting on the sink. I pick it up and notice money peeking out of the top. Hundred-dollar bills. A bunch of them. I hold out the envelope to Carlos. \u201cIs this yours?\u201d I ask tentatively.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>A million different scenarios about how Carlos got the money start swimming around in my head. None of them are good, but now isn\u2019t the time to drill him about how or why he\u2019s carrying a load of cash. He\u2019s hurt, and I might have to insist on bringing him to the hospital.</p><p>I hold up a finger in front of me. \u201cFollow my finger with your eyes. I want to make sure you don\u2019t have a concussion.\u201d</p><p>I pay close attention to his pupils as he tracks my moving finger. He seems fine, but he\u2019s following my orders without any argument, and that scares me. I\u2019d feel much better if he\u2019d get checked by a professional.</p><p>\u201cTake off your shirt,\u201d I tell him. I search my medicine cabinet for Tylenol.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you want to fool around again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot funny, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. But I\u2019ve got to warn you. If I lift my arm over my head I might pass out. My side is killin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>Knowing his shirt is already ripped and ruined, I pull out scissors from one of the bathroom drawers and cut a line down the front.</p><p>\u201cAfter you\u2019re done, can I return the favor?\u201d he jokes.</p><p>I\u2019m trying to act like we\u2019re just friends, but he keeps throwing me curveballs and it\u2019s confusing me. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I want to numb the pain, and figure that seein\u2019 you naked right about now might help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d I say, shoving Tylenol and a paper cup filled with tap water into his hand.</p><p>\u201cGot anythin\u2019 stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure if you let me take you to the hospital they\u2019ll give you something stronger.\u201d</p><p>Without answering, he throws his head back and swallows the pills. I peel off his cut shirt and try not to gasp again as I examine his injuries. I noticed a few old scars on his body before, but the damage done today to his back and chest is downright nasty.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in fights before,\u201d he says as if that\u2019s supposed to make me feel better.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should avoid them altogether,\u201d I suggest as I gently wipe down his back and chest. \u201cYou\u2019ve got cuts and bruises on your back,\u201d I tell him. The sight of each mark makes me want to cry for him.</p><p>\u201cI know. I can feel every one.\u201d</p><p>When I\u2019m done wiping off all the blood, I step back. He tries to smile, but his lip is so swollen it\u2019s lopsided. \u201cDo I look better?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide this from my parents, you know. One look at you and they\u2019ll be asking questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about that. Not now, at least.\u201d He stands up, grabs his stomach, and growls in pain. \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to bed. Check on me in the mornin\u2019 to see if I\u2019m still alive.\u201d Carlos grabs his T-shirt and envelope before heading to his room, then collapses on the bed. When he looks up and realizes I\u2019ve followed him, he says, \u201cDid I thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2019Cause I meant it and I hardly ever say it.\u201d</p><p>I pull the covers over his aching body. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>I start to walk out of the room, but I hear him start to panic and his breathing gets labored. He reaches out to me. \u201cDon\u2019t go. Please.\u201d</p><p>I sit next to him on the bed, wondering if he\u2019s afraid of being abandoned. He slings his arm around my thigh and rests his forehead against my knee. \u201cI have to protect you,\u201d he says softly.</p><p>\u201cFrom who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEl Diablo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEl Diablo? Who\u2019s that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>What does that mean? \u201cTry to rest,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. My entire body hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I gently rub the arm that\u2019s slung around me until his breathing slows. \u201cI wish I could help you,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he murmurs against my knee. \u201cJust don\u2019t leave me, okay? Everyone leaves me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I can sneak out of his room, I\u2019m going to call Alex and tell him and my dad what happened. I imagine Carlos won\u2019t be thankful then. He\u2019ll likely be downright pissed.</p><p>43</p><p>Carlos</p><p>I\u2019m holding on to Kiara, feeling a desperate need to protect her. If I could only move without feeling like crap, I wouldn\u2019t be lulled to sleep with her fingers stroking my arm. While I welcome sleep, I don\u2019t want Kiara out of my sight. Rodriguez could hurt her, and I can\u2019t let that happen. As long as Kiara is safe, est\u00e1 bien. I need to warn Luis and Mam\u00e1, too. I just need to sleep off this pain . . . for a few minutes. Kiara\u2019s fingers trailing lines up and down my arm is soothing away the sharpness of the pain. I close my eyes. If I fall asleep for a few minutes, it\u2019s okay.</p><p>The sound of the door creaking makes me open my eyes. I suddenly realize that Kiara\u2019s not sitting beside me anymore. Not that I actually expected her to watch over me while I slept. I attempt to sit up, but I\u2019m so damn stiff every bone, muscle, and joint in my body is protesting. Giving up, I stay on my side, under the blanket, hoping it\u2019s Kiara in the room and not her parents . . . or worse, Brandon. If the kid jumps on me, the result might be ugly.</p><p>I close my eyes. \u201cKiara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Damn. I sink my head deeper into the pillow in a weak attempt at hiding the evidence on my face.</p><p>\u201cCarlos, tell me what\u2019s going on. Now,\u201d Westford demands in a clipped and very military-like voice. Usually he\u2019s so easygoing and calm . . . not now, though.</p><p>\u201cI got beat up,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine in a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but please don\u2019t make me prove it right now. Maybe later. Maybe tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Westford pulls off the covers and curses. I didn\u2019t think the guy had it in him.</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d I tell him. I don\u2019t have a shirt on, and he\u2019s seeing the evidence firsthand. I look up at Kiara, standing beside the bed. \u201cYou betrayed me. I told you not to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need help,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d</p><p>Westford crouches down so he\u2019s face-to-face with me. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>I hear more footsteps in the room. \u201cHow is he?\u201d my brother asks.</p><p>\u201cDid you call the entire cavalry, or just half of it?\u201d I ask Kiara. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My brother takes one look at me and shakes his head. He rubs his face, full of frustration and anger and responsibility. It\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s mine. Whether I had a choice or not, I got myself into this and I\u2019ll get myself out. Right now I wish everyone would just leave me alone, because I don\u2019t want to talk about who was involved in the fight and why it happened in the first place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Or at least I will be,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>The Professor, with such a concerned look on his face you\u2019d think the guy was upset about his own son, says to Alex, \u201cHe won\u2019t go to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d Alex tells him.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s insane, Alex. What kind of people don\u2019t go to the hospital when they need medical attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur kind,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like it one bit. We can\u2019t just sit here and do nothing. Look at him, Alex. He\u2019s practically in a fetal position. We\u2019ve got to do something.\u201d I hear Westford pace back and forth on the carpet. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ve got a friend, Charles, who\u2019s a doctor. I can call and see if he\u2019ll come over and take a look at Carlos\u2019s injuries.\u201d Westford kneels down to me. \u201cBut if he says you need to go to the hospital,\u201d he says, shaking his finger at me, \u201cyou\u2019re going, whether or not I have to drag you out of the house kicking and screaming.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of kicking and screaming . . . \u201cWhere\u2019s Brandon?\u201d I ask. I don\u2019t want the kid seeing me until the swelling goes down.</p><p>\u201cAfter Kiara told us what was going on, Colleen took him to her mother\u2019s house. He\u2019ll stay there for a few days.\u201d</p> <p>Their entire life is in chaos because of me. It\u2019s bad enough I\u2019m eating their food and taking up space in their house. Now their kid is banished because I\u2019m a fuckup. \u201cSorry,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Kiara, I\u2019m going to call Charles. Why don\u2019t we give Carlos and his brother some privacy.\u201d Oh, hell. That\u2019s the last thing I want.</p><p>When the door closes, Alex stands over the bed. \u201cYou look like shit, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I look at his bloodshot eyes and wonder if he cried when he found out I was beaten down. I\u2019ve never actually seen Alex cry in person though we\u2019ve been through some tough times. \u201cSo do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Devlin\u2019s guys, huh? Kiara told me you said it was El Diablo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the ones who set me up at school. Last night I got jumped in\u2014 against my will. They said I\u2019m a Devlin now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Even though it hurts to move, I can\u2019t help but let out a short laugh. \u201cTell that to Devlin.\u201d On second thought . . . \u201cI\u2019m kiddin\u2019. Stay the hell away from Devlin. You\u2019re out of all this. Keep it that way. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>I start to get up so I can make sure Alex is listening to me. He\u2019s my brother, my blood. He annoys the hell out of me most of the time, but when it comes right down to it I want to see him graduate from college and have little annoying mini-Alexes and mini-Brittanys running around in the future. This thing with Devlin . . . I just can\u2019t guarantee I can get out of it. I wince and hold my breath as I struggle to sit up, wishing I could suck it up and pretend I\u2019m not in pain. I hate feeling weak and having everyone else watch me struggle.</p><p>Alex coughs a few times, then turns away so he doesn\u2019t have to watch me struggle more. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happenin\u2019 again.\u201d He clears his throat, then turns to me. \u201cWhat did Devlin say? He\u2019s got to want you for some specific reason.\u201d</p><p>The more he knows, the deeper he\u2019ll get into this mess. I can\u2019t allow that to happen. \u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will. I\u2019m not leavin\u2019 here until you tell me everythin\u2019 you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re gonna be here a while. Better make yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Westford knocks and walks back in. \u201cI called my friend Charles. He\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. W. joins us a second later, a tray in her hand. \u201cYou poor dear,\u201d she says, then immediately puts down the tray and rushes over to me. She examines my busted lip and bruises. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want details, Mrs. W.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate fighting. It doesn\u2019t solve anything.\u201d She sets the tray in my lap. \u201cIt\u2019s chicken soup,\u201d she explains. \u201cMy grandmother told me it heals everything.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not hungry, but Mrs. W. is so proud of the chicken soup I take a spoonful just to get her to stop looking at me so anxiously.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she asks.</p><p>Surprisingly, the warm, salty broth with noodles goes down easily. \u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>They\u2019re all watching me like mother hens. I was fine with Kiara but I\u2019m vulnerable right now and I don\u2019t want anyone else around. Well, besides Kiara. Where is she?</p><p>When the doctor arrives, he spends a half hour going over all my injuries. \u201cYou really got yourself in a doozy of a fight, Carlos.\u201d He turns to Westford. \u201cDick, he\u2019s going to be just fine. No concussion, no deep contusions. He\u2019s got badly bruised ribs. I can\u2019t be certain he doesn\u2019t have internal bleeding, but his color is good. Keep him home from school for a couple of days and he should start feeling better. I\u2019ll be back on Wednesday to check on him.\u201d</p><p>After everyone heads downstairs for dinner, Kiara slips back into my room and stands at the edge of the bed, looking down at me. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry I told them what happened to you. You\u2019re not as invincible as you thought. And another thing . . .\u201d She bends down so she\u2019s eye to eye with me. \u201cNow that I know you\u2019re going to be okay, I\u2019ve decided not to have sympathy for you. If you were dealing drugs, you\u2019d better come clean. I know that money in the envelope you stuck in your pillowcase didn\u2019t come from selling my magnet cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked you better when you were sympathetic,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAnd you give yourself too much credit. I couldn\u2019t give your damn cookies away, let alone sell \u2019em. And I\u2019m not sellin\u2019 drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me where you got the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes. \u201cEverything with you is complicated, Carlos. I want to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you don\u2019t have sympathy. Why help me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s selfish, really. I can\u2019t stand watching my fake boyfriend in pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is about you, not me?\u201d I ask her, amused.</p><p>\u201cYeah. And just so you know, you ruined Homecoming for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed the posters around school, it\u2019s next weekend. If you can\u2019t walk, there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll be able to dance by Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>44</p><p>Kiara</p><p>On Wednesday, Carlos insists on going to school. He says he\u2019s feeling better, although I can tell he\u2019s moving slower than usual and is still in pain. He\u2019s got a black eye and his lip is still swollen, but it just makes him look tougher and rougher. Most of the students at Flatiron are staring and pointing as we walk through the halls. Every time Carlos notices someone staring, he drapes his arm around me. Playing the role of his girlfriend isn\u2019t fun when all we\u2019re doing is being stared at. But we\u2019re together, and I feed off his strength in the face of all the gossip.</p><p>At lunch, I\u2019m sitting with Tuck when Carlos walks up to us. \u201cEww,\u201d Tuck says. \u201cMy eyes are almost tearing from looking at your nasty eye. Do us all a favor and wear a mask or something. Or a blindfold.\u201d</p><p>Before I can kick Tuck under the table, Carlos takes the back of Tuck\u2019s chair and tilts it. \u201cBeat it, fucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tucker,\u201d Tuck says, sliding off the chair but doing his best to hold on.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I need to talk to Kiara, alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop fighting, you two,\u201d I tell them. \u201cCarlos, you can\u2019t just order Tuck to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even if I\u2019m going to ask you to Homecoming?\u201d</p><p>I bite my bottom lip. He\u2019s definitely not serious. He can\u2019t be. There\u2019s no way he can take me to Homecoming when just three days ago he was barely able to move. I see him fighting the urge to wince every time he has to bend to get books from his locker or sit in a chair. He told me the doctor said he should move so he doesn\u2019t get stiff, but he\u2019s not superhuman, even though I think he wants to be.</p><p>Tuck motions to the floor. \u201cAre you gonna get on one knee? \u2019Cause everyone is already staring at you guys. I could take a pic on my cell and send it to the yearbook committee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTuck,\u201d I say, looking up at my best friend. \u201cBeat it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll go eat by Jake Somers. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll be inspired by Carlos and gather up the nerve to ask him to Homecoming.\u201d</p><p>Carlos shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I ever thought you were datin\u2019 him.\u201d When Tuck is gone, Carlos pulls up a chair next to me. I notice he holds his breath as he bends to sit down. He\u2019s doing a good job of trying to hide his pain, and I don\u2019t think anyone else notices. But I do. He reaches in his pocket and pulls out a Homecoming ticket. \u201cWill you go to Homecoming with me?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s focused only on me, not caring who may or may not be watching us. I, on the other hand, feel all eyes on me as if they\u2019re darts. \u201cWhy ask now, in the middle of lunch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bought the ticket five minutes ago. Let\u2019s just say I was anxious to make sure you\u2019d still go with me.\u201d</p><p>Ever since he got beat up, he\u2019s been really vulnerable and insecure. It makes me nervous, because I never know if he\u2019s going to end up pushing me away again. I can get used to this Carlos, the one who isn\u2019t afraid to tell me how much he wants to be with me. But it also makes me emotional, and the more emotional I get, the harder it is to control my stuttering. \u201cYou can hardly m-m-move, Carlos. You d-d-don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to do it.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cBesides, I can\u2019t wait to see you in a dress and heels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-w-what are you going to wear?\u201d I ask him. \u201cA suit and tie?\u201d</p><p>He shoves the ticket back in his pocket. \u201cI was thinkin\u2019 more like jeans and a T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>Jeans? T-shirt? Besides being totally inappropriate for the homecoming dance . . . \u201cWe won\u2019t match. I can\u2019t pin a boutonniere on a T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoutonniere? What the hell is that, and why would I want you to pin it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook it up in the dictionary,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cAs long as you\u2019re at it, amigo,\u201d Tuck says as he creeps up behind Carlos, \u201cyou might want to look up the word \u2018corsage.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>45</p><p>Carlos</p><p>cor\u00b7sage (k\u00f4r-s\u00e4zh,-s\u00e4j) n. A small arrangement of flowers worn on the wrist or pinned to the shoulder.</p><p>That\u2019s what the dictionary says. REACH has a small room they call a library with a bunch of self-help books. I got lucky and found a dictionary, and the first thing I did when I got here was open it. I\u2019m sure Kiara would be surprised that I did look it up. So now I\u2019m wondering how I\u2019m gonna find something decent to wear for Homecoming. Equally frustrating is what to do about getting one of these corsages. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Berger starts our little therapy session or whatever politically correct name they\u2019ve come up with to call our group of fuckups this week, Zana and Justin come up to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Justin asks. \u201cGet run over by a truck numerous times?\u201d</p><p>Zana, wearing another skirt so short it might get her sent home from school, bites into one of the brownies set out for us. \u201cRumor has it you got jumped by some gang members fighting for territory.\u201d She says it softly, so Berger can\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both wrong.\u201d I slide into a chair and hope Berger doesn\u2019t grill me about the fight. Hell, I finally got Alex to stop grilling me. I told him to back off, and promised to tell him if Devlin or his guys contact me again.</p> <p>Again, I don\u2019t believe in promises. Why are people such suckers?</p><p>When Keno walks in late, I notice immediately he\u2019s ignoring me. Normally I wouldn\u2019t even notice, but everyone else is staring at me wide-eyed as if my face has been taken over by an alien life-form. Glad they weren\u2019t with me on Sunday. I look a helluva lot better now.</p><p>Berger walks into the room, takes one look at me, and walks back out. Sure enough, after a minute Kinney and Morrisey appear.</p><p>Morrisey points to me. \u201cCarlos, come with us.\u201d</p><p>Both Kinney and Morrisey escort me to a little room off to the side. It\u2019s like a room at a doctor\u2019s office, complete with those needle disposal boxes hangin\u2019 on the wall. There\u2019s one difference, though. A toilet is in the corner, with a small privacy curtain hanging off the ceiling.</p> <p>Morrisey points at my face. \u201cYour guardian called you out on Monday and Tuesday. He said you were in a fight. Wanna tell us about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Kinney steps forward. \u201cOkay, Carlos, here\u2019s the drill. From the look of you, we suspect you\u2019ve been under the influence in the past week. Fights usually go along with drinking and drugs. We\u2019re giving you a urine test. Go wash your hands in the sink over there.\u201d</p><p>I want to roll my eyes and tell them that getting your ass kicked doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a druggie, but instead I just shrug. \u201cWhatever,\u201d I say, after I wash my hands. \u201cJust give me a cup so I can get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you test positive, you\u2019re expelled,\u201d Morrisey says as he opens one of the cabinets and pulls out a urine cup. \u201cYou know the rules.\u201d</p><p>I reach for the cup, but Kinney holds his hand up. \u201cLet me explain what you need to do. You\u2019ll have to strip down to your underwear in our presence, then go behind that curtain and urinate in a cup.\u201d</p> <p>I toss my shirt on one of the chairs, then shrug out of my jeans. I hold my arms out wide and turn around. \u201cHappy now?\u201d I ask them. \u201cI don\u2019t got any contraband on me.\u201d</p><p>Morrisey hands me the cup. \u201cYou have four minutes or less. And don\u2019t flush the toilet, or we\u2019re going to do this all over again.\u201d</p><p>I go behind the curtain with the cup in hand and piss. I\u2019ve got to admit, it\u2019s humiliating having Morrisey and Kinney listening to me piss, although this is just routine for them.</p><p>When I\u2019m done and dressed, I\u2019m instructed to wash again and head back to the group. They won\u2019t have the results until tomorrow, so I\u2019m off the hook until then. When I walk into the room, everyone is staring at me except for Keno. They obviously know the routine and probably figured out I\u2019d just been tested.</p><p>\u201cWelcome back,\u201d Berger says. \u201cYou\u2019ve obviously had a rough week. We missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kind of laid up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to tell us about it? Whatever gets shared in this room, stays in this room. Right, guys?\u201d</p><p>Everyone nods, but I notice Keno mumble under his breath and still avoid eye contact with me. He knows somethin\u2019, and I need to find out what. Problem is getting him alone, \u2019cause after every meeting he books out of here.</p> <p>\u201cLet someone else talk,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dating Kiara Westford,\u201d Zana chimes in. \u201cI saw him with his arm around her in the hallway at school. And my friend Gina saw them at lunch together and heard him ask her to Homecoming.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s the last time I\u2019m doin\u2019 anything in public. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever mind your own business?\u201d I ask Zana. \u201cSeriously, don\u2019t you have any-thin\u2019 better to do than gossip with your stupid friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough. Zana, we don\u2019t talk like that in here. I won\u2019t tolerate profanity. I\u2019m giving you a warning.\u201d Berger takes her pen and writes shit down in her notebook. \u201cCarlos, tell me about Homecoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothin\u2019 to tell. I\u2019m goin\u2019 with a girl, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she someone special?\u201d</p><p>I look over at Keno. If he knows Devlin\u2019s crew, he might give them info. Is Berger that naive to believe what\u2019s said in our little group therapy sessions is actually gonna stay in our group therapy sessions? As soon as we\u2019re out of here, I guarantee Zana is on her cell sharing with her stupid friends every bit of info she can squeeze out of us.</p><p>\u201cKiara and I are . . . complicated,\u201d I tell the group.</p><p>Complicated. That seems to be the theme of my life lately. The rest of the group session is concentrated on Carmela, who complains that her dad is so old-fashioned he\u2019s forbidden her to schedule a trip to California with friends for winter break. Carmela should have parents like the Westfords, who believe everyone should set their own path and make their own mistakes (until you get beat up, then they\u2019re all over you and won\u2019t leave you alone). They\u2019re the opposite of Carmela\u2019s parents.</p><p>When we\u2019re let out of REACH, I follow Keno as he leaves the building. \u201cKeno,\u201d I call to him, but he keeps walking. I curse under my breath, then jog to catch up with him before he gets into his car. \u201cWhat\u2019s your fuckin\u2019 problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t got one. Now get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>I stay between him and his car. \u201cYou work for Devlin, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Keno looks to his right and left, as if he suspects someone\u2019s watchin\u2019 us talk. \u201cGet the hell away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, man. You know somethin\u2019\u2014that means you and me are best friends. I\u2019m gonna ride your ass until you give up any info you have on me or Devlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a pendejo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been called worse, man. Don\u2019t test me.\u201d</p><p>He looks a little nervous. \u201cThen get in the car, before someone sees us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time someone told me to do that, I got my ass kicked by five pendejos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it. Or we\u2019re not talkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I have the urge to jump through the window, but then realize only Kiara\u2019s car has a stuck door. Keno drives out of the lot. Alex is waiting for me at McConnell\u2019s. I have no doubt he\u2019ll end up sending the cavalry if I\u2019m not there, so I call him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d my brother asks.</p><p>\u201cWith a . . . friend.\u201d He\u2019s not really a friend, but there\u2019s no need to send up a red flag. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you later,\u201d I say, then hang up before he can give me any shit.</p><p>Keno doesn\u2019t say anythin\u2019 until he parks at a small apartment complex out of town. \u201cFollow me,\u201d he says, then leads me into the building.</p><p>Inside, he greets his ma and sisters in Spanish. He introduces me, then we head to the back of the apartment. His small bedroom feels oddly familiar. I could probably spot a Mexican teen\u2019s bedroom from a mile away. The creamy white walls have family photos pushpinned to the wall. The Mexican flag attached to the wall and the green, white, and red stickers on the desk gives me a sense of comfort, even though I know I have to be on alert around Keno. I\u2019m just not sure what his game is.</p><p>Keno pulls out a pack of cigarettes. \u201cWant a smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Never was my thing, even though I was brought up by a bunch of smokers. Mi'am\u00e1 smokes, and so did Alex until he started dating the beauty queen. Right about now if he offered me a Vicodin or two I\u2019d probably take it. I\u2019ve pretty much been in bed since Sunday night and my body is still stiff.</p><p>Keno shrugs and lights up. \u201cMorrisey gave you a drug test today, huh?\u201d</p><p>I guess we\u2019re gonna bullshit around before we get to the real reason he brought me here. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink you\u2019ll pass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried.\u201d I lean on the window ledge and watch as Keno sits in his desk chair and blows out smoke. The guy doesn\u2019t look like he has a care in the world, and right about now I\u2019m jealous.</p><p>\u201cBerger just about had a coronary when she saw you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can speak in Spanish to me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, if I speak Spanish my ma will know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. It\u2019s better when she\u2019s clueless.\u201d</p><p>I nod. It\u2019s always better when parents are clueless. Unfortunately, I had to call my uncle Julio yesterday and give him a heads-up on what\u2019s been goin\u2019 on. He promised he would make sure Luis and mi'am\u00e1 had protection, and would try not to alarm them unnecessarily. He wasn\u2019t too happy with me for gettin\u2019 messed up with Devlin, but he pretty much expects me to be a fuckup, so he wasn\u2019t surprised.</p><p>Makes me want to prove I\u2019m not totally useless, but that\u2019s not likely to happen. Being a fuckup is what I\u2019ve done best my entire life. It\u2019s comforting to know that Kiara and her parents believe everyone can wipe the slate clean at any point.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re datin\u2019 that Kiara chick, huh?\u201d He blows out smoke. \u201cIs she hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmokin\u2019,\u201d I say, knowing that Keno has no clue who she is since he doesn\u2019t go to Flatiron. Thoughts of Kiara in her DON\u2019T BE A WIENER, CLIMB A 14\u2019ER shirt run through my head. I\u2019ve got to admit, Kiara\u2019s not the type I\u2019m usually attracted to, and I\u2019m certain Keno wouldn\u2019t be attracted to her, but lately I can\u2019t think of anything sexier than a girl who knows how to solder wires together and bake stupid-ass cookie magnets. I need to stop thinkin\u2019 about her so much, but I don\u2019t want to. Not yet. Maybe after Homecoming. Besides, I have to keep her close to protect her from Rodriguez and Devlin\u2019s guys.</p><p>Speaking of Devlin . . . \u201cNo more fuckin\u2019 around, Keno. Tell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re part of the Devlin crew. It\u2019s all around\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll around where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Six Point Renegados, otherwise known as R6.\u201d He pulls up his shirt and shows off a black six-point star with a big blue R in the middle of it. \u201cYou\u2019re in deep shit, ese. Devlin is crazy, and the R6 don\u2019t like him closin\u2019 in on our territory. The R6 controlled things around here until Devlin messed it all up. A war is about to go down, and Devlin is recruitin\u2019 guys who know how to fight. All he\u2019s got now is a bunch of loser kids as bag boys who smoke \u2019bout as much as they sell. He needs warriors. Carlos, one look at you and anyone can see you\u2019re a warrior, a guerrero.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe told me he wanted me to be his bag boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t believe it.

If he wants a soldier to fight a street battle, he\u2019s got you in his back pocket.\u201d</p><p>Keno is watching me, gauging my reaction to that news. Thing is, I pretty much knew it all along except for the R6 info. Great, I\u2019ve been recruited for a drug war that has nothing to do with anything except money.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d I ask him. \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for you?\u201d</p> <p>Keno leans forward, takes a drag, and blows smoke out in one long stream. He looks up at me, all serious. \u201cI\u2019m gettin\u2019 out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. Out. Like disappearin\u2019, where nobody can find me. I\u2019m sick of the same ol\u2019 mierda, Carlos. Hell, maybe the REACH bullshit is sinkin\u2019 in. Every time Berger says we\u2019re in charge of our futures, I think lady, you\u2019ve got no clue. But what if I did have control over my future, Carlos? What if I left and started over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did what?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cWhatever I want, man. Shit, maybe I could get a job and somehow, someday, get my GED and go to college. Maybe get married and have a couple of kids who don\u2019t remember their dad bein\u2019 a gangbanger. I\u2019ve always wanted to be a judge. You know, change the system and make it work so teens wouldn\u2019t end up stuck like me. I wrote it down on Kinney\u2019s REACH goal sheet. You probably think it\u2019s a stupid goal to be a judge after I got arrested for drug possession\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid,\u201d I say, interrupting him. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He waves the smoke away, and for the first time I sense his anticipation and fear wrapped together in one. \u201cWanna come with? I\u2019m leavin\u2019 at the end of the month, on Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s three weeks away.\u201d Leaving Colorado would mean ditching Devlin and givin\u2019 my brother and the Westfords their normal lives back. They wouldn\u2019t have to deal with me or my bullshit. And Kiara could get on with her life, a life that was going to be without me anyway. Soon she\u2019ll realize the reality\u2014 I\u2019ve got less than nothing to offer her. The last thing I need is to watch her date other guys. If she gets back with Michael I\u2019ll go nuts. I\u2019d be delusional to think this thing we have could be permanent.</p><p>I nod to Keno. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I have to leave. But I\u2019ve got to go back to Mexico first and make sure my family is safe. After I leave here, they\u2019re the only thing I have left.\u201d</p><p>46</p><p>Kiara</p> <p>When I told my mom I was going to the homecoming dance with Carlos, she wasn\u2019t surprised. She said she\u2019d take me to the mall to find a dress on Friday. It took me a while, but I finally found a long, black satin sleeveless dress at a vintage store. It hugs every curve in my body. It\u2019s totally out of my comfort zone to wear something so tight and with a huge slit down the side, but when I put it on it makes me feel pretty and confident. It reminds me of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.</p><p>When I brought home the dress, I quickly snuck up to my room and hung it in my closet. I don\u2019t want Carlos to see it until I put it on for the dance.</p><p>Saturday morning the entire family, including Carlos, gets up and goes to the football game. Flatiron wins 21\u201313, so everyone is pumped and excited. After the game, Carlos says he has stuff to do before the dance. I go with my mom to buy shoes.</p><p>She picks up a pair of black flats with little buckles on the sides. \u201cHow about these? They look comfy.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not looking for comfy.\u201d</p><p>I walk around the store, making sure to pass up any heels that Carlos would consider \u201cgranny\u201d width. I set my sights on black satin pumps with a three-and-a-half-inch skinny heel and a vintage-looking ankle clasp. They\u2019re perfect. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to walk in them, but they\u2019ll match my dress and look good. \u201cHow about these?\u201d I ask my mom.</p><p>Her eyes go wide. \u201cYou sure? They\u2019ll make you taller than your father.\u201d</p><p>My mom doesn\u2019t own a pair of pumps with two-inch heels, let alone any that are over three inches.</p> <p>\u201cI love them,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cThen try them on. It\u2019s for your special day.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later I walk out with the shoes, excited to have found the perfect pair to go with the perfect dress. I want tonight to be perfect, too. I hope Carlos isn\u2019t feeling pressured, even though I pretty much coerced him into asking me. Hopefully we can have fun and forget what happened last weekend. I don\u2019t expect us to do much dancing since he\u2019s still healing, but that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be happy just being there with him, whether or not we\u2019re a real couple.</p><p>\u201cWe have to pick up the boutonniere,\u201d my mom says as we get in the car.</p><p>\u201cI already picked it up this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ve got my camera ready. Dad\u2019s got the camcorder charging . . . we\u2019re all set. We\u2019ll send the pictures to Carlos\u2019s mother on Monday, so she doesn\u2019t feel like she missed out.\u201d</p><p>After we get home, I stay in my room with the door closed, practicing how to walk in my new shoes. I feel like I\u2019m lurching forward every time I take a step. It takes me an hour before I get the hang of it. Tuck comes over and makes me more nervous when he brings me a box full of gifts for the evening.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d Tuck says, handing me the box.</p><p>I lift open the top and peek inside. I pull out a black lace garter. \u201cYou don\u2019t wear a garter for Homecoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one is specially made for Homecoming. Look, it\u2019s got a little fake-gold football charm hanging off it.\u201d I toss it on my bed, then pull out the next item. Rose-tinted lip gloss.</p><p>Tuck shrugs as I open it. \u201cPersonally it grosses me out, but I hear straight guys like it when girls have shiny lips. There\u2019s some eyeliner and mascara in there, too. The lady at the store said they\u2019re the best ones to get.\u201d</p><p>While I\u2019m taking out each item, I stop and look at Tuck. \u201cWhy did you buy me all this stuff ?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cI just . . . didn\u2019t want you to miss out. Whether you want to admit it to me or not, you like him. I know I give the guy a hard time, but maybe you see something in him the rest of us don\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>Tuck is the most awesome best friend. \u201cYou\u2019re so sweet,\u201d I say, just as I\u2019m emptying out the box of breath mints and . . . two condoms. I hold them up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t buy me condoms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t. I took them from the health-service office at school. They just hand \u2019em out if you want one . . . or two. You might want to ask him if he\u2019s allergic to latex, though. If he is, you\u2019re SOL.\u201d</p><p>I think about having sex with Carlos and my face feels hot. \u201cI\u2019m not planning on having sex tonight.\u201d I toss the square packages on the bed, but Tuck picks them back up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you need the condoms, stupid. If you\u2019re not planning on it and it happens, you won\u2019t be prepared and then you\u2019ll end up pregnant or diseased. Do me a favor and stick \u2019em in your purse or shove \u2019em inside your Spanx.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my arms around Tuck and kiss him on the cheek. \u201cI love you for caring about me so much. I\u2019m sorry Jake said no when you asked him to Homecoming.\u201d</p><p>Tuck laughs. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you the latest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the latest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake called about an hour ago. He doesn\u2019t want to go to Homecoming . . . but he wants to hang out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. I thought he was straight, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? For someone who\u2019s best friends with a homo, you\u2019ve got no gaydar. Jake Somers is as gay as I am, no question about it. I\u2019ve got to be honest, Kiara. I\u2019m so nervous and anxious and excited I hope I don\u2019t screw this up. I\u2019ve secretly liked Jake for a while now.\u201d Tuck walks over to my desk drawer and takes out the Rules of Attraction notebook. He tears out each page and rips it into little pieces.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you d-d-doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRipping up my Rules of Attraction. I\u2019ve figured something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Tuck tosses the ripped paper in my garbage. \u201cThere are no rules to attraction. Jake is nothing like who I wanted. He doesn\u2019t have the same interests I have, he hates Ultimate, and he reads and analyzes poetry in his spare time just for fun. I can\u2019t stop thinking about him. He said he wants to hang out tonight. What does hanging out mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure that one out myself.\u201d I reach for one of the condom packages and toss it to him. \u201cYou better take one, just in case.\u201d</p><p>47</p><p>Carlos</p><p>\u201cI told you one day you\u2019d call me,\u201d Brittany says as we walk through the mall.</p><p>I called her yesterday and asked her to meet me after the Flatiron football game today. I need her help, because she\u2019s the only one I know who\u2019s hoity-toity enough to be an expert on all this Homecoming crap.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t brag about it,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Alex didn\u2019t insist on comin\u2019 with us. You two are joined at the hip.\u201d</p><p>She keeps her concentration on the racks of suits, picking out some for me to try on. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not, did you two have a fight?\u201d I joke, not believin\u2019 for a minute my brother would argue with his girlfriend.</p><p>Brittany blinks a couple of times, as if holding back tears. \u201cActually, we broke up yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dead serious, and I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Go try on those suits before I start bawling in the middle of the store. It won\u2019t be pretty.\u201d She shoves the suits at me and shoos me off to the dressing room. When I look back, she\u2019s taken a tissue out of her purse and is wiping her eyes with it.</p><p>What the hell? No wonder my brother hasn\u2019t wanted to talk to me much and hasn\u2019t drilled me about Devlin since Sunday night. What did he do to screw things up with Brittany, the girl he said was responsible for changing his life?</p><p>Thanks to Devlin\u2019s envelope full of cash, I buy the suit Brittany says makes me look like a GQ model. Then we pick up the corsage I ordered yesterday when I found a florist who would create one for Kiara on short notice. When we\u2019re back in the car, I figure it\u2019s safe to ask Brittany about the supposed breakup. If she cries now, nobody will see she\u2019s got mascara runnin\u2019 down her face.</p><p>I can\u2019t hold it in any longer. My curiosity is killin\u2019 me. \u201cYou and my brother are sickeningly perfect together, so what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t happen to be with him right now, I\u2019m with you. Unless you want me to call him . . .\u201d I pull out the cell from my pocket.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she cries. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare call him. I don\u2019t want to see him, hear him, or have anything to do with him right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, crap, this is serious. She\u2019s not foolin\u2019 around, so I better think of something quick. \u201cDrive me to the body shop. I\u2019m borrowin\u2019 Alex\u2019s new car tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can use my car,\u201d she says, not batting an eye.</p><p>Oh, hell. I\u2019ve got to come up with an excuse as to why I need my brother\u2019s new car instead of a hot Beemer convertible. \u201cKiara likes vintage cars. She\u2019ll be disappointed if I come in a Beemer when she\u2019s expectin\u2019 a Monte Carlo. She\u2019s not normal, you know. And she gets upset easily. I wouldn\u2019t want to make her cry and stutter on Homecoming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to feed me more bullshit until I drop you at McConnell\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>At a stoplight, Brittany sighs and takes a deep breath. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll take you. But don\u2019t expect me to get out of the car or talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I\u2019m takin\u2019 his car, he\u2019ll need a ride home. Can you take him, so I can get ready for the dance?\u201d My brother and Brittany together make me nauseous, but the thought of them apart and miserable is just . . . no est\u00e1 bien, not good. I give them a hard time, but deep down I envy their relationship. When they\u2019re together, the world could fall apart around them and they\u2019d never notice or care as long as they have each other.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push it, Carlos,\u201d Brittany says. \u201cI\u2019m dropping you off, then leaving. But I\u2019ll give you a piece of advice for tonight, and then I\u2019ll shut up. Rein in your attitude and ego tonight and treat Kiara like you would a princess. Make her feel special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ve got a big ego and an attitude problem?\u201d I ask her.</p> <p>She lets out a short laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think you do, Carlos. I know it. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a Fuentes flaw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d call it an asset. It\u2019s what makes us Fuentes brothers irresistible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s what ruins your relationships. If you want Kiara to have great memories of tonight, just remember what I said and rein it in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you that Alex loves you so much he got your name tattooed all over his body? Hell, he even got your name branded into the back of his neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say \u2018LB,\u2019 Carlos. The initials for Latino Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no. You\u2019ve got it all wrong. He wants everyone to think that, but in reality it means Lover of Brittany. LB, get it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice try, Carlos. Totally not true, but a nice try nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>True to her word, Brittany drops me off at the shop and speeds away. Her tires screech on the parking lot, something I\u2019m sure my brother taught her to do. It\u2019s just more proof they should be together.</p><p>In the shop, my brother has his head under the hood of a Cadillac. I wonder if he\u2019s oblivious that his recent ex-girlfriend/love of his life just sped away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d Alex asks me as he wipes his hands on a shop cloth. \u201cI thought you were half dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how far away half dead is from fully dead, Alex. Actually I feel like shit, but am doin\u2019 a helluva good job fakin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I notice he\u2019s got a black bandanna on, something I haven\u2019t seen him wear since he was in the Latino Blood. It\u2019s not a good sign. He looks like a rebel, too much like me. I know firsthand when you take the time to look like a rebel, actin\u2019 like one isn\u2019t far behind. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch of work to do, and you\u2019ve got a dance to get to, so if you don\u2019t mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you break up with Brittany?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what she told you?\u201d Alex says, his eyebrows crinkling in frustration and anger. Man, he\u2019s pissed right now. From the ragged look of him, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s slept well lately.</p> <p>\u201cKeep your pants on, bro,\u201d I tell him. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anythin\u2019. She told me to ask you what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe broke up. You were right, Carlos. Brit and I are too different. We come from different worlds and it was never gonna work out.\u201d</p><p>When he ducks his head under the hood again, I pull him back. \u201cUsted es estupido.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou callin\u2019 me stupid? I\u2019m not the one who unintentionally got jumped in to a gang last Sunday.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cTalk about stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Alex. You tell me why you and the beauty queen broke up, and I\u2019ll tell you everythin\u2019 I know \u2019bout Devlin.\u201d</p><p>Alex sighs, the action deflating his anger a bit. I know he wants to protect me and our family above all else. He knows next week I\u2019m gonna be called to action by Devlin. He can\u2019t resist being involved in trying to help get me out of this.</p><p>\u201cHer parents are comin\u2019 to town to visit her sister Shelley in two weeks,\u201d Alex says. \u201cShe wants to tell them we\u2019ve been secretly dating seriously since we started college. They know how it ended between us back in Chicago. I was a total asshole to her, then I left.\u201d He presses his palms to his eyes and moans. \u201cLook at me, Carlos. I\u2019m still the same guy they wouldn\u2019t let her date back in Chicago. They think I\u2019m the scum of the earth, and they\u2019re probably right. Brittany wants me to fuckin\u2019 go to dinner with them, as if they\u2019ll just accept that the girl they groomed to be a princess ended up with the guy they\u2019ll always see as the poor, dirty Mexican from the slums.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t believe it. My own brother, the one who bravely fought his own gang and wasn\u2019t afraid to get shot for it, is shittin\u2019 in his pants at the prospect of standing up for himself and their relationship in front of Brittany\u2019s parents. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cAm not. I just don\u2019t need the bullshit.\u201d</p><p>The bullshit is that my brother is scared. He\u2019s afraid of Brittany agreeing with her parents once and for all and dumping his ass. Alex can\u2019t take her rejection, so he\u2019s pushing her away and rejecting her before she can do it to him. I know, because that\u2019s the story of my own life.</p><p>\u201cBrittany wants to stick up for your relationship,\u201d I say as I eye Alex\u2019s vintage Monte Carlo at the corner of the shop. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you? Because you\u2019re a coward, bro. Have a little faith in your novia. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll risk losin\u2019 her for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer parents will never think I\u2019m good enough for her. I\u2019ll always feel like the lower-class pendejo who took advantage of their daughter.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m lucky Kiara\u2019s parents are the opposite. They\u2019re content when their kids are happy, no matter what. They try and influence us, but they don\u2019t judge anyone. At first I thought it was an act, that nobody could just accept me even when I try to push them away. I think the Westfords really do accept people for who they are, flaws and all.</p><p>\u201cIf you think you\u2019re the lower-class pendejo, then you are. Problem is, Brittany doesn\u2019t see different social classes or think of your bank account when she\u2019s with you. It\u2019s kind of sickenin\u2019, but she actually loves you no matter what. Maybe you guys should break up, \u2019cause she deserves a dude who\u2019ll stick up for his relationship at all costs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Alex says. \u201cYou don\u2019t know crap about relationships. Since when have you even had one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in one now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fake. Even Kiara admitted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s better than what you\u2019ve got, which is nothin\u2019.\u201d I walk over to the blue Monte Carlo. \u201cJust so you know, I was hopin\u2019 to borrow your car tonight. Not for me, but for Kiara. I know you think she\u2019s cool, and I can\u2019t very well use her car to take her on an official date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was plannin\u2019 on headin\u2019 over to the Westfords\u2019 before the dance. They invited me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave yourself the trouble,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cFine. But bring it back after the dance, \u2019cause I was plannin\u2019 on workin\u2019 on it tomorrow.\u201d After I toss the suit and corsage in the backseat, Alex says, \u201cI thought you hated me and Brittany together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just like to give you shit, Alex. That\u2019s what younger brothers are for, aren\u2019t they?\u201d I shrug. \u201cShe might not be a chica Mexicana, but she\u2019s the best your ass is ever gonna get. Might as well seal the deal and marry the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what, half a degree and a vintage car to offer?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cIf that\u2019s all you got, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll take it. Hell, it\u2019s a helluva lot more than I got, and more than our parents had when they got married. Even worse, \u2019cause mi'am\u00e1 was pregnant with your ugly ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeakin\u2019 of ugly, have you looked in the mirror lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s funny, Alex. Even with a busted lip and black eye, I\u2019m still better lookin\u2019 than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Wait,\u201d Alex says. \u201cYou still never told me about Devlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I start the car and rev the engine. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you tomorrow. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>When I get to the Westfords\u2019, Brandon is in my room sitting on my bed with his his arms crossed. The kid is doing his best to put on a mean face that might actually intimidate someone in ten or so years.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, cachorro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mad at you.\u201d</p><p>Man, I\u2019m gettin\u2019 heat from all sides today. \u201cTake a number and get in line, kid.\u201d</p><p>He huffs like a car with a bad exhaust. \u201cYou said we were partners in crime. That if I did something, you wouldn\u2019t tattle. And if you did something, I wouldn\u2019t tattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a tattletale. Now Daddy won\u2019t let me play games on the computer unless he\u2019s watching, like I\u2019m a baby. It\u2019s all your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Life isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>If life was fair, my father wouldn\u2019t have died when I was four. If life was fair, I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about Devlin. If life was fair, I\u2019d have a real chance with Kiara. Life pretty much sucks. \u201cDon\u2019t know. But if you figure it out, cachorro, let me know.\u201d</p><p>I expect him to throw a fit, but he doesn\u2019t. He jumps off my bed and heads for the door. \u201cI\u2019m still mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it. Now beat it. I\u2019ve got to take a shower and get ready. I\u2019m runnin\u2019 late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get over it faster and leave you alone if you can sneak me some candy from the cabinet above the refrigerator. It\u2019s my mom\u2019s secret hiding place.\u201d He motions for me to bend down so he can tell me a secret. \u201cShe keeps unhealthy snacks in it,\u201d he whispers. \u201cYou know, the good kind.\u201d The more he talks about it, the more excited he gets.</p><p>Damn. I have less than an hour before I have to be Kiara\u2019s date, but I don\u2019t want to let the kid down. \u201cAll right, Racer. You ready to go on a secret mission to find the treasure?\u201d</p><p>Brandon rubs his hands together, obviously pleased with himself for manipulating me. The kid does have talent in the persuasion department, I\u2019ll give him that much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d I peek my head out the door, then wave him over. I hide a laugh as he tiptoes toward me. Sometimes this kid acts like a six-year-old, and sometimes he acts like someone who has more sense than some adults I know.</p><p>We step down the stairs in silence. Before we reach the kitchen, someone walks out of Westford\u2019s office. It\u2019s Kiara, wearing a long black dress that hugs her delicious curves from her chest to her thighs. Her hair is not only flowing down the front of her chest, the ends have been carefully and perfectly curled. One of her long, lean legs peeks out from the insanely sexy slit on the side.</p><p>I\u2019m stunned.</p><p>I\u2019m speechless.</p> <p>My eyes roam over her, enjoying the view. I know I\u2019ll remember this moment for the rest of my life. When I look down at her sexy open-toe pumps with a higher heel than I ever imagined her wearing, my heart skips a beat. I\u2019m afraid to blink for fear she\u2019s a figment of my imagination and will disappear.</p><p>\u201cW-w-well, w-w-what d-d-do you think?\u201d</p><p>Brandon gives her a loud, \u201cShh,\u201d and puts a finger over his mouth. \u201cWe\u2019re on a secret mission,\u201d he whispers loudly, oblivious that his sister has transformed into a goddess. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Mom or Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she whispers. \u201cWhat are you on a mission for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCandy. The unhealthy kind. Come on!\u201d</p> <p>I look back at Kiara, wishing we were alone right now. Really wishing we were alone right now. \u201cBrandon, go check where your dad is so we know the coast is clear,\u201d I tell him. I need a few minutes alone with his sister.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, slithering out of the hall. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve got less than a minute alone with her. I shove my hands in my pockets, to prevent me from showing my nervous, shaking hands. She rewards me with a half smile, then looks at the ground.</p><p>I look up at the ceiling, wishing I could get some advice, or at least a sign from my dad. I take another look at Kiara. Oh, man. She\u2019s staring right at me now, waiting for me to say something. Before I can come up with a meaningful or funny remark, Brandon comes back. \u201cHe\u2019s in his den. Let\u2019s do it before he catches us.\u201d</p><p>I choked. I\u2019ve got to get Brandon out of here. We all head for the kitchen. I reach up and open the small cabinet door above the refrigerator. Sure enough, there\u2019s a big basket filled with contraband.</p><p>Brandon tugs on the bottom of my shirt. \u201cShow me, show me.\u201d</p> <p>I put the basket on the table. Brandon steps on a kitchen chair and checks out the loot. \u201cHere,\u201d he says, shoving a chocolate bar in my hand. \u201cThey have nuts. I don\u2019t like nuts.\u201d</p><p>In the end, Brandon swipes one milk chocolate bar and two pieces of licorice. Satisfied with his treasure, he hops off the chair.</p><p>I put the basket back in the secret hiding place that everyone knows about. When I turn back around, Brandon is already breaking off a piece of chocolate and shoving it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cKiara, why do you look like a girl?\u201d Brandon asks with a mouthful of chocolate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going on a date. With Carlos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna French-kiss him?\u201d</p><p>Kiara gives him a scolding look. \u201cBrandon! That\u2019s totally not an appropriate thing to ask. Who told you about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fourth graders on the bus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did the fourth graders say it was?\u201d</p><p>He gives her an exasperated look. \u201cYou know . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I have firsthand knowledge that she does know what French kissing is, but I\u2019m not giving her secret away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s when you lick the other person\u2019s tongue,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Damn, the kid knows more than I did at his age. First he\u2019s a cyber drug dealer, now he\u2019s talking about French kissing. Kiara looks to me, but I hold my hands up. While I\u2019d like nothing better than to French-kiss her right now, I can wait until later. \u201cHe\u2019s not my kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can get a lot of germs that way,\u201d he says as he munches away and contemplates the consequences of French kissing.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Kiara agrees. \u201cRight, Carlos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Germs. Lots of \u2019em.\u201d I don\u2019t tell him that some girls\u2019 germs are worth getting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna do it,\u201d he declares.</p><p>\u201cNobody\u2019s ever gonna want to do it with you, cachorro, if you don\u2019t wipe your mouth after you eat chocolate. You\u2019re disgustin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>As Kiara reaches for a napkin and wipes Brandon\u2019s face, he looks up at her curiously. \u201cYou never answered my question. Are you and Carlos going to French-kiss?\u201d</p><p>48</p><p>Kiara</p><p>\u201cBrandon, stop asking that or I\u2019m telling Mom you just snuck chocolate without her permission.\u201d I lean over and kiss his now-clean cheek. \u201cBut I still love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeanie,\u201d Brandon says, but I know he isn\u2019t upset, because he bounces out of the kitchen with a spring in his step.</p><p>We\u2019re alone at last. Carlos comes up from behind me and gently swipes my hair to the side, exposing my neck. \u201cEres hermosa,\u201d he whispers into my ear. Just the sound of the Spanish words makes my insides feel like Jell-O.</p><p>I twirl around and face him. \u201cThanks. I needed to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go take a shower and get dressed, but I don\u2019t want to stop lookin\u2019 at you.\u201d</p><p>I push him away from me, even though I\u2019m actually giddy because he can\u2019t stop staring. \u201cGo. I\u2019m not missing my first high school dance.\u201d</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, I\u2019m still standing in heels afraid to sit down and wrinkle my dress. My mom insisted on painting my fingernails pink, so I resist picking at them even though I can\u2019t help fidgeting. We\u2019re in the backyard, where my mom and dad are snapping picture after picture of me standing next to the house, next to a potted plant, next to my car, with Brandon, and the fence and . . .</p><p>Carlos opens the sliding glass door and steps onto the patio. A black suit and white button-down shirt have replaced his ever-present T-shirt and ripped jeans. Just looking at him all dressed up for me makes my heart beat faster and my tongue feel thick and heavy. Especially when I see him holding a corsage in his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, you look so handsome. You\u2019re sweet to take Kiara to Homecoming,\u201d my mom says. \u201cShe\u2019s always wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>I don\u2019t interrupt and tell my mom that he asked me because we shook on it. I\u2019m pretty sure if we hadn\u2019t made a deal we wouldn\u2019t be standing here in the nicest clothes we own.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Carlos says, holding out the corsage full of purple-and-white flowers with yellow centers.</p><p>\u201cPut it on her, Carlos,\u201d my mom says excitedly as she holds up her camera.</p><p>My dad makes my mom put the camera down. \u201cColleen, let\u2019s go inside. I think we should give them a few minutes alone.\u201d</p><p>When my parents give us privacy, Carlos slips the corsage on my wrist. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t match your dress,\u201d he says shyly. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not roses like I\u2019m sure you were expectin\u2019. They\u2019re Mexican asters. Every time you look at it tonight, I wanted it to remind you of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re p-p-perfect,\u201d I say, bringing the purple and white flowers to my nose so I can breathe in their sweet scent.</p><p>On the patio table is the boutonniere I bought him. It\u2019s a simple white rose with green leaves. I pick it up and hold it out to him. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to p-p-pin it to your lapel.\u201d</p><p>He moves closer. My hands are shaking as I take the big pin and try to put it on right. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll just do it,\u201d he says as he watches me struggle to push the pin through the green florist tape on the bottom of the boutonniere. Our fingers touch and I can hardly breathe.</p><p>After we suffer through a few pictures with my parents, clouds start forming overhead. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to rain tonight,\u201d my mom says, then orders me to bring my taupe raincoat that doesn\u2019t match my dress but repels water. Carlos seems excited to drive me in Alex\u2019s car. He knew I\u2019d think it was cool that we have matching cars.</p><p>We drive up to the school parking lot ten minutes later, which is packed. But before we get to the doors, out of nowhere Nick Glass and two other big guys block our path. It\u2019s obvious they\u2019re not here to dance . . . they\u2019re here to cause trouble.</p><p>I grab on to Carlos\u2019s arm, scared that he\u2019ll get into another fight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he assures me softly. \u201cTrust me, chica.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my territory,\u201d Nick says, stepping closer. \u201cI\u2019m not sharin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d Carlos tells him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem here?\u201d Ram says, walking up to us with a girl who I don\u2019t recognize. Ram and Carlos have become friends in school, and it\u2019s nice to know someone is willing to stick his neck out for Carlos even though it\u2019s Homecoming.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re cool, right, Nick?\u201d Carlos asks.</p><p>Nick looks from Carlos to Ram and back. Nick\u2019s friends aren\u2019t from Flatiron High. They look like guys who aren\u2019t afraid to fight, but in the end Nick steps back and lets us through.</p><p>Carlos grabs my hand and pushes past them without fear.</p><p>\u201cIf you need me, Carlos, I\u2019m here,\u201d Ram tells him as we reach the front door to the school.</p><p>\u201cSame to you, man,\u201d Carlos responds, then squeezes my hand. \u201cIf you want to go somewhere else, Kiara, I\u2019m totally game.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cA deal\u2019s a deal. I want the photographer to take a picture, so I can pin it to my corkboard over my desk as a reminder of my first school dance. Just promise me, no fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, chica. But after the picture, if you want to go somewhere else, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere would we go?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>He looks around at the streamers and the posters and the students yelling and dancing to the loud music. He pulls me closer. \u201cSomewhere quiet, where we can be alone. I don\u2019t really feel like sharin\u2019 you tonight.\u201d</p><p>The thing is, I don\u2019t feel like sharing him, either.</p><p>The photographer has us pose for pictures before we enter the gymnasium. Actually, he poses us, treating us like mannequins in a department store.</p><p>\u201cWant a drink?\u201d Carlos asks, his arm around my waist pulling me close so I can hear him over the loud, pounding music.</p><p>I shake my head, taking in the scene. Most of the girls are wearing really short dresses with frilly skirts that fly up when they twirl and dance. I look out of place in my long, black, form-fitting vintage dress.</p><p>\u201cFood?\u201d he asks. \u201cThere\u2019s pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I watch the other students dancing. Most of them are dancing in groups, jumping up and down to the loud music. Madison isn\u2019t here. Lacey isn\u2019t, either. Knowing that I won\u2019t be the subject of their rude remarks tonight makes me let down my guard.</p><p>He grabs my hand and leads me to the far corner of the gymnasium. \u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not one hundred percent yet. Let\u2019s wait until there\u2019s a slow dance. I don\u2019t want you to hurt yourself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not listening to me, Carlos starts dancing. He doesn\u2019t act like he\u2019s in pain. In fact, he acts like he\u2019s been street dancing his entire life. The blaring music has a fast beat. Most guys I know don\u2019t have rhythm, but Carlos does. He\u2019s amazing. I want to step back and just watch him move his body to the beat.</p><p>\u201cShow me what you got,\u201d he says at one point. He\u2019s got a mischievous gleam in his eye as he cocks an eyebrow. \u201cI dare you, chica.\u201d</p><p>49</p><p>Carlos</p> <p>Kiara can dance like a pro. Man, one little dare and the girl moves to the music as if she owns it. I dance with her, our movements suddenly coming together. We\u2019re finding our own rhythm together, dancing to each song without stopping. Kiara takes me away from thoughts of Devlin and the Brittany/Alex drama that\u2019s going on.</p><p>Right in the middle of a fast song, the DJ mixes it up. A painfully slow song about love and loss echoes through the gymnasium. Kiara looks at me, unsure of how we\u2019re gonna do this.</p><p>I take her hands and wrap them around my neck. Damn, she smells great . . . like fresh raspberries you can inhale forever. When I pull her so her body is pressed up against mine, all I want to do is steal her away and never give her back. I\u2019m trying to pretend Devlin doesn\u2019t exist and that I\u2019m not leaving her for good at the end of the month. I want to savor today, \u2019cause my future is one big mess right now.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>\u201cLeavin\u2019 here,\u201d I say, telling her the truth. She doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m actually talking about leaving Colorado, but that\u2019s okay. If she knew what my plans were, she\u2019d probably call Alex and her parents and arrange an intervention. Hell, she\u2019d probably invite Tuck, too, while she was at it.</p> <p>With her arms still wrapped around my neck, she looks up at me. I lean down and kiss her gently on her soft, shiny lips, not caring that the teachers are watching. The entire student body has been warned about the possibility of being kicked out of the dance for PDA.</p><p>\u201cWe c-c-can\u2019t kiss,\u201d Kiara says, leaning away.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go somewhere where we can.\u201d My hand slides down her back and rests on the curve right above her ass.</p><p>\u201cHey, Carlos!\u201d Ram yells as he and his date walk up to us after we\u2019ve danced and eaten and are ready to bounce. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna head out and hang at my parents\u2019 lake house. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>I look over at my date. She nods.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s raining, so we hurry to the car. I follow Ram and a few other cars out of the parking lot. A half hour later we all turn off the main road and head up a long driveway to a small house on a private lake.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay with us bein\u2019 here?\u201d I ask her. She hasn\u2019t said much since we left the dance.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I d-d-don\u2019t want the night to be over.\u201d</p><p>Me either. After tonight, reality will start to set in. We follow three other couples inside the house, running because now it\u2019s pouring. It\u2019s not a big house, but it\u2019s got huge windows with lake views. I\u2019m sure if it wasn\u2019t dark outside we\u2019d actually be able to see the lake. Now all we see is the rain pelting the windows.</p><p>Ram has the refrigerator stocked with cans of beer. \u201cIt\u2019s all ours,\u201d Ram says as he tosses one to each person. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more in the garage, if we want it.\u201d</p><p>Kiara is holding the can of beer Ram tossed her. It\u2019s still unopened. \u201cAre you going to drink?\u201d she asks me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>She holds out her hand. \u201cThen give me the keys. I don\u2019t want you driving if you\u2019re drinking,\u201d she says softly so the other couples can\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d Ram yells out, \u201ceveryone who drinks here needs to crash here. House rules.\u201d</p><p>I look around. It seems as if the other couples are ready to shack up. \u201cWait here,\u201d I tell Kiara, then run outside to the car and pull out the cell that I stashed on the dash. Five minutes later, I come back in the house. Despite her self-proclaimed shyness, Kiara is doing just fine. Ram has her talking about the benefits of diesel fuel and I\u2019m tempted to say, \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d But she\u2019s not really my girl. At least, she won\u2019t be soon. Tonight she is, though.</p><p>I pull Kiara aside. \u201cWe\u2019re crashin\u2019 here,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI just called your parents. They said it was okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get them to agree to us sleeping out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them we\u2019d been drinkin\u2019. Ends up they\u2019d rather have us crash here than drive drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t planning on drinking at all.\u201d</p><p>I flash her a mischievous grin. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t know won\u2019t kill them, chica.\u201d</p><p>While the rest of the party finds their own private places to crash for the night, I grab a bunch of blankets Ram pulled out of the closet and lead Kiara outside.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI saw a dock by the lake. I know it\u2019s cold out, and rainin\u2019 . . . but it\u2019s covered and private.\u201d I take off my suit jacket and give it to her. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She slides her arms through the holes and holds it closed. I like her wearing my jacket, as if somehow she\u2019s mine and nobody else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Kiara says, grabbing me by the wrist. \u201cGive me your keys.\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell. This is it. This is where she tells me that she\u2019s not mine\u2014 and that she\u2019s still in love with Michael and wants to leave. Or that she just wanted me to take her to Homecoming and I got the wrong idea. While I had only one beer and am still painfully sober, I don\u2019t want to take her back home. I want this night to last as long as possible.</p><p>\u201cI need my purse,\u201d she explains. \u201cI left it in the car.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Her purse. I stand in the rain, looking dumbfounded at the girl who makes me want to hold on to her and never let go, as if she\u2019s my security blanket. My emotions are scaring the hell out of me. On the way to the dock we stop off at the car. She pulls out her purse and clutches it while we walk through the grass.</p><p>\u201cMy heels are sinking,\u201d she tells me.</p><p>I hand her the blankets and pick her up.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t drop me,\u201d she says, trying to juggle the blankets on her lap while holding on to my neck for dear life.</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d That\u2019s the second time tonight I told her to trust me. Truth is that she shouldn\u2019t, because after tonight all bets are off. But I don\u2019t want to think about tomorrow. Tonight needs to last me a lifetime. Tonight . . . tonight she can trust me, and I can trust her.</p><p>I set her down on the covered dock. It\u2019s dark, and the black clouds are covering the light of the moon. The top blanket is wet, so I\u2019m glad I grabbed a bunch. I take them from her and set the dry blankets on the wood dock, giving us a padded place to sleep.</p><p>I just don\u2019t know if sleep is all we\u2019ll be doing tonight. \u201cKiara?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cY-y-yeah?\u201d she says, her word echoing in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cCome lie with me.\u201d</p><p>50</p><p>Kiara</p><p>My heart flutters and I get a flush of excitement at his words. \u201cIt\u2019s d-d-dark. I can\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollow my voice, chica. I won\u2019t let you fall.\u201d</p><p>I reach out in the darkness as if I\u2019m blind, all the while shivering from nervousness or the cold rain. I can\u2019t tell which one is making me shake more. When our hands connect through the black night, he guides me to the blankets. I place my purse with the condom in it beside the blanket, then awkwardly hitch up my dress so I can sit in front of him.</p><p>He wraps his strong, muscular arms around me. \u201cYou\u2019re shakin\u2019,\u201d he says, pulling me back against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI c-c-can\u2019t help it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you cold? I can find more blankets if you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t leave. S-s-stay with me.\u201d I turn so my arms are wrapped around his waist. I\u2019m nuzzling into his body heat, not letting him go. \u201cI\u2019m just n-n-nervous.\u201d</p><p>He strokes my hair, now wet from the rain. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarlos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Since I can\u2019t see him, I reach up and feel his clean-shaven jaw. \u201cTell me something about your childhood that you remember. Something g-g-good.\u201d</p><p>It takes him a long time to respond. Doesn\u2019t he remember anything happy about his life in Chicago?</p><p>\u201cAlex and I always got in trouble after school when my ma was workin\u2019. Alex was supposed to be in charge of everythin\u2019, but the last thing a thirteen-year-old kid wanted to do was schoolwork right when we got home. We\u2019d have these contests we called the Fuentes Olympics and create the most ridiculous events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex had this stupid idea to cut off the tops of my mom\u2019s panty hose and put tennis balls inside each leg. He called them the Panty Discus. We\u2019d fling them around and around like windmills, then throw \u2019em as hard as we could. Sometimes the farthest would win, and sometimes the highest.\u201d He chuckles. \u201cWe were such idiots we\u2019d stick them back in my ma\u2019s drawer and think she\u2019d never suspect it was us who mutilated them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she tough with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say my ass still hurts from that day, and it was seven years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Alex and I spent a lot of time together back then. Once I wanted to be a pirate, so I went in my ma\u2019s room, took her jewelry box, and buried it in the woods by our house. Most of it was fake jewelry and stupid free pins she had to wear at work. I came home and drew a map with a big red X where I\u2019d hidden the box, then told Alex to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gives a short laugh. \u201cAnd neither could I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your mom freak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreak is an understatement, chica. Every day after school I went to the woods to dig up her jewelry, but never could find it. Worst part is that her weddin\u2019 ring was in the box . . . she never wore it because after mi pap\u00e1 died she didn\u2019t want to risk losin\u2019 it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. That\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t funny at the time, that\u2019s for sure. But one day I\u2019ll find that box, if someone else hasn\u2019t gotten to it first. Okay, your turn. What did you do to piss off the almighty Professor and the Queen Mother of Organic Teas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once hid my dad\u2019s car keys so he wouldn\u2019t go to work,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cNot bad enough. Give me somethin\u2019 else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to pretend to be sick so I could stay home from school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, I was the champion at that. Don\u2019t you got anythin\u2019 really bad? Or have you been a Goody Two-shoes your entire life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was mad at my parents, I used to spike their toothpaste with Tabasco sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. Nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my parents never hit me; they don\u2019t believe in it. I got a lot of time-outs during my rebellious stage when I was twelve, though.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughs. \u201cI live in a permanent rebellious stage.\u201d His fingers graze my knee and slowly move higher. When they reach the garter, he touches the lace. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA garter. You\u2019re supposed to take it off and keep it as a memento. K-k-kinda like a trophy for going far sexually with a girl. It\u2019s stupid, really. And kind of d-d-degrading if I think about it too m-m-much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it is,\u201d he says, amusement evident in his voice. \u201cI just wanted to hear your explanation.\u201d He slides it off me slowly, his lips following the path of the garter. \u201cI like it,\u201d he says as he slides my shoes off. The garter follows.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel rebellious now?\u201d I ask him.</p> <p>\u201cS\u00ed. Very rebellious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when you told me you and I were gonna get in trouble one of these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that day is here.\u201d I reach up with shaking hands and start unbuttoning his shirt. I slide his shirt open and place slow kisses down his solid, bare chest. I move my kisses lower and lower as I open more buttons. \u201cWant to get in trouble with me, Carlos?\u201d</p><p>51</p> <p>Carlos</p><p>Get in trouble with her? Hell, the first minute I laid eyes on her at Flatiron High I was in trouble. Now I\u2019m lost in the sensation of her soft, warm lips on my skin. I let her take control of this. I\u2019m holding back, even though my body is screamin\u2019 for more. Brittany told me to rein in my ego and attitude tonight. Problem is, I don\u2019t have a handle on either one right now.</p><p>Her wet tongue reaches out and grazes my left nipple. \u201cIs that o-o-okay?\u201d she asks.</p><p>No girl has ever done that to me. Hell, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever let any other girl do that to me. But this isn\u2019t just any other girl; this is Kiara. I have a feeling she could do whatever the hell she wanted right now and I\u2019d be fine with it. \u201cYeah. Feels damn good, chica. I can\u2019t wait to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>My breathing is ragged as I try to urge the rest of my body to calm down as her mouth moves to the other side of my chest.</p><p>I need to feel her against me. I never claimed to be patient. \u201cHey,\u201d I say, lifting her chin. I kiss her softly, wanting nothing more than to have her lying beside me right now. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p> <p>I slide my jacket off her shoulders and toss it out of our way. My fingers move up the zipper on her back, stopping when I reach the top. When I pull the slide lower and lower, exposing skin I wish I could see but can only imagine, Kiara unbuttons my pants and reaches inside to feel me over my shorts.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she says quickly, pulling her hand back. \u201cI n-n-needed to do s-s-something with my hands and wanted to know if I was t-t-turning you on.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. Leave it to Kiara to go searchin\u2019 in my pants for answers. \u201cDid you feel the evidence?\u201d I ask, amused.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispers. \u201cYou\u2019re turned on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so you know . . .\u201d I take her hand and place it over me again. \u201cJust thinkin\u2019 about you makes me hard.\u201d</p><p>I can sense her smile, even though I can\u2019t see it. I imagine her eyelashes are framing her chameleon eyes, which have probably turned a light shade of gray.</p><p>I slide her dress down her shoulders and don\u2019t stop until it\u2019s completely off her.</p> <p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she whispers, pulling away as I reach out to touch her.</p><p>I shrug out of everythin\u2019 but my underwear, then pull her under the covers with me. \u201cYou cold?\u201d I ask, noticing a slight shake of her hands when she reaches up and memorizes my face with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I lean over her and kiss her. \u201cGive me your germs,\u201d I tell her, making fun of Brandon\u2019s take on French kissing.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ll give me yours,\u201d she says against my lips. She opens her mouth to me and we slide our tongues together, the slippery wetness making me even harder\u2014 if that was even possible.</p><p>We move together, our bodies grinding against each other for what seems like an eternity. I reach inside her panties, feeling her at the same time her hands are wrapped around me.</p><p>\u201cI brought a condom,\u201d I tell her when I slide her panties down. We\u2019re both hot and sweaty, and I can\u2019t resist her anymore.</p><p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d she whispers against my neck. \u201cBut we might not be able to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I expect her to tell me this was all a mistake, that she really didn\u2019t mean to get me all hot and bothered just to tell me I\u2019m not worthy enough to take her virginity, but it\u2019s the truth.</p><p>She clears her throat. \u201cIt all d-d-depends on whether or not you\u2019re allergic to l-l-latex.\u201d</p><p>Latex? I\u2019ve never been asked that question. Maybe it\u2019s because every other girl I\u2019ve been with expected me to bring protection, or didn\u2019t expect me to use it at all. \u201cChica, I\u2019m not allergic to anythin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she says, reaching for her purse and pulling out a condom package. \u201cYou want me to put it on you?\u201d</p><p>She can\u2019t see the side of my mouth quirk up. I\u2019m not the virgin here, and yet tonight has been full of firsts for me. \u201cYou sure you can figure it out?\u201d</p><p>I hear the rip of the package opening. \u201cDo I hear a challenge?\u201d she whispers, then leans forward and says against my lips, \u201cOh, Carlos. You know I can\u2019t resist a challenge.\u201d</p><p>52</p><p>Kiara</p><p>\u201cWake up, chica.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Carlos\u2019s voice and the gentle touch of his fingers on my naked shoulder makes me stir. My legs are intertwined with his, my head is nestled in the crook of his arm, and memories of what we did a few hours ago are bringing bittersweet feelings to the surface.</p><p>I open my eyes. It\u2019s still dark, and we\u2019re both completely naked under the covers. \u201cHi,\u201d I say, my voice groggy and tired.</p><p>\u201cHey. We need to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Can\u2019t we just stay here longer?\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat and rolls away, the movement bringing the cold night air rushing to my skin. \u201cI forgot I\u2019ve got to bring Alex\u2019s car back tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I say dumbly. \u201cOkay.\u201d It\u2019s obvious he\u2019s freaking out and regretting what we did. I get it. I don\u2019t know what triggered it just now, but I get it.</p><p>\u201cGet dressed,\u201d he says, no emotion in his voice.</p><p>When he hands me his jacket after we\u2019re both dressed, I don\u2019t take it from him. \u201cI have my raincoat,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYou left it back in the car, Kiara. Wear this. It\u2019ll protect you from the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it,\u201d I say, then walk out into the rain in my dress and bare feet. I need his love. I need his honesty. Handing me his jacket is superficial protection anyway. The jacket is wet, inside and out.</p><p>In the car, after he shoves the blankets in the trunk and mumbles something about having to go to the Laundromat to clean them, we drive through the dark, empty streets in silence. The only sound is the rain tapping against the windows. I wish rain wouldn\u2019t remind me of tears so much.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d I ask him as I put my raincoat on so he doesn\u2019t see my arms shaking.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen s-s-stop acting like it. Tonight was perfect for me. Please don\u2019t ruin it.\u201d</p><p>He pulls into my driveway and parks next to my car. The rain is coming down harder now.</p><p>\u201cWait a few minutes until it lets up,\u201d he says as I gather my shoes and purse.</p><p>\u201cHow are you getting back home after you drop off the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just crash at my brother\u2019s place,\u201d he says.</p><p>I watch the droplets of rain make tracks down the car window, then disappear. I can\u2019t stay here for much longer without getting emotional. \u201cJust so you know, I don\u2019t regret tonight. Not one bit.\u201d</p><p>He looks right at me. The outside lights shine on his beautiful, strong face. \u201cListen, I need to figure things out. Everything is so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplicated,\u201d I say, finishing his sentence. \u201cLet me m-m-make this easy for you, then. I\u2019m not stupid to think things have changed just b-b-because we had sex. You made it p-p-perfectly clear from the beginning you weren\u2019t looking for a girlfriend. There, now I uncomplicated everything. You\u2019re free and clear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiara\u2014\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t stand to hear him tell me what a mistake tonight was, despite my declaration that it didn\u2019t have to mean anything. I get out of the car, but instead of running through the rain, I head straight for my car. I need to be in a place where I can think and cry without anyone hearing me. Right now, my car is my sanctuary. If Carlos would just drive off, I could cry in peace.</p><p>He opens his window and motions for me to open mine. When I do, he tries to say something. His voice barely carries through the sound of the rain coming down hard between us.</p><p>I lean out the car window. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He leans out his window, meeting me halfway. We\u2019re both wet and soaked, but neither of us seems to care. \u201cDon\u2019t run away from me when I need to tell you somethin\u2019 important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say, hoping he doesn\u2019t notice the tears running down my face, and praying they\u2019re getting mixed up with the rain.</p><p>\u201cTonight was . . . well, it was perfect for me, too. You\u2019ve turned my world upside down. I\u2019ve fallen in love with you, chica, and it scares the fuckin\u2019 shit outta me. I\u2019ve been shakin\u2019 all night, because I knew it. I\u2019ve tried to deny it, to make you think I wanted you as a fake girlfriend, but that was a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Kiara,\u201d he says before his lips move forward and meet mine.</p><p>53</p><p>Carlos</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d Alex asks me when I arrive at his place at five a.m.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m movin\u2019 back in,\u201d I say, pushing past him. At least until Keno and I disappear at the end of the month.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be at the Westfords\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay there anymore,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kind of hopin\u2019 you wouldn\u2019t ask that.\u201d</p><p>My brother winces as he asks, \u201cDid you do somethin\u2019 illegal?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cMaybe in some states. Listen, Alex, I got nowhere else to go. I guess I can always go live on the streets with the other kids whose brothers have kicked \u2019em out . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that bullshit, Carlos. You know you can\u2019t stay here. Judge\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>Judge\u2019s orders or not, I can\u2019t take advantage of Westford. He\u2019s one of the good guys that I used to think only existed in movies. \u201cI screwed the Professor\u2019s daughter,\u201d I blurt out. \u201cSo can I stay here, or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re jokin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It was Homecoming, Alex. And before you give me a lecture on right and wrong, remember that you screwed Brittany for the first time as a bet\u2014on the floor of our cousin\u2019s auto-body shop\u2014on Halloween, no less.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alex rubs his temples with his fingers. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anythin\u2019 about that night, Carlos, so don\u2019t act like you do.\u201d He sits on his bed and puts his head in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for askin\u2019, but I\u2019ve got to know . . . did you use a condom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Alex looks up and cocks a brow.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cI admit I\u2019m an idiot. But I still used a condom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least you did one thing right. You can stay tonight,\u201d Alex says as he tosses me a pillow and blanket from the closet.</p><p>Alex returned the air mattress, so I have to sleep on the floor. Ten minutes later, when the lights are off and I\u2019m staring up at the shadows on the ceiling, I ask, \u201cWhen did you first fall for Brittany? Did you know it all along, or did somethin\u2019 specific happen?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer at first, so I think he\u2019s sleeping. But then a long sigh fills the silence. \u201cIt was in Peterson\u2019s chemistry class . . . when she told me she hated me. Now stop yappin\u2019 and go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I turn on my side and go over the entire night in my head, starting with the moment I saw Kiara with that black dress on. The girl literally took my breath away. \u201cAlex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, annoyed.</p> <p>\u201cI told her I loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you mean it?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t kiddin\u2019 when I said the girl had turned my life upside down. What kind of girl wears baggy shirts every day, has a gay best friend, stutters when she\u2019s nervous, tapes shower schedules on the bathroom mirror, makes stupid cookie magnets just to piss me off, works on cars like a guy, and gets excited about the challenge of puttin\u2019 on a condom? The girl is fuckin\u2019 nuts. \u201cI\u2019m in deep shit, Alex, \u2019cause I think I\u2019d like nothin\u2019 better than to wake up with her every mornin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Carlos. You are in deep shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I gonna get out of this thing with Devlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m as clueless as you at this point, but I know who might be able to help us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in the mornin\u2019. In the meantime, shut up and let me sleep.\u201d</p><p>My cell phone goes off, the beeping sound echoing loudly throughout the small apartment.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is callin\u2019 you at this hour?\u201d Alex demands to know. \u201cIs it Devlin?\u201d</p><p>I read the text and laugh. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a text from your ex-girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Alex practically jumps out of bed and snatches my phone from me. \u201cWhat did she say? Why is she textin\u2019 you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your pants on, bro. She asked me how my date was, and I texted her back before I came to your place. I didn\u2019t know she was gonna respond right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to know if I\u2019m as miserable as she is,\u201d Alex says, reading Brittany\u2019s text.</p> <p>The glow of the screen on his face reveals it all. He\u2019s still hopelessly and disgustingly in love with Brittany. I\u2019d make fun of him if I didn\u2019t think I had the same look on my face when I woke up with Kiara\u2019s naked body pressed against mine and I realized that I\u2019d rather die than live one day without her. I haven\u2019t known her long at all, but just lookin\u2019 at her feels so right. Being with her feels like . . . home. It may not make sense to anyone else, but it does to me.</p><p>\u201cYo, Alex, just text back that you\u2019re a complete mess, and that you\u2019ll do anythin\u2019 to get her back . . . even if it means havin\u2019 dinner with her stupid parents and kissin\u2019 her pearly white ass for the next seventy or so years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about relationships, or pearly white asses? Forget it. I don\u2019t want to know the answer to that question.\u201d He walks into the bathroom with my phone and closes the door.</p><p>As long as he\u2019s not in the room, I might as well take advantage of his empty bed. He\u2019ll be in the bathroom awhile, texting his ex-girlfriend until she\u2019s his girlfriend again. I guess it didn\u2019t hurt that I was sure to text her just before I came here, knowing she\u2019s probably awake and as miserable as my brother is.</p><p>Back at the dock when I stroked Kiara\u2019s long hair as she fell asleep in my arms, a paralyzing fear washed over me. I realized that what I had with Destiny wasn\u2019t anything compared to what I have with Kiara. It scared me, and I panicked. I just needed to get away from her to process everything, because being near her makes me fantasize about a future with Kiara instead of focusing on reality\u2014 that I\u2019m leaving Colorado at the end of the month. As Keno said, there\u2019s really no other choice.</p><p>The next thing I know, Alex is shaking me. \u201cGet up,\u201d he orders.</p><p>\u201cI need a few more hours of sleep,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s already noon. And you got a message.\u201d</p><p>Brittany again. Those two better get back together so I have one less thing to worry about. \u201cI told you to text her and let her know you\u2019ll do anythin\u2019 to get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message wasn\u2019t from Brit.\u201d</p><p>I open one eye. \u201cFrom Kiara?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cYou did get one text from Kiara.\u201d</p><p>I bolt upright, the sudden movement giving me a nasty head rush. \u201cWhat did she want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted to know if you were okay. I texted her back and said you slept here last night, and you were still sleeping. But you got a voice mail message from Devlin. He wants to meet with you tonight.\u201d</p><p>I rub the knot of tension forming on the back of my neck. \u201cWell, I guess that\u2019s it, then. No use thinkin\u2019 he forgot about me. He spent a lot of energy recruitin\u2019 me. I don\u2019t see a way out, Alex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a way out.\u201d He tosses me a towel. \u201cTake a shower and get dressed. You can wear my clothes. Hurry up, we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p><p>Alex drives me to the Boulder campus. I follow him into one of the buildings, but freeze when we get to a door marked RICHARD WESTFORD, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d I ask my brother.</p><p>\u201cBecause he can help us.\u201d Alex knocks on the Professor\u2019s door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he says. Westford looks up when we enter his office. \u201cHey, boys. I trust you and Kiara had a good time last night. Colleen told me she was still sleeping this morning when I left the house, so I didn\u2019t have a chance to ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fun,\u201d I mumble. \u201cKiara is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA handful sometimes, I know. She definitely keeps us on our toes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was gonna say amazin\u2019,\u201d I tell him. \u201cYour daughter is amazin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take all the credit. Colleen has done an incredible job raising the kids. Kiara just needed to come out of her shell a bit. It was nice of you to take her. I know she really appreciated it. Now, I\u2019m sure Alex didn\u2019t want to meet me here just to shoot the breeze. What\u2019s on your minds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him what you told me,\u201d Alex orders.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Cause he\u2019s hard-core.\u201d</p><p>I take a look at the balding Westford. Hard-core, my ass. Maybe he used to be, but not now. He\u2019s a shrink now, and no longer a soldier.</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Alex says, getting impatient.</p><p>I\u2019m out of options, so I might as well tell him. Maybe Westford can come up with somethin\u2019 I haven\u2019t thought of. Unlikely, but it\u2019s worth a try.</p><p>\u201cYou know when I got beat up and I told you I got jumped near the mall?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cI lied. Truth is . . .\u201d I look over at Alex, who\u2019s urging me on. \u201cI got recruited by this guy named Devlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who Devlin is,\u201d the Professor says. \u201cI never met the guy, but I\u2019ve heard about him. He\u2019s into drug smuggling.\u201d His eyes narrow, and I detect a little bit of that hard-core personality trying to shine through. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be dealing drugs for Devlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my problem,\u201d I tell the Professor. \u201cIt\u2019s either I deal drugs, or he kills me. At this point I\u2019d rather deal drugs than die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not doing either,\u201d Westford says.</p><p>\u201cDevlin\u2019s a businessman who only cares about the bottom line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBottom line, huh?\u201d Westford leans back in his chair, those wheels in his brain working overtime. The chair tips so far back he has to quickly grab on to his desk so he doesn\u2019t tumble backward. The Professor is hard-core, all right. All the way down to his designer penny loafers.</p><p>\u201cAny suggestions?\u201d Alex asks. \u201cWe\u2019re out of ideas.\u201d</p><p>Westford holds up a finger. \u201cI might be able to help. When are you supposed to meet with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d Westford says.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Alex chimes in.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodie. We\u2019re startin\u2019 our own little renegados gang.\u201d I give a short laugh. \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk up to Devlin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch me,\u201d Westford says. \u201cNo matter what it takes, we\u2019ll get you out.\u201d</p><p>Is this guy kiddin\u2019 me? He\u2019s not my flesh and blood. He should think of me as a burden and liability instead of someone worth fighting for.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doin\u2019 this?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cBecause my family cares about you. Listen, Carlos, I think it\u2019s about time I tell you about my past so you know where I\u2019m coming from.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I gotta hear this.</p><p>I lean back in the chair, ready to get a long drawn-out sob story about how his parents were mean to him because they didn\u2019t buy him the exact toy he\u2019d asked for on his sixth birthday. Or the fact that a kid in high school beat him up for his lunch money. Maybe he was upset because his parents bought him a used car instead of a brand-new one when he turned sixteen. Does the Professor expect me to actually feel sorry for him? I can beat him in the sob-story department, hands down.</p><p>Westford shifts in his desk chair uncomfortably, then lets out a long breath. \u201cMy parents and brother died in a car accident when I was eleven.\u201d Whoa. I wasn\u2019t expectin\u2019 that. \u201cWe were driving home one night, it was snowing, and my dad lost control of the car.\u201d</p><p>Wait. \u201cYou were in the car, too?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI remember him swerving, then the car spinning.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cThen the truck colliding with the car. I can still hear my mom\u2019s screams as she saw the big headlights aiming right at her, and my brother looking to me as if I could somehow help.\u201d</p><p>He clears his throat and swallows, and my cockiness over winning the game of \u201cwhose childhood was worse\u201d starts to fade quickly.</p><p>\u201cAfter the impact, when my body stopped jerking around like a rag doll, I opened my eyes and saw blood splattered all over the car. I wasn\u2019t even sure if it was mine or my parents\u2019 . . . or my brother\u2019s.\u201d His eyes are glassy now, but he doesn\u2019t shed a tear. \u201cIt was like he was in pieces, Carlos. Even though I thought I would die if I moved because of the pain I was in, I needed to save him. I needed to save all of them. I held the gash in my brother\u2019s side together for as long as I could, the hot, fresh blood streaming all over my hands. The paramedics had to pry my hands off him, because I wouldn\u2019t let go. I couldn\u2019t let him die. He was just seven, a year older than Brandon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey all died except you?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cI didn\u2019t have relatives who could take me in, so I spent the next seven years bouncing from foster home to foster home.\u201d He stares right into my eyes. \u201cActually, I got kicked out of most of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou name it. Fighting, drugs, running away . . . basically, I was in need of some understanding and guidance, but nobody was willing or had the time to straighten me out. Eventually I turned eighteen and was put out on the streets. I found my way to Boulder, where there were plenty of kids like me. But living on the streets was dirty, and I was alone and had no money. One day I was begging for money and this man sneered at me and said, \u2018Does your mother know where you are and what you\u2019re doing with your life?\u2019 At that moment I thought about it. If my mother up in heaven was looking down at me, she\u2019d be pissed as hell at me for not trying to make something better out of myself.</p> <p>\u201cBut I realized that no amount of fighting would bring back my family,\u201d he continues. \u201cNo amount of drugs would completely erase the look in my brother\u2019s eyes begging me to help him. And I could never run away from that image, because running away just made things worse. I refocused that energy in the military.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to risk your life for me, Professor. It\u2019s bad enough I want to date your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have that discussion another time. Now let\u2019s focus on the problem we\u2019ve got right now. When are you supposed to meet with Devlin?\u201d Westford asks. Determination is radiating off the guy.</p><p>We agree to meet at seven and put some sort of plan in motion. What that actual plan is, I have no clue. Hopefully by seven o\u2019clock tonight Westford will figure it out. Truth is, it\u2019s a relief to finally put my life in the hands of someone I trust.</p><p>54</p> <p>Kiara</p><p>My mom is making pancakes for breakfast on Monday morning. \u201cWhat are you still doing home?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got some employees opening the store.\u201d She smiles warmly, that sweet smile that always made me feel better when I had to stay home sick in grade school. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice see you and Brandon and get you off to school for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you or Dad talked to Carlos?\u201d I ask for about the trillionth time since yesterday. Both of my parents have been acting strange since my dad came home from work yesterday. He locked himself in his office with my mom for hours. The two of them have seemed on edge since then, and I can\u2019t figure out why.</p><p>Carlos told me he was going to Alex\u2019s place, right before he told me he loved me. I wish he was here so he could assure me everything will be okay between us, but I know he needed to get away and figure things out in his own head.</p><p>The problem is, I never eased his biggest fear. He needs to know I\u2019m not going to suddenly give up on him or give up on us. I wish I could have talked to him before school today, but that didn\u2019t happen. He hasn\u2019t been back since he dropped me off early Sunday morning.</p> <p>I watch my mom as she vigorously mixes the pancake batter faster in her bowl. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>I walk over and put my hand on her arm, stopping her from mixing. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Mom? You have to tell me.\u201d I swallow, hard. I won\u2019t stand back and have the boy I love live in misery because he loves me back. It\u2019s not worth it. I would give him up if it meant making him happy. \u201cI need to know.\u201d</p><p>When she looks at me, her eyes are watery. Something is definitely up. \u201cYour father said he\u2019s taking care of it. I\u2019ve trusted him for the past twenty years. I\u2019m not going to stop now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it have to do with Carlos? Does it have to do with him getting beat up? Is he in danger?\u201d</p><p>My mom puts her hand on my cheek. \u201cKiara, honey, go to school. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m a little tense this morning. It will all be over soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going to be over, Mom?\u201d I ask in a panic. \u201cJust t-t-tell me.\u201d</p> <p>She stands back, obviously contemplating the consequences of spilling whatever secret she\u2019s holding. \u201cYour father said he\u2019s handling it. He had a long talk with Tom and David yesterday, his buddies from the military who work in the DEA\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel sick,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cIt will be fine, Kiara. Now get ready for school, and don\u2019t say one word about this to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs breakfast ready?\u201d my brother asks as he walks in the kitchen.</p><p>My mom goes back to mixing. \u201cAlmost. We\u2019re having whole-wheat pancakes.\u201d</p><p>Brandon gives her his famous pouty face, the one nobody in our house can resist. I wonder if that look will ever get old. Knowing Brandon, he\u2019ll still be using it when he\u2019s fifty. \u201cCan you put chocolate chips in them? Pleeeeease.\u201d</p><p>My mom sighs, then kisses his big cheeks. \u201cOkay, but put on your shoes so you\u2019re not late for the bus.\u201d</p><p>As she ladles the batter into the hot pan, I walk into my dad\u2019s office. I know it\u2019s terrible of me, and it\u2019s totally inappropriate, but I sit in front of my dad\u2019s computer and browse his history. First on the Internet and then in each of his document folders. If there\u2019s some clue to what\u2019s going on, I need to know. And since nobody will tell me, I have no choice but to snoop around and investigate, myself.</p><p>Unfortunately for my dad, but fortunately for me, he didn\u2019t erase his history. I pull up everything he\u2019s worked on in the past twenty-four hours. I look at a letter he wrote to his boss about introducing a new curriculum, an outline of the test he\u2019s working on for his class, and a spreadsheet with a bunch of numbers on it.</p><p>I study the spreadsheet. It\u2019s a financial one . . . detailing one of their bank accounts. The last entry is from today\u2014a debit for fifty thousand dollars\u2014leaving my parents with a balance of five thousand dollars. In the description line is one word: CASH.</p><p>My dad is taking fifty thousand dollars out of his bank account today. Somehow that money is connected to Carlos getting beat up, I just know it.</p><p>\u201cKiara, the pancakes are ready!\u201d my mom yells from the kitchen.</p><p>Obviously she\u2019s not going to tell me why my dad is taking a whopping fifty thousand dollars out of their bank account. I play innocent, eating my pancakes with a fake carefree smile on my face.</p><p>As soon as we\u2019re finished with breakfast, my mom rushes Brandon outside to his bus. I quickly sneak back onto my dad\u2019s computer because I have one more idea: I go to the maps website my dad usually uses and click on his recent searches.</p><p>Sure enough, the last two searches are addresses unfamiliar to me. One is near Eldorado Springs and the other is in Brush, a town that\u2019s about an hour and a half away from my house. I know there are a lot of drug problems there, and my heart sinks. What\u2019s going on? I quickly scribble down the addresses, then close the computer and try to look innocent when my mom comes back in the house.</p><p>At school, I open my locker and find two roses lying on top of my books, one red and one yellow. They\u2019re bound together by a black-beaded rosary and a note. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind they\u2019re from Carlos.</p><p>I kneel in front of my locker and read the note, written on a torn piece of notebook paper.</p><p>\u201cIs that Kiara Westford?\u201d Tuck says, coming up to me. \u201cThe one who doesn\u2019t call me back?\u201d</p><p>I clutch the flowers, rosary, and note to my chest. \u201cHi. Sorry, things have been crazy.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrow. \u201cWhat are you holding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the Mexican stud?\u201d</p><p>I look down at the beautiful flowers. \u201cHe\u2019s in t-t-trouble, Tuck. My dad\u2019s with him, and my mom is acting weird, and I need to help somehow. I can\u2019t just be left in the dark, when they\u2019re all in d-d-danger. I feel so useless. I just . . . don\u2019t know what to d-d-do.\u201d I don\u2019t even realize it at first, but I\u2019m rubbing the rosary beads with my fingers.</p><p>Tuck pulls me into one of the empty classrooms. \u201cWhat kind of trouble? Stop shaking, you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI c-c-can\u2019t help it. I think it has to do with Carlos and some drug dealers. I\u2019m freaking out because my dad thinks he\u2019s Rambo and can fix this. The DEA might be involved, too. I have a feeling he\u2019s in over his head, Tuck. I don\u2019t even know who this drug dealer guy is, except that after Carlos got beat up he referred to him as The Devil, in Spanish\u2014El Diablo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEl Diablo?\u201d Tuck shakes his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean anything to me. You know who you should talk to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cRam Garcia. His mom works in the DEA\u2019s office. She came to talk to us a while back about her job.\u201d</p><p>I kiss Tuck on the cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re a genius, Tuck!\u201d I say, then run off to find Ram.</p><p>A half hour later I\u2019m sitting opposite Mrs. Garcia, Ram\u2019s mom. She\u2019s wearing a navy pantsuit and a crisp, white shirt, looking very much like a DEA agent. When Ram gave me her number, I snuck out to my car and called her. I told her everything I know. I\u2019ve never ditched school before, but then again, I\u2019ve never been so worried about my dad and Carlos before.</p><p>Mrs. Garcia just got off the phone with my mom. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to have to stay here for a few hours. I can\u2019t let you leave this building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d I tell her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you know the address in Brush. Your knowledge could put a lot of people in danger.\u201d Mrs. Garcia sighs, then leans forward on her desk, piled high with manila file folders. \u201cTo be quite blunt, Kiara, your father, Carlos, and Alex have stumbled into something we\u2019ve been working on for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me they\u2019re not in danger,\u201d I beg, my heart pounding faster and faster.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got word to our undercover special agents working inside the gang that your father and the Fuentes brothers are to be protected. They\u2019re as safe as they can be on the brink of a DEA drug raid, and your father will take all necessary precautions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father has worked with us before on some criminal profiling and undercover ops,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping the operation a secret from Carlos and Alex for their protection. The less they know, the better.\u201d</p><p>What? My dad has worked with the DEA? For how long? He never mentioned anything before. I always see him as my dad, not some guy who does undercover work with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. All I knew was that he had friends from the military who he kept in touch with and went out with occasionally.</p><p>Mrs. Garcia can probably see the confusion written all over my face, because she leaves her desk and crouches in front of me. \u201cYour father was in some heavy-duty combat missions with some of our agents. He\u2019s well respected, and he knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d She looks at her watch. \u201cAll I can tell you is that we\u2019ve got them under constant surveillance, and our agents working on the inside are highly trained.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care that they\u2019re highly trained.\u201d Tears well up in my eyes, and I think about all the things I want to say to Carlos that I\u2019ve held back and all the times I should have told my dad how much I appreciate him. \u201cI want a one hundred percent guarantee that they\u2019ll all be fine.\u201d I tell Mrs. Garcia.</p><p>She pats my knee. \u201cUnfortunately, there are no guarantees in life.\u201d</p><p>55</p><p>Carlos</p> <p>I look over at my brother, his knuckles white as he grips the wheel of his car. The Professor spent all day going over the different scenarios, just in case Devlin or any one of his guys decided to go back on their word and start shooting at us.</p><p>When we met last night, the Professor arrived at Alex\u2019s place in a black turtleneck and black pants, as if he were Zorro. I think the poor guy misses whatever covert military operations he used to be involved in, because his raw excitement couldn\u2019t be more obvious.</p><p>Don\u2019t ask me how Westford came up with the idea of making a deal with Devlin. I spent an hour arguing with him, telling him there was no way in hell I\u2019d let him pay tens of thousands of dollars of his own money to get me out of trouble. I argued until my throat was sore, but Westford insisted. He said he\u2019d negotiate with Devlin with or without my consent.</p><p>Before he made the deal with Devlin, Westford and I sat down for a long talk. He was willing to offer to buy Devlin off for whatever it took . . . on one condition.</p><p>I\u2019d have to enter the military or go to college.</p> <p>That was it. The Professor was willin\u2019 to take a shitload of cash out of his own bank account to buy my way out of Devlin\u2019s chains, with rules attached. \u201cIt\u2019s like slavery,\u201d I told him this afternoon as we went over the plan in detail.</p><p>\u201cCut the crap, Carlos. Is it a deal or not?\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>I shook hands with him, but to my surprise he pulled me forward into a bear hug and said he was proud of me. It feels weird to have a guy who knows the truth about who I am and what I\u2019ve done still care about my future and want me to succeed.</p><p>Devlin gave the Professor twenty-four hours to come up with fifty thousand dollars to buy me out, but only after I showed up at some secret location in Brush and proved to have a united front with Rodriguez in front of allies of the Guerreros. I guess some big deal is about to happen, but the Mexican suppliers don\u2019t trust Devlin. I wonder if the street war with the R6 has already started.</p><p>We\u2019re in the car on the way to meet with Devlin and Rodriguez in Brush. Westford has the cash in a duffel between his feet. I\u2019m in the backseat, looking at the two guys who\u2019ve become my posse. My heart is beating strong and hard at the prospect of bringin\u2019 my brother and the Professor. I was supposed to be in this alone, without draggin\u2019 anyone down with me. Devlin is my problem, and they\u2019ve made him theirs.</p><p>I remember when Kiara brushed her fingers over one of my tattoos. La rebelde. I\u2019m not that big of a rebel if I need an old man and my big brother as my posse. And while havin\u2019 them with me doesn\u2019t sit well in my gut, I admit I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019d do without \u2019em.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s still time for both of you to back out. I can go in there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not happenin\u2019,\u201d Alex says. \u201cI\u2019m comin\u2019 with you, no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Westford pats the duffel filled with money. \u201cI\u2019m ready for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a helluva lot of money, Professor. You sure you want to part with it? You can wipe your hands clean of me and keep the money. I wouldn\u2019t even blame you.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not backing out now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf one of us feels that somethin\u2019 is off, get out fast,\u201d I tell them. \u201cDevlin makes sure he\u2019s got numbers on his side.\u201d</p><p>Alex drives slowly through Brush. The streets remind me of Fairfield, our town back in Illinois. We didn\u2019t live on the richest side of town. Some people refused to drive through the south side for fear of being carjacked, but it was home to us.</p><p>A bunch of guys our age are standing on the corner, eyeing Alex\u2019s unfamiliar car suspiciously. If we look like we know what we\u2019re doing and have a purpose, we\u2019ll be just fine. If we act like we have no clue where we are or how to get where we want to go, then we\u2019re toast.</p> <p>As Alex drives down a winding driveway and ends up in front of what looks like an abandoned ware house, chills race up and down my spine. Why did Devlin insist on us meeting him here?</p><p>\u201cYou ready to do this?\u201d Alex says as he puts the car in park.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. Both Westford and Alex turn back to look at me. \u201cI just wanted to say thanks,\u201d I mutter. \u201cBut you think Devlin\u2019ll take your money and run, or shoot us dead and take the money anyway?\u201d</p><p>Westford opens the car door. \u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d</p><p>We all pile out of the car, our senses heightened and on alert. As much as I made fun of Westford for wearing all black again today, he does look like a badass. An old, balding badass, but a badass nonetheless.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a guy on the roof, two more at two o\u2019clock, and ten o\u2019clock,\u201d Westford tells us.</p><p>What was his nickname in the military, Eagle Eye?</p><p>A guy is standing at the entrance, waiting for us. He\u2019s probably in his twenties, but he\u2019s got blond hair so bleached it\u2019s almost white. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting you,\u201d he says in a gruff voice.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I say, taking the reins and stepping inside first. If anyone starts shooting, I\u2019ll be the target, and Alex and Westford might still be able to get away. As the white-haired guy pats us down for any weapons, Westford is clutching that sack of money as if it\u2019s too painful to part with. Poor Westford. He\u2019s totally out of his league. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t want you to do this, right?\u201d I ask him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue,\u201d Westford says. \u201c \u2019Cause that would be a waste of time and get you nowhere.\u201d</p><p>The white-haired guy leads us to a small office off to the side. \u201cWait here,\u201d he orders.</p><p>Here we are, two Fuentes brothers and one ex-military guy clutching a duffel bag filled with fifty thousand dollars of freedom money.</p><p>Rodriguez comes in the room and sits on the desk. \u201cSo what do you have, Carlos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney. For Devlin,\u201d I say. I guess The Big Guy didn\u2019t show up.</p><p>\u201cI was told you had a benefactor to buy you out. You know people in high places, huh?\u201d he says, eyeing the Professor.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>He holds out his hand. \u201cGive it to me.\u201d</p><p>Westford grips the duffel tighter. \u201cNo. Devlin and I made the deal together, and we\u2019re going to see it through together.\u201d</p><p>Rodriguez gets in his face. \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight, Grandpa. You\u2019ve got no leverage here. In fact, you should be kissin\u2019 my ass or you might find yours on the ground with a hole in it . . . or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I do have leverage,\u201d Westford says. \u201cBecause my wife has a letter she\u2019s been instructed to give to the police if we all don\u2019t come home safely. Believe me, a well-respected professor won\u2019t easily be forgotten. You and Devlin will be hunted down.\u201d</p><p>Westford doesn\u2019t release the death grip on the duffel.</p><p>A frustrated Rodriguez leaves us again. I wonder if next time he\u2019ll just shoot us and take the money for himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat, do you think Devlin\u2019s gonna give you a receipt for it?\u201d I ask the Professor. \u201cI don\u2019t think you get a tax break for payin\u2019 someone off.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cEven in the face of danger, you\u2019re still a smart-ass. Do you ever give it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. It\u2019s just part of my charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know Devlin\u2019s even here?\u201d Alex asks.</p><p>The Professor doesn\u2019t bat an eye. \u201cIf there\u2019s a guy on the roof and two more monitoring the comings and goings, the Boss is here. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Devlin himself comes sauntering in a half hour later. He obviously made us wait on purpose, to make sure we knew who was in charge. Devlin glances at the duffel. \u201cHow much is in there?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cThe amount we agreed on . . . fifty thousand.\u201d</p><p>Devlin walks around the room, eyeing us skeptically. \u201cI checked you out, Professor Westford.\u201d</p><p>For half a second, Westford looks nervous. He masks that nervousness an instant later. I don\u2019t know if my brother or Devlin noticed, but I sure did. \u201cAnd what did you find out?\u201d Westford asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the strange part about it,\u201d Devlin says. \u201cNot much. Makes me think you\u2019ve got some kind of intelligence connections. Maybe you came here just to set me up.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but laugh. The Professor doesn\u2019t have intelligence connections. Maybe in his glory days he was some covert special-ops soldier, but now he\u2019s just Kiara and Brandon\u2019s dad. The guy gets a hard-on for Family Fun Night, for God\u2019s sake.</p><p>\u201cThe only connections I have are with the psychology department at the university.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, \u2019cause if I find out you have any connections with the cops, you and these kids will regret you ever met me. Rodriguez told me your wife has a letter for the cops to ensure your safety. I don\u2019t like threats, Professor. Open the duffel.\u201d</p><p>Westford opens it and takes out the money. When Devlin is convinced all the money is there and isn\u2019t marked, he orders me to pick it up and hand it to him.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019ve got one more piece of business,\u201d Devlin says, gesturing to me. \u201cYou and Rodriguez are going to be meeting some very important friends of mine. In Mexico.\u201d</p><p>What? No way.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t part of the deal,\u201d Westford says.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m changing the deal,\u201d Devlin says. \u201cI have the money, a gun, and the power. You\u2019ve got nothing.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he says it, the ground starts shaking as if we\u2019re in the middle of an earthquake.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bust,\u201d someone yells through the door. Devlin\u2019s men have all scattered, giving up their duties to protect their boss to save their own skins.</p><p>DEA agents in blue jackets burst in the warehouse, guns at the ready. They order everyone to the ground.</p><p>Devlin\u2019s eyes are crazy-wild as he pulls a .45 from his waistband and aims it at the Professor.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I scream, then lunge forward to knock the gun out of Devlin\u2019s hand. Nobody is gonna kill Westford, even if that means I end up in the morgue. I hear the gun go off and feel like my thigh is on fire. Blood drips down my leg and lands on the cement floor. It\u2019s surreal and I\u2019m afraid to look at my leg. I don\u2019t know how bad it is, only that it feels like a thousand bees have clung to my thigh with their stingers. Alex rushes Devlin, but Devlin is too quick. He turns the gun on my brother, and a deathly panic washes over me. I scramble toward Devlin to stop him, but Westford holds me back just as the white-haired guy bursts into the room with a Glock. \u201cPolice! Put the gun down!\u201d he orders.</p><p>What the\u2014</p><p>In a flash, Devlin turns his gun on the guy and they exchange gunfire. I hold my breath but let it out when Devlin is down, clutching his chest. His eyes are open and blood is streaming on the floor under him. The biting pain at the prospect of losing my brother or Westford at the hands of Devlin makes me squeeze my eyes shut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I open them, I see a glimpse of Rodriguez out of the corner of my eye. He\u2019s got a gun pointed to the white-haired undercover agent. I try to warn the agent, but to my surprise Westford grabs Devlin\u2019s gun and shoots Rodriguez as if he\u2019s a trained sharpshooter.</p><p>Westford barks orders to one of the DEA agents as he and Alex carry me out of the ware house.</p><p>\u201cAre you DEA?\u201d I ask Westford through gritted teeth, because my damn leg stings like a mother.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. Let\u2019s just say I still have friends in high places.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes this mean you get to keep the fifty Gs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I guess that means our deal is off. You don\u2019t have to go to college or the military.\u201d</p><p>Two paramedics rush over with a gurney. They strap me down, but I reach for the Professor before they can wheel me away. \u201cJust so you know, I\u2019m goin\u2019 to enlist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you. But why?\u201d</p><p>I groan against the pain but manage to give him a half smile. \u201cI want to make sure Kiara\u2019s got a boyfriend who has more to offer than a hot bod and a face that could make angels weep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you ever lose the ego?\u201d Westford asks me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d When his daughter kisses me, my ego flies out the window.</p><p>56</p><p>Kiara</p><p>I stroke Carlos\u2019s arm and let him squeeze my hand as we\u2019re waiting to hear what the doctor has to say about his leg. A stoic Alex also hasn\u2019t left Carlos\u2019s side since we arrived at the hospital. He\u2019s scared, and it looks like he blames himself for not preventing his younger brother from getting hurt. But it\u2019s all finally over.</p><p>My dad found out that Carlos\u2019s mom and brother were threatened, so with their permission he\u2019s arranged for them to come to Colorado. He\u2019s also helping them get temporary housing, which is great.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad says you\u2019ll live,\u201d I tell Carlos as I lean forward and kiss him on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cIs that a good thing?\u201d</p><p>Okay, Kiara, it\u2019s time to spill it, I tell myself. It\u2019s now or never. I lean close to him, so only he can hear me. \u201cI . . . I think I need you, Carlos. The forever kind of need.\u201d I look up. Carlos\u2019s eyes are locked on mine. I want this, I want him. More than that, I really do need him. We need each other. The closer I get to him, the more I feed off the energy and strength radiating from him.</p><p>I can tell he wants to say something, to fill the silence like he usually does, but he holds himself back. Our eyes are still locked, and I won\u2019t look away. Not this time.</p><p>I slowly reach out a shaky hand and touch the center of his chest over his shirt, wanting to take his pain away. He\u2019s breathing heavier now, and I can feel his heart beating against my palm.</p><p>He cups my cheek in his hand, his thumb gently stroking my skin. I close my eyes and lean into his touch, melting in the warmth of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dangerous,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you make me believe in the impossible.\u201d</p><p>After Carlos\u2019s surgery, my entire family is surrounding his hospital bed. There\u2019s a knock at the door. Brittany walks in tentatively.</p><p>\u201cThanks for calling me, Kiara,\u201d she says.</p><p>Carlos told me to call right before his surgery, after he told me about Alex and Brittany breaking up. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Carlos says. \u201cBut I\u2019m on morphine, so you might want to get that in writing.\u201d Alex is about to walk out of the room, but when he reaches the door Carlos blurts out, \u201cAlex, wait.\u201d</p><p>Alex clears his throat. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m gonna regret sayin\u2019 this, but you and Brittany can\u2019t break up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already did,\u201d Alex says, then looks at Brittany. \u201cRight, Brit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want, Alex,\u201d she says, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He walks up to her. \u201cYou wanted to break up. Mamacita, don\u2019t put the blame on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to keep our relationship a secret from my parents. I don\u2019t. I want to scream to the world that we\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s afraid, Brittany,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Alex reaches out and tucks her blond hair behind her ear. \u201cThat your parents will make you realize you deserve better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex, you make me happy, you make me strive to work hard. I get caught up in your future dreams and am desperate to be part of it. Whether you like it or not, you\u2019re a part of me. Nobody can change that.\u201d She looks up at him, tears streaming down her face. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>He cups her cheek and swipes her tears away. Without a word, I hear Alex choke up as he pulls her close and doesn\u2019t let go.</p><p>A half hour later, Alex, Brittany, and my parents have escaped to the hospital cafeteria. Tuck walks in with a big vase filled with hot pink carnations and a balloon attached that reads FIFTY PERCENT OF ALL DOCTORS GRADUATE IN THE BOTTOM HALF OF THEIR CLASS\u2014 HOPE YOUR SURGERY WENT WELL!</p><p>\u201cHey, amigo!\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cOh, hell.\u201d Carlos snorts in fake annoyance. It makes me feel good to know he hasn\u2019t lost his fighting spirit after what happened today. \u201cWho invited you?\u201d</p><p>Tuck sets the vase down on the window ledge and smiles wide. \u201cOh, come on. Don\u2019t be such a grump. I\u2019m here to cheer you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy bringin\u2019 me pink flowers?\u201d Carlos says, gesturing to the vase.</p><p>\u201cActually, the flowers are for Kiara because she has to deal with you.\u201d He pulls out the balloon and ties the string to the hospital-bed handrail. \u201cConsider me your candy stripper . . . I mean striper.\u201d</p><p>Carlos shakes his head. \u201cKiara, tell me he didn\u2019t just call himself a stripper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe nice,\u201d I tell Carlos. \u201cTuck drove all the way here because he cares about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say you\u2019ve grown on me,\u201d Tuck admits, then brushes his long hair out of his face. \u201cBesides, if I didn\u2019t have you to annoy, my life wouldn\u2019t be the same. Face it, amigo . . . you complete me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re loco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a homophobe, but with Kiara\u2019s and my guidance you\u2019ve got potential to be a decent and tolerant human being.\u201d Tuck\u2019s cell starts ringing. He pulls it out of his pocket and announces, \u201cIt\u2019s Jake. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He disappears into the hallway, leaving me and Carlos alone. Well, we\u2019re not entirely alone. Brandon is in the chair in the corner of the room, busy playing one of his video games.</p><p>Carlos grabs my wrist and pulls me onto the bed with him. \u201cBefore today, I was plannin\u2019 on leavin\u2019 Colorado,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI figured it was better if I wasn\u2019t a burden to your parents or Alex anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d I ask nervously. I need to hear him say he wants to stay here for good.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave. Did your dad tell you my ma and Luis are comin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only reason I\u2019m stayin\u2019, chica. I can\u2019t leave you any more than I could walk out that door right now while my leg is busted up. I was just thinkin\u2019 . . . should we tell your parents now or later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them what?\u201d I ask, eyes wide.</p><p>He kisses me softly, then says proudly, \u201cThat we\u2019re in a serious, monogamous, committed relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. And when I get out of here, I\u2019m gonna fix the door to your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I fix it first,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He bites his bottom lip and looks at me as if I just turned him on. \u201cIs that a challenge I hear in your voice, chica?\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and weave my fingers through his. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He pulls me closer to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not the only one in this relationship who loves a challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd just so you know for the future, I like my double-chocolate chip cookies warm and soft in the middle . . . and without magnets glued to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. When you decide to bake me some, let me know.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, then leans his head toward mine.</p><p>\u201cAre you guys about to French-kiss?\u201d Brandon blurts out.</p><p>\u201cYeah. So close your eyes,\u201d Carlos says, then pulls the blanket over us, giving us as much privacy as we can get right now. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave you again,\u201d he whispers against my lips.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m never letting you leave.\u201d I lean back a little. \u201cAnd I\u2019m never leaving you either. Remember that, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does this mean you\u2019re going to learn to mountain climb with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anythin\u2019 with you, Kiara,\u201d he says. \u201cDidn\u2019t you read the note I put in your locker? I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m yours,\u201d I tell him. \u201cForever and always and then some.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>TWENTY-SIXYEARS LATER</p><p>Carlos Fuentes watches as his wife of twenty years tallies up the day\u2019s receipts. Business was good at McConnell\u2019s Auto Body, which they bought when he got out of the service. Even during the slow years they\u2019d gotten by just fine. His wife always appreciated the simple things in life, even when they could afford more. Hell, hiking near The Dome made her smile more than anything else\u2014that hike had become a weekly ritual for them.</p><p>Now skiing or snowboarding, that was another thing altogether. Carlos took Kiara and their kids to the resorts in the winter, but he watched from a distance as Kiara taught all three of their girls to ski, then snowboard. They especially liked it when their uncle Luis came along, because he was the only Fuentes brother who was crazy enough to race them down the black-diamond slopes.</p><p>Carlos wipes his hands on a shop cloth after changing the oil on his old friend Ram\u2019s car. \u201cKiara, we gotta talk about this kid your dad coerced me into letting stay with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad kid,\u201d Kiara says, looking up at her husband and giving him a reassuring smile. \u201cHe just needs some guidance, and a home. He reminds me of you a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kiddin\u2019? Did you see how many piercings that delinquent has? I bet he\u2019s got \u2019em in places I don\u2019t even want to know about.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, their oldest daughter, Cecilia, drives up to the garage door with the delinquent in the passenger seat beside her.</p><p>\u201cHis hair is too long. He looks like a chica who needs a shave,\u201d Carlos says.</p><p>\u201cShh, be nice,\u201d his wife reprimands.</p><p>\u201cWhere were you two?\u201d Carlos questions accusingly as the two high school juniors simultaneously hop out of Cecilia\u2019s car.</p><p>Neither of them answers.</p><p>\u201cDylan, follow me. We need to have a man-to-man.\u201d Carlos catches the delinquent roll his eyes at him, but he follows Carlos into his private office in the corner of the body shop. Carlos closes the door and settles into the chair behind his desk while he motions for Dylan to sit in the guest chair opposite him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been stayin\u2019 with us a week already, but I\u2019ve been so busy at the shop I haven\u2019t been able to go over house rules,\u201d Carlos says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cListen, old man,\u201d the kid says lazily, then leans back and plants his dirty shoes on Carlos\u2019s desk. \u201cI don\u2019t follow rules.\u201d</p><p>Old man? Doesn\u2019t follow rules? Damn, this kid needs a good ass-kicking. Truth be told, Carlos did see a bit of his old, rebellious self in the kid. Dick was the best stand-in father Carlos could ever ask for back when he\u2019d first come to Colorado . . . Hell, he\u2019d called the Professor \u201cDad\u201d even before he married Kiara, and couldn\u2019t imagine how his life would have turned out without her father\u2019s guidance.</p><p>Carlos pushes Dylan\u2019s feet off his desk, then thinks back to the time Kiara\u2019s dad recited a speech similar to the one about to come out of his mouth. \u201cUno, no drugs or alcohol. Dos, no profanity. I have three daughters and a wife, so keep it clean. Tres, curfew on weekdays is ten thirty; on weekends it\u2019s midnight. Cuatro, you\u2019re expected to clean up after yourself and help around the house when asked, just like our own children. Cinco, there\u2019s no TV unless you\u2019re done with homework. Seis . . .\u201d He couldn\u2019t remember what his father-in-law\u2019s sixth rule was, but it didn\u2019t matter. Carlos had his own rule he wanted to make sure was stated loud and clear. \u201cDating Cecilia is out of the question, so don\u2019t even think about it. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, one.\u201d The delinquent leans forward and looks Carlos straight in the eye with a mischievous smirk. \u201cWhat happens when I break one of your fuckin\u2019 rules?\u201d</p>   </body></html>"]
