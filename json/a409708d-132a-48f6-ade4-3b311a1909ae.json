But now this?</p><p>The Victorian charm of the place reminded him of his own hometown of Silver Town, where he should have stayed!</p> <p>The sign pronounced: Closed until 11 a.m. due to unforeseen family emergency.</p><p>With so much work to do managing the leather-goods factory and running the town and pack as his older brother\u2019s sub-leader, Jake had only intended to drop off his photography and then drive the three hours back home. He hadn\u2019t originally planned to display his photography at all. But his brother\u2019s mate had finally persuaded him, despite him having balked at the notion. And Jake had to admit sales of his photographs in a Denver art gallery had exceeded expectations. Still, he had half a mind to forget the whole damn thing and return home. But he knew Lelandi would be upset if he didn\u2019t go through with this, and in her pregnant state, she easily shed a bundle of tears with the least provocation. He really didn\u2019t want to see her break down again.</p><p>Hell, he would have eaten breakfast with the family first, had he known of the delay. All business all the time, Jake glanced around the town, wondering what else to do with himself until the place opened up. He hated wasting time like this.</p><p>Then a woman caught his eye as she stopped briefly to surreptitiously take a picture of the license plate on a black Mercedes parked across the street at a restaurant. Dressed in a businesslike, short-waisted suit jacket, a modest-length skirt, and three-inch heels, she was a real looker with her thick, dark brown curls piled on top of her head in an elegant twist. Her actions, combined with her appearance, grabbed his attention. He photographed wildflowers as a break from work, while she was photographing a license plate for work? Undercover job maybe?</p><p>He wondered what color her eyes would be: smoky gray, chocolate brown to match her rich thick hair, misty green, oceanic blue\u2014or something in between.</p> <p>The wolfish side of his curious nature was piqued. She didn\u2019t look like the type he\u2019d picture working undercover. And he wondered who her target was. Maybe she was a private investigator checking on a wayward wealthy husband, not a cop after a criminal.</p><p>Then the woman slipped her small camera into a little black purse and entered the restaurant, her high heels clicking on the pavement.</p><p>As soon as the door shut behind her, Jake considered the place, a burgundy-red Victorian house with white gingerbread millwork fitted into gables and dormers, ornately carved corbels clinging beneath beams, and lacy fretwork running across the length of the house. The restaurant looked a lot classier than those where he was used to eating. The meals probably cost a fortune.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t quit thinking about the slip of a woman and what she was up to. He didn\u2019t really want to eat at such a high-class joint and waste a lot of money on a breakfast that he was sure he could eat for a fraction of the cost somewhere else. But he still headed across the street to the restaurant, telling himself it had nothing to do with the woman, that it was just a way to kill time and that the restaurant was the closest one to the gallery. He tried to ignore the steak-and-eggs place just down the street, which was more like what he was accustomed to and where the meals were most likely much more at his price. Not that he couldn\u2019t afford the higher prices. He just wasn\u2019t inclined to pay them if he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>When he entered the restaurant, he found it filled with talkative customers seated at lace-covered tables or tucked into booths where the tables were bare, which suited him better. But the woman who had garnered his interest was nowhere to be seen. Tiffany light fixtures hung over the tables, while large windows faced out onto the street, their lace curtains tied back to permit the view of the snow-tipped mountain in the distance. Royal-blue velvet swags hung above them, fringed in gold. Feminine and floral. Nothing that appealed to him.</p><p>He preferred Silver Town Tavern\u2019s more rough-and-tumble, old silver-mining town appearance. But then he considered the floral landscapes hanging on the walls and thought his work would fit here nicely.</p> <p>A young woman wearing a Victorian gown and a lace-trimmed apron quickly showed him to a booth with too bright a smile and a wayward perusal of his physique. But the overly tanned blond didn\u2019t garner his attention like the woman with the dark hair and creamy skin had. The sway of her hips in the fitted, black pin-striped skirt, the way her hands had lovingly held the camera when she quickly took the picture she needed, and the way her full peach lips had parted as she concentrated on getting a good shot still lingered in his thoughts. He had to admit part of his interest was because she carried a camera, the way he often did, even if she didn\u2019t use hers in the pursuit of a hobby. Maybe when she wasn\u2019t working, she did.</p><p>\u201cSir, is this booth all right?\u201d the woman asked, breaking into his ruminations.</p><p>\u201cThis will be fine.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to ask if the hostess had seen the woman who had entered before him and could seat him where he could further observe her. He normally photographed strictly wildflowers, but in her case, he would have made an exception and taken her portrait. But not in a sterile studio environment. On a high, sloping field at the foot of the mountains with soft natural lighting. Wearing faded blue-jean short shorts and a skimpy tank top, barefoot and braless, the object of his fascination would sit in a field of pale purple daisies with their gold-button centers facing upward and lacy towering firs providing a backdrop. That\u2019s the portrait he wanted to take of her.</p><p>A waitress, dressed in a Victorian gown and apron similar to the hostess\u2019s, hurried over with a menu and a glass of water. She was just as friendly and just as unabashedly bold about giving him the once-over. But he was sure it had more to do with feminine interest than with a bigger tip since he was the only male around the age of thirty who was seated alone in the establishment. Then again, maybe she was sizing him up to see if he fit the usual clientele\u2014rich resort visitor\u2014or if he was an off-season ski bum who had mistakenly found his way into this place.</p><p>He\u2019d dressed up a little more than usual because he would be meeting with the art gallery owner, although he probably could have worn anything and the gallery staff wouldn\u2019t have cared. Artists were artists, after all.</p><p>But he wore a vest with his stonewashed jeans and a pin-striped dress shirt, although he\u2019d rolled the sleeves up to his elbows and left a couple of the buttons down the front of the shirt undone. And he hadn\u2019t bothered to shave for a couple of days, giving him more of a rugged appearance. Dressy just didn\u2019t suit him much.</p><p>Light fluffy music played overhead, while the aroma of coffee brewing and steak sizzling on a grill wafted through the air. His stomach rumbled in anticipation as he considered the menu, narrowed his eyes to study the prices, and nearly had a stroke.</p> <p>\u201cHighway robbery,\u201d he muttered under his breath. He would have walked out, but he still wanted to see the woman again and learn what she was up to. Then he waved to the waitress, told himself he only lived once\u2014if paying exorbitant prices meant he was living\u2014and placed his order.</p><p>When the waitress left, Jake saw her\u2014the woman who\u2019d caught his eye outside the restaurant\u2014now sitting at a booth across from his. His heartbeat quickened, and he sat up a little taller. She was observing a man in his mid-fifties who was seated at a nearby table and wearing a fitted dark-gray suit. He was swarthy, fat faced, and fat lipped, with a bulbous nose, receding black hair, and dark cold eyes. Something about the man warned Jake that he was a threat, not someone to anger. Not just a man having an affair on his wife.</p><p>The fact she was watching the man bothered Jake. He saw it as a case of her flaunting danger. She was maybe five-five in stocking feet with a small build and tendrils of curls spilling from her upswept hair to tickle the back of her neck. She was not nearly big enough or mean-looking enough to take on whomever the man was and win the confrontation. Now Jake could see her eyes\u2014the color of rich chocolate, just like her hair. Her eyes were narrowed a hint and her brows knit into a small frown.</p><p>She pursed her full glossy lips, a shimmering shade of peach, as she wrote something on a notepad. Her gaze returned to the man. Her lips garnered another look as she worried the bottom one a little, and Jake had the urge to coax her mouth into a smile with his, to take away the frown, to give her something positive to think about. Like him.</p><p>She glanced toward the door as a man walked into the restaurant. Wearing an expensive black suit, he was similar in build to the first: stocky and dark-haired, swarthy and all business as he glanced around the place with a wolf\u2019s wary manner. The woman quickly averted her eyes.</p><p>Surveillance. Jake bet she was working some kind of surveillance. But who were the men she was watching? And who did she work for?</p><p>The waitress returned to the table, delivered his steak and eggs, and asked, \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like?\u201d She favored him again with a way too intimate pass, the connotation in her sugar-coated voice suggesting she could be on the menu if he was the least bit interested.</p><p>With a quick smile to indicate he\u2019d gotten her message, but just as quick a shake of his head to show he wasn\u2019t interested, he said, \u201cNo, thanks. I have everything I need, right here.\u201d He glanced back at the woman in the suit as if emphasizing he meant that included the woman who continued to be the object of his fascination.</p><p>The waitress\u2019s smile quickly faded. \u201cOh, you\u2019re interested in her.\u201d She paused, as if she was thinking of saying something more about the woman. But then she shook her head and said, \u201cI\u2019ll check back with you in a bit, then.\u201d She gave the woman in the suit a derisive look, but before the waitress could hurry off, Jake seized her scrawny wrist.</p><p>When she stopped and turned to face him, her pale hazel eyes wide, he released her wrist and asked, \u201cDo you know the woman?\u201d</p><p>She gave a soft snort. \u201cOh, yeah, she and her mother have been coming here for years. Skiing, ice skating, hiking, you name it.\u201d Then the waitress leaned down lower and said conspiratorially, \u201cShe\u2019s mixed up with some bad types, and nobody but nobody wants to associate with them\u2014or her. Let\u2019s just say it can lead to a dead end.\u201d She gave a little shrug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBad types?\u201d</p><p>The waitress rolled her eyes. \u201cMob ties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in with the Mob?\u201d Jake asked, sounding incredulous. The guys she was observing looked like they might have connections, but...</p> <p>\u201cHer mother was dating one of them.\u201d</p><p>That put a totally new spin on the situation. \u201cAnd the daughter?\u201d</p><p>The waitress\u2019s lips curved up in a menacing grin. \u201cSure, like mother, like daughter. She gave up an honest-to-goodness decent sort to consort with a bunch of criminals.\u201d</p><p>He had the sneaking suspicion the daughter wasn\u2019t seeing someone like that. If anything, she was watching the two men in a way that made him think of a police sting operation, not as though she was friends with them. If she had been, she would have joined them.</p><p>But the waitress\u2019s words still gave him pause. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d The waitress flipped around and hurried off, swaying her hips in an exaggerated fashion.</p><p>He sliced into his juicy steak, the aroma of the T-bone making his stomach rumble again, but the food still didn\u2019t interest him as much as the woman. Taking a bite of the tender meat, which was seasoned to perfection and melted in his mouth, he sat back and observed her further. She looked to be all work, no play, just like he was normally.</p><p>For some inconceivable reason, he wanted to gain her attention. Maybe because she\u2019d hooked his to such a degree. On the other hand, he enjoyed watching her, studying her, and taking pleasure in her without her knowledge, without the anxiety-ridden pretension that often existed between two people meeting for the first time.</p><p>He looked again at her jacket. She could be an undercover cop. Maybe. A slight bulge under her jacket on one side could indicate she was packing a gun.</p><p>He raised his brows. She could be armed and deadly. Even more intriguing. Although the waitress\u2019s words still lingered in his thoughts: she could be dating a mobster like her mother was. She could be armed because she was one of the criminal element. Yet he couldn\u2019t help but feel she was working as an undercover cop. But if she was, he thought she was in way over her head on this case.</p><p>He glanced around the room. None of the other diners seemed to be watching the men or her. Why didn\u2019t she have backup if she was a cop?</p> <p>Getting involved in human affairs that didn\u2019t pertain to the good citizens of Silver Town was not a good idea. Yet if she encountered any trouble, he\u2019d be in the thick of it, rescuing her without thought of reward. Well, maybe a little reward. A heartfelt hug from that sweet body of hers would do for starters. A kiss from those lips would be welcome.</p><p>He sat back and finished his steak and eggs, while she sipped more of her tea. She\u2019d taken a bite of a cinnamon roll, but nothing more. Was she as frugal as he? Or just not a big breakfast eater? Or was ordering the breakfast just as a ruse while she conducted her surveillance?</p><p>He wondered what it would be like to pull the pins from her hair, release it over her shoulders, and comb his fingers through the lush, silky strands. To disarm her\u2014to see her wearing something softer, something that would reveal her womanly curves even more, or wearing nothing at all. And to taste her lips, sweetened by sugary cinnamon.</p><p>Turning his attention to the two men she was observing, he listened, trying to hear their exchange. The men spoke in low tones, but with the murmur of conversations in the busy restaurant and the distance Jake was from the men\u2019s table, he couldn\u2019t make out their words, even with his enhanced wolf\u2019s hearing. The men didn\u2019t seem to take any notice of the woman, either feigning ignorance or showing her that her effort to rattle them was in vain.</p><p>Jake glanced at one of the plate-glass windows and the pin-striped awning stretched over the top to shade customers when the sun rose in the sky. Two men sat out front in a darkened Mercedes\u2014the one bearing the license plate that his mystery woman had photographed earlier. Bodyguard, driver, he assumed. And parked in front of that vehicle was another: similar make and model, same setup\u2014two men.</p><p>Inside the restaurant, the two men under surveillance shook hands. One smiled, the look pure evil. The other nodded.</p><p>Jake glanced back at the woman to see her take on the matter, and his blood instantly heated with ire. A bruiser of a man wearing a dark gray suit towered over her as he motioned for her to leave. When the hell had he entered the restaurant and approached her?</p><p>She remained seated, not budging, looking up at the man with loathing as he loomed over her. Jake could see that the man was wearing the hardware to back up his threatening posture, hidden under his jacket and pressed slightly into the fabric as a show of force. He had one hand inserted underneath the jacket, holding the gun.</p> <p>Like a wolf ready to take down its prey, Jake rose from his booth with a cautious, predatory stalking motion. The man waved the gun underneath his suit jacket again in a sweeping motion toward the door. Defiantly, the woman continued to balk, glaring at him, not moving an inch, not saying a word. Jake admired her stalwart nerve. But he didn\u2019t believe she\u2019d win this argument. Not without a little wolfish backup.</p><p>Wishing he had at least asked the waitress the woman\u2019s name before playing his cards, since the waitress seemed to know a good deal about her, Jake stalked across the floor to join her before the beast forced the issue. The woman\u2019s gaze shifted to Jake, eyes widening like pools of melted dark chocolate and drawing him in.</p><p>The bulky beast of a man turned to face Jake and narrowed his already beady eyes in confrontation. Jake conveyed a real threat of his own in his posture, just like a wolf would, from his steely gaze to his taut muscles and rigid back. Even the hair on his arms was standing erect, just as his fur would be if he were wearing his wolf coat\u2014another form of intimidation that made him appear bigger, more of a threat.</p><p>If anyone could deal with a tyrant like the armed guy in the suit, Jake was the man for the job, with or without a weapon. But fighting the man wasn\u2019t what he had in mind, unless there was no other way around it.</p><p>Jake shifted his attention to the lady, offered a friendly smile, spread his hands a little as if in greeting, and said to her, \u201cJulia Roberts!\u201d</p><p>His smile broadened as he leaned down to give her a kiss on the cheek\u2014the part of the plan he liked best\u2014and her eyes were as round as twin full moons as she stared back at him. His hand moved to her back, gently caressing as if he\u2019d known her forever and encouraging her to play along with him. His mouth lingered longer than was necessary on her cool, soft cheek, his free hand taking hers in much too possessive a manner for never having made her acquaintance before. If nothing else, he knew he needed to play his role well if he was going to convince the thug to back off.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were going to be here today?\u201d His voice had already changed from darkly interested to huskily enthralled, which wasn\u2019t part of the plan, but more of that wolfish nature he had no control over.</p><p>His gaze moved to view her full shimmering lips, now parted in surprise. He wanted to kiss her there, taste her, feel her, sample the sweetness of those lips.</p><p>\u201cTom Hanks,\u201d she said, quickly recovering, winking, and trying for lighthearted, but he saw the look of worry in her darkened eyes.</p><p>With his hand to his chest, he feigned being mortally wounded. \u201cLast week I was your Gerard Butler. Tom Hanks this week?\u201d He shook his head, squeezed her hand reassuringly, and gave her one of his more wolfishly friendly smiles. Her hand was icy, and he held on tighter, hoping to show her she had nothing to fear. \u201cFriend of yours, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo darlin\u2019,\u201d she said with a drawl that didn\u2019t sound quite real. \u201cHe\u2019s mistaken me for someone else.\u201d She cast a brilliant smile at the man and then Jake, but the smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes. It was more of a we\u2019ll-show-you expression aimed at the thug.</p><p>Jake rewarded her with a slight tightening on her hand to say, \u201cWell done.\u201d</p><p>He was in love. She was someone who could tease like he could on the spur of the moment, someone who could stand up to a man nearly twice her weight who towered over her and was a real threat. She would be perfect for Jake, if she were a wolf. And for the time being, he didn\u2019t give a damn about the ramifications of the problems that could create. All he cared about was getting to know the woman better.</p><p>\u201cI asked the lady nicely if she\u2019d come with me,\u201d the thug said, his voice thickly menacing. \u201cNow I\u2019m going to ask not so nicely.\u201d A telltale buzzing in the man\u2019s pocket shut him up. He pulled out a cell phone and gruffly said, \u201cHello?\u201d His icy slate-colored eyes stared Jake down, threatening him to back off or else.</p><p>Jake wasn\u2019t intimidated. The challenge suited him. Face-to-face wolfish confrontations were much easier to deal with than sneaky underhandedness.</p><p>He remained standing next to what he assumed was an armed damsel in distress, although he wanted to remove her from the powder keg of a situation. The men in the vehicles out front were most likely just as armed, so he was certain he\u2019d be no match for all of them, even if the woman had a cannon underneath her jacket.</p><p>He might not be the pack leader in Silver Town, but he was just as alpha as his older brother and had no qualms about taking this man or anyone else down. But as a lupus garou, he was mindful of which battles to fight and which to leave alone. Going against a whole army of trigger-happy thugs wasn\u2019t in the plan.</p><p>The man nodded as if responding to the caller, then shoved his phone into his pocket. He scowled at Jake, then the woman, directing his comments at her. \u201cJust so\u2019s you know, next time, you won\u2019t get off so easy.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned, nearly stumbled over the chair in his way, and cursed a string of swear words. After shoving the chair out of the way, he sauntered off like a disgruntled lumbering grizzly. Several customers looked up from their meals and glowered at him for disturbing the peace with such a vulgar commentary as he made his way out of the restaurant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d recommend we leave, but they\u2019ve got more guns outside, so it would be prudent if we stay a little longer.\u201d Jake slid into the booth with her so they could talk more privately. Although she quickly scooted over to allow him room, his leg still touched hers, and the shock of it sent heat sliding through him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But what made him even hotter was that she didn\u2019t pull away. Even though the intimation was that this was her booth, her table, and she wasn\u2019t going to be forced into the corner, the challenge in her posture only intrigued him more. But her eyes\u2014which were now focused on his mouth\u2014were what really got his attention.</p><p>His gaze strayed again to her lips. Upon closer inspection, he saw glittering speckles of cinnamon sugar just before her tongue slipped out and moistened her bottom lip, as if she was suddenly conscious of something on her lips that she needed to wipe away quickly. But she\u2019d missed some at the corners and the top of her luscious lips, and he was dying to taste them and her.</p><p>Trying to get his mind off the reaction his body was having in close proximity to hers and the sensuous way she licked her lips as if preparing them for a kiss, and wanting to know just what this business was with the mobsters, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>Jake tilted his head toward the table where the two men now ate their breakfast in silence, indicating that he knew the woman sitting beside him had been watching them with more than casual interest. He wanted to know just what was going on with the lady. Especially since he\u2019d had to rescue her once already. And he suspected she might need his services again if she continued what she was doing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t expect her to tell him anything, since he suspected she was working undercover. But he was beginning to have his doubts about that because he was fairly sure she would have a partner. And the notion that her mother had Mob connections still lingered in his thoughts.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you.\u201d Her eyes and lips hinted at a half smile that sparkled with feistiness.</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a bounty hunter.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open before he could hide his surprise better.</p><p>Her smile broadened. \u201cTold you that you wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>She took a sip of tea from a dainty teacup covered in tiny pink roses, and the way her lips touched the rim made him wish she was touching her mouth against his with the same pressure and with parted lips, drinking him in.</p><p>His eyes strayed to the slight bulge under her jacket where he assumed her gun was. \u201cBounty hunter.\u201d He sounded a little incredulous.</p><p>Here he\u2019d thought she was an undercover cop and most likely better trained for the job. The thought crossed his mind that the waitress was mistaken or had lied about this woman\u2019s mother dating someone in the Mob. If the waitress\u2019s explanation held any truth, he wondered if the woman and her mother were involved with a rival family. But a bounty hunter?</p> <p>She\u2019d get herself killed. He didn\u2019t like the scenario in the least.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re after one of those men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one on the right. Mario Constantino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. And you\u2019re going to walk up to him, serve a warrant, and arrest him.\u201d His gaze shifted from the well-dressed thug to the delicate woman sitting beside him, her heady feminine fragrance\u2014a mixture of woman and the hint of an exotic floral bouquet\u2014stirring his interest. But she wasn\u2019t any competition for the bastard sitting at the table.</p><p>\u201cNot yet. If he doesn\u2019t show up for his court date by tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll serve his warrant and re-arrest him. But there\u2019s another one. Danny Massaro. He works for this guy. Danny is supposed to appear at court in Denver today, but according to my informant, he\u2019s meeting with Mario sometime soon in Breckenridge\u2014and he\u2019s already missed his court appearance. Danny\u2019s not the man dining with Mario this morning, though. I want Danny, too. And I will get them. Both.\u201d</p><p>Jake released an exasperated sigh. He imagined that issuing a warrant for one of them would be more than reckless. But trying to arrest the two of them?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d She might be armed, but she was no match for a bunch of guys with Italian names who had Mafia connections.</p><p>\u201cI told you that you wouldn\u2019t believe me. Want another cup of coffee?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you know I was drinking coffee?\u201d He waved to the waitress for a fresh cup.</p><p>\u201cI saw you sitting in that booth over there, watching me, before you looked to see what the men who I\u2019d been observing were doing. Until you saw the big ape who was trying to force me to go outside with him.\u201d She paused for a heartbeat, judging Jake\u2019s response.</p><p>His lips parted for a fraction of a second. He was damned surprised. He\u2019d thought she hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d existed until he\u2019d come to her aid.</p><p>She raised her brows just a hair, undoubtedly amused to see his reaction. She was good at this surreptitious stuff. Really good, he had to admit.</p><p>\u201cBut even before that, I observed you at the art gallery across the street, looking vexed because it was closed. I would guess you were on a schedule\u2014self-imposed\u2014and didn\u2019t like the proverbial wrench in your plans. You were trying to figure out what to do with your spare time until the gallery opened, saw the restaurant, and came in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw you and came in here,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>If she was so observant, and he suspected from her analysis of the situation that she was\u2014which reminded him of a wolf\u2014he wondered why she\u2019d left out the most important part. And he wondered why she\u2019d taken such a keen interest in him. Maybe for the same reason he was intrigued by her. Or she might have thought he was trouble like these guys were and had just been keeping an eye on him.</p><p>\u201cYou were taking a picture of the Mercedes\u2019s license plate in a covert way. And that made me curious,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled, and this time it was a beautiful, heartwarming smile\u2014her expression all-knowing\u2014like she\u2019d had him pegged from the beginning and wasn\u2019t clueless enough to believe his interest had everything to do with her taking a picture of a license plate instead of having more to do with the picture-taker herself. She might not be a wolf, but she sure seemed perceptive.</p><p>She lifted her cup of tea again. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the kind of place you usually frequent, I imagine.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows, surprised again that she seemed so astute. He couldn\u2019t help but admire that quality in her\u2014particularly when she could read him so well and was even interested in doing so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too...\u201d she said, her gaze sweeping over him in an intimate way, and then she trailed her fingertips down his leather vest\u2014and his body reacted, tightening with raw need. Her gaze slid lower to his stonewashed jeans, and then she lifted her eyes to meet his gaze, \u201c...rugged, in a casual, cool sort of way.\u201d She brushed her fingers lightly over his cheek, tickling the short hairs of the couple of days\u2019 beard growth, her eyes considering his face. \u201cYep, too rugged for the likes of this place.\u201d</p><p>When she dropped her hand from his face, he asked, \u201cSo you knew I\u2019d come in here looking for you?\u201d His voice was a whole lot huskier than he\u2019d intended. He wondered if after he\u2019d kissed her and pretended a deeper friendship, she had played the role for Mario, the criminal she had under surveillance. In any event, Jake was game to deepen the role.</p><p>\u201cSure. That\u2019s why when you first came in, you couldn\u2019t find me. I ducked inside and found a spot to observe you, while looking for where Constantino had perched, and then when I thought you looked fairly harmless...\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe it. She\u2019d ditched him when she entered the restaurant so she could observe him, and he hadn\u2019t even been privy to the fact? The woman was a marvel. And definitely a wolf at heart.</p><p>But then her comment sank in. \u201cI looked fairly harmless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, all right\u2014handsomely, devilishly dangerous but more in an innocuous way. More of a lady-killer type, if anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocuous?\u201d He chuckled at that. He could be quite dangerous, and it didn\u2019t take much of a push to shove him in that direction. But the other part? \u201cLady-killer?\u201d He really didn\u2019t see himself that way.</p><p>\u201cThe way the hostess and then the waitress were sizing you up...\u201d She let the thought trail off and shrugged.</p><p>He wondered about the waitress. If she knew this woman so well, how well did his bounty hunter know her? He was more amused than anything, though, by her response that he was a lady-killer. He couldn\u2019t believe that, as close as she\u2019d come to real trouble, she could switch gears like this so completely. Nothing about her was timorous, and he liked that about her\u2014to an extent. He still thought she should be a lot less confrontational with the bad guys.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the waitress? She seemed to know you,\u201d he asked, hoping to get to the heart of the matter.</p><p>The woman gave a little laugh, but her response was slightly bitter in tone. \u201cOh, yeah, we go way back. Tami Lawson and I went to school together. I\u2019m sure she had only good things to say about me.\u201d With a refilled cup of tea, she said, \u201cI\u2019m Alicia Greiston, by the way. I\u2019d offer my hand, but I\u2019m afraid that would look kind of strange since we\u2019re supposed to know each other already. Rather intimately, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d go for another kiss.\u201d He was only half-joking. Except this time, he wanted to kiss those cinnamon-and-sugar-sweetened lips of hers.</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cYeah, like I said, a real lady-killer.\u201d</p><p>Not in the least bit reluctant to feed into her fantasies of the kind of man he was, he reached over, took her hand, and brushed his lips against the back with a soft caress. He swore she melted a little on the seat next to him. \u201cJake Silver, completely at your disposal.\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows, her lips still imparting a small smile, and gently pulled her hand free of his. \u201cHave a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d At least not on him.</p><p>She took a deep breath that seemed exaggerated and said, \u201cThat means I\u2019ll have to protect us both now.\u201d</p><p>Not in this lifetime. Although this matter wasn\u2019t any of his concern, he was ready to make it so, if that kept her from getting herself killed. He couldn\u2019t help that her being a bounty hunter troubled him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you been a bounty hunter long?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI cashiered at a department store before this.\u201d</p><p>Hell, he hadn\u2019t expected that. \u201cSold merchandise?\u201d he asked in disbelief.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Cashed employee payroll checks, took payments on layaways and credit cards, sold fishing and hunting licenses, and gift-wrapped merchandise at Christmastime until we hired a professional wrapper for the season.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping up mobsters in Christmas ribbon and bows came to mind. Just what kind of training did she have? Trying to get his disbelief under control, Jake frowned, hoping that he wasn\u2019t jumping to conclusions and that she had been a bounty hunter for a number of years and was well prepared to arrest the most dangerous criminals. Maybe even that she\u2019d served as a cop. Something that would have made her seem better qualified and prepared.</p><p>\u201cExactly how long have you been a bounty hunter?\u201d He kept his voice even, without a thread of emotion that might antagonize her. Or at least he tried to.</p><p>She raised her brows just a hint. \u201cSince a few months ago.\u201d</p><p>At that revelation, he couldn\u2019t stifle a grunt of disbelief quickly enough and revealed his true feelings. The knowledge that she hadn\u2019t been doing this long filled him with rife incredulity. The woman had to have a death wish.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how to use a gun?\u201d He managed to cut off the \u201cat least\u201d part of his statement before he spoke the words, although they had been on the tip of his tongue.</p><p>At that point, the tension fairly sparked between them. Alicia\u2019s hackles raised as her whole body stiffened beside him, her gaze riveted to her teacup, her fingers tightening around it. Her family must have mentioned how dangerous and perilous her job could be and warned her not to take part in such foolhardiness. He couldn\u2019t imagine a woman whose appearance and training seemed so at odds with the kind of job she was determined to do actually accomplishing it.</p><p>But then she visibly relaxed. Her whole demeanor became coolly detached, rather than reflecting her anger because he was prying into her business and questioning her ability to do her job. In that instant, he sensed a disconcerting vulnerability. With her jaw set and her eyes examining her teacup, she seemed determined to see this through.</p><p>He would bet the homestead that she was somehow being forced into this venture. And he intended to find out why and stop it before she got herself killed.</p><p>Jake Silver was the kind of dangerously exciting man Alicia had learned to avoid when she was growing up\u2014and damn if she wasn\u2019t drawn to him like a spike of winsome, colorful foxglove seeking shade. His masculine touch made her fantasize about all kinds of carnal pleasures.</p><p>She loved how he had spied her, become intrigued with her, and had ultimately come to her rescue, knowing if he hadn\u2019t, she might have been forced to call the local police. Which she didn\u2019t want to do. How would it look if she couldn\u2019t face these guys on her own?</p> <p>And she didn\u2019t have a choice. It was her life or theirs. Simple as that.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t need any man questioning her abilities with regards to bounty hunting. She\u2019d been fingerprinted and had her background checked. She had never committed a felony\u2014she was one of the good guys\u2014and she\u2019d completed her bail-fugitive-apprehension training, which was necessary to become a bounty hunter.</p><p>Working for a licensed bail agent, she\u2019d arrested several fugitives in the past few months, although none that were Mob-related. But the others had only been practice before she went after the ones that really counted.</p><p>Trying not to sound waspish, she said, \u201cSure I know how to use a gun. My first...\u201d Alicia paused. She had not intended to talk about that mistake.</p><p>The look on Jake\u2019s face was one of rabid curiosity. She was about to tell a secret, and he was dying to know the truth. She sighed. She\u2019d already let the proverbial cat partway out of the bag. \u201cMy first husband taught me how to shoot at a firing range. He was in the army\u2014military police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went hunting, too,\u201d she said defensively, then was annoyed with herself for explaining her qualifications to him as if she owed that to him.</p><p>Jake\u2019s frown didn\u2019t fade. \u201cWhat did you kill?\u201d</p> <p>She looked down at her hands, now strangling the linen napkin in her lap. \u201cNothing. Irvin was lousy at hunting. We never could find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Irvin was your first husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d She hadn\u2019t planned to let on that she\u2019d had two, but mentioning that the first was... she sighed, first, indicated she\u2019d had more than one, even though she\u2019d meant to say ex-husband.</p><p>Jake raised his brows. She had not planned on telling him her whole blasted life story. \u201cMy second husband,\u201d she said, in way too small a voice.</p><p>Jake\u2019s lips curved up just a hint. \u201cIs that all of them?\u201d</p><p>She gave him an annoyed look. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be all that old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what happened to the husbands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of them were big mistakes. The last one was out of my life three years ago\u2014after a year of marriage.\u201d</p><p>Jake sat back in his chair. \u201cSure there aren\u2019t any more of them?\u201d</p><p>This time she smiled. \u201cNo. I had an aunt who\u2019d had eight of them, though.\u201d</p><p>He whistled softly.</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cLuckily, no children and only her death stopped her from having more husbands. I swear I\u2019m not going down the same path as my aunt. I\u2019ve strictly sworn off men. What about you? Been married before? Currently married or engaged? Your age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty. Never been married, engaged, or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d She hadn\u2019t meant to sound so skeptical, but he seemed a trifle amused by her reaction.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She wondered how that could be, as good looking as he was. But then the sinking realization he might be gay hit her, and she didn\u2019t say anything more.</p><p>Jake finished his coffee, set his cup down, and pointedly said, \u201cYou\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m thirty and have never been married.\u201d</p><p>Hating to be put on the spot, she waffled. \u201cNot everyone marries as many times as I did before the age of twenty-three.\u201d As soon as she said that, it sounded lame to her. He was thirty, not twenty-three.</p><p>\u201cI like women, Alicia.\u201d He gave her a pleasantly amused smile. \u201cI\u2019ve just never found the right one to convince me to settle down.\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s grim expression softened. \u201cI never found the right guy either, but that didn\u2019t stop me from marrying two times. I\u2019m cured of my impulsiveness now, though.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s why, Jake thought ruefully, she had become a bounty hunter. Nothing impulsive about that. At least he managed to curb the urge to shake his head. He had imagined that she was a trained weapons expert, knowledgeable in the martial arts, maybe ex-military or an ex-cop. Not a former cashier in a department store.</p><p>Before he could ask her why she was a bounty hunter\u2014figuring maybe for the excitement, for some sense of adventure, or because it paid better\u2014she posed a question. \u201cWhat were you doing at the art gallery?\u201d</p><p>The notion she was in the business of asking questions and getting answers made him think she was like a police officer on a mission.</p><p>This got tricky, though. Only his pack members knew about his hobby of photographing flowers in the wild. Even if anyone thought it wasn\u2019t a macho thing to do, no one let on. At least not to his face. As no-nonsense as she seemed, he imagined she\u2019d think his hobby was foolish. And as much as he told himself that shouldn\u2019t matter, he did care what she thought.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cYou have paintings you\u2019re leaving off, right? Nude women? Old girlfriends? New girlfriends?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. The woman was precocious. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if I told you, I\u2019d ruin your image of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhhh,\u201d she said, drawing out the word. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandscapes, then.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and shook his head, but he was still thinking of where he wanted to go next with Alicia. In an instant, she had changed his mood from annoyed at having to hang around town until the gallery opened and then spending a fortune on a meal to being possessively chivalrous and wanting to just spend some time in town enjoying the day with a woman like her.</p><p>\u201cSo where do we go from here?\u201d he asked, curbing the urge to pull her from the booth and escort her to the nearest bed and breakfast. But only if they served breakfast in bed.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>As much as Jake knew he had to get back to Silver Town, he was beginning to think he didn\u2019t need to return all that quickly. He was owed a vacation, and he couldn\u2019t remember a time when he\u2019d taken one. Work and pleasure were all wrapped up in Silver Town and the pack. That\u2019s all that had ever mattered.</p><p>But now she mattered. Alicia Greiston, bounty hunter and bundle of sensuous woman, who was bound to get herself into real trouble. But the way she \u201cplayed\u201d her role with him made him think she also was interested in furthering their relationship. He knew he should back off, knew that unless it would be a one-night stand with a human female, he shouldn\u2019t be encouraging this. Yet he had no desire to stop what was taking place. And he didn\u2019t believe a one-night stand would offer a fix for what he was feeling.</p><p>He could drop off the photographs and take in some sights with Alicia, if she could give up her surveillance for the time being and was interested in spending the day with him. Who knew what could happen with regard to the night?</p><p>She was about to say something when she glanced back at Mario as he walked past the table, not giving any indication he knew she existed. The other man remained seated, eating his breakfast.</p><p>As soon as Jake felt Alicia tense, as if she were a wolf ready to go after her quarry, he wrapped his arm around her shoulders and pulled her tight against his body, even though he already had her blocked from leaving the booth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shook his head and leaned over, his mouth brushing her ear as he whispered, \u201cToo many of them.\u201d</p><p>Her expression shifted from hunting mode to resigned acquiescence. That was, until she spoke and he realized she wasn\u2019t as resigned to admitting she couldn\u2019t pursue the man as he had thought she was.</p><p>\u201cYou have to take your artwork to the gallery.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cMust be open by now.\u201d Her gaze met his in too businesslike a fashion. \u201cWe could meet at a little Italian place up the street for lunch later today. If you\u2019re interested and you\u2019re hungry by then.\u201d</p> <p>He was interested, but he was damned concerned that she intended to ditch him a second time, only in this instance, so she could keep Mario under further surveillance.</p><p>\u201cItalian?\u201d Jake asked. The insinuation was that the Italian guys might eat at the Italian restaurant, and she had inside information that they\u2019d be stopping for lunch there. Which didn\u2019t set well with Jake. If he was to have a meaningful lunch with the lady, he wanted all her attention.</p><p>She shrugged, but the renewed sparkle in her eyes and the slight upward tilt of her mouth meant she had caught his meaning. She lifted her chin just a little. \u201cOr anything else you\u2019re interested in.\u201d</p><p>His smile was sure to appear purely predatory. She had to know he was interested in her.</p><p>\u201cTo eat,\u201d she said, realizing he was thinking like a man would.</p> <p>His smile broadened as his gaze remained on hers. A faint blush colored her cheeks and creamy throat.</p><p>She quickly added, \u201cThey have steak houses, sandwich shops, seafood places, you name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you go with me to the art gallery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve got some errands I need to run.\u201d Her tone was clipped and businesslike again. She wasn\u2019t going to be talked out of going it alone.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it. He thought she was serious about lunch, but after she\u2019d ticked off these men, he believed she\u2019d be headed into real danger. And he was certain she was going after them further.</p><p>\u201cSo what will it be?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cSteak house, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, steak house it is. Main Street at 1 p.m.\u201d She rose to leave and straightened her skirt.</p><p>He wanted to change her mind, but she seemed determined. He stood to let her out of the booth and noticed that the suited man still seated at the table was watching them now. Jake took her hands, leaned over, and slanted his mouth over hers, meaning to show the man that Alicia was his, and if anyone thought of harming her, there\u2019d be hell to pay. Before he could do much more than press the merest of kisses against her soft mouth, she pulled her hands free.</p><p>Prepared to accept her rejection, Jake was about to separate from her, figuring she objected to going any further with this\u2014at least here in the restaurant. Until she placed her arms securely around his neck, her breasts pressed against his chest in a tormentingly seductive way, and with an upturned face, offered her mouth to him.</p><p>Eagerness propelled him to take advantage, but he reigned in his baser needs and licked her sugary cinnamon-sweetened lips with a sensuous sweep of his tongue. His hands roamed down her back until they rested at the bottom edge of her jacket on the sensuous curve of her buttocks.</p><p>He said quietly, \u201cOpen your mouth to me.\u201d</p><p>The suggestion was like unlocking the bedroom door and letting him in. His tongue penetrated the small opening as she barely parted her lips to him, more in surprise than in agreement, he thought. But he breached any defenses she might have erected, one of his hands cupping the back of her head as he forged forward, the other keeping her body pressed against his hardness.</p><p>She responded like a woman caught up in lust, at first shyly kissing his tongue back, her body a little reserved. Then as if he\u2019d overpowered her will to keep this at a standoff, he sensed her resolve falter. Felt her tongue play with his in a more aggressive manner, felt her body arch against him, pressing her sexy, soft body against his. He nearly groaned when she deepened the kiss.</p> <p>Sweet cinnamon and spicy woman greeted him in a way he\u2019d never experienced with any other. Her soft body fit against his hard one, which was getting harder by the second. He wrapped his arms around her back and held on tighter until he finally felt the gun at her waist.</p><p>She murmured against his lips, \u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t have a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you meant that one. Maybe we could have dinner later?\u201d He was already hoping to spend the day and the night with her, keeping her safe while enjoying her companionship for a while longer.</p><p>She gave him a wistful smile back. For an instant, he thought he might be pushing her too fast. But this was the first time a woman had truly sparked his interest in eons, and he didn\u2019t want to let her go just yet. Her wit and wolfish intuition fascinated him.</p><p>A long-term commitment with a human female was fraught with difficulties and something his kind would frown on, but a tryst with one was perfectly acceptable if both were willing and agreeable. She seemed as interested as he was. Although a nagging concern told him that she wasn\u2019t someone he could get out of his system easily with an overnight venture.</p><p>\u201cYour bill,\u201d Tami the waitress said, her face screwed up in hate as she openly glared at Alicia. She turned to Jake and gave him a small smile as she handed him the bill.</p><p>Alicia slipped it out of her hand before Jake could take it. \u201cMy treat,\u201d Alicia said to Jake, \u201cfor the rescue.\u201d</p><p>He fished out two twenties and tossed them on the table. \u201cYou can get the dessert later.\u201d He winked at Alicia and saw Tami\u2019s scowl deepen more. With his hand guiding the small of Alicia\u2019s back, he walked her outside. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with your former schoolmate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted Harold. My first husband. I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been seeing her behind my back. He married me instead. If I\u2019d known what they\u2019d been up to, I would have given her my blessing and let her have him. But, unfortunately, I didn\u2019t know about their affair until after we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy must\u2019ve been crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was, for not having my eyes wide open when I was dating him.\u201d</p><p>Not believing a human guy could be such a jerk, Jake shook his head and walked her to her car. \u201cHe still must have been crazy. I take it he didn\u2019t go back to her after you divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He was seeing other women while we were married. He liked them new and different. Once he\u2019d been with a woman for a few weeks, the spark was gone, and he was ready to discard her for someone else. Much like he was with his expensive toys. When his motorcycle was nearly a year old, he ditched it for a new one. When his computer was six months old, he needed something newer that was just on the market. Cell phones, you name it. He was always in debt up to his hairline.\u201d</p><p>For an instant, Jake thought he saw sadness in her posture, as she sat with her shoulders slightly slumped and her eyes averted from the mountain vista. She quickly shrugged as if it didn\u2019t matter and cast him a small smile. \u201cI was lucky to be rid of him.\u201d</p><p>But her words and her actions gave her away. None of what Harold had done mattered as much as the fact the jerk had lusted after other women when he had given his promise to Alicia to be her one and only.</p><p>Jake tried not to see anything more in his relationship with Alicia than serving as her protector until he could convince her to give up the nonsense of taking these men to jail. But he had the sneaking suspicion her past relationship with Harold colored her perception of all men\u2014that they were rats and couldn\u2019t be trusted\u2014and she probably viewed Jake in the same way. It shouldn\u2019t have mattered, but the wolf side of him wanted to exclaim that his kind did not make light of relationships. Although since she was human, he couldn\u2019t admit how faithful his kind were when they made a commitment to their own.</p><p>Telling himself it was for the benefit of the Italian guy watching them to see how he and Alicia parted company, he gave her a see-you-soon kiss. He had hoped she would deepen the kiss, but she didn\u2019t encourage anything more than a quick meeting of the lips, as if she was already putting the brakes on their relationship. That again made him think she was playing her part for the mobster, and Jake worried she might still be planning on ditching him. But then he reconsidered. She seemed honest about wanting to meet him again for lunch.</p><p>He opened her car door for her. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at one then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm-hmm.\u201d She smiled, but her expression was strained.</p><p>If he\u2019d acted on his wolf instincts, he wouldn\u2019t have let her run off on her own, and as soon as he shut the door, he had the resounding feeling that letting her go had been a grave mistake.</p><p>She pulled out of the parking space and headed down the street, then stopped at a floral shop. After making sure she got inside the shop all right and that no one was following her, he returned to his truck to leave his artwork off at the gallery. But he was plagued by the niggling worry that he should follow her and make sure she stayed safe.</p><p>Figuring he could drop off his photography quickly and then tail Alicia until their luncheon engagement, he rushed into the gallery and startled a woman, her blue eyes wide, who was wearing a conservative suit and had her hair cut short in a professional bob.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m Jake Silver, with the photographs I called about displaying in your gallery.\u201d He spoke quickly and as if he was on edge.</p><p>He hoped his smile looked sincere and that he didn\u2019t sound as rushed as he felt as he stalked inside with his box-load of framed artwork. He was ready to drop the photographs on a table and head out again. But by the way the woman\u2019s mouth dropped open, he was sure she was wondering why they\u2019d agreed to carry his photographs in the gallery in the first place.</p><p>He hurried to make his excuses as his thoughts remained on the florist shop and his next destination\u2014tailing Alicia Greiston to keep her safe.</p><p>Totally rattled by Jake Silver, the most dangerously disarming hunk she\u2019d ever caught the attention of, Alicia had missed her chance to follow Mario. She knew that had been Jake\u2019s intent, although she realized he had been right in warning her to use caution. But she didn\u2019t want Mario to get away with murder, and she was determined to make him pay. It had nothing to do with the bond money either, although with a million-dollar bond on Mario\u2019s head, ten percent wasn\u2019t a bad day\u2019s wages. Even though she\u2019d been tracking him for months to be ready in the event that he skipped his court date. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The opportunity lost for the moment, she\u2019d have to pick up his trail later. After buying a wreath of pink, peach, cream, and lavender blossoms at the floral shop down the street, she drove to the hiking trail where her mother had been murdered, intending to pay her respects like she did once a week, no matter what else was going on with her life.</p><p>Although the conversation she was going to have with her mother today wasn\u2019t her usual kind.</p><p>She still felt angry that her mother had to die in the prime of her life and that she hadn\u2019t heeded Alicia\u2019s warnings. Alicia was driven with the need to avenge her mother\u2019s death and saddened by missing her so. But this time a man she didn\u2019t even know had made her feel something different. More alive than she\u2019d felt in years. Distracted from her mission.</p> <p>Neither of her former husbands had made her feel the way Jake had with his heroics and sizzling kisses. Never had her body melted into a pool of ecstasy from the simple touch of a man\u2019s fingers at her back as he guided her outside or from the way he looked as though he wanted to eat her for dessert\u2014her treat\u2014after he\u2019d so gallantly paid for her breakfast.</p><p>He was dangerous, all right. And armed!</p><p>She\u2019d joked about it, but she\u2019d really been flattered she could arouse him that much just by kissing him back. Of course, she told herself that she was only doing what she had to do to prove to Mario\u2019s breakfast companion that she truly did know Jake intimately and had backup if she needed it. But the way Jake had reacted showed he was playing the game for keeps\u2014at least for an overnight tryst, she assumed. Even though she suspected he was not the kind of person who frittered away hours doing inconsequential things. Neither was she. Her mother had always said she was way too serious. But for Alicia, it had been a case of survival.</p><p>Still, after her two husbands and a number of no-account boyfriends, for the first time ever, Alicia was really feeling something for a man\u2014just because of the kind and interested way Jake had treated her.</p><p>Alicia parked at the trailhead, changed out of her heels, and slipped on a pair of tennis shoes. Then, with the fragrant wreath in hand, she hiked along Spruce Creek Trail to where her mother had died, the summer breeze twisting tendrils of hair around Alicia\u2019s cheek and the sweet scent of pine drifting to her.</p> <p>As she often did on the hike, Alicia thought about her mother, Missy Greiston, taking this very path as she started the trek to the Upper and Lower Mohawk Lakes to meet her lover at Continental Falls. Alicia had been there before and loved seeing the crystal water cascade in a foaming rush diagonally down a wildflower-blanketed hillside with alpine woods all around and abandoned mining cabins scattered over the area. But her mother had never made it that day. The macabre truth was that Tony Thomas, her mother\u2019s lover, had been left for dead long before Missy would have reached his location.</p><p>Alicia thought about the times she and her mother had gone skiing on the mountain together\u2014intermediate blue trails, not black-diamond expert runs for them, unless they skied onto them by accident. And they had done that a few times. They had laughed as they tried to make their way down the steep trails, taking one difficult mogul at a time. Stopping, skiing to the next one, and hoping they\u2019d make it to the bottom without breaking their necks. Vowing never again to get on another expert slope. Until they made the same mistake later on a different black-diamond expert slope.</p><p>Alicia swallowed hard, hating that she still missed her mother so much and wishing that her mother had listened to her, believed her when Alicia had told her she thought the man her mother had been dating might be a mobster and dangerous to associate with.</p><p>She soon stood in the thick forested area where hikers had found Missy\u2019s body and notified police. Despite it having been months earlier, Alicia still felt as though the murder had taken place only yesterday. She took a deep breath, having to make a confession to her mother. One she really didn\u2019t want to make.</p><p>\u201cMomma,\u201d she said in a hush, crouching to place the flowers beneath a tree, \u201cI\u2019ve tracked down the family that killed you. Mario Constantino was the one who ordered the hit. Danny Massaro was the man who pulled the trigger. The judge set them free while awaiting trial, so they can eat in fancy restaurants, drink their fancy drinks, and have their fancy women.\u201d</p><p>More strands of hair pulled loose from Alicia\u2019s bun, flipping across her eyes. She snagged them and then slipped them behind her ear.</p> <p>\u201cBut the one, Danny Massaro? He\u2019s already skipped his trial, so as soon as I can manage, I\u2019m turning him in to the police. Once Mario misses his trial date, I\u2019ll re-arrest him, too. I swore to you...\u201d Alicia swallowed hard. \u201cI swore to you I\u2019d make them pay.\u201d</p><p>A tear and then another slid down her cheek, and she hastily brushed them away. \u201cI\u2019ve been...\u201d She wiped away a couple of more tears. \u201cI\u2019ve been missing you something awful. Everything reminds me of you\u2014the little tea shop on Main Street that we used to eat at, even that Victorian restaurant, Victoriana, across the street from the art gallery.\u201d Her throat felt clogged with tears.</p><p>\u201cI... I followed Mario into that restaurant this morning. Our restaurant. The bastard,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut I met someone else there today. And... well, it made me think of something other than revenge for a change.\u201d</p><p>That made her feel guilty. How could she think about a man as beguiling as Jake Silver and how nice it would be to date someone like him, when she had a promise to fulfill?</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a while as she looked up at the wisp of clouds dotting the blue sky. She thought about how this was just like the kind of day she used to enjoy on nature walks with her mother and how her meeting with Jake would have been a godsend, if not for what Mario and Danny had done to her mother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019d approve of him.\u201d Alicia gave a sad little laugh. \u201cYou never really liked any of the guys I dated, and no wonder. They were all losers. But Jake, well, he seems different somehow. Dangerous in a good way.\u201d She stood and took a shaky breath. \u201cYou know what a mess I\u2019ve always made of my life when it comes to guys.\u201d Just like her mother\u2019s relationships with men.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to say. Only that Jake made me realize I wasn\u2019t totally dead like I thought I was. But it scares me. Not only because my past relationships were such disasters, but also what if I fall for someone like Jake, and Mario or his thugs kill him, too?\u201d</p><p>She knew they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make her hurt even more than she did now. She folded her arms around herself and rubbed them, suddenly feeling a chill. She\u2019d already lost her mother to these men. She didn\u2019t want them killing anyone else she felt something for.</p> <p>As much as she wanted to have lunch with Jake later and see him further, she couldn\u2019t. For now, men and relationships were out of the question. Deep down, she knew that. Knew she couldn\u2019t keep their \u201cdate.\u201d That was why she\u2019d had to slip away from him back in town. To get away from his enticing presence so she could think clearly again.</p><p>Car doors slammed near where she\u2019d parked, and her whole body tensed with worry. Turning to look, she watched the path for some time until a dark-haired man and a blond woman\u2014hand in hand, and both wearing shorts and T-shirts\u2014appeared, strolling along the hiking trail with their backpacks bulging. Alicia took a relieved breath.</p><p>They looked at her with odd expressions. The suit jacket and skirt and sneakers probably puzzled them until they saw the memorial wreath propped up by the tree and murmured greetings as they walked by her.</p><p>Unless they were out-of-towners, they\u2019d probably heard about her mother\u2019s murder. Many people knew about the flowers she set out each week on the spot where her mother had been murdered. Someone always took away the spent flowers before she returned. At least, that\u2019s what she told herself. If someone was stealing her mother\u2019s flowers after Alicia left, she hoped they put them to good use.</p><p>The hiking couple had long since disappeared along the path and through the woods. Alicia was about to say her good-byes to her mother so she could go back to town and try to catch up with Mario again, when two more car doors slammed shut in the parking area. Hikers, more than likely. Still, she watched the path with apprehension, waiting for their appearance, unbuttoning her jacket in case she had to get to her gun, and hoping some of Mario\u2019s henchmen weren\u2019t coming to pay their last respects.</p><p>Mary Clebourne identified herself as the gallery owner. She\u2019d frowned at Jake\u2019s brusque greeting and jumped when he set the box of photographs on the desk a little too firmly.</p><p>He quickly said, \u201cPrice them however you see fit. I\u2019d planned to meet with you earlier this morning when you were supposed to be open, but I\u2019ve got another commitment right now.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to gather her wits and frowned even deeper. \u201cWe need you to sign some paperwork and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll return later today,\u201d Jake said, heading for the door. It wasn\u2019t like him to let his imagination get away from him, but after the thug had threatened Alicia in the restaurant, Jake couldn\u2019t quit worrying about her.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d the woman said.</p><p>Jake let the door swing shut on his departure as he rushed to his truck. He glanced up the street at the floral shop and noted that Alicia\u2019s car was no longer parked there. Hell.</p><p>With his truck in gear, he tore off down the street and jammed on his brakes in a parking spot at the floral shop. Barely shutting his vehicle\u2019s door, he stalked into the fragrant, refrigerated store where bouquets of flowers and pots of plants resting on terra-cotta tiles decorated four-tier circular shelves.</p><p>Dressed in a blouse and skirt covered in red roses, a gray-haired woman smiled in greeting, dimples appearing on her full cheeks. \u201cMay I help you, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman came in here wearing a black suit, her hair dark brown, and... her name is Alicia Greiston. I need to track her down.\u201d He sounded as desperate as he felt.</p><p>The smile instantly fell from the florist\u2019s face, and a grave sadness marred her appearance. But she hesitated to say where she might think Alicia had gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe met at the restaurant down the street for breakfast. Some guy was trying to strong-arm her out of the restaurant. I stopped him. Alicia and I are to meet later for lunch, but after I dropped off my photographs at the art gallery, I worried that the thug who had been bothering her might have followed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man? Oh.\u201d Her brows knit together in a deep frown. \u201cYou were at Cliffside Art Gallery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You can ask Mary Clebourne. I dropped off some photographs of wildflowers just now.\u201d</p> <p>The woman still hesitated, but her frown lessened some. He figured she was probably thinking that any man who photographed wildflowers couldn\u2019t be all bad.</p><p>\u201cI need to make sure she\u2019s all right,\u201d he added.</p><p>The woman chewed on her upper lip and then said, \u201cShe bought flowers for her mother, Missy Greiston. The murder shocked everyone here in Breckenridge several months back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder?\u201d He frowned, the bits and pieces he knew about Alicia and her mother swirling around in his thoughts. Why hadn\u2019t Alicia mentioned that her mother had been murdered locally? He supposed it wasn\u2019t the thing to talk about when just meeting someone. On the other hand, he suspected she hadn\u2019t wanted him to know.</p><p>\u201cOh my, yes. It was dreadfully awful. Mrs. Greiston had bought plants from me from time to time, whenever she and her daughter, Alicia, came to Breckenridge. They both really loved flowers.\u201d The woman cleared her throat and narrowed her eyes. \u201cNo one has pinned the crime on anyone yet.\u201d</p> <p>Jake remembered what the waitress, Tami, had said. Alicia\u2019s mother had been dating a mobster. Like mother, like daughter. But had Alicia been dating a mobster? Or was that just a way for Tami to convince Jake not to get involved with Alicia?</p><p>\u201cAlicia\u2019s at a cemetery?\u201d he asked in a hurry.</p><p>\u201cNo. Alicia goes to the place where Missy Greiston died. It\u2019s the trailhead at Spruce Creek Trail, two miles south of town. And it has a well-marked parking area.\u201d She sketched him a map. \u201cIt\u2019s not far from here. And she just left. If you hurry, you should be able to catch her still there. Don\u2019t tell her, but... I always remove the spent flowers before she returns at the end of the week. I don\u2019t want her to see how sad the wilted wreaths look upon her return.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded, said a quick \u201cThanks\u201d and grabbed the map. He hurried out of the shop, the whole while wondering if Missy Greiston\u2019s murder had to do with Alicia following a bunch of mobsters. Hell, the woman had to have a death wish.</p><p>Maybe that wasn\u2019t so far from the truth.</p><p>Driving way over the speed limit and glad there weren\u2019t any cops or much traffic to delay him, Jake soon reached the site on the map. His thudding heart nearly quit when he saw not only Alicia\u2019s red car and a couple of others, but one of the black Mercedes he was sure he\u2019d seen parked at the restaurant. It was now sitting beside her car, too. And the occupant or occupants were already on the move.</p> <p>Jake dashed out of his truck and sprinted up the heavily forested trail, hoping to hell he wasn\u2019t too late. Gunfire sounded, and another surge of adrenaline rushed through his veins. He had to shift. He didn\u2019t have any weapons on him, and he had no other way to protect Alicia against gun-wielding tyrants, if she was being targeted, except as a wolf. After dodging off the trail, he quickly jerked off his clothes and willed himself to shift.</p><p>With anger and frustration overwhelming him, he felt the heat already pouring into his veins grow even hotter with the shift as his body changed from a human form to his wolf body, complete with fur coat, raised hackles, and wickedly menacing teeth. He tore off after the men with a red rage filling his heart, ready to kill and praying that Alicia was still alive.</p><p>As he bounded forth, he saw one man ahead on the hiking trail, clasping his leg, writhing on the ground, and cursing a blue streak. Gun in hand, another man was trying to lift his companion. To Jake\u2019s astonishment, he noticed as a whiff of gun smoke drifted to him that Alicia\u2019s gun was aimed at the crouching man. Her brows were furrowed and her eyes narrowed in contempt at the two men.</p><p>Jake stopped, momentarily stunned that she\u2019d defended herself and come out on top, although the gunman could still shoot her. Jake growled low and deep, the urge to kill racing through his blood.</p><p>All three of them turned to look at him, the groaning man bleeding, eyes wide with fear, and the other gunman\u2019s eyes just as huge. The standing man was the one who had threatened Alicia in the restaurant, and his words came back to Jake: \u201cJust so\u2019s you know, next time, you won\u2019t get off so easy.\u201d</p><p>At least his partner didn\u2019t look like he was going to get off so easy.</p><p>Alicia\u2019s mouth had dropped open several degrees when she saw Jake in his wolf form, and her dark chocolate eyes were now nearly black.</p><p>If she\u2019d been in mortal danger, Jake wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to end the thugs\u2019 miserable lives. But if he did kill them, a hunt would ensue for a gray wolf who was a man-killer, and any gray wolf would be a prime suspect. Despite his noble intentions, he was sure Alicia would think he was an evil wolf from childhood tales.</p> <p>The thug fired at Jake, but he had anticipated the move and dodged back into the woods. \u201cKill her,\u201d the injured man said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cAim your gun in my direction, and I\u2019ll have to shoot you in a location that\u2019s a lot more fatal,\u201d Alicia warned the man threatening her with his weapon, her voice terse, her hands steady on the gun.</p><p>Jake watched from the cover of the woods, ready to come to her rescue if she needed him, when the sound of a group of men talking and laughing and heading in Alicia\u2019s and the armed men\u2019s direction caught everyone\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cGet up,\u201d the uninjured man said to the other. \u201cHurry, we gotta get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill her,\u201d the injured man insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnother day,\u201d the other promised. He holstered his gun and then helped the wounded man to his feet as he cursed and groaned. Then they headed back the way they had come, the injured one walking with a pronounced limp as blood soaked his trouser leg.</p><p>Before the four men walking in Alicia\u2019s direction were in sight, Alicia had tucked her gun away, but she glanced warily toward the woods where Jake had taken off. He stayed hidden in the pines and continued to observe her until the hikers reached her.</p><p>When the four men saw her, they greeted her, looking her over and probably trying to figure out why two men and a woman were wearing business suits there, and one of the men appeared injured. The hikers glanced at the memorial wreath she\u2019d laid at the foot of a tree, expressed condolences, and continued on their way, a couple of them looking over their shoulders in her direction. Her focus remained on the path in the direction of the parking area.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the one whose mother was murdered in the woods,\u201d the one said to the others in a low voice, but with his enhanced hearing, Jake heard.</p><p>\u201cWhat about those two guys?\u201d another asked.</p><p>\u201cI told you I heard gunfire,\u201d the first said.</p><p>\u201cThink she shot the guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was hard to say, but the way he was limping and the other guy was trying to help him along the path, I\u2019d say it was a good bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her.\u201d</p><p>Their conversation trailed off as they hiked on the path deeper into the woods.</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t like that she was trying to put Mario Constantino and Danny Massaro behind bars on her own, that they\u2019d gotten away with murder, and that she appeared to be all alone in the world. But getting into human affairs was one of the things his kind didn\u2019t do. That didn\u2019t stop him from wanting to do something, though, where she was concerned.</p><p>Satisfied she\u2019d be all right until he could return to her, he raced through the woods to where he\u2019d left his clothes, then shape-shifted and dressed. When he was again on the hikers\u2019 trail, he stalked back with a hurried stride to Alicia\u2019s location to intercept her.</p><p>She was beautiful and sexy with the breeze tugging at her bun and more tendrils of her dark hair caressing her cheeks. Her jacket had been left open, and her silk blouse was now visible. She looked sensuously undone.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d Alicia said breathlessly as soon as she saw him. She was still standing in the same spot near the wreath of flowers, looking tense and anxious, and he assumed she was waiting until she presumed the thugs had left in their car. But as soon as she caught sight of Jake, she moved toward him, appearing glad to see him and a little shaken.</p><p>He quickened his pace, trying to keep his expression neutral. But he was angry\u2014furious with the bastards who had threatened her and none too happy with Alicia for dismissing him when he knew something like this could happen. Not to mention annoyed with himself for not forcing the issue and staying with her.</p><p>His eyes trailed down her body, but she didn\u2019t appear to have been hurt. He took her hands and drew her into his arms. She trembled, and tears appeared in her eyes before she melted against him.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked, his voice a lot rougher than he\u2019d intended as one arm curled around her waist and his free hand rubbed her back reassuringly.</p><p>She nodded, looked back at the wreath as if she was saying her good-byes to her mother, and then said with a shaky voice, \u201cI\u2019ve... I\u2019ve never shot a man before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll live,\u201d Jake said with sincere regret.</p><p>She walked with him in the direction of the parking lot. \u201cHow did you know where to find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched you enter the florist shop before I dropped my work off at the art gallery. I was worried that the man who hassled you at the restaurant might try again.\u201d He took her hand and interlocked his fingers with hers. Her fingers tightened over his in a welcoming manner. \u201cDo you live in Breckenridge?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like the idea that she might be in danger if she lived in the area and these thugs had easy access to her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m staying at a hotel for a few days. Just doing a job.\u201d</p><p>He stopped and looked down at her, his brow deeply furrowed. \u201cYou aren\u2019t just doing a job.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her chin lifted a little in defiance, her dark brown eyes narrowing. No argument there, which meant he was correct in his assumption. He had to remind himself she wasn\u2019t a wolf. That she didn\u2019t have a pack. That it shouldn\u2019t matter what a human female had in mind to do.</p><p>But family took care of family. The thought kept nagging at him\u2014where was her family? A father? Siblings? Anyone else? Why was she after these men all on her own? Why wasn\u2019t anyone keeping tabs on her?</p><p>He assumed the judge had set a bail bond low enough that the men had been able to post bail. If they had skipped their court dates, as she assumed, she would be in danger while she trailed them.</p> <p>\u201cAdmit it. Mario and the other man you mentioned, Danny Massaro, murdered your mother. It\u2019s a vendetta,\u201d he said quietly, but the undercurrent of warning was there. What she was doing was wrong, and it could get her killed.</p><p>\u201cNot a vendetta,\u201d she said icily. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to gun them down like they did my mother. Just return them to jail where they belong. Permanently.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull her hand free from his, but he wouldn\u2019t let go. With his free hand, he swept the back of his hand down her cheek with a tender caress. \u201cAll right, not a vendetta then.\u201d But he still couldn\u2019t see how she planned to safely take these men into custody.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure just what about her made his pulse race to such an extent, the way the heat of her hand penetrated his, the way he couldn\u2019t put her out of his mind, stirring a need to be with her and to protect her that he was having a hard time quelling. The expression on her face, though rebellious, appealed to him. Hell, everything about her did.</p><p>Her short-waisted suit jacket hung open as if she\u2019d been ready to remove it to dress in a more casual manner. But he knew that had to do with her having easy access to her gun, although the holstered weapon was still hidden. His gaze drifted down to where the ice-white silken blouse revealed the faint outline of her bra and a hint of lace, baring the sexier side of her outfit. Round pearl-button fasteners on her blouse captured his attention, and briefly, he wanted to touch them, to poke one after another through the slivers of their buttonholes, to see the rest of her as nature had intended.</p> <p>She cleared her throat, and he returned his gaze to her face. A small smile tugged at her lips, and her brows lifted in a way that said she knew exactly where his thoughts had roamed.</p><p>Although he wanted this issue between them resolved\u2014wanted her to promise him she wasn\u2019t going any further with this futile effort to take down these men, when her hand rested on his shirt-covered chest, the vest now open and most of his shirt still unbuttoned because of hastily dressing, he thought she was going to push him away. Or at least try.</p><p>But her hand swept up his chest as if tentatively feeling the muscles beneath the shirt, memorizing the sensation of him, and judging his reaction, while her eyes focused on his chest as she continued to explore. Her touch left a trail of sizzling heat through the cotton shirt and a craving to touch her in the same way, except that he wanted to touch her skin to skin.</p><p>He lifted her chin and leaned down and kissed her. Potent need filled him as his mouth conquered hers, possessing and wanting, the worry that she could have come to harm still making his blood pulse hot and hard. His hands slid underneath the back of her jacket, gliding over the silky blouse while her head still tilted up to encourage his onslaught. Instantly responsive, she reacted as though she needed his comfort, his possessiveness, him, as she molded to his body, pressing harder against him, her hands exploring his back through the dress shirt with eagerness.</p><p>If they\u2019d been back home in his own woods, away from civilization, free to do what they pleased, he would have liked to take her, conquer her, make love to her. It wasn\u2019t just sex that he was interested in having with Alicia either, but something deeper. Although he knew he couldn\u2019t go there with her, not when she was human, and he had no intention of turning her.</p><p>With his thoughts shifting to his more primal needs, he barely registered that they were still standing on the path where hikers could come upon them at any moment. He wasn\u2019t familiar with these woods or how frequently visitors to the area might slip off the path and do some exploring on their own. Still, he wanted more, wanted her. And his baser, more primitive instinct told him she was just as willing as he was. To go with the moment, to find pleasure where they could.</p> <p>But was Alicia truly as willing?</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Jake pulled Alicia off the hiking trail and deeper into the woods, kissing her mouth and stroking her back while walking backward as she continued to press herself against him, pursuing him and getting caught up in the moment.</p><p>When she wrenched his shirt free from his jeans, he knew she was thinking along the same intimate lines he was. He broke free of the kiss, then slid his hand around hers and hauled her even deeper into the woods, far away from the beaten path. He was glad he\u2019d moved her from the trail when the distant conversation of more hikers walking along it drifted to them.</p><p>Finally he and Alicia reached a secluded enough spot in the forest, surrounded by tall, slender quaking aspens, their leaves twisting and bending in a fluttering dance to the tune of a warm, dry breeze and issuing a softly whispering rustle. He took a deep breath of the fragrance of the towering ponderosa pine trees, with their subtle vanilla-scented bark, although unless a human stood close to the tree bark, he or she probably couldn\u2019t smell it like a wolf could.</p><p>The trees creaked as a sturdy wind shook them. Pine needles rained down in a wistful shower to the forest floor, which was already coated with fallen leaves and pine needles of seasons past. The woods were dark and shady as birds flitted around on the nearby tree branches. Other than the sounds of the breeze in the trees and the twittering of the birds, the place was a perfect depiction of tranquility and beauty. Especially with Alicia in the picture.</p><p>He almost wished he had his camera to capture the timeless beauty. But this was all too private and personal, and he wanted to capture the image of her like this for his sake only.</p><p>He stopped and looked down at her. She gazed up at him with smoldering eyes, hot and sexy and dark with desire. He reached up, unfastened the copper clip confining her hair on top of her head, and watched with fascination as the dark chocolate curls cascaded over her shoulders. Having imagined tons of pins confining her hair, he was glad that releasing it was this easy.</p> <p>He tucked the clip into his shirt pocket, feeling as though he\u2019d claimed one of the enchantress\u2019s treasures, forever binding her to him, as she smiled a little at the gesture. He combed his fingers through the luscious, heavy, satiny strands of hair as her fingers rested momentarily on his hips. She watched him as he luxuriated in the feel of her curls.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling his face in a handful of her curls. He breathed in the lightly perfumed scent and then leaned down to kiss her forehead with a lingering touch.</p><p>\u201cHmm, likewise,\u201d she murmured back, slipping her hands up the front of his shirt, her fingers brushing through his light chest hair, feeling his muscles, then sweeping across his nipples.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, sounding nearly desperate to keep going.</p><p>He sucked in a breath, the heady feeling she created in him making him pause briefly to savor every whisper-soft touch of her roving fingertips, his body tight with anticipation. When she slipped her hands free of his shirt and began working on his buttons, he reached down and pulled her blouse free of her skirt. He\u2019d only just begun the arduous job of trying to push a round pearl button through the tiny slit of a buttonhole on her blouse when she finished unbuttoning his shirt.</p><p>She slowly peeled his shirt off his shoulders, taking the vest with it at the same time, sliding it lower until the shirt and vest rested midway down his biceps. He expected her to pull them both off, but instead, she held the shirt and vest in place, keeping him hostage as she leaned close and licked one nipple, then the other. The warm wind sweeping across his wet nipples created an arousing tingling he\u2019d never experienced before, and he groaned with need at the sensation, wanting to do the same with Alicia. And much, much more.</p><p>More than the way her kissing and licking his nipples into ecstasy was affecting him, he was intrigued by the fact she was controlling him, holding him hostage. No woman he had ever been with had done such a thing to him. After one last gentle pull on each nipple with her hot sensuous lips, she finally lifted her gaze to his and smiled, the skin beneath her dark thick lashes crinkling slightly, her eyes sparkling with genuine delight. He cupped the back of her head and angled his mouth over hers, his shirt and vest still positioned in the middle of his biceps and keeping him from having a full range of motion. The confined sensation made him even harder and more desirous, and Alicia more desirable.</p><p>He plunged his tongue into her mouth and tangled with her own very willing tongue. Then she finally pulled his shirt and vest downward, forcing him to drop his hands away from cupping her head, their mouths still linked in a mating dance. After she yanked the shirt and vest free and deposited them on the ground, his hands went to her blouse buttons. But again, she thwarted him when she slipped her jacket off her shoulders and then tossed it on top of his shirt. His fingers returned to her buttons, finally managing to undo one, but then continued to struggle with the second one. Hell, at this rate, he\u2019d take all day to get her out of the blouse, and he was ready to just yank a bunch of buttons off it instead.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me do it,\u201d she said, sensing his frustration, her hands clasping his with a gentle reassuring touch, her voice softly reaching his ears, although his lust-filled brain was having a hard time deciphering anything but the need to have her naked and in his arms.</p><p>He eagerly gave in to her suggestion and reached around her back to locate the zipper on her skirt. But after running his hand around the back of her waistband, he couldn\u2019t locate the fastener.</p><p>\u201cSide zipper,\u201d she said, indicating with her elbow which side as she continued to unfasten her blouse.</p><p>He noticed she was having a hard time with the buttons, too. The thought occurred to him that if she were a wolf, the blouse would not have been part of her wardrobe as it would be too difficult to remove in a hurry if she needed to shift. But her skirt zipper easily parted for him, and she was soon wiggling a little as he pulled the skirt down her hips. Then she stepped out of the garment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No slip, no hose. He stared at the pair of skimpy bikini panties she wore, the top edged in lace, and her bare shapely legs. He thought of the contrast between the business clothes she was wearing and the sensual silk and lace underneath. No matter what she wore from now on, he would always envision how sexy she was beneath the professional exterior.</p><p>She finally freed herself of the blouse and raised a brow, noticing that he was so distracted that he hadn\u2019t yet pulled off his trousers. Yeah, he was distracted all right, his gaze focused on her creamy skin, confined only in the scraps of lace\u2014a white bra and panties\u2014and a pair of trim leather walking shoes, also white.</p><p>Breaking free of his fascination, he quickly divested himself of most of the rest of his clothes. First went his boots, then the socks and jeans. Before he stripped out of his boxers, he crouched to untie her tennis shoes, giving her calves each a kiss while he was at it.</p> <p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d he said again. The woman was all pleasing curves, silky skin, and alluring fragrance.</p><p>Her fingers combed through his hair while he pulled off her shoes, making his body react with ardent need. The bra and panties and his boxers were piled on top of the rest of their clothes, and he admired the fullness of her breasts and the dusky color of her aroused nipples. Dark curly hair covered her mons, and her long shapely legs caught his imagination as he considered how he would feel with them wrapped around his waist as he plunged deeply into her.</p><p>He looked up to see her taking her fill of him, too. Her lingering perusal on his erection made him all the hotter for her, and he took her hands as he sat on the leafy forest floor, pulling her down on top of him in a sitting position to protect her delicate skin. Straddling him, she leaned forward to kiss him, her ripe womanly folds splayed to him, her breasts hanging down like tempting fruit.</p><p>He cupped her breasts as she kissed his mouth, her pelvis rubbing against his arousal, which was agonizingly ready for her. Slipping his fingers between them, he stroked the sweet spot between her thighs. She arched her back, her eyes closing, her lips parted as she panted with pleasure, her curls already dewy with expectation. She rested her hands on the ground as she leaned back a little more, barely breathing as he continued to stroke her.</p><p>She moved against him with urgency and desperation, soft moans of satisfaction escaping her lips. Seeing her in the dark pine shadows, opening herself to him with her knees spread wide, he thought only of giving her pleasure. When she gasped his name in a quiet, grateful manner, he slipped his fingers into her wetness, felt the climax hit, the pulsing deep inside her, and nudged himself at her entrance, waiting only long enough to see she was still agreeable.</p> <p>Agreeable, hell. She took charge, centered herself over his erection, and rocked and squirmed on top of him until he was deeply entrenched inside her. He couldn\u2019t believe his fortune to have found a woman who could turn his furnace on high with just a lingering look in his direction, who could make him so completely entranced with her that he nearly forgot his wolf instincts for self-preservation at all costs.</p><p>His hands molded to her voluptuous breasts, her mouth on his, until he felt the world lift from his shoulders. Everything ceased to exist except Alicia: her body, her tongue teasing his, her fingernails flicking lightly over his nipples, and with his erection deep inside her, stroking him, tight and hot and wet, her body melding with him until they were as one.</p><p>Unable to hold off, he came into her with a burst of satisfaction. Climaxing had never felt this good. The overwhelming release sated him, making him experience a wolf\u2019s runner\u2019s high, a sense of being on top of the world, his body on fire with the feel of her snug internal muscles holding him tight. He didn\u2019t want the encounter to end ever.</p><p>He lay down on his back as she continued to sit on top of him, pushing her thick hair away from her face in a sexy way, her heartbeat rapid, her breathing quickened, every inch of her skin flushed with exertion. He could see in her eyes the question forming there. What now? Where do we go from here?</p><p>The thing of it was that he wanted her. Permanently. As a werewolf, the thought was lunacy. If he\u2019d been strictly human, he would have done anything in his power to keep her, to enjoy the way she made him feel for hours, days, weeks, months. But he wasn\u2019t strictly human, and the situation was bound to get more complicated in a hurry.</p><p>She seemed to see the concern he had about them, and with as much grace as was possible as she sat astride him in all her nakedness, she climbed off him. Unable to move or to take his eyes off the wonder that she was, he watched as she slipped on her panties, hiding the dark patch of curly hair that protected her treasures, the enticing shadow still visible through the silky white fabric. White\u2014he thought of innocence and sweetness and vulnerability. The way she\u2019d made love to him, he thought of her wearing red\u2014fiery and hot\u2014rather than the innocence and sweetness of white.</p> <p>She avoided looking at him now, making her the picture of vulnerability. She pulled on the lace bra, her aroused nipples straining against the cups as she reached behind her back to fasten the garment, the dusky areolas holding his gaze like two sensual beacons still visible against the white lace. She continued to avoid looking at him as if she was feeling self-conscious now that the adrenaline rush had subsided.</p><p>But she\u2019d moved him like no one had ever done, and he couldn\u2019t think of anything else but being with her. Hell, he was already thinking about returning with her to her hotel room and having her all over again. And he knew it wouldn\u2019t be the last time he\u2019d want her like that.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ll be going home now.\u201d She still didn\u2019t look at him, even when speaking.</p><p>She lifted her blouse off the ground and shook off the pine needles clinging to it, her voice without inflection, as if the world hadn\u2019t rocked for her as much as it had for him, yet he knew she wasn\u2019t oblivious to what they\u2019d just experienced. He also knew she was pulling away to avoid getting hurt.</p><p>He cursed himself for falling for a human female who intrigued him like no other. Something deeper stirred his interest. Something he couldn\u2019t pinpoint. He\u2019d always known his mind, known the right thing to do as a lupus garou. Now, he was fighting any self-doubts he had that being with her was right\u2014even though, deep down, he knew this was a big mistake.</p><p>He had never slept with a human woman after sex, often didn\u2019t have sex more than once with the same woman, and hadn\u2019t even had sex with one for the past six months. He never got involved with a human woman for more than the sexual act that mutually satisfied them both. Keeping relationships on that basis worked best for lupus garous.</p><p>But in Alicia\u2019s case, he wanted to take a hike with her to one of the lakes, see the falls, share her bed, wake up with her wrapped up in his arms in the morning, and make love to her all over again. He wanted to spend real quality time with her and get to know her in more than just a sexual way. And he didn\u2019t want to analyze why he was feeling that way.</p><p>Despite his better judgment, he ignored her comment, which had as much as said she thought he had just wanted her for the sex and now was leaving her behind. He tucked his arms behind his head. \u201cI\u2019ve only been to Breckenridge the one time. You might know the area better than I do. Anyplace you\u2019d like to go? Hiking? Kayaking? Something else?\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes widened a bit as she pulled on her blouse and began buttoning it. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>He thought from the tone of her voice that she might even be pleased. But her expression was still guarded. His gaze slid down her long bare legs, and again he envisioned her on her back and those shapely legs wrapped around his hips as he entered her again. He blinked, trying to get the image out of his mind.</p><p>\u201cWe could take in a movie. Drive-in preferred if they have any here in Breckenridge.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little at the suggestion, and he swore he could see her thinking like he was\u2014snuggling, kissing, getting hot and bothered in the backseat of his pickup, and forget whatever was playing on the silver screen.</p><p>\u201cYou are serious.\u201d Her expression brightened several degrees. \u201cBut the nearest drive-in is about three hours away.\u201d</p><p>In that moment, she looked innocent again, not at all as though she might imagine the lustful notions he was conjuring up. He took a deep breath. He had it bad.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem fair to her that she didn\u2019t know what her sweet body was doing to his thoughts. Except that his body was already reacting to his lascivious ruminations.</p><p>\u201cI had considered going back with you to your hotel and checking out your accommodations. To make sure they\u2019re safe.\u201d He suggestively waggled his brows, noting that she was having a hard time keeping her gaze focused on his, her eyes considering his physique as if she was amused he was having trouble keeping his bodily reactions under control.</p><p>And that was causing him further difficulty in keeping his mind on the idea of tackling other pursuits with her.</p><p>She smiled wryly at that. \u201cUmm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I\u2019m game for anything else you\u2019d like to do. And we\u2019re still having lunch at the steak place later this afternoon\u2014on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said softly, and tossed his boxers to him.</p><p>He caught them midair and grinned, the utterly wicked gleam in his eye saying he wanted her again. \u201cYou keep looking at me the way you do, and we\u2019ll be here all day and night.\u201d He gave her a lustful wink that said he was game.</p><p>Caught in the act of ogling him way too much, Alicia felt her face heat, and she smiled at Jake, although she hadn\u2019t thought he had noticed her studious appraisal of his sinful body since he was so busy admiring hers. She didn\u2019t recall either of her husbands caring anything about what she looked like after she\u2019d been with them for a while, just as long as she removed her clothes quickly and was ready for them to sate their needs in record time. They had been drunk half the time when she was married to them and just wanted to get the deed done before they passed out.</p><p>But with Jake, it was so different. So right.</p><p>Trying to get her mind off his hunky body and her embarrassment at getting caught perusing him to such a degree, she leaned down to get her skirt. She figured that women were probably always taken in by his arresting looks and he was oblivious to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she could kick herself for agreeing to do anything further with him when she should have been fighting this rabid attraction they had for one another all along. He was so hot. No one she had ever dated had been as sexy or funny or protective as Jake. She\u2019d thought he wouldn\u2019t have been as good \u201cin bed\u201d as he was, that maybe having a fling would make her realize how he was just like her ex-husbands, neither of whom had made the effort to pleasure her.</p><p>She\u2019d thought sex was about the man having all the fun. Not with Jake. Her needs, her arousal came before his own. For the first time ever, she\u2019d really climaxed! She hadn\u2019t faked it. Hadn\u2019t needed to. She could still envision Jake\u2019s fingers entering her, as if he was ensuring she truly had reached the pinnacle before he found release in her. She couldn\u2019t believe he had done that and thought the world of him for it.</p><p>Yet something was holding him back now. A former relationship gone bad, maybe? A man who could have fun for a little while, but commitment wasn\u2019t part of his psyche?</p> <p>It shouldn\u2019t have mattered. She shouldn\u2019t have even gone this far with him. But during the three years since her last divorce, she\u2019d avoided men like the plague. Until she had seen Jake and been drawn to him, probably because he had been intrigued with her from the start and then definitely because of his coming to rescue her in the restaurant. And then coming for her here to protect her if she needed protecting. She\u2019d never known any man to stick his neck out for her. Not her fly-by-night boyfriends or her two ex-husbands, either.</p><p>She blamed her first marital misstep on his and her youth and wanting to get away from her mother and the loser her mother had picked up at the time. The second marital mistake was one of those proverbial on-the-rebound blunders. Both marriages had been over in a flash since she\u2019d married in Texas and they\u2019d been Army guys. Quickie divorces were the thing. Neither of the guys were hero types like she thought a man in uniform should be. Oh sure, many were. But with her luck with men, she\u2019d picked up two that were anything but. Carousing, drinking, all-around losers. She\u2019d attributed it to looking for love in all the wrong places.</p><p>She took a deep breath and zipped up her skirt. Before she could slip on her tennis shoes, Jake was standing before her, wearing only his jeans, his chest deliciously bare, his puckered nipples enticing her all over again. He had her tennis shoes in hand and a silly smirk on his face. He leaned over and kissed her cheek, then crouched in front of her. With her hands on his shoulders to steady herself, she treasured the sensation as he brushed off one of the soles of her feet with the soft dusting of his dress shirt, then slipped her shoe on. Then with equally tender reverence, he did the same with the other. She felt like Cinderella. And cherished.</p><p>Only in this case, she wouldn\u2019t turn into a penniless scullery maid who vied to go to the ball and meet the prince before midnight. Instead, she\u2019d go back to being a bounty hunter who was bound to get her prince killed just by knowing him. That thought continued to nag at her as she tried to think of a way out of this. But she didn\u2019t want out. Damn it. She wanted him. Like she\u2019d never wanted anyone in her life. She chastised herself again. This was insane.</p><p>After he tied her shoes, he rose and tilted her chin up to give her a light kiss on the lips, his eyes studying hers as if he was trying to see into her soul. Then he took a deep breath, slid his fingers down her cheek and her throat, swept them across a breast and the nipple, and then dropped his hand away.</p> <p>He wanted her again, she thought. But not here. In her hotel room. And despite her misgivings, she felt the same way about him.</p><p>Then he left her to tug on his boots. She felt she should return the favor by brushing off his feet with tenderness, but he was already wearing his socks and quickly pulled on his boots. She reached for her gun in its holster and slipped it on, and then her suit jacket.</p><p>She considered what they could do together that might be fairly reasonable and keep them from interacting with the thugs for the time being. She needed a solution that would allow her to spend more time with Jake without putting him danger. Then at some point, she\u2019d slip away from him and do what she\u2019d come here to do in the first place. Locate Danny Massaro and arrest him, then turn him in for the bounty and forget her unreasonable interest in getting to know Jake better. Then if Mario didn\u2019t show up for trial, she\u2019d arrest him, too.</p><p>With that thought in mind, she watched Jake pull on his shirt, hiding that beautiful chest of his, and asked, \u201cIf you\u2019re truly game, how about ice skating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIce skating?\u201d The arch in Jake\u2019s brows and in the tone of his voice made it sound as though ice skating wasn\u2019t a choice he would have ever considered making.</p><p>Alicia didn\u2019t know what to think of him. One minute he was acting like he couldn\u2019t get enough of her, and the next, she could feel him pulling away. Yet his words didn\u2019t fit his actions, as if he was fighting his own feelings.</p> <p>Well, as she\u2019d told her mother, men and relationships never worked out well for either of them. And certainly with Alicia\u2019s plans to return Mario and Danny to prison, starting a relationship could be a deadly business for the unsuspecting guy. She couldn\u2019t do that to Jake. She sighed and pushed her hair behind her ears.</p><p>After he tucked in his shirt, then tugged on his vest, he walked over and put his hands on her shoulders, his thumbs rubbing them and heating her body all over again. A small quiver of need started tingling in her breasts, making them swell, and then moved lower in her belly and even lower between her legs.</p><p>He kissed her lips gently but with real meaning. It was the kind of kiss that meant she wasn\u2019t getting rid of him anytime soon.</p><p>So much for ice skating deterring him.</p><p>Although she still felt he was sending mixed messages. Either he was the master of deception, or he really was fighting with himself over making something more of their relationship. While he was pulling away from her, she was all set to keep this from going too far. But how could she push him away when he kissed her like he loved every inch of her and wanted her for keeps? And when she was afflicted with the same damn desire?</p><p>Some part of her told her she deserved a chance at real love, at real happiness. That she couldn\u2019t screw this up if it was meant to be. But the sensible part of her said she could lose him to violence, and there was no way in hell she was losing someone else she cared about like that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never ice skated before. So you\u2019ll have to teach me how to do it. And I\u2019ll try not to embarrass you too much,\u201d Jake finally said, his thumbs still doing a sensual number on her shoulders.</p><p>Genuinely surprised he\u2019d be game, she laughed a little. She thought of him as cool and collected, never ruffled. The notion of him falling on the ice had never crossed her mind. But again, she figured that ice skating would be one activity where the bad guys wouldn\u2019t bother with them. So Jake would be safe, she was certain.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to help you. But you can hold on to the railing if you need to. That\u2019s what many of the beginners do.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhere you go, I go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I\u2019m doing figure eights?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at that. \u201cI think I\u2019ll opt for staying in the upright position and watching.\u201d</p><p>By spreading their feet on ice and with the fur that protected their pads, wolves were very adept at maneuvering on ice. But as a human, Jake had never ice skated, and if Alicia hadn\u2019t suggested it, he most likely never would have. They agreed to drop by her hotel room so she could change clothes. A business suit on ice wouldn\u2019t work out.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t planned on doing anything but waiting for her to change clothes while he called his brother, Darien, to let him know he\u2019d be a little later arriving home than expected. But the hotel room had one large bed and a bathroom, and Jake\u2019s eyes were riveted on that king-sized bed as if it were the most functionally beautiful piece of furniture in the world. Alicia had slipped out of her suit jacket and gun with holster, hanging them over the back of a desk chair, and pushed off her walking shoes. She entered the bathroom to clean up, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>The shower turned on, and he was still thinking about that bed and what he and Alicia could do in it together when his cell phone rang. He jerked it off his belt, saw the caller was his brother, and shook his head. Jake should have called him first.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Darien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi wanted me to check on you since you said you\u2019d be home right after you dropped off the photographs, and you\u2019re an hour late. Since you\u2019re never late, she was worried. If it were me, I wouldn\u2019t have been concerned. But you know how she\u2019s been recently, what with the babies coming so soon. Having any trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe art gallery didn\u2019t open on time when I first arrived. But other than that, I\u2019m staying longer to sightsee.\u201d He had no intention of telling his older brother he was smitten with a human woman and intended to stay with her through the night at least, hoping he could convince her to give up her quest and find some other scumbag to take down\u2014one who was a lot less dangerous. And then he\u2019d give her up before he got much more entangled with her. \u201cI\u2019ll be home... tomorrow, sometime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Darien said, sounding suspicious.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything wrong?\u201d Darien\u2019s tone was more worried now.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou... don\u2019t... sightsee ever, Jake. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>That was the problem with having an older brother who was the pack leader and who knew Jake too well. \u201cNothing\u2019s up. I needed a bit of a vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vacation.\u201d</p><p>Jake supposed that sounded rather weird to his brother since vacations were not part of Jake\u2019s usual routine. \u201cI\u2019ll be home soon. All right, Darien?\u201d This time his voice said he wasn\u2019t saying anything further, so give it a rest.</p><p>A significant pause followed, and Jake was fairly sure Darien was considering whether to pry further\u2014and give some of his brotherly advice\u2014or just leave it be. Then Darien said, \u201cIs that a shower running in the background?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn their wolf hearing. Jake looked back at the closed door to the bathroom, hearing the spray from the shower hitting the tub in a rush. He should have walked outside the room to take the call, but he hadn\u2019t been thinking. Not while he\u2019d been staring at that inviting bed.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jake didn\u2019t say anything more than that. Only one reason a shower would be running and he wasn\u2019t in it. Someone else was.</p><p>Another very long pause followed. Then Darien finally conceded. \u201cAll right.\u201d He tried to sound gruff, but Jake could hear the hint of a smile in his brother\u2019s voice. \u201cCall us when you\u2019re on your way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Jake turned off his phone and shoved it into his pocket, annoyed with himself for getting caught in the act. Darien was sure to tell his mate, and Lelandi was sure to attempt her matchmaking with Jake again.</p><p>But with Alicia being human... that wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>Jake shook his head, irritated with himself again, but then the shower shut off and his gaze flew to the bathroom door as he imagined a soaking-wet Alicia climbing out of the tub and into his arms.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Darien pulled Lelandi into his arms in the great room of his home, her belly seemingly getting bigger by the second the way the triplets were growing. He kissed her forehead and rubbed her back as she looked up at him.</p> <p>\u201cJake\u2019s all right, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Lelandi asked as Darien led her from the great room toward the stairs.</p><p>She was always worried about Darien, and she worried about his two brothers. He wondered how they had managed to survive before she came into their lives the previous fall. He smiled down at her. \u201cHe\u2019s staying through the night and will let us know when he\u2019s on his way home.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted in surprise.</p><p>Darien shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s taking some vacation time. Then he\u2019s going to do a little sightseeing.\u201d</p><p>Eyes huge, she stared at him. \u201cJake? Your brother Jake?\u201d</p><p>Darien chuckled. \u201cYeah.\u201d He tugged on a red curl. \u201cDo you want me to give you another back rub?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to get tired of giving them to me.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and led her up the stairs to their bedroom. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying our future in there,\u201d he said, running his hand gently over her expanding belly. \u201cAnything I can do to make you feel more comfortable until the babies come and beyond, I\u2019ll do. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s making all the sacrifices, after all.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the room, he shut the door, then helped her out of her stretchy shirt. She rested her hands on his shoulders as he removed her jeans and then her undergarments.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how beautiful you are?\u201d he asked, as he helped her lie down on her side, then tucked the pregnancy pillow under her belly and between her legs to take the pressure off her back.</p><p>He poured some cream onto his hands and warmed it between them before he began to massage her back.</p><p>\u201cHmm, Darien, you\u2019ve said many times how beautiful I am, although I feel like a beached whale.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhat is Jake really doing? Hmm, oh, that feels so good, honey. A little lower if you don\u2019t mind. Yes, to the right... wait, to the left... yes, there.\u201d</p><p>He massaged her lower back and felt the tension ease in her muscles as she continued to purr.</p><p>\u201cHe was with a woman, I venture to guess.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes wide, Lelandi looked over her shoulder at Darien. \u201cA woman? Are you sure?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cWell, the shower was running, and he wasn\u2019t in it. The fact he\u2019s sightseeing when he never does sure sounds to me like he\u2019s holed up in a hotel room with a woman.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi turned her head back to the pillow and didn\u2019t say anything as Darien continued to massage her back. Finally she said, \u201cHe never sees a woman socially beyond a strictly mutual sexual encounter because of what we are. If he\u2019s sightseeing with her, does it mean she\u2019s one of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until he\u2019s ready to tell us. But if she\u2019s not one of us, I\u2019m sure he just intends to stay with her tonight and return after that.\u201d He had no intention of second-guessing the situation.</p><p>Lelandi was quiet. Darien knew her matchmaking mind was at it again.</p><p>\u201cWhat about that woman... the one you said called here looking for Jake, but he hadn\u2019t given her his number. Would it be her, do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSherry Slate, the lawyer? Jake told me if he had wanted her to have his number, he would have given her his private one. She must have done some research to come up with my name and number in an attempt to get hold of him. He told me she was a nice woman but not his type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who was she then?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed Lelandi\u2019s shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019s a partner in a law firm in Denver. She met Jake at that art gallery in Denver where he dropped off some of his photographs. If you remember, he was late coming home that time, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one told me that was the reason. I assumed he got hung up in Denver traffic or something.\u201d</p><p>Darien shrugged. \u201cThere was nothing to it, so no need to discuss it with anyone. She was a frequent purchaser at the art gallery. Modern art, though. Not the kind of work Jake does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Lelandi said with speculation.</p><p>\u201cI really doubt it\u2019s the lawyer. It may be just a fling with a human, Lelandi. I wouldn\u2019t make anything of it.\u201d He began rubbing her shoulders, kneading out the tension.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been with a woman in a very long time, you told me. And he never stays with one overnight. It sounds to me that she might be a lupus garou.\u201d Lelandi smiled and snuggled tighter against her pillow. \u201cIf he\u2019s found his mate, then I only have to work on Tom.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Darien shook his head. \u201cTom\u2019s bound and determined to wait for his dream mate. After I found you, he said he wanted to find a woman like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if he doesn\u2019t find one that way, I\u2019ll have to help him along. Is Jake bringing the woman he\u2019s with home to us soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything more than I\u2019ve told you. And even that\u2019s circumstantial. He might have just been getting ready to take his own shower.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at Darien, looking as though she was annoyed he\u2019d ruin her hopeful news. \u201cBut...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he be staying at a hotel in the first place? When I asked him about the shower running, he acknowledged it was but wouldn\u2019t say anything further. If he\u2019d been getting ready to take a shower, he would have hurried to end the conversation. But he wasn\u2019t. As if he was waiting for someone to get out first.\u201d</p><p>He massaged some more as Lelandi took a deep breath. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t he in the shower with her then?\u201d</p><p>Darien chuckled. \u201cHow would I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, well, it sounds to me as if he\u2019s working his way up to things... which makes it sound like she\u2019s a lupus garou. If she were human, he\u2019d just get on with business and be out of there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>She ignored him. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even want to go to Breckenridge. Guess he\u2019s changed his mind now. I wonder who she is.\u201d</p><p>Poor Jake. If Lelandi had anything to do with it, she\u2019d have him mated to the woman before he knew what hit him.</p><p>The shower curtain slid aside and Jake\u2019s attention remained focused on the closed bathroom door. He envisioned Alicia\u2019s silky skin covered in water droplets and licking every one of them off.</p><p>Before he could give much more thought to the matter, she opened the door to the bathroom, letting the steam out. Dressed only in a skimpy bath towel, she stood in the doorway for a moment looking at him and seeming a little hesitant.</p><p>\u201cIs something the matter?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>She twisted her mouth a little and shook her head. \u201cI forgot to get a change of clothes.\u201d Her brows elevated a bit when his eyes shifted from her body to her face. But still she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Wrapped in the towel, she was beautiful. Her dark hair was dry except for the ends that were dripping wet. The towel was so short that it was more like a big hand towel than a bath towel, unless it was for kid-sized individuals. The fabric had little body, and even less when it was damp.</p><p>Clutching the towel in front of her, she took a deep breath and moved toward him. He was frozen in place, wondering what she had in mind. Hoping she wanted to join him in that bed of hers, which was way too big for just one person.</p><p>She paused in front of him and said, \u201cMy bag is behind you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t. Stray water droplets clung to her breastbone, a couple cascading down her throat. He glanced lower and saw some trailing down her thighs. With a purely primal instinct, he rested his hands on her bare shoulders and licked the droplets off her throat. She sighed and acquiesced, tilting her head back and baring her throat to him.</p><p>If she\u2019d been a wolf, it would have been the equivalent of showing how much she trusted him. She appeared to revel in the feel of his tongue on her skin, her free hand grasping his shoulder as if to keep her balance. Then he worked his way down to her breastbone, capturing all the sweet drops kissing her skin, and she released a soft moan, her fingers gripping him harder, as if she was about to sink into the carpeted floor.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t finished and crouched at her legs, lapping up the sweet droplets clinging to her thighs. She chuckled, the sound throaty, sensual, aroused. \u201cTickles,\u201d she said with a hushed voice.</p><p>When he stood, he saw her nipples pressed against the thin, barely there towel and looking aroused and needy. He preferred thick and luxurious towels when he showered and dried, but on Alicia, thin and barely there was perfect.</p><p>His hand cupped a towel-covered breast as his mouth captured hers, moving her against the wall and pinning her there. As she moaned into his mouth, his desire for her ratchetted up several notches. He molded his hand to her breast, the terry cloth rough against her soft mound of flesh, the nipple pressing against the fabric. His thumb began stroking the taut nub through the terry cloth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHmm, Alicia,\u201d he whispered against her lips, drugged by the feel of her, by the whisper of her heated breath against his mouth, by the sound of her heart pounding as hard as his. She clutched at the towel until he deepened the kiss, and then her hands went around his neck and the towel slid forgotten to the floor.</p><p>Scooping her up, he carried her to the bed, yanked away the cover, and deposited her. He shucked off his clothes as she watched him, her gaze lowering to his rigid arousal. She made him hard with a touch, a glance, a whisper of a kiss. No woman had ever affected him the way she did.</p><p>When he was naked, he joined her in bed, his hand caressing her breast, his eyes looking into hers\u2014dark, rich chocolate and full of desire.</p> <p>He bent his head and kissed her parted lips while her tongue touched his, teasing and penetrating his mouth, and he sucked on her tongue, smiling when she moaned in capitulation.</p><p>His hand massaged the supple mound of her breast, enjoying her softness compared to his hardness. He leaned over and licked her nipple, mouthed it, and tugged gently on it the way she had done his. But his fingers soon swept down her soft belly and lower until he found her wet curls and the place at the apex of her thighs already swollen and moist with eagerness. She parted her legs, combing her fingers through his hair as he plied her with strokes between her legs meant to bring her to joyful climax.</p><p>Her pelvis arched against his stroking fingers as she lightly moaned with pleasure, pushing him to deepen his movements while he watched the expression on her face\u2014lost in bliss, her tongue moistening her lips, her eyes heavily lidded with lust. He loved the way she writhed under his ministrations. Loved bringing her to climax and seeing her expression of elation. Wanted to do it again and again.</p><p>Alicia hadn\u2019t meant to allow this to happen, hence the hesitation when she\u2019d stepped out of the bathroom to get her skating skirt out of her bag but found Jake standing in front of it. Dressed as she was in the skimpy towel and the way he was eyeing her with interest, she was certain he wasn\u2019t going to let her get away with just pulling a handful of clothes from her suitcase. Not that she wanted to discourage him. That was part of the problem.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have an ounce of willpower when it came to wanting him. But she imagined that if she had managed to get dressed, he\u2019d want to undress her once he saw her in the skimpy ice-skating outfit, and they\u2019d be right where they were now.</p> <p>His fingers stroking her caused a flare of white-hot heat to erupt deep inside her. With her nipples tingling with delicious feminine appeal and her freshly showered skin even more sensitive to his every touch, she arched against him like a feral animal, craving more and faster and harder and deeper. She\u2019d never felt as wild or uninhibited as she did with him. She wasn\u2019t sure why, but at the moment, she didn\u2019t care. She just wanted to enjoy the fiercely intense sensations of pleasure that he made her feel.</p><p>Her bucking against him encouraged him to stroke and push his fingers deep inside her chasm, to explore and rub and send her hurtling to the edge of the earth and beyond. She was so close to climaxing, the sweet ecstasy just within reach, and then the explosion came, the rapture of his touch pushing her over the edge into a starry universe of pleasure. Her insides quaked with completion as she cried out softly, her hands clasping his waist, then moving over his hips and his buttocks, and sweeping up his back.</p><p>With that, he spread her knees farther apart and plunged deeply into her, hard and fully, with all control cast aside. He was thick and heavy and stretched her nicely, diving so deeply that she thought he reached places no one ever had been before. He felt so good with his muscular body working her, enjoying her as she thrilled in the feel of him, his lightly haired chest brushing against her nipples and making them even more sensitive to his softly abrasive touch.</p><p>He continued to thrust, his hands raking through her hair, kneading her breasts, and cupping her face, his mouth on hers, then her jaw, her throat, her breasts. Every inch of her felt cherished beneath Jake\u2019s sexy onslaught\u2014from the way he licked her nipples, kissed them, and blew his hot breath on them, to how he smiled when she moaned and kissed her throat as his hand went back to massaging a breast.</p><p>Straddling him in the throes of passion in the woods had been an experience Alicia never would have thought she\u2019d feel. And she hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d ever feel that way again. But with Jake, every time was different, exciting, and fulfilling, and she couldn\u2019t believe anyone would find her as appealing or as sexually stimulating as he seemed to find her. That made her feel special, although she had to remind herself their relationship was so new that, in a few days, it would surely be just like the way her ex-husbands had treated her. The newness worn off. The need to fulfill her desires secondary to fulfilling his own.</p><p>She shoved aside her silly self-doubt, reminding herself that this was all it would be, some really great sex with a really great man, and then he\u2019d move on and she would, too, and that would be the end of anything between them.</p> <p>But as soon as he thrust inside her, all her thoughts were swept aside as she explored every inch that her greedy fingers could reach, from sweeping them over his firm butt and fondling him to enjoying his hard-working muscles rippling under her touch and the silky feel of his skin. Taking in a deep breath, she savored his fragrance\u2014musky male and pine breeze. She scraped her fingernails lightly over his buttocks and up his back, soliciting a low growl of ecstasy from him that made her smile.</p><p>He reached down and pulled her legs toward him so that her knees were bent, and he wrapped his arms around them, tightening them against his body as he deepened his thrusts. His pelvis rubbed against hers, her heart drumming with rapture as she arched against him, attempting to satisfy the need to soar all the way to the sun suspended in the late-morning sky.</p><p>And then she climaxed with much too loud a groan of complete blissfulness, and he kissed her mouth again before withdrawing and moving off to lie beside her. His fingers captured a handful of her hair that he brought to his lips and kissed, his eyes and lips smiling at her with a sense of smug satisfaction. She shook her head. She had known that if she got anywhere near her suitcase wearing that skimpy towel, this was exactly where she\u2019d end up.</p><p>His arm captured her and rested there, his face nuzzled against her cheek as he closed his eyes. She realized that, at least for now, they weren\u2019t going ice skating or anywhere else. She rolled onto her side like she was used to sleeping, although taking midday naps wasn\u2019t her usual thing. But having conducted surveillance on Mario late into the night and then early this morning, and having made love to Jake twice today, she felt blissfully tired.</p><p>She thought Jake had fallen asleep, but he pulled her into his arms, spooning her with his thighs and chest and with his arms around her body in a possessive way, claiming her as his own for the moment, his face nuzzled against the back of her head. His heated breath caressed her ear, and she sighed. He was sexy and hot\u2014very hot and, for the moment, all hers.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even want to think about saying good-bye. Yet all along, she knew that was where this was headed.</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want the bitch dead,\u201d Danny Massaro, Mario Constantino\u2019s cousin, muttered to him as Mario sat on his leather couch reading the morning paper, irritated as hell with the two buffoons who\u2019d botched the job. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have bothered trying to bring her in alive if you hadn\u2019t ordered us not to kill her. But she shot Carino on the trail,\u201d Danny insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve told me three times already,\u201d Mario said darkly, flicking a hard look at Danny. \u201cYou both knew she was armed. That she\u2019s nothing like her mother. You should have handled it better.\u201d</p> <p>Mario had two cousins. Two. Danny and Ferdinand Massaro. And although Danny, the younger of the two brothers, was loyal as could be, Ferdinand was the one who could be counted on to get a job done right. Too bad Mario had pissed him off. But the damned woman Ferdinand had been seeing had stolen a hell of a lot of money from Mario\u2019s Vegas casino. And no one got away with that without paying for it big time. He had a reputation to maintain, after all. He just hadn\u2019t realized how hard Ferdinand would take it. Hell, family loyalty was supposed to take priority over some damned broad.</p><p>\u201cAlicia\u2019s a bounty hunter now. If she catches sight of me, she can arrest me and turn me in for the reward,\u201d Danny said.</p><p>As if some woman could get the jump on Danny. When Mario didn\u2019t respond, Danny shoved his hands in his pockets, his action whenever he was stumped about what to do next. \u201cWhat about the guy? Can\u2019t we kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe artist?\u201d Mario snorted. \u201cLover boy?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe woman has something I want. Don\u2019t kill her. As for the guy, he\u2019ll disappear soon enough. One way or another. If he\u2019s smart, he\u2019ll leave and live another day. If he\u2019s not...\u201d Mario shrugged and looked back at the paper, reading an article about a drunk driver who had ripped out forty feet of fence on a local ranch.</p><p>Nothing noteworthy in the area. Not since killing the Greiston woman six months ago. Or the shooting at the same location today, if anyone had been aware of it.</p><p>He really should have killed Danny and Carino after they\u2019d botched the job of murdering Alicia\u2019s mother. Killing her right next to the trail, where hikers could find her, was more than stupid. And murdering her lover at the falls? Double the stupidity. Yeah, he\u2019d wanted it done, but discreetly. Idiots.</p><p>He sighed, opened the paper to the crossword puzzle, and laid the paper down on the coffee table, then pulled a pen out of his pocket. \u201cHas Carino gone home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker took him back to Denver so Doc can patch him up without the authorities getting any word of it.\u201d</p><p>Mario nodded and read: One Across: Lupus, four letters. He wrote: wolf.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Danny asked.</p><p>Mario looked up at him. \u201cYou said the artist met with her in the woods.\u201d</p><p>Danny balled his fists in his pockets. \u201cYeah, she must have planned to rendezvous with him there. I saw his truck parked near her car in the lot, but I didn\u2019t see any sign of him when I brought Carino in. Later, I found both Alicia\u2019s and her lover\u2019s vehicles parked at her hotel. They were still there when you told me to meet you here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right. Well, she\u2019s not going anywhere. Not when she thinks she\u2019s going to take me down for the murder of her mother. She\u2019ll come after me again. And she\u2019ll do it alone. You can leave a message from me to her ensuring that\u2019s the case.\u201d He grabbed a scrap of paper he\u2019d been using for his daily crossword puzzles and wrote a note: You want me, come and get me. But if lover boy is with you, consider him dead.</p><p>He folded the note in half, wrote Alicia Greiston, Room 101 on the top of it, and handed it to Danny. \u201cGo buy an envelope, stick this inside with her name and room number written on the envelope, seal it, and drop it off at the front desk\u2014but only leave it when it\u2019s busy enough that no one will notice you. Can you do that? It\u2019d be easy enough to do when a clerk is busy with a customer. Just leave it on the counter and walk away. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can do that.\u201d Danny acted annoyed that Mario had to spell it out for him as though Mario thought Danny wasn\u2019t bright enough to do the job right.</p> <p>But hell, Mario had made the mistake of trusting him before. The problem was that he needed someone damn loyal, and Danny was it.</p><p>Mario glanced back at his crossword puzzle. \u201cGo. As soon as she\u2019s following me again, grab her, and she and I will have a little talk.\u201d</p><p>He smiled darkly. This time he\u2019d learn what her mother might have passed along about his operation, and then\u2014he wasn\u2019t sure. He glanced out the window at the ski slopes and felt the waxing moon stirring his blood. The mother wouldn\u2019t succumb to his needs. Maybe the daughter would do.</p><p>But he still had another problem. Danny\u2019s brother, Ferdinand, was a loose cannon. Mario needed to get rid of him as soon as he could get hold of him. The last time Mario had attempted to have Ferdinand murdered had only made him madder... and more willing to get Mario back.</p><p>In a tangle of legs at the ice-skating rink, Alicia laughed out loud as she found herself on her butt on the ice again with Jake. His eyes were bright with laughter as he pushed her hair out of her face and grinned at her. She hadn\u2019t laughed this much in forever.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t fallen this many times in an hour on the ice since I was a little girl. And I was a lot lower to the ground then. But then again, I haven\u2019t had this much fun in years.\u201d</p><p>And she meant it. She had applauded every wobbly bit of success Jake had accomplished. And when they\u2019d fallen, she\u2019d laughed and enjoyed his good-humored responses. She wasn\u2019t the only one who was interested in Jake, though. From older teens to college-aged women, he had their undivided attention. She was certain they wished they were entangled with the hunk on the ice instead of her and laughing their heads off. She had to admit, they looked fairly risqu\u00e9 at times with his leg wedged between hers and her short flare skirt thrown back, exposing the panties of her leotard.</p><p>If Jake hadn\u2019t had such a difficult time staying on his feet and keeping from tripping Alicia up, she figured he would have been more hot and bothered in an intimate way by their close proximity. But he hadn\u2019t let on, and for that, she was grateful.</p><p>Two of the women watching him with hungry, desirous gazes had been bold enough to come to speak with him when he told Alicia he wanted her to demonstrate how she did the figure eight and other ice skating maneuvers. She hadn\u2019t wanted to leave him for a second, and now she knew for certain what a mistake that could be.</p><p>Even though she had wanted to chase off the voluptuous blond and striking brunette, she concentrated on her performance and gave Jake the show of her life as if she were trying out for the Olympics while he stood propped against the railing, smiling at her with admiration. She loved him for it because no one had ever cared how she skated except for her mother and her grandmother. But this was different, seeing the look in his eyes as she skated for him\u2014a sexual attraction, a feral desirous look in his gaze\u2014and his lips curving upward as if he was thinking sinful thoughts about some of her sexier moves.</p><p>When she was through with the last jump, she skated back to Jake. He pulled her into his arms, holding her tight, and gave her a kiss that could have melted the ice. It certainly warmed her from the tip of her cold nose to her cold toes, and he made her feel special all over again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, you know?\u201d he murmured against her ear.</p><p>His two new fans gave her simpering smiles, but their smiles were designed to get his attention. He ignored them, thankfully.</p><p>She smiled up at him. He was beautiful and fun and the best thing that had ever happened to her. \u201cYou make me feel beautiful.\u201d She leaned against him, loving the heat and hardness of his tall body but knowing they needed to skate or leave. Before they got kicked out of the rink for too much sexy cuddling. \u201cDo you want to ice skate some more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to drop by the art gallery and sign some consent forms. And it\u2019s past time for lunch. If you\u2019ve had enough fun and are ready to go. I\u2019m afraid watching you skate is getting harder and harder for me.\u201d He cast her a wickedly salacious grin.</p><p>She chuckled, wanting to check out his package, but... what the heck. She glanced down at his crotch, saw the rigid bulge in his stonewashed jeans, and was ready to ease his discomfiture anyway that she could.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She gave the women a smile that said, \u201cHe\u2019s mine, so hands off,\u201d and then skated slowly to the exit with him so that he could keep up with her. \u201cYou were gathering quite a fan club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the only male on the ice, and I looked a bit needy,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cYou looked anything but that. I think the idea of you getting tangled up with one of them was more what they had in mind.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested in getting tangled up with anyone else, believe me.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the sitting area, she helped him off with his skates first. His hands reached up to cup her face as she crouched in front of him. \u201cYou\u2019re lovely, Alicia. A free spirit, unpretentious, charming.\u201d</p><p>Her face warming, she smiled a little shyly, not used to any man complimenting her like that. She hoped he didn\u2019t feel obligated to say such things to her. She didn\u2019t expect them, and she was a little suspicious of his motives for doing so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not used to anyone complimenting you, are you?\u201d he asked, tilting her face up to look at him. His eyes challenged her to respond, but she couldn\u2019t. \u201cAre you?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>She gave a small exhalation of breath and said, \u201cNo. Once when I was in high school, some guy said he liked the way I smelled. I had spritzed on one of my mother\u2019s perfumes before I left for school that morning. Anyway, he asked me out to have pizza, and on the way over to the pizza place, he pulled into a park and said how much he wanted me. How beautiful I was. That was right before he copped a feel and was suddenly all over me, tugging at my blouse with his other hand under my skirt. I demanded he take me home before I screamed rape.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s expression hardened. \u201cThe guy was lucky I wasn\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at Jake. \u201cI\u2019m afraid a lot more would have gone on at the park if I\u2019d been with you instead. You\u2019re sort of... addictive and hard to say no to.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to the seat and switched places and removed her skates. \u201cI would have meant everything I said, if it had been me with you in the car.\u201d He looked up at her. \u201cI just hope you\u2019re not wearing a ton of bruises after all the falls that I caused.\u201d His hand caressed her calves over her tan skate tights.</p><p>His caress was gentle but oh so provocative. She shook her head. \u201cA couple, but they\u2019ll soon fade to nothing.\u201d</p><p>He helped her from her seat, then escorted her outside, his fingers interlocked with hers as if they were a boyfriend and girlfriend on a date. She liked the sensation and would have wanted more if only her mother hadn\u2019t gotten mixed up with Mario and his thugs. Alicia was destined to play the scenario with the mobsters out to the end, no matter what.</p><p>Jake unlocked the truck doors with the push of a button. \u201cI have to admit, seeing you do some of those spins, jumps, and landings, and thinking of the figure skaters who dance together made me wish I could glide across the ice with you in my arms, like ballroom dancing only, to my way of thinking, a hell of a lot sexier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, climbing into his truck. \u201cThat\u2019s because the women\u2019s tiny little skate skirts, or the form-figure skating dresses that barely cover anything, are so revealing. And then tights or tan panty hose look pretty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy.\u201d He reached over from the driver\u2019s side and stroked her thigh. \u201cGood thing no other men were there watching you perform. I would have had to fight them off.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cMy ex-husbands thought my skating was boring. After watching me the first time, neither of them would bother. They were into ice hockey\u2014guys beating up guys on the ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were crazy. I\u2019d much rather watch you dancing solo as eloquently as you do or be the one making the moves with you on the ice.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an appreciative smile as he started the engine. Where had Jake been when she could have used him years earlier in her life? Her life was way too messed up now.</p><p>She peered out the window on the drive back to her hotel from the skating rink. She kept watching for any sign of a black Mercedes, but she didn\u2019t see either one of them. With the way Jake was glancing up at his rearview mirror or out his windows, she thought he was watching for anyone following them, too.</p><p>\u201cLunch next after I sign the papers at the gallery, all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll just change while you\u2019re gone.\u201d She looked over at him to see him glancing down at her short skirt and nearly bare legs, and she had the sneaking suspicion he wanted to do something else first. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you need to work up an appetite first.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, and the sound was deep and dark and aroused. But he shook his head and ran his hand over her thigh with a gently caressing touch. She got the distinct impression it wouldn\u2019t take much for him to change his mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they arrived at her hotel, Jake escorted her to her room, his hand in hers, but he seemed to be in a real hurry. As if he was afraid he\u2019d stay and forget his business, he smiled broadly and framed her head with his hands against the outer wall beside her door instead of entering the room. \u201cIf I don\u2019t run over to the gallery now, I\u2019m likely to get awfully distracted and wait too late, and then they\u2019ll be closed.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, brows raised, hands sliding up his chest. \u201cThen you\u2019d better run over there, because I think you might just be right.\u201d</p><p>And with that, he gave her one of his searing kisses that promised much more later. Desire curled in her belly, making her feel that if she hadn\u2019t been leaning against the wall, she would have melted into a puddle at his feet.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Twenty minutes, max.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and tugged at his buttons. \u201cBy the time you drive back into town, sign the papers, and return, it\u2019ll be more like forty-five. But that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll change and lie down for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you fall asleep before I return, I\u2019ll be happy to wake you.\u201d He kissed her again and strode off before she could tug him into the room and give up on napping or anything else.</p><p>The women at the rink didn\u2019t know how really good he could be. And she liked him way too much already.</p><p>But as soon as he disappeared down the hall, she shuddered, feeling the first real inkling of fear. For as long as she could remember, she\u2019d been the survivor of one disaster or another. And her anger after her mother\u2019s killing had kept her blood hot for revenge\u2014so she hadn\u2019t really felt anything but a compelling urge to take her mother\u2019s murderers into custody. On the darker side, she hadn\u2019t cared whether she made it or not\u2014as long as they paid for their crime.</p> <p>Now, for the first time since her mother\u2019s death, she did care. Because of a man named Jake Silver. Because of the joy of living he\u2019d awakened in her. Because for once in her life, she felt worthy.</p><p>And that scared her.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Alicia entered her hotel room, and her heart skipped a beat when she saw an envelope on the blue-gray carpet where it must have been shoved underneath the door. Before she picked up the note, she considered that it might be from her informant. What if Mario and Danny were again on the move?</p><p>Her breathing suspended, she tore the envelope open and pulled out the folded note. Alicia Greiston, Room 101 was repeated on the piece of paper, but in another man\u2019s hard-bitten scrawl. She swallowed hard and opened the piece of paper and read: You want me, come and get me. But if lover boy is with you, consider him dead.</p><p>Her heart felt as though its motion had been suspended in mid-beat.</p> <p>Jake would die.</p><p>No matter how much she wanted to be with him, to live again, to enjoy life to the fullest, she\u2019d known her meeting him had been too good to be true. He\u2019d leave her anyway. She reminded herself of the way he\u2019d reacted after they\u2019d made love in the woods\u2014that this was a mistake.</p><p>It was. A grave mistake. If Jake died, it would be as though she had pulled the trigger herself. All she\u2019d been thinking of was herself, damn it.</p><p>No more. She had a job to do. And Jake had to stay out of the picture.</p><p>As fast as she could, she changed into jeans and a T-shirt, tossed the rest of her clothes and cosmetics into her bags, and hurried to the lobby. There, with her heart racing, worried Jake would discover her leaving before she could disappear and guessing he wouldn\u2019t allow it, she stood at the checkout counter, trying not to tap her fingers on the polished surface as she waited for the clerk to get off the phone.</p><p>As soon as he did and she got her bill, he said, \u201cMiss Alicia Greiston, you had a message.\u201d He passed an envelope to her, eerily like the first, with her name and room number written on top. But she thought she recognized her informant\u2019s handwriting, although she couldn\u2019t be certain because the scrawl was often disguised. With a quick thanks, she stalked toward the back door where her car was parked outside. As soon as she stowed her bags in the trunk, she drove away from Breckenridge and opened the envelope.</p><p>I want to take Mario down, too. But if you get to him first, I\u2019m all for it. He\u2019ll be in Denver at a condo in Cherry Creek North, listed under John Smith.</p><p>It was the same type of encouraging, cryptic note that she\u2019d received before, telling her that Mario and Danny were now in Breckenridge. Whoever her informant was, he had been right. She was still concerned that he might be one of Mario\u2019s men, but gut instinct told her she could trust him as far as his not working for Mario. She also assumed he was not one of the strictly good guys or he\u2019d identify himself. More than likely he was someone who had a vendetta of his own.</p> <p>Turning the car around, she drove in the direction of Denver, two hours away, and hoped Jake wouldn\u2019t hate her too much as a damnable tear slid down her cheek. She had to draw on her anger if she was going to take Mario and Danny down. Remorse and regret would get her killed before she could accomplish her mission otherwise, and she definitely would get Jake killed if she had anything more to do with him.</p><p>Impatiently, Jake signed the paperwork at the art gallery, agreed on the pricing of the photographs, and after leaving all his contact information, headed back to Alicia\u2019s inn. He was thinking he should be noble and take her to lunch first, although he already wanted to make love to her again. He\u2019d never felt that way about a woman\u2014that being separated from her for even an hour would make him crave her all the more. He was thinking of a hike on a trail, although probably not the one where he\u2019d found her earlier today, facing off against two more thugs. Maybe he could take her to a movie at the local theater later tonight. Or even better, find something on pay TV and order room service. Ice up a bottle of champagne. Anything she wanted to do was fine with him.</p><p>Before he\u2019d even reached the lot where her car was parked in the back of the inn, though, he began to have a bad feeling. He wasn\u2019t sure why he was feeling so uneasy until he realized that Alicia\u2019s red car was gone.</p><p>He parked, and with his heart beating furiously, he headed for her room. He didn\u2019t have a key card and just pounded on the door. When there was no answer, he wasn\u2019t surprised. She had to have run into town for something. Even though he knew she had to be all right and was just running an errand, he couldn\u2019t help the foreboding that said something more was wrong. If he\u2019d thought about it and not been in such a rush to get to the gallery, he would have given her his cell number. He considered using the lock picks that he carried like most lupus garous, but because of the gnawing worry that something more had happened, he went to the front desk instead. There, he broke in on a conversation the clerk was having on the phone.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, did Alicia Greiston leave a message for me, Jake Silver?\u201d he asked the scrawny suited man with slightly balding temples.</p><p>The clerk shot an annoyed look at him, shook his head, and then continued to talk to the person on the phone.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d Jake persisted, leaning against the counter, ready to climb over it and force the clerk to answer him immediately.</p><p>The clerk said to the person on the phone, \u201cExcuse me for a second.\u201d With his hand over the mouthpiece of the phone and a peeved look on his face, he turned his full attention to Jake. \u201cShe had a couple of messages, one delivered to her room and the other here at the counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho delivered them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Jake ground his teeth. \u201cShe could be in danger.\u201d</p><p>The man raised his brows as if he thought Jake was giving him a line.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a bounty hunter tracking some real criminals. They\u2019ve threatened her once already, and I had to intervene to protect her earlier in the day. I have to make sure she\u2019s not heading into danger.\u201d</p><p>The clerk looked unmoved by the comment and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cCan I see her room? Make sure it doesn\u2019t show signs that she was coerced into leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. Our policy is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave someone go with me. If there\u2019s been any sign of force, you\u2019ll have to call the police. If foul play has occurred and you don\u2019t do your part to see that she was safe in a timely manner, your job could very well be on the line.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s steely gaze narrowed even more. But he took an annoyed breath and said to the person on the phone, \u201cLet me have your number, and we\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d Then he scribbled the number down, said good-bye, and spoke to another clerk in an office. \u201cI\u2019m checking out a guest\u2019s room. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d a woman said.</p><p>Then the clerk escorted Jake to Alicia\u2019s room. \u201cI waited on her when she was checking out, and she seemed in a rush. She was looking over her shoulder, but it didn\u2019t seem that anyone was with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looked anxious, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She was in a real hurry. I was on the phone at the time, but I could see she was really apprehensive. She kept looking over her shoulder as if someone might arrive at any moment and stop her.\u201d He glanced at Jake, implying he might have been the one she was trying to avoid.</p><p>The clerk opened the door to her room and led the way. Nothing was amiss. The bed was still unmade, but her bags were gone. Jake glanced around the room, looking for anything else that might give him a clue as to why she left so abruptly. While the clerk checked out the bathroom, Jake noticed a note on the dresser, saw her name and room number on it, and opened it. Someone had warned Alicia not to stay with Jake or Jake would die, damn the perpetrator\u2019s soul who had written the note.</p><p>\u201cWas that something important?\u201d the clerk asked, pointing to the paper in Jake\u2019s hand as he rejoined him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, the perp threatened that if she took me with her, I\u2019d be dead. I told you this was serious.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we call the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s what you need to do. Tell them she\u2019s a bounty hunter trying to catch Mario Constantino and Danny Massaro, who are bail bond jumpers. And they\u2019ve made a death threat against me.\u201d He handed the clerk the slip of paper. \u201cI\u2019m going to look for her and see if I can catch sight of her car anywhere. It\u2019s a red Neon. Not sure of the license plate number, but you probably already have it when she signed in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The clerk pulled at his tie as if it was suddenly strangling him. \u201cWe would. Shouldn\u2019t you wait here until the police arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I\u2019m going to try to locate her before she comes to harm. Here\u2019s my cell phone number. The name is Jake Silver,\u201d he reminded the clerk. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>His heart beating a million miles a minute, Jake left the clerk standing in the middle of the hotel room and stalked back out of the building into the parking lot. Within seconds, Jake was driving his truck back into town. As much as he hated that Alicia had left without word to him, he figured she\u2019d been misguided into thinking she could keep him safe. He couldn\u2019t help but admire her for worrying about him, if that was the case. But the thought of her tangling with these men on her own nearly gave him heart palpitations.</p> <p>For an hour, he scoped out Breckenridge. Not finding any sign of Alicia\u2019s vehicle, he went back to the street where he was supposed to eat lunch with her. Three restaurants offered steak platters on Main Street, but none of the places was specifically called a steak restaurant, and he cursed himself for not learning the actual name. Lunchtime came and went, and after repeatedly checking all three restaurants while looking for her, Jake finally stood in the middle of the sidewalk, hoping she\u2019d still make their engagement but knowing in his gut she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>After another hour of waiting and fuming with himself for not having kept her with him when he went to the gallery, he couldn\u2019t quit worrying that she had followed the men she was tailing and was going to get herself killed if she hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>He drove all over Breckenridge, looking for her car into the night, searching through lodges, rental-condo parking lots, and B and Bs. Anywhere that she might have stayed so she could continue to trail Mario.</p><p>He remained vigilant, searching all the next morning, returning to the inn and then the restaurant where he\u2019d met her, and continuing to look for her until late that afternoon. Not finding any sign of her, he left word at the art gallery to call him if she dropped by looking to reconnect. Then hating to leave Breckenridge, dejected and miserable, fearing for her safety but not knowing what else to do, he headed for home.</p><p>He kept thinking about the trouble she might have gotten into with the men on whom she\u2019d been conducting surveillance.</p> <p>And how he could have protected her\u2014and hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Earlier that evening, Alicia had checked into a hotel in Denver and then searched for Mario\u2019s trail, finally finding it but not where her informant had said he was. The bloodred moon dominated the black night like the harbinger of death as Alicia stalked her prey\u2014Mario Constantino headed for the front steps of a redbrick townhouse. Just as she\u2019d suspected, he hadn\u2019t bothered to show up for his court date.</p><p>She\u2019d lost track of Danny Massaro, so Mario was the first one she planned to arrest. And she was ready with the arrest warrant and firepower\u2014pepper spray, a stun gun, and her pistol. She hadn\u2019t told Jake that she had earned a black belt in jujitsu, but he probably would have dismissed that training as not enough, either. And leaving the scene promptly was better than tangling with an armed assailant. But she was confident she could do this.</p><p>Every minute she\u2019d been driving to Denver from Breckenridge, she\u2019d thought about Jake Silver and felt bad about giving him, her hero, the slip. About him worrying about her. She should have left word that she had to leave, to let him know she was all right.</p><p>But having no boyfriend meant having no dead boyfriend. And no matter how much she wanted to see more of him, no matter how much she had wanted what she was sure he would have continued to offer her, she couldn\u2019t with a clear conscious allow him to get involved. Not after what had happened to her mother. These men meant business. They were ruthless.</p><p>She kept waffling about sending Jake word she was all right, but she knew that would involve lying to him, telling him she didn\u2019t want to see him further. She thought he might not believe her, considering it was a lie, and might want to protect her and stop her from doing this. But she had to finish this. It was the right thing to do\u2014not only for her mother\u2019s memory, but for those Mario and his gang might hurt in the future.</p> <p>She took a deep breath of the cool night air, trying to fortify her ragged nerves as she walked silently toward the townhouse.</p><p>On the other hand, she consoled herself with the notion that Jake was probably glad to be rid of her. Or even might have someone else in his life back home. The thought was a sour reminder that they had no future.</p><p>For now, this was her life. And as a loner, she was fine with it. She had no intention of risking anyone else\u2019s life, but she owed it to her mom to keep her promise and put Mario and Danny behind bars for good.</p><p>Leaves crunched softly underfoot as she kept her distance, certain Mario didn\u2019t hear her following him as far away as she was, hidden in the shadows and guided by the mellow brass street lamps lighting the way. But she should have known it was too easy tracking down the bastard, who had a rap sheet as long as she was tall. Why the judge had set bail for him, she still couldn\u2019t fathom. Unless he had bribed the judge.</p><p>Maybe this was a wake-up call. She was used to getting her man, or woman, with the least amount of collateral damage\u2014mainly because they usually weren\u2019t all that intelligent and often were way too predictable. The job often depended on wit over brawn to subdue a perp. A little psychology could go a long way.</p><p>But this time it felt wrong. This was just too easy\u2014as if she had been led into a trap.</p><p>The hair at the nape of her neck and on her arms stood on end as she watched Mario knock on the door of a brick townhouse. It silently opened to him. She couldn\u2019t see anyone inside, as if it was one of those nightmarish haunted houses with automatically opening ghostly doors that drew the unwilling victim inside. He entered, then the door shut with a clunk.</p><p>Damn, he was supposed to have been alone.</p> <p>The lamplight nearest her sputtered ominously and then flickered out, plunging her into darkness. Immediately, the setting seemed perfect for a blood-seeking vampire moving silently through the night beneath the hunter\u2019s moon. Again, her thoughts shifted to her mother and how she\u2019d introduced Alicia to her love of vampires when Alicia had been a teen and they\u2019d watched handsome and sexy Count Dracula sweep the heroine off her feet in a college stage play. Alicia had wished she was the heroine the count intended to seduce.</p><p>Snapping herself out of her memories, she saw something move in her peripheral vision. A shadow glided quickly toward her from a drive-through alley between that townhouse and the next. A vampire, her brain registered; only of course it wasn\u2019t. He was a man and a genuine threat.</p><p>Pepper spray already in hand, she whirled to spray him in the face, but footfalls raced directly behind her before she realized two of them were coming at her from different locations. Before she could whip around and protect herself, a sharp pain to the back of her head registered.</p><p>She felt herself falling, the can of spray slipping from nerveless fingers, heard the can clunk as it struck the stone walk, felt her body hit the unforgiving walk, and saw the red, red moon watching her as if saying it had warned her about the night. And she should have taken heed. The last thought she had was maybe it was time to bury her pain and find a new occupation.</p><p>Then the red moon faded to black.</p><p>\u201cAlicia Greiston,\u201d a husky male voice said, penetrating the darkness, but the pain in her head splintered every thought she tried to conjure up.</p><p>A hand roughly shook her shoulder. She wanted to open her eyes and see where she was, instantly remembering her mission\u2014take Mario Constantino into custody\u2014and her failure to do so. She\u2019d been attacked from behind.</p><p>Was this man one of his henchmen? This really wasn\u2019t good.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re awake.\u201d His voice hinted at dark amusement. The smell of cigarette smoke wafted in the air, and a sickly sweet cologne penetrated her airspace.</p><p>Then he drew closer, and she realized she was lying on a soft mattress, and he was pressing his body against her side as he leaned over her. His fingers worked clumsily on the buttons on her jacket. Oh God, what did he plan to do to her? Rape her? Torture her? Kill her? Maybe all three. But her head hurt so badly she couldn\u2019t gather the wits to respond in any way.</p><p>He jerked the sleeves down her arms, then removed her gun holster, the gun still in it. Her head was pounding so hard that she only had a tenuous grip on remaining conscious. Her mind was slipping away into grayness until his fingers began working on her blouse buttons, which instantly gave her more clarity.</p><p>Intent on fighting him despite the way her head was splintering with pain, she opened her eyes and saw only blackness. How could he tell what he was doing in the dark? She couldn\u2019t even see his face.</p><p>She grabbed his wrists\u2014big, rawboned, powerful. He laughed, the sound husky and eerie.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were awake.\u201d He easily shook free of her hold, seized her wrists, and held them above her head. \u201cWe can do this easily or we can do this the hard way. Either suits me.\u201d</p><p>All the moisture in her mouth evaporated. She had to fight him, but not yet. When she could, she would knee him in the groin, find her gun, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cI admire you, Alicia. Not just anyone could have tracked Mario down like you did with the scant clues I was able to give you. He would have killed you if you\u2019d approached him, though. You have me to thank for saving your life.\u201d The man\u2019s tone was disquieting, as if she owed him and he meant for her to pay big time.</p><p>\u201cWho are you? What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that. To the point. No pussyfooting around. I\u2019m Ferdinand Massaro, your knight in shining armor. The one who\u2019s been giving you clues as to where Mario is staying. They were only roundabout clues since I never could get a real handle on where he was at any one time, but you did it. Used your investigative skills to find him. Now I\u2019ll show you what I want. Just be patient. But don\u2019t fight me on this. I\u2019d just as soon knock you out and take you that way. Your decision. A word of warning, though. If my brother, Danny, gets hold of you\u2014or me, we\u2019re both dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Trying to get her rapid heartbeat under control, she attempted to stall him, realizing that the man who had pulled the trigger and killed her mother was this man\u2019s brother. \u201cAre you a friend of Mario\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend?\u201d Ferdinand laughed bitterly. \u201cNo. His friends don\u2019t live long. We\u2019re cousins, if you didn\u2019t know. He sent one of his men to kill me. Only I got the upper hand and killed Mario\u2019s henchman first. But the assassin gave me a present before I ended his miserable life.\u201d Ferdinand let go of her hands and went to work on her belt, but she couldn\u2019t let him rape her or whatever he planned on doing.</p><p>With a superhuman effort, she tried to sit up, intending to hit him or kick him or something, but the pain streaked across her skull with a vengeance, and she collapsed back against the bed in a near faint.</p> <p>\u201cHell, I figured you wouldn\u2019t go easy. Just know this. You\u2019re mine. The bastard who turned me is dead, but I\u2019m not about to live alone like this. And since Mario killed Candy, you\u2019re it, dollface. Mine.\u201d He slammed his iron fist into the side of her head, creating an eruption of pain so profound that she cried out, and the darkness swiftly closed in on her again.</p><p>The sound of gruff angry male voices brought Alicia to semiconsciousness as she lay naked on a soft mattress, presumably in Ferdinand\u2019s bedroom. Her head pounded, her arm throbbed and stung, and she couldn\u2019t figure out why it hurt when only her head should have. The room was black as night, but a thin strip of light appeared beneath a closed door.</p><p>\u201cYou been following Mario,\u201d a brusque man said in another room. \u201cAnd Jimmy\u2019s been following him, too. Only Jimmy\u2019s paid for his... mistake. He said it was your idea to trail Mario. So what the hell for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Ferdinand said, his voice just as dark. \u201cMy cousin\u2019s damned paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Mario\u2019s already pissed off at you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause his thug didn\u2019t kill me last time.\u201d Ferdinand sounded defiant, as though he still had the upper hand. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have murdered Candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCandy shouldn\u2019t have stolen from Mario\u2019s casino. Not only that, but Mario said you got in his way with Missy Greiston.\u201d</p><p>Her mother? Alicia swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cShe was dating a loser. How did I know Mario wanted a piece of the action?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted her because Tony was working for Mario and knew his business. You wanted to muscle in on Mario\u2019s territory. And you figured you\u2019d get the goods on Mario through Missy. The straw that broke the camel\u2019s back? Candy\u2019s gambling scheme that made Mario lose some big bucks. He doesn\u2019t like to lose. Not to a woman. And not when you\u2019d been porking her on top of it. He figured you had something to do with Candy\u2019s going after his money. Admit it.\u201d</p><p>Something hit something with a dull thud and a crunching noise, and a loud grunt of pain sounded. Cursing followed, mixed with moans, and then the words spoken were suddenly silenced. No one said anything further for what seemed like an eternity. The sound of Alicia\u2019s blood pounding in her ears was the only thing she heard as she strained to hear what else was happening in the other room.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know anything,\u201d another man said, his voice quieter, much more sinister.</p><p>The silence that followed was more frightening than the harsh words. Because with the silence, she couldn\u2019t tell whether the men were still a long way off or coming for her.</p><p>\u201cWas Ferdinand alone?\u201d the sinister-sounding man finally asked, his words spoken in the direction of the bedroom as if he was suddenly looking that way, suddenly aware Ferdinand might not have been alone.</p><p>\u201cWhen I grabbed him in the living room getting a whiskey at the bar, he was the only one who made a sound. If anyone else was in the place, she would have checked to see what was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, he was naked. I thought you would have already checked to see if he had a woman stashed back there before I arrived. Jimmy said Ferdinand had grabbed a woman and taken her away with him. Maybe\u2019s he\u2019s got her tied up and gagged in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>The nightmare was only going to get worse. Alicia knew they\u2019d look for anyone else in the place, and she figured she didn\u2019t stand a chance if they found her.</p><p>She swung her legs over the bed, felt dizzy and sick at the same time, and forced her vision to clear. Then she swept her hands over the mattress, snagging articles of clothing: bra, panties, slacks, stockings, shirt, jacket. Everything but her shoes. She meant to stand, but as soon as her bare feet hit the carpeted floor, she crumpled. She couldn\u2019t walk. Couldn\u2019t do much but slide under the bed. With pain shrieking through her head and her arm throbbing as if it had been cut badly, she managed to slip underneath the bed, knocking her shoes under there with her.</p><p>Dust floated upward underneath the bed, and she stifled a sneeze, holding her nose and gritting her teeth.</p> <p>The door opened; a light flipped on. Footfalls walked around the room, black leather dress shoes squeaking. Heels toward her, the shoes paused at the edge of the bed. She froze. She smelled a man\u2019s pungent cologne and the thick odor of smoke. The leather shoes walked away, and the footfalls headed back down the hallway. \u201cNo one else here. Kill the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Ferdinand didn\u2019t object. Why didn\u2019t he say anything? Had they knocked him out? Taped his mouth shut?</p><p>She shivered with fear. If they found her, they\u2019d kill her, too.</p><p>No one said anything further. She heard no other sounds until a door in another room opened and closed.</p><p>Then eerie silence prevailed. Too frightened to leave her safe spot underneath the bed, she lay there waiting, her head and arm hurting so much that she didn\u2019t think anything could get any worse.</p><p>She was wrong.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Alicia must have slept for some time, she thought, as she found herself pinned under the framework of a bed, but she felt strange, lying on her side and unable to move to her back. Her arms weren\u2019t right. Her legs either. She shifted her head, and it didn\u2019t seem right any more than the rest of her did.</p><p>As if... as if she was living in an alien body. She struggled to turn onto her back, but her strange legs wouldn\u2019t allow it. She was experiencing another nighttime paralysis. Had to be. The way she struggled to move and couldn\u2019t, her heart racing, her mouth opening to cry out in frustration. But then she recalled Ferdinand and the men with him and worried they might be in the other room, so she grew very still.</p><p>After a few minutes, she couldn\u2019t stand the suspense any longer and again tried to roll onto her back, but she couldn\u2019t in the confined space beneath the bed. And she couldn\u2019t use her arms to crawl out from under the bed either. What was wrong with her?</p><p>Somehow, squirming and clawing at the carpeted floor, she finally managed to extract herself from under the bed and stared at herself in a floor-length mirror in disbelief.</p><p>She was a wolf.</p><p>Pointed ears, beige fur under her chin, darker markings around her ears and framing her face, light gray legs, and attractive darker markings on her torso, with a big bushy tail swishing from side to side\u2014a beautiful wolf, but not real. This couldn\u2019t be real.</p><p>It had to be sleep paralysis. Except that the only time she\u2019d experienced it, she hadn\u2019t been able to move at all or to yell. She had just whimpered, unable to free herself from sleep. Yet she\u2019d been aware she was trying to escape the sleep paralysis. And when she awoke, she remembered the terror of being paralyzed and unable to break free.</p><p>But in this case, everything she smelled and touched with her wet nose, felt under her paw pads, and tasted with her tongue was too real to be a dream.</p><p>She meant to laugh at herself for thinking she was a wolf, but a woof erupted from deep within her throat. For a moment, she was too stunned to react.</p><p>She struggled to remember what Ferdinand had said to her.</p><p>But the assassin gave me a present before I ended his miserable life.</p><p>Ferdinand had gotten the best of him and killed him. But the man had given him a present first. A present? A virus? That made Ferdinand capable of biting someone else and infecting that person with the virus? That person being Alicia? Who now was a wolf?</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to think of what else Ferdinand had said that might give her a clue.</p><p>The bastard who turned me is dead, but I\u2019m not about to live alone.</p><p>The assassin had turned Ferdinand. Turned him. As in... had bitten him and...</p><p>She glanced down at her foreleg, which was matted with blood. Had Ferdinand bitten her arm? As a wolf? It had hurt like the devil before when she was lying naked on the bed. Naked. He\u2019d stripped her of her clothes and then bitten her to... to turn her?</p><p>She paced across the floor, panting, so confused, so upset that her thoughts were scattered a million miles wide. She had to be dreaming, no, experiencing a night terror.</p><p>She swallowed hard and focused her attention on the doorway to the bedroom.</p><p>When Ferdinand had undressed her, the room had been pitch-black. She couldn\u2019t see him, couldn\u2019t understand how he could see her. If he... if he was...</p><p>She shook her head and began to pace again. The room was dark, the curtains drawn, the lights all off. Yet she could now see in the dark.</p><p>And wolves had nocturnal vision for hunting. Which meant? Ferdinand had...</p><p>She wanted to laugh out loud, but the sound came out like a garbled woof. Ferdinand had been a werewolf. That was too weird to believe.</p><p>She paused and glanced back at the doorway. What had become of him?</p><p>Her heart was in her throat, and fear cloaked her with the worry that she still could be discovered. But the need to learn what had happened to Ferdinand overwhelmed her need for self-preservation. She loped out of the bedroom and down the hall, smelling the shampooed carpet, the cologne worn by three different men, whiskey, and lemon wax cleaner. Her ears twisted back and forth, listening to the sounds outside\u2014cars driving by, a siren way off in the distance, the hum of an air-conditioning unit, but otherwise an eerie silence prevailed.</p><p>As much as she wanted to see what had happened to Ferdinand, dread bunched in the pit of her stomach. The hall opened into a living room, spacious with high ceilings, richly carved dark wood furniture, and two couches and four chairs\u2014all covered in brown brushed leather. She stopped dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sitting on one of the couches, head lolled back against the top of the cushion, Ferdinand Massaro, her former informant, was staring lifelessly at the ceiling with cold black eyes. She barely breathed, felt her furry legs wobble beneath her, and sat before she collapsed.</p><p>Silver duct tape covering his mouth, and with his head tilted at an odd angle, Ferdinand looked as though his neck had been broken. She blinked away tears. The room was dark, no lights on in the recessed fixtures, yet she could see the man\u2019s hefty size, over six feet tall and meaty, with matted black hair covering his chest, and hairy legs. He was naked. Had he raped her before he was murdered?</p><p>She didn\u2019t think so. Her front leg still pained her where she\u2019d been bitten, and she wondered if he\u2019d... The notion was too unreal to believe, but what if he\u2019d shape-shifted into a wolf, then bit her and, after that, shifted back into a human form? Then the men had come for him before he could do anything more to her.</p> <p>Her mouth still agape, she felt chilled all over despite her warm wolf\u2019s fur coat, her brain fuzzy from the knowledge she might have been infected with some weird virus, and the man who undoubtedly had done it to Ferdinand had been murdered. Then Ferdinand himself had met his fate.</p><p>I\u2019m not about to live alone like this, Ferdinand had said. Like this, like some cursed being? She had to wake up from this nightmare. She wasn\u2019t a wolf. She couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>Trying to get her rapid breathing under control and attempting to banish the light-headedness she was experiencing so she could think more clearly, she finally realized she had to get out of here\u2014now. The realization didn\u2019t mesh well with the notion she was fighting that she was a wolf, consciously sitting in Ferdinand\u2019s living room and staring at his dead body. Smelling his dead body.</p><p>What if someone called the cops or one of Ferdinand\u2019s murderers returned to tidy up the place?</p><p>She had to get out of there.</p> <p>Hours passed before Alicia finally managed to shift back to her human self and dress. She left Ferdinand\u2019s townhouse and walked forever until she could call a taxi far from the townhouse where he had lived. Then after picking up her car near the townhouse where Mario had been meeting someone and where Ferdinand had grabbed her, she returned to her hotel on the outskirts of Denver. She intended to get some sleep and leave before dawn and get as far away from there as she possibly could. She couldn\u2019t quit thinking of what she had become, of what that meant for her if she had the horrible urge to shape-shift again\u2014especially if she wasn\u2019t hidden from the eyes of the world if it happened once more.</p><p>Scared, exhausted, and unsure of what to do, she stripped off her clothes, showered, and pulled on a slinky black nightgown covered in pink and yellow flowers. She collapsed in the hotel-room bed, intending to push all the worries out of her brain until she could think more clearly in the morning. And make some sound decisions about what she would do next.</p><p>Lying in the hotel bed, Alicia finally closed her eyes, unsure whether she would wake again in the form of a wolf or as herself. She gave a soft snort of disbelief and halfway wondered if Ferdinand\u2019s blows to her head twice in one night were making her loopy. Or if he might have drugged her with something that was making her imagine stuff. Something like LSD. That in the morning everything would again be clear and she would realize it had all been a really bizarre nightmare. A total figment of her imagination. Except that it had seemed so real.</p><p>One thing was certain: Ferdinand was dead.</p><p>With all those thoughts running through her tired mind, she finally succumbed to sleep and dreamed like she\u2019d never dreamt before.</p><p>With the hotel curtains shut tight, the bed covered in an orange floral spread, and prints on the walls of floral bouquets, Alicia dressed in a satiny black nightgown touching her ankles, with a slit up the side and spaghetti straps that bared her shoulders as she headed from the bathroom to the bed. But her attention was drawn to the sitting room as a flicker of movement caught her eye.</p> <p>She turned. To her astonishment, Jake Silver stalked toward her, naked, his lean muscled body gorgeous in the low light of the room, his eyes and lips smiling in a lustful, greedy way. She knew as soon as she saw him that he desired her as much as she craved being with him. But somewhere in the back of her mind she knew this was a big mistake. Yet she couldn\u2019t remember why. Why was seeing him not a safe thing to do?</p><p>And she vaguely wondered why he was here. How he had found her. And why he had no clothes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care and stretched her arms up to take hold of him. To embrace him. To make love to him. She wanted him with a passion that she couldn\u2019t quell.</p><p>His kiss on her mouth started a low, slow burn growing in the small of her belly, the heat spreading outward as his hands cupped her face, holding her just the way he wanted her. The pressure on her lips increased until she openly invited him in. And he leaped at the invitation, plunging his tongue into her mouth, his hands shifting to her shoulders, gripping her as if he\u2019d lost her forever and had once again found her. He pulled her into his hard embrace, holding her tight as his mouth kissed the top of her head, his arms encircled her back as if they were two lovers reunited.</p><p>The familiarity felt phenomenal. As if they belonged together. As if they were bound to each other in some mysterious way.</p><p>Yet something was terribly amiss. She felt it in her bones. Something was wrong with her. She couldn\u2019t... be with Jake. Because... because...</p><p>No matter how hard she tried to think, she couldn\u2019t come up with the reason. His hands brushed down her naked back, his mouth sweeping across her jaw, lower, his tongue on her throat, and then his lips took in a nipple, licking and sucking, and she squeezed his broad back and moaned.</p><p>Hot, hot, she was burning up with heat. Delicious, sexy heat. And the realization dawned that he wasn\u2019t upset with her for leaving him without a word.</p> <p>All that seemed to matter to him was that they were together again. She cherished him for it, wanted to meld with him, be one with him, and never let go.</p><p>Forever, he touched her and kissed her, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of stroking her. Then he looked into her eyes, his gaze filled with the smoky haze of lust and something more\u2014a yearning to be with her almost as if this wasn\u2019t enough. And then he swept her up into his arms and carried her to the bed and collapsed in it with her in a purely fun-hearted way.</p><p>The kisses began anew as he fondled her breasts, his mouth on hers, on her cheeks, on her eyes. She kissed him back rabidly, her fingers stroking his shoulders, his back, his waist, hips, and buttocks, wanting to feel every hard inch of him.</p><p>And then his fingers began stroking her, capturing her in a web of exultation, the feeling uplifting, tantalizing, wanting, until the world split in two.</p><p>Jake couldn\u2019t wait a second longer when he felt Alicia shudder with climax, and he plunged deep between her spread thighs\u2014into the woman of his dreams. He thought he\u2019d lost her for good. The worry that had plagued him for days was thrust aside as he wrapped himself in her heat and loved her like no other woman he\u2019d ever been with. He wanted her, body and soul. He swore this was only the beginning.</p><p>Jake jerked awake, stared at the empty mattress next to him and wondered what the hell had happened. She was real. Alicia Greiston had been with him, loving him as he\u2019d loved her back.</p><p>He raked his hands through his tussled hair, staring into the dark. He had barely thought of anything but Alicia since he\u2019d lost her\u2014wondering if she\u2019d planned her disappearance or if the men she\u2019d been after had planned it for her. And he couldn\u2019t quit berating himself for not having stayed with her.</p><p>But the dream had been so real, like she had truly been with him. He wasn\u2019t a dreamer. Had never recalled anything that he dreamed. The experience left him longing for her touch, to know she was safe, and when she was gone, he felt bereft. He couldn\u2019t quit thinking of her, sharing a kiss, a smile, heart pounding, bare bodies pressed together, breath intermingled, hands clutching each other, tongues touching, her lips parting for him, offering herself to him fully.</p><p>In that brief nocturnal moment, she was his. He prayed she was alive and well, that his dream of her was a manifestation of the real Alicia Greiston, and he wondered if it represented a need to make everything real between them again. He vowed to find her and keep her safe, no matter how long that took.</p><p>Tomorrow, he was searching for her again.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>For seven weeks, Jake had visited Alicia in her dreams while she was kept on the run, sure Mario\u2019s men were searching for her. But her dreams were so real, as if Jake was coming to her in the middle of the night and overwhelming her with deeply pleasurable emotions as she ravished him back.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t put it off any longer. Having remained human for a whole week without one inkling of an urge to shape-shift, the second time she\u2019d had such a shift-free week, Alicia had made up her mind. She\u2019d finally tracked down Mario Constantino and Danny Massaro once more, and foregoing her bounty hunter\u2019s fee, she had called the police and told them where to find the bail-skippers. Tackling them alone would be too dangerous. And with the shape-shifting problems she was having, her situation was even more precarious.</p><p>With her life turned upside down by this strange being that she\u2019d become, nothing mattered but trying to get her untenable condition under control. Although she thought maybe the condition had gone away since she hadn\u2019t had another episode of changing into the wolf for a whole glorious week, twice now. She hoped that maybe it truly was some weird virus that had finally run its course. Still, the worry lurked in her bones that at any moment she might once again become a wolf through no choice of her own.</p><p>But she had to take care of one more thing before she disappeared for good.</p><p>She drove to Breckenridge, intending to go to the art gallery to see if anyone could give her information on where Jake lived or just send word to him to let him know she was all right. She couldn\u2019t see him any further. Not now that she was whatever she was. She had to vanish from Colorado altogether. Yet the dreams wouldn\u2019t allow her to let him go.</p><p>Nursing a cold cup of brewed tea that had been hot at first, she sat in the restaurant across the street from the art gallery, waiting until a tourist busload of visitors filed out of the gallery, her thoughts centered on Jake\u2019s first kiss at this very table after he had rescued her from one of Mario\u2019s men. Gentle and unassuming, his kiss had sparked a desire for him that she couldn\u2019t have quashed even if she\u2019d wanted to. She thought back on ice skating with him, making love with him in the woods. She\u2019d never been so adventurous or uninhibited with a man. Nor enjoyed being with one as much as she had with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her nighttime dreams of Jake had made her believe she was being punished for running away without a word and not telling him she was all right. She was safe, at least as safe as she could be, with this wolf business that plagued her now... and Mario\u2019s men tailing her from time to time. At least that\u2019s who she thought had been following her. Although having found \u201cbugs\u201d on her car four times in the early days while she tried to track down Mario, she thought maybe someone else was on her trail.</p><p>But Mario had said Jake would be dead if he continued to tag along with her, and she knew that hadn\u2019t been idle bullying. Mario\u2019s kind didn\u2019t make pointless threats. Hopefully, he was behind bars again. She\u2019d had the notion that she might get in touch with Jake after Mario and Danny were again incarcerated, but that didn\u2019t matter now. Not with what she\u2019d become.</p><p>She clutched her teacup tighter, then released it and sighed. With nerves steeled, she paid for her tea, left the restaurant, and headed across the street to the gallery before the shop closed for the evening. Chimes rang when she opened the door and stepped inside.</p> <p>A woman in a flouncy floral skirt and pink shell was talking to a man wearing a ponytail and dressed in black as if he was a goth. The man\u2019s chin rested on his fist while he nodded and stared at a blob of orange splashed against a sea of purple. Alicia raised her brows. If only she could get thousands of dollars for \u201cartwork\u201d like that while staying hidden at home. She hadn\u2019t attempted any more bounty hunting, what with the unpredictability of her new condition. She wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to earn a living in the future.</p><p>Another woman dressed in a business suit was speaking to a small group of what looked to be college students and a slightly older woman who might have been their art teacher.</p><p>A suited man was busy talking to a woman who seemed more intrigued by him than the painting they were standing in front of.</p><p>Alicia frowned. She needed to question the staff pronto and return to her hotel room, then leave the area forever. That made her sad as she thought about how she wouldn\u2019t be able to visit her mother where she\u2019d died any longer, although she\u2019d made one last trip there before she\u2019d stopped at the restaurant.</p><p>The art gallery staff continued to court those they had been speaking to when she\u2019d arrived. Not being able to question them about Jake, she searched for the paintings he had done. A group of paintings of naked women caught her eye, and she smiled a little, thinking of her conversation with him about painting his old girlfriends in the nude and the sexy smile he\u2019d given in return. But the name signed at the bottom wasn\u2019t Jake Silver.</p> <p>She checked on landscapes next, mostly featuring the Rockies, but none of them had his signature either. Lots more blob pictures were featured all over the place, not his unless he was too embarrassed to sign what he painted and used a different name to disguise his own.</p><p>But then she came across a display of photographs. And became engrossed in them. Wildflowers of Colorado. Wild, exotic, in colors so vivid that they looked unreal. The details so defined that she felt she could reach out and touch them and feel the soft velvety petals. Deep orange paintbrush and red fairy-trumpet flowers, cinnabar-red alpine wallflowers and rosy pussytoes, fuchsia fairy slipper orchids, bright pink primrose, and spotted wood lilies in a tangerine color.</p><p>Her mother had taught Alicia the beauty of wildflowers in their natural habitats when she was younger. Her mother had loved to hike and observe the great blue sky, wisps of clouds, majestic mountains, and towering trees. Even though her mother had been an extrovert and fed off the hustle and bustle of being around tons of people as she waitressed in a busy cafeteria, she still liked to soak in the beauty of nature, and Alicia had shared her mother\u2019s love of the wilderness.</p><p>Alicia tried to rein in her sadness when she thought of her mother dying alone in that wilderness with no one to protect her. She took a deep shuddering breath, reminding herself why she\u2019d become a bounty hunter, which had ultimately led her to the unfortunate condition she was in now. Who would have ever thought?</p><p>But for the moment, seeing the photographs brought back the happier memories of Alicia and her mother on nature walks, and tears formed in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d the woman in the flowery skirt asked. Ponytail man had left, apparently without buying the orange blob as it was still hanging on the wall.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I wonder if you could tell me about Jake Silver. He was leaving something off at the art gallery a few weeks back. I need to get in touch with him. It\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ.S.\u201d The woman smiled brightly. \u201cOh yes, he\u2019s...\u201d She sighed and didn\u2019t have to say what was on her mind. The guy was a virile, hunky stud. The woman motioned to the photos. \u201cThe photographs you\u2019re admiring are his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ.S.?\u201d Alicia looked down at the extremely small print. Modest, or embarrassed to proclaim they were his? They were beautiful.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s his autograph. We just started carrying his work. I hope we sell a lot and he makes more trips up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s not from around here. I don\u2019t recall where he\u2019s from exactly, but it\u2019s not Breckenridge. He did come in a few times in the past several weeks, looking for a dark-haired woman, who\u2014\u201d The woman\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWho looked like you, from his description. Are you Alicia Greiston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am.\u201d Hope stirred anew that Jake had left contact information for her, yet the knowledge he was looking for her saddened her, too. He had to have been angry with her for running out on him the way she had. She wanted so badly to see him, but...</p><p>She swallowed hard. How could she see him, knowing what she\u2019d now become?</p> <p>The woman\u2019s mouth pursed a little. \u201cOh. Well, he left something for you.\u201d The woman didn\u2019t look pleased and stalked off to a desk near the entrance.</p><p>So it wasn\u2019t Alicia\u2019s imagination that the woman was interested in Jake. Feeling bone-deep sadness that she couldn\u2019t see Jake further and that she had to cut any ties with him, Alicia watched as the woman pulled an envelope out of a desk drawer, then returned. But a streak of jealousy raced through Alicia\u2019s veins, too, as she considered how the woman would most likely ply her feminine wiles on Jake every time he chanced to visit the gallery when Alicia wished she could be with him instead.</p><p>Alicia\u2019s hand trembled as she took the envelope, dying to see what he had said to her. Afraid also.</p><p>She tucked it into her purse and said, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at the photographs. Although she knew she shouldn\u2019t buy one, that taking one with her would remind her of the time they had spent together and what she had lost, she reasoned that her mother would have loved having one of them. With that thought firmly in mind, Alicia decided on the tangerine spotted wood lilies. Although she wanted the fuchsia fairy slipper orchids, the picture was too big and cost too much. \u201cI\u2019ll take that one.\u201d</p><p>Alicia handed her a credit card, and the woman feigned a polite smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just wrap this up for you.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the woman had taken the photo down and walked off, Alicia pulled the envelope out of her purse and ripped it open. In bold strokes, Jake had written: Call me! And left his phone number where she could reach him.</p><p>Her stomach tightened. She sensed from his note that he was angry and frustrated with her for having taken off without a word. And she didn\u2019t blame him. He seemed the kind of man who wouldn\u2019t have given in to threats by Constantino or his men. If Jake had known why she had left him, he would have been furious, wanting to deal with them in his own way. But he didn\u2019t know what the men were capable of. And his wonderfully macho nature wouldn\u2019t have kept him from being murdered. On the contrary, his protectiveness for her would have gotten him killed faster.</p><p>She pulled out her phone and opened it. The battery was dead. She\u2019d have to call Jake when she got to her hotel room.</p><p>Then she noticed the suited man moving his hands down the arms of the woman he\u2019d been talking to in a solicitous manner while she adoringly looked up at him. He glanced back at the other two employees, saw they were occupied, and then with a smile, he motioned to a little room, led the woman inside, and shut the door.</p><p>At the same instant, Alicia felt sudden heat penetrate every inch of her body. The heat. Oh God, no.</p><p>The urge to shift hit her fast and furious. Heat shimmered through every cell, through every tissue. She glanced around the gallery, looking for a way out of this nightmare.</p><p>The woman with Alicia\u2019s photo had disappeared into a back room. She had Alicia\u2019s credit card, and Alicia had to have it to survive. The other saleswoman was walking outside with the art students and their teacher, blocking the doorway.</p><p>Looking for the restroom, Alicia spied a sign directing her down a hall and rushed to make her way there before she had an \u201caccident.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she entered the ladies\u2019 restroom and found no one in there, she hurried into the handicapped stall. Normally, she avoided using the handicapped stall if another stall was available, leaving it to women who truly needed it, but tonight she was as handicapped as anyone.</p><p>Slipping out of the short-sleeved dress she wore, she hung it on the hook on the door, then kicked off her pumps. Barely free of her bra and panties, she shifted, the heat fusing every inch of her body until her bones felt as if they were liquefying and remolding, but in a flash. The next thing she knew, she was dropping down on all four feet\u2014furry, long legged, with long a bushy tail\u2014a small gray wolf.</p><p>Once again she cursed Ferdinand Massaro for having bitten her and leaving her to face this dilemma on her own. Although she wouldn\u2019t have wanted to see what he\u2019d had in mind to do with her if he\u2019d lived. And she would have been in a lot more danger if she\u2019d remained with him because of his connections.</p><p>As if she wasn\u2019t in danger now.</p><p>Pacing, she stalked back and forth in the stall\u2014still too small for a highly agitated wolf. It was nearly closing time. She wasn\u2019t sure how long she\u2019d been in the restroom, trying to will herself back into her human form, when someone knocked on the restroom door and opened it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She froze in place inside the stall. Could they see her wolf legs beneath the door of the stall? She backed up against the tile wall. Her heart was pumping even more rapidly, if that were possible, as she barely breathed.</p><p>\u201cClosing in two minutes,\u201d a woman said, sounding impatient. It was the woman who\u2019d been talking to the students.</p><p>Instinctively, Alicia knew she couldn\u2019t be caught in a wolf\u2019s form. She\u2019d discarded her bra, panties, and heels on the restroom floor. With the shift hitting her so quickly, she couldn\u2019t do anything else but drop them. What would people think? That she\u2019d eaten Little Red Riding Hood? Or that she was Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf all wrapped up in one?</p> <p>Oh God, what was she going to do? Since being turned, she\u2019d never been in this bad a fix. As her grandfather used to say, this would learn her. She could never, ever be out in public again during the phase of any moon\u2014waxing, waning, or full. So much for not having to shift all last week. She was making up for it now. It seemed she\u2019d never get rid of this condition or learn to control it.</p><p>At least she hadn\u2019t wanted to rip out people\u2019s throats, like the old werewolf tales portrayed. And she had her human conscience, so she wasn\u2019t totally a feral animal. And she was a beautiful wolf, not some hideous beastly creature. Not that any of it mattered while she was stuck in a restroom stall as a wolf with women\u2019s garments strewn about her paws.</p><p>Concentrate! She tried again to will herself to shift.</p><p>Another minute went by, and knocking sounded on the door. Yes, all right. She knew. It was nearly closing time. She\u2019d worked on the clock before. She knew how employees wanted to go home when it was time to go, and how rude customers were to expect employees to stay all hours at their convenience.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d a woman said, then heels clicked across the floor toward the stall.</p> <p>Wolves couldn\u2019t sweat, or Alicia would have been perspiring up a storm. They panted when they were overheated, but she didn\u2019t want to even do that, afraid the woman would hear her. Instead, she stood frozen like a furry wolf statue in the corner of the stall, as far away from the door as she could get, her mouth shut tight, her ears focused on the woman\u2019s approaching footfalls. The slight tremor in the floor reverberated through Alicia\u2019s paws as she kept her eyes riveted on the door.</p><p>Two choices. She instinctually knew she had only two choices. Bite the woman and turn her into what Alicia was. Heaven forbid. She wouldn\u2019t want to wish this condition on anyone ever! But then the woman would scream bloody murder. The other two employees would come running or call the cops, or both. Then she\u2019d have to bite all of them, too. Or kill the woman. Which would be the same scenario. In the end, they\u2019d put her down like a vicious wild animal.</p><p>A rough knocking on the stall door nearly gave Alicia a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>No, no she wasn\u2019t all right. Please... don\u2019t... come... in!</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d</p> <p>When Alicia still didn\u2019t respond, the woman hurried out of the restroom.</p><p>She was going for the authorities. Probably worried a dead body was in the stall. Would be, too, if they caught Alicia like this\u2014and killed her.</p><p>She paced some more. Shift, damn it! Change! Turn! What were the magic words?</p><p>\u201cA woman\u2019s in the stall. She was the one who bought Mr. Silver\u2019s photograph. She looked to be late twenties or so, not all that old, but I think she\u2019s died or something. She\u2019s not responding,\u201d the woman said frantically to someone outside the restroom door.</p><p>\u201cDid you look under the stall?\u201d a man asked, his voice darkly controlled.</p><p>Alicia glanced at the bottom of the stall door. If anyone peered underneath, they\u2019d see her. And that would be the beginning of the end. Shrieks would ensue. Her heart would fail.</p><p>\u201cNo. I... I didn\u2019t.\u201d The woman sounded a bit shaken.</p><p>The door opened, and heavier footfalls approached. A man\u2019s footfalls. Oh, God, oh God, please, please help me.</p> <p>She felt the heat race through her bones and muscles, her nerves and blood. And prayed it was the change. And not caused by the frantic panic filling her blood. That she would once again be her normal self. Normal self. She laughed at herself over that. This proved she\u2019d never be her normal self again.</p><p>Just as the footfalls ended abruptly at the stall door, the shift swiftly overtook her. She stood naked on the tile floor, the cool air conditioning sweeping across her bare skin, and she quickly squeaked out, \u201cSorry, I fainted. I\u2019m pregnant. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>It had been the only thing she could think of in her haste, remembering the time her mother had said she\u2019d passed out when she was pregnant with Alicia.</p><p>As quickly as Alicia could, she jerked her panties off the floor and yanked them on. She fumbled with her bra after that, realizing the man was still standing outside the stall door, waiting for her to open up\u2014probably in case she \u201cfainted\u201d once more. Heat again shimmered through her, but it was more of a skin-deep heat from embarrassment. If he opened the door now while she was half-naked, what in the world would he think she\u2019d been up to?</p><p>She tugged the dress over her head and decided she didn\u2019t look pregnant in the least, but she was extremely flushed and now perspiring. She was sure she looked overcome. Just like she felt.</p><p>After slipping her bare feet into her pumps, she wrenched open the stall door and smiled a diminutive, weary smile\u2014at least that\u2019s how she tried to make her expression look. Although she knew she had to look overwrought in any event.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I must have fainted again. Not enough electrolytes. My mother had warned me.\u201d She rattled off the words, feeling truly light-headed and still worried her furry wolf half might try to take over again.</p><p>Then she headed for the sink and washed her hands, just like she would have done after using the facilities, if she\u2019d used them.</p><p>The man still watched her warily, but she wasn\u2019t sure whether he thought she was lying\u2014he did look at her flat belly beneath the dress\u2014or worried she\u2019d faint again. She couldn\u2019t look at him, couldn\u2019t look to see his expression. But then a horrible thought occurred to her. What if he\u2019d thought she was doing drugs?</p><p>She took a couple of steps forward, then grabbed his arm as if she might pass out again, and this time the expression on his face was one of pure horror. Not that she was faking much of anything. Her head wouldn\u2019t quit spinning.</p><p>He grabbed her around the waist and sputtered, \u201cD-do you need an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. I haven\u2019t been eating enough. Or drinking enough fluids. I\u2019ll... I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>Still, he didn\u2019t let her go, and for the first time in her life, she really wished she had a hero type like him\u2014like Jake, rather\u2014in her life. Practical, no nonsense, she\u2019d never really felt she\u2019d needed anyone. But now?</p><p>\u201cGet her something to drink,\u201d the man said quickly to the woman hovering near the door.</p><p>Alicia sighed. She really needed help. Then she felt a wave of depression hit all at once. How could she see Jake or anyone when she was a damn werewolf? Wouldn\u2019t she want to do to him what Ferdinand did to her? Bite him? Change him? Make him live like she had to live? Her heart sinking into a pit of despair, she knew she couldn\u2019t get in touch with Jake directly. Not now, not ever.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we can\u2019t call someone for you?\u201d the man asked as he helped her toward the restroom door.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>The woman who had sold her the photograph had stepped into the restroom now, too, with the picture wrapped in paper cradled in her arms. She pointedly looked at the envelope half-sticking out of Alicia\u2019s purse.</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d the woman asked quietly, as if she thought Jake was the father of Alicia\u2019s baby and they\u2019d had a falling-out. The other woman must have told her what had happened.</p><p>Poor Jake. He was now thought to be the father of a nonexistent baby, and he was truly the dream lover of a woman who was part wolf.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Alicia said again, almost sounding desperate.</p><p>The man and women shared concerned, knowing looks.</p><p>The man continued to help Alicia out of the restroom, and she did really feel shaky from nearly being caught in the altogether as a wolf. He must have sensed her unsteadiness and held on tighter. When they left the restroom, the other female employee had a cell phone in one hand and a chilled bottle of water in the other, ready to call 9-1-1 probably, and everyone was looking a lot more worried than irritated about leaving work late.</p><p>That still bothered Alicia. She hated that she really had inconvenienced them. But Ferdinand was the one to blame for all this. Damn his black soul.</p><p>\u201cMary said you were trying to locate Jake Silver,\u201d the man remarked.</p><p>\u201cI gave her the envelope he left for her.\u201d Mary pointed at the incriminating evidence in Alicia\u2019s purse pocket, halfway exposed.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have an address?\u201d The man sounded really annoyed with Jake, so Alicia figured he thought Jake was the father of her faux baby, too. How could things get into such a mess?</p><p>\u201cA phone number,\u201d Alicia said. \u201cI\u2019m to call him.\u201d She tried to sound as enthusiastic as she could under the circumstances.</p><p>The man and the two women exchanged glances. They thought Jake was a villain.</p><p>\u201cHe has a home in Silver Town, Colorado,\u201d Mary blurted out, as if she wanted Alicia to know the truth in case Jake had steered her wrong.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Alicia said very sweetly.</p><p>Maybe she could call Silver Town and leave a message with someone else to get word to him that she was all right, and that would be it. But she didn\u2019t dare call Jake directly because she was afraid he\u2019d try to locate her\u2014and what a disaster that would be.</p><p>The man helped her to a chair, and the woman gave her the water. Alicia only wanted to leave as quickly as she could before she had another damnable urge to shift. Politely, she drank a little of the water, never being one who could drink a glass of anything in a hurry. But she was trying her damnedest while everyone watched her expectantly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They didn\u2019t seem interested in leaving either, instead being more concerned about her welfare. God, what a fraud she was. She was three-quarters of the way through the bottle of water when she had to go to the bathroom. She could make it to her hotel if she hurried.</p><p>\u201cThanks so much, and I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019ve made you late for closing.\u201d Rising from the chair, she cradled her purse and the nearly finished bottle of water in her arms.</p><p>They all looked at the bottle as if it held magic water and if she didn\u2019t drink all of it, she\u2019d pass out again.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be all right?\u201d the man asked, his hand outstretched in rescue mode.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m feeling so much better.\u201d She started to move toward the door.</p><p>\u201cCould one of us drive you home?\u201d the man asked. \u201cOne of us could follow behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need one of us to follow you home?\u201d Mary asked, clutching the framed photograph in her arms.</p> <p>\u201cNo, really. I\u2019m all right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Well, I\u2019ll walk with you out to your car,\u201d Mary said.</p><p>The man and other woman did also, and when Alicia had settled herself behind the steering wheel, Mary handed her the wrapped, framed photograph of the wood lilies, casting her another look of sympathy while the man and woman watched her gravely. Alicia thanked them all profusely.</p><p>When she drove out of the parking space, Alicia noted in her rearview mirror that they were still watching her. Mary shook her head.</p><p>Poor Jake when he returned to the gallery. What if they made him remove his photographs? They wouldn\u2019t do that to him. They couldn\u2019t do that. Alicia let out her breath. She could write and tell them how much she loved their gallery and that when she had more money, she\u2019d buy another one of his photos. That would work, wouldn\u2019t it?</p><p>Either that, or they\u2019d think she was in love with Jake and pining over him but he was trying to call it quits with her. She felt bad all over again. She hoped she hadn\u2019t ruined his reputation with the art gallery.</p> <p>A car\u2019s headlights followed her through town, and she had the creepy feeling the vehicle was following her. Call it woman\u2019s intuition, a sixth sense, wolf wariness. She\u2019d considered leaving without her bags, but she couldn\u2019t. Besides, she was dying to go to the bathroom.</p><p>She pulled into her parking lot, hurried out of the car, used the bathroom, and then grabbed her bags to leave the hotel she\u2019d already paid for. With every intention of leaving Breckenridge for good, she returned to the car, dumped her bags in the trunk, and headed out of town.</p><p>Again, she felt as though she was being followed, but when she left town, the car turned off down a rural road. Relieved, she figured she\u2019d stay in the next town of Crestview. But the concern lingered\u2014what if Mario could still pull strings and send men after her even from prison? Or what if the men who\u2019d killed Ferdinand Massaro in his townhouse had somehow learned she\u2019d witnessed his death? Although she couldn\u2019t know who they were, they wouldn\u2019t know that. And she would be a loose end easily tied up.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>She was his obsession. An aphrodisiac Jake Silver had little control over. The dark-haired siren of his dreams. Alicia Greiston.</p><p>And just as with last night and every night for the past seven weeks since she\u2019d first appeared to him in his dreams, seducing him with her mouth, her eyes, her touch, he sought her out. In his nighttime fantasies. Because, as real as she was, he knew the visions of her were only dreams. But she had been real, and he wanted the real woman again. He\u2019d hoped and prayed she\u2019d go to the art gallery and get the envelope he\u2019d left for her, then call. But she hadn\u2019t yet.</p><p>As much as he hated to admit it, he was ready to turn in for the night just to be with her. But as soon as it was light out, he was returning to Breckenridge to search for her again. She hadn\u2019t even returned to the florist shop to leave wreaths in memory of her mother. That would have worried him more if he didn\u2019t keep dreaming of her. She had to still be alive.</p><p>Tired and out of sorts, Jake was ready to skip dinner. The questioning sidelong glances his younger triplet brother, Tom, gave him, plus the more openly concerned looks his older brother, Darien, cast at him were enough to curb his appetite. As pack leader of Silver Town, Colorado, Darien was always concerned about the pack members\u2019 well-being. And since he was Jake\u2019s brother, Darien\u2019s concern about him was heightened. Added to that, Darien\u2019s mate, Lelandi, was analyzing Jake\u2019s behavior based on the psychology courses she was taking. Jake felt as if he was a proverbial open book for everyone to read.</p> <p>Except he would not let them know why he wasn\u2019t sleeping. Hell, at the very least, if he died from lack of sleep, it would be with a smile on his face.</p><p>What gnawed at him most was that Darien had said the dream mating that had occurred between him and Lelandi before they had met was fate and that their family had a history of such occurrences. Which Jake couldn\u2019t believe in.</p><p>Yet the truth of the matter was that he felt as though he was linked with Alicia through his nighttime fantasies, which couldn\u2019t be. She was human. The lack of sleep was driving him slowly mad.</p><p>Except for the clinking of forks as Tom and Darien scooped up their mashed potatoes and gravy, the dining room was silent. Then Lelandi spoke up. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine at the leather-goods factory, right?\u201d She had asked Darien, but her gaze again slid to Jake, as if she thought something was bothering him about some trouble with the factory.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine,\u201d Darien said, \u201cEverywhere. No pack problems at present, no problems with the mine. The town is running without any difficulties, and the factory\u2019s doing well. Just as everything should be.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi set her half-eaten slice of bread on her plate and rubbed her belly. She was due this fall; another month and she would have the triplets. That was making Jake antsy. And he felt guilty about it. All pack members revered the pack leaders\u2019 offspring. They took care of them and provided for them, just as they did other pack members\u2019 children. Yet, as much as he hated himself for it, he felt twinges of jealousy for his older brother when he\u2019d never felt that way before.</p><p>Normally, Lelandi was beautiful and glowed with motherhood, her red hair spilling over her shoulders, her green eyes bright with laughter. But now, she seemed just as concerned as his brothers. They wouldn\u2019t prod him too hard. But Lelandi? She was bound to ask him before long what was wrong. And he didn\u2019t want to lie. But he wasn\u2019t telling her the truth, either.</p><p>He respected her for bringing Darien out of the deep pit of despair he\u2019d been wallowing in. And with the impending birth of their children, she certainly didn\u2019t need to be worrying about Jake.</p><p>But then she smiled a little as if she\u2019d figured out what was bothering him. Maybe she\u2019d been able to work out the mystery intuitively, or maybe he\u2019d given himself away. Or maybe it was something altogether different. He still couldn\u2019t read her like he could his brothers and they, him. Although he was certain they couldn\u2019t figure out his behavior right now.</p><p>Lelandi turned her attention to Tom and lifted her bread from her plate again. \u201cWoman trouble?\u201d</p><p>Tom immediately glanced at Jake. Hell, Jake didn\u2019t have woman problems, except in the form of a damned beguiling woman who continued to appear to him in his dreams, and who in the worst-case scenario had gotten into trouble with the Mob. Lesser worst-case scenario, she\u2019d just stood him up. Jake scowled further.</p><p>Tom gave a small smile. \u201cCan\u2019t have any woman trouble if there\u2019s no one around to give me difficulty.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi looked at Jake, but she didn\u2019t repeat the question, although it lingered in the air as if it hung invisibly between them, begging to be answered. He imagined his expression said she\u2019d better not pose the question.</p><p>But damned if both of his brothers didn\u2019t look to him to answer her query as if she\u2019d blatantly asked him. He finished his meal, not intending to be drawn into this, took the plate to the kitchen, rinsed it off, put it in the dishwasher, and then returned to the dining room.</p><p>All three watched him.</p><p>He paused, thinking to ask them about dream mating\u2014could it involve a human woman? But not wanting to get into a discussion about this when he was dog tired, he said instead, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>The looks they all gave him showed surprise. If they\u2019d worn watches, which as lupus garous they didn\u2019t, he figured they\u2019d all be glancing at them now to determine just how late it was. And see that it was way too early for him to retire when he normally didn\u2019t hit the sack until midnight. Unless he went for a midnight run as a wolf in the woods. Then it was even later.</p><p>Darien cleared his throat. \u201cDo you want to talk to me privately about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And there\u2019s no sense in putting this off any longer,\u201d Jake remarked, not intending to mention it again, but it was time. He\u2019d been renovating their grandfather\u2019s home, which was situated farther from town than Darien\u2019s house. The renovations were complete, and it was past time to settle in there.</p><p>Tom cast a glance at Lelandi. She\u2019d been the one attempting all along to convince him to change his mind. Darien and Tom knew better than to try.</p><p>\u201cI told you and Tom, both, you don\u2019t need to leave. Just because the babies are coming, I don\u2019t want you feeling like they\u2019re pushing you out of your own home,\u201d Lelandi said softly, her eyes welling up with tears, her throat choked with emotion.</p><p>Hell. She wasn\u2019t often emotional, but with being pregnant, she\u2019d had unnatural bouts of weepiness, which was another reason he couldn\u2019t stay. He hated to see her cry\u2014especially when he had anything to do with it.</p><p>Darien reached over and took her hand and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cThe cabin is so... isolated. It has electricity and running water, but no television or telephone service. It\u2019s so primitive. What if you run into trouble out there?\u201d she asked, quickly dabbing with a napkin at tears trailing down her cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew her well enough to realize she didn\u2019t use the tears to make him feel guilty, even though they still had that effect. No matter how many times she cajoled him to stay, he couldn\u2019t. He thought Tom was waffling, though. That was fine with Jake. He didn\u2019t mind living at the house alone since he\u2019d only be there at night. He\u2019d spend his days working with the family, with the pack, and still have dinner with them unless he just had to get away. He was a family kind of guy, and that wouldn\u2019t ever change. He\u2019d told Lelandi that, and he wasn\u2019t going to repeat himself.</p><p>But something deeper was bothering him. The need to have a mate. He was seeing Darien and Lelandi together with the babies coming, and now the damnable dreams of Alicia were making him crazy. He had to get away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need more room,\u201d he said, and headed out of the dining room before anyone could say anything further to him.</p> <p>He knew they\u2019d all be giving each other looks, trying to figure out what was wrong with him, staying silent until he was well beyond earshot, and then discussing his actions in private.</p><p>He heard Darien\u2019s phone ring and hoped there wasn\u2019t trouble he had to take care of with the pack or town tonight, considering how much he wanted to sleep\u2014dream, rather.</p><p>Why was he going to bed this early? Depression, Lelandi might surmise from her psychology classes. Never in a millennium would she or anyone else guess that he couldn\u2019t sleep because of his desire for a woman\u2019s silken touch.</p><p>\u201cYou need to speak with Jake?\u201d Darien said in the dining room to whoever was on the phone, his voice sounding surprised.</p><p>Jake paused in the great room before he reached the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s here. Let me let you talk to him.\u201d Normally Darien would have hollered to him that the call was for him, although why anyone would be calling him on Darien\u2019s line was a mystery. But instead, Darien left the dining room to join Jake in the great room, and that didn\u2019t bode well.</p><p>Already he was thinking that something bad had happened to Alicia. Although how anyone knew their connection, he couldn\u2019t be sure. Unless she\u2019d been hurt and the gallery staff had made the correlation.</p><p>Darien held his hand over the mouthpiece on the phone. \u201cSheriff got a call from Breckenridge.\u201d</p><p>Already apprehensive, Jake could feel his legs turning to rubber, and he was sure his face had drained of all color, as light-headed as he felt. As observant as he always was, Darien noticed and frowned. \u201cHell, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Darien raised his brows, then shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got some talking to do. An Alicia Greiston passed out in the art gallery\u2019s ladies\u2019 restroom after she bought one of your photographs. Apparently, she\u2019s pregnant. But they said you\u2019d left your number for her to get in touch. Your cell phone must be off so they called our sheriff, trying to locate another number for you, and Peter gave them mine. What\u2019s this all about?\u201d</p> <p>Pregnant?</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t wait for Jake\u2019s answer, but handed him the phone and remained watching him like a wary wolf.</p><p>His heart in his throat and worried as hell about Alicia, Jake said, \u201cHello, this is Jake Silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mary Clebourne from the art gallery in Breckenridge. I\u2019m the one who gave you the contract on your work. I just wanted to let you know I gave your girlfriend your phone number like you asked me to, and she said she\u2019d call you. Has she called you? We\u2019ve been worried about her. She passed out in the ladies\u2019 restroom. Said she was pregnant and apologized all over the place. We wanted to follow her home, but she said she\u2019d be all right. Did she call you?\u201d Mary repeated.</p><p>Girlfriend? Pregnant? \u201cNo. She didn\u2019t. When did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight. A couple of hours ago. I wanted to give her time to reach you, but then I worried she might not, so I thought I\u2019d get in touch with you just in case. Then I couldn\u2019t get hold of you and called the sheriff of Silver Town, figuring he\u2019d know your family and someone would pass the word along. But since I couldn\u2019t get hold of you, I assumed she only had the number I couldn\u2019t reach either.\u201d</p><p>Hell, the phone was charging in his bedroom. \u201cDid she mention where she was staying? Leave a phone number or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing. She said that she hadn\u2019t been drinking enough fluids. We gave her a bottle of water, and she seemed better but still awfully pale. Before the episode, she bought your tangerine wood lily photograph.\u201d</p> <p>Pregnant. Damn guy probably had left her. Hell, that\u2019s why she had been reluctant to see Jake further. But then why in the Sam Hill was she chasing down bad guys in her condition? She hadn\u2019t been showing when Jake had been with her. Maybe she hadn\u2019t known that she was pregnant right away.</p><p>The part about her buying his photograph finally registered. And he was concerned all over again. It was as if she wanted to reach out to him but was afraid to.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll be there in the morning.\u201d But he\u2019d leave after a few hours sleep, arrive way before dawn, and search for Alicia\u2019s car at hotels all over Breckenridge. Hopefully he\u2019d locate her before she had a chance to vanish again.</p><p>\u201cI just thought you should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mary. I really appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to marry her, you know. I didn\u2019t see that she had a wedding ring.\u201d</p><p>Jake glanced at Darien, knowing that with their enhanced hearing, his brother could hear what was being said through the mouthpiece.</p><p>Darien raised his brows again.</p><p>How could he tell Mary that, in werewolf fashion, they didn\u2019t marry but mated for a lifetime? And since Alicia was human, that meant turning her. But with her carrying a baby, no way in hell could he or any other wolf risk the consequences. Turning a human was chancy at best and rarely done on purpose.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mary. I\u2019ll stop by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>They ended the call, and he handed Darien his phone.</p><p>\u201cMy office,\u201d Darien suggested, although it was more of an order.</p><p>Jake knew Darien would tell Lelandi what was going on because she jointly led the pack and she had a need to know. But he didn\u2019t have to like it.</p><p>As soon as Jake shut the door to Darien\u2019s office, Darien took a seat in the sitting area instead of behind his desk.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Jake? She has a gray wolf name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s not one of us. She has a wolf\u2019s name, but you and I both know that the names we\u2019ve chosen are not exclusive to our species.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Darien leaned back in his tall leather chair. \u201cSo what\u2019s this all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s human and got into trouble at a restaurant where I had eaten breakfast while waiting for the gallery to open. The opening had been delayed. Anyway, she\u2019s a bounty hunter and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBounty hunter?\u201d Darien looked surprised as hell.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and she\u2019s after a couple of mobster types.\u201d</p><p>Darien didn\u2019t say anything for a minute, then shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant? What in the hell is she doing chasing down members of the Mob in her condition?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t voice any opinion about why Jake would have been having sex with a human woman who was pregnant. He had to figure that Jake had sense enough to know better.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t look pregnant when I saw her. She had a man under surveillance, and he\u2019d sent one of his thugs to remove her from the restaurant where I was having breakfast. So I came to her rescue. We were supposed to have lunch together, but she left before we could do so. That\u2019s why I stayed overnight. I thought either some harm had come to her after all, or she was trying to ditch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were at a motel together, though.\u201d</p><p>The shower incident came back to Jake in a vivid recollection. He frowned at his brother. Normally, that should have been his own business. He let out his breath in exasperation. \u201cShe didn\u2019t look pregnant. All right? Give me credit for having better sense than that.\u201d</p><p>Darien tapped his fingers on the arm of his chair. \u201cMaybe she broke the engagement because she wasn\u2019t showing and she was too embarrassed to tell you she was having a child out of wedlock. Or maybe she\u2019s still married. Or separated from a husband.\u201d</p><p>Jake sighed darkly. \u201cI assume it\u2019s something like that now, yes. But I\u2019m glad she\u2019s not in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re returning to Breckenridge.\u201d</p><p>When Darien\u2019s probing look changed to one of concern, Jake sat taller and ground his teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Jake? What the hell is going on between the two of you?\u201d</p><p>Jake raked his fingers through his hair and stared at the floor before he again held Darien\u2019s gaze. \u201cTell me about this dream mating that happened between you and Lelandi.\u201d</p><p>Darien\u2019s mouth parted. Then he clamped his lips tight and didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve never believed in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, Darien, I dreamed of her last night. And every night for the past seven weeks. Ever since the day she disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe human woman?\u201d Disbelief coated Darien\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cYeah, damn it. She\u2019s so real, I swear I made love to her last night. Again.\u201d</p><p>Darien looked at him thoughtfully, then shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t be happening. Must be just that you\u2019re so fascinated by her, you\u2019re dreaming about her. We can\u2019t dream mate with humans.\u201d</p><p>Jake let out his breath in exasperation. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s an anomaly. Maybe it\u2019s just a really rare occurrence. But from what you\u2019ve told me about you and Lelandi, this is the same thing that happened between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this woman\u2019s not a wolf, she\u2019s carrying a human child. You can\u2019t change a woman and her child. A woman, if the situation is dire enough, but not her unborn child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. I hadn\u2019t planned to turn her. I just want to know she\u2019s safe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Darien frowned at him. \u201cI\u2019m serious about this, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour concern is duly noted. Is that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake...\u201d Darien\u2019s tone was consoling.</p> <p>Jake didn\u2019t need consolation. He needed to see Alicia again, craved seeing her, and had to find out what had happened to her over the past seven weeks. He had to be sure she was truly safe and well.</p><p>Jake nodded. \u201cI know my place, Darien. I know what I can and can\u2019t do. See you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>His heart warring with his mind, he left Darien\u2019s office and headed for the stairs. He was past ready to move out.</p><p>He hated that a dream could make him crave someone so badly that she\u2019d keep him up half the night. Hated that he couldn\u2019t have her in the flesh the way he wanted.</p><p>She was pregnant. He just couldn\u2019t believe it.</p> <p>In his bedroom, he jerked off his clothes and dropped them on the floor. He glanced at the polished top of his dresser\u2014at the copper hair clip that had bound Alicia\u2019s satiny curls when he had made love to her in the forest in Breckenridge that one day\u2014the only physical evidence he had connecting him to her.</p><p>He yanked his bedcovers aside. No matter how much he told himself it was insane, he climbed into bed and waited for her\u2014with wretched eagerness and abject desperation.</p><p>She had it bad, Alicia thought, as she pulled off her clothes in the scroungy motel room\u2014the only motel she could find in the tiny town of Crestview\u2014and laid her things neatly over a chair. If it hadn\u2019t already been so late and she hadn\u2019t been afraid she wouldn\u2019t find another hotel with a vacancy in another town, she\u2019d have driven on.</p><p>Right now, all she wanted was to be with the man of her dreams, but she had a job to do\u2014relocate and start her life over.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t risk any of Constantino\u2019s cronies catching up to her if he thought to get revenge for her turning him in. In the future, until she could figure out another way to make a living, she\u2019d go after only bail bond jumpers with non-Italian names, to stay on the safe side. And only work during the day, although she\u2019d shifted some during the day as well, so that wasn\u2019t a guarantee of anything. But she hadn\u2019t realized that the moon was nearly full, and she suspected that\u2019s why she\u2019d felt a sudden need to shift.</p><p>Hating that she would be driving right past Silver Town tomorrow and beyond without a word to Jake, she wondered if there was another route she could take.</p> <p>Jake! She meant to at least call someone in Silver Town and leave a message that she was alive and well. But when she pulled her cell phone out of her purse, she flipped the phone open and recalled that the battery was dead. She had to charge it. She started the charge and glanced at the room phone. If she couldn\u2019t call him on her phone after taking her shower, and it would have been charging for an hour or so, she\u2019d make a long-distance room call instead.</p><p>Then with her lavender shampoo and tangerine body wash in hand, she walked into the grungy bathroom. The grout in the floor was no longer white but a dirty gray, rust stains lined the sink from a perpetually dripping faucet, and the shower curtain was covered with a light sheen of soap scum, but the floor of the porcelain tub seemed clean enough. She turned on the water, waited for it to get hot, then slipped inside to shower.</p><p>She soaped up her hair with the shampoo, wanting to wash away the past few weeks\u2019 events, going back to when she\u2019d been doing damn well. Her hands stilled in the suds on top of her head where she\u2019d piled her soapy hair. When the men had come to kill Ferdinand at his townhouse, she\u2019d smelled the cologne of the man who\u2019d entered the bedroom where she\u2019d hidden under the bed. Ferdinand had already bitten her by that time. And her sense of smell had been highly attuned. A wolf\u2019s sense of smell. Would she recognize the man\u2019s odor again?</p><p>She groaned. If he did come to get her, she\u2019d most likely recognize him because of her enhanced sense of smell and know she was a dead woman before the deed was done. Some help that would be.</p><p>She rinsed out her hair, grabbed her bottle of peach body wash and poured some on her hands, then slathered her whole body with the silky, fragrant wash. It helped disguise the unfamiliar, unwanted odors in the bathroom and hotel room.</p><p>After towel drying her hair and body, she stalked back into the bedroom, unzipped her bag, and drew out a silky blue nightie. She pulled it on, then climbed into bed and slipped between the harsh sheets. She was glad they smelled of bleach and not the last occupant\u2019s odor. Sometimes to save money and to avoid the work, the hotel staff didn\u2019t bother to change the sheets between customers. Not that she\u2019d let them get away with it.</p><p>Woe to those who didn\u2019t have a wolf\u2019s senses and couldn\u2019t detect such a thing. On the other hand, there was something to be said about the old adage\u2014Ignorance is bliss.</p><p>She closed her eyes, wanting to welcome her dream lover into her arms, and waited. Breathless with anticipation.</p> <p>The first time he had come to her, she had known it was just a dream. Very, very real, but just a dream. And she loved conjuring him up, loved making him come to her. He was every bit as much an addiction as chocolate\u2014the really rich dark kind.</p><p>She breathed in the stale air, the smell of bleached sheets, the faint odor of cigarette smoke in what was supposed to be a nonsmoking room, the dustiness. Felt the scratchy sheets against her bare skin and the equally scratchy comforter decorated in brown palm trees that probably had never been washed, noted the picture of palm trees nailed to the wall\u2014and wondered if the Colorado motel owner fantasized about having a resort in Florida. She hated not being in her own bedroom on her comfortable saggy mattress, the sheets super soft, and having her pillow, too.</p><p>But she was afraid if she returned there for very long, they\u2019d catch up to her. If she could, she\u2019d clean out her bank account, give notice, take as much from her apartment as she could fit into her car, and leave the rest behind with no forwarding address. Although she\u2019d worked hard to afford her furniture, and she hated having to abandon it.</p><p>Sometime during the night, as the heat of the day subsided and a dry coolness filled the room, she began to slip off to the world of sleep.</p><p>Vaguely she became aware of another presence in her room.</p><p>At first, a peculiar sense of recognition washed over her, reassuring her that she was safe, that whoever or whatever she was sensing wouldn\u2019t harm her.</p><p>Then she saw him, materializing in the darkness like a shadowed lover. Distractedly, she remembered the phone call she hadn\u2019t made. Damn. Tomorrow, first thing.</p><p>Jake approached, and she forgot everything else but him.</p><p>Advancing, his hair the color of rich, dark-brown earth after a summer rain, his eyes of the same shade and darkly intense, his masculine lips curved up faintly in the hint of a smile, he moved toward her in a slow, methodical, predatory way. In the past few weeks, when her world seemed only to be spiraling downhill faster, only Jake had made her life bearable after that fateful night she\u2019d been turned. And she wanted him at night, every night, for as long as she lived, which might not be very long the way things were going.</p><p>Naked, he flexed his muscles, stood a little taller, and saw her and only her. Still covered in the comforter up to her neck because of the chill in the air, she gave him a refrained smile back. It was always the same. An acknowledgment that they were here in concert for this, but no wild throwing themselves together in the heat of the moment. Deep down, she felt it was because she feared that if she did leap from the bed and jump into his waiting arms, he\u2019d just vanish. Poof. And never come again.</p><p>So she waited for him, waited for his large capable fingers to pull back the comforter, to feel his hands lifting her gown off her. He always started with his gentle, then urgent strokes, his lips and tongue teasing her, his mouth on her breast.</p><p>But this time he seemed hesitant. She frowned a little. He couldn\u2019t leave her now. Not when he was the only bright spot in her life. A too-real figment of her imagination.</p><p>He raked his fingers through his hair. She parted her lips as if to speak. She never had spoken to him before. Had never needed to. Didn\u2019t think she really could. But he seemed so unsure, as if he was reevaluating why he was here.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t. He was here because she made him come. She pulled her arms free from the comforter and was about to stretch them out to him, to encourage him to join her. How could he come to her and then decide he couldn\u2019t do this?</p><p>And then he sighed, although she never could hear sounds in her dreams, except for the blood rushing in her ears, her own panting breath when he stroked her into submission, her heart beating wildly. Her smile widened.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t smile back. Still reserved, she thought. Still bothered by something. Yet he approached her with an aggressive stride, yanked the covers aside, and stared at her belly, the pale blue gown she wore having risen to her thighs. Her naked legs didn\u2019t hold his attention, but his gaze focused on her waist. He slid the silky fabric up her thighs, past her hips, higher until her belly was exposed, then kissed her there. She wasn\u2019t sure how to read his actions, but then she reached for him, spread her legs willingly, opened herself to him, and encouraged him to join her.</p><p>He climbed onto the bed, situating himself between her legs, but kept his weight off her as he tackled her mouth with his. His kiss was hard and fierce, his jaw lightly whiskered and rough. If she didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d swear she\u2019d have whisker burns on her cheeks after they made love. His tongue dove into her mouth, impatient, impassioned, and she met his craving move for move. God, he was beautiful and she desired him with all her heart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only good thing in my life,\u201d she mouthed against his lips, wishing there could be more to their relationship than this.</p><p>He paused, staring at her with such intensity that it was as if he\u2019d truly heard her words and felt her sentiment, and then he kissed her hard again. His hand encompassed a breast, fondled, and stroked, caressed her nipple with the pad of his thumb, teasing the tip, which was tingling and aching with need. Her breasts were slightly tender, fuller, more sensitive to his touch. Then his mouth moved down her throat, and he brushed his lips across her sensitive skin, licking her there. He seemed desperate with wanting her, just as much as she felt about him. His hand stroked her deeply between her legs, where she was already hot and wet and swollen for him, her core aching with such an intensity that she could barely last. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She envisioned she was still at home in her own bed with the man in her dreams making wild passionate love with her. His fingers dipped in between her legs, caressing her into climax while she gripped his waist and never wanted to let go.</p><p>She felt the earth shift, the bed, the room, the whole world as she reached the peak and shattered with the most riveting ecstasy. Vaguely, she felt his fingers withdraw before he filled her with his arousal, hard and hot and very much ready for action.</p><p>But this time he raised her legs over his shoulders for maximum penetration and dove into her with hard, deep, satisfying thrusts, his face dipping to kiss her breast, to lick the nipple, her hands running through his hair as she moaned with satisfaction. He knew how to give her pleasure like she\u2019d never felt before. His lusty gaze shifted to hers. His expression was still dark, and she couldn\u2019t read it now. Before, he\u2019d always been so pleased with her, to see her, to be with her, but now... something was amiss. As if he was tired of playing this game. But he was hers, her dream. He had to be here for her whenever she drifted off to her fantasy world of dreams.</p> <p>She moaned as he stole her thoughts, brought her rising again on another tidal wave of pleasure, had her grasping for his sinewy arms, and he groaned, pumping into her until he was spent, then collapsed and didn\u2019t move. He was heavy and sweaty and felt protective and manly and wonderful.</p><p>He lay there for some time, and at first she thought her dream lover had fallen asleep, but then he lifted his head, sighed, and rolled off her, then pulled her into his arms and held her tight. He kissed the top of her head, caressing her arm with a soft touch. He\u2019d kiss her and caress her and nap and take her again and again all night long, and by morning, he\u2019d be gone, and she\u2019d still miss him. Until the night returned.</p><p>She\u2019d started taking naps during the day to manage the nights. But a vaguely ominous worry crept into the dream. She couldn\u2019t shake loose of the feeling that Jake was in danger\u2014and all because of her.</p><p>But then something else seized her attention. A sound. Not a key, but... something... like... the sound of a plastic card being slipped between the doorjamb and the door with a hard whooshing, sliding sound.</p><p>Like someone was trying to break into her room.</p> <p>Chapter 10</p><p>Alicia was cloaked in the warmth of her dream state, still wrapped in Jake\u2019s arms when he turned to look at the rickety motel-room door that could easily have been shattered with a swift booted kick. His hand froze in midcaress along Alicia\u2019s arm, as if he could recognize that someone was trying to break into her room. Then he set Alicia aside, climbed out of bed, and stalked toward the door like her knight without his armor.</p><p>For a second, she didn\u2019t know what to do. Get dressed, her mind shouted at her. Get her gun, do something\u2014before Jake is killed.</p><p>Her heart had picked up into a flight-or-fight mode, and the adrenaline was already pouring through her veins. But she couldn\u2019t move. She was frozen in place, only able to stare at him and at the door.</p><p>Then she felt her mind awakening. She was still in a dream. Jake wasn\u2019t really here!</p><p>Still half-asleep, she tried to break free of the dreamy fog that shrouded her mind. If she didn\u2019t fully wake from the dream, whoever was trying to break into the scuzzy room would be in soon, and she could be in real danger.</p> <p>Unless... she sighed deeply... that was only part of the dream.</p><p>The card scraping between the door and frame sounded louder, more urgent, and she opened her eyes in disbelief. She sat up in bed, pulling completely free of the dream, and found herself alone, but the plastic card continued to jerk up and down in the doorjamb in an attempt to disengage the lock.</p><p>Heart pounding as if she was running a race, she quickly considered her options as she thrust her covers aside and got out of bed.</p><p>If she turned into the wolf, she could face the would-be intruder with a set of frighteningly wicked canines. He\u2019d most likely believe she was someone\u2019s guard dog. And run like hell. Or she could get her gun, which she was still licensed to carry. But it was in her bag on the other side of the room. She might not be able to shift. She\u2019d never tried to force herself to shift into the wolf, only to shift back into her human form. That knowledge sent a prickle of worry skittering over her skin.</p><p>Naked, she sprinted across the room, only to reach her bag when the lock clicked open on the door. Thoroughly immobilized, she shifted her gaze to the doorknob. And prayed her ability to shift would kick in.</p><p>To her profound relief, she felt the shift coming on. With heat suffusing every cell, her bones and skin and muscles painlessly melted into what felt like heated taffy\u2014like her grandmother, God rest her soul, had made when she lived with Alicia and her mother.</p><p>In the next instant, Alicia was standing as a gray wolf next to a small dresser, her fur fluffed in offensive mode to make her appear larger and more threatening, her ears twitching back and forth, listening for every sound the intruder made, her tail straight out, her eyes focused on the door, her mouth still closed. She backed even farther into the dark corner.</p><p>A human couldn\u2019t see her in the lightless room. Not unless light reflected off her eyes. And then? Her eyes could appear to glow yellow, green, or even red, she\u2019d noticed when she\u2019d glanced in a mirror one night and thought, \u201cHow cool.\u201d</p> <p>But she\u2019d never bitten a human before, or a wolf for that matter, and the only notion she had was that she\u2019d snarl and growl and look threatening. If he had a gun, though, would he be all that scared?</p><p>Getting shot didn\u2019t appeal. They\u2019d broken Ferdinand\u2019s neck, so she knew she could die in more ways than just by a silver bullet. She laughed at herself over that. Would a silver bullet really kill, or was that strictly fantasy?</p><p>She remained quiet and watched, seething that this creep would break into her room. Yet it reminded her of the thugs who\u2019d come to Ferdinand\u2019s apartment, threatened him, and then killed him. Killed the other man he knew, too. If they had known she was there in his apartment, hiding under the bed, she was certain she would have faced the same death.</p><p>The door remained closed while her heart pounded pell-mell. What was he waiting for? Was he afraid? Waiting to see if she responded with a phone call to 9-1-1?</p><p>She glanced at her phone. Still charging. But if it had a partial charge, she could still use it.</p><p>The door opened just a hair, then farther, with no squeaking, no sound, except that she could hear heavy breathing and hearts pounding, both hers and his. He was scared. As much as she hated to admit it, so was she.</p><p>The door opened a little wider. A pinprick of illumination poked into the blackness from a flashlight. The lamp on the outside wall appeared to be out. It hadn\u2019t been when she\u2019d checked into her room, so the intruder must have knocked it out and was working virtually blind.</p><p>The flashlight\u2019s faint beam was pointed in the direction of the bed, but it didn\u2019t stretch farther than a few inches and so didn\u2019t reach beyond the door, which still shielded her view of the intruder.</p><p>With what appeared to be fresh resolve, he moved quickly beyond the door, headed for the bed with flashlight and gun poised. Shit. He was armed and looked like he wanted to play really rough.</p><p>Despite the black hoodie hiding his hair and some of his profile, she saw his large hooked nose, and he looked damn familiar. She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>The creep that had tried to force her out of the restaurant in Breckenridge before Jake came to her aid. The same one who had been with the man she\u2019d shot on the trail where she\u2019d laid her mother\u2019s memorial wreath. His light flicked over the empty bed, the covers tossed aside. His flashlight swept over the chair where her clothes now lay. Hell. He would know she was still in the room. That she hadn\u2019t gone out to party. Party, right. The town boasted one rickety motel, and the whole place looked to have rolled up the sidewalks hours before sunset.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the bathroom. She barely breathed. Not once looking in her direction, he headed slowly for the bathroom.</p><p>Had he followed her all the way here from Breckenridge? She wondered if he\u2019d watched her when she arrived at the hotel and then waited until she\u2019d taken her shower, turned out the lights, and climbed into bed. Maybe waited until sufficient time had passed for her to fall asleep. Or had he just located her car and was working blind?</p><p>She didn\u2019t think she had enough time to shape-shift and then dress and bolt from the room, start the car, and leave. No, she knew she didn\u2019t have time for all that.</p><p>The thought of running out of here in her wolf form terrified her. She wasn\u2019t equipped to deal with the wolf angle in the wild. She didn\u2019t want to leave her car behind or her other possessions. And if she bolted out of here, the thug would discover that Alicia, the woman, wasn\u2019t here and most likely would wait for her to return.</p><p>He slid the shower curtain aside with a swift jerk, the metal rings sliding across the metal pole with a scratching sound.</p><p>Now he knew for certain she wasn\u2019t in there, and he\u2019d come out, maybe try looking under the bed, or maybe glance in her direction and see her standing here as a wolf, staring him down in the dark.</p><p>He\u2019d shoot her, and no one would ever know she\u2019d disappeared, and no one would even care.</p><p>She changed her mind and was able to summon the shift again\u2014to her astonishment and guarded relief\u2014before he left the bathroom. Maybe having been a werewolf for seven weeks with a couple of weeklong breaks and then the trouble she\u2019d had with it earlier, like she\u2019d just had to get used to it again, had finally enabled her to get some control over this shape-shifting business.</p><p>She grabbed the gun from her purse.</p><p>As soon as the pinprick of light headed out of the bathroom and he followed, she wondered if she had made another mistake and should have stayed in her wolf form. Standing naked with only a gun in her hand for defense made her feel horribly vulnerable.</p><p>But then again, she could see well in the dark while he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>That\u2019s when he must have caught a glimpse of her, and he aimed his weapon with cold-bloodedness. She\u2019d already anticipated his action and moved right before he fired a shot. The round hit the wall behind her, and she fired three times, all three slugs hitting something solid. His only response was a grunt, then he slid down the wall, leaving a trail of blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, God. She stared at him in disbelief as the acrid odor of gun smoke wafted through the air. How could this thug do this to her? The past few weeks had already been bad enough!</p><p>Then she shifted her attention to the open door. What if there were more of them? What if he wasn\u2019t acting alone? They never acted alone. At least she didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>Her hands shaking, she quickly shoved her gun in her purse, sprinted across the floor, and closed the door, locking it\u2014although that hadn\u2019t done a lot of good before. She rushed to the man and checked his wrist and then his neck for a pulse. None.</p> <p>She returned to her suitcase, pulled out black jeans and a black sweatshirt, and hurriedly jerked them on.</p><p>She looked back at the man, his mouth open, his eyes staring lifelessly at her, his head leaning against the wall.</p><p>Dead. He was dead.</p><p>Perspiration trickled down her breasts despite the cool air, and she rubbed her arms as her heart continued to beat at a racer\u2019s pace. God, what was she to do now?</p><p>She had to call this in to the police, as much as she didn\u2019t want to. If any of this guy\u2019s buddies were about, and she hung around to meet with the police, she\u2019d be dead meat. And no number of police in this rinky-dink little town could protect her. If they even had any police here.</p> <p>But she was one of the good guys, she had to remind herself. She couldn\u2019t kill a man and leave the scene of the crime without just cause.</p><p>She paced.</p><p>Hell, if she didn\u2019t call it in, someone else in the motel was sure to have heard the gunshots and would dial 9-1-1, and then the police would question her as to why she hadn\u2019t called it in. She would sound guiltier than she already felt. Even though he had broken into her room and tried to kill her first.</p><p>She jerked the phone off the hook next to the bed and punched in the number, then lifted the receiver to her ear. An eerie silence met her ear. The line was dead. Another spiral of fear cascaded down her spine. He\u2019d cut the phone lines. This was so not good.</p><p>Then she heard two car doors open and shut just outside her room. Either a couple of legitimate hotel guests were arriving late for the night... or they were cohorts of the dead guy. She was certain she wasn\u2019t hearing the police because it would be too soon for them to arrive and no police lights were flashing outside the window.</p><p>She stood frozen with indecision and went back to her earlier plan. Change into the wolf, or hope that, fortified with only a gun, she could be as lucky against two armed men, if that\u2019s what she faced, as she had been against one. With the way her luck was going, she was sure it had just completely run out. She raced across the floor, grabbed her cell phone, and flipped it open. Thank God, it had a little bit of a charge.</p> <p>After punching in 9-1-1, she watched the door, waiting for someone to answer the phone, waiting for anyone to touch the doorknob. Then in her panic, she couldn\u2019t remember. Had she locked the door?</p><p>The doorknob twisted. Her heart thundered.</p><p>Someone spoke into her ear, \u201cSheriff\u2019s department. What is the nature of your emergency?\u201d</p><p>Alicia nearly dropped the phone in surprise at hearing the woman\u2019s deeply brusque voice.</p><p>The doorknob didn\u2019t twist any farther. It was locked. Alicia didn\u2019t say anything into the phone, afraid that if she did, whoever was trying to gain entrance into her room would hear her. Which was probably crazy. He had to have figured she\u2019d killed the other thug already.</p><p>Startling her, the woman repeated the question, more insistent this time. \u201cThis is the sheriff\u2019s department. What is the nature of your emergency?\u201d</p><p>Alicia licked her lips and said in a whisper, \u201cSomeone broke into my motel. Crest\u2014\u201d</p><p>But the miniscule relief Alicia felt that the person at the door couldn\u2019t open it without unlocking it didn\u2019t last long. A strong kick at the door broke a lower section of the paneling away, the crash making Alicia jump back.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re trying to kill me! Crestview Motel. They\u2019re breaking in!\u201d she shouted, the need for secrecy a moot point, as she hoped the sheriff\u2019s department was close by. But she hadn\u2019t seen any sign of one when she had stopped there for the night.</p><p>She dropped the phone, still open, still charging, on the dresser, but she didn\u2019t have any more time to speak to the operator.</p><p>The woman was trying to get her attention. \u201cMiss, stay on the line. What\u2019s happening? Police are being dispatched to your location. Your name?\u201d</p><p>So they could identify her in the event these men killed her and stole her identity? Or took off with her and left her for dead in some deserted place? What would it matter then?</p><p>Alicia decided that, for better or worse, she\u2019d shift\u2014if she could. She thought she was really getting the hang of this, and she figured it was her only chance.</p><p>She tugged out of her clothes and dropped them on the floor. The woman on the phone kept talking to her, although Alicia\u2019s attention was riveted to the door, where the man kept kicking at the splintering wood, while she tried to force herself to shape-shift again. She couldn\u2019t make out the woman\u2019s words over her own.</p><p>\u201cShift, damn it,\u201d Alicia ordered herself. \u201cNow. Shift.\u201d</p><p>Fresh fear rippled through her. What if she could only shift so many times in so many hours?</p><p>Yet it was her only chance. If she could startle the intruder enough when he saw her as a wolf, she might manage to flee past him and run into the woods surrounding the small town.</p><p>And then? She didn\u2019t know what to do, just get away from here as far as possible, find a way to steal some clothes, shift, and then keep moving on to somewhere new and different and far, far away from the life she had known.</p><p>Jake was already pacing as he dressed. He knew the woman in his dreams was real, if Darien\u2019s dreaming of Lelandi was any indication. And Jake knew Alicia was in trouble, damn it. Yet he couldn\u2019t reach out to her, couldn\u2019t learn where she was or what had happened to her. She wasn\u2019t in the usual places, the nicer hotel rooms with large beds and mirrors and pictures and dressers.</p><p>In his dream, she\u2019d been in a dirty, rundown motel, he guessed. The bed had been covered with a comforter of brown palm trees, hideous and garish, along with the picture of palm trees on the wall. Yet... he didn\u2019t sense it was Florida. Why not Florida? Because Mary from the art gallery hadn\u2019t called him that long ago. He didn\u2019t believe Alicia would have had time to reach an airport by car, then fly to Florida and get a room.</p><p>The phone book. Sitting on the bedside table in Alicia\u2019s room, it had \u201cCrestview\u201d printed on the front. That was a town one hour southeast of Silver Town.</p><p>And someone had been about to break in.</p><p>He called Silver Town\u2019s sheriff, waking him from a dead sleep. \u201cPeter, call the sheriff who oversees Crestview. See if a woman has called in a 9-1-1. Get back with me ASAP.\u201d</p><p>He clicked off the phone and headed into the hall. Everyone in the family was still asleep. He didn\u2019t intend to wake them if it was all a wild-goose chase. How in the hell could he explain he was attempting the rescue of a woman from his dreams? Darien didn\u2019t even believe Jake could be dreaming of her for real. Not as his dream mate. Not when she was human.</p><p>But how else could he explain the motel room and the phone book, when he\u2019d only passed through the nearly nonexistent town a few times during his life? He was climbing into his truck when Peter called him back.</p><p>\u201cThere was a 9-1-1 call from the Crestview Motel, just like you said. The caller was a woman who said men were breaking in and were going to kill her. The operator said loud bangs could be heard in the background, and she figured a man was trying to break down the door. But she couldn\u2019t get anything more from the woman. Then shots were fired.\u201d</p><p>Hell. \u201cAnd?\u201d Jake was already barreling down the highway toward Silver Town and would go south on the road toward Crestview from there.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Alicia Greiston, with an e-i rather than an a-y.\u201d</p><p>Jake felt sick to his stomach. \u201cWas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure. She\u2019s gone. By the time the sheriff got there, he found one dead male, his torso riddled with three bullets, and a bullet wedged in the wall across the room. Her purse, clothes, gun, pepper spray, and stun gun were there, and her still-active cell phone was charging on top of one of the dressers, but there was no sign of the woman. And her car is still locked and parked at the motel, driver\u2019s side window bashed in. The car battery was gone, so she wouldn\u2019t have been going anywhere in the car anyway, if she\u2019d tried. Either the man who was dead had broken into the room, and she ran off, or there were others and they\u2019ve taken her.\u201d</p><p>He cursed under his breath, not liking any of the scenarios. \u201cAlicia.\u201d Jake frowned.</p><p>Peter hurriedly said, \u201cWhat did you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, nothing. I\u2019m heading out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad she called you?\u201d</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Peter cleared his throat. \u201cThe woman who called from that art gallery in Breckenridge said she gave Alicia Greiston your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but Alicia didn\u2019t call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone line was cut to the room, and the cell phone was being charged, so she might not have been able to earlier. But how did you know she needed help if she didn\u2019t call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily thing,\u201d Jake said vaguely.</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Peter. If I need backup, I\u2019ll give you and Darien a ring.\u201d He wanted to tell Peter not to inform his brother, but Darien was the pack leader and if Peter thought Darien needed to know about this, he\u2019d fill him in. And Jake knew Peter would. Darien would most likely be pissed that Jake was continuing to leave him out of the loop.</p><p>Sure enough, Jake wasn\u2019t more than five minutes down the road when his cell phone\u2019s familiar jingle alerted him. He yanked the phone off his belt and said, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Darien said hotly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in trouble. The woman I keep dreaming about. She\u2019s not pregnant. Or at least she sure as hell doesn\u2019t look that way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen why would she say...\u201d Darien didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, then he grunted. \u201cYou said she\u2019s not a gray wolf. Are you certain?\u201d</p><p>For a split second, Jake mulled that over. Then he frowned. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m certain. I was with her in Breckenridge that first day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she was bitten after you saw her?\u201d</p> <p>Jake considered that scenario, his hackles instantly rising. \u201cHell. If she\u2019s been bitten recently, she most likely has very little control over the shift.\u201d But that would explain why he was dream mating with her. She needed him desperately.</p><p>\u201cShe could have shifted at the gallery and didn\u2019t know what else to do about being stuck in the ladies\u2019 room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense.\u201d Jake let out his breath. It changed everything between them. \u201cThen who turned her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone who\u2019s after her possibly, or someone who\u2019s dead. That may be the reason she\u2019s never tried to hook up with you. Without knowing you\u2019re also a wolf, she wouldn\u2019t want to risk discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. Alicia has to be frantic.\u201d He only hoped to hell she was still alive so he could rescue her once again. And then they\u2019d deal with all the issues she had to face\u2014these men, a possible pack, her werewolf genetics, her need for a mate\u2014him.</p> <p>Silence met Jake\u2019s ears, then Darien finally said, \u201cAll right. Well, Peter said she\u2019s in a hell of a lot of trouble. You can\u2019t go it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to track her down, locate her scent, see what I can come up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But I\u2019m sending Peter and Tom for backup. And next time you have the urge to rescue some damsel in distress, let me know first, will you?\u201d Darien hung up on Jake.</p><p>Jake let out his breath in an exasperated huff. Yes, they worked together as a pack. And Jake was obligated to let his pack leader know what he was up to when there was trouble in the wind.</p><p>But that was under normal circumstances. This was way beyond normal. And he wasn\u2019t about to wait for everyone to get a move on when he was well on his way to locating his dream mate, with or without his pack\u2019s help.</p><p>Jake was doing this his way.</p> <p>Chapter 11</p><p>As a gray wolf, Alicia bolted out of the hotel and ran at a gallop, tearing through the woods and keeping close to the road that would take her to Silver Town. At this point, she figured she had nowhere else to turn. Although in the back of her mind, she kept telling herself she shouldn\u2019t try to locate Jake. That seeing him again would cause more problems than she was willing to face. He\u2019d want to see more of her, to protect her. And she knew she\u2019d end up having to bite him. Turn him. Just like Ferdinand had done to her. So that Ferdinand\u2014in his own words\u2014wouldn\u2019t be alone. If she turned Jake, she wouldn\u2019t be alone.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t do that to Jake.</p><p>So why was she still running toward Silver Town? Because for the first time in her life, she really didn\u2019t know what else to do. And she realized then just how isolated she\u2019d become. No real friends, not after her mother had been murdered by the Mob, and no family left.</p><p>Running through the pines and spruce and ash trees, she just hoped no one would shoot her.</p><p>She\u2019d have given anything to see those bastards\u2019 faces after she\u2019d bitten the one in the arm who\u2019d swung around to shoot her, once he\u2019d broken into the room and seen his buddy sitting dead against the wall. His jaw had sagged, his eyes had widened, and he\u2019d lowered his gun in surprise. She\u2019d lunged at him as if it was instinctual and bitten as hard as she could, afraid anything less wouldn\u2019t have gotten the message across.</p><p>And the other big, burly, black-haired man had squeaked like a girl when she\u2019d swung her head to bite him. Danny Massaro. The guy she was supposed to serve a warrant on. Ferdinand\u2019s brother, whom Ferdinand said would kill Alicia and him if Danny had the opportunity. She recognized his cologne. He\u2019d been at Ferdinand\u2019s condo and had come looking for her when she had hidden under the bed. He was partly responsible for Ferdinand\u2019s death. Maybe even the one who had ultimately killed him or given the order.</p><p>Danny had fired off three shots at the night sky as he fell on his butt, trying to avoid the snap of her jaws and her wicked teeth.</p> <p>For a damned instant, she\u2019d wanted to arrest him! As if he\u2019d have given her time to shift, dress, grab the arrest warrant and gun, and rearrest him. But then she\u2019d regained her senses, and too concerned he might aim the gun at her the next time, she hadn\u2019t stayed around to find out if he was aiming at her for sure.</p><p>She thought she might have bitten the other guy a little too hard, though. She wasn\u2019t certain, but he\u2019d lost the gun, which was her whole reason for biting him, and her jaws were so powerful that she hadn\u2019t realized her own strength. It felt as though she\u2019d crushed the bones. He had cried out in the most guttural pain, then dropped to his knees and collapsed on his face. He couldn\u2019t have died, unless she\u2019d given him a heart attack. Right now, she didn\u2019t care. She was alive and wanted to stay that way. And the truth of the matter was, if he had died, that meant one less killer on Mario\u2019s payroll who\u2019d be after her.</p><p>She\u2019d run across the street and headed for the woods, only looking back to see Danny still sitting on his butt, staring after her as if he had seen a ghost. Then he scrambled to his feet and ran into the room, ignoring his partner in crime. She was fairly sure he was looking to take care of her\u2014as Alicia the woman, and not in a pleasant way\u2014not realizing Alicia was the wolf that had just escaped them.</p><p>Her werewolf condition was wrought with mixed blessings. She didn\u2019t like the lack of control she had with shifting. Especially when she couldn\u2019t always shift at will or fight the shift during the full moon. But this biting business could come in handy. At least she was a lot more frightening as a wolf than she\u2019d been as a woman with a gun. And to an extent, she liked her enhanced hearing, although trying to focus on one conversation at a time had proved difficult sometimes. The sense of smell was something else. She smelled way too many odors that she didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>For the first time as a wolf, she\u2019d run good and long and hard, and she wasn\u2019t even tired. As a human, she couldn\u2019t have run half as fast or long without having gotten stitches in her side and leg cramps. She would have been doubled over, trying to catch her breath. In that sense, she loved the freedom that being a wolf gave her. Until she saw a pickup truck on the road beside the woods headed toward her.</p><p>Before she could dodge deeper into the forest, the truck applied its brakes and screamed to a halt. She nearly had heart failure and dove deeper into the woods.</p><p>A man hurried out of the truck yelling, \u201cAlicia Greiston! Wait!\u201d</p><p>She stumbled in surprise to hear the man calling her name, and the odd familiarity in his voice made her pause for a second.</p><p>The door slammed and the sound of crashing through the underbrush forced another healthy shot of adrenaline surging through her veins, and she bolted again.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think he could chase her down. And how the hell did he know her name? That she was the woman who was now a wolf? Had Ferdinand told someone that he\u2019d turned her before he died?</p><p>That was the only reasonable explanation she could come up with. But even so, how would he know she was in these woods?</p><p>\u201cAlicia! It\u2019s me!\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s voice sounded like Jake Silver\u2019s. The truck, now that she thought about it further, did look like Jake\u2019s. But it couldn\u2019t be him. That had to be wishful thinking on her part. Wishing he\u2019d come to her rescue. A wolf\u2019s rescue, rather.</p><p>Whoever it was would never catch up to her. Then just as abruptly, she didn\u2019t hear the sound of his crashing through the underbrush any longer, and she slowed to a trot. She didn\u2019t want to get too far away from the road and lose her way.</p><p>But then she heard something else. Something quieter approaching her at a run. She whipped around and nearly had a heart attack. A big gray wolf was running toward her, and her heart skipped beats all over the place. She turned to run away, but he leaped and tackled her. Her heart stuttered.</p><p>With his heavier weight, she fell beneath him, and he pinned her down, his mouth at her throat, forcing her to hold still. He didn\u2019t hurt her, but she knew that those wicked teeth clamped around her throat could kill her instantly.</p><p>Oh, God, she\u2019d managed to save herself from a bunch of thugs only to be killed in the wild by a real wolf.</p><p>She whimpered, scared out of her wits, wanting to thrash at him with her teeth but afraid he\u2019d crush her throat. He was panting and so was she. His chest heaved, but hers even more so since she\u2019d been running for so long. Forever, it seemed, he just held her there, not letting her up, pinning her to the forest floor, in charge, in control. Wouldn\u2019t he be surprised if she just shifted into a woman? Yeah, and then he\u2019d kill her for sure.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be thinking of mating with her, could he?</p><p>Oh, God, what a horrible thought.</p><p>She struggled a little, testing him to see his reaction. He squeezed tighter on her throat, still not hurting, but showing her he was in charge.</p><p>She might not have grown up around wolves, but she got the distinct impression his actions meant hold still, don\u2019t move, or else. She held still. She was a quick learner.</p><p>She closed her eyes, tired from running and being up late with her dream lover and fighting the bad guys. The wolf relaxed his grip on her throat, but as soon as she moved just a hair, he clamped down again\u2014not injuring her, just keeping her where he wanted her. She\u2019d already gotten the point, but they couldn\u2019t stay like this forever. What did he want with her?</p><p>The roar of an engine, braking of a vehicle, and slamming of two doors up at the road forced a fresh wave of panic to swallow her whole. She struggled to get up; the wolf forced her to lie still. He couldn\u2019t be crazy enough to want to keep her here. What if those who were coming were Mario\u2019s men? More than that, no wolf in its right mind would want to remain here when humans were approaching.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d a man called out. His voice sounded eerily like the first man who had yelled after her, calling her by name. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But what had happened to that man? The wolf couldn\u2019t have torn into him. She swallowed convulsively.</p><p>Then she reconsidered. The only one she knew by the name of Jake was Jake Silver. And the voice. The voice sounded like his. Yet he couldn\u2019t have known she was out here. And if he\u2019d had any inkling that she was, why had he stopped his truck by the roadside and chased after her\u2014a wolf\u2014calling her by name?</p><p>No way in hell could he know she was the wolf. Unless... unless Ferdinand Massaro had told him. A cold chill ran through her. She shuddered.</p> <p>What if Jake was in on this with Ferdinand? What if Jake also had a vendetta against Mario? And that\u2019s why Jake had come after her at the restaurant once he\u2019d spied her, then made friends with her in Breckenridge, trying to keep her safe. Maybe it all had been a ploy. Keep Alicia safe from Mario\u2019s men so that he and Ferdinand and whoever else was in their little gang could use her to do their bidding. Maybe Jake knew Ferdinand wanted Alicia for his own. Maybe Jake had also wanted her.</p><p>Because he was a werewolf, too.</p><p>She swallowed hard, her throat as parched as a dry Colorado summer. She couldn\u2019t believe any more werewolves existed. How could she have been so naive about Jake? Thinking that he\u2019d really cherished her like the way he\u2019d behaved? She should have known the way he\u2019d acted toward her wasn\u2019t genuine. No one had ever treated her the way he had, as though he had really cared. The notion would have upset her more if she\u2019d had time to reflect and wasn\u2019t so desperate to get away.</p><p>As soon as she could, she had to escape the whole lot of them and disappear for good. How in the world could her life have turned so inside out?</p><p>She twitched her ears, listening to the approaching men as they ran through the woods. What if the two men headed into the forest toward Alicia and this wolf holding her hostage were all werewolves, too?</p> <p>A shiver stole up her spine.</p><p>As the two people grew closer, she again instinctively struggled to free herself. And the wolf again forced her to stay still. If he\u2019d been a normal wild wolf, he would have run off to protect himself. Even if he\u2019d been someone\u2019s pet, she didn\u2019t think he could be trained to pin down another wolf until his \u201cmaster\u201d arrived.</p><p>The only saving grace? They didn\u2019t seem to want to kill her. But she was still one of the good guys, and being the lover of anyone who would call Ferdinand Massaro friend wasn\u2019t in the plans.</p><p>\u201cJake?\u201d the man called out again and sounded worried.</p><p>The other person running with the one who was speaking remained quiet.</p><p>And then they drew close. Really close, their feet tromping through the underbrush only a few feet away. Then she saw them.</p> <p>Alicia\u2019s mouth gaped as she stared at the one man, who looked a hell of a lot like Jake Silver. His brother. Had to be.</p><p>This man was tall and broad shouldered with brown hair a little lighter than the man who had stolen her heart. This one had a more jovial expression, and his eyes were lighter. He looked so much like Jake that the similarities were uncanny, though.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jake, is this Alicia Greiston?\u201d the man asked, crouching near her head, his gaze focusing on hers, but she thought he was addressing the male wolf pinning her down.</p><p>As much as she couldn\u2019t believe it, the wolf had to be Jake Silver, her dream lover.</p><p>She took a deep breath and smelled the new man. A wolf. A sexy, virile wolf. She couldn\u2019t believe he was one, too.</p><p>The other man joined him, his hair nearly black and his eyes just as dark. But what impressed her most was the police uniform he was wearing. And for the first time since her nightmare with the Mafia guys, she relaxed. But then she recalled Mario had a fair number of cops in his pocket. And a judge or two.</p><p>She stiffened.</p><p>\u201cIs it her, Tom?\u201d the police officer asked.</p> <p>\u201cIf the way Jake\u2019s holding her still is any indication, it sure looks to be,\u201d Tom said. \u201cWhat do you want me to do with her, Jake?\u201d He dropped a bundle of clothes down next to the wolf that was pinning her down.</p><p>Without a doubt, Jake was the wolf, which meant he had to be a werewolf. Newly turned like her? Had Ferdinand turned him, too?</p><p>No, no, Ferdinand had said he was all alone. That he didn\u2019t want to be alone. She was sure that\u2019s why he had turned her.</p><p>She stared at Jake in disbelief. She\u2019d never get used to any of this. How many were there really?</p><p>Jake slowly released her, but she didn\u2019t move. His eyes told her to stay still. Dark concerned eyes. He sat up, but he was still way too close. She was certain that if she tried to bolt, he\u2019d pin her right back down.</p><p>Tom put his hands on his hips. \u201cTwo of the men who went after her got away. They could be looking for her now. Should we take her home with us?\u201d</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t seen Jake since she\u2019d been turned. He couldn\u2019t have known unless Ferdinand had told him. None of it made any sense. Maybe Ferdinand hadn\u2019t been making any sense to her that night.</p><p>And maybe all of these men were in with Ferdinand Massaro. Or maybe only Jake. The others might be clueless about what Jake had been doing in Breckenridge.</p><p>The wolf stood and kept a wary eye on her. She finally moved to a sitting position, figuring she didn\u2019t have much choice about where she was going. Surely, these men meant to protect her for now, which had to be a good thing. Until she could shift, grab some clothes, and run.</p><p>Tom motioned back to the road. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you with us. Don\u2019t run, Alicia. Jake will chase you down if you try, and we\u2019ll have to resort to other measures. We\u2019ll give you protection at our home. You won\u2019t get a better offer.\u201d</p><p>Offer. The kind that no one could refuse. Jake had no intention of letting her go. Just like Ferdinand, if he hadn\u2019t been murdered, had planned to keep her for his own.</p><p>She would probably shift again before long, and then without clothes to wear, what was she to do?</p><p>She stood, more shakily than she wanted to let on, then trotted back toward the road. Jake kept pace beside her, brushing her shoulder and hip with his as if to remind her he wasn\u2019t going to permit her to deviate from her path. But his touching her was also a reminder of the intimacy they\u2019d shared and which seemed odd now that they were both wolves. She wouldn\u2019t have thought she could feel that way about him in this form. Yet, the deep feelings of longing for him stirred in her blood just like they always did when he was with her, either for real or in her dream state.</p><p>She didn\u2019t try to move away from him, too aware of the way his heated body felt touching hers, making her desire him something fierce. She craved that closeness and wanted to renew their friendship, to make love to him in the flesh again and rekindle the bond that came of the sexual contact. And that made her hate herself for allowing herself to be taken in by his dark seductive ways. For wanting a wolf. But he wasn\u2019t just a wolf. He was Jake. The man of her dreams. The man who had swept her off her feet the minute she\u2019d laid eyes on him in Breckenridge that first day.</p><p>She glanced at him and couldn\u2019t help but admire the beautiful way his dark brown fur masked the hairs between his eyes and ears, the fur dark red down his nose, and the same dark red coloring the curve of his ears, while he had beige fur underneath his chin and on his throat and chest. Dark brown fur covered his back like a saddle. He looked\u2014distinguished, intelligent, his darkened brown eyes looking back at her, watching her expression as if he was trying to read what she thought of him. And in an instant, she remembered him from before. Remembered the way the wolf had growled at the two men who had accosted her on the trail where she\u2019d left the wreath for her mother. This wolf. Jake.</p><p>She barely breathed as she thought about it further. About how the wolf had run off, then Jake appeared shortly afterward on the path. It had been Jake, coming to her protection.</p><p>That again tied him in with Ferdinand Massaro, didn\u2019t it? He was a werewolf like Ferdinand, so they had to have a connection. That he and Ferdinand both were gunning for Mario. But when the men had come after her, definitely Mario\u2019s men, Jake had once again stepped in to ensure her safety. She didn\u2019t want to think of Jake like that. She didn\u2019t want to believe he\u2019d just been using her.</p><p>Breaking into her dark thoughts, Jake nuzzled her face, and the feeling was akin to the caress of a soft cheek against a soft cheek, only in this case, fur against fur. But her whiskers were extremely sensitive and his touching hers was pure delight, no matter how much she attempted to rally against the feelings he stirred in her.</p><p>He licked her face, then continued to run beside her, sticking close, touching, endearing, reassuring. Like when he\u2019d held her cold hand in the restaurant, letting her know he was there for her when the menacing thug was ordering her from the place, Jake was here for her now. But it seemed unreal to feel these things for him as a wolf when he was also one.</p><p>Maybe he did truly care for her, but the fact he had been with Ferdinand ruined any chance she and Jake would have ever had.</p><p>\u201cPeter can drive if you don\u2019t want to shift back,\u201d Tom said to Jake. \u201cOr I can. I\u2019ll let Darien know we\u2019re headed back to Silver Town.\u201d He pulled a cell phone off his belt and flipped it open, then punched a button. \u201cHey, Darien, we\u2019ve found Alicia Greiston. The little lady\u2019s a pretty gray wolf. We\u2019re headed back to town now.\u201d He paused and looked at Jake. \u201cYeah, Jake\u2019s a wolf right now, too. All right. See you in about an hour,\u201d Tom said into his cell phone, then snapped it shut and shoved it back in its pouch.</p><p>Peter pulled the door open to his Suburban, and Tom tossed Jake\u2019s clothes in the backseat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive Jake and Alicia. You can drive Jake\u2019s truck back to the house,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Peter loped ahead to Jake\u2019s truck.</p><p>\u201cToo bad I didn\u2019t know you were one of us, or I could have brought a change of clothes for you,\u201d Tom said to Alicia. \u201cWait!\u201d he called out to Peter. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you drop by the motel in Crestview and see if you can get Alicia\u2019s suitcases released to you?\u201d</p><p>The police officer shook his head. \u201cThey\u2019ll confiscate everything at the crime scene. The sheriff will need to get Alicia\u2019s statement also, once she shifts back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Great. In a way, she\u2019d thought she was off the hook with the police. How in the world was she to explain what had happened at the motel? One minute she was human and the next a wolf?</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tom agreed, then let Alicia into the backseat of the vehicle. \u201cI\u2019m Tom Silver. The big gray wolf behind you is Jake, my older brother by five minutes. And from what Darien said, the two of you are already well acquainted. Darien is our eldest brother and our pack leader and runs Silver Town. Jake and I are sub-leaders, and Peter Jorgenson is the sheriff for the town.\u201d Tom gave her a broad smile, his eyes sparkling with humor. \u201cWelcome to the pack.\u201d</p><p>Jake sat next to Alicia in the backseat of Peter\u2019s vehicle, his feelings raw and mixed. He was relieved as hell she was safe and in his custody. And he was glad to know the woman he\u2019d been sharing nocturnal pleasures with was a gray lupus garou and that if his family history was correct, she was meant to be his mate.</p> <p>But this business about the thugs she\u2019d gotten involved with could be a real problem. And the fact she had to be newly turned was also a dilemma. Who had turned her, and where was he now? Had he mated with her, and if so, was he still alive? Because if he was, Jake could not claim her for his own. That made him wonder if the wolf who had turned her had taught her what she needed to know as one of their kind.</p><p>And had the wolf turned her against her will?</p><p>He was certain that if he hadn\u2019t pinned her down and kept her that way, she would have run off. Until she realized who he was. But she was newly turned, and he was sure the whole werewolf business was too unreal for her to swallow yet. She was probably just as stunned to learn he was a werewolf, as were his brother and Peter.</p><p>At least for now, she seemed resigned to her fate. He had half a notion of shifting to reassure her that it was truly him. To speak with her. To learn all he could about her.</p><p>She sat staring out the window, avoiding looking at him, he thought. Or maybe she just wanted to see where they were going. But he assumed she was upset.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t quit watching her, the way she sat so rigidly, so tense, her ears twitching back and forth, as she took deep breaths to sample the air. She was smelling the smells, memorizing them, cataloging them. Just as he had memorized her fragrance as a wolf. He would know her scent anywhere now and even the paw-pad trail she\u2019d left behind as they\u2019d made their way to the vehicle. If she ever ran as a wolf, he\u2019d find her without any difficulty.</p><p>Tom said to Alicia, \u201cEither Lelandi can loan you some of her clothes, or one of the other women can.\u201d</p><p>Hell, Jake wanted to talk to her, and he couldn\u2019t do it as a wolf. He shifted, and as soon as he did, she whipped her head around, eyes large and brown and endearing. He gave her a dark smile and pulled on his jeans.</p><p>She glanced at Tom. Jake frowned. She hadn\u2019t thought her dream lover had been Tom, had she? They did look a hell of a lot alike, except Jake\u2019s face had rougher angles, and his hair and eyes were darker.</p><p>She looked back at Jake, her gaze taking all of him in, and she swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cTom, when we get to town, stop at the lingerie store.\u201d Jake smiled at Alicia. He had every intention of taking care of her every need.</p> <p>\u201cSilk and Lace Delights?\u201d Tom\u2019s voice sounded surprised. \u201cShe won\u2019t be open this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call ahead. And we can drop by the all-night discount store after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know her size? As a wolf, she appears taller than Lelandi. But she\u2019s not as big as some of our female wolves. Maybe Silva\u2019s height?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>From what he\u2019d seen of Alicia, and that was every inch of her delectable body, he figured her to be Silva\u2019s height when Silva wasn\u2019t wearing high heels to make herself appear taller like the other grays while she waitressed at the Silver Town Tavern. Silva was just as buxom but taller than Lelandi, since Lelandi was a red wolf and Silva a gray. Yeah, he imagined Alicia and Silva were about the same build.</p><p>Jake thought about the logistics of the situation further. He wanted to get to know his soon-to-be mate unaccompanied. His grandfather\u2019s house would be the ideal setting. Isolated. Away from family so they could really be alone.</p><p>\u201cAfter we shop, you can drop us off at Granddad\u2019s old place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarien expects me to bring her back to his house,\u201d Tom said, again sounding surprised.</p><p>Jake didn\u2019t care for that scenario in the least. Everyone would get involved in his business with Alicia when he needed the time alone with her.</p> <p>\u201cWant me to call and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jake jerked on his shirt. Then he grabbed his cell phone from his pants pocket and called Darien. When his older brother answered, Jake said, \u201cWe\u2019re making a couple of clothing stops because Alicia has no clothes to change into. After that, we\u2019re staying out at the old homestead.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Jake knew Darien didn\u2019t approve.</p><p>Darien finally said quietly, \u201cShe\u2019s unmated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mated.\u201d He sure as hell hoped not anyway.</p><p>Tom looked up at the rearview mirror. At least Jake didn\u2019t think she could be, considering the way she\u2019d made love to him in the dreams.</p><p>\u201cNot pregnant either?\u201d Darien asked.</p><p>Jake glanced at Alicia. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not pregnant.\u201d At least he guessed she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBring her to the house,\u201d Darien said finally.</p><p>Not once had Jake ever gone against Darien\u2019s rulings. He might disagree and tell his brother what he felt in private or just with his immediate family present, but not once had Jake openly gone against Darien\u2019s decisions. This time he had to clamp down on his words before he spoke them.</p><p>Darien waited for Jake to acknowledge his order, knowing that with every second of delay Jake was showing how displeased he was.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dream mated,\u201d Jake finally said, reminding his brother that Alicia and he were meant to be together and nothing would stop that from happening.</p><p>Tom\u2019s gaze shot over the back of the front seat from Alicia to Jake, then to the road again.</p><p>Darien laughed over the phone. Alicia\u2019s ears perked up.</p><p>Hell, Jake didn\u2019t need this. He would have hung up on his older brother if Darien hadn\u2019t finally said, \u201cBring her home, Jake. We need to learn what\u2019s going on with her.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Jake came to his senses, somewhat. Thugs had tried to kill her. If they attempted to follow her here, the pack would need to know about it so they could deal with the threat effectively.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll welcome her to the pack right,\u201d Darien added.</p><p>The pack. She wouldn\u2019t just be Jake\u2019s mate but an important member of the pack. And Darien sounded serious. As if he believed Jake had found his mate. But why laugh about it initially? Because Jake had been so obstinate about not believing in such a thing.</p><p>He settled back against the seat. \u201cAll right. We\u2019ll come home.\u201d</p><p>But he was not resigned to making this a family affair.</p><p>Feeling a ton of emotions\u2014frazzled, relieved that she was safe for the moment, unsure of herself\u2014Alicia lay down on the seat, having heard Jake\u2019s brother tell him to bring her to his home. And Jake was fighting the order. But she could tell by the way Jake\u2019s body had lost some of its tension that he was giving in. Reluctantly, but nonetheless, he had capitulated. In a way, she wished she and Jake could have been alone. She\u2019d have a better chance at stealing away from them then.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t a clue about what would happen when she met the others in the pack, having never been around other werewolves. And she\u2019d never even considered that werewolves lived in packs. Loners, yes. Like Ferdinand and whoever bit him first. Or just some abnormal aberration\u2014a rabid wolf that had bitten a human and infected him, and no others existed.</p><p>But her thoughts kept straying to what Jake had looked like after he\u2019d shifted\u2014in the flesh, totally naked. No longer a dream, but the very hard, virile muscled man she\u2019d felt and stroked and loved when they\u2019d first been together. And then she reminded herself how he\u2019d known she was a werewolf\u2014Ferdinand had to have told him.</p><p>Then she wondered why Jake\u2019s brother asked if she was pregnant. Mary. At the gallery. Oh, God, poor Jake. Mary must have called him and told him Alicia had fainted at the gallery. And he thought...</p><p>She glanced back at him. He was watching her. Then he took a deep breath and ran his hand over her back in a loving caress. It felt good. He felt good. She wanted so badly to share their nighttime fantasies for real again. Damn her soul for falling for him.</p><p>She laid her head down on the seat and closed her eyes as he continued to stroke her back. The wickedly sexual part of her wanted to go with him to his grandfather\u2019s house and make wild passionate love to him.</p><p>But she considered what Jake and his brother had discussed. The mate issue didn\u2019t make any sense. Must be a werewolf term for sex with another of their kind. So why did he assume she hadn\u2019t been with anyone else? That she hadn\u2019t mated? If Ferdinand had lived long enough, she was certain he would have had sex with her\u2014against her will. But thankfully, he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Then she saw a sign announcing they\u2019d arrived in Silver Town, and she felt self-conscious. Up until now, she\u2019d been living on her own, putting up with this werewolf stuff the best she could in secret, until she\u2019d bitten one thug\u2019s arm and momentarily scared the other witless. But now to be around a whole pack of werewolves when she was so clueless made her feel vulnerable and anxious.</p><p>When Tom parked, she quickly sat up and stared at the store\u2019s large glass windows. A gold-and-pink-lettered sign perched on top proclaimed the store to be Silk and Lace Delights.</p><p>Her eyes widened. She\u2019d envisioned a plain, old shop full of the usual\u2014flannel nightgowns for winter, long satin nightgowns for summer, shorter versions, and pajamas. Instead, fiery red corsets, fringed hot-pink bras and thongs, fishnet camisoles and G-string panties, and an iridescent sequin-draped camisole were displayed on headless mannequins in the big windows.</p><p>Jake couldn\u2019t be serious. Not that she planned to wear other women\u2019s undergarments or that she wished to go without\u2014even though sometimes it seemed she might have to when she was in one of her panic-stricken states and needed to strip before she shifted\u2014but what was he thinking? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked at another mannequin and read the sign: peekaboo camisole. The slits in the bust fitted neatly over the nipples. Her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cStay here with her,\u201d Jake said, and when she swung her head around to look at him, he grinned at her. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p><p>No thongs, she wanted to tell him. No way was she wearing a piece of silk wedged between her legs. Or a camisole that left her nipples exposed.</p> <p>But then he was gone, and Tom turned to observe her with a look of wonderment on his face. The sheriff parked beside them and waited, watching Jake enter the lingerie shop, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.</p><p>Mortified was how she felt. If she wasn\u2019t wearing a coat of fur, she was sure she\u2019d be blushing furiously.</p><p>She just hoped Jake didn\u2019t get her what he thought she should wear to seduce him rather than what she would wear for comfort. But when he spoke to a clerk and lightly touched a royal blue corset pushing up the bust situated in the window, Alicia was ready to bolt out of the vehicle and tell him that if he bought it, he could wear it.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Normally, Jake wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead in a lingerie store. Certainly not that one. The women loved to get the corsets for the annual Victorian Era Day for some fun after the celebration, although without a mate, Jake hadn\u2019t thought he\u2019d ever get to partake in that part of the fun. The difficult part for the ladies seemed to be trying to pick just one. Lisa Grae, the thirty-year-old owner, was dressed in a conservative pale-blue dress. She raised her brows to see him come into the shop.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Jake. You didn\u2019t say why you had to come here tonight.\u201d She sounded more than surprised.</p><p>\u201cI need some things for a woman who\u2019s staying with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Can she visit and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut her size. Did she tell you what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the car in her wolf form and has no clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Lisa glanced out the window and frowned. \u201cOh. Is Sheriff Peter posing as a bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAll right. So you\u2019re not looking for anything fun. Just functional.\u201d</p><p>No, he wasn\u2019t looking just for functional. But he let Lisa lead him to the racks of bras anyway. He ran his fingers over the lacy cups, then the satin ones. He picked up red ones, one lace, one satin, the one without any padding, the other with padding beneath the breasts. He didn\u2019t know which Alicia would prefer so he would get both.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain that\u2019s her cup size?\u201d</p><p>He put his hand around the cup and nodded. \u201cAppears right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Lisa said, smiling, and the sound she made was one of speculation. Then she took him to a rack of panties. He selected three pairs of bikini panties in red.</p><p>\u201cMaybe a pair of white?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. Red suited her.</p><p>Then he looked back at the royal blue corset.</p><p>\u201cWhat about nightwear? A robe or something?\u201d</p><p>But now he couldn\u2019t tear his gaze away from the body hose that a couple of mannequins were wearing. One was a seductive fishnet, long-sleeved body stocking with an open crotch, and the other, a spaghetti-strapped sheer fishnet body stocking, also with an open crotch. Envisioning Alicia wearing any of it made him hard and wanting.</p><p>\u201cA robe?\u201d Lisa repeated, drawing his attention reluctantly from the body stockings.</p><p>He fingered a sheer, red-lace short robe.</p><p>Lisa smiled and folded her arms. \u201cDoes she wear a lot of red?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at Alicia watching him through the Suburban window and thought about it, but he didn\u2019t remember her wearing anything but white.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take this,\u201d he said, picking out a red shirt-like baby doll that reached just below the crotch, sheer enough to be revealing, but opaque enough to entice. He hastily paid for the garments, thanked Lisa, and headed for the door.</p><p>Alicia might not wear red normally, but he knew she\u2019d look hot in all of it.</p><p>With sack in hand, Jake returned to the vehicle. He smiled at Alicia as Tom drove them to the casual-clothes shop where Jake figured he\u2019d get her a pair of jeans and a T-shirt and sweatshirt. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back to town to shop once you\u2019re ready so you can pick up whatever else you might need until we can get your suitcases,\u201d he said, as she eyed the sack.</p><p>When she poked at his hand still grasping the sack, he reached in and pulled out the red lace bra. She looked up at him. \u201cRed would look good on you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tom glanced in the rearview mirror.</p><p>Jake pulled out a pair of panties. \u201cTo match the bra.\u201d He slid the robe out and put his hand underneath the fabric, smiling when he could see his skin through the sheer material. He could just imagine what she would look like in the robe. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. He couldn\u2019t tell if she was smiling or shaking her head in disbelief. But he didn\u2019t think she was unhappy with his selection. Tom pulled into the parking area of the casual-clothes shop, and Jake didn\u2019t take long to pick out two T-shirts, a sweatshirt, and a pair of jeans. He got her some flip-flops, too, not knowing her shoe size but guessing.</p><p>Then Tom drove them to Darien\u2019s home out in the country. Trying not to show how apprehensive he felt about her shifting when they got there and learning everything about her in front of his family, Jake caressed her back, which helped both of them to relax.</p><p>He just hoped the hell he\u2019d learn she wasn\u2019t already mated.</p><p>As soon as they arrived at Darien\u2019s home, Lelandi and Darien greeted Alicia as if she were a long-lost pack member. She remained glued to Jake\u2019s side, however, and he recognized that she was feeling anxious.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Lelandi coaxed, \u201cand I\u2019ll show you the guest room.\u201d She smiled brightly. Jake didn\u2019t think he\u2019d seen Lelandi this excited in weeks. She fairly glowed, and he was glad she was so thrilled to see Alicia. That would make it easier for her to fit into the pack. Although Alicia didn\u2019t seem any less anxious.</p><p>At least when they\u2019d had a newly turned wolf before, Carol had been from the town, had had psychic visions of what werewolves were beforehand, had been resigned to the fact she\u2019d be turned, and had had a pack to teach her the ways once she\u2019d been turned. Alicia didn\u2019t know anyone here and might not know a lot about being a wolf if a pack hadn\u2019t been watching over her. And he didn\u2019t think one had.</p><p>Alicia glanced up at Jake, and his heart went out to her. If he didn\u2019t think it would upset Lelandi, and if he didn\u2019t think Alicia might still feel unsure of herself as far as shifting into a naked woman in front of him, he would have insisted on going with her instead.</p><p>What the hell. He crouched in front of her and stroked her underneath the chin. \u201cAlicia, did you want me to go with you?\u201d</p><p>Her large brown eyes studied him for what seemed an eternity. Tom and Peter were standing behind them, waiting for her response. Darien and Lelandi were just as quiet. Alicia shook her head.</p><p>Jake smiled. \u201cAll right.\u201d Then he handed the two sacks of clothes to Lelandi and rubbed Alicia\u2019s head between her ears. \u201cGo with Lelandi then. I\u2019ll wait for you down here.\u201d</p><p>She nudged his thigh in an intimate agreement, then went with Lelandi. He knew Lelandi would be good for Alicia, no matter how apprehensive she might be feeling right now.</p><p>When she\u2019d disappeared up the stairs with Lelandi, Darien said to Jake, \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p><p>Tom looked halfway glad he wasn\u2019t needed for the lecture Jake was sure his brother planned to give him. When Jake and Darien entered his office, Darien took his seat on the couch, rather than behind the desk. It was a way of saying, This isn\u2019t pack business as much as it is family business.</p><p>Jake sat on a chair nearby and waited for what Darien had to say, already feeling defensive.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you don\u2019t know for sure if she\u2019s mated, do you, Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came to me in my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know if she\u2019s pregnant or not.\u201d</p><p>As much as he hated to admit he truly wasn\u2019t one hundred percent sure, Jake shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy are these men after her?\u201d</p><p>Jake leaned back in the chair and explained as much as he knew from the time he\u2019d met her to what Peter was sure to have passed along to Darien from the sheriff who oversaw Crestview.</p><p>Then women\u2019s laughter drifted to them all the way from the upstairs guest bedroom.</p><p>Darien raised his brows, questioning Jake as if he had a clue what the women thought was so funny.</p><p>\u201cOh, you poor thing,\u201d Lelandi said, holding her belly, tears in her eyes because she was laughing so hard as Alicia chuckled again in the guest room where she would be staying. Lelandi\u2019s red curls clashed with her red cheeks as Lelandi ran her finger over the \u201cbarely there\u201d crotch of one of the red thongs. \u201cI never liked wearing anything this skimpy. Jake must really have it bad for you.\u201d</p><p>Alicia smiled. \u201cI should buy him one and see how much he likes wearing it.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi laughed, her green eyes smiling. \u201cHe might just like one. You never know. As soon as it\u2019s feasible for you to go shopping, I\u2019ll take you. Lisa, who owns the lingerie shop, must have been shocked to pieces to see Jake buying for a wolf no one knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know what we are?\u201d Alicia asked, incredulous. She couldn\u2019t believe she was in a house full of wolves\u2014Darien, Jake, Lelandi, Tom, and Peter, but that there could be more in the town seemed surreal.</p><p>Somehow she had to ask Lelandi about Jake\u2019s ties to Ferdinand Massaro, though. She wondered if maybe he alone was tied in with them. That maybe the rest of Jake\u2019s family was clueless about his association with the criminals.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Of course.\u201d Lelandi reached out and squeezed Alicia\u2019s hand. \u201cWe run the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun the town? Jake said Darien did. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur pack does. As far as I know, it\u2019s pretty rare for a pack to run a whole town. Most packs just infiltrate towns, work at jobs among the humans, live among them, and have their getaway spots when they have to take a run on the wild side. But they don\u2019t decide who works in all the key positions. We only allow wolves to run the hospital, in case we have an emergency. And the vet clinic is werewolf run, too. So are the bank, the bed and breakfast, the florist shop, and most other businesses. But we\u2019ll explain all that later.\u201d Lelandi lifted the nearly sheer robe and raised her brows. \u201cThis barely covers anything lengthwise, and it\u2019s practically see-through. I\u2019ve got an extra robe if you need one. Do you like red?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alicia frowned at the push-up bra. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I would never have worn red lingerie, though, if Jake hadn\u2019t bought it for me.\u201d She pulled on the T-shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask you,\u201d Lelandi said, growing serious. \u201cAre you mated?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi seemed so concerned that Alicia paused at zipping up the jeans. \u201cI heard Jake talking about it to Darien. Does it mean my having had sex with a man?\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes widened marginally. \u201cOnly if he was a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not with a man, either, since I was turned.\u201d Except for her dreams with Jake, and she didn\u2019t figure that counted.</p><p>\u201cGood. And you\u2019re not pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. No. I\u2019m so sorry about that. I\u2019m afraid I got poor Jake into a lot of trouble over that. I didn\u2019t know what else to say when I shape-shifted so all of a sudden at the art gallery. No one saw me, but I had to give a reason for not answering them when it was closing time and I wouldn\u2019t leave the restroom stall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been horrible for you, Alicia. You\u2019re too newly turned to be out in public. I don\u2019t want you to worry about it. But the pack is your family, and we take care of our own.\u201d</p> <p>Alicia was so overcome that she gave a hug to Lelandi, who returned the gesture with heartfelt sincerity. Alicia had been so worried about how others would view her that she couldn\u2019t believe how welcoming they were. But she had to know if any of them were connected to Massaro and his cohorts. \u201cWhen are you due?\u201d Alicia asked.</p><p>\u201cA month. Triplets are on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTriplets? Oh, my. And...\u201d Alicia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cJake is a triplet?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled. \u201cHmm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The idea was finally sinking in that if she\u2019d ever had a child with Jake, it could very well be three at once. The worrisome thought suddenly struck her\u2014would they be werewolves, too?</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your family?\u201d Lelandi asked, quickly changing the subject, and Alicia wondered if Lelandi could read the worry in her expression.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any.\u201d Alicia thought Lelandi gave a slight sigh of relief. \u201cMy dad ran off when I was two, and my mother and grandmother raised me. But they\u2019re both dead now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear this,\u201d Lelandi said with genuine feeling. \u201cBut in a way it makes it easier because keeping your lupus garou genetics secret from them could be a trial.\u201d She shifted on the chair and rubbed her lower back. \u201cDarien said you are a bounty hunter. But until you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve got the shifting under control, you\u2019ll have to put your job on hold.\u201d</p><p>Alicia relaxed a little. \u201cI was rethinking whether I should stay in that job anyway after what had happened this last time. Although I often go after women so that we don\u2019t have cases of some woman screaming that there was sexual misconduct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething we can talk about later.\u201d Lelandi took a deep breath. \u201cWhere\u2019s the man who turned you?\u201d</p><p>Good. The opening Alicia needed. \u201cDead. And the man who turned him is dead also. Ferdinand Massaro was the name of the one who turned me.\u201d Lelandi showed no recognition of the name whatsoever. Alicia tried again. \u201cI thought you might know him since he was one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my goodness, no,\u201d Lelandi said thoughtfully. \u201cGiven our uniqueness, our secret is well guarded. Certainly we run into each other in communities beyond our own, but that\u2019s the only way we learn others exist.\u201d</p><p>Alicia sighed with relief. At least Lelandi didn\u2019t seem to know this man. \u201cBut Jake must have known him then.\u201d</p><p>A faint look of wariness appeared in Lelandi\u2019s eyes, but she quickly changed her expression and gave Alicia a faked smile. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Jake. Although I have to tell you that when we locate other werewolves in other locations, or when they stray into our own territory, we share that knowledge with our pack. It\u2019s instinctive. As co-pack leader with Darien, I would have been made aware of this discovery. In that light, I don\u2019t believe Jake knew the man who bit you.\u201d</p> <p>Alicia didn\u2019t know what to think. On the one hand, she got the distinct impression Lelandi was defending Jake\u2014that the coolness or hint of condemnation Alicia had tried to keep out of her voice when she mentioned Jake knowing Ferdinand had put Lelandi on the defensive. Alicia had to remember she was dealing with a family\u2014one that seemed cohesive and all supporting. And she was the outsider, no matter how happy they seemed to be that she was now among them.</p><p>\u201cThen if none of you knew Ferdinand Massaro, the knowledge he is dead is of no great importance to you,\u201d Alicia said coolly, watching for a reaction.</p><p>\u201cWe would only be concerned if he had done something to gather the attention of humans, revealing what he truly was either in life or death.\u201d Lelandi rubbed her belly and frowned at Alicia. \u201cWas he...\u201d She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWas he what?\u201d Alicia had the impression Lelandi was about to ask if the creep had been her lover. But how could Lelandi think that when she could see how much Jake wanted Alicia and how she felt about him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I meant to ask\u2014did he force himself on you? Did he turn you against your will?\u201d Lelandi\u2019s questions were spoken in a manner that showed concern mixed with controlled anger.</p><p>Her reaction took Alicia by surprise. She hadn\u2019t thought anyone would ask her the question, let alone be upset about it. Except maybe Jake. She suspected if he\u2019d known Ferdinand had planned to do this to her, he would have killed him. Yet wouldn\u2019t Jake have wanted to do the same thing to her? Turn her so they would live together as werewolves and have... werewolf kids?</p><p>\u201cAlicia?\u201d</p><p>Alicia looked up from her hands, not even realizing she\u2019d been wringing them. Tears filled her eyes as she recalled what had happened to her that night. Thinking about Ferdinand stripping her of her clothes. Fearing that he intended to rape her, torture her, and kill her. Recalling the bite on her arm and the men who had come to murder him and who had searched for her while she\u2019d hidden from them in abject terror. How she\u2019d turned into the wolf and felt she\u2019d become some alien being\u2014all alone to face her uncertainties.</p><p>Lelandi took her hand and squeezed. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You can talk to me about it later when you feel more like it. I\u2019m sure the men are waiting for us to return to them downstairs. There are tons of things we\u2019ll need to discuss with you so you\u2019ll understand what we\u2019re all about. But I don\u2019t want to overwhelm you.\u201d</p><p>Alicia sighed, having to get this off her chest. \u201cFerdinand declared I would be his, knocked me out, and when I came to, I\u2019d already been bitten. Men were with him in another room. They murdered him, and I must have passed out from the earlier blows to the head. Anyway, when I came to, I found I was a wolf. I couldn\u2019t shape-shift back for some time, but I left his place as soon as I was able.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you when they killed him?\u201d</p><p>More than idle curiosity was backing Lelandi\u2019s question, Alicia thought. Did she wonder if Alicia had watched the murder take place and then walked out of there on her own? That she was in on this whole mess? One of the bad guys?</p><p>\u201cI was half-groggy from being knocked unconscious the two times,\u201d Alicia said quietly. \u201cSomehow, I managed to pull my clothes off the bed and slide underneath it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were naked?\u201d Lelandi\u2019s brows were arched in surprise.</p><p>Alicia swallowed. \u201cYes. I... I assumed after what had happened, as far as I could piece together, I should say, that Ferdinand meant to bite me and...\u201d She shrugged, figuring Lelandi could fill in the blanks. \u201cI was terrified the men would find me. I still remember the odor of the cologne worn by the man who came to look in the bedroom. His method of searching for anyone in the condo reminded me of one of my...\u201d</p><p>Alicia had done it again. She hadn\u2019t meant to mention her ex-husbands. Her face feeling warm, she clenched her fingers together. \u201cMy ex-husband would look for something but if it wasn\u2019t lying out in plain sight, he\u2019d ask me to find it. He never thought to look under anything. In this case...\u201d She shuddered. \u201cIt was a good thing the murderer didn\u2019t look beneath the bed.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi let out a breath as if she\u2019d been holding it in. She\u2019d probably never lived half as dangerously as Alicia, not with a caring pack to watch over her. And the notion anyone would have wanted Lelandi dead would be alien to her.</p><p>\u201cThis Ferdinand Massaro just grabbed you off the street?\u201d Lelandi asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was my informant, although I\u2019d never met him before in person. But yes, he grabbed me when I was about to issue the warrant for his brother\u2019s arrest.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s eyes grew big. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you do. Ferdinand told me where to find his brother to make the arrest. Turning me was only part of his agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what about the men who came after you at the motel in Crestview?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were part of Mario Constantino\u2019s family. One of them, the only one who got away unscathed, was Danny Massaro. The man who shot and killed my mother. He also was Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s lips parted, then she closed them and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Alicia got the distinct impression that Lelandi and her pack wouldn\u2019t like having a troublemaker like Alicia in their midst. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bring any danger to your family,\u201d Alicia reasoned. \u201cMaybe Darien could help me return to my car in Crestview, and I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi didn\u2019t say anything right away, and Alicia thought she was considering her request favorably. Then she said, \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with us, dear Alicia. We won\u2019t let any harm come to you. As I\u2019ve said, because of our uniqueness, we must keep what we are a secret. Newly turned, you can\u2019t possibly get along on your own without a pack to...\u201d Lelandi hesitated. \u201cWe\u2019ll guide you. But I don\u2019t mean that in a controlling way. It\u2019s just that living among us, you\u2019ll learn how to cope with your abilities. Besides, Jake said the two of you are dream mated. And if you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, he\u2019s not about to let you get out of his sight again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what dream mating means,\u201d Alicia said, not about to get into a discussion of what Jake wanted or didn\u2019t want.</p><p>\u201cIt seems to run in the Silver genetics. We were all confused, though. It only happens between werewolves, and Jake swore you were strictly human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving... dreams of him didn\u2019t happen until after I was turned. And then it was if Jake was coming to comfort me after what had happened to me. As though it didn\u2019t matter about what I\u2019d become. Of course, I kept thinking that being a werewolf was like some kind of weird virus and that it would go away. But when we were together, at least in the dreams, I knew he didn\u2019t care what I was. Which in retrospect was crazy, because how would he have known I was a part-time wolf? In my dreams, though, I felt as though he knew because I did.\u201d</p> <p>Lelandi ran her hand over her arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how worried I was\u2014well, all of us were\u2014when Jake seemed so depressed. He kept retiring to his bedroom earlier and earlier, and we couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Alicia smiled at that. She knew the feeling.</p><p>\u201cAt first, he\u2019d been so reluctant to drop his pictures off at the art gallery in Breckenridge. Then he didn\u2019t come home until the next night. Darien and I figured he\u2019d met a woman and hung around a while longer. But when he was so disconsolate upon returning and said he was going back to Breckenridge, we didn\u2019t know what to think. Darien was sure Jake was planning on turning a human woman. Not something we do lightly.\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s jaw dropped in astonishment. \u201cYou weren\u2019t turned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born as a lupus garou. Same with most of our people. A few were turned a very long time ago. Every once in a while, the choice has to be made to turn someone who has seen what we are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr kill them?\u201d</p><p>Lelandi nodded. \u201cNot something we want to do, but sometimes it\u2019s our only choice.\u201d</p><p>Alicia swallowed hard. \u201cWhen the woman came to the restroom at the gallery and I had shifted, I was so afraid I\u2019d have to bite her. And then the others. And once the police were summoned, I knew I\u2019d be dead. They\u2019d figure I was a rabid wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you died,\u201d Lelandi said softly, squeezing Alicia\u2019s hand. \u201cThen you would have turned into a human. And, well, that would have taken some explaining.\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s mouth dropped open again. \u201cOhmigod.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s why until you get your shape-shifting abilities under control, you need to stay with only our kind.\u201d</p> <p>Then Alicia had another horrible thought. \u201cOne of the men who planned to kill me\u2014I bit him. What if I turned him?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Danny stood before Mario in his Breckenridge condo as Mario forked up another sausage link, trying to keep his temper under control. \u201cWhat I want to know is why you failed to bring the woman back with you and how two of my men died. Hell, it took seven weeks just to locate her.\u201d</p><p>Mario\u2019s voice was low and cold, and he was ready to kill Danny with his bare hands. He hadn\u2019t murdered anyone like that since he was in his teens. For years, he\u2019d had his henchmen doing his dirty work. Looked like he was going to have to get this job done himself, if he wanted it done right.</p><p>He still couldn\u2019t believe the woman had given up her chance to earn the bounty on him just to turn him in. He smiled evilly at the thought. Too bad she\u2019d had her information wrong and the police had arrived at his old residence only hours after he and Danny had split.</p><p>He shoved his clean plate aside, grabbed his pen, and pulled the newspaper crossword puzzle closer.</p><p>Ten across, nine letters: Extremely unpleasant experience.</p><p>Danny looked peeved, not at all like a man whose head would be on the chopping block next. \u201cI told you, boss. She shot Smithie and escaped. A vicious dog was in the room, and when me and Cicero tried to storm the place, the dog attacked. I got Cicero to the car and he died. I didn\u2019t know he had a heart condition. But that\u2019s what Doc said. The damned dog crushed Cicero\u2019s arm, and it triggered the heart attack.\u201d</p> <p>Mario wrote in the word purgatory on the crossword. \u201cDescribe this dog to me again.\u201d He lifted his eyes from the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cIt looked like a German shepherd. The same kind of head. But... not exactly the same kind of colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould it have been a wolf?\u201d</p><p>Danny stared at Mario as if he was crazy.</p><p>\u201cCould it have been?\u201d Mario demanded.</p><p>\u201cI guess so. I never seen a wolf up close.\u201d Danny\u2019s face looked drained of all color, the notion that a wolf might have gotten the best of him probably crossing his mind. \u201cYeah, it could\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>Mario looked back at his puzzle. Two down, six letters: Vibration.</p><p>\u201cWhen you killed your brother, there wasn\u2019t any sign of a dog in his place, was there?\u201d</p><p>Thoughtful-like, Danny\u2019s eyes stared at the floor. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t see any water dishes, dog-food dishes, nothing.\u201d</p><p>Mario shook his head. \u201cJust a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Ferdinand was alone. He wouldn\u2019t have had a dog. He didn\u2019t like kids or animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you killed Jimmy, he said Ferdinand had grabbed a woman. That she\u2019d been following me. Jimmy didn\u2019t know her name, but it had to be Alicia Greiston. So where was she when you located Ferdinand at his place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear I looked through the place. She wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>Mario just bet she had been. Damn, if only the henchman he\u2019d sent to murder Ferdinand in the first place hadn\u2019t gotten himself killed instead. And he wondered now if the man had bitten Ferdinand somehow in the process and turned him.</p><p>Mario pondered that as he stared at the crossword puzzle, not really seeing it. If the idiot had attacked Ferdinand as a wolf, but Ferdinand had managed to kill the assassin instead, Ferdinand had to have turned into a werewolf later, too. No wonder he\u2019d been so good at tracking Mario.</p><p>Mario had turned some of his men himself, thinking they might become better assassins, but the experiment had proved fruitless. Three turned gunmen on his payroll were now dead; all three had had problems with shape-shifting at the most inconvenient times. He\u2019d considered changing his cousin, but Mario didn\u2019t think Danny could handle it any better than his other men had. He thought about Cicero, too. If the man had survived the heart attack, he probably would have been turned when the wolf bit him.</p><p>But if Mario\u2019s men had trailed Alicia to her hotel in Crestview and she\u2019d been alone, where had the \u201cdog\u201d come from? Mario allowed himself a small smile as the crossword puzzle came back into focus and he wrote tremor. Crossword puzzles were his daily regimen\u2014an attempt to keep Alzheimer\u2019s at bay, as working the puzzles was supposed to do, since the insidious curse had affected both his parents.</p><p>His thoughts shifted back to Alicia Greiston. He assumed she was a wolf now. Ferdinand must have shape-shifted, then bit her and turned her, wanting her for a mate. Maybe even realizing Mario wanted Alicia. Since Mario had murdered Ferdinand\u2019s girlfriend, Candy, turning Alicia would be a way of getting back at Mario.</p><p>With Ferdinand dead, Alicia was Mario\u2019s. He\u2019d been a wolf for five years, since one of his adversaries had bitten him. He\u2019d been angrier than hell at the time, but he\u2019d soon realized how beneficial his newfound traits were. Except for the need to have a mate. The gorgeous bubbleheads he\u2019d turned all had ended up being liabilities. Until he\u2019d had them eliminated.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do, boss?\u201d</p><p>Alicia had to be running as a wolf. Newly turned, she might not be able to control her shape-shifting ability. Until the new moon appeared. Then she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her wolf form. Danny wouldn\u2019t be able to locate her as well as Mario could. Not without wolf instincts. This was one job Mario had to take care of on his own. Although he\u2019d send his men out looking for her just the same. Didn\u2019t hurt to be sure. But in the end, he had to do this alone.</p><p>One thing was certain: he had no other competition in the area. The she-wolf would be his, especially after all the trouble she\u2019d caused him.</p><p>Jake had had a devil of a time forcing himself not to pace while Lelandi was still upstairs with Alicia. He wanted Alicia alone, but Darien insisted on speaking with her. As much as Jake hated to admit it, Darien was right. The pack leader always had to know what trouble his pack might be up against. Jake knew that, yet he was having a hard time letting go of his need to be with Alicia after their forced separation and her near-death experience.</p><p>When he heard two pairs of footfalls on the stairs, he turned to watch for the women.</p><p>Darien rose from his chair and Tom joined them from the kitchen. Sheriff Peter had solicited some of their men for outdoor guard duty so he had already left the house.</p><p>As soon as the two women appeared, Jake had eyes only for Alicia. Her eyes were dark and shadowed, her skin pale despite the red T-shirt reflecting off it. Her brown curls swept her shoulders, but his gaze quickly took in her clothes. The T-shirt fit her nicely, showing off her perky breasts, and the jeans fit snugly. She wasn\u2019t wearing the flip-flops, though. Her bare feet made her appear even sexier, like she was ready to shuck the rest of her clothes to be with him.</p><p>His gaze lifted to her face, and she gave him a tremulous smile. He crossed the room at a quickened pace, drew her into his arms, and when she tilted her face up to his, he kissed her.</p><p>Nothing gentle about it\u2014his need to see her safe and protected was warring with his craving to make her his own. He didn\u2019t care that his brothers or Lelandi were undoubtedly watching him unabashed. His kiss was just as greedy as Alicia\u2019s was, yet tender in the way they pressed and nuzzled and opened up to each other, exploring and loving all over again.</p><p>\u201cGuess we don\u2019t need a Gathering,\u201d Tom said, his tone amused.</p><p>Jake ignored him. No way in hell were they having a Gathering to give any other eligible bachelors in the pack the chance to court her. She had been Jake\u2019s the moment he\u2019d laid eyes on her, and she had shown her interest in him right back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He finally broke free from the kiss, saw the tears in her eyes, and gave her another heartfelt embrace.</p><p>In pack-leader mode, Darien said, \u201cI know it\u2019s late, but we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Jake slipped his hand around Alicia\u2019s with a firm possessive grip and led her to the love seat where they sat down together, thighs touching. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Jake wrapped his arm around Alicia and pulled her against him, wanting to feel her warmth and breathe in her heady fragrance, to enjoy the softness of her body against his, to know she was truly all right and wouldn\u2019t leave him again.</p> <p>He wanted to tell his brother to hurry up with the questions because Alicia would be his mate tonight, but he held his tongue. She needed to see the workings of a viable pack, and Jake butting heads with his brother wouldn\u2019t help her cope.</p><p>Darien took Lelandi\u2019s hand and sat with her on one of the couches while Tom sat on a wide-winged chair. Darien kept his hand on Lelandi\u2019s, resting it on her thigh. For the first time since Jake had lost Alicia, he felt comfortable seeing the intimacy Lelandi and his brother shared. But it was only because Alicia was with him again. He wondered how Tom felt being the odd man out, but his expression remained neutral.</p><p>\u201cSo what are we up against?\u201d Darien asked Alicia.</p><p>Alicia honestly didn\u2019t know what to think. After all the questions Darien had asked her, and all the questions she\u2019d asked of him, no one in Jake\u2019s pack, nor Jake himself, seemed to have known of Ferdinand Massaro or his brother, Danny, or Mario and his thugs.</p><p>Which meant? Jake truly had been interested in her for herself when he first caught sight of her in Breckenridge.</p> <p>Lelandi patted Darien\u2019s thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s very late, and I\u2019m exhausted. Let\u2019s go to bed. If you have any more questions, you can ask them tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Darien looked from her to Alicia, then to Jake. Alicia wasn\u2019t certain, but she thought some unspoken communication was going on between the two brothers. She and her mother had been capable of giving each other a look, a subtle raise of an eyebrow, or slight gestures to send each other some secretive message or another. She hadn\u2019t realized how much she\u2019d missed that special connection she\u2019d had with her mother until she saw the nonverbal communication pass between Darien and Jake. If she ventured a guess, Darien was warning his brother against her.</p><p>Darien had nothing to worry about there. She\u2019d already had two failed marriages. She wasn\u2019t about to embark on a third with Jake or anyone else, for that matter. So big brother didn\u2019t have to worry about her blemishing the family tree when they were all born lupus garous and her werewolf abilities had come about because she\u2019d been forcibly bitten.</p><p>Lelandi said, \u201cJake\u2019s always an early riser and makes a delightful breakfast.\u201d She suddenly flushed a brilliant red, quickly said good night, and hurried off with Darien, his arm wrapped around her waist. He chuckled low next to her ear and kissed her there.</p><p>Tom gave Alicia and Jake a nod, then headed up the stairs after them.</p><p>As soon as they were all out of sight, Alicia said, \u201cYour brother seemed concerned about me.\u201d</p> <p>But Jake didn\u2019t seem interested in any further conversation. He cupped the swell of her breast in an unassuming manner and captured her mouth with his in a totally assuming way. His tongue demanded entrance as his hand hovered near the tip of a breast that was already swelling and tingling in anticipation.</p><p>His eyes were closed as if he was memorizing the feel of her, the taste of her, the scent of her, just as she was of him. Her tongue flirted with his, and he took charge and dove deeper, the pad of his thumb barely touching the tip of her breast. When she moved into his mouth as his tongue caressed hers, the erotic sensation set off a firestorm in her belly. He groaned with need.</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d he said, sounding damned desperate.</p><p>She threaded her fingers through his hair, wanting him as she\u2019d never wanted any man before he\u2019d come into her life, but\u2014</p><p>She pulled her mouth from his, saw his eyes glazed with lust, and worried that she\u2019d shift in the middle of making love to him. She was burning up, just like when she\u2019d shift. His hands cupped her face, and he leaned down to kiss her again as he trapped her against the soft cushions of the sofa.</p><p>She put her hands on his chest and said, \u201cNo,\u201d against his mouth. \u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d Her voice was breathy and barely there.</p><p>His actions seemed to be on auto drive as he again tried to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said louder and kept her hands planted against his chest.</p> <p>She seemed to break through his lust-filled gaze as he looked down at her inquiringly. \u201cAlicia?\u201d His voice was thick with need.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His hands dropped from her face to her shoulders, and he rubbed them lightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother doesn\u2019t like it that I\u2019m newly turned and would become part of the family like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d He leaned down to kiss her, but she held him at bay again.</p><p>\u201cHe gave you a look,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Jake frowned at her, appearing puzzled.</p><p>She said in exasperation, \u201cHe gave you a frown, telling you to watch yourself with me.\u201d</p><p>A slow predatory smile curved Jake\u2019s mouth. \u201cHe wanted me to take it easy with you because you\u2019re newly turned. He doesn\u2019t know anything about our nighttime fantasies.\u201d He lightly pinched one of her nipples through the T-shirt and bra. \u201cWhich bra are you wearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I shift in the middle of making love?\u201d she asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d He drew her T-shirt partway up her tummy and slid his hand underneath the fabric, feeling first the underside of the lace bra, then higher to the swell of her breast, feeling her exposed breast, his touch making her blood heat and her skin tingle with an aroused sensation.</p><p>He smiled in a way that looked inherently smug and immeasurably pleased. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing the push-up bra.\u201d</p><p>Jake kissed Alicia then\u2014melting away the pent-up frustration of not finding her for so long, the unwavering need to know she was all right, that she was with him again. Holding her, touching her, overpowered any sense of renewing their acquaintance at a more leisurely pace. Hell, from the beginning, he hadn\u2019t been able to restrain that need to have her now and fully.</p><p>Her mouth was instantly pliant when his lips pressed gently against hers as he tried his utmost to coax a willing response instead of battering down the defenses she had initiated.</p><p>His tongue briefly licked hers, his fingers threading through her thick hair, cupping the back of her head, pressing her body against the couch. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed about you like this ever since you vanished from my life.\u201d He kissed her again, this time conquering and possessing, her lips and tongue drugging him.</p><p>She responded in such a way as to prove she craved his touch as much as he wanted hers. Her fingers clutched at his back, pulling him against her, and her insistent, frantic touch was just as needy.</p><p>Dragging his mouth away from hers with the utmost willpower, he huskily said, \u201cLet\u2019s take this upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll hear us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t.\u201d He took her hand and pulled her from the couch. \u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you for good until you came to me in the dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be with you so badly,\u201d she admitted, and Jake swept her up in his arms and carried her up the stairs to a bedroom of dark, rich burgundy.</p><p>He caught her astonished look at seeing the photographs of predominantly purple wildflowers on the walls.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He pulled away the bedcover. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t so late and I didn\u2019t think you were a bit tired, I\u2019d take you to the lake where we could do some skinny-dipping.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, the first true expression of happiness she\u2019d made since they\u2019d found each other again.</p><p>Fully clothed, he laid her down on the mattress, then pressed his body against hers onto the soft bedding. He fanned his fingers over her nipples in that delicious way that made them tighten with need.</p><p>He smelled so good, like the pines that they\u2019d run through as wolves, when he renewed his probing of her willing mouth with his insistent tongue. His arousal pressed hard against her parted legs, and she stirred against him, rubbing him, inviting him in.</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d he mouthed against her lips, his hand sliding up her T-shirt and pushing down the lace cups of the push-up bra. His hands swept over her breasts gently, almost reverently. Her fingers slid up his T-shirt and combed through the dark hair on his chest, more desperate than anything as she felt the muscles flex beneath her fingertips. His warm breath tickled her breasts, caressing the flesh, his hot tongue teasing a highly aroused nipple. He rubbed his erection against her thigh as if showing her just how turned on she\u2019d made him.</p><p>Fire consumed her as she tugged at his shirt to get it off. And when he yanked it over his head, he was again kissing her throat, his hand pressed gently down her belly, slipping under the waistband of her jeans and lower until he was stroking her through the red satin panties.</p><p>She writhed under his fingers\u2019 skillful touch, tugged at his belt, which he quickly jerked free, then pulled her hand across his rigid length and pressed hard. She caressed him through the soft jeans, and he quickly yanked off her T-shirt as if he\u2019d lost any restraint he\u2019d managed to have until now. Until he saw the red lace push-up bra beneath her breasts, now reddened from his lightly abrasive two-day growth of beard and all the kissing he\u2019d been giving them. He unfastened her jeans and pulled them off. Then he removed his own jeans in haste.</p><p>She tsked as she saw his nakedness.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI was in a hurry to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nearly died when you came for me as a wolf,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way I could catch you.\u201d</p><p>But then he feasted his eyes on the red bra and the red silk panties, groaned in needy approval, and slipped her panties off.</p><p>She felt irresistibly beautiful to him, loved and desired, just as much as she felt about him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His fingers found her wet and willing, and his strokes made her wild. The feel of his touch was so much more pleasurable than in the dreams, so much more real and exquisite, reminding her of their love bouts before she\u2019d left him. Without being able to cling to the moment, the climax crashed over her with ecstatic fervor, and she felt that elusive high she always had with him. Before she could cry out, his mouth was on hers, and he was pressing his erection inside her, thrusting, savagely claiming her as much as she was taking him in deeper, holding him, wanting him, claiming him back.</p><p>Her senses were revved, she realized with blissful shock. Because of the wolf in her, every sense she possessed was stronger, more alert, more attuned. The musky male scent of him, the sound of his heart beating rapidly, of his breath coming hard, the feel of the hairs on his chest and his chin brushing against her sensitive skin\u2014and she felt the earth-shattering climax hit her once again. She moaned with pure pleasure as he thrust one last time and sank against her, spent only for the moment. Because with Jake, once was never enough.</p><p>Late the next morning, Alicia woke to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and eggs and ham cooking in the kitchen. She looked up at Jake, whose arms and legs were wrapped around her, but she wasn\u2019t sure if he was being protective or purely possessive.</p> <p>She loved being with him like this, yet she felt an odd sense of disquiet. She thought it might be because she still worried about Mario and his men causing trouble for Jake and his people.</p><p>Jake smiled sleepily down at her and kissed the top of her head. \u201cI think they finally gave up on waiting for me to cook breakfast for them this morning. You were sleeping so soundly that I wouldn\u2019t have disturbed you for the world.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThey\u2019ll be annoyed with me then.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo. We all love to cook. I just tend to get up earlier than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hand between them and touched his rigid erection. \u201cI know,\u201d she said coyly.</p> <p>He grinned at her. \u201cWaking up to you has been my fondest desire.\u201d</p><p>She stroked his chest with her fingernail and looked up at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t dream last night about you. The first time in seven weeks. Did you dream about me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to.\u201d He kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate morning. Everyone will be heading to work\u2014should have been already\u2014all except Lelandi. She\u2019s working on a psychology degree through an online college program so she can study at home. Sheriff Peter and some other men are hanging around outside in the event Mario or his men learn you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to cause trouble for you and your family,\u201d she said with regret.</p> <p>He held her tighter. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have allowed any harm to come to you. You shouldn\u2019t have left your hotel like you did. I saw Mario\u2019s note to you in your hotel room, Alicia. I know you thought Mario would have me killed. But it couldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t know that,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t even have a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on me. I realize you were afraid for my life. I realize, too, how hard it had to have been for you to have left me. And I know you couldn\u2019t quit thinking of me.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and tweaked his nipple. \u201cYou think so, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know so.\u201d He gave her a smart-ass smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d he said, brushing his thumb softly against her cheek, \u201cyou\u2019ve been dream mating with me. And that\u2019s why you went to the art gallery to find out where I was living. Then when they were after you, that\u2019s why you headed toward Silver Town\u2014to find me.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and snuggled against his chest, her breasts feeling heavier than normal and the tingling renewed again. She\u2019d missed her period, thinking at first that it had to do with her werewolf changes. But with every passing day, she feared that might not be the reason at all.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t deal with this right now and tried to pull away from Jake. But he wouldn\u2019t let her go.</p><p>\u201cCan you get my bags from the police in Crestview today?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ll need to talk to you about what happened first, most likely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. But I need my bags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d take you shopping as soon as you can manage. When the new moon appears, you won\u2019t change at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t?\u201d She relaxed a little. Was that why she hadn\u2019t shifted for two of the weeks out of the past seven? There was hope for her to live a seminormal life yet.</p><p>He caressed her shoulder with his fingertips in a slow, lazy pattern. \u201cNo. Only royals, so called because they have so few human links in their past, can change at will during any phase of the moon. The rest of us can\u2019t. So it\u2019ll be a good time for you to enjoy seeing the area, circulate a bit, and get to meet the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why for about a week, on two different occasions, I thought the virus had passed. That I was cured.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows.</p><p>\u201cI guessed I wasn\u2019t cured of the condition when I shape-shifted at the art gallery. I\u2019m so sorry Mary thought you had gotten me pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will get you that way,\u201d he said, smiling, rubbing his hand over her belly. \u201cJust a little later than she would believe.\u201d</p><p>For a minute, Alicia barely breathed under Jake\u2019s skillful caresses. She took a deep steadying breath. \u201cI swore after my first two disastrous marriages that I\u2019d never get married again. That was before I ran into you, or I should say, you began to follow me. I kept bemoaning the fact that I\u2019d met you too late\u2014after I\u2019d gotten myself into this mess with the Mob\u2014and I was afraid they\u2019d kill you.\u201d</p><p>His fingers stilled on her belly, and he finally really looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening. Trust me in this. From the moment I met you, we were in this together.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThen I was a werewolf. And if I came to see you in Silver Town, even though that\u2019s exactly where I was headed because I had no other alternative, I knew I\u2019d bite you and turn you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cSo see, that proves you wanted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, in the worst way. But I couldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries there.\u201d</p><p>She looked anxious, but he couldn\u2019t figure out what was still bothering her. Before he could ask, she blurted out, \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a child out of wedlock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t have had a child before you were turned. Well, except in rare instances. Lelandi\u2019s brother, Leidolf, was telling us about a case he learned of on the Oregon coast. But it\u2019s so rare that there\u2019s nothing to be concerned about. If you conceived werewolf babies, they wouldn\u2019t be considered born out of wedlock anyway. Not once you\u2019re mated.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, then pulled free and sat up in bed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the rules for marriage are different for werewolves.\u201d</p><p>Jake frowned at her. Then he slowly rose to a sitting position. \u201cWe\u2019re dream mated, which means we were meant to be together. We consummated the relationship last night\u2014several times, I might add. We\u2019re mated, Alicia, for life. That\u2019s how werewolves do it. Just like our wolf counterparts do. We don\u2019t have a wedding per se. No divorces either. I thought you knew that.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and groaned, then opened them and tried to leave the bed, but he grabbed her wrist and pulled her close. \u201cI thought you understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I?\u201d She pulled her hand free, and this time he let her go. She grabbed her clothes and headed for Jake\u2019s bathroom and shut the door behind her.</p><p>Jake stared after her in disbelief. She was his. He was hers. Had to be, according to the dream-mating scenario. Hell. He would never have taken her without her first agreeing to the conditions. Although he would have worked damn hard early on at convincing her to agree. They were meant to be together, but he would have waited until she realized the truth.</p><p>He cursed himself for not better understanding her newness at being a werewolf. And vowed to make it up to her. But there was no taking back what they had done.</p><p>For life, that\u2019s how werewolves mated, just like their wolf cousins. He wanted to join her in the shower and convince her how right they were for each other. But the shower turned off, and he waited instead.</p><p>She finally emerged from the bathroom. He caught sight of her reddened eyes, and he felt his whole world deflate.</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d he said, moving to take her into his arms, \u201cwe\u2019re meant to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might be pregnant,\u201d she sobbed, her tear-streaked cheek planted against his bare chest, her fingers curled into fists at her side, her whole body language showing defeat. \u201cI should have let you know before we were... mated. Now from what you say your kind practices, you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d She gritted her teeth and looked at him with such a woeful expression, he quickly moved in close to her.</p><p>Being stuck with her forever was just how he wanted to be. He gathered her in his arms and tried to console her, but his thoughts were swirling as he tried to sort out the possibility of her being pregnant. \u201cI wanted you from the first time I saw you. This changes nothing between us. But you said you only think you\u2019re pregnant? You don\u2019t know for certain?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t know for certain, but... it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have made you pregnant,\u201d he said, glumly.</p><p>\u201cSo you already said.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what was eating at her. Only one person could have made her pregnant, he thought, if she was right in her assumption. The bastard who bit her.</p><p>\u201cFerdinand Massaro?\u201d He tried to keep his tone consoling, but if the bastard had made her pregnant, he had raped her.</p><p>She let out a ragged sigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d done anything to me. Except bitten me. But I\u2019ve been feeling... different. And my... period is... late. But I thought maybe it was all this stress with the werewolf shifting that was making me feel strange and had thrown me off my regular cycle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake hugged her tight. \u201cNo matter what happens, I love you, Alicia. If you\u2019re pregnant, the child will be ours.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled but wouldn\u2019t look at him. He tilted her chin up and looked into her red eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Do you hear me? I\u2019ll love our child as much as I love you. All right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but she didn\u2019t look like she believed him. He sighed and kissed her lips, then gently caressed her face with his thumbs to brush away the tears trailing down her cheeks. \u201cDo you want to get breakfast?</p> <p>She hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI can bring something up here to you.\u201d He hated to suggest it, feeling that she needed to be with the family, but he realized how difficult this might be for her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to say anything about this to anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cNot until I know for sure one way or another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the baby?\u201d he questioned. He wasn\u2019t hiding the fact they were mated.</p><p>Her lips parted, then she nodded.</p> <p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d But that didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t checking into Massaro\u2019s background. And deep down, Jake was disturbed about this whole matter. Not only about the fact she might be carrying Massaro\u2019s child, although he\u2019d love the child as his own, but because of the way Massaro would have gotten her with child. But also because she was reticent about being mated to Jake. He felt bad that he hadn\u2019t given her a choice about that. Although ultimately, there would have been only one choice to make.</p><p>\u201cYou might want to dress before we go downstairs.\u201d She gave his nude body an assessing look, then gave him a small smile.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSure you don\u2019t want to stay up here, and I\u2019ll make us a special breakfast after everyone\u2019s left for the day?\u201d He waggled his brows.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tempting,\u201d she said with a sigh.</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cYou\u2019re really not upset about our mating?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a watery smile. \u201cWhen all I\u2019ve wanted is to be with you, night after night? I could think of hardly anything else, and now I\u2019m with you for real.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re worrying about being pregnant then?\u201d</p><p>She gave a shallow nod.</p><p>He took her hand and kissed it. \u201cEverything will be all right, Alicia. You\u2019ve got me, and you have a whole pack to be your family now. You\u2019re not alone in this. You\u2019ll never be again. I\u2019ll grab a quick shower, and we can head downstairs. I\u2019ll show you my grandfather\u2019s home where we\u2019ll live once we resolve some other issues. We\u2019ll have lunch and an afternoon nap after that. How\u2019s that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to work?\u201d She sounded as though she was afraid he\u2019d leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cNot anytime soon. Darien won\u2019t need me for a few days, time enough for you to get acclimated to the pack and to our ways. Besides, until we know that Mario and his men aren\u2019t coming after you, I\u2019m staying with you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, a small smile appearing that cheered him, and gave a breathy little laugh. \u201cYou must have thought it was funny when I said I\u2019d protect us both because I had a gun.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and ran his hand through her thick curls, then held a handful with reverence. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018If you only knew.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p> <p>When Jake and Alicia finally went down to breakfast, Tom and Darien both looked up at them as Jake steeled his expression and guided Alicia into the dining room, the large picture window facing out onto the woods, Jake\u2019s photos of woodland flowers hanging on the walls, and the long oval table covered in golden sunflower place mats. Alicia\u2019s attention was riveted on his floral photographs, and he saw real admiration in her eyes. But his brothers exchanged looks, and Jake knew that despite trying to keep his expression neutral, he\u2019d conveyed strife in paradise.</p><p>Both observed Alicia, and he imagined they could tell she\u2019d been crying.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Darien said to Alicia, and Tom echoed his words, although Darien gave Jake a harsh look as if he\u2019d been to blame for Alicia\u2019s upset.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Alicia said quietly, avoiding looking at them, while Jake only nodded.</p><p>Lelandi came out of the kitchen appearing tired. Jake imagined that the babies kicking in her belly were keeping her awake, although her expression brightened when she saw Alicia. A flicker of concern fluttered across Lelandi\u2019s face when she noticed Alicia\u2019s red eyes, but she quickly smiled and motioned to the table\u2014where the yellow ceramic serving dishes were filled with eggs and ham, biscuits, and cantaloupe, watermelon, and honeydew melon.</p><p>\u201cHave your pick,\u201d Lelandi said cheerfully.</p><p>After Jake pulled out a chair for Alicia, she took her seat, and he sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dying to hear about your chosen profession as a bounty hunter,\u201d Lelandi said, her enthusiasm contagious as she took her seat next to Darien.</p><p>Jake thought Lelandi was the perfect person to help get Alicia\u2019s mind off her troubles. Maybe the psychology courses were part of Lelandi\u2019s need to analyze and try to help anyone in need, although he suspected those traits had more to do with her nurturing personality.</p><p>\u201cYou would not believe the kinds of cases I\u2019ve been involved in.\u201d Alicia forked some fruit onto her plate, and for the first time she seemed at ease.</p><p>\u201cCoffee? Tea?\u201d Jake asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, neither.\u201d</p><p>That surprised Jake because she\u2019d had tea when she\u2019d eaten breakfast before.</p><p>\u201cJuice? Milk?\u201d Lelandi asked.</p><p>\u201cMilk.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi returned to the kitchen and soon popped back into the dining room with a glass of milk. She handed it to Alicia, then sat across the table from her. \u201cOkay, tell us about this bounty-hunting business of yours. It sounds like it could be fascinating.\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s choice of beverages made Jake wonder if maybe there was something more to her being pregnant. He again glanced down at her waist, but she wasn\u2019t showing yet. Too soon, he suspected. He wondered how he could get her in to see Doc Weber. Surely Doc could tell whether she was or not. Especially since seven weeks had passed since Ferdinand Massaro had turned her.</p><p>Alicia held up a finger as she finished chewing a sausage link.</p><p>Jake\u2019s brothers had finished their breakfast, and it was past time for them to be on their way. Although as efficient as the pack was at running the town and the Silver businesses, they didn\u2019t need the pack leader and his sub-leaders micromanaging any of it. Still, Jake had hoped they\u2019d leave so he\u2019d have more alone time with Alicia.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t appear to be in any hurry to depart. He suspected that since Alicia was newly a member of the family, they wanted to know everything about her.</p><p>\u201cOnce,\u201d Alicia said, \u201cI was supposed to arrest a woman who\u2019d stolen a good deal of money from the department store where she clerked. She would give a refund to a customer, then pocket a refund herself. It was a one-for-you, one-for-me kind of affair. She was addicted to gambling and was a habitual lottery-ticket purchaser. But besides the obvious shortages in her register at the close of her shifts and the camera\u2019s catching her pocketing the money, she skipped her trial. I had the job of serving the warrant, but her family was hiding her. So I put out the word that she had won a lottery ticket.\u201d Alicia smiled. \u201cThat did it. I delivered the search warrant in place of the winner\u2019s fees and escorted her to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoes to show gambling doesn\u2019t pay,\u201d Lelandi said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Most of the cases I\u2019ve dealt with were petty criminal cases. One was a car thief who failed to see his parole officer and was ordered back to jail. I found him hiding underneath a mattress. Really brilliant since the one side of the mattress was elevated so high that any fool could have seen someone was wedged in between the mattress and the box springs even though he was fairly scrawny.</p><p>\u201cAnother time, I found a woman hiding underneath a flipped-over swimming pool in the backyard, while the dog stood wagging its tail at me right beside the plastic blue pool. Another time a guy hid in the attic. In his panic, he stepped through the ceiling. By the time I had him in plastic ties, he was a mess and covered in itchy insulation. I was lucky that I never had to arrest anyone really dangerous, though.\u201d</p><p>Jake raised his brows at her. Her gaze shifted to him, knowing he would have something to say about that.</p><p>Looking a little flushed, she buttered a biscuit. \u201cUntil now. The bondsman I work with liked to give me cases where he needed a woman rearrested, so that there could be no threat of someone screaming about sexual misconduct. Or cases where the perp was not a member of a gang or anything. One of the other bounty hunters I knew had gotten into a real bind trying to take down an individual who was a drug dealer and had ended up in a house full of methamphetamines, money, drugged-out wackos, and guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this time?\u201d Lelandi probed.</p><p>Jake bit his tongue to keep from saying anything about this time being personal. But he was having a damn hard time not voicing his opinion. He sighed. He and his brothers would have reacted the same way as Alicia did, truth be told. Even Lelandi had responded the same way concerning her own sister, which had gotten her into a world of danger. So he couldn\u2019t really blame Alicia. Although in their case, they were wolves and the thought of a female human going it alone didn\u2019t sit well with him.</p><p>\u201cThe man I worked for did me a favor. He let me go after Danny Massaro and Mario Constantino on my own,\u201d Alicia said.</p><p>Lelandi rubbed her lower back. Evidently the babies were giving her spine trouble again, which prompted Darien to move his chair closer to hers and to begin rubbing the area she was attempting to soothe. She smiled at him. \u201cThanks, honey.\u201d Then she frowned at Alicia. \u201cIt seems to me that these men are awfully dangerous sorts. I would think the man you worked for would have worried about your safety as well as your success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d Alicia wouldn\u2019t look at Jake, her head slightly bowed. Then she raised her chin in defiance. \u201cI had inside knowledge. My informant wouldn\u2019t deal with anyone else. So the bondsman had to let me do it if he wanted any assurances that the men would be taken into custody.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHell, the informant was that bastard Ferdinand Massaro. And he was the one who changed you,\u201d Jake growled. \u201cWhy did he have designs on you in the first place?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help the way he felt about it. Not only was he pissed off that the man had turned her, still hating himself for not having been there to protect her, but the possibility that the man had raped her rested heavily on Jake\u2019s mind. The vehemence in his voice had all eyes engaged on him. All except Alicia\u2019s. She was wringing her hands in her lap, staring at the table.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to settle his irritation, Jake swept a curl away from her cheek and pressed a kiss to her temple. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of them.\u201d His words were spoken quietly now but with dark resolution.</p> <p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have a bounty hunter\u2019s training. You can\u2019t turn them in without it,\u201d Alicia said, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re werewolves, Alicia,\u201d he said, taking her hand in his and caressing the palm with his thumb, \u201cthey can\u2019t go to jail.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were wide, filled with a fresh shimmer of tears. \u201cBut they can\u2019t be allowed to get away with murdering my mother. They can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>When she tried to pull her hand away from his, he held on even tighter, unwilling to let go of the tentative connection they had. He realized then she probably didn\u2019t even know about werewolves\u2019 longevity.</p><p>\u201cWe live long lives. Very long lives. If you\u2019ve read any werewolf lore, you probably know it\u2019s not easy to kill us. But what you might not know is one of the reasons werewolf legends have persisted from ancient times is that we live so many years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou... told me you... were thirty,\u201d Alicia said cautiously.</p><p>He cleared his throat and glanced at his brothers, then at Lelandi. Their faces were expectant, almost pitying. He had never expected to fall in love with a woman who would be newly turned. He wasn\u2019t sure how to acclimate her to their ways without upsetting her. Then he squeezed her hand as her eyes filled with worry and questioning.</p><p>\u201cThirty in human years. In werewolf? We have a very slow aging process. Once we turn eighteen, the aging process slows down. Many humans look youthful for years\u2014and it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what age they are, but for us, the length of time is even longer. Charles II was crowned the King of Scots at Scone, the year I was born. The same year that the English forbade the transportation of goods produced in the colonies to England on non-English ships.\u201d</p><p>Alicia glanced at Lelandi. She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not quite that old. But any man who would ask a woman\u2019s age is not a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>Jake raised his brows at Lelandi, then turned to Alicia. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason we can\u2019t go to jail. Let\u2019s say the men did get life in prison. They would outlive everyone. And appear to age way too slowly. If they\u2019re not one of those who have very few human influences in their family roots, like Lelandi, a royal, they would have to shift sometime during the phases of the moon. Except for the new moon.\u201d</p><p>He paused and stroked her hand again. \u201cCan you imagine what the prison guards would say if they caught their prisoners pacing in their cells as wolves? Orange prison jumpsuits lying on the floor? The two men gone? If we determine they\u2019re not werewolves, they can go to prison. You can turn them in for the bounty money even. But we\u2019ll take them down.\u201d</p> <p>Alicia took a deep breath. \u201cWhat if they are wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe take care of ours in our own way. They won\u2019t get away with murder, Alicia.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and slid her free hand over his thigh. He smiled at her, sure that the look was as hungry as he felt for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you plan to do today?\u201d Darien asked Jake. \u201cA couple of police detectives investigating the break-in at Alicia\u2019s motel in Crestview called earlier this morning and said they wanted to get Alicia\u2019s statement. I said they could speak with her in an hour or so. Hopefully, she won\u2019t have the urge to shift. Beyond that, what do you intend to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to take Alicia to see Grandfather\u2019s old homestead. But I need to locate Mario Constantino and Danny Massaro, too. And find out what happened to the other two thugs that vanished from the motel. The one she bit and the other who got away without injury. I need to learn if any of them were wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Tom and Peter check out the motel she was staying at. See if they can pick up any wolf scents. You stay here with Alicia,\u201d Darien said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hide from him,\u201d Alicia said. \u201cI worry about your family.\u201d She pointedly looked at Lelandi and her pregnant condition. \u201cThese men are ruthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying with us. You\u2019re not going to act as bait,\u201d Jake said, pointedly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think we\u2019re truly up against, Jake?\u201d Darien asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen some of these men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who tried to force Alicia out of the restaurant was human. The one she shot on the hiking trail and the other with him were also humans. I don\u2019t know about Mario. The air conditioner was blowing in the wrong direction for me to get a whiff of him. I never even considered he might be a wolf.\u201d He paused and looked at Alicia. \u201cYou\u2019re perfectly sure Ferdinand was the one who bit you and no one else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the only one with me. When I came to, I\u2019d been bitten. The two men who were interrogating him before they murdered him didn\u2019t know I was there. I doubt another man\u2014werewolf\u2014was there, then conveniently disappeared after he had bitten me. Come to think of it, I did smell that a wolf had been in the room. At first, I thought it was just me. But all wolves give off a slightly different odor. I only got a whiff of the odor of decay from Ferdinand\u2019s body since he\u2019d been dead several hours before I could leave his apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Jake considered the situation a moment more before speaking. \u201cIf Ferdinand Massaro was a wolf, then what about his brother, Danny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re cousins to Mario,\u201d Alicia explained.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d say it\u2019s very likely they could also be, but their henchmen are not,\u201d Darien said. \u201cI\u2019ll make some inquiries into this Mario Constantino.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s jaw tightened. Darien was the pack leader and it was his job to go after Mario, who was like the pack leader of a gang of thugs, whether he was a wolf or not. But Jake wanted to take Mario down. Call it the instinct to prove to his mate that he loved her, that he had the mettle and the intelligence necessary to take down the bastard who had threatened her, but he wanted to take more of a role in this.</p><p>Alicia\u2019s gaze met his, and recognition dawned that he was feeling antsy about this whole situation. She said softly, \u201cIf you want to go and chase after the bad guys, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Then it hit him. He didn\u2019t need to go after anyone. He needed to be right here\u2014with her, for her. He wasn\u2019t leaving her alone again.</p><p>He smiled evilly at her. \u201cLast time you sent me away, you tore off without a word. That\u2019s not happening again. Besides, like I said, I\u2019m sticking by your side.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand in a way that said she was happy with his decision.</p><p>When the police from Crestview arrived to get Alicia\u2019s story about the men breaking into her motel room and the one man\u2019s death, they brought her purse and suitcase, for which she was grateful. They\u2019d kept her gun, though, because she\u2019d shot and killed one of the men who\u2019d broken into her room.</p><p>She was more than nervous as Jake sat beside her in the great room filled with soft sofas and chairs enough for a big crowd. The room\u2019s high, vaulted ceilings made it appear even more spacious, while more of Jake\u2019s beautiful photographs adorned the walls. She wondered if he\u2019d taken some of his photographs to the art gallery in Breckenridge because he\u2019d run out of room in the house to hang any more.</p><p>Jake held her hand while Lelandi sat on the couch nearby, and Sheriff Peter, Darien, and Tom remained standing as they listened in.</p><p>Before the police detectives arrived, Jake had explained to Alicia how important it was to tell as much of the truth as she could to match the details of what the police might have uncovered without letting the werewolf tale out of the bag. She couldn\u2019t help but be nervous as Jake\u2019s family watched her, well aware that if she screwed this up and the police determined what really had happened, Jake and his brothers would most likely have to turn these detectives.</p><p>But she knew she must look as guilty as she felt about having to lie. Just as guilty as the people looked when she came for them as a bounty hunter with warrants for their arrest in hand.</p><p>Notebook and shining silver pen in hand, a dark-haired, mustached Detective Simpson now sat in a chair, leaning forward, intimidating, while his blond-haired, blue-eyed partner whose tie was just as blue, Detective Tandy, was standing nearby. Tandy had his hands shoved in pockets, his appearance solemn, trying for relaxed, but he was studying her every body movement, every hint of facial expression, waiting for her to give herself away before she even spoke.</p><p>Garnering her attention again, Detective Simpson said, \u201cTell us in your own words what happened exactly.\u201d His voice was calm, but his posture denoted something else. He appeared ready to pounce if she said one thing that wasn\u2019t in line with his view of the crime scene.</p><p>She swallowed hard, her hand clammy in Jake\u2019s. He squeezed her hand lightly to reassure her. And instantly both men\u2019s gazes refocused on Alicia and Jake\u2019s clasped hands. She feared she would get nothing past them but the God\u2019s honest truth. And that she couldn\u2019t give.</p><p>\u201cI... I was asleep when I heard someone trying to break into my room at the Crestview Motel. At first, I thought it was just a dream. I recalled someone was trying to unlock the door with a plastic card. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do at first. But then I realized my gun was in my bag on the other side of the room. I rushed over to get it. When the man entered, using a flashlight to find his way, I was standing in a dark corner of the room. He saw the bed was empty and went into the bathroom. I heard him jerk the shower curtain aside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you recognize him?\u201d the detective asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, he was the man who tried to force me to leave Victoriana\u2019s Restaurant in Breckenridge. I assumed he worked for Mario Constantino, the man I was tailing. I had information that Mario was meeting Danny Massaro, the man I intended to serve a warrant on.\u201d</p><p>Alicia took a deep breath. So far, so good. Everything she\u2019d said was the absolute truth.</p> <p>Detective Simpson scribbled some notes, then looked up at her. \u201cHow could you see him so clearly? The room was dark. He couldn\u2019t see you. He only had a flashlight. How did you know him?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d seen him because she was a wolf. She would have sworn, if she didn\u2019t know any better, that her heart had stopped beating. But with her silence, her trying to come up with an explanation, the way her body heated with panicked concern, she worried she was signing these men\u2019s death warrants or fates as werewolves if she didn\u2019t come up with something fast that sounded plausible.</p><p>She gave a little nonchalant shrug, never taking her eyes off the detective, not wanting to see how Darien and the others were reacting or what the other detective was doing. Watching her? Watching them? She knew that if she saw their expressions, she\u2019d fall apart more than she felt she was doing now.</p><p>\u201cI assumed it was him from his build and the way he walked. When he was at the restaurant, he reminded me of a big disgruntled bear. I suppose, in retrospect, I didn\u2019t really know for sure who he was until I felt his pulse after I shot him. Once I\u2019d seen him up close, I realized it was him. He must have followed me to Crestview.\u201d She frowned in feigned annoyance. \u201cI forgot where I left off.\u201d</p><p>She wondered if that had been a ploy on the detective\u2019s part to disconcert her. Or if he was used to asking questions when they popped into his mind. He was right in asking her the question. She just wished she hadn\u2019t made the slip. Then again, she supposed that made her appear more human.</p> <p>The detective flipped back a page in his notebook and said, \u201cYou said you heard him jerk the shower curtain aside in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes. When he realized I wasn\u2019t in the bathroom, he returned to the bedroom. That\u2019s when he saw me in the corner of the room. He raised his gun and fired. I responded by firing three times in return. Because he was holding the flashlight, I was able to pinpoint him better. He dropped his gun and sank to the floor. I worried others might be with him because the men usually travel in pairs, so I ran to lock the door, then checked his pulse to see if he was still alive. He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI dressed.\u201d She\u2019d been naked. She couldn\u2019t tell the detective that. Wouldn\u2019t he wonder why? She faltered. \u201cI mean, I changed out of my nightgown and into jeans and a sweatshirt.\u201d</p><p>Now she sounded damned suspicious. He could have assumed she\u2019d been dressed in her nightgown already. She was getting rattled. Calm down, she told herself. She swallowed hard, her throat dry as a drought in summer. Now she wished she\u2019d had some water to drink. But if she asked for any, she\u2019d sound like she was getting nervous because she was guilty of a crime.</p><p>Tom slipped out of the room, catching her eye and everyone else\u2019s. She wished she was free to go also.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Miss Greiston,\u201d the detective prompted.</p> <p>\u201cI went to call the police, but when I punched in the number and held the receiver to my ear, I discovered the phone line was dead. My cell phone battery had run down so I was charging it and hoped it would work. I was able to use it to call 9-1-1. But then another man tried to get in. He tried the doorknob, found it locked, and then began kicking the door in.\u201d</p><p>This was the hard part. How had she gotten past two armed men without getting herself killed? The one had undoubtedly left more shell casings behind from shooting wildly into the sky. But she hadn\u2019t had her gun with her. Not when she\u2019d been tearing out of there as a wolf. And she\u2019d left the gun behind, along with her cell phone and purse and everything. How could she have managed to escape them as a woman without any weapons?</p><p>\u201cSo only one other man was there?\u201d the detective asked, pen and brows raised.</p><p>If there was only one other, the detective might have figured she had slipped past him and then he fired at her but missed. But how could she have avoided two gun-toting men? But what if there had been eyewitnesses? Oh, my God, what if someone had seen a wolf run across the parking lot?</p><p>\u201cMiss Greiston?\u201d</p><p>She jerked her head up to look at him. \u201cTwo of them. I was hiding in the dark. The one went to check on the guy I\u2019d... killed, while the other hurried into the bathroom, looking for me. At least I presume. I dashed outside. Someone fired three shots, but I kept running and never looked back.\u201d</p><p>Tom returned to the great room with a glass of water and handed it to her.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, her eyes meeting his, his expression telling her she was doing fine. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said again and took a swallow of the cold water.</p> <p>\u201cDid you have a dog with you in the room?\u201d the detective asked in a consoling manner, his blue eyes fixed on her gaze.</p><p>She knew his ploy. Pretend to understand the perp\u2019s situation, then throw the book at him or her. Just as she\u2019d often done. Only in the case of the men and women she arrested, they were the bad guys.</p><p>\u201cA dog?\u201d she asked, her voice barely audible.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, in truth, a wolf.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s hand tightened fractionally on Alicia\u2019s. Her teeth were clenched together, and she didn\u2019t know what to say. She was innocent, but if these men pushed her too hard, Jake and his family would be forced to turn them. She didn\u2019t think the pack could kill them. That scenario would be too difficult to explain. But if they turned them, they\u2019d have to take them into the pack, and Darien had already said he didn\u2019t want two more newly turned pack members\u2014male types, who probably had families of their own. And that would cause an even greater ripple effect of trouble.</p><p>The detective flipped through his notebook as if he needed to refresh his memory on the details of his investigation. She was certain this time it was a ploy to make her squirm. She didn\u2019t squirm, although she felt light-headed and was afraid her face had drained of all color. She was barely breathing, and Jake looked anxiously at her. She scolded herself for not hiding her feelings better, but she couldn\u2019t help it. They knew something. About the wolf.</p><p>And she was feeling damn guilty. How could she not? She\u2019d bitten one of the two men. She was guilty! Nothing in her bounty hunter training said she could bite a perp into submission. Not that she had been after these guys, but still...</p><p>The detective tapped his pen at the open page. \u201cSays here two men in the room next to yours saw a dog run out of your room. A big dog. Like a German shepherd. They never saw any sign of a woman leaving. One of the men had fired into the air, scared by the size of the wolf.\u201d</p><p>Wolf. Twice he\u2019d referred to it as a wolf. But if the eyewitnesses thought it was a dog, why did the detective think it was a wolf?</p><p>The detective flipped through some more pages of his notebook, while the other one continued to watch her expression. Her blood ran cold. She didn\u2019t want to say the wrong thing and force Darien\u2019s hand. But she didn\u2019t know what to say that wouldn\u2019t cause trouble for their kind.</p><p>\u201cBlood was found on the rug near the door. A man\u2019s blood. But not the same as the blood from the one who died. Wolf saliva was mixed in with the second man\u2019s blood.\u201d The detective looked up from his notes. \u201cSo what about the wolf?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach bunched tightly into a knot, Alicia licked her suddenly very dry lips. Yet, she thought the detective was feeding her a story. No one would look to see if saliva was a wolf\u2019s or a dog\u2019s, would they?</p><p>\u201cWolf saliva?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou mean, canine saliva, right? Is there a difference between a dog\u2019s and a wolf\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d the detective said with a smug expression, \u201cThe saliva sampled from the bite marks was wolf DNA. They can determine that to rule out that it wasn\u2019t some other animal\u2019s bites.\u201d</p><p>She took a shallow breath and said, \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not illegal to own a wolf,\u201d Jake interjected, his voice quietly firm, as if he was a lawyer who knew her rights when it came to pet wolf ownership.</p><p>She supposed that to protect themselves, Jake and the rest of the pack would know about such a thing for self-preservation.</p><p>The detective switched his attention to Jake. She thought Detective Simpson was fighting a smile. Jake to the rescue. But it was more than that. It was as if the detective had caught them in a falsehood. But she wasn\u2019t rolling over and playing dead yet.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right, Mr. Silver,\u201d the detective said with emphasis, \u201cnot unless the wolf owner takes the wolf within the city limits of some cities, which is illegal. Crestview is not one of those cities. But the wolves have to be fenced in with at least eight-foot-tall fencing. Every access has to be locked to prevent the wolves from escaping.</p><p>\u201cTaking a wolf into a motel room isn\u2019t legal, nor a safe thing to do. If Miss Greiston was afraid for her life and was using the wolf for protection, it wasn\u2019t really a smart idea. Nor was it legal. The wolf could have injured anyone. Since it has bitten someone now, we\u2019ll have to hunt it down and make sure it wasn\u2019t rabid.\u201d He sat taller and turned to Alicia. \u201cSo what about this wolf, Miss Greiston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t mine,\u201d she said stubbornly, head held high, voice confident.</p><p>The detective raised his brows.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t own any pets. Never have. I don\u2019t know where the animal came from or where he went. You can check with my apartment manager. I\u2019ve never had any pets at the place. They\u2019re not allowed.\u201d</p><p>At least the part about not owning any pets was true. But what if they checked out the hotel rooms where she\u2019d stayed over the past month? What if they found wolf hairs on the carpet where she\u2019d restlessly paced, trying to shift back into her human body? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe wolf ran off into the woods, the eyewitnesses said.\u201d The detective studied her for a moment more, then asked, \u201cBut where did you go? Why did you run away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake came for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d left your phone charging on the dresser. Only one phone call had been made. To 9-1-1. The sound of the men breaking into the room was captured on tape. They heard the one man cursing up a blue streak as he said, \u2018Come on, Cicero, damn it. We\u2019ve gotta get out of here before the police arrive. She\u2019s run off. Holy crap.\u2019 Then there was a lot of grunting and groaning and moaning. We assume that was when he helped the injured man outside. After several minutes, doors were opened and slammed shut. Then a car engine roared to life, and the vehicle tore off down the road. Detective Tandy and I arrived shortly after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had guns, Detective. I wasn\u2019t about to hang around to get shot at again. If they could have, they would have come after me, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo how did Mr. Silver know to meet you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had prearranged a meeting.\u201d She patted Jake\u2019s hand with her free hand. \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing each other. We planned to get together last night. Only instead of finding me at the motel, he found me on the road heading for Silver Town.\u201d</p><p>The detective\u2019s brows arched heavenward. \u201cLong hike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know where else to go, and I was sure Jake was already headed to Crestview. I couldn\u2019t hang around to get shot at again,\u201d she repeated. Then she had to explain her connection to Danny Massaro, who had also murdered her mother, and the other, Cicero, who she hadn\u2019t seen before.</p><p>After two long, exhausting hours, the detectives finally left and Alicia felt drained. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe me about the wolf,\u201d she said to the family as Darien walked back into the great room after seeing the detectives out.</p> <p>\u201cYou did fine,\u201d Darien said, his tone reassuring, and she believed he really meant it. \u201cThey won\u2019t find a wolf, and Peter has learned that the man you bit never went to any hospital or clinic in the area to get the wound taken care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to have been awful,\u201d Alicia whispered, still feeling bad about what she\u2019d done. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to bite so hard, but I... I think I crushed the bone. I didn\u2019t know my own strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he died,\u201d Darien said, matter-of-factly. \u201cPeter had already talked to the eyewitnesses, and they said the one man was practically carrying the other out to the car. The injured man slumped in the seat, his face ice white. If Danny Massaro had to take him someplace any distance from the motel, the man probably died. We know for sure he didn\u2019t take him to any area medical facilities. Peter\u2019s already checked. We still want to confirm the man died, but it appears that way.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes at Darien. \u201cIf you already knew that the men had seen a dog, why didn\u2019t you tell me before the detectives arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witnesses hadn\u2019t mentioned a dog,\u201d Peter said, speaking up in Darien\u2019s defense. \u201cI had asked them about the men who had broken into your room, trying to get a description so we could locate them before the police did. The witnesses said the parking lot was dark. And so was the walk in front of the motel because the men had knocked out the lights.</p><p>\u201cBut when the car\u2019s interior lights came on, the injured man looked pale as death, and the other man was shaking him and hollering at him. The wounded man was unresponsive. The other was cursing as he backed out of the parking lot and roared off. I assumed you\u2019d shot the other man, too. I didn\u2019t realize you had bitten him.\u201d Peter looked contrite. \u201cIt was my fault that I didn\u2019t think to ask the witnesses if they\u2019d seen anything else near your room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a question for you though, Alicia,\u201d Darien said, his look stern. \u201cWhy did Danny Massaro and Mario Constantino kill your mother?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Alicia was already upset by all of the police detective questioning she\u2019d had to endure, so Jake wondered why in the hell Darien had to bring up the motive for her mother\u2019s murder on top of all that. Jake knew Darien had good reasons for anything he did, but the timing seemed piss-poor.</p><p>But Alicia didn\u2019t seem upset by the query. Instead, her lips parted, and she seemed surprised.</p><p>She cleared her throat and held herself stiffly on the couch. \u201cMario had my mother murdered because she was seeing a man named Tony Thomas. Mario had him murdered as well. Why? I don\u2019t know. I speculated it was because Tony was either copping a deal with the Feds, incriminating Mario in his sordid operations, or trying to go into business for himself.\u201d</p><p>She sounded as if the notion didn\u2019t make any difference. Only the end results mattered, maybe because that\u2019s all she dealt with in her line of work. The reason why the perp didn\u2019t show up for trial or see his or her parole officer wasn\u2019t important. Nor was the reason he had committed the crime. All that mattered was that the person was returned to jail.</p><p>Suspecting he already knew the answer, Jake ran his hand over hers in an attempt to put her at ease. \u201cWhy would Mario want you dead, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI planned to put him behind bars. Then I turned him in to the cops.\u201d</p> <p>That was what he\u2019d thought. \u201cSince Danny came after you, the police must not have incarcerated Danny and possibly not Mario, either.\u201d That thought gave Jake major heartburn. These men seemed intent on getting to Alicia, and she wouldn\u2019t be safe until they were stopped.</p><p>Alicia dropped her gaze to their locked hands. \u201cMaybe my mother knew something about Tony\u2019s business or Mario\u2019s. Maybe something was going on.\u201d She didn\u2019t say anything for several minutes. Then in a voice that was hollow with defeat, she said, \u201cThen again, I hadn\u2019t wanted to know. I reasoned that the less I knew, the better. But now...\u201d</p><p>She took a deep, shaky breath and met his gaze, her eyes swimming in tears. \u201cMaybe if I had known more of what was going on in my mother\u2019s life, I could have put Mario and Danny in prison. Maybe I could have stopped Danny from murdering her.\u201d She looked weary and overcome.</p><p>Darien wanted to drop the subject, to give her time to deal with the changes in her life, but they had to know if something her mother had in her possession might further incriminate Mario. If the man was only human, they could turn the evidence over to the police. If he was one of the wolf kind, that could be a different story. But Darien wanted to know if there was more of a connection between Alicia and Mario, and that\u2019s why Mario continued to target her.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of relationship did you have with Tony? Your mother\u2019s boyfriend who was murdered. How well did you know him?\u201d</p><p>Alicia\u2019s jaw tightened as she stared at the coffee table. Jake wondered if there was more to the story than she had let on.</p><p>\u201cSometimes... sometimes I thought he was trying to be the father I never had. I thought maybe he was planning on marrying my mother.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t need a father. Hadn\u2019t had one all those years. And at my age, why now? But at other times\u201d\u2014she looked up at Jake\u2014\u201che would distance himself as if he was afraid to know me. Like he was afraid for me to know him. Which was probably because he was tied to the Mob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Tony ever jealous of your relationship with your mother?\u201d Jake thought that could very well be the case.</p><p>Alicia shook her head with conviction. \u201cNo. That was the oddest thing. He seemed to appreciate my close relationship with Mom. As if I was good for her. I often wondered why he wouldn\u2019t resent that she and I were such good friends. Instead, he seemed to admire our relationship. I don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019d never had a mother or father who was there for him growing up. Or maybe he\u2019d been close to his mom and understood.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t exactly like the other men she dated. They were... never intimate with her like Tony was. He tried to hide his affections for my mother when he was with her around me. But even so, I\u2019d catch a shared kiss. Him holding her hand. A warm embrace. The other men were just... there. Accompanying her. I never saw any sign of affection or intimacy.\u201d</p><p>That seemed strange to Jake. \u201cWhere are your mother\u2019s things? Did you go through them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my apartment. She\u2019d had a furnished apartment in Dillon. She didn\u2019t have many personal effects. And mostly at the end, she\u2019d been living with Tony in his condo. I gave away all her clothes to the women\u2019s abuse center. There wasn\u2019t much left. I didn\u2019t really take time to look through her things. I never thought she might have anything incriminating against Mario. I... I haven\u2019t returned to my place for the past month, afraid these men would know I\u2019d lived there, and one of them would be waiting for me to show up. So I\u2019ve just paid the bills and stayed clear of the place.\u201d</p><p>That was why Jake dreamed that Alicia was in different beds when they made love in their dream states every night. He looked over at Darien to get his okay for what he was about to do next. Darien nodded, giving him his consent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you back to your apartment,\u201d Jake said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if we can find anything, evidence, something that will clue us in if there was more of a connection to you than you believe. I have a sneaking hunch that Mario coming after you has more to do with you than your attempt at putting him behind bars. And I halfway suspect when we arrive at your place, it\u2019ll look like a tornado hit it.\u201d</p><p>The drive to Alicia\u2019s apartment seemed to take forever as Jake chauffeured her in his truck, while Peter and Tom rode in Peter\u2019s Suburban as their backup guard. Pete wore his sheriff\u2019s uniform, although he\u2019d be out of his jurisdiction.</p><p>Their presence was more than comforting, especially since Alicia couldn\u2019t take her gun with her since the police still had it. But she was armed with a can of pepper spray.</p><p>She\u2019d been alone for so long that she enjoyed the sense of belonging that Jake\u2019s pack members had offered her. She still hadn\u2019t come to complete terms with being mated to Jake forever or all the strange things she was learning about her werewolfism and pack-member politics. She could only swallow the news in little bites. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the worry of what she might find at her apartment was overshadowed by the concern she might be pregnant. She clenched and unclenched her hands, then finally said, \u201cCan we stop at a drugstore? There\u2019s one in the strip mall on the corner before we reach my apartment.\u201d</p><p>She figured if she had to shop at a drugstore in Silver Town, the whole pack might know what she purchased. That was one bad thing about the closeness of a pack, she was learning. And Lelandi had said most of the businesses were werewolf run. Alicia imagined even Lisa, the manager of the lingerie shop, might have told everyone what Jake had bought for her there. Lelandi wouldn\u2019t have, though. Alicia felt Lelandi was one person who wouldn\u2019t give her secrets away. Unless keeping them might harm the pack.</p><p>Jake was silent for so long that Alicia thought she\u2019d spoken so softly he hadn\u2019t heard. But with their wolf hearing, she decided that wasn\u2019t it. She assumed he was trying to figure out why she needed to stop at the drugstore.</p> <p>He finally nodded and grabbed his phone off his belt and punched a button. \u201cTom? We\u2019re making a stop at a corner drugstore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need to come inside with us,\u201d Alicia quickly said. She didn\u2019t need the whole world to know what she was up to.</p><p>He glanced at her, then said to his brother, \u201cYou can wait outside for us. It\u2019ll only take us a minute. Right.\u201d Then he put his phone away. He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, but she could tell by his furrowed brow that he was bothered by her request. Then he said, \u201cWhat is it that you need?\u201d</p><p>She raised her brows at him. \u201cIs nothing sacred?\u201d</p><p>He gave her the wolfish grin that melted her insides to mush. \u201cNot between us. Not now that we\u2019re mates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, so if I wanted to probe into your deepest, most private fantasies or past history, you\u2019d freely tell me about all of it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He reached over with his big hand and squeezed her thigh in a way that made her shiver with interest. \u201cYou only have to ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Well, I want to get a pregnancy kit, and I don\u2019t want anyone else in your pack...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur pack knowing about it. They might get the wrong notion.\u201d Like it was Jake\u2019s child, if she were pregnant. She swallowed hard, hating that she\u2019d have to admit if she was pregnant that it was Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s child.</p><p>Jake ran his hand over her thigh in a tender caress meant to console. Then his mouth curved up and his hand slid to her belly. \u201cWhen Mary called from the gallery with the news you were pregnant, I was angry. I thought you had another man in your life and hadn\u2019t told me. But I couldn\u2019t be more pleased if you\u2019re having a baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost men wouldn\u2019t like it if it was some other man\u2019s baby,\u201d she said, trying not to sound so disconsolate.</p><p>He drove into the parking lot of the strip mall and parked, then rested his hand beneath her chin and lifted and turned her to face him, his eyes pinning hers with resolve. \u201cI love you. And if you\u2019re pregnant, the baby\u2019s ours. I\u2019ll raise her as my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolves in our pack statistically have fewer females. So we\u2019re always hopeful we\u2019ll have a few more females\u2014keeps the males from getting too rambunctious.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d hear a man say he\u2019d rather have a little girl than a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving two brothers probably had something to do with it.\u201d He cut the engine.</p><p>She knew he was teasing. By the way he spoke to his brothers, she could tell he was really close to them. She had barely opened the truck\u2019s door when Jake hurried around the front of the vehicle to help her down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to add running boards,\u201d he said, as he held her hips and helped her hop down to the pavement. \u201cIf you are pregnant, you\u2019ll never be able to climb up into the cab.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot without a forklift,\u201d she teased, trying to feel better about it.</p><p>He smiled down at her but then said, \u201cWould you agree to see Doc Weber? He\u2019d be discreet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would people think who saw me join the pack, then immediately see the doctor?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>Peter drove up beside them and parked, and Alicia suddenly was aware that he and Tom were watching them both. She hoped the guys couldn\u2019t read lips or hear their conversation through the Suburban windows.</p><p>\u201cBe just a minute,\u201d Jake said to Tom as he rolled the window down.</p><p>\u201cSure you don\u2019t want us to watch your backs?\u201d Tom asked, his expression concerned.</p><p>Alicia was touched by the way he genuinely seemed worried about her, but she quickly shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>Tom gave Jake a look, and she couldn\u2019t tell if it was because she was making the decisions without allowing Jake to have a say or because Tom suspected something else was going on. But it made her even more self-conscious, and she hurried Jake into the drugstore before her whole heated body gave her away.</p><p>Tom watched Jake and Alicia head into the drugstore as Peter leaned back against the driver\u2019s seat of his Suburban and said, \u201cWonder what that\u2019s all about that she didn\u2019t want us to see what she had to purchase.\u201d</p><p>Tom didn\u2019t want to speculate, but he couldn\u2019t help it. Alicia was definitely anxious about something. He\u2019d never seen a more expressive woman, unable to hide her feelings like his kind normally could do. He supposed it was because they\u2019d been born as wolves.</p><p>After seeing how much Alicia had gotten under Jake\u2019s skin, how much he really cared for her, Tom was damned worried she was going to get herself killed over this situation with Constantino and his thugs, though.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help worrying about both Alicia and Jake, and how Jake would deal with losing her again, if it came to that. He\u2019d been unable to focus on work or anything in the pack during the last several weeks after he\u2019d lost Alicia. But Tom assumed Jake had continued to believe she was all right. Then there was that damnable business of chasing after her without any pack backup when she was in trouble in Crestview. Hell, Darien had curbed his anger, wanting everything to turn out for the best, but he\u2019d been furious with Jake for not waiting for Tom and Peter to catch up to him. Jake wanted her to be safe, sure, but Darien didn\u2019t want to lose his brother in the process.</p><p>If anything happened to her now, Jake would be devastated. And Tom couldn\u2019t let him down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Jake allow a woman to order him around,\u201d Peter said, his tone solemn. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him fall so hard for a woman. She\u2019s something special.\u201d</p><p>Those were Tom\u2019s sentiments as well.</p><p>Peter glanced at him. \u201cYou seem awfully quiet, Tom. What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>That the woman had gotten under Tom\u2019s skin, too. How could she not when Jake had fallen in love with her? Lelandi had found a new friend in her also. Alicia\u2019s sadness concerned Tom, and he wondered whether she\u2019d be happy with their pack. It didn\u2019t even matter that Alicia was new to being a werewolf. They\u2019d make sure she felt she\u2019d been with them forever. But something was the matter, and he suspected there was more to the story than just the trouble with Mario and his gang.</p><p>Tom cleared his throat when he realized Peter was watching him, waiting for a response. \u201cMaybe Jake felt we didn\u2019t need to go in. He might have thought we\u2019d be more protection if we watched the front door while they went inside.\u201d</p><p>But Tom knew that wasn\u2019t the case. Sure, Jake had to have felt it was safe enough for Alicia since he hadn\u2019t insisted that Tom and Peter come inside even if she objected. But Tom couldn\u2019t for the life of him think of what had her so bothered that she would be afraid for others in the pack to know. Maybe it was a female thing.</p><p>Peter rubbed his chin and stared at the door, then dropped his hand away and shook his head. \u201cI heard her vehemently say we didn\u2019t need to come inside. So that made me wonder what she didn\u2019t want us to see that she was buying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a woman\u2019s thing, Peter,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>But Tom still wondered what was going on with Alicia. He couldn\u2019t help thinking about that morning and how red her eyes had been when she\u2019d first come down for breakfast. Jake had been tense, ready to defend her, from the way he had hovered over her. Something was wrong. Not that Tom had thought it had anything to do with the trip to the drugstore. Then again, maybe it did.</p><p>A few minutes later when Alicia walked out with Jake, his arm around her waist and escorting her to his truck, Tom eyed the small package she carried. Her expression was glum. Jake\u2019s wasn\u2019t any more cheerful than hers. If it hadn\u2019t been for the trip to the drugstore, Tom might have thought they were just concerned about what they might find at the apartment, and further, what they might discover among Alicia\u2019s mother\u2019s things. But the small package made him think something else was the matter.</p><p>\u201cCondoms?\u201d Peter asked, as he started the engine, then pulled in behind Jake as the truck headed back onto the street.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t wear condoms when we have a mate. Hell, we don\u2019t ever wear condoms. No need.\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t say anything right away, but then he cast Tom a sly smile. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s afraid of having triplets since they run in your family.\u201d</p><p>Poor Jake, if that was the case. No wonder he looked so glum.</p><p>Normally, Jake and Tom could talk about anything and often did, even about Darien when he had been in such a black mood before Lelandi came into his life. But Jake had refused to tell Tom what had been bothering him while he\u2019d been frantically trying to locate Alicia. Tom and Darien had talked at length about what could have been upsetting Jake, assuming it had to do with the woman who\u2019d been in the shower running in the background that Darien had heard over the phone.</p><p>Tom sighed. No matter what, when he found the right woman to mate, he wouldn\u2019t be anything but bowled over with joy.</p><p>The most noticeable things about Alicia\u2019s redbrick, two-story building were the gardens in front of each of the townhouses. Alicia\u2019s was overflowing with vibrant red roses and golden sunflowers and yellow daisies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake pulled a gun from his glove box, and Alicia\u2019s eyes widened. He patted her leg. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t have a gun with me when I first saw you in Breckenridge. But it seems prudent that I take a gun with me anytime I go out with you now.\u201d He pulled out a lock pick set and helped her out of the truck.</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cLock picks? I\u2019ve got my keys.\u201d She patted her purse. \u201cWhy do you have lock picks?\u201d</p><p>He was so accustomed to using lock picks to get into places that weren\u2019t family owned that he hadn\u2019t even thought about her keys. \u201cMost of us carry these in case we have an urgent need to get inside a building and hide ourselves. If there\u2019s a wolf on the premises, I\u2019ll have to shift quickly and deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, sounding surprised.</p><p>Her response reminded him how newly turned she was and how difficult it had to be for her to think in terms of being a werewolf or that others might also be werewolves and had to be dealt with differently.</p><p>Peter and Tom joined them at Alicia\u2019s apartment door and hovered close as Jake said quietly, \u201cTom, I want you to stay with Alicia until Peter and I make sure the place is all clear.\u201d</p><p>Using her key, Jake unlocked the door, and with guns drawn, he and Peter stepped inside the house. The place was quiet, and Tom and Alicia remained in the entryway watching their progress.</p><p>Jake lifted his nose and took a good strong whiff, just like the others did. He smelled the telltale scents of several men who had been here recently. Pungent colognes, primarily. The odor of male testosterone and sweat. And the faint odor of wolf. Male wolf.</p> <p>He and Peter quickly scanned the small living room, which was filled with a blue floral couch and two solid-blue love seats, a light-oak coffee table and a couple of end tables, leaving nowhere for anyone to hide. A cheerful yellow kitchen was just beyond the living area, and in an open dining room were a glass table and wrought-iron chairs but nothing else. The bar divided the kitchen from the living room, however, and anyone could be crouching behind it.</p><p>Jake motioned for Peter to follow him and they quietly strode to the kitchen, but he shook his head at Alicia and Tom when they found no one there.</p><p>A creaking noise in the bedroom floor upstairs caught everyone\u2019s attention. No one said a word as Jake and Peter quietly stalked up the carpeted stairs, Jake leading the way. He wasn\u2019t sure what he would face\u2014a wolf or a man. But he smelled the scent of a wolf and a man on the way up the stairs. If the man was in his human form, he\u2019d be armed and dangerous. If he was a wolf, Jake would take care of the problem once and for all.</p><p>When they reached the landing, a short wall half-protected a suited man with his gun aimed for a kill, but Jake saw the man before he could fire the shots. Jake ducked into a crouch behind the wall. Three pops rang in the air. Three bullets slammed into the wall behind Jake with a thunk, thunk, thunk.</p><p>Peter whipped around the low wall at a crouch and fired, hitting the man twice in the arm and making him drop his weapon. The man collapsed on the floor and passed out. Jake cursed under his breath and then rushed forward to feel the injured man\u2019s pulse. His pulse was thready, but the man was alive.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d Jake called out, loud enough for Alicia and Tom to know that everyone was all right.</p> <p>The injured man wasn\u2019t a wolf. Someone else had been here, though, who was a male werewolf.</p><p>Jake kicked the gun away from the gunman and then rummaged through his pockets, looking for any ID. None. Not that he\u2019d expected to find any.</p><p>Peter stalked into the bathroom. \u201cNo one in the laundry room or bathroom,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cCall the local police, Peter. We\u2019ll have him hauled off and then take care of our business here.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, nothing seemed to be out of place. Jake assumed that was an attempt by Mario\u2019s man to give the appearance that no one had been there. Then if Alicia had arrived, she would have felt safe as she entered her apartment. The man would have waited like a venomous snake until she reached the bedroom and then would have pounced on her.</p><p>The bedcovers were tousled where the gunman appeared to have been lying down, waiting for Alicia to show up. He must have heard them downstairs, thinking Alicia had come home. Jake wondered just how long the man had been here waiting for her. Maybe only since the night before because the men seemed to have been tailing her before they lost her at the Crestview Motel.</p><p>Mario might have thought she\u2019d finally return here with no place else to go.</p><p>Jake headed back down the stairs as Peter watched the man while calling the shooting in to the police. \u201cThis is Sheriff Peter Jorgenson of Silver Town, calling about a shooting incident at 452 Sunnybrook Apartments.\u201d</p> <p>Jake caught Alicia\u2019s pale features as he hurried to join her at the front door. \u201cThe man\u2019s passed out but just wounded. He won\u2019t be firing another gun for a good long while.\u201d He took her in his arms and gave her a heartfelt embrace. \u201cIf you\u2019re up to it, do you want to look at him and see if he\u2019s anyone you recognize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of... course.\u201d Even though her speech was hesitant, she seemed resolute about getting this over and done with.</p><p>He rubbed her back. \u201cThe police will be here soon. They\u2019ll have more questions to ask you, I\u2019m afraid. But at least Peter shot the man, who had fired his weapon first. Although I am licensed to carry a gun. All of us are, just in case we need to be. He\u2019s human, Alicia. But a wolf has been on the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smelled the wolf, but I wouldn\u2019t know who he is.\u201d She looked toward the stairs. \u201cMy mother\u2019s things are upstairs in a linen closet.\u201d</p><p>He took her cold hand and led her up the stairs. She took a steadying breath at the top of the stairs and moved closer to the man, who was stirring now as Peter stood over him. Peter shoved his cell phone into his pocket. \u201cPolice are on their way.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes suddenly popped opened. He groaned and grabbed his bloodied arm. He saw Peter first, wearing the forest-green shirt and khaki trousers and the gold seven-point star badge identifying him as a sheriff. At that sight, the man grew very still, his dark eyes round.</p><p>\u201cWhy did Mario send you?\u201d Jake asked, his voice low and cold, which had the man jerking his head around to see Jake standing with Alicia, his hand at her stiff spine.</p><p>His gaze quickly shot to Alicia\u2019s. She said, \u201cThis man was a friend of the guy my mother was seeing. So much for being anyone\u2019s friend in their organization.\u201d</p><p>The man narrowed his eyes at Alicia. \u201cFriends take care of friends. If they turn traitorous, you stick with the guy with the most firepower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did Mario have your friend killed? Was Tony trying to take over the business?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>Sirens sounded in the distance, and when the man wouldn\u2019t answer, Jake urged again, \u201cWhat about Alicia? Why does Mario want her dead?\u201d</p><p>The gunman\u2019s gaze again swung to her. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want her dead.\u201d</p><p>She was barely breathing now. Jake rubbed her back. \u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>The guy gave a half shrug with his good arm and groaned again. \u201cHell, he wants her. I dunno why. But despite her killing one of our guys and shooting another, Mario wants her. Alive. Frankly, none of us gets it.\u201d He cast an evil half smirk at Alicia, as if to say Mario would get his way, then she\u2019d pay.</p><p>Tom shouted up the stairs, \u201cPolice and paramedics are here.\u201d</p><p>The sirens cut out in the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cSend them up, Tom.\u201d Then Jake growled at the injured man, \u201cIf you see Mario, tell him Alicia\u2019s off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who should I say said so?\u201d The guy gritted his teeth and squeezed his bloodied arm tighter as they heard the front door open and Tom telling them the man was upstairs, wounded but disarmed.</p><p>\u201cJake Silver,\u201d Jake said. \u201cOf Silver Town.\u201d</p><p>Might as well give Mario an invitation to visit the pack. See if he had the fortitude to try and grab Alicia there. If he was a wolf, and Jake was beginning to think so, they\u2019d have to take him down in their own territory where they could handle the matter much more discreetly.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIf I see him, I\u2019ll pass along the word. He likes dealing with a guy with steel balls. More of a challenge that way.\u201d</p><p>Men rushed up the stairs, four officers and two paramedics. The place was swarming with people, and with the crowd in her small bedroom, Alicia went back downstairs since she hadn\u2019t witnessed the shooting. Jake and Peter stayed to explain what had happened. Jake only hoped she wouldn\u2019t falter when the police interrogated her about the connection between this incident and the one the night before. He would have given anything to keep her from having to deal with this again.</p><p>As soon as he could return to her, he headed back downstairs to see her sitting on the blue floral couch, her hands clasped tightly together in her lap as Tom stood beside the couch in protective mode. This time, she was armed with a glass of water.</p><p>Jake joined her on the couch and held her hand to fortify her before two of the officers came downstairs to take her statement. He felt her tense, her heart beating rapidly, as she barely breathed. He squeezed her hand to reassure her, hoping to hell this would be the last case of anything like this happening.</p><p>Tom looked just as tense, and Jake knew his brother was in protective wolf mode in the event anything went wrong with the police questioning.</p><p>Alicia swallowed hard and tried to settle her raw nerves. She was afraid she\u2019d be in for even more of the third degree, considering her connection with the incident the night before. What were her ties to a mobster? She couldn\u2019t let them know about her mother\u2019s possessions in case she and Jake could uncover anything about what was going on.</p><p>One of the police detectives, a redhead with bright-green eyes and a stern look, said, \u201cI\u2019m Detective Hanover, and this is my partner, Detective Brumley.\u201d Then they both showed their badges. Detective Hanover sat down on her wide-winged armchair and opened a notebook. \u201cOkay, first can I see some ID from everyone?\u201d</p><p>Alicia dug around in her purse and swore she needed to clean it out as her fingers searched for her wallet and instead ran into a tube of lipstick, a package of tissues, a ton of receipts for motel bills, a brush, a comb, keys, and nail scissors that she managed to stab herself with in her frantic search. Finally, she grasped her leather wallet and pulled it out. Searching each of the pockets she found: credit card, library card, car insurance card, health insurance card, dental insurance card, store-points cards... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She frowned as she went through every pocket of the wallet. Where was her driver\u2019s license? She looked up to see the detective handing driver\u2019s licenses back to Jake, Tom, and Peter. Then the detective focused his attention on her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Greiston, your driver\u2019s license?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 16</p> <p>Alicia felt hot with embarrassment mixed with concern as she faced the policemen grilling her while Jake and his brother and their own sheriff gave her moral support. Where in the world had her driver\u2019s license gone? And when had she lost it?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d noticed it. \u201cI seem to have misplaced it.\u201d</p><p>Detective Hanover nodded, as if that wasn\u2019t important, that he already knew who she was. \u201cCan you tell me in your own words why you returned to your apartment with three armed men from Silver Town, one being a sheriff of the same town, and what your relationship is to everyone, Miss Greiston?\u201d</p><p>How did Alicia tell the detective she was \u201cmarried\u201d to Jake when she wasn\u2019t? Not really. She had no paper proof. And not even his name to call her own. For the first time, she realized just how much that part bothered her. The rest of the pack must have grown up with the notion and it seemed perfectly fine to them, but being tied to someone as his life mate and yet unmarried seemed unthinkable to her. And despite thinking she never wanted to marry again, considering the way she felt about Jake and her need to be with him ever since they\u2019d parted, she realized her only reason to swear off men was that she\u2019d always picked the wrong sort.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have asked for a man who was more concerned for her, more protective, and wanted to make her happy in the worst way. She\u2019d never had anyone care for her like that. How could she not want to be married to a man like that?</p> <p>But what was she to say to humans in a situation like this?</p><p>She squeezed Jake\u2019s hand. \u201cJake and I are engaged to be married.\u201d</p><p>She focused on the detective\u2019s eyes but sensed the tension in the room among Jake, Tom, and Peter. Worse, just as the words spilled from her lips, another two police officers escorted Mario\u2019s henchman down the stairs, and she was sure he\u2019d heard what she\u2019d said. If he had a chance to speak to Mario, he\u2019d tell him what she\u2019d said. Then Mario would have even more of a reason to eliminate Jake: to hurt her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t speak any further until the policemen had taken the man outside, followed by the paramedics, and then shut the door.</p><p>The officer glanced down at her hand, but Jake\u2019s hand was covering hers and hiding any ring she might be wearing.</p><p>\u201cRecent engagement?\u201d the detective asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes. We met a couple of months ago.\u201d</p><p>His brows raised and he shifted his attention to Jake, who gave him a slight smile. She was sure the detective was thinking Jake had either been suckered into the relationship or was a really fast mover.</p><p>\u201cLove at first sight,\u201d she clarified, just in case the policeman needed the clarification.</p><p>He seemed slightly amused and probably unconvinced about such a thing.</p><p>\u201cTom is Jake\u2019s brother, as I\u2019m sure you already know.\u201d She motioned to him. \u201cAnd Peter is sheriff of Silver Town,\u201d she said coolly.</p><p>\u201cSo you take a bunch of armed men to your apartment for protection, anticipating trouble. One of my partners talked to your apartment manager, and she says you have been paying the rent but haven\u2019t been here in some weeks. Why come here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came home for some personal things. Because of the trouble I had with Mario Constantino\u2019s men last night in Crestview\u2014I overhead Jake already apprise you of the situation\u2014I\u2019ve moved in with Jake and his family until we get married. But we knew I might not be safe if I came here alone or with just Jake accompanying me, after Mario\u2019s men lost me last night.\u201d</p><p>The detective leaned back in the chair, putting welcome distance between them. \u201cYou could have called us and let us check out the place first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould you have spared any men to investigate on an unfounded assumption?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a moment, then asked, \u201cDid you know the man upstairs?\u201d</p><p>This got really tricky. She tried not to reveal any emotion concerning her mother\u2019s connection, but her damned voice broke when she said, \u201cMy mother...\u201d She paused and looked down at the coffee table, trying to keep the tears flooding her eyes from spilling down her cheeks. But she couldn\u2019t control her feelings where her mother was concerned yet. \u201cShe was seeing one of the men who worked for Mario. I don\u2019t have any idea what Tony Thomas did for Mario. But my mother\u2019s association with Tony got her killed. And the guy upstairs? He was friends with the murdered man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u201d\u2014the detective leaned forward again and his steely look pinned her with the question before he even asked it\u2014\u201cwhat about you? What was your association with this man who was dating your mother before they were both murdered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. Only that I had warned her I thought he might be a member of the Mob. I worried for her safety.\u201d Her voice hardened to fight the tears. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t listen to me. She said she loved him. It got her killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure there wasn\u2019t something more to this whole case? Seems odd that Constantino would come after you when only your mother was involved with a member of the Mob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to put him back in jail where he belongs,\u201d she coldly said.</p><p>\u201cAs a bounty hunter,\u201d the detective said. \u201cWe ran a check on your background. You\u2019ve successfully brought in a number of cases, but no one that dangerous. It seems to me you\u2019re a little out of your league on this one. When it becomes a vendetta...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to kill him, just put him back in jail!\u201d She swallowed her anger. This was not helping, but Jake had said the same thing when he first met her and had triggered the response.</p><p>The detective continued in the same tranquil manner. She wished she sounded a lot more coolheaded, but she guessed that with Jake and Peter\u2019s finding Mario\u2019s man in her apartment and hearing the shots fired, and then worrying that Jake or Peter had been hit, she\u2019d been unnerved more than she thought.</p><p>\u201cDid you think Constantino would be here waiting for you today?\u201d the detective asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t be that naive. He sends his henchmen to do his dirty work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven in the event of your mother\u2019s murder?\u201d</p><p>Alicia took a steadying breath as she thought of how her mother must have been terrified in the final moments, facing Danny Massaro, his gun held out to shoot her. \u201cHe ordered the hit. But Danny Massaro did the killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you knew this how?\u201d</p><p>She felt Jake tense a hair. He hadn\u2019t asked her himself, and she hadn\u2019t thought to tell him. \u201cDanny\u2019s brother, Ferdinand Massaro, told me.\u201d</p><p>The detective quickly began taking notes, then looked up at her. \u201cWhere can he be reached?\u201d</p><p>In that moment, she knew she was doomed. The police hadn\u2019t known she knew anything about Ferdinand\u2019s untimely death. Or that she even knew him. How could she explain she\u2019d been at his place, had managed to run away without being killed by his murderers, and had never told the police she had been there?</p><p>Every time there was a murder of one of the Mob in Mario\u2019s employ or related to him of late, she was involved! The word would leak to Mario and his henchmen that she might be a possible witness to the murder. And then they\u2019d want her eliminated even more than before.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cFerdinand always left me messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft you messages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my informant, telling me where Mario could be reached, hoping I\u2019d take him down because I was a bounty hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy was he informing on Mario for you? If his brother worked for Constantino, seems to me it was a good way to get his brother killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I suspected Ferdinand had his own vendetta.\u201d</p><p>The detective motioned to his partner and said, \u201cWe need to locate this Ferdinand Massaro, ASAP.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d The other detective left the apartment and began talking on his phone.</p><p>Alicia swallowed a lump in her throat. She didn\u2019t have any idea if Mario had disposed of Ferdinand\u2019s body or just left him dead in his condo. What if the police could tie her to the crime scene?</p><p>\u201cThe place looks clean, unless you tidied it up,\u201d Detective Hanover said to Alicia.</p><p>For a moment, she thought the detective was referring to Ferdinand\u2019s condo, then she realized he was talking about her apartment. Get a grip, Alicia!</p><p>\u201cIt was like this when we arrived,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cThen it appears Mario\u2019s henchman was only waiting here for you and wasn\u2019t searching for anything incriminating you might have had here. Or he was very neat when he went about his business.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, thinking the same thing, but why say one way or another when she truly didn\u2019t have an answer? Besides, she didn\u2019t want to give away the fact she had her mother\u2019s belongings, which she\u2019d be going through if the police would ever leave her alone.</p><p>Detective Hanover watched her for a long time before he finally said, \u201cAll right. Well, one other thing.\u201d</p><p>Something in the way he said \u201cone other thing\u201d made her think it was significant, although he tried to make it sound like an offhand last-minute question. She tried to not tense up while she waited for him to say what that one other thing was.</p><p>He tapped his pen on his notepad like Detective Simpson had done at Darien\u2019s house, and for an instant, she felt it was a training technique they all had learned in police detective school. A way to fluster the interviewee in a crime-scene investigation.</p><p>\u201cTwo 9-1-1 calls were made in Breckenridge, both about you,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>She stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>He paused, observed her reaction, and then forged ahead. \u201cThe first was nearly two months ago, coinciding with when you said you met Mr. Jake Silver.\u201d The detective read from his notebook, \u201cA handwritten death threat was left at the room of one Miss Alicia Greiston. Myron Baker, assistant manager of the Mountainview Inn, called to report that Alicia Greiston had hastily paid for her hotel room and left without sending word to Mr. Silver although they\u2019d had a prearranged engagement later that day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d Detective Hanover said, \u201cmy father happens to be the police chief in Breckenridge and led the investigation.\u201d</p><p>Police Chief Winston Hanover. Of course. She\u2019d met him when he was trying to solve her mother\u2019s murder several months earlier. Who would have thought his son would now be interrogating her in another incident?</p><p>\u201cMy father was unsuccessful in locating the missing woman, you, Miss Greiston. He assumed you had gone missing, not wanting to see Mr. Silver any further. Although my father was still concerned about your interest in Constantino, that the mobster has been spending time in the area, and that you believed there was a connection between the man and your mother\u2019s death, not to mention her lover\u2019s murder as well. None of which my father has been able to corroborate to date.\u201d</p> <p>Alicia barely breathed.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened, Miss Greiston? Why did you suddenly disappear from your hotel that day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe note containing the death threat explains it all. I feared for Jake\u2019s life and left before Mario killed him for hanging around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake assures me that Mario has no chance at doing him any harm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d the detective said. Then he flipped to another page in his notebook. \u201cThen a day or so ago, a 9-1-1 call was made from the Cliffside Art Gallery, and the woman frantically tells the operator that a woman is in trouble. Her name is, surprisingly... Alicia Greiston. But the woman quickly tells the operator it\u2019s a false alarm and the woman had passed out due to being pregnant. Since no real medical emergency existed, the operator concluded the conversation. But when my father heard of the call, his interest was instantly piqued. Now he knows the woman is still around, still alive, but he\u2019s disconcerted that he hadn\u2019t had a chance to talk to her... you.</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t end there. That night, another 9-1-1 call is made. A high-school buddy of mine gets the call about the shooting at Crestview Motel, and guess who\u2019s at the heart of the shooting? Why our elusive Miss Greiston. Of course, Detective Simpson didn\u2019t know you\u2019d gone missing in Breckenridge or been the subject of the call about a pregnancy mishap...\u201d The detective hesitated, and his gaze dropped to her waist.</p><p>She felt her face burn with embarrassment as she could imagine both Peter and Tom looking her over again, trying to figure if that was what all this was about. Had she\u2019d gotten pregnant with Jake\u2019s baby? But the timing wasn\u2019t right, as far her having been turned, if a werewolf couldn\u2019t impregnate a human.</p><p>\u201cAnd now this. It seems as though no matter where you are, trouble follows you. My boss says we need to put you in protective custody, considering who you\u2019re dealing with and how much my father would like to take Constantino down. But I wasn\u2019t sure which one of you he was concerned more about protecting, considering all these shooting incidents that have occurred. You, or the men who hassle you and keep ending up shot or dead.\u201d</p><p>And he didn\u2019t even know about the man she\u2019d shot on the trail where her mother had died.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine with Jake and his family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn truth, you\u2019re bound to put his whole family at risk. There\u2019s a good chance somebody\u2019s going to do something rash and someone you love is going to get blamed for it when they\u2019ve never done anything criminal in their life.\u201d Detective Hanover looked at Jake, as if to say he was the one the detective was talking about.</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll be careful. We\u2019re just picking up some of Alicia\u2019s things from her apartment and giving notice. She\u2019s permanently moving in with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need your address,\u201d Detective Hanover said. \u201cBut think about it. If you change your mind...\u201d He handed Alicia his business card. \u201cJust call me.\u201d</p><p>The other detective opened the front door of the apartment, and from the grim look on his face, he probably had learned Ferdinand Massaro was dead. \u201cCan I talk to you for a moment out here?\u201d he said to Detective Hanover, his gaze shifting to Alicia, then back to his partner.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t know she was involved in that murder, too, could they?</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The detective looked at Alicia as if he knew she had something to do with the latest report, which had her on edge all over again.</p><p>The two men left the apartment and shut the door, and the detective\u2019s partner began talking.</p><p>Alicia slumped against the couch, realizing just how tense she\u2019d been up until now. Jake wrapped his arm around her shoulders and gave her a comforting hug. But none of them spoke while she and the others all listened, trying to hear what was being said outside the apartment.</p> <p>Because of the large glass window and their enhanced wolf hearing, Alicia and the others heard the man say, \u201cI learned Ferdinand Massaro is dead. Found in his condo by his cleaning lady the next morning. He\u2019d been murdered the night before. A couple returning from a late-night movie saw a woman fitting Miss Alicia Greiston\u2019s description leaving the condo, frazzled and upset, sometime in the middle of the night. Several blocks from the condo, a cab driver gave a woman fitting Miss Greiston\u2019s description a ride to her car parked in a suburb on the other side of the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. Now why did I guess she might have been involved in another shooting incident that was connected with Mario\u2019s gang?\u201d Detective Hanover asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a shooting this time. Massaro\u2019s neck was broken. The coroner said it had to have been a man who killed him because of the trauma to his neck. But it only figures, Hanover. The little lady gets around. She sure has a hell of a lot more gumption than she appears to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good at staying alive, I\u2019ll give her that. Anything else you can give me before I go in and question her some more?\u201d</p><p>Alicia closed her eyes against the pounding headache developing in her temple.</p><p>Jake kissed her cheek. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat do I say now?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Round two, Jake glumly thought as he pulled away from Alicia and held her hand so she didn\u2019t look ready to collapse under pressure before Detective Hanover returned to her apartment to grill her further. When the detective and his partner returned to the interrogation, the other detective looked almost smug as he watched the proceeding. Alicia hadn\u2019t had time to prepare what she\u2019d say, nor had Jake had time to counsel her.</p><p>Tom and Peter attempted to look unconcerned, but Jake could tell both were worried. She\u2019d been at a murder scene and hadn\u2019t reported it. What was she going to say now? Jake was tempted to get one of their lawyers involved before this went any further, but the problem was that the murder had taken place in Denver. They needed a wolf lawyer there to defend her, if that\u2019s what it took. But they didn\u2019t know any werewolf packs in the city, since the packs usually avoided most bigger cities and stayed closer to home. Except for Sherry Slate. Jake didn\u2019t figure she\u2019d like it that he hadn\u2019t been interested in her beyond a couple of dates but now he\u2019d taken up with Alicia and wanted Sherry to defend her.</p><p>\u201cSo, Miss Greiston, do you want to tell me what happened on the night of July 15 when you visited Ferdinand Massaro at his condo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me to meet him at his place. That he had information about where to locate Mario. He left the message underneath my hotel-room door. When I went to his place, no one answered the door. I rang the doorbell several times, but still no answer. I didn\u2019t have his phone number, so I couldn\u2019t give him a call. I figured he\u2019d left. Or maybe I had the time or location wrong. Or he might have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you say he had left a message under your door. So you must have had the right information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so. But then I thought maybe I didn\u2019t. I hadn\u2019t brought the piece of paper with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still have it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI tossed it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you left the place in the middle of the night and...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally got a taxi and returned to where I\u2019d parked my car. Then I drove to my hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy get a taxi to get to your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was being cautious in case any of Mario\u2019s men might be following me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Detective Hanover said.</p><p>Jake knew she hadn\u2019t parked her car and taken a taxi from there, not when Massaro had grabbed her at the other location, but he couldn\u2019t tell if the detective knew that or not. He assumed the detective would make a note to check out the cab records to verify her claim and find nothing of the sort.</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d The detective looked up from his note-taking.</p><p>\u201cI moved from place to place, trying again to track down Constantino and Danny Massaro. When I finally found where they were, I notified the police and they picked them up.\u201d</p><p>Detective Hanover studied her for a moment, then quietly said, \u201cBut they didn\u2019t. Pick them up.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open, then she snapped it shut.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re free still?\u201d Jake asked, rubbing her hand and having assumed that was the case.</p><p>\u201cYes. The police arrived too late. But if you\u2019re a bounty hunter who\u2019s supposed to be bringing them in, why turn their location over to the police?\u201d Detective Hanover asked Alicia.</p><p>\u201cI figured they were too dangerous for me to try and arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you had witnessed Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>Jake could hear Alicia\u2019s rapid heartbeat. He felt her clammy hand in his and knew she was trying to make the best of this situation. He wished he could get her the hell out of this nightmare legally, without causing further stress or trouble for her.</p><p>\u201cMurdered?\u201d she asked, her voice hollow, and despite knowing Ferdinand had been murdered already, she sounded convincing enough that she hadn\u2019t already had a clue. \u201cThe... the night I went to see him?\u201d</p><p>Genuine tears filled her eyes. Jake knew they weren\u2019t faked. She must have been terrified to see what she had in the condo, further horrified that she could have ended up like Ferdinand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt fits you were there after he was murdered.\u201d</p><p>Not before, good. Or maybe the detective was giving her an out to see if she\u2019d let anything slip. If anyone had seen Ferdinand take Alicia into the condo after he\u2019d knocked her out, wouldn\u2019t they have reported it to the police? Maybe not, thinking she was dead drunk.</p><p>Hanover\u2019s partner got a call and said into his phone, \u201cThis is Brumley. Yeah?\u201d He looked up at Alicia. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll tell Hanover. Yeah, we\u2019re still questioning her. Thanks.\u201d He hung up his phone. \u201cWant me to ask?\u201d he questioned Hanover.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s about another shooting,\u201d Hanover said dryly.</p><p>Brumley said, \u201cYeah, it is. Seems some hikers thought they\u2019d heard a shot fired and then saw two men in suits coming off a hiking trail near Breckenridge, one with a bloodied trouser leg. The hikers said a woman was standing by a wreath of flowers near the trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Missy Greiston,\u201d Hanover guessed, looking directly at Alicia. \u201cSo who shot the man, Brumley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guess?\u201d his partner asked.</p><p>\u201cTake your best shot,\u201d Hanover said, never taking his eyes off Alicia.</p> <p>She remained ramrod stiff.</p><p>\u201cMario\u2019s men came after her on the trail, and met up with Alicia Greiston when she was visiting the spot where her mother had died. Mario\u2019s men threatened her. Miss Greiston defended herself. The men left but, in their usual fashion, didn\u2019t report the gunshot wound. Because of that, there was no crime to report. No real witnessing of a crime. Only circumstantial evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGun casings? Bullet fragments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Detective Hanover slapped his hands on his thighs, rose from the chair, and said, \u201cThat about wraps it up. If you think you might have seen someone or something in connection with Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s murder, you\u2019ll let us know, won\u2019t you, Miss Greiston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Alicia said softly.</p> <p>Detective Hanover gave his head a little shake and followed Brumley out the door. Once it was locked, Alicia let out a shaky breath, then looked at Tom and Peter\u2019s grave expressions.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t witness any other shootings or killings. I swear it,\u201d she said with a frown, her voice sharp.</p><p>They both chuckled darkly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go through my mother\u2019s things, then we can pack up some of my stuff and go. I did want to keep my furniture, though.\u201d She looked at the new couch and love seats she\u2019d bought the previous year and that she\u2019d saved hard-earned money to purchase. And she longed to sleep in her own bed, too.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. My grandparent\u2019s place has old furniture that needs replacing. We\u2019ll get a moving van and move your things there.\u201d Jake said to Tom and Peter, \u201cYou can wait here and make sure no one comes that shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to rent a moving van? Shouldn\u2019t take anything very big to haul Alicia\u2019s furniture and personal effects back to Silver Town,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Rising from the couch, Jake looked to Alicia for a decision. She nodded. She might as well get this over and done with. No sense in paying rent on a place when she wasn\u2019t going to be living there. \u201cI\u2019ll have to give notice, and I\u2019ll lose my deposit for not giving a month\u2019s notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter. I make enough money for the two of us.\u201d He took her hand and helped her up from the couch.</p> <p>She gave him an easy smile and looped her finger through one of his belt loops. \u201cI should have asked that right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that was the only thing holding you back from saying yes.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an annoyed look and a tug on his belt loop as she headed for the stairs. \u201cI don\u2019t recall being asked anything that remotely required me to say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to call Darien and give him the heads-up concerning our progress?\u201d Tom asked, cell phone in hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, tell him we\u2019re getting a moving van so it might take a little longer to return home. And you can let him know that we had the shooting incident here at her apartment and gave police statements again. Tell him there\u2019s a little trouble about Alicia\u2019s being sighted at the condo where Ferdinand Massaro died, in case we need to find a lawyer in Denver, and that we\u2019re about ready to go through Alicia\u2019s mother\u2019s things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>A little trouble? Witnessing a murder was bound to get her into a whole lot more trouble. Why had she ever mentioned knowing Ferdinand Massaro?</p><p>When they reached the bedroom, Jake moved into the closet to pull out the boxes of stuff belonging to Alicia\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cJust dump the contents on the floor, and we\u2019ll sort through them that way,\u201d she said, her heart in her throat. She\u2019d thrown everything in the boxes without really going through any of it, so she hadn\u2019t a clue if any of it needed to be discarded or not. But smelling her mother\u2019s perfume on her personal effects and seeing the jewelry and trinkets she\u2019d collected since her mother had been a young woman was still hard for Alicia to deal with.</p><p>After searching through two of the boxes of knickknacks that Alicia decided she couldn\u2019t part with, while she randomly wiped away her errant tears, Jake paused and asked, \u201cWhere do you keep your tissues?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedside table.\u201d</p><p>He returned to her side with the box, crouched in front of her, and wiped away her tears himself. \u201cAlicia, if this is too difficult for you...\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI might see something that would mean something to me but that wouldn\u2019t to you.\u201d She smiled through her tears at him and swept her hand down his arm until she was holding his strong but gentle hand, and she squeezed lightly in thanks. \u201cThanks, Jake. Have I told you I love you?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a quirky smile. \u201cNot in so many words, but I knew it anyway.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a watery smile, and he tilted her chin up and kissed her lips. But he quickly broke off the kiss, gave her a light hug, and then went back to searching through a sheaf of papers. She knew he wanted to get this over with, the sooner the better, and be on their way. She wished she could look through everything as clinically as he could.</p><p>She was leaning forward to move aside more papers when her hand brushed against something oddly familiar\u2014a small, sturdy red envelope that was big enough only for a key. She recognized the bank key at once, and her heart began beating faster. She lifted the envelope, shook out the key, and held it up to show Jake. \u201cMy mother\u2019s safe-deposit-box key.\u201d</p><p>Jake paused from reading through various papers he\u2019d found and looked up at her. \u201cWhere is the box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bank in Breckenridge. She... didn\u2019t want to keep it in Dillon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His dark brows were slightly furrowed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I never asked, and she never said.\u201d Alicia had never given it much thought, but as intensely as Jake was looking at her, she suspected he thought the key could be vital to discovering clues.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what it contains?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPersonal papers, I guess. She had me sign the signature card so I could have access if I ever needed to. I never did, and I have no idea what she kept in it. I always thought it was kind of odd that she\u2019d have it there instead of where she lived permanently. After her death, I didn\u2019t give it any thought. She never had anything of real value. Just fake jewels that she kept with her at home. So I figured she kept her birth certificate, Grandmother\u2019s death certificate, her social security card, stuff like that in there.\u201d</p><p>Alicia tried not to sound as anxious as he was making her feel, but she wanted to check out the bank vault that day. She knew they wouldn\u2019t have time. Not when they had to move all the furniture and her other household goods to Silver Town. The bank would be closed by the time they got to Breckenridge.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to check it out first thing tomorrow,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She\u2019d known that the minute she discovered the key in her mother\u2019s possessions. She tucked the key into her jeans pocket and then spied another key. This one looked like a house key, she thought. She sniffed it and frowned. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t my mother\u2019s. It smells faintly of cologne. The same smell I got a whiff of in Ferdinand\u2019s apartment when one of Mario\u2019s henchmen came looking for me. Danny Massaro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Jake asked, taking the key from her. He gave it a good whiff, memorizing the smell of it.</p><p>\u201cYes. Would a wolf\u2019s nose lie?\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand. \u201cNo. So it\u2019s Danny\u2019s key. Why would your mother have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. What if Tony had stolen it and given it to Mom to keep hidden in her stuff? Maybe it\u2019s Danny\u2019s house key, and Tony was trying to get some goods on the guy or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Jake said noncommittally, still looking through more of the stuff on the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything in these boxes.\u201d He looked up at her. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Well, I\u2019ll put everything away if you want to take your clothes out of the drawers and pack up your items in the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and looked around at her apartment. She had truly thought she\u2019d return to it someday. She never had expected to be a werewolf mated to another and leaving her apartment to live with him in another town.</p><p>She was still sitting on the floor when she noticed Jake wasn\u2019t putting things back into the boxes any longer. She turned to see what he was doing. He was watching her. \u201cAre you all right, Alicia?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll need some boxes for my clothes, though.\u201d</p><p>Before she could stand, he pulled her to her feet, and then he gave her a warm hug. \u201cI plan to settle into my grandfather\u2019s house tonight. Darien might say no, but if we can get a bodyguard detail together, that\u2019s where I\u2019d like to be with you tonight. In our own place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Although she didn\u2019t have a clue what his place looked like. What if she didn\u2019t like it?</p><p>She\u2019d love it, she decided. If Jake was with her and she could help him decorate, she\u2019d love it. \u201cAre your photographs hanging on the walls?\u201d she asked as she headed for her chest of drawers.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll leave the walls for you to decorate to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d He continued to reverently put her mother\u2019s things back in the boxes.</p> <p>\u201cI want that photograph of the fuchsia flowers at the gallery, unless you have another like that. Oh.\u201d She put an armload of sweaters on the bed. \u201cWhat about my car? Your photograph of the wood lilies is in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have any photograph you want, Alicia. You didn\u2019t need to buy any of them.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou might be my only buyer.\u201d Then he grew serious. \u201cBut your car will have been towed to a service station in Breckenridge. The window will be replaced and everything will be set right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I would have hated to lose that picture.\u201d</p><p>He was so quiet that Alicia looked over from unloading another drawer of her underwear. He was reading a note.</p><p>\u201cAnything important?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn address.\u201d He looked up at her. \u201cDanny Massaro\u2019s address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo my mother had Danny\u2019s key and\u201d\u2014she read the address\u2014\u201can address I don\u2019t recognize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe key could be to any place. But it really wouldn\u2019t matter. I have lock picks, remember?\u201d</p><p>Four hours later, they were finished unloading the furniture at Jake\u2019s grandfather\u2019s place, a spacious brick ranch-style home. Alicia wandered around the three-bedroom house, finally standing in the living room and turning to look at Jake as she watched men she hadn\u2019t met help settle her furniture in the place. The same men had already moved out his grandfather\u2019s old furniture and even cleaned up the house. Jake said he and Tom and some others had worked on renovating the place for months in preparation for moving in. She was already really warming up to being part of a pack.</p><p>\u201cIs the house to your liking?\u201d he asked, studying her response.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, Jake. All the beautiful stained-wood trim, the moldings, the rustic stone fireplace. I can\u2019t wait for winter to come when we can sit before the fireplace, sipping hot chocolate and watching the flames flicker.\u201d She looked out the expansive window at the forest surrounding them.</p> <p>\u201cAll my life I\u2019ve lived on top of people, crunched up beside people in apartments. Heard all the noise of neighbors walking on my ceiling or banging against walls when hanging pictures or moving furniture. Or hearing angry words when fights occurred. I love it here, the peace and quiet, the wide open space, yet the surrounding forest makes it comforting.\u201d</p><p>He joined her and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel isolated out here? Scared? Frightened of the woods? You\u2019ve lived all your life in town. You won\u2019t feel you\u2019ve been dumped in the wilderness, will you?\u201d</p><p>She nestled against his body. \u201cNo. I love it here. I used to love going on nature walks with my mother, wishing I had been a pioneer and could have lived out away from people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruthfully in a pack, we\u2019re never very isolated. We might have our own homes or apartments, but we\u2019re never really alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d she said, smiling up at him as she listened to the men moving the master-bedroom furniture around as Tom directed the placement of the dresser.</p><p>\u201cLelandi wants us to come home for dinner. If that\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d He leaned down and slanted his mouth over hers and then, with an openmouthed kiss, stroked her lips with his. When she parted her lips for him, he tongued hers. Their hearts were already beating faster, his body hardening, her nipples spearing him. \u201c...we\u2019ll set things up a bit before we return to their house.\u201d</p> <p>She knew what he had in mind. \u201cWill it be safe?\u201d</p><p>Already his eyes had darkened with desire. \u201cGuards will be posted outside the house. You\u2019ll be safe. I\u2019ll just talk to them. If you want to\u201d\u2014he waved at the hallway that led to the bedroom\u2014\u201cstart making the bed. I\u2019ll help you finish up in a minute.\u201d</p><p>The only thing bad about being with a pack was the knowledge they all knew exactly what she and Jake would be doing as soon as he cleared the house out. As soon as the men finished with the bedroom, she slipped into the room and dug around in a box, then found a set of fresh sheets as she listened to hear what Jake was telling the men. Not a word. Just a shuffling of boots, and the front door opened and everyone marched outside.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jake was stalking into the bedroom. \u201cI set a detail around the house. We\u2019ll be safe enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t mind?\u201d she asked, searching for the pillows.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. We\u2019d all do the same for each other. Why did you have such a big bed when you\u2019re such a little thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? I\u2019m a kangaroo in bed. You\u2019ll probably decide to sleep in one of the other bedrooms once we furnish them. Or on the couch.\u201d</p><p>With only the bottom sheet on the bed, he maneuvered her over to the mattress and began pulling up her shirt. \u201cThe couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in case I fight you too much at night.\u201d</p><p>His fingers pushed through her hair, and he cupped her head as he leaned down to kiss her mouth. \u201cYou won\u2019t move an inch when we\u2019re together, and we won\u2019t need but half that bed to sleep on.\u201d</p><p>A promise was a promise, and making love with Jake was only the beginning of fulfilling that promise. No matter how tender or rough or rushed or slow and measured his moves were, he was the perfect lover.</p><p>The bedroom was cluttered with packing boxes and the newly painted walls were bare. The bed had no other coverings but the one fitted bottom sheet\u2014silky cotton, no pillows, just she and Jake and their bared bodies as he pulled off her clothes and then his. She loved the way he wanted her, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of being with her. That she was beautiful and desirable, and she prayed he\u2019d always feel that way about her. As she prayed she\u2019d always feel that way about him.</p><p>He took his time pleasuring her, stroking her, making her wet and aching with need, only stopping to suckle a breast or kiss her mouth or slip his tongue between her parted lips, stirring her desire to have him deep inside her, thrusting and taking pleasure in her.</p><p>She slid her hands over his hard muscles, loving the feel of his smooth skin, the rough hair on his chest, his puckered, aroused nipples, his rigid sex rubbing against her in urgent desperation.</p><p>She wanted him. Needed him. Craved him.</p><p>He kissed her throat, trailing a hot, wet tongue down her breast, stopping briefly to lick her nipple, then down to her navel. He kissed and licked her there, sending her senses reeling in a whirling pool of desire. Her fingers combed through his thick hair, her body arching as the ache between her legs intensified.</p><p>And then he was stroking her most intimate spot, wringing her senses in the most erotic way. She fought crying out as her heated body rose, the wave building pleasure higher and higher. Like the rising crescendo from a well-orchestrated piece of heaven, she felt uplifted until the climax hit, pulsing through her and staggering in its pleasurable sensation. He was in her before she barely had begun to sink into that dreamy state of complete satisfaction, thrusting, massaging her breasts with loving tenderness, and kissing her lips with sizzling passion.</p><p>God, he was beautiful. She hadn\u2019t believed women could have orgasms. Jake proved she was wrong. Over and over again. Just his tongue simulating sex, the way he thrust it into her mouth, could give her a near orgasm. His body rubbing hers, his finger stroking her, his mouth teasing her nipples into submission. The way he moved into her brought her again to that higher plane of existence\u2014to that other world of blissful sexual fulfillment.</p><p>And when he came, she felt the trembling sweet exhilaration in joining with him again.</p><p>\u201cHmm, Alicia,\u201d Jake mouthed against her breast and then licked a nipple, lifting his head to study her with a contented smile on his face. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll call Darien and Lelandi and tell them we won\u2019t be going over there for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Alicia smiled and caressed his whiskery chin. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said, running his hand over her belly in a loving way. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll go without supper.\u201d</p><p>Supper consisted of homemade beef stroganoff and a glass of milk. And Alicia realized what a bargain she\u2019d gotten in Jake when she\u2019d mated with a wolf who could cook gourmet-style meals. Then it was back to bed, and sleep would come next as Jake fulfilled the first of his promises. They\u2019d only use half the bed as he tucked her into his arms and held on tight, and he wasn\u2019t sleeping on any couch, ever.</p><p>Early the next morning, they left for Breckenridge to check out her mother\u2019s safe-deposit box. Alicia hadn\u2019t thought they would need all that much firepower, but Darien wasn\u2019t taking any chances and several of the men in his pack had volunteered.</p><p>Darien was staying close to Lelandi at home in case she had the triplets early, but Jake and his brother, Tom, accompanied Alicia, along with Peter and a half dozen other men from the pack.</p><p>At least she felt safe. She was nervous about what might be in her mother\u2019s safe-deposit box, though. As she rode up to the bank in a black Suburban, with another leading the way, she felt like she was a member of an FBI team on a SWAT mission. That was much different from driving around in her little red Neon when she was about to serve a warrant.</p><p>Going to the bank should have been a private affair, with Jake at her side and her bodyguard force tagging along. But after all the incidents in the past\u2014her mother\u2019s murder, the shooting on the trail, her own planned disappearance, and her false-pregnancy faux-fainting episode at the art gallery, she feared that Detective Hanover\u2019s father, the chief of police of Breckenridge, might get wind of her reappearance and send a patrolman to question her. What if the word had gone out to be on the lookout for her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s the way she felt as she entered the bank. The three tellers turned to look at her, smiles disappearing to be replaced by looks of surprise. And two of the loan officers\u2019 expressions mirrored theirs. But then again, maybe it was because of the handsome men Alicia had accompanying her. Not often did one enter a bank with an entourage of wolfish-looking guys.</p><p>In that instant, Alicia felt incredibly lucky. The other men made sure she was safe inside, then headed back outside to guard the entrance. Jake stuck by her side, while Tom and Peter stood by the door watching them.</p><p>She hoped that from the concerned looks on the staff\u2019s faces, they didn\u2019t think she and the men intended to rob the bank. She and Jake approached the woman in charge of the vault. The woman led the way, then unlocked and pulled the safe-deposit box out for them. After asking Alicia to sign the register, she left them alone.</p> <p>Alicia lifted the lid of the steel box with trepidation, while Jake looked on as if she were opening a treasure box or a booby-trapped mine. On top of a stack of papers was her mother\u2019s lease agreement to her apartment, but off to one corner, a ring glittered, catching Alicia\u2019s eye. She pulled it out from under the papers and stared at the carat diamond surrounded by smaller diamonds. Had her father given this to her mother? If he\u2019d cared enough to give her this nice of a ring, why had he left her?</p><p>Jake watched but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>She moved aside more papers and found a little black book. Inside were tons of dates and figures and initials, but none of it made any sense.</p><p>\u201cLooks like some kind of code,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cBut what would my mother be doing with something like this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t hers.\u201d</p><p>Alicia looked up at Jake. \u201cTony\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight have been his.\u201d</p><p>Alicia glanced back at the ring, wondering about her father, wondering if what her mother had told her had really been true. She opened an official-looking envelope. Inside was her mother\u2019s birth certificate. She slipped it back in the envelope and opened another. Alicia\u2019s birth certificate. She wasn\u2019t going to look at it closely, figuring it was a copy of the one she had at home, until her hand brushed over the embossed seal.</p><p>She opened it, wondering why her mother would have had two original embossed copies, and scanned the information. Birth date, time of birth, Alicia\u2019s name, her mother\u2019s... all correct. But when she looked at the father\u2019s name\u2014Antonio Frasero, she realized it wasn\u2019t a name she\u2019d ever seen before. She felt incredibly light-headed all at once.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Jake asked, seeing her distress.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t my birth certificate.\u201d She ran her finger over the embossed seal. \u201cEither that, or the one I had at my apartment was forged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take it with us, and we\u2019ll check it out. What\u2019s different about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Jake looked troubled. \u201cWhat do you know about your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just that he left us when I was two. No reason. Just left. That\u2019s what my mother always told me. When I asked her, she didn\u2019t want to talk about him. She would just wave away my question, but she\u2019d become teary eyed, and no matter how long it had been, I could tell she still loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut to your knowledge, he never returned?\u201d</p><p>She stared at Jake, then closed her gaping mouth and shook her head. She sifted through more of the papers. Nothing. She\u2019d half-expected to find divorce papers, a custody agreement for visitation rights, parental financial support, sole support, something, but no sign of...</p><p>She paused when she unfolded the last document and quit breathing.</p> <p>Her mother\u2019s marriage certificate to one Antonio Frasero.</p><p>The same name on Alicia\u2019s birth certificate in the safe-deposit box. Antonio... Tony? The man who\u2019d been her mother\u2019s lover? And subsequently had been murdered near Continental Falls by Danny Massaro? Had Tony been her father? But he had to have had an alias then. Tony Thomas. Not Antonio Frasero. And he\u2019d been murdered. Like her mother.</p><p>\u201cAlicia!\u201d Jake called as her face turned as white as the tile floor, and she crumpled in his arms. If he hadn\u2019t seen the stricken look on her face, he probably wouldn\u2019t have caught her in time.</p><p>Hearing his shout, the bank clerk hurried into the cage, along with Tom and Peter. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d the bank clerk asked horrified.</p><p>\u201cOvercome with grief,\u201d Jake said, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course.\u201d The clerk\u2019s cheeks grew pink with embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d Jake said, \u201choney...\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when a police officer poked his head into the room. \u201cCan I help... what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fainted,\u201d Jake said, exasperated that everyone was crowding him in the small bank vault.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant,\u201d the police officer said, nodding. \u201cThat\u2019s what the 9-1-1 call was about from Cliffside Art Gallery. The chief is on his way. Does she need medical assistance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chief?\u201d Jake asked. What the hell was that all about?</p><p>\u201cYes, the police chief. He\u2019s been wanting to ask the young lady some questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her to our staff lounge, if you would, sir. We have a couch she can lie down on until she feels better,\u201d the clerk said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tom asked for Jake\u2019s ears only.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Jake assured him, not wanting to discuss what was the matter in front of all the others.</p><p>But Tom looked as though he didn\u2019t believe Alicia would be all right. And Jake wasn\u2019t sure he believed it, either. Now he wondered if she had actually fainted in the restroom at the art gallery and had only said she\u2019d turned into the wolf.</p><p>\u201cIs she pregnant?\u201d Tom asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cI think she had some disturbing news.\u201d Jake gave Tom a quelling look as the police officer followed them into the lounge, talking to someone on his phone. Jake didn\u2019t want any of this to become common knowledge until they could sort out the details.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s at the bank, just like Suzie said she was. But she\u2019s fainted again,\u201d the police officer said.</p><p>Jake lay Alicia down on the couch as she stirred and opened her eyes, her lips parting in surprise. Not only were Jake and his brother and Peter watching her as Jake crouched next to her, pushing her hair from her face, but three clerks, the police officer, and a couple of suited men also were hovering nearby.</p><p>Jake squeezed her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>Forget the over-the-counter pregnancy test. As soon as they returned to Silver Town, he was having Doc Weber examine her in the event she was pregnant and that could be what had affected her. He wanted to make sure she was truly all right.</p><p>The police chief strode into the room, brows raised to see Alicia sitting up on the sofa, despite Jake wanting her to lie still longer. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Really,\u201d she said, her eyes growing big as she looked beyond him at the police chief and police officer in attendance.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t look like she was fine at all. Her face was still deathly pale.</p><p>\u201cThe Denver police want to speak with you, Miss Greiston,\u201d the police chief said, as he drew closer and peered down at her through silver-rimmed glasses. He looked similar to his son, Detective Hanover, who had questioned her the day before at her apartment, but he was about sixty, with graying hair, and had an aged appearance that made him appear like a kindly grandfather type. At least toward Alicia.</p><p>Jake suspected the chief\u2019s demeanor had to do with his worry that Alicia was pregnant and was sick because of it. Chief Hanover looked like he could be as tough as granite if he wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cThe police,\u201d she parroted wearily.</p><p>At this rate, she was going to be talking to police all over the state of Colorado.</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Greiston. My son told me you were at the scene of Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s murder. The Denver police will want the details. But I have a couple of questions for you also. Since you\u2019re looking a little peaked, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll just ask you here. If everyone will clear out.\u201d He directed the comment to the bank staff.</p><p>The men and women agreeably and quickly filed out of the staff lounge.</p><p>The chief glanced at Tom and Peter, but Alicia said, \u201cI\u2019d prefer to have Jake and his brother, Tom, and Peter, our sheriff at Silver Town, stay, if it\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly.\u201d The chief sat down in a chair and said, \u201cMy son tells me he talked to you about the shooting at Spruce Creek Trail. Can you tell me what happened exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t have anything else to say. I left a wreath of flowers for my mother like I do once a week. I assumed the two men who approached me were Mario\u2019s men, and they asked me to go with them. I refused. Then they left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey left,\u201d the chief said, \u201cafter you shot one of the men.\u201d</p><p>She said nothing, her jaw and fingers clenching, but waited for him to speak further.</p><p>He cleared his throat and continued. \u201cWitnesses said they heard gunfire and saw one of the men with a bloody leg limping back to his car, cursing up a storm.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything for a minute, and Jake was glad she didn\u2019t offer any other explanation for what might have occurred. Finally she said, \u201cDid the man seek medical attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that we could learn of. But if they were who we think they were, they would have seen someone who would doctor him without reporting the shooting incident to the police.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything further, but her unspoken expression said volumes as she lifted her eyebrows slightly in a way that meant the chief could prove nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on your side in this,\u201d the chief finally said, sounding resigned. \u201cIf I could put Mario away for life, I\u2019d do it. But I don\u2019t want you getting yourself killed in the process, young lady. Nor do I want you to get into trouble for doing something illegal.\u201d He shoved his hands in his pockets and looked down at the floor as if he were trying to decide whether to say anything further, but he hesitated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He finally let out his breath, fixed her with his gaze, and said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be saying this, but the police in Denver have evidence you were in Massaro\u2019s apartment. Just a heads-up, when you speak with them.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip dropped, then she quickly clamped her mouth shut and swallowed hard.</p><p>Hell.</p> <p>\u201cWhat evidence?\u201d she finally asked, sounding more timid than Jake liked to hear.</p><p>\u201cYour driver\u2019s license was found inside Massaro\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted.</p><p>Jake stifled a curse. He was dying to know where they had found her driver\u2019s license. He wondered if Detective Hanover, the chief\u2019s son, had known this when he had asked her for her driver\u2019s license, testing her to see if she knew it was missing. If so, what had he concluded? She wasn\u2019t guilty of a crime? Massaro had stolen it from her? Or she\u2019d left it there by accident when she was fleeing the crime scene?</p><p>But then Jake was certain the detective would have been asking himself why Massaro would have taken her driver\u2019s license and nothing else. However, just because her driver\u2019s license was found in the condo, that didn\u2019t confirm she\u2019d been there. He could have stolen it. Although why that and nothing else?</p> <p>\u201cWhen did he get it from you, Miss Greiston?\u201d the chief asked.</p><p>So that was the crux of the matter. If she hadn\u2019t actually seen him, hadn\u2019t been able to enter the condo to speak with him because he was already dead, how did he manage to get hold of her driver\u2019s license?</p><p>\u201cWhere did the police find it?\u201d she asked, her voice dry.</p><p>The chief tapped one boot on the tile floor. \u201cThe Denver police wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re done with Alicia...\u201d Jake let his words trail off, not wanting her to be subjected to any more of an interrogation when the chief had no business asking her questions concerning the crime scene in Denver.</p><p>The chief straightened a bit and looked sympathetic. \u201cThey found blood on the sheets, Miss Greiston. And in a couple of other unspecified locations. I\u2019m sure the Denver police will want to take a sample of your blood. Did he hurt you?\u201d</p> <p>Alicia had to have bled when the bastard Massaro bit her, Jake suspected. Hell. The only good thing in the whole matter was that forensics couldn\u2019t determine her werewolf changes. But poor Alicia. Her face took on a whole new shade of white.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d Jake asked the chief, as he leaned in to help Alicia up from the couch. \u201cWe\u2019ll be headed back to Silver Town. If you have any further questions...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey found your fingerprints on the inside front doorknob, so they know you\u2019d been in the condo,\u201d the chief said to Alicia and added with a nod to Jake, \u201cMy son gave me the information of where she\u2019ll be staying. Thanks. And good luck, Miss Greiston. We want to solve your mother\u2019s murder as quickly as you do. Let us know if you learn anything further, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She halfheartedly nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then we\u2019ll be seeing you.\u201d</p><p>Jake wrapped his arm around Alicia\u2019s waist and helped her out of the bank and to the vehicle while Tom and Peter followed, and their guard detail reloaded into the SUVs.</p><p>\u201cDrive, will you, Tom?\u201d Jake asked, his voice terse as he pondered what they were going to do about the Denver police.</p><p>Chapter 18</p> <p>Jake helped Alicia into the backseat and went around the vehicle to join her while Tom settled into the driver\u2019s seat and Peter rode in the passenger\u2019s seat. Their guard force led the way again. Jake hoped to assuage her concerns at once. Although the problem of her connection to Massaro\u2019s murder wasn\u2019t going to be easy to explain to the police.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jake,\u201d Alicia said on a moan, as soon as he shut his door, \u201cthe Denver police will learn what I am as soon as they analyze the bloodstains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t concern yourself.\u201d He took her in his arms as Tom drove back to Silver Town. \u201cOur werewolf genetics are such that as humans we have only human DNA. As wolves, only wolf DNA. Now, if they found both, blood from when you were a wolf and from when you were human, it\u2019d make them believe a wolf and a human were in the room.\u201d</p><p>She melted against his chest and sighed heavily. \u201cThen if they do discover wolf\u2019s blood in the condo, they\u2019ll assume I lied about having a wolf at the Crestview Motel. I\u2019m just getting myself deeper and deeper into this. And dragging your family into the whole mess. Before long, don\u2019t you think they\u2019ll get a warrant to search your place to see if I\u2019m hiding a wolf there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t find any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I shift? I thought I was controlling it, but anytime now I could just, poof, turn into a wolf. And if I do it in front of a bunch of police officers\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it, Alicia. You\u2019re one of us, part of a pack. We\u2019ll take care of this in any way that we have to.\u201d</p><p>Tom said, \u201cYou want me to take her home.\u201d But the tone of his voice was more of a question\u2014did Jake want to take her to see Doc Weber instead?</p><p>Of course the doc made house calls when necessary, but in Alicia\u2019s case, Jake assumed he\u2019d need blood work, a urine sample, and a proper physical exam to tell if she was pregnant and make sure she and the baby would be all right. At least he thought that\u2019s what was needed. He was certain that if he proposed it in front of Alicia with Tom and Peter listening in, she\u2019d be upset with him. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t want to take her to the hospital under false pretenses.</p><p>\u201cThe hospital, Tom.\u201d</p><p>Alicia tried to pull away from Jake, her spine stiff, her whole body posture saying she was mad at him for even suggesting such a thing, but he held on tight, forcing her to remain in his arms until he felt the tension drain from her. She relaxed again, but not of her own accord, he felt. Rather, she just wasn\u2019t feeling up to fighting him.</p><p>He kissed the top of her head and enjoyed the feel of her soft supple curves, her feminine fragrance, and her thick silky hair beneath his cheek. He wanted to give her a life free of worry by sequestering her from the interrogations, taking care of Mario and his bastards, and showing Alicia the way of their people until she felt comfortable being one of them.</p><p>But now they had a new dilemma. Who was Alicia\u2019s father? And why had he and Alicia\u2019s mother died?</p><p>Jake expected Alicia to say something about the visit to the hospital, but she didn\u2019t voice a word. He felt guilty for forcing this on her, but they had to know. If she was pregnant, she needed to be seeing the doctor anyway.</p><p>\u201cCall ahead to the hospital, will you, Peter, and make an appointment?\u201d Jake said to the sheriff. He didn\u2019t want to let go of Alicia for a second to try and fish his phone out when she seemed content enough to relax in his arms.</p><p>Peter opened his cell phone and said, \u201cBethany, we need an appointment with Doc Weber scheduled for\u201d\u2014he glanced at the clock in the car\u2014\u201ctwo hours and fifteen minutes from now. Yeah, it\u2019s important. For Jake\u2019s mate, Alicia Greiston.\u201d He paused, cleared his throat, and then said, \u201cPossible pregnancy.\u201d He spoke as softly as he could so that Bethany could still hear him, but not softly enough that Jake and Alicia couldn\u2019t, what with their wolf\u2019s hearing. Although Jake gave him credit for making the effort. \u201cThanks. We\u2019ll be there then,\u201d Peter said, and put his phone away.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get married,\u201d Alicia grumbled against Jake\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019m not going to keep telling people I\u2019m engaged to you. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say I\u2019d want to again, not until you walked into my life and became my knight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t wear jewelry. So wedding rings are out.\u201d Jake tried his damnedest to be consoling, but this was probably one of the hardest things for newbie lupus garous to get a handle on. \u201cWe don\u2019t need rings to stay faithful. But even so, it would be especially difficult for you to wear any jewelry because you don\u2019t have the shifting under control. Trying to remove rings or necklaces and bracelets in the process of a shift could prove disastrous. As for marriage, we\u2019re mated. That means more than a marriage certificate. It means we commit to one another for life.\u201d</p><p>She frowned up at him. \u201cIf I am pregnant, I want to be officially married. With the paper to prove it. Blame it on my human upbringing.\u201d</p><p>He looked down into her dark chocolate eyes and thought of how addicted he was to looking at her, to feeling her close, to being with her. He would be with her always. He wished she could understand that. \u201cWe don\u2019t marry because we make a commitment...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI... want... to... be... married. I understand, or at least think I understand, how you commit for life without the need for a witnessed document. But I never knew who my father was and never knew if my parents had really been married. I want our baby to have the security of knowing we\u2019re formally committed.\u201d</p><p>He really wished they could have this discussion in private. He could just imagine what his brother and Peter were thinking. They were probably glad neither of them was trying to deal with an unreasonable newly turned wolf. He realized then her feelings might have something to do with her father, though\u2014the fake birth certificate and not knowing what was going on with him. Her father\u2019s abandonment of her and her mother, and then the mystery that surrounded her mother and father reuniting without letting Alicia know. Maybe, beyond all that, she was concerned Jake wouldn\u2019t live up to his promise to be the baby\u2019s father if she was pregnant.</p><p>\u201cAny baby you have will be mine and yours, Alicia. And he or she will be raised as a werewolf, knowing how we live our lives and that a formal marriage isn\u2019t part of the equation. You don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>She let out her breath in an exasperated manner. \u201cYou\u2019re a man,\u201d she said sourly.</p><p>He wanted to tell her he wouldn\u2019t be like her father had been to her mother. But he didn\u2019t think she would believe him, even if he tried to convince her. All he could do was prove he\u2019d stick by her side forever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her cheek and stroked her shoulder. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want me to be anything but.\u201d He let out a heavy sigh. Hell, he was an alpha male and his mate was already dictating to him. If word got out, he\u2019d never live it down. But he wanted her to be happy. Whatever it took. \u201cAll right. The judge can marry us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said grumpily, then gave him a smidgen of a smile.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her, giving her a somber smile back and loving her all the more. She hadn\u2019t had a family to call her own. He and his family would be there for her in any way that she needed, even if they had to bend or break a few golden werewolf rules in the process. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p> <p>Never in a million years would he have thought he\u2019d be the only one in the family or the pack ever forced to get a marriage license. Then again, he could just get the judge to sign off on one. No need to go through any kind of ceremony, even if he knew it would just be in the judge\u2019s chambers. All she had to want was the paper proving they were man and wife.</p><p>The whole notion grated on him, no matter that he tried to think of it as important to her and meaningless to him. He squeezed her tighter against his body. Well, not so meaningless to him because it meant so much to Alicia. And her happiness was paramount to him.</p><p>When they arrived at the hospital in Silver Town, everyone on staff looked Alicia over curiously, and she avoided their inquisitive gazes. Doc Weber dismissed Jake, even though he wanted to be with her in the room. Instead, he was left to pace in the staff lounge.</p><p>Peter and Tom stayed with him while Tom broached the subject of Alicia\u2019s fainting at the bank. \u201cYou said she got some upsetting news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to learn everything we can about an Antonio Frasero.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on it,\u201d Peter said. \u201cHow does she know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s her father. And it appears he may be the one who Constantino had killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know what I find out.\u201d Peter hurried out of the lounge, looking like a man with a mission.</p><p>Tom studied Jake. \u201cThe name Antonio Frasero sounds Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it sounds that way.\u201d Jake glanced back at the doorway to the lounge, wondering what was taking Doc so long in determining if Alicia was pregnant or not.</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s pregnant, is it Massaro\u2019s baby?\u201d Tom asked.</p> <p>\u201cMost likely,\u201d Jake said, trying to keep his voice even.</p><p>Tom nodded.</p><p>Then Doc poked his head in through the doorway. \u201cLooks like the lupus garou population of Silver Town is going to increase by another three early next year. I understand Silva\u2019s struggling to knit a pair of booties for the first of Lelandi\u2019s triplets. She\u2019s going to have a lot of practice in the next few months.\u201d</p><p>Jake couldn\u2019t say anything. The first thought he had was that Alicia\u2019s babies were his. He was a triplet. Darien was having triplets, although Lelandi had been a triplet also, whereas Alicia had been an only child. But still, what were the chances that they were Massaro\u2019s?</p><p>Tom looked just as stunned.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Doc. Thanks,\u201d Jake finally managed to get out.</p><p>Doc smiled. \u201cShe\u2019s worried they\u2019re not yours. But I have the sneaking suspicion they are. If I were you, I\u2019d check out the guy who turned her. She said he had been murdered. The police would have done an autopsy, and if he\u2019d had sex with a woman sometime before he was murdered\u2014which would have been the case if he\u2019d raped her from the timeline she gave me\u2014the doctor who examined the body would have learned of it. Alicia said he\u2019s the only one who could have made her pregnant. But we all know there are exceptions to every rule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be mine, no matter what, Doc,\u201d Jake said firmly.</p> <p>\u201cI understand. I\u2019ve prescribed some vitamin pills for her. Just make sure she gets plenty of rest and plenty of nutritious foods to eat. Otherwise, she\u2019s healthy and the babies will be fine. I\u2019ve got other patients to see, but...\u201d Doc uncharacteristically slapped Jake on the shoulder, smiling broadly. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your hands full.\u201d Then he headed out of the lounge.</p><p>Tom looked like he was dying to leave the staff lounge. He wasn\u2019t the town gossip, like Silva was, so Jake wasn\u2019t sure what was eating at him. Tom finally said, \u201cI\u2019m looking into this Ferdinand Massaro.\u201d</p><p>Jake took a deep breath. His brother wanted to know the truth of the matter as much as he did. \u201cPeter probably can get further with questioning the police than we can since he\u2019s a member of law enforcement. Have him check to see if in the autopsy that was done on\u2014\u201d Jake paused when he heard footfalls approach the room.</p><p>Alicia peered into the lounge, then seeing Jake and Tom alone, she joined them. \u201cI heard your voice,\u201d she said, as if she was afraid they\u2019d think she\u2019d been eavesdropping.</p><p>Jake hurried to take her arm, alarmed that she still appeared pale and unwell. \u201cYou still look peaked, Alicia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeep down I expected to be pregnant. But I never thought I\u2019d have a whole family in one fell swoop.\u201d Her teary eyes studied his. \u201cDoc said because they\u2019re triplets, they\u2019re probably yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he told me, too.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep, steadying breath. \u201cBut if they\u2019re not...\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his embrace. \u201cWe\u2019ll have three lovely girls to adore.\u201d</p><p>Tom gave a small smile as if to say that was wishful thinking and headed out of the room. He hoped Tom would tell Peter to see if an autopsy on Massaro revealed he\u2019d had sex with a woman before he died.</p><p>If Massaro hadn\u2019t, Jake would rethink the story Lelandi\u2019s brother, Leidolf, had told them about the woman who was the product of her human grandmother and a werewolf\u2019s intimate liaison.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to Darien\u2019s place,\u201d Jake said, but more than ever, he wanted a whole lot of answers to lots of new questions.</p><p>Standing in his living room and staring out his window at the brick wall surrounding his back courtyard, Mario listened on the phone as Danny ranted, \u201cSomeone was here... in my place. Looking through stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, all right? I leave things around, just in case. But the house wasn\u2019t broken into. Nothing taken as far as I can tell. But things aren\u2019t... the same.\u201d</p><p>Mario shook his head. Danny was becoming obsessed with being watched. \u201cHow aren\u2019t they the same?\u201d he asked, trying to hide his exasperation with his cousin.</p><p>\u201cI... I leave pieces of hair glued with saliva across my desk drawers. The hairs were broken or no longer there.\u201d</p><p>Hair? Saliva?</p><p>Mario shook his head. \u201cAre you sure they didn\u2019t just drop on the floor? Fall off? That you opened the drawers and forgot to replace the hairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I check them every time I get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have anything important in the drawers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Mario let out his breath. \u201cThen no problem.\u201d He figured Danny was just being paranoid. That nothing had truly happened.</p><p>\u201cI found a bug in my phone.\u201d</p><p>His face heating, Mario said slowly, \u201cWhich phone?\u201d It had better not be the one Danny was talking on now. Or if it was, he\u2019d better have gotten rid of the bug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gone,\u201d Danny said, reassuring him. \u201cBut the Feds have been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did they find out about your place?\u201d</p><p>Danny didn\u2019t speak for a while, then said, \u201cHell, I don\u2019t know. Cicero said something about Tony getting my key and making a copy of it. But I didn\u2019t believe it. And anyway, even if Tony did get a copy of my house key, he wouldn\u2019t have known where my house was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me Tony had gotten a copy of your key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed the locks. The key wouldn\u2019t have worked even if he had found the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have told me Tony got a copy of the key to your house, Danny. What were you thinking?\u201d Mario watched the oak tree\u2019s leaves flutter in the dry breeze. \u201cAll right. So you didn\u2019t have anything in the place that could cause any problems. Right?\u201d</p><p>Danny didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cRight, Danny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gun I used to whack Missy Greiston and Tony? It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>When Jake, Alicia, Tom, and Peter arrived at Darien\u2019s house, Lelandi greeted them looking so anxious that Jake was afraid something more was wrong.</p><p>But Lelandi quickly asked Alicia, \u201cAre you all right? Peter said you fainted at the bank.\u201d</p><p>Jake was glad that was all that was the matter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Alicia explained the situation about her father and the birth certificates, but although Lelandi listened, Jake could tell that wasn\u2019t what was concerning her.</p><p>\u201cYou look awfully pale,\u201d Lelandi said, and Jake suspected she knew Alicia was pregnant but was trying to prompt her to tell without being asked.</p><p>\u201cJake and I are going to get married,\u201d Alicia said, taking hold of Jake\u2019s hand and pulling him closer. \u201cRight away. We\u2019ll get the justice of the peace to do it.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi\u2019s lips parted, but she didn\u2019t say a word, her gaze quickly shifting to Jake.</p><p>Jake tried not to react in any way, yet he tensed. He couldn\u2019t help it. His kind just didn\u2019t get married. And he didn\u2019t like the inference that he couldn\u2019t be faithful without a marriage license, although he had to remind himself that probably wasn\u2019t bothering Alicia as much as having a name for the babies. He planned for Alicia to be a Silver anyway. Once she was one of the Silvers, no one would question her about getting a new driver\u2019s license or anything else she might need in her life.</p><p>\u201cMarriage? By the judge? No way,\u201d Lelandi said, her red brows furrowed.</p><p>Jake wasn\u2019t entirely surprised by her reaction. But he would marry Alicia in the judge\u2019s chambers, no matter what Lelandi or his brother said about it, since that\u2019s what Alicia felt she needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut Jake said he would. And I won\u2019t feel right until it\u2019s done,\u201d Alicia insisted, determination in her voice.</p><p>Jake wrapped his arm around her shoulder, but before he could defend their decision, Lelandi raised her brows at Jake, smiled, and patted Alicia on the shoulder. \u201cWhat I meant to say is that if we\u2019re going to go against tradition, we\u2019re going to do this right. We\u2019ll have a proper wedding.\u201d</p><p>Proper wedding?</p> <p>Jake groaned before he could catch himself. Tom chuckled. Peter grinned but wisely didn\u2019t say anything. Even Alicia didn\u2019t look pleased with the notion.</p><p>\u201cFirst, we need to get you a wedding dress. You\u2019ve been married before, so a cream-colored dress would probably be better. Although, what the heck, since we don\u2019t do weddings, you can wear whatever your heart desires. No sense in sticking to a tradition we don\u2019t even have.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi took Alicia\u2019s arm and pulled her away from Jake and headed for the sunroom. \u201cWe do have a bridal shop for the humans in town. And the owner is a wolf, of course. She will be ecstatic to be our consultant. Her shop also carries formals for special occasions and Victorian ball gowns for our Victorian festival. The men rarely dress up except for that, so this will be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to go through a whole lot of pomp and ceremony,\u201d Alicia said. \u201cI just wanted to make sure we had a marriage license. And I have been married twice already so it\u2019s not like I feel the need to go through any kind of ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. It\u2019ll be fun. Silva and I can help you decide about the festivities afterward. Darien can give you away. We\u2019ll have a ball.\u201d</p> <p>Jake felt for Alicia. She clearly didn\u2019t want to go this far.</p><p>Tom shook his head at Jake, his mouth curving in a small smile. \u201cDarien will love to hear he\u2019s been volunteered to serve as the bride\u2019s father in a wedding when we\u2019ve never taken part in one before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain Alicia\u2019s any more excited about it than I am.\u201d Jake glanced at Peter, expecting news about the calls he made earlier.</p><p>\u201cI called about the autopsy. The report on Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s body showed no signs that he\u2019d had intercourse prior to his death,\u201d Peter said. \u201cIn other words, he couldn\u2019t have raped Alicia shortly before he died.\u201d</p><p>Jake felt a little light-headed and sat down on one of the couches.</p><p>\u201cThe triplets are yours,\u201d Tom said, smiling. \u201cWho would have thought you\u2019d find your mate before me, as picky as you\u2019ve always been. And now you have a whole family on its way in record time. You\u2019re the first one to have a wedding, too. I mean, for any members of the pack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re mine,\u201d Jake said softly, still not believing it. He glanced up at Peter, who was smiling at him, too. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely sure?\u201d</p><p>Peter spread his hands in a way that said there was no other possibility.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get cribs and all that stuff. Everything that Lelandi\u2019s been stocking up for her babies when they\u2019re born.\u201d Jake had thought all her purchases and the way she\u2019d been stressing over the upcoming event had been unnecessary. That half of the stuff she\u2019d bought was not even needed.</p><p>But now he was rethinking his position. Now when he had his own triplets on the way. He rose to his feet, wondering why he was sitting around when he had so much to do.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be here for several months. You\u2019ll have time,\u201d Tom said, looking immensely amused. \u201cMy advice to you though is, don\u2019t make the nursery pink just yet.\u201d</p><p>Jake dragged his fingers through his hair, ignoring his brother\u2019s teasing, and then took a deep, steadying breath. Hell, now he had to get married. In a real wedding, of all things.</p><p>Peter said, \u201cThe other news is that I had some men check out Danny\u2019s place. You should have seen the way he rigged up the place. Strands of hair stuck to drawers in the event anyone opened them.\u201d</p><p>The guy was nuts.</p> <p>\u201cWe replaced them, though. Found a gun in a desk drawer and some papers having to do with racketeering that we sent to the Feds\u2014in a surreptitious way. They\u2019ll probably get a search warrant and nail the bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a wolf?\u201d Jake asked, surprised. If Ferdinand Massaro had been and Mario might be, he\u2019d thought for sure Danny was. But Peter wouldn\u2019t have sent the Feds incriminating evidence if Danny had been a wolf.</p><p>\u201cNope. And no wolves had been in the house. So unless someone changes the equation, Danny\u2019s free to go to prison\u2014for as long as he should live.\u201d</p><p>Darien entered the house with his cell phone to his ear, his expression grim and his brows raised as he acknowledged Jake, Tom, and Peter. Jake had the sneaking suspicion that more bad news was on its way.</p><p>Darien signed off with whomever he was talking to on the phone. \u201cThe police in Denver want to speak with Alicia about Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s murder again. They believe she witnessed the murder and want to put her in the Witness Protection Program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>Darien sighed. \u201cI know that, Jake. But you, Tom, and Peter will have to accompany her to Denver. Along with some men for backup guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she shape-shifts?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cJust pray she doesn\u2019t,\u201d Darien said, glancing in the direction of the sunroom, undoubtedly hearing some of Lelandi\u2019s conversation and probably wondering what that was all about.</p><p>Lelandi must have been talking on the phone as she said, \u201cOh, yes, a real wedding. What do you think for bridesmaids\u2019 gowns, Silva? Alicia says she wants you to take part, too, and wanted your opinion.\u201d</p><p>Darien gave Jake a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married.\u201d Jake spoke as if he didn\u2019t want any discussion about the matter.</p><p>\u201cMarried? Bridesmaids\u2019 gowns?\u201d Darien asked, his voice low.</p><p>\u201cWe were all set to just go to a justice of the peace, but Lelandi wouldn\u2019t hear of it.\u201d Jake shoved his hands in his pockets, almost wishing Darien would make Lelandi cease and desist. But he knew Darien wouldn\u2019t. \u201cGuess who gets to give the bride away.\u201d</p><p>Darien looked at Tom, who was grinning big time now.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me,\u201d Tom said. \u201cYou\u2019re the pack leader.\u201d</p><p>Darien groaned. \u201cHell, if it wasn\u2019t for Lelandi\u2019s temperamental condition, I\u2019d put my foot down and say absolutely not. So when the hell is it scheduled?\u201d</p><p>Jake sighed. \u201cWhat do I know? The women have taken over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when the women are pregnant,\u201d Peter said, although since he wasn\u2019t mated, he hadn\u2019t had to deal with all the ups and downs himself.</p><p>Darien\u2019s gaze swung back to Jake.</p><p>This time Jake couldn\u2019t contain the delight in his expression or tone of voice. He sounded like a kid at Christmas. \u201cAlicia\u2019s pregnant, Doc says. With triplets.\u201d</p><p>Darien was still frowning. \u201cYours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppears that way.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when Darien\u2019s smile first appeared. He said to Tom, \u201cYou\u2019re next, little brother. We\u2019ll have a boomtown here before we know it.\u201d</p><p>The next morning, on the drive to Denver to see the police about Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s murder, Alicia had a panic attack. Although it wasn\u2019t really a panic attack because the panic was for real. The moon was at its fullest, and although it was daytime and the moon wasn\u2019t easy to see, it was there all the same.</p><p>And Alicia knew, despite trying to stop it, that she was getting ready to shift. She was worn out from the discovery the day before about her father and learning she was pregnant with triplets, as well as Lelandi\u2019s rush to help her find a gown before Alicia couldn\u2019t wear one unless it was a maternity gown, and Jake loving her all night long. She\u2019d been sleeping with her head in Jake\u2019s lap as Tom drove the SUV to Denver, while Peter sat in the front passenger\u2019s seat and remained quiet. Another SUV filled with four more pack members followed, making her feel safe and protected and totally overwhelmed by all of the events of the past couple of days.</p><p>But all of a sudden, she began to get really, really hot. That brought back into focus how she wasn\u2019t herself anymore. The first thing she did was worry about the babies. Would the shift hurt them? Then she realized that werewolves had lived like this for a very long time, and they\u2019d survived all these years, so everything would be all right.</p><p>But Alicia still had little control over her shifting, and she desperately needed to get out of her clothes. Lelandi had explained that stripping out of their clothes in front of other pack members was a natural process, and the shift happened so quickly that no one got much of a look at anyone else anyway. But none of that made it any easier to swallow.</p><p>Alicia bolted upright, and immediately Jake stiffened. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Alicia?\u201d</p><p>Peter glanced over the seat at her. Tom looked in the rearview mirror to see what the matter was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to shift.\u201d She climbed in none too ladylike a way over the back of the seat to get into the rear seat, more hidden from the view of the bucket seats that Tom and Peter were sitting in up front. And then she began stripping out of her clothes.</p><p>Darien had tried to convince the Denver police that Alicia had been feeling too poorly to see them right away, due to her pregnancy, but because the police were investigating a murder and had no clues as to who had done the crime, they wouldn\u2019t hear of any delays.</p><p>They would treat her with care, they assured Darien. Jake and the rest of the pack hadn\u2019t been worried about her pregnancy but this business with shape-shifting. By the time she got her clothes off, she was shape-shifting.</p><p>Jake said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine when we\u2019re speaking to the police officers, Alicia. You can get it out of your system for now...\u201d</p><p>She growled at him. She meant for it to be a grumble, but she wasn\u2019t sure how to make a grumbly wolf sound. It just came out an irritated growl and was a lot harsher to her ears than she had intended. Peter and Tom smiled. Jake reached over the back of his seat and scratched her between the ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bumped his hand with her nose, trying to make up with him, and he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he repeated, but the undercurrent of tension relayed a promise. The pack would take care of her\u2014and the police officers\u2014if she screwed up.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Alicia didn\u2019t want to screw up in front of the police. She didn\u2019t want to always be a problem for the pack. Lying in the backseat of the SUV in wolf form, she tried to think of something other than the interrogation that awaited her.</p> <p>But she was having a difficult time thinking of anything else. This time, like when she\u2019d been questioned about the shootings at the Crestview Motel, she\u2019d have to tell the truth, minus the wolf part of the tale. She\u2019d discussed the wolf business with Jake and his brothers\u2014and Peter because he had the mind of a cop. But she knew from past experience that no matter how prepared she might be to tell the police her story, one little bit of evidence she hadn\u2019t known about, one little thing like an eyewitness account could throw her version of what had happened into the sewer.</p><p>Instead, she tried to think about her wedding dress\u2014a cream-colored, A-line gown with a corset-type bodice that had asymmetrical swirls wrapped around it, embellished with lace and pearls in a soft, shimmery satin. The full-pleated skirt that swirled out in full opulence below the slim-fitted bodice cupped her derriere and then extended out into an elegant train. The dress made her feel like a fairy princess, and Jake was definitely her fairy-tale knight.</p><p>Some of the younger women had clamored to take part in the wedding and would be wearing violet dresses as bridesmaids. Several girls would participate as flower girls, and Lelandi would be the matron of honor. Because of all the teasing Jake was getting over the whole affair, he had selected Tom, Peter, Sam, and four other men to be his groomsmen, while Tom was the best man. Darien would serve as the father of the bride. Others he had tasked to serve as ushers. Alicia had been amused because although most of the men tried to show they didn\u2019t care for the idea of a wedding, she saw another side of them\u2014a sense of family, of celebration, of belonging\u2014and their enthusiasm didn\u2019t go unnoticed.</p><p>The men participating would wear black tuxes with gray satin cravats and tuxedo vests. The best part? The woman in charge of the bridal shop said she\u2019d have everything ready to go in a week\u2019s time, which was good because Alicia kept fretting that she might start to show and the gown wouldn\u2019t fit. She groaned. What if she shape-shifted in the middle of the ceremony? First wedding ever for a lupus garou pack and first major disaster. She could see it now. No one would ever allow a wedding ceremony to take place again.</p><p>In her wolf form, she lay down on the backseat and closed her eyes. She hadn\u2019t told Lelandi the truth about having had weddings before because she\u2019d been trying to get out of doing anything this formal. But Alicia had never had a wedding dress. Never been married in a church. Never had a bridesmaid or a father to give her away. Just a mother and her boyfriend to serve as her witnesses in front of a judge, twice.</p> <p>She smiled at the thought of being a beautiful bride for Jake.</p><p>Then she sighed. He didn\u2019t want this. He probably wouldn\u2019t be happy with any of it, no matter how nice the ceremony was or how excited the ladies were about having it. She hadn\u2019t been able to read Darien. Apparently, he\u2019d agreed to give her away, but he had seemed distracted, probably over this further police business. She suspected he was worried that she could get all of the pack members who went with her in trouble if she ended up shape-shifting while being questioned. And that\u2019s when she began to worry about the interrogation again.</p><p>She must have managed to sleep for a couple of hours. When she finally awoke from a nice wolf nap, she was surprised that her head was in Jake\u2019s lap. When had he climbed into the rear seat with her?</p><p>He was stroking her back in a soothing way, and when she lifted her head, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re almost there. But if we have to, we\u2019ll just park somewhere until you can shape-shift. We\u2019ll tell the police we were held up because of a flat tire, running out of gas, something.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, cursed her inability to shift when she needed to, and tried to convince herself it was time to be a human. A few minutes later, she was hastily getting dressed in the rear seat, hoping the tinted windows were truly tinted enough so that no one could see into the vehicle while they were parked under a shade tree in a park.</p><p>Once she was presentable, Peter drove the SUV to Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s condo where the police were supposed to meet them.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Peter said quietly a few minutes later, as if he was trying not to upset her and cause her to shift again.</p><p>She had no idea why the urge to shift came and went like it did. She suspected it had something to do with having not changed in so long since the last time.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Jake asked, running his hand over her stomach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. At least I hope I\u2019ll be.\u201d But she really wasn\u2019t. Every inch of her body was feeling the tension, and she was terrified she\u2019d get their kind into trouble.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d Jake said, sounding like he wanted to get this over in a hurry, just like she did.</p><p>Her bodyguard detail stayed in the second vehicle, figuring that with the police here, she\u2019d have no trouble. Jake took Alicia\u2019s hand and led her to the front door of the brick two-story condo, while Tom and Peter followed. An officer let them in while two others watched them, and then introductions were shared around the living room. Helm Sanderson was tall and stout and looked down at her like she was in for real trouble. John Kohn looked like he\u2019d slept in his clothes, his face wearing a couple of days\u2019 growth of blond stubble, his eyes bloodshot. The last detective, Arthur Connelly, was younger than the other two and kept looking at them as if reading their cues on what to do.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat, Miss Greiston,\u201d Sanderson said, motioning to the couch where she\u2019d seen Ferdinand\u2019s dead body.</p><p>If the detectives had wanted to see her reaction, to see if she\u2019d actually witnessed Massaro sitting dead on that couch, they hadn\u2019t needed to do anything further.</p> <p>\u201cI... I don\u2019t feel well,\u201d she suddenly said, a cold sweat breaking out across her skin, her vision blurring as a fresh wave of nausea struck. She rushed for what she hoped was the kitchen.</p><p>She could smell the death in the room although they\u2019d cleaned the place up. She could smell the colognes of the men who\u2019d murdered Ferdinand. The odors were making her gag, bringing back the terror she\u2019d experienced when the one man had come looking for her and she\u2019d barely breathed beneath the bed.</p><p>She made it in time to throw up in the sink, as Jake drew close and rubbed her back gently. She noticed the youngest detective watching her, while the other two remained in the living room with Tom and Peter. Had Detective Connelly come to see if she was truly sick or just faking it? Or was he just not as jaded as the older detectives? She halfway suspected he was checking on her to see if she was faking being sick.</p><p>Jake got a paper towel and offered it to her. She cupped her hands under the faucet and rinsed out her mouth, not wanting to touch anything else in the condo, although they would have already dusted everything for fingerprints. And yes, had found her prints on the front door. Not that she had been thinking very clearly that night. Not when she had found Massaro dead, was afraid for her own life, and was trying to get over the fact she\u2019d turned into a wolf.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Miss Greiston?\u201d Detective Connelly asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed feebly, feeling horrible.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant with triplets,\u201d Jake explained.</p><p>The detective quickly looked at Alicia\u2019s waist, back to her face, and turned pale. He put his hands out and motioned back to the living room. \u201cPlease, come in and sit down, if you think you can manage now.\u201d</p><p>Jake took her arm and led her back into the room. Once they were in the living area, he let her guide him to where she wanted to sit. When she was seated on a couch at a right angle to the one where Massaro had been murdered, Sanderson sat down only inches from where Massaro had been sitting and said, \u201cTell us what happened. From the beginning. Don\u2019t leave any detail out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a lawyer,\u201d Alicia said, tilting her chin up and staring Sanderson down.</p><p>Everyone stared at her in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel well,\u201d she continued. \u201cI haven\u2019t committed any crime, yet I feel I may be incriminating myself if I don\u2019t have a lawyer present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a suspect, Miss Greiston. If you have nothing to hide...\u201d Detective Sanderson said, spreading his arms wide as if trying to reassure her that talking to him wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI want a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Jake could tell something was wrong with Alicia, more than just the pregnancy. He was worried she was fighting shape-shifting again. \u201cIs she free to go until we can get hold of a lawyer?\u201d</p><p>Detective Sanderson looked pissed off as he folded his arms. \u201cWe need to know what happened. She was in the condo. We have a warrant to get a blood sample from her. We have her prints on the inside doorknob. So what happened when Massaro was murdered? We want to know what she saw or heard, who was here, anything that could help us piece together what happened so we can catch whoever did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she was here? And didn\u2019t report a murder? Then she could be charged with a crime,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIs she free until we can obtain legal representation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a suspect. Just a person of interest. In fact, we suspect she was a victim, if the bloodstains are hers,\u201d Sanderson insisted. \u201cWe know she was here. We know she\u2019s afraid of them. That she was afraid they might learn she was here and would kill her for it. But whatever she can tell us can help us to nail them.\u201d</p><p>Jake helped Alicia to her feet. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch as soon as we get a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could hold her for obstructing justice,\u201d Sanderson said, playing hardball. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s sick,\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cPregnant with triplets,\u201d Detective Connelly said urgently, looking as though he was afraid she\u2019d expire on the spot.</p><p>Sanderson looked at him as if the guy couldn\u2019t be that naive.</p> <p>\u201cIf she were to miscarry,\u201d Jake said with dark promise, \u201cevery media source would hear about it.\u201d</p><p>For the longest time, Jake and Sanderson measured each other with steely gazes in a showdown of wills. Then Sanderson said, \u201cAll right. Get your lawyer. You\u2019ve got twenty-four hours. Just let us know where you\u2019re staying until then.\u201d</p><p>Jake took Alicia\u2019s arm and started to lead her to the door.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s her doctor, by the way?\u201d Detective Sanderson asked. \u201cJust in case we need to get in touch with him.\u201d He gave a sardonic smile.</p><p>\u201cDr. Weber can fax you a copy of her pregnancy test, if you need it,\u201d Jake said sharply, then walked her out the door as Tom and Peter followed close behind.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Alicia?\u201d Jake asked, as he took her out of the building and toward the SUV.</p><p>\u201cThe smells in there were overwhelming. And the memories. I\u2019m so sorry, but I had to get away. The wolf senses felt as though they were crushing me. I just couldn\u2019t think straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSanderson\u2019s a real bastard,\u201d Tom said. \u201cI could smell that Massaro had died on that couch where he was sitting, the location where he had motioned for you to sit initially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame ploy I would have used as a detective,\u201d Peter said. \u201cRattle the witness. Secure any kind of statement that would help me to solve my case.\u201d</p><p>Alicia cast him an annoyed look, but as green around the gills as she felt, she doubted her look was as annoyed as she wished to appear. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you could be that mean.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a small smile. \u201cOnly with a nonwolf type who was involved up to her hairline. In your case, no, I wouldn\u2019t have stooped so low. But then, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to.\u201d</p> <p>She raised her brows at him in question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not out to solve this crime for the city of Denver, but to solve this crime so we can go after the killers themselves and stop them from getting to you.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and reached over to squeeze his arm. \u201cThanks, Peter. I didn\u2019t mean to say you were like Sanderson. You\u2019ve been nothing but kind to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been my pleasure, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cWe have no idea who might be a wolf lawyer who could represent us the way we need him to.\u201d</p><p>Alicia noted that Jake was awfully quiet as he opened the SUV door for her. He cleared his throat. \u201cI know a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>Both Tom and Peter looked surprised. Alicia wondered if the man didn\u2019t like newly turned wolves. Why else would Jake seem so reluctant to mention him?</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Tom asked.</p> <p>\u201cSherry Slate.\u201d</p><p>The only reason he could be reluctant about mentioning the woman was because she\u2019d meant something to Jake. An awkward silence stretched between them.</p><p>Finally, Jake closed the door and looked at Tom, who was staring at him with incredulity. Alicia guessed Jake must have been seeing some women without his family knowing it. Peter looked just as surprised.</p><p>When he got in the SUV, Jake said to Tom, \u201cTake us to Hill and Sanders. It\u2019s a law firm.\u201d</p><p>Peter set the GPS, and they were off.</p><p>Everything was so quiet in the vehicle that Alicia could hear everyone\u2019s heartbeats. She finally took Jake\u2019s arm and draped it over her, snuggling close to him as he tightened his arm around her. If she understood the ways of the werewolves, she knew he couldn\u2019t have been seriously involved with Sherry. They didn\u2019t have any sexual intimacy unless they planned to mate for life. Still, maybe this Sherry had expected something more of the relationship. And now instead of being Alicia\u2019s advocate, Sherry could seal her fate.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t, could she? As werewolves, wouldn\u2019t doing something like that hurt all of their kind?</p><p>She relaxed a little as Jake\u2019s hand caressed her shoulder. She didn\u2019t question him about the woman, figuring he didn\u2019t want to talk about her in front of Tom and Peter. But then he must have decided it was more important to get this out in the open before they met with the woman.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen each other a couple of times. Lelandi had talked me into coming here first to drop off some of my photographs at one of the art galleries, as you recall.\u201d He was speaking to Tom and Peter. \u201cSherry collects modern art. I was here alone, not knowing anyone. She was a wolf.\u201d Jake shrugged. \u201cWe had lunch. Took in a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive-in?\u201d Alicia asked, hating that she sounded so suspicious.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo. Nothing happened between us. She\u2019s very much in charge and loves her job, her life here in the city, and her pack. She wouldn\u2019t have ever considered moving to a small place like Silver Town. There was never any spark between us. It was just a mutual friendship.\u201d</p><p>So why had Jake been reluctant to mention her to anyone?</p><p>\u201cShe thought it was more than that?\u201d Alicia asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say she wanted more than that. But her fascination with me was more that I was someone new, an alpha, a challenge. I let her know I wasn\u2019t interested in anything more than friendship. She didn\u2019t like being turned down. I felt it was akin to her losing a case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t happen to know any male attorneys who could help me out, do you?\u201d Alicia asked wistfully.</p><p>\u201cShe knows her role in our society. Protect the wolf kind. She won\u2019t do anything to get you into any kind of trouble.\u201d</p><p>At least not more than Alicia was already. Wait until Sherry Slate learned Alicia was pregnant with Jake\u2019s triplets!</p><p>As soon as Jake called Sherry, she cleared her schedule for the afternoon, but when he told her what it was about, he could tell she was ready to rethink her afternoon plans.</p><p>\u201cShe needs your help,\u201d Jake said, pleading. Hell, Sherry was a professional. He wanted to tell her to act like it. \u201cUnless you know another lawyer in the Denver area that might be able to help her.\u201d Like one of Sherry\u2019s partners, if any were werewolf types and had the time.</p><p>He swore he could hear Sherry\u2019s spine stiffening. He imagined she did not easily give up difficult cases.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak with her.\u201d Sherry\u2019s tone was clipped.</p><p>Jake was afraid Alicia was in for an even rougher time of it. But they didn\u2019t have a whole lot of choice.</p><p>When they arrived at the office, Jake assumed from the waiting room that the law firm was doing well. The luxurious seating was on leather couches and chairs, much more ostentatious than at the law offices in Silver Town. A pretty receptionist sat at the counter, with blond hair in curls down to her shoulders and bright green eyes. She smiled at Jake and Tom, raised her brow at Peter, undoubtedly because he was wearing his uniform, and gave a cursory glance in Alicia\u2019s direction.</p><p>The first thing Jake noticed about her was her feminine wolf smell. Plus a number of wolf scents had been left in the reception area. Just the place Alicia needed to be, among their own kind where they would protect her with whatever they could.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to see Ms. Slate? She\u2019ll be out in just a moment. If you\u2019d like to take a seat...\u201d The receptionist motioned to the chairs.</p><p>Jake sat with Alicia on one of the couches while Peter and Tom took seats in nearby chairs. And then they waited. And waited. And waited.</p><p>After half an hour, Jake rose and walked over to the counter. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s someone else who has more time and could see us?\u201d</p><p>The woman glanced back at the door that led to the offices down the hall. \u201cLet me check with Ms. Slate and see if that\u2019s acceptable.\u201d She punched in some numbers and said, \u201cMs. Slate, Mr. Jake Silver was asking if it would be much longer.\u201d</p><p>He was amused the receptionist didn\u2019t tell Sherry that he would seek another lawyer in her place if she didn\u2019t get her butt in gear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d Sherry snapped over the phone.</p><p>Jake was afraid the animosity in her voice spelled more trouble for Alicia.</p><p>After a few more minutes, Sherry walked into the reception area, looking professional and long-legged and wearing an expensive-looking black skirt and jacket and black high-heeled shoes. A smile was pasted on her face for Jake. She took hold of his hand and held on as if momentarily claiming him and said, \u201cSo good of you to see me again.\u201d Then she glanced at Tom and her smile broadened.</p><p>Someone new to switch her attention to?</p><p>Her gaze slid to Peter, her smile never changing, and then she shifted her attention to the object of her annoyance, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cMiss Greiston, I presume,\u201d Sherry said with chilly politeness, her smile instantly fading. She looked Alicia over as if trying to figure out why Jake had picked her over herself. \u201cCome on back to my office, if you would.\u201d</p><p>Jake took Alicia\u2019s ice-cold hand and followed Sherry, who he swore swayed her hips more than she\u2019d done the last couple of times he\u2019d seen her. In fact, his impression of her had always been one of professional detachment, as if she was trying to maintain a businesswoman\u2019s appearance no matter where she was or what she was doing.</p><p>In sharp contrast, Alicia wore a robin\u2019s egg blue skirt that softly swirled below her knees with her every step and a matching top of some kind of silky fabric that he enjoyed touching and sliding his fingers over. She wore heels, but not as high as Sherry\u2019s, and they were strappy, sexy, and much more appealing. And while Sherry\u2019s hair was pulled back in a severe twist of curls at the back of her head, Alicia\u2019s softly caressed her shoulders in an inviting way. Sherry was elegant in a professional way, while Alicia was enticing in a feminine way.</p><p>When they reached Sherry\u2019s office, she motioned to a chair in front of her desk and Alicia took the seat as Jake sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cWell, as you probably know, Jake filled me in on your story. Quite a tale,\u201d Sherry said, with a biting edge to her words as she took a seat behind her desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour partners in the law firm are wolves,\u201d Jake said. Having smelled several in the reception area, he assumed the law firm was made up of werewolves. But it was also a way of letting Sherry know that if she couldn\u2019t deal with this on a strictly professional basis, he\u2019d look elsewhere for help.</p><p>She smiled coyly, immediately getting his drift. \u201cFor our friendship, Jake, I won\u2019t charge anything for my services.\u201d She focused again on Alicia. \u201cSo exactly how did you get yourself into this mess?\u201d She held a hand up, stopping Alicia before she could say a word. \u201cTell me from the beginning what happened.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p> <p>Mario swore at Danny as he paced around his condo in Breckenridge. \u201cWhat the hell do you mean Rudy\u2019s in police custody? And didn\u2019t I tell you to... hell, disappear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police were keeping a tight lid on Rudy\u2019s arrest. Hell, I dropped by Alicia\u2019s apartment to see why Rudy wasn\u2019t answering his cell phone while he was waiting there to see if she returned. Not only were the police there, but Alicia was coming out of her apartment with three other men after the police left. One was wearing a uniform, but they all took off in two vehicles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you followed them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. From a safe distance. They drove to Silver Town, then out through the country and pulled off on a private paved road. I couldn\u2019t see it, but I imagine a house is tucked back into the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Rudy use his phone privilege to call you so you\u2019d tell me and we could get him a lawyer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI checked with the police, and some sergeant informed me that Rudy had gotten his phone call.\u201d</p><p>Mario stared at Danny. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell. I want him out of there before he says something he shouldn\u2019t. Did Celinas say he\u2019d gotten in touch with Rudy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I called the lawyer right away. He hadn\u2019t had any word, so he went down to the jailhouse, and they said Rudy already had a lawyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome guy named Alistair Gray. He\u2019s a lawyer in the area, and he convinced Rudy he\u2019d save his hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Celinas I want him down there changing Rudy\u2019s mind. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. And sir?\u201d</p><p>Mario frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cI got word Miss Greiston is being questioned by the Denver police. Seems she was at Ferdinand\u2019s condo when we killed him.\u201d</p><p>Mario stared at him, then shook his head. \u201cDamn it, Danny. I told you Jimmy said Ferdinand had taken her before we terminated him. She must have been hiding somewhere in the place. So what did she see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to our source, she wouldn\u2019t speak to them without a lawyer present.\u201d</p><p>Mario rubbed his chin, then stalked over to the window and stared out. \u201cWas she still with the men she\u2019d been with earlier at her place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re sticking pretty close to her. Plus they had another SUV full of bodyguards protecting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to find where she\u2019s staying? It\u2019s probably in Silver Town. Celinas checked with the art gallery and learned Jake Silver is the artsy-fartsy lover boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a dead man,\u201d Mario grumbled under his breath.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a home that\u2019s even more isolated than the house I followed them to. I could put some men on it and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just give me the location, and I\u2019ll check it out.\u201d Hell, the artist would not be able to stand up to a wolf. Mario would kill him and take Alicia for his own. And then he\u2019d hide her away from the police, from humans\u2014his trophy mate. She was a werewolf now. And as much trouble as her mother had given him, and then Alicia, she would pay for it.</p><p>Danny was another story. Mario hated to eliminate his last cousin, but once the police learned the gun Danny had hidden in his house had killed both Missy and Tony, they were sure to link Danny to him. He just had to think of a way to get rid of Danny so that no one would ever learn of it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll only do this with the promise Alicia Greiston will not have any threat of prosecution,\u201d Sherry Slate told Detective Sanderson while Jake listened in at Massaro\u2019s condo. Peter and Tom stayed with Alicia in the hallway until the detective had agreed to the lawyer\u2019s terms. \u201cShe saw nothing, heard voices, but that was all. She doesn\u2019t know who the men were who murdered Ferdinand Massaro. Although, like you, she suspects Mario Constantino had him killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d the detective grudgingly said.</p><p>\u201cRemember what I said about her delicate condition,\u201d Sherry repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to go to your superiors if you make this difficult for her. She was the victim in all this.\u201d</p><p>Sanderson nodded once, his blue eyes hard. Jake could tell the detective didn\u2019t like being dictated to by a lawyer, particularly because she was a woman, Jake suspected.</p><p>After half an hour of questioning, Alicia appeared worn out. But she looked relieved, too, when Jake bundled her up in the car and headed on the long drive back to Silver Town. All he could think of was lighting a fire in the fireplace at his home, making her a cup of hot chocolate with whipped cream on top, and cuddling with her in front of the fire until he could coax her into bed. He wanted to make love to her, like he always did, but he wanted to comfort her if that\u2019s what she needed more for the time being than the lovemaking. They had a lifetime of that ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Jake asked as he held her close and she snuggled against him in the middle seat of the SUV.</p><p>\u201cHow nice Sherry ended up being. I mean, she loathed me, but she really was very good at her job. Of course, I think she was trying to catch Tom\u2019s eye and probably didn\u2019t think she\u2019d stand a chance if she didn\u2019t try her best to get me out of hot water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had to or face the consequences. No newly turned wolf could be incarcerated without causing dire consequences for all of us,\u201d Jake reminded her, rubbing her shoulder in a loving way.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She turned her attention to Tom and asked, \u201cWhat did you think of her, Tom? Possibilities?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s just like Jake said. All business through and through. I doubt she has a seductive bone in her body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes all a woman needs is the right man.\u201d Alicia ran her hand over Jake\u2019s thigh.</p><p>He slipped his hand beneath her blouse and stroked a bra-covered breast, enjoying the way her nipple strained against the silky fabric with his touch. If they\u2019d had more privacy, he would have taken her cue and had his way with her. Stopping at a hotel on the way was an idea, too. But he couldn\u2019t inconvenience everyone with his insatiable need to have her.</p><p>Tom said, \u201cDarien told me everyone in the pack is coming to the wedding. It\u2019ll be a feast to end all feasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLelandi said it would be in the clearing in the woods out back,\u201d Alicia said. \u201cIs it big enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Tom said. \u201cWe have pack games and other pack gatherings there.\u201d He turned to give Jake an annoyed look. \u201cYou realize that after this wedding is over, Lelandi\u2019s going to be on my case even more about finding a mate, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cHer babies are coming soon. She\u2019ll be wrapped up in that. So you\u2019re off the hook for a little while.\u201d</p><p>Alicia was melting into Jake\u2019s lap, and he was getting damned hard as he continued to massage one of her breasts. \u201cTell Peter to drive faster,\u201d she whispered to Jake.</p><p>Tom shook his head, probably having overheard Alicia\u2019s words spoken in private to Jake. \u201cHell, I\u2019ve got to get me a mate,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>Of all the damned things, Mario thought as he circled in his wolf form around the house that the artist lover-boy owned. Wolves lived in this area. Were they wolf-wolves or werewolves? He couldn\u2019t tell the difference. But never having met any other werewolf types except the bastard he\u2019d killed and the ones he\u2019d made, although only one still lived, he hadn\u2019t thought many more existed. They probably were regular wolves.</p><p>He sniffed the area and listened. No one was here. The place was quiet, and no one was guarding it. He figured that when Jake Silver returned with Alicia, he\u2019d most likely have that bodyguard force with him. Mario was going to have to enlist the help of the one other man he\u2019d turned if they had to fight a couple of wolves. Danny and a couple of others would have to be the firepower to serve as a distraction so he could grab Alicia and leave. Things were getting too hot for Mario in Colorado. A warrant had been issued for Danny\u2019s arrest, and he was a dead man once Mario got his hands on Alicia.</p><p>Not only was that damned police chief in Breckenridge breathing down Mario\u2019s neck, but the Denver police somehow had linked his name to Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s death. And the Feds were looking into Tony Thomas\u2019s death, somehow linking him to someone named Antonio Frasero.</p><p>Mario was thinking of going someplace else. Somewhere in Minnesota, maybe. Up nearer to the Canadian border where he could slip away if need be. He\u2019d heard there were real wolves in those parts. That meant he could blend in.</p><p>All his trouble had started with that damned Tony. If he hadn\u2019t been looking into Mario\u2019s business dealings, and then if Missy Greiston hadn\u2019t gotten involved, everything would have gone along like it always had. Their deaths had gotten Missy\u2019s daughter involved, and she had created even more trouble for Mario. One little woman. Wolf now. He\u2019d show Alicia what it meant to mess with him.</p><p>He turned and loped off to his car hidden in the woods. Time to get reinforcements.</p><p>After dinner at Darien\u2019s and a much more relaxed atmosphere, except for Lelandi bringing up the wedding plans again, Alicia had had a wonderful time with the family and already felt as though she\u2019d known them forever. When she and Jake returned to his home, guards were again posted outside. She hated that men had to stand guard detail all night, although Jake assured her no one minded doing what they needed to when they had to keep pack members safe. Even so, she did feel much safer knowing they were there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jake made her sit on the couch and watch the orange flames shoot up toward the chimney as he heated cups of hot chocolate. She could envision a winter-filled landscape out the big picture windows when the first snowfall began and how beautiful the woods would be. Just like her favorite poem by Robert Frost, \u201cStopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA penny for your thoughts,\u201d Jake said, stalking back into the living room with two cups of steaming hot chocolate for them to drink.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you how much I love you? You\u2019ve rescued me more times than I can count. Been my knight, my protector, never condemned me for having so many husbands when your kind never divorce.\u201d She took a deep breath, then sipped her hot chocolate, the rich velvety flavor tantalizing her tongue and the aroma making her take another deep breath of it.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because our animal senses help us to find the right mate the first time around. And our loyalty is inborn,\u201d he said, watching the way she curled her tongue around a dollop of whipped cream before it melted into the chocolate. He took a swig of his drink. \u201cWe don\u2019t go through a phase where we feel we\u2019re missing out if we don\u2019t ditch the old way of life and try out someone new.\u201d</p><p>She took another wondrous sip of the chocolate and whipped cream and sighed. She licked her lips, and his gaze switched to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWe renew our love for each other in special ways to spark the old flame. It\u2019s important to our kind to stay together throughout our lives. Although if we lose a mate, we\u2019re free to find a new one. Some do. Some don\u2019t. Besides, Alicia, the men you ended up with were real jerks. I already told you so,\u201d Jake said, adamant about it.</p><p>But then he smiled at her with a speculative gleam in his eye. \u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone would prefer to watch ice hockey to watching you dance on ice like you do.\u201d He shook his head and took another sip of his hot chocolate.</p><p>She studied the chocolate and a speck of whipped cream on his lips, tilted her chin up and licked both off his lips.</p> <p>He set his half-finished cocoa down on the coffee table and took her free hand in his. She hastily finished her cocoa, not wanting to give up a drop, and set her mug down with his, knowing he had other business in mind, and she was all for it.</p><p>His hands combed through her thick curls as he pressed her back against the couch with his body and kissed her hungrily. But then he took a deep breath, rose from the couch, and lifted her into his arms. \u201cAlthough the men are watching the house to protect you, I don\u2019t want to distract them from their business. No drapes on the windows,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom and I took the old ones down. They were worn and badly needed to be replaced. I actually had it in mind to leave the windows bare to show off the view. Living alone or with Tom, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. But with you, that\u2019s another story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, unbuttoning his shirt as he strode down the hall to the only furnished bedroom, carrying her tightly in his arms. \u201cI didn\u2019t think any of your pack members would look.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThey\u2019re only human, Alicia. And a lot wolf.\u201d</p> <p>He carried her into the bedroom, and before she even sank into her soft, comforting mattress, she thought of how wonderful it would be to make love again to Jake in her bed. Not in some unfamiliar motel room or in the forest, although anything would do, but still, she felt a certain possessiveness in knowing they weren\u2019t in a strange bed, but hers. And he was hers. In her bed. And not just for a one-night stand.</p><p>The concept that anyone might want her forever still seemed foreign, but for this night and for as long as they would have each other, she knew her dream had come true. The home was quiet, too, unlike the noisy apartment she was used to. With her enhanced hearing, it would have been worse. But here...</p><p>She sighed as Jake sat her on the bed.</p><p>Here it was quiet and peaceful, the only sounds the faint rustle of tree branches fluttering in the breeze, the trickle of running water in a stream nearby, and Jake\u2019s heartbeat ratchetting up several notches. Comforting, pleasing sounds.</p><p>Jake was unbuttoning his shirt, watching her expression. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Alicia? You have kind of a lost look on your face. Like you\u2019re a million miles away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d she said, unbuttoning her blouse, \u201chow I would have you in my bed again, and how wonderful that notion is.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and lifted an arrogant brow at hearing her words. \u201cWere you now?\u201d He tugged off his shirt and tossed it on a chair. Then like a wolf on the prowl, he put his hands on the bed on either side of her hips, caging her in as his mouth sought hers, melded with hers, and caressed hers. His body pressed against her knees, forcing her to part her legs for him. Yet he kept his weight off her, all except his mouth kissing and loving hers, and now her thighs caressed his as he leaned between them.</p><p>All at once she didn\u2019t feel as in control or that she had him in her bed, but that he claimed her and her bed for his own. The notion both excited and thrilled her.</p> <p>Her hands went around his bare waist, loving his silky skin and hard muscles. Her bare thighs pressed against his soft stonewashed jeans, his thighs tensed beneath the fabric.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hard,\u201d she whispered, moving her hands down his waist to his lean hips, circling around to his buttocks, and then sweeping around to his crotch.</p><p>As soon as she caressed him, she felt him lose his measured control of the situation. He groaned and fumbled to remove her blouse, and she knew then that she had him right where she wanted him. He finally managed to pull off her blouse and toss it aside. Then he was searching blindly for the zipper on her skirt while he kept kissing her lips, maintaining the intimacy between them. She tugged to unfasten his belt, wanting to touch him skin to skin. But he clearly wanted her naked first. And she was still struggling with his belt when she heard her skirt zipper yield.</p><p>He was trying to tug her skirt down her hips while she was sitting, and he finally placed his hands on her shoulders, forcing her to lie on her back so he could slip the silky skirt off her. Then his belt gave! And she slid his zipper down, her fingers pressing the fastener against his arousal all the way down.</p><p>\u201cAlicia,\u201d he groaned, half-dying in agony, half-pleading in ecstasy.</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d she said, with an uplifted tilt to her voice as she wiggled to help him remove her skirt.</p><p>She peeled his jeans down, but before she could slip her hand inside his boxers, he pulled off his jeans the rest of the way, then pressed his body against hers on the mattress, thwarting her, taking handfuls of her hair, and kissing her mouth again. She had the distinct impression he wanted to last, and if she kept touching him, he wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>He rubbed his hardness against her skimpy red thong\u2014the one he\u2019d bought her at the boutique in town\u2014and she slid her hands up his boxers and caressed his bare buttocks. She thought she heard him curse under his breath as he plunged his hand into the front of her nearly nothing panties, found her sweet spot, and began to stroke her into a world of heightened pleasure she\u2019d only been able to feel when he was touching her.</p><p>And now she was losing control, the tide of swelling pleasure rising up in her as he took her higher and higher, her hands stilled on his buttocks, his tongue plunging deeply, erotically into her mouth.</p><p>He tasted of chocolate and whipped cream delight, his masculine scent and arousal arousing her, every sense heightened because of the wolf in her, every sensation more profound then she\u2019d ever experienced. Before she could cling to the peak, the wave of ecstasy crashed over her.</p><p>Hot, wet, sexy Alicia, Jake thought as he stroked her into climax. He swore if she had stroked him like she was about to do, he would never have lasted. She was a godsend, and he wanted to pleasure her like she should have always been loved. Like he\u2019d always love her. With her body still shuddering with completion, he meant to strip out of his boxers, but she was already yanking them down.</p><p>He smiled as he nuzzled her cheek, then when he was free of his boxers, he eased into her and pressed homeward. The bond between them would never be broken. Her hands roamed over his back and butt, caressing and stirring him into action, as he deepened his thrusts and claimed her again as if the ritual needed to be repeated to show her he meant to be here for her forever.</p><p>Her eyes were filled with wonderment as he gazed into them, her lips full, wet, and well-kissed, her breath light and barely audible, and then her eyes closed as she arched her pelvis against him, matching his thrusts, her fingers clenching tighter on his buttocks. She cried out, \u201cJake, oh, Jake,\u201d and moaned as she sank against the mattress, his seed filling her after that, and he collapsed on top of her in satiated bliss. He wrapped his arms around her, his whole posture stating she was his, and he blanketed her in his protective cocoon to ensure that.</p><p>She lay very still for several minutes while their hearts beat rapidly in unison and he continued to hold her close. Then she whispered, \u201cThey had to have heard me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek, rolled off her, pulled her against his chest, and covered them with the sheet and comforter.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell her no, when he knew they had to have, and she\u2019d probably figure they had. He couldn\u2019t tell her yes and confirm what she had to suspect. So he\u2019d just said hmm.</p><p>She let out her breath and toyed with his nipple. \u201cNext time, if we have a bodyguard detail outside our windows, don\u2019t let me make a sound. All right?\u201d She looked up at him with her brows creased.</p><p>He chuckled and ran his hand over her silky hair. \u201cThey already know what we\u2019re doing in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. But... at least they would have to guess when it came to the um... end.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>That\u2019s when they heard the sound of pops in the woods surrounding the house. Jake was out of the bed in a flash. For a second, he wasn\u2019t sure what to do\u2014dress and grab his gun, or shift.</p><p>\u201cJake,\u201d Alicia said, sounding scared, her eyes huge.</p><p>\u201cStay here. I\u2019ve got to see what\u2019s happening.\u201d Then he shifted and bumped Alicia\u2019s hand with his nose. After she ran her hand over his head, he turned and dashed out of the bedroom, intent on getting to his men and taking care of whomever was causing trouble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nothing had been unpacked, Alicia thought as she hurried out of bed, pulled on her bra and panties, and then looked for a box that might have a pair of jeans and a sweater. Frantically digging clothes out of one, then another of the boxes, she finally found a pair of jeans.</p><p>But before she could put them on, she heard footfalls headed in her direction down the hall at a full-out run. Her heart went into overdrive.</p><p>Chapter 21</p> <p>Jake smelled the scent of the damn wolves before he could locate them in the woods. Peter and three other members of his pack were looking for the men who had been shooting at them. Sam had been hit, damn it.</p><p>He was sitting in the grass, holding someone\u2019s bunched-up shirt against the leg wound. \u201cGo,\u201d Sam said, the bearded, burly man\u2019s expression one of barely suppressed rage. \u201cFind them. Get rid of them.\u201d</p><p>Jake knew that Silver Town\u2019s bartender, a gruff man who looked like he lived as a mountain man in the wilderness most of the time, meant for him to go after the two wolves. The others were strictly human. Probably more of Mario\u2019s henchmen. Jake\u2019s men would be targeting them while in their human forms. He would bet Mario was one of the wolves.</p><p>Jake was worried about Sam\u2019s injury, though. The bullet hadn\u2019t been silver or he could have smelled its particular metallic scent. But even so, if the bullet hit a major artery, Sam could bleed out and die before they could get him help.</p><p>\u201cDarien\u2019s sending Doc,\u201d Sam growled. \u201cPeter already called him.\u201d Sam detested being injured like this while everyone else got to hunt down the bastards. \u201cHell, Jake, I mean it. I\u2019m going to live. Quit giving me them puppy-dog eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Jake shook his head and tore off after the scent of the two intruding wolves.</p><p>Peter was the sheriff, and Heston was a new deputy. The rest of the men, even Sam, were deputized whenever they needed to go on a manhunt or wolf hunt. So there wasn\u2019t any need to call in anyone else to apprehend the human bastards. And if they died in the shoot-out, they died. Simple as that. Lawmen had a right to protect themselves. In Silver Town, that\u2019s just what they did.</p><p>As for the wolves...</p><p>Jake was hot on their trail. Or at least one of them.</p><p>He finally discovered the wolf backed up against a pine tree and growling at him. Jake didn\u2019t know if it was Mario or someone else, but he didn\u2019t care. The wolf represented trouble for Alicia and for their kind. If he was ever arrested, and since he was either Mario or one of his men and eventually would be, he couldn\u2019t be allowed to live. Still, Jake couldn\u2019t, with a human conscience, just outright kill without the wolf first attacking.</p><p>They\u2019d figure out something else to do with him, but what, Jake wasn\u2019t sure. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d been glad Darien and Lelandi were the pack leaders. Tom and Jake and others of the pack advised them, but ultimately, decisions of this nature were left up to Darien and Lelandi.</p> <p>The gray wolf continued to snarl and growl at Jake, his nose wrinkled in a hideous display of ferocity, his canines fully exposed, the fur on his back standing on end.</p><p>Another couple of shots were fired off some distance in the woods. Jake wasn\u2019t sure if that prompted the wolf to attack, or if Jake\u2019s failure to look ferocious made the wolf believe Jake was not someone to fear. But the attack came and Jake tore into him, showing the wolf he wasn\u2019t one to mess with as his teeth tore at the wolf\u2019s neck. The villain shook him loose and skittered away with a yelp.</p><p>Then he uttered a low growl right before he dove for Jake for a second time. He wasn\u2019t a skilled wolf at attacking, which meant he probably hadn\u2019t used his wolf instincts in wolf-to-wolf combat much, if ever. Although some instincts would come into play in a fight to the death.</p><p>But the guy was much heavier than Jake, and the damned beast actually knocked him off his feet with the second charge. Adrenaline coursing through his blood, Jake scrambled to get to his feet, knowing he could have been dead meat if the wolf had known how to attack him just right. Not wanting the wolf to learn from his mistakes or to put Jake in too vulnerable a position again, he attacked the bigger wolf this time. But it was like slamming into a damned brick wall. Jake dodged before the wolf could take a bite. The man reminded Jake of a bully with more brute strength than brains.</p><p>The wolf looked pleased, like he was smiling at Jake, and that pissed Jake off. Sure, the guy was a bigger wolf, but he wasn\u2019t going to win this battle. Not with Alicia\u2019s life at stake.</p><p>And with his attack on Jake, the deal was off. The pack leaders wouldn\u2019t decide this guy\u2019s fate. He was Jake\u2019s for the taking.</p><p>Jake lunged at the wolf, going for his throat again. The wolf\u2019s and Jake\u2019s teeth clashed in a wicked snapping of canines. Enamel hit enamel with resounding whacks, snarls ricocheting off the trees like a wolves\u2019 warning to others to stay away. Then like two fighters in the ring, neither of them making any headway, they both fell away.</p><p>Two wolves were out here, Jake reminded himself. Two wolves and he had to get the other also. He had to end this now. Easier said than done as he again attacked and the wolf matched Jake\u2019s skill with more brute force.</p> <p>Jake whipped around in a circle, and before the wolf realized he was attacking again, Jake grabbed him by the throat. The wolf tried to yank away and nearly succeeded. But Jake held on, tightened his grip, and crushed him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait to see what happened next. It didn\u2019t matter whether Mario or the other man lay dead on the ground and would return to his human form. One was still on the loose as a wolf, as far as Jake knew. And his time to locate the bastard was growing short.</p><p>Jake tore off, trying to track the footpad scent of the other wolf who wasn\u2019t part of their pack. That\u2019s when he realized the wolf had gone straight to the damned front door! The shooters were the diversionary force. Damn it!</p><p>Alicia was alone and unprotected.</p><p>Not having time to dress any further, except for putting on the red panties and bra, Alicia dropped her jeans and looked around the bedroom for her purse, not remembering where she\u2019d left it while everyone was still moving furniture. Kitchen? Living room? That\u2019s where her pepper spray and stun gun were tucked away.</p><p>Jake\u2019s gun! But where was it now? After he\u2019d taken it into her apartment to use as protection, she didn\u2019t remember him doing anything with it. Had he returned it to the glove compartment?</p><p>With the sudden rush of footfalls toward the bedroom, it was too late to go for the gun. She raced to the window and had only managed to unlock it when someone barged into the bedroom.</p><p>She whipped around and stared aghast at Mario Constantino. He was naked, tall, and big, but mostly naked. She was so startled at the sight of him in the raw that she didn\u2019t react fast enough. He took two quick strides into the room and struck her in the temple with his meaty fist. A stab of pain shot through her temple before blackness cloaked her and she crumpled to the floor.</p><p>Jake whipped around to the back of the house and slipped through the wolf door, then raced down the hall to the bedroom where he heard someone rummaging around.</p><p>When he peered into the room, he saw a naked-assed Mario Constantino dumping all of Alicia\u2019s things from the boxes onto the floor. Alicia was dead to the world, lying on the bed.</p><p>Jake growled low and threatening. Mario swung around, and Jake swore the bastard was about to have a heart attack. He quickly looked back at Alicia.</p><p>Yeah, you\u2019ll pay, bastard.</p><p>Mario\u2019s mouth dropped open as his attention returned to Jake. \u201cHell, you\u2019re a wolf? The artist?\u201d</p><p>So Mario had thought Alicia had turned into the wolf. That was the reason for him looking back at her on the bed.</p><p>Jake growled even lower, pushing Mario to shape-shift. But the bastard wouldn\u2019t. Maybe he couldn\u2019t. Damn him. Jake couldn\u2019t let him live.</p><p>Jake advanced, still growling, his hackles raised and his posture as menacing as he\u2019d ever been. Angry didn\u2019t begin to describe how he felt about Alicia and the way this bastard had hurt her. Or what Mario planned to do with her in the future, if Jake let him live.</p><p>Mario was scowling and livid, probably because he\u2019d been caught, but he still didn\u2019t shift.</p><p>Jake drew closer, growling, threatening.</p><p>Mario grabbed one of the half-empty boxes and threw it at Jake. He dodged it and turned his focus back on Mario as he shape-shifted into the wolf. Like the other wolf, he was bigger than Jake, but this time Jake wasn\u2019t going to give him time to make the first move.</p><p>He went for the wolf\u2019s throat and sent him crashing into the closet door, but Mario somehow managed to scramble over one of the cardboard boxes and slip away. Relentlessly, Jake went after him again. Jake bit at him, got a mouthful of fur, and broke the skin on Mario\u2019s shoulder. Mario yelped and skittered away. For being a tough bastard as a Mob leader, he was a cowardly wolf.</p><p>He probably felt much more capable with a gun in his hand. Or having others doing his dirty work for him.</p><p>Jake leaped over the cardboard box in his way, and Mario tried to reach the door.</p><p>But there stood Alicia in her red push-up bra and silky red thong, her hand against her temple, unsteady on her feet, her face pale, her expression pained. Mario stopped for an instant. With her free hand, she shut the door, sealing his fate.</p><p>Worried Mario would hurt Alicia, Jake tackled him from behind. Mario whipped around with Jake clinging to his back, holding on with both paws, trying to get a better grip on his neck.</p><p>The voices of men hollering outside caught Jake\u2019s attention, but he remained focused on Mario and bringing him down. He heard the box springs squeak and figured Alicia had collapsed on the bed before she passed out again.</p><p>Mario was still trying to wriggle free, and Jake kept losing his grip on the massive wolf\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jake?\u201d Darien hollered outside the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cIn the house,\u201d Sam shouted back. \u201cHe\u2019s fighting someone as a wolf.\u201d</p><p>Not for long.</p><p>Mario stumbled over a box and got his feet tangled in Alicia\u2019s jeans, and Jake bit him hard in the throat. Killing him. For Alicia. For her mother. For her father. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next day, Alicia\u2019s temple was black and blue from where Mario had struck her. She was seated on the couch in Darien\u2019s home with Jake\u2019s arm around her. Darien, Tom, Lelandi, and Peter offered her moral support as two federal agents sat down to talk with her.</p><p>One was a pretty blond with a short bobbed haircut and a smart black suit-skirt and pretty hazel eyes. The man was dark haired and dark eyed, also wearing a black suit. Both were probably in their early thirties and both professional, yet instead of appearing as though they wanted to grill Alicia, they seemed...</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure. Sympathetic, maybe?</p> <p>That didn\u2019t make any sense to her because she figured they would tie her into Mario\u2019s death and his henchman\u2019s, too. Peter had rounded up the men who had been the diversionary force for Mario at Jake\u2019s home and turned them over to the federal authorities because they\u2019d been involved in killings across state lines, racketeering, money laundering, and even lucrative Medicare scams. But a couple of the men had to heal from their bullet wounds before they appeared in court, Danny being one of them.</p><p>\u201cMiss Greiston,\u201d the woman said, identifying herself as Agent White and the man as Agent Stone, \u201cwe want to commend you for bringing Constantino and his men down.\u201d</p><p>Alicia looked at Jake. He smiled at her and tightened his arm around her shoulder in a warm embrace.</p><p>\u201cYour father, Antonio Frasero, started the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe... was working for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, as an informant. He was working for Constantino, but only to get the goods on him. That little black book you found in your mother\u2019s safe-deposit box? It had all the records we needed to put the whole lot away for life.\u201d</p><p>Again she looked at Jake.</p><p>\u201cI gave it to Peter to give to the authorities,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThe sheriff must have turned it over to the Feds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut helping you got my father killed,\u201d Alicia said to the woman agent.</p><p>\u201cWe gave him a deal. He was working for another crime boss when we caught up with him. We had enough on your father to give him a life sentence for his own crimes. He\u2019d only been married to your mother for a couple of years, and you were not even two years old. They agreed he\u2019d work for us so he\u2019d stay out of prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my mother was dating other men.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly undercover. They were Feds whose job was to make it appear Antonio wasn\u2019t her husband or too close to her while watching out for her. We knew Mario would go after her if he thought Antonio was selling him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich Mario did.\u201d</p><p>The woman took a deep breath and exhaled. \u201cShe loved your father and didn\u2019t want to see anybody else any longer. She wanted to pretend she was Antonio\u2019s lover when she was really his wife. We couldn\u2019t convince them how dangerous it was. Mario must have thought she knew about Antonio\u2019s working with us and had them both murdered. Then you came along. You wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with Antonio, so we figured you were safe. But then when your mother was murdered, you tried to arrest Mario and...\u201d Agent White shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you protect Alicia when you must have known Mario would want her dead?\u201d Jake asked, his voice sounding irritated.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t keep track of her. We put bugs on her car four times, and each time she located them and put them on other vehicles. We bugged her apartment, but she never returned home. She took off from the motel in Breckenridge and vanished. We only learned of it when you had the clerk contact the police to say she had disappeared. We assumed she had vanished on her own and figured she was safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was connected to Ferdinand Massaro\u2019s murder. We learned later that he was informing her as to Mario\u2019s locations. He was one of our informants until something happened. All of a sudden he went rogue. We think it had something to do with Mario trying to have him killed.\u201d</p><p>Agent White cleared her throat and said to Alicia, \u201cIn any event, we just want to say that even though your father started out on the wrong side of the law, he helped to put away several who would have continued their criminal activities by keeping all the records he did. And we have you to thank for handing over the little black book that made it all possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mother was the innocent in all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Agent White said sympathetically. \u201cBut she loved your father and couldn\u2019t give up on him.\u201d</p><p>Alicia understood some of what had gone on while she was growing up. The men who had been her mother\u2019s boyfriends had only been Feds pretending to be something they weren\u2019t. The ones who witnessed her weddings.</p><p>Had her father ever thought she was marrying the wrong men? Her mother hadn\u2019t. She must have thought the guys Alicia had married were good sorts because they didn\u2019t have anything to do with the Mob. But now Alicia understood why her father had wanted to keep his distance from her, probably to keep her safe but also to keep her from learning who he truly was\u2014all about his checkered past. And yet, somewhere deep down, she suspected he wished he could have been the father to her that he might have been, had things been different.</p><p>She cleared her suddenly gravelly throat. \u201cThank you for telling me about my father and mother.\u201d</p><p>Agent Stone stood. \u201cJust for the record, Miss Greiston, Mario Constantino and another of his henchmen were found dead in a ravine over a hundred miles from here by a group of hikers. At least that\u2019s what the anonymous caller told us. Wild animals had eaten most of the remains. But we had enough to positively identify them. The initial coroner\u2019s report stated that they fell off the cliff to their deaths as they were attempting to escape prosecution. If you need anything from us,\u201d he said, pulling a card from his suit pocket, \u201cdon\u2019t hesitate to call.\u201d</p><p>Alicia took the card and smelled a slight scent of wolf. She looked up at the federal agent in disbelief. He gave her a wolfish smile back. But she hadn\u2019t smelled... The air was so still in the room, and with him being such a distance from her...</p><p>She rose and stepped closer to him to shake his hand and took a deeper breath. He was a wolf.</p><p>She looked at the woman, who gave her a conspiratorial wink. They were wolves. Both of them.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Darien said, and led them out of the house as Alicia collapsed on the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d Alicia finally said.</p><p>\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a new beginning.\u201d Jake took her hand in his and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cThey loved each other.\u201d Alicia swallowed hard. \u201cI wish... I wish they could have been here to see me get married.\u201d Then she gave a small smile. \u201cActually I know they will be watching over us as we get married. They\u2019ll always be with us.\u201d</p><p>And with that, she tugged at Jake\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d To the first real home she\u2019d ever known, ready to start her life all over again. Her father might not have been there for her, but Jake would be here for his own children, and that\u2019s all that mattered now. \u201cReady to hang some pictures?\u201d</p><p>Jake smiled back at her. \u201cPictures?\u201d</p><p>The look in his eyes said hanging pictures wasn\u2019t at all what he had in mind.</p><p>That day in the forest so long ago, when Jake had wiped off Alicia\u2019s feet with his good dress shirt before he put her tennis shoes on, had made her feel like Cinderella. And now on their wedding day\u2014since their kind never married like this, he absolutely refused to believe he shouldn\u2019t see her before the wedding\u2014he was helping her into her gown because, as he told her, he wanted to know how to get her back out of it as quickly as possible once the festivities were over.</p><p>She swore he was insatiable. And she loved him for it. But now he knelt at her feet dressed in his tuxedo, looking like the most handsome prince in the world while he slipped one pearl-white shoe onto her foot and then did the same with the other. When he was done, he slid his hands under her gown, up her calves and higher to her thighs, and looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cThis will be the longest day of my life,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cWe\u2019ll sneak off early.\u201d At least she hoped they could.</p><p>The fragrance of flowers perfumed the air in the forest setting as Alicia cried at the wedding. Happy tears. She hadn\u2019t planned to. She blamed it on being pregnant. On being a sentimental sap. On wishing her mother and father could see her truly happy. But even Lelandi joined her with teary eyes, and Darien and Jake just looked at each other sympathetically.</p><p>Silva slapped Sam on the back, his gunshot wound all healed up. \u201cThink we might do something like this someday?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>Lelandi laughed. \u201cI\u2019d be game to put on another one of these.\u201d</p><p>Darien shook his head.</p><p>Everyone glanced at Tom, who was tugging at his cravat. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I haven\u2019t found a girl to date, let alone mate.\u201d</p><p>Lelandi smiled at him, the expression on her face one of calculation. Who could she find for Tom, now that Jake had gone off and found a mate all on his own?</p><p>Everyone was so busy grazing at the tables of food that no one saw Jake take Alicia\u2019s hand and pull her away from the festivities. Or maybe they did, but she was certain no one really minded.</p><p>\u201cWe never discussed going away on a honeymoon,\u201d Jake said, driving Alicia back to the house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his expression surprised.</p><p>\u201cI have trouble with shape-shifting,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAh. But you won\u2019t be able to during the new moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you guarantee it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, running her hand over his thigh. \u201cAfter all that has happened in the past several months, would you think me very boring if I said I\u2019d just like to stay at home with you? Take walks in the woods where you can show me where you\u2019ve taken such beautiful pictures of wildflowers. Enjoy a fire and hot chocolate with whipped cream and whatever else we have in mind to occupy ourselves.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSkinny-dip on a night when the moon shimmers in the night sky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned doing that before. Sounds like fun. Have any drive-in theaters around here?\u201d she asked, as he drove down their long wooded drive.</p><p>\u201cForty-five minutes from here in Green Valley.\u201d</p> <p>She smiled. \u201cLooks like we have the start of a wonderfully delightful honeymoon scheduled, right here at home.\u201d</p><p>Home. It was home. And she had a man she could love just like her mother had loved her father. And a whole new family who loved her just as much as she loved them back.</p><p>And a whole mess of babies that would be here before they knew it. Triplets. She shook her head and cuddled next to Jake, her gown making her feel like she was cocooned in satin like a fairy princess. He wrapped his arm around her as they pulled into their driveway.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking now?\u201d Jake asked, kissing the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cWhen I first saw you, I thought you were one handsome, dangerously devilish man.\u201d She rubbed her belly. \u201cBoy, did I have that right.\u201d</p> <p>He chuckled, parked the truck, and carried her out of the vehicle. \u201cI wanted to kiss you in the worst way. And that was my undoing.\u201d</p><p>And the beginning of his life. He sighed, carried his mate and bride across the threshold, and vowed to give her the honeymoon of a lifetime, right here close to home. He would take pictures of her among the wildflowers, her hair freely flowing over her shoulders while she wore a tank top and short shorts, braless, barefoot, and pregnant, just as he\u2019d envisioned so many weeks ago\u2014except for the triplets part. And he couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the way the picture had changed. </p> </body></html>"]
