In Lady Roberta St. Giles\u2019s case, the evidence was all too clear\u2014as was her lack of suitors.</p> <p>The cartoon reproduced in Rambler\u2019s Magazine depicted Lady Roberta with a hunched back and a single brow across her bulging forehead. Her father knelt beside her, imploring passersby to find him a respectable spouse for his daughter.</p><p>At least that part was true. Her father had fallen to his knees in the streets of Bath, precisely as depicted. To Roberta\u2019s mind, the Rambler\u2019s label of Mad Marquess had a certain accuracy about it as well.</p><p>\u201cInbreeding,\u201d her father had said, when she flourished the magazine at him. \u201cThey assume your physique is affected by the sort of inbreeding that produces these characteristics. Interesting! After all, you could have been dangerously mad, for example, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Papa,\u201d she wailed, \u201ccouldn\u2019t you make them print a retraction? I am not misshapen. Who would wish to marry me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Sweetpea, you are entirely lovely,\u201d he said, knitting his brow. \u201cI shall write a paean on your beauty and publish it in Rambler\u2019s. I will explain precisely why I was so distraught, and include a commentary about the practices of hardened rakehells!\u201d</p> <p>Rambler\u2019s Magazine printed the marquess\u2019s 818 lines of reproving verse, describing the nefarious gallant who had kissed Roberta in public without so much as a by-your-leave. They resurrected the offensive print as well. Buried somewhere in the marquess\u2019s raging stanzas describing the peril of walking Bath\u2019s streets was a description of his daughter: \u201cTell the blythe Graces as they bound, luxuriant in the buxom round, that they\u2019re not more elegantly free, than Roberta, only daughter of a Marquess!\u201d In vain did Roberta point out that \u201celegantly free\u201d said little of the condition of her back, and that \u201cbuxom round\u201d made her sound rather plump.</p><p>\u201cIt implies all that needs to be said,\u201d the marquess said serenely. \u201cEvery man of sense will immediately ascertain that you have a charmingly luxurious figure, elegant features and a good dowry, not to mention your expectations from me. I cleverly pointed to your inheritance, do you see?\u201d</p><p>All Roberta could see was a line declaring that her dowry was a peach tree.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for the rhyme,\u201d her father had said, looking a bit cross now. \u201cDowry doesn\u2019t rhyme with many words, so I had to rhyme dowry and peach tree. The tree is obviously a synecdoche.\u201d</p><p>When Roberta looked blank, he added impatiently, \u201cA figure of speech in which something small stands for the whole. The whole is the estate of Wharton and Malmesbury, and you know perfectly well that we have at least eleven peach trees. My nephew will inherit the estate, but the orchards are unentailed and will go to you.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps there were clever men who deduced from the marquess\u2019s poem that his daughter had eleven peach trees and a slender figure, but not a single one of those men turned up in Wiltshire to ascertain for himself. The fact that the original cartoon remained on display in the windows of Humphrey\u2019s Print Shop for many months may also have been a consideration.</p> <p>But since the marquess refused to undertake another trip to the city wherein his daughter was accosted\u2014\u201cYou\u2019ll thank me for that later,\u201d he added, rather obscurely\u2014Lady Roberta St. Giles found herself heading quickly toward that undesirable stage of life known as \u201cold maid.\u201d</p><p>Two years passed. Every few months Roberta\u2019s future would pass before her eyes, a life spent copying and cataloging her father\u2019s poems, when not alphabetizing rejection letters from publishers for use by the marquess\u2019s future biographers, and she would rebel. In vain did she reason, implore or cry. Even threatening to burn every poem in the house had no effect; it wasn\u2019t until she snatched a copy of \u201cFor the Custards Mary Brought Me\u201d and threw it in the fire that her father understood her seriousness.</p><p>And only by withholding the single remaining copy of the Custard poem did she gain permission to attend the New Year\u2019s ball being held by Lady Cholmondelay.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to stay overnight,\u201d her father said, his lower lip jutting out with disapproval.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go by ourselves,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cWithout Mrs. Grope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout Mrs. Grope!\u201d He opened his mouth to bellow, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cPapa, you do want me to have some attention, don\u2019t you? Mrs. Grope will cast me entirely in the shade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI shall need a new dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent thought. I was in the village the other day and one of Mrs. Parthnell\u2019s children was running about the square looking blue with cold. I\u2019ve no doubt but that she could use your custom.\u201d</p><p>She barely opened her mouth before he lifted his hand. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want a gown from some other mantuamaker, dearest. You\u2019re not thinking of poor Mrs. Parthnell and her eight children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am thinking,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cof Mrs. Parthnell\u2019s bungled bodices.\u201d</p><p>But her father frowned at that, since he had strong views about the shallow nature of fashion and even stronger views about supporting the villagers, no matter how inferior their products.</p><p>Unfortunately, the New Year\u2019s ball produced no suitors.</p><p>Papa could not forbear from bringing Mrs. Grope\u2014\u201c\u2019Twill hurt her feelings too much, my dear\u201d\u2014and consequently, Roberta spent the evening watching revelers titter at the presence of a notorious strumpet amongst them. No one appeared to be interested in whether the Mad Marquess\u2019s daughter had a humped back or not; they were too busy peering at the Mad Marquess\u2019s courtesan. Their hostess was incensed at her father\u2019s rudeness in bringing his ch\u00e8re-amie to her ball, and wasted none of her precious time introducing Roberta to young men.</p><p>Her father danced with Mrs. Grope; Roberta sat at the side of the room and watched. Mrs. Grope\u2019s hair was adorned with ribbons, feathers, flowers, jewels and a bird made from papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. This made it easy for Roberta to pretend that she didn\u2019t know her own parent; when the said plumage headed in her direction, Roberta would slip away for a brisk stroll. She visited the ladies\u2019 retiring room so many times that the company likely thought she had a female complaint to match her invisible hump.</p><p>Around eleven o\u2019clock, a gentleman finally asked her to dance. But he turned out to be Lady Cholmondelay\u2019s curate, and he immediately launched into a confused lecture to do with notorious strumpets. He seemed to be equating Mrs. Grope to Mary Magdalene, but the dance kept separating them before Roberta could grasp the connection.</p><p>Unfortunately, they came face-to-face with the marquess and Mrs. Grope just when the curate was detailing his feelings about trollops.</p><p>\u201cI take your meaning, sirrah, and Mrs. Grope is no trollop!\u201d the marquess snapped. Roberta\u2019s heart sank and she tried vainly to turn her partner in the opposite direction.</p><p>But the plump little pigeon of a man dug in his heels, squared his shoulders and retorted, \u201cMuse upon my comments at your leisure, or woe betide your eternal soul!\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the immediate vicinity stopped dancing, grasping that a more interesting performance had begun. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The marquess did not disappoint them. \u201cMrs. Grope is a lovely woman, kind enough to accept my adoration,\u201d Roberta\u2019s father roared, loud enough so that no one in the room could miss a word. \u201cShe is no more a trollop than is my own daughter, the treasure of my house!\u201d</p><p>Predictably, the crowd turned as one to examine the signs of trollopdom, the first interest shown Roberta all evening. With a gasp, she fled back to the ladies\u2019 retiring room.</p><p>Within a half hour, Roberta made several important decisions. The first was that she\u2019d had enough humiliation. She wanted a husband who would never, under any circumstances, make a public display of himself or those around him. And he should know nothing of poetry. Second, her only chance of finding that husband was to make her way to London without her father or Mrs. Grope. She would go there, pick an appropriate gentleman and arrange to marry him. Somehow.</p><p>She returned to her seat in the corner with renewed interest and began surveying the company for the appropriate characteristics.</p> <p>\u201cWho is that gentleman?\u201d she asked a passing footman, who had given her a few pitying glances during the evening.</p><p>He said, \u201cWhich one, Miss?\u201d He had a nice smile and looked as if his wig itched.</p><p>\u201cThe man in the green coat.\u201d To call it green was faint praise: it was a pale, pale green, embroidered with black flowers. It was the most exquisite garment she had ever seen. The man was tall and moved with the careless grace of an athlete. He wore no wig, unlike the other perspiring gentlemen pacing through the dance. His hair was a rumpled black, shot with two or three brilliant streaks of white, and tied at his neck with a pale green ribbon. He was a dangerous mixture of carelessness and supreme elegance.</p><p>The footman handed her a glass in order to disguise the fact they were speaking. \u201cThat\u2019s His Grace, the Duke of Villiers. He plays chess. Hadn\u2019t you heard of him then?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and took the glass.</p> <p>\u201cThey do say he\u2019s the best for chess in England,\u201d the footman said. He leaned a bit closer and said, eyes dancing, \u201cLady Cholmondelay thinks he\u2019s the best at sport, if you\u2019ll forgive my presumption.\u201d</p><p>A snort of laughter escaped Roberta\u2019s mouth before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched you this eve,\u201d he said. \u201cTapping your foot. We\u2019ve our own ball below stairs. And it seems no one knows you here. Why don\u2019t you come back there and dance a round with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t! Someone would\u2014\u201d She looked around. The room was crowded with laughing, dancing peers. No one had paid any attention to her, or even spoken to her in over an hour. Her papa had wandered off again with Mrs. Grope, content to think that she was \u201chunting prey,\u201d as he put it in the carriage.</p><p>\u201cBelow stairs, they won\u2019t know you\u2019re a lady,\u201d the footman said, \u201cnot in that dress, miss. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re a lady\u2019s maid. At least that way you can have a dance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>For the first time all evening, young men bowed before her. She invented an irascible mistress and had great fun describing her tribulations dressing her. She danced twice with \u201cher\u201d footman and separately with three more. Finally, she realized that there was a remote possibility that her father would miss her, and she headed back to the ball.</p><p>Then she realized there was also the possibility that he would have forgotten about her and left for the inn.</p><p>She ran down the corridor, slammed open the baize door that marked the servants\u2019 quarters\u2014and knocked over the Duke of Villiers.</p><p>He stared at her from the ground, with eyes as cold as spring rainfall. Then he said without stirring, in a husky, drawling voice that made her shiver all over, \u201cYou must tell the butler to train you in proper behavior.\u201d</p><p>She blushed and dropped a curtsy, dazed by the pure raw masculinity of him, by his hollowed cheeks and jaded look. He was everything that her father was not. There wasn\u2019t an ounce of sentiment in him. A man like that would never embarrass himself.</p><p>Life with her father had taught her to be blunt about her own emotions, or risk having them dissected by a poet. So she knew instantly what it was she felt: lust. Her father\u2019s poetry on the subject filtered through her mind, confirming her sense.</p><p>He stood and then tipped up her chin. \u201cAn astonishing beauty to find in such a dim squirrel\u2019s hole as the servants\u2019 quarters.\u201d</p><p>Roberta felt a thrill of triumph. Apparently he didn\u2019t think that she had a beetle brow or a humped back. The lust was mutual. \u201cAh\u2014\u201d she said, trying to think what to say other than a blunt proposal.</p> <p>\u201cRed hair,\u201d he said, rather dreamily. \u201cExtraordinary high arches of eyebrows, slightly tilted eyes. A deep ruby for a lower lip. I could paint you in water colors.\u201d</p><p>His catalog raised Roberta\u2019s hackles a little; she felt like a horse he was considering for purchase. \u201cI should prefer not to look blurry; could you not manage oils?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo maid\u2019s apron, and the voice of a lady. I fear I misjudged your station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I am rejoining my family in the ballroom.\u201d</p><p>His eyes skittered over the plain laced front of her gown, with its misshapen pleats that looked as if she had fashioned them herself.</p><p>He dropped his hand. \u201cThat makes you altogether more delectable and forbidden fare, an impoverished noble-woman. I would have you without delay if you had but a few pennies to your name, my dear, but even I have a few paltry morals. Foibles, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assume a great deal,\u201d she said. She meant that he was assuming she was poor, although the supposition was fair enough, given her clothing. But he jumped to the more obvious meaning.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis true you might not have me. Though I\u2019ll tell you the secret to my success with women, and I won\u2019t charge you ha\u2019pence since you haven\u2019t an extra one to your purse.\u201d</p><p>She waited, cataloging the sheen of his coat and the rumpled perfection of his hair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really give a damn whether I have you or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shan\u2019t have me,\u201d she said, stung. \u201cBecause I feel precisely the same way about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I will kiss your fingertips and retire.\u201d</p><p>As he made a leg before her, she watched the skirts of his coat fall into perfect pleats. Not for nothing was she a wordsmith\u2019s daughter. Pale green wasn\u2019t descriptive enough; the silk taffeta of his coat was celadon, the green of new leaves. And its black embroidery, on close inspection, was mulberry-colored.</p><p>It was an exquisite combination. Enough to change her mind entirely. What she felt was entirely too deep for a flimsy emotion such as lust.</p><p>What she felt wasn\u2019t lust\u2014it was love. For the first time in her life...she was in love.</p><p>In love!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to London,\u201d she told her father once they were home again. \u201cMy heart is in chains and I must follow its call.\u201d Though such extravagant language was definitely not Roberta\u2019s chosen mode of expression, she felt that quoting one of her father\u2019s poems was a sound precaution.</p><p>\u201cYou most certainly are not!\u201d he said, ignoring her literary reference. \u201cI will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd without Mrs. Grope.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d</p><p>They battled on for a month or so until the March edition of Rambler\u2019s Magazine arrived in the post.</p><p>These etchings were no more accurate than those of two years earlier. She was humped-backed and fiercely browed, on her knees before a man in livery, presumably praying for the footman\u2019s hand in marriage. \u201cLike father, like daughter,\u201d the inscription read. \u201cWe always suspected that desperation was hereditary.\u201d</p><p>Roberta had no doubt that the image was selling briskly in Humphrey\u2019s Print Shop.</p> <p>\u201cMy conscience is clear!\u201d her father bellowed, once he understood the reference. \u201cSurely you could have guessed that servants are in the pay of gossip rags? How could you not, given the fact that Mrs. Grope and myself make such frequent appearances in Town and Country? Someone made a pretty penny from your folly. It\u2019s no good begging me to write another poem; the powers of my literature would be of no avail.\u201d</p><p>The marquess\u2019s rage was assuaged only after writing four hundred lines of iambic pentameter rhyming \u201cserpent\u2019s tooth\u201d and \u201cdaughter,\u201d which is no easy feat.</p><p>His daughter\u2019s distress was diminished only by repeating to herself that she was going to marry the Duke of Villiers, order clothes of celadon silk and never listen to another poem again in her life.</p><p>She commandeered her father\u2019s second-best coach and the second housemaid to accompany her to London and left, clutching a valise filled with Mrs. Parthnell\u2019s unsightly clothing, a measured sum of money and a poem from her father, which was the only introduction he would vouchsafe her.</p><p>\u201cOh, brave new world!\u201d she whispered to herself. And then wrinkled her nose. No more poetry. The Duke of Villiers had likely never heard of John Donne and probably couldn\u2019t tell a roundelay from a rickshaw.</p> <p>He was perfect.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>April 10, 1783</p><p>Beaumont House, Kensington</p><p>\u201cI n Paris, a married lady must have a lover or she is an unknown. And she may be pardoned two.\u201d The door to the drawing room swung open, but the young woman sitting with her back to the door took no notice.</p><p>\u201cTwo?\u201d an exquisitely dressed young man remarked. \u201cI gather that Frenchmen are a happy race of men. They seemed so petulant to me when I was last there. It must be the embarrassment of riches, like having three custards after supper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree lovers are considered rather too many,\u201d the woman replied. \u201cAlthough I have known some who considered three to be a privilege rather than an abundance.\u201d Her low laugh was a type that tickled a man\u2019s breastbone and even lower. It said volumes about her personal abilities to manage one\u2014or three\u2014Frenchmen with aplomb.</p><p>Her husband closed the door behind him and stepped into the room.</p><p>The young man glanced up and came to his feet, bowing without extraordinary haste. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Corbin,\u201d the Duke of Beaumont replied, bowing. Corbin was just to Jemma\u2019s taste: elegant, assured and far more intelligent than he admitted. In fact, he would make a good man in parliament, not that Corbin would lower himself to something approaching work.</p><p>His brother-in-law, the Earl of Gryffyn, rose and made him a casual bow.</p><p>\u201cYour servant, Gryffyn,\u201d the duke said, making a leg.</p><p>\u201cDo join us, Beaumont,\u201d his wife said, looking up at him with an expression of the utmost friendliness. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to see you. Is the House of Lords not meeting today?\u201d That was part and parcel with the war they had waged for the last eight years: conversation embroidered with delicate barbs, rarely with coarse emotion.</p><p>\u201cIt is in session, but I thought to spend some time with you. After all, you have barely returned from Paris.\u201d The duke bared his teeth in an approximation of a smile.</p> <p>\u201cI miss it already,\u201d Jemma said, with a lavish sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous that you\u2019re here, darling,\u201d she said, leaning forward a bit and tapping him on the hand with her fan. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for Harriet, the Duchess of Berrow, to arrive. And then we shall make a decision about the centerpiece for tomorrow\u2019s f\u00eate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFowle tells me that we are holding a ball.\u201d The duke\u2014who thought of himself as Elijah, though he would be very affronted were any person to address him so\u2014kept his voice even. Those years of parliamentary debate were going to prove useful, now that Jemma had returned to London. \u2019Twas the reason he\u2019d stayed home for the day, if truth be told. He had to strike a bargain with his wife that would curb her activities to an acceptable level. And he wouldn\u2019t get there by losing his temper; he remembered their newlywed battles well enough.</p><p>\u201cDear me, don\u2019t tell me that I forgot to inform you! I know it\u2019s a bit mad, but the plans gave me something to do on the voyage here.\u201d</p><p>She looked genuinely repentant, and indeed, for all Elijah knew, she was. The game of marriage they played required strictly friendly manners in public. Not that they were ever in private.</p><p>\u201cHe just did tell you that,\u201d her brother put in. \u201cYou\u2019d better watch out, Sis. You\u2019re not used to sharing a household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was truly ill-mannered of me,\u201d she said, leaping to her feet, which made her silk petticoats swirl around her narrow ankles. She was dressed in a pale blue gown \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, embroidered all over with forget-me-nots. Her bodice caressed every curve of her breasts and narrow waist before the skirts billowed over her panniers.</p><p>By all rights, the way her side hoops concealed the swell of her hips should be distasteful to a man, and yet Elijah had to admit that they played an irresistible part in a man\u2019s imagination, leading the eye from the curve of a breast to the narrow waist, and then driving him perforce to imagine slender limbs and\u2014and the rest of it.</p><p>Jemma held out her hand; Elijah paused for a moment and then took it. She smiled at him, as a mother might smile at a little boy reluctant to wash his face. \u201cI am so glad that you are able to join us this morning, Beaumont. While I trust that these gentlemen have impeccable opinions\u201d\u2014she cast a glimmering smile at Corbin\u2014\u201cone\u2019s husband\u2019s opinion must, of course, prevail. I do declare that it\u2019s been so long since I felt as if I had a husband that it is quite a novelty! I shall probably bore you to tears asking you to approve my ribbons.\u201d</p><p>In the old days, the first days of their marriage, Elijah would have bristled. But he was seasoned by years of dedicated jousting in Parliament where the stakes were more important than ribbons and trifles. \u201cI am quite certain that Corbin can do my duty with your ribbons.\u201d He said it with just the right amount of disinterest and courtesy in his voice.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, Elijah noticed that Corbin didn\u2019t even blink at the idea he had just been invited by a duke to do his husbandly duty. Perhaps the man could keep Jemma occupied enough that she wouldn\u2019t cause too many scandals before parliament went into recess. He turned sharply toward the door, annoyed to discover that his wife\u2019s beauty seemed more potent in his own house than it had been in Paris during his rare visits.</p><p>Partly it was because Jemma had not powdered her hair. She knew quite well that the shimmer of weathered gold was far more enticing than powder, and contrasted better with her blue eyes. It was only\u2014he told himself\u2014because she was his wife that he felt this prickling irritation at her beauty. Or perhaps the irritation was caused by her self-possession. When they first married, she wasn\u2019t so flawless. Now everything about her was polished to perfection, from the color of her lip to the witty edge of her comments. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Those blue eyes of hers widened just slightly, and she cast him another of her glimmering smiles. \u201cWe really are two hearts that beat as one, Beaumont,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d her brother said, \u201cit is truly odd that you have spent so much time apart. Not to break up this touching example at marital felicity\u2014so rare in our depraved age and, I think we\u2019ll all agree, an inspiration to us all\u2014but can you just show us the damned centerpiece now, Jemma? I\u2019ve got an appointment on Bond Street, and your friend the duchess doesn\u2019t seem to be making an appearance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the next room, if Caro has everything prepared. She wasn\u2019t quite ready when you arrived.\u201d</p><p>Elijah caught himself before asking who Caro was.</p> <p>Jemma was still speaking. \u201cI trust her with everything. She has the most elegant eye of any female I\u2019ve ever known. Except, perhaps, Her Majesty, Queen Marie Antoinette.\u201d</p><p>Elijah shot his wife a look that showed exactly what he felt about those who boasted of intimacy with French royalty. \u201cShall we examine this centerpiece, sirs?\u201d he said, turning to Corbin and Gryffyn. \u201cThe duchess is considered quite a leader of fashion in Paris. I myself shall never forget her masquerade ball of \u201979.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you there?\u201d Jemma asked wonderingly. \u201cI vow, I had quite forgotten.\u201d She tapped him on the arm with her fan. \u201cNow it comes back to me. All the men were dressed as satyrs\u2014\u2019twas most ravishingly amusing\u2014but you wore black and white, for all the world like a parliamentary penguin.\u201d</p><p>He dropped her hand, so that he could bow again. \u201cAlas, I do not show to best advantage with a satyr\u2019s tail.\u201d And neither did the asses of Frenchmen, though he didn\u2019t say it aloud.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cBoth members of my family declined to join the fun. So English\u2014so pompous\u2014so\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo clothed,\u201d Gryffyn said. \u201cThere were some knees in evidence that night that should never have seen the light of day. I still have trouble forgetting Le Comte d\u2019Auvergne\u2019s bony knobs.\u201d</p><p>Jemma peeked through the doors to the ballroom beyond. Then she laughed and flung them open. \u201cHow wonderful it all looks, Caro! You are brilliant, absolutely brilliant, as always!\u201d</p><p>Corbin was briskly following in Jemma\u2019s train, so Elijah grabbed his brother-in-law\u2019s elbow. \u201cWho the hell is Caro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPestilently intelligent woman,\u201d Gryffyn said. \u201cJemma\u2019s secretary. She\u2019s been around for four or five years. You haven\u2019t encountered her?\u201d</p><p>And, at Elijah\u2019s shrug, \u201cShe prepares Jemma\u2019s most extravagant escapades. Accomplices in scandal, that\u2019s the way to describe them. Prepare to be dazzled by her incomparable abilities, not that you\u2019ll appreciate them. I don\u2019t suppose that you\u2019re secretly hoping that Jemma will transform into a political wife, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hope is limited to a wish that she doesn\u2019t topple my career,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cDo I understand you to say that all of Jemma\u2019s secretary\u2019s abilities are directed to the creation of scandal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs I said, you won\u2019t like it,\u201d Gryffyn said. They were at the door. He pulled it farther open and moved to the side. \u201cThis is pretty standard for her.\u201d</p><p>Elijah walked through the door and stopped short.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than those satyrs. No tail,\u201d Gryffyn pointed out.</p><p>As Elijah stared into the room, he felt his hard-won calm and control slipping from his grasp. The huge mahogany table that generally stood in the dining room had been removed to the middle of the ballroom. Rather than dishes, it held an enormous pink shell, apparently made of clay. Rosebuds were strewn all about, falling in chains to the floor. Numbly he noticed that Jemma was exclaiming over how realistic the flowers appeared. \u201cAnd the sea shells!\u201d she squealed. \u201cA beautiful touch, Caro!\u201d</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t it, of course.</p><p>What was making his heart thud against the wall of his chest wasn\u2019t the hundreds of pounds worth of fabric flowers, nor the shell, nor even the pearls, because there were also strings and strings of pearls. God knows, he had more than enough money for whatever extravagances Jemma came up with. What Elijah treasured more than anything else in the world was his stock of carefully nourished, tenderly used, political power.</p><p>He had nurtured it day by day. Built up a solid reputation for energetic, thoughtful argument. While his wife lived in Paris for the last eight years, he built a career without the help that other men got from their wives throwing dinner parties, or hosting salons. He\u2019d come to the top of the House of Lords, to one of the most respected positions in the kingdom, by marshalling his intellect, never taking a bribe. Separating himself from the corrupt policies and wild scandals that plagued Fox and the Prince of Wales\u2019s disgraceful cronies.</p> <p>And now, when he might have only a little time left to further his work\u2014</p><p>The centerpiece wasn\u2019t wearing a damned scrap of clothing.</p><p>And she was painted gold; never mind the pearls that were glued around her body at regular intervals.</p><p>His brother-in-law was watching her with a calculated, lustful look in his eye that Elijah despised, though he had to admit that only a dead man would ignore this centerpiece.</p><p>\u201cAt least she\u2019s not wearing a tail,\u201d Gryffyn commented.</p><p>At that very moment, the naked, gold-painted young lady bent sideways and fiddled with the little stand on which she was leaning. A huge spray of gorgeous peacock feathers burst from behind her beautifully curved rear.</p><p>\u201cSpoke too soon,\u201d Gryffyn said happily.</p><p>\u201cDamn it to hell,\u201d Elijah breathed.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>R oberta entered the room just as the peacock tail sprang into view. About to announce her presence, the butler froze, mouth open. She patted his arm. \u201cI\u2019ll announce myself,\u201d she told him. \u201cMy cousin is expecting me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and backed out of the room.</p><p>That was a stroke of luck, given that her cousin was not expecting her. In truth, the Duchess of Beaumont likely didn\u2019t even know she existed.</p><p>The duchess was much more beautiful than the sketches Roberta had seen in Town and Country Magazine. Her hair was tumbled into a sophisticated mass of curls, and her clothes were exquisite. In fact, she looked rather like portraits of Roberta\u2019s mother, with perfectly balanced features and deep crimson lips. But of course the duchess had a potent combination of elegance and sensual appeal that Roberta doubted her mother, buried deep in the country with a husband whom the charitable labeled eccentric, had ever possessed.</p><p>Roberta walked forward, but no one noticed her. There were two gentlemen standing by the table, gawking up at the naked woman. One had to suppose she was used to the attention, because she was smiling at them most genially. In fact, she reminded Roberta of nothing so much as a toothy crocodile, if crocodiles were endowed with large, fleshy bosoms.</p><p>The only gentleman not staring at the goddess was glowering at the duchess. He had to be the duke. Beaumont was often illustrated holding the reins of government or whipping members of the House. He looked powerful, with a sort of furious elegance.</p><p>\u201cOne of the points I should like to make,\u201d he said with icy forcefulness, \u201cis that this preposterously tailed young woman may well destroy my career. She will undoubtedly create an interesting evening, but have you given a thought to proprieties? I count among my important acquaintances a good many people with young, unmarried daughters. After one peek at this spectacle, they will never darken the door of my house again!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The duchess seemed unmoved. \u201cI assure you that no one in Lords will be other than amused by my centerpiece, Beaumont. My absence has had no effect on your ability to garner support, and neither will my presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently your years in Paris have had no effect on your intelligence,\u201d the duke snarled. Roberta took a tentative step backward. She wanted no part in a marital quarrel.</p><p>\u201cApparently your manners declined in the same period; what a pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right, Jemma. You\u2019re being na\u00efve,\u201d another gentleman said, tearing his eyes away from the naked centerpiece. He looked so much like the duchess that he must be her brother, Lord Gryffyn, and therefore Roberta\u2019s cousin (once, or twice, or\u2014if one is punctilious\u2014twelve times removed). The eyebrows were darker, but his carelessly tied-back hair was the color of brandy. They had the same cherry mouth, though he had none of his sister\u2019s flawless perfection. His coat was a nice steel blue, but looked as if he pulled it on without thinking, as his waistcoat was an odd orange.</p> <p>\u201cI would guess that this particular Venus will offend the female half of the ton,\u201d Lord Gryffyn was saying.</p><p>\u201cShe is not Venus, but Neptune\u2019s Queen,\u201d a lady standing to the side put in. \u201cVenus was a tired concept five years ago!\u201d She curled her lip with such emphasis that she had to be French.</p><p>\u201cAh, but this isn\u2019t Paris,\u201d Lord Gryffyn said. \u201cWe\u2019re of tender stock, and we like to pretend that we don\u2019t know what various body parts look like. At this rate, Mademoiselle Caro, you will single-handedly instruct the better part of London on the composition of a beautiful pair of thighs. It\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour own brother agrees with me,\u201d the duke snapped. \u201cI will not have this sort of behavior in my house.\u201d</p><p>There was a freezing moment of silence. The cheerful smile dropped from the duchess\u2019s eyes. \u201cWon\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>The duke had to be six feet tall, but to Roberta he looked at least seven. \u201cI will not.\u201d He spaced his words in an ominous fashion.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I suppose I shall not be the one to educate the English on the delicate matter of a woman\u2019s leg,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cNot when you\u2019re there to do it for me, and in your own offices in Westminster.\u201d</p><p>Roberta blinked, but the duchess was turning away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s damned hard to imagine Jemma as a political wife,\u201d Lord Gryffyn remarked to Beaumont. \u201cDo naked women grace tables in Paris? I\u2019ve never seen one in London.\u201d He checked himself. \u201cWell, not in this kind of house anyway.\u201d</p><p>He looked up and met Roberta\u2019s eyes. She involuntarily fell back another step. How could she possibly\u2014</p><p>\u201cLooks like you have a visitor, Jemma,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Jemma swung around, and so did the duke. The third gentleman was still deep in conversation with Neptune\u2019s queen and didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Roberta dropped a curtsy. \u201cGood afternoon,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid your butler was overcome by the event and retired to compose himself. I told him I would introduce myself.\u201d</p><p>The duchess smiled at her. Roberta was suddenly aware of her large feet. She even felt as if her overstuffed, shabby bag, dropped in the foyer by a disdainful footman, was humping along behind her.</p><p>\u201cPlease forgive us for being in such disarray,\u201d the duchess said, a wave of her hand signifying (one must assume) the naked woman and the squabble with her husband.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Roberta said, stammering. \u201cMy name is Lady Roberta St. Giles.\u201d She paused.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a spark of recognition on the duchess\u2019s face, but the duke stepped forward. \u201cI recognize the name, madam.\u201d</p><p>Roberta breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re collecting for the Chelsea pensioners, are you not? It was most kind of you to attend me here, but I assure you, quite unnecessary.\u201d He came forward with determined kindness, clearly intending to sweep her out of the house. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you were present at a scene like this. It\u2019s enough to horrify any woman of delicate sensibility.\u201d</p> <p>The duchess intervened. \u201cIf I am to be a political wife, Beaumont, I might as well begin. I gather that charity, rather than peacock feathers, should be my every thought.\u201d She tucked Roberta\u2019s arm under her own. \u201cChelsea pensioners are a most worthy charity, Lady Roberta,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d be honored to hear about your work. Would you like a cup of tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Roberta said, holding her ground. But when she opened her mouth, she could not bring herself to tell the truth. That everything she owned was drooping in the entryway. That she had come\u2014unannounced and undoubtedly unwelcome\u2014to stay. To find a husband.</p><p>Without another look at her husband or her guests, the duchess began drawing her toward the door. \u201cPlease come to my sitting room,\u201d she said. \u201cBeaumont, do you make my farewells.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at him as she said it.</p><p>The duke\u2019s voice was icy. \u201cAnd your centerpiece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall discuss it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no reason to waste my time. A naked woman will never grace my dining table. That is all I have to say about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPish on that!\u201d the duchess cried, stopping in her tracks and dropping Roberta\u2019s arm. \u201cShe\u2019s a work of art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d he countered.</p><p>The duchess showed no outward signs of fear, which Roberta thought was amazing. Faced with such a large specimen of enraged manhood, she herself would have quailed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose this one,\u201d Lord Gryffyn said cheerfully. \u201cBelieve it or not, Jemma, your husband is up to good works that shouldn\u2019t get mucked up by your naked ladies, no matter how luscious. What do you think?\u201d he asked Roberta. \u201cYou\u2019re obviously a proper young lady. Would you think that a ball featuring Lady Neptune would be ill-received?\u201d</p><p>Roberta glanced up at the centerpiece. She truly was naked: it was rather interesting how different her body was from Roberta\u2019s. For one thing, her breasts had to be three times as large. \u201cI believe that most people will find it unhygienic,\u201d she said. \u201cI gather that is your dining table? There\u2019s a chance that people might hesitate to dine here in the future.\u201d</p><p>Her comment was met with flat silence, and then a bellow of laughter from the duchess\u2019s brother. \u201cShe\u2019s got you there, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>The duke smiled, and Roberta suddenly felt the power of his rather icy face when it melted into a smile. \u201cI am feeling very prone to helping pensioners,\u201d he said softly. \u201cOne good deed, etc.\u201d</p><p>The duchess gave a wry little shrug, and then turned around and called to the Frenchwoman. \u201cCaro, darling, she needs to be clothed. Could you fashion her something appropriate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you jest!\u201d she replied, throwing her hand to her brow. \u201cDo you conceive of the diaper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it covers her from collarbone to ankle,\u201d the duke stated. The woman broke into remonstrations, waving her arms in the air.</p><p>\u201cNow I really need a cup of tea,\u201d the duchess muttered, taking Roberta\u2019s elbow again. \u201cShall we go to my sitting room? It\u2019s cowardly of me to leave Beaumont with my secretary, but he deserves it, don\u2019t you think? I promise not to be petulant about Lady Neptune\u2019s nappy.\u201d Lord Gryffyn had turned away; the secretary\u2019s voice was escalating into a shriek. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps Mademoiselle Caro will be able to bend her designs to the tender sensibilities of English gentlewomen,\u201d Roberta suggested, feeling quite certain that most of the Frenchwoman\u2019s designs would terrify and amaze the ladies of her acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cAnd perhaps not. Then she will leave me and return to Paris, where at least three comtesses are slavering for her services. I\u2019ve had to double her wage twice in the last few years. Which is a frightfully shallow thing to admit when you\u2019ve called on such a serious business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as to that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, let\u2019s not talk of sad subjects until we\u2019re seated with a cup of tea. I would ring for claret; I always think that claret is a sustaining drink for unpleasant subjects, but it\u2019s too early.\u201d</p> <p>They walked into a small sitting room. \u201cI must have this redone,\u201d the duchess said, pausing a moment. \u201cI\u2019ve only come from Paris a day or so ago, or I assure you that I wouldn\u2019t bring you into such a shabby place.\u201d</p><p>The room did have a rather forbidding aspect. It was painted a drab mustard color and featured a large picture of a smiling young woman holding a severed head by its hair. \u201cJust look at her,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cShe carries that head with all the jaunty air of a tavern maid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be Judith and Holofernes,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cUnder the circumstances, Judith looks rather cheerful, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>The duchess strolled over to the picture. \u201cActually, I think she looks rather drunk. Don\u2019t you think she looks tipsy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that Judith first brought Holofernes some wine,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cBefore she took off his head. Though I would hate to cast disparagements on the artist\u2019s skill, her drunken aspect might have to do with the fact that her eyes do not appear to be level.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer face is also remarkably rosy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the hard work,\u201d Roberta pointed out. \u201cI would guess that it takes a strong arm to sever a man\u2019s neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. I can see that you are very practical. Do sit down here, Lady Roberta, with your back to the severed head. I shall have it removed at my very first opportunity. I haven\u2019t lived in London for eight years, but I still wake up trembling when I think of my mother-in-law; this is her special sitting room, you understand. Thank goodness, she lives in a dower house in the country now.\u201d</p><p>Roberta seated herself. \u201cI should explain who I am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the duchess interrupted. \u201cYou are my very first encounter as the wife of a politician. So you understand that I am very anxious to get this right. How much money would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not money,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cYou see, I am\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot money! Oh dear, then it\u2019s that altogether more valuable commodity of time, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ll be no use to you. Not only am I congenitally unhelpful in practical matters, but I tend to gather people around me who are as\u2014shall we say\u2014immoral as I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you quite immoral?\u201d Roberta asked, her scruples overcome by strong curiosity. The duchess didn\u2019t look immoral. Of course, Roberta\u2019s assessments were quite likely inaccurate, given that they were founded on years of living with her father\u2019s mistresses, women who prided themselves on a reckless disregard for conventional morality.</p><p>\u201cQuite,\u201d the duchess said with unrelieved cheerfulness. \u201cAbsolutely. Up to my neck in it. Naked ladies on the table is only the start, I assure you. So I\u2019m afraid that my assistance wouldn\u2019t be of the least use to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn truth, I think you can be,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>The duchess looked alarmed. \u201cTruly, I cannot. I become irritable\u2014fierce\u2014when bored, and I am so quickly bored.\u201d</p><p>Roberta was thoroughly enjoying herself now. \u201cHow fierce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDastardly! Once, in the midst of a tedious dinner, I insulted the Comtesse de la Motte by being a trifle too forthright about her origins. She would have gone white in the face, but for her excessive application of rouge.\u201d</p><p>The door swung open rather violently, revealing the duchess\u2019s secretary. Her chest was heaving, her hair was disheveled, and her fists were clenched. In fact, she was the very vision of Judith, lacking only a severed body part or two. Clearly, if her wishes were respected, she would be toting the duke\u2019s head.</p> <p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d the duchess said, under her breath.</p><p>\u201cI return this minute\u2014this evening\u2014this very minute to the shores of France, where my work is appreciated! This husband of yours is a man with no sense of the beauty in life. No sense for the aesthetic value. He has a soul of the mud. He bathes in the dirt, this one! I pity you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Caro,\u201d the duchess said, rising from her chair. \u201cSurely you cannot mean to say that you will leave me. Me? After all the glorious events we planned together? Think of the satyrs! Think of the King sending you a note after the Crystal Forest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husband does not understand my genius,\u201d the enraged Frenchwoman hissed. \u201cI know the type. He will be hedging me about with his concerns and his proprieties. I cannot be hedged about! I am a genius!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeniuses sometimes have to work under terrible conditions,\u201d Roberta suggested, coming forward. \u201cIn fact, it is then that they produce their best, their most enviable work. Think of Michelangelo, lying on his back to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.\u201d</p><p>The maddened eye of the Frenchwoman fixed on Roberta. \u201cMichelangelo was a foolish Italian! I am French! I cannot be stymied by the hidebound opinions of a petty bureaucrat!\u201d</p><p>Behind her, Roberta heard a small snort of laughter from the wife of the petty bureaucrat.</p><p>\u201cBut to turn your back on a true challenge...\u201d Roberta shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not the action of a Frenchwoman, mademoiselle.\u201d Then she decided it would be better to soothe the wild beast in her own language, and continued in the same vein in French, silently thanking her governess for her insistence on the language. \u201cEscusez-nous, c\u2019est bien pour \u00e7a que Leonardo da Vinci a choisi de vivre en France. Nous \u00e9tions, encore, des barbares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is right,\u201d the duchess cooed. \u201cYour artistry has suffered naught but a small setback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cthat you think not in terms of the Queen of the Sea\u2014so redundant, so tedious\u2014but in terms of the great mythological figures. All of whom wore clothes. Now when I see a giant shell, do I think of Neptune? No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d the secretary said, lip curling. \u201cYou think of Venus. I\u2019m tired of Venus and her foolish shell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think of Helen of Troy, the most beautiful woman ever to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd precisely when did Helen appear in a sea shell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a seashell, but an egg,\u201d Roberta explained. \u201cIt can be painted white. The huge egg splits to reveal the woman who began the Trojan War. Of course, she would be wearing classic Greek garb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Caro said, her eyes narrowing. \u201cPerhaps...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant!\u201d the duchess cried. \u201cI adore it, love it, and so will Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my tail!\u201d Caro said. \u201cThe glorious touch of the Queen of Neptune\u2019s mechanical tail, which took two days to design.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever fear, we can use your brilliant peacock tail for something else,\u201d the duchess promised.

Roberta blinked; the pure force of the duchess\u2019s personality was unnerving. \u201cYour pensioners, Lady Roberta, just became my special project!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn truth, I don\u2019t have any pensioners,\u201d Roberta said, returning to her seat. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the duke mistook me for someone more charitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow unusual. Beaumont actually got something wrong. I feel as if a Hallelujah Chorus ought to break out in mid-air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only have myself,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cThat and my luggage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour luggage?\u201d The duchess was looking a bit bewildered now.</p><p>\u201cI am your cousin, thrice removed. Actually more than three. At any rate, my mother looked something like you. We are remotely connected, and I was hoping that you would bring me into society.\u201d Roberta said it with a gulp. She was being remarkably bold, and as Mrs. Grope had assured her, she was likely to be thrown in the street. She clenched her hands together tightly.</p><p>\u201cI have a letter from my father,\u201d she added. \u201cYour father and he were very dear to each other in their youth.\u201d</p><p>The duchess didn\u2019t appear to be curling her lip in horror. \u201cReally? I would have thought my father had no friends at all, from various pleasant little memories I have of him. It\u2019s heartening to imagine that he was once a boy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what am I thinking; you\u2019ve come to stay with me. How splendid!\u201d</p><p>Roberta\u2019s heart thumped. \u201cIt is?\u201d</p> <p>The duchess was smiling. \u201cOf course it is! I never had a sister, and I always wanted one. Don\u2019t worry; I shall know everyone in this benighted city within a week or two, and we\u2019ll make you a splendid marriage. If you don\u2019t mind my asking, are you connected on my mother\u2019s or my father\u2019s side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn your mother\u2019s,\u201d Roberta said, feeling slightly dizzy from the relief of it. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a rather faint connection. My mother was your great-aunt\u2019s second cousin\u2019s child. Her maiden name was Cressida Enright. She was rarely in London, as she married at the age of sixteen. She died when I was quite young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d</p><p>Roberta waited, knowing exactly what was coming.</p><p>\u201cThe Mad Marquess,\u201d the duchess exclaimed. \u201cNot\u2014your father? The poet?\u201d</p><p>Roberta nodded reluctantly.</p> <p>\u201cMy goodness, I suppose that I knew he had a daughter. How old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am twenty-eight. You\u2019re a newborn compared to me. But surely you\u2019re an heiress? Isn\u2019t the Mad Marquess\u2014\u201d She checked herself. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, your father is Marquess of Wharton and?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWharton and Malmesbury,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite all right. No one remembers his title. At any rate, I do have a dowry, but how could I possibly marry, while immured in the country? My father refused to travel even to Bath in the last few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neighbors are no help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have many. My father bought the adjoining estate to the north some years ago. And I\u2019m afraid that he has alienated those who live nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy sending them poetry?\u201d the duchess asked, and stopped. \u201cYou must tell me at your leisure; I shan\u2019t question you like a fishwife in your first five minutes. At any rate, you have done just the right thing. You shall be my ward. All the finest ladies in Paris had wards; they\u2019re so useful in forcing one to not malinger at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine you malingering at home,\u201d Roberta said, rather shyly.</p> <p>The duchess twinkled at her. \u201cPerhaps not alone, but there are certainly times when one finds oneself, shall we say, drawn to the idea of a lazy evening? And yet I consider that to be a woman\u2019s downfall. One must dress every evening, or one quickly becomes a slug.\u201d</p><p>Roberta nodded. Rarely having had an occasion to dress formally in the whole of her life, she found the prospect of a quiet night at home loathsome.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. I suppose you heard about Beaumont\u2019s collapse in Lords last fall? Naturally, I hope that it was nothing more than a case of nerves, but...\u201d Her voice trailed off and Roberta thought that she actually looked rather stricken, which didn\u2019t agree with the biting dislike she\u2019d seen between the duke and duchess.</p><p>\u201cDuty meant I must return.\u201d</p><p>Roberta nodded. Her father\u2019s response to reading of the Duke of Beaumont\u2019s collapse in the very midst of a speech in the House had been to laugh uproariously and prophesy the man was a drunk, but having met the duke, she doubted her father\u2019s diagnosis.</p><p>\u201cI must produce an heir and all the rest of it,\u201d the duchess remarked, quite as if she were saying it might rain tomorrow. \u201cMost unpleasant, but it needs be done, and clearly I\u2019m the one to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019re wondering just how we shall manage the bedding part of it.\u201d</p><p>Roberta stifled a nervous giggle. Talking to the duchess was like talking to no one she had ever encountered before. \u201cI\u2014\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, I share your concern. The imagination quails, truly it does. Beaumont and I rarely exchange words that could be described as civil. But there, Lady Roberta, a woman\u2019s life, etc. etc. Do you play chess by any chance?\u201d</p><p>That question caught Roberta off-balance as well. \u201cNo. I\u2019m afraid I never learned. My father doesn\u2019t play, and my governess had strong views on appropriate activities for women.\u201d</p><p>The duchess waved her hand in the air dismissively. \u201cSpend your time sorting embroidery yarns and generally boring yourself to tears? If you are lucky enough not to spend your days scrubbing a man\u2019s breeches.\u201d</p><p>Roberta couldn\u2019t help it; she started to smile. When Jemma laughed, one simply had to laugh with her.</p><p>\u201cThe only problem I can see with you living here,\u201d the duchess continued, \u201cwould have to do with your standards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy standards?\u201d Roberta asked. The duchess was looking at her expectantly.</p><p>\u201cEthics...morality...that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have them,\u201d Roberta said cautiously. Adding: \u201cI suppose.\u201d In truth, she couldn\u2019t claim a great knowledge of moral strictures, given her father\u2019s propensity for lively companionship.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have only a few.\u201d The duchess smiled at Roberta with an odd, crooked little smile. \u201cIf you are going to live with me, I simply won\u2019t be able to bear it if you are constantly peering at me in a disappointed kind of way. And if you criticize me, I\u2019m afraid that we would quarrel directly. Among my many faults is a quite simple inability to accept that I\u2019m wrong. Do you see how awful I am to live with?\u201d</p><p>Roberta laughed. \u201cI could not be disappointed, not unless you metamorphosed into Mrs. Grope, who has been my constant companion these two years. In truth, Your Grace, I can\u2019t imagine reprimanding you for anything!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019ll think of something. But we\u2019d better go on intimate terms, don\u2019t you think? My name is Jemma, which is short for the worthy name of Jemima. May I address you as Roberta?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Roberta, I shall just enumerate my faults, shall I? And let me be quite clear that if you feel unable to stay with me, I have any number of relatives who will bring you out with all the appropriate rites and ceremonies. In fact, it\u2019s quite possible that you should do that. I\u2019m not at all certain that young, unmarried girls are supposed to be living in houses featuring centerpieces akin to what Caro designs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not the completely naked ones,\u201d Roberta admitted. \u201cBut there is a certain educational value, as your brother noted.\u201d</p><p>Jemma gave a delightful chortle of laughter. \u201cWho knew that it would take so much gold paint to cover one chest?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am just realizing that you managed Caro as beautifully as you deflected my annoyance over my husband\u2019s dictates. I suppose you are used to people of artistic temperament?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife with my father was\u2014has been\u2014\u201d</p><p>Very kindly Jemma cut in. \u201cI can guess,\u201d she said. \u201cLiving in France for years, I was often behind the times with English gossip, but your father\u2019s escapades are always in circulation.\u201d Her smile was so cheerfully nonjudgmental that Roberta found herself smiling back. \u201cSo, do tell me, did you feel faint when you saw my centerpiece?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the slightest,\u201d Roberta assured her. She added, unable to resist, \u201cBut perhaps I shall once you enumerate all your faults.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where to begin,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>Roberta raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see. For one thing, I\u2019m a duchess.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>\u201cA duchess!\u201d Whatever Roberta had been expecting in the way of Jemma\u2019s faults, this wasn\u2019t one of them. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? I have always believed it is a\u2014a consummation devoutly to be wished.\u201d And given that she herself had every intention of being Duchess of Villiers, come hell or high water, she really meant it.</p><p>The door opened and the stout butler, his face returned to a normal hue, entered with a silver tea tray. \u201cOh thank you, Fowle,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThat is so kind of you.\u201d After a moment of fiddling with the tray, he left. Jemma poured tea very carefully into fragile tea cups and asked, \u201cWere you quoting poetry just now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, although I couldn\u2019t tell you who wrote it. My father says the phrase frequently and it stuck in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had much to do with duchesses?\u201d Jemma didn\u2019t seem to mean that question unkindly; she was fussing with the sugar bowl.</p><p>Roberta glanced down at her badly sewn skirt. \u201cNo, I have not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I assure you that we are an abominable sort. The very title gives us license to make the worst of ourselves, and we so frequently do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Roberta accepted a steaming cup of hot tea.</p><p>\u201cI have several duchesses among my acquaintances; in fact, we have formed something of a friendship based on the title itself. You see, to be a duchess means that every person you meet will fawn, if he does not positively grovel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Roberta said, wondering if this was a veiled way of pointing out that she had not groveled appropriately.</p><p>\u201cIt is beyond tedious. It makes one stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cI would hazard the loss of my intelligence. And I am fairly certain,\u201d she said, putting down her cup, \u201cthat a small amount of fawning would be a pleasant antidote to Mrs. Grope\u2019s opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me, Mrs. Grope does seem to enter your conversation with some regularity,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>Roberta hesitated and then prevaricated. \u201cI have had a limited circle of acquaintances in the past few years, and I would love to excise her from my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am dithering on about duchesses. Therein another of my faults: I am incurably shallow. Truthfully, Roberta, my duchess friends are quite like myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that is so terrible?\u201d Roberta was happily conscious that Jemma seemed almost a friend already\u2014which surely implied that she, Roberta, was natural duchess material.</p><p>\u201cShallow. Fickle when it comes to men\u2014and you should take that in the worst possible light. This is not a household in which I can imagine a gently reared vicar\u2019s daughter being comfortable. We are desperate in our affections and even more so in our general dislike for our husbands. Well, those of us who have husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the dukes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the usual sort of things,\u201d Jemma said with a shrug. \u201cBeaumont and I separated years ago, as you must know. My friend Harriet will pay me a visit today; her husband died two years ago, so she\u2019s a widow. I have one friend, Poppy, who is so new to the duchess-business that she is barely wet behind the ears; she\u2019s married to the Duke of Fletcher. Of all of us, I\u2019d say Poppy is our only hope for a happy marital relationship, but she\u2019s going about that all the wrong way. And then finally there\u2019s my friend Isidore. She doesn\u2019t quite count as a duchess, since she hasn\u2019t married her duke yet. They\u2019ve been engaged since birth, and she lives with his mother so if he ever returns from the Orient, or wherever he is, she\u2019ll take the title along with the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I am not a duchess,\u201d Roberta offered, \u201care you quite certain that you wish my company at all? Your acquaintances sound rarefied in the extreme.\u201d</p><p>Jemma opened up her mouth to reply but the door opened and Fowle appeared. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, \u201cHis Grace begs the kindness of a moment of your\u2014\u201d</p><p>Belying the courtesy of the butler\u2019s request, the duke\u2019s voice rose in the near distance, his words muffled but his fury clear.</p><p>Jemma put down her teacup. \u201cI always forget how much I loathe living with a man,\u201d she told Roberta. \u201cPlease do stay here comfortably with your cup of tea, while I reacquaint myself with the pleasures of marital strife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear!\u201d Roberta exclaimed, coming to her feet.</p><p>Jemma paused for a moment, obviously taking in the details of Roberta\u2019s costume for the first time. \u201cTell me that your Mrs. Grope is a seamstress and you have my everlasting sympathy.\u201d</p><p>Roberta felt herself turning pink. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall clothe you,\u201d Jemma said severely. \u201cThough it pains me to say it, I would believe half the eccentricities ascribed to your father merely by examining your gown.\u201d She was at the door before Roberta could answer. But what could she say? She too thought that Mrs. Parthnell had made a mistake by pairing a bodice of melon-colored stuff with a burgundy silk skirt.</p><p>A gently bred young lady would stay in the sitting room and ignore the fracas. Roberta headed directly after the duchess.</p><p>The duke was standing in the marble entry, looking remarkably like the illustrations depicting his impassioned speeches to the House of Lords.</p><p>\u201cHe should go to the country,\u201d the duke roared. \u201cWhere he can be apprenticed to learn a decent trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe child certainly will not go to the country,\u201d Jemma announced. \u201cThat is, unless Damon wishes him to do so.\u201d</p><p>Roberta blinked. Who could the child in question be? Given that Jemma explicitly announced her mandate to produce an heir, it could hardly be hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, he isn\u2019t coming into my house!\u201d the duke snapped.</p><p>\u201cMy brother is coming to stay with me for a time,\u201d Jemma retorted. \u201cAnd his child, my nephew, naturally comes with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake, send him to the care of a farmer!\u201d Beaumont said. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring him up to your own feckless ways, Gryffyn.\u201d</p><p>Lord Gryffyn was lounging against the door to the drawing room with a muscled grace that bespoke a lighthearted demeanor rather than sober industry. \u201cTeddy will never be a farmer,\u201d he said, apparently not turning a hair at Beaumont\u2019s fury. \u201cYou haven\u2019t yet met him, or you\u2019d realize there\u2019s nothing of the farmer in his veins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is in his veins, then?\u201d Beaumont snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t tell us you\u2019re finally going to reveal the name of his mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttila the Hun,\u201d Lord Gryffyn said without blinking an eye.</p><p>\u201cNot known for his maternal instincts,\u201d Beaumont said scathingly.</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, Teddy has Attila\u2019s blood in his veins,\u201d Gryffyn said. \u201cI can\u2019t send him to the country because I have to keep him under my eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I respectfully request that you keep him under your eye in your own house, rather than mine?\u201d</p> <p>Jemma intervened. \u201cI asked Damon to live here, Beaumont, at least for a time, because I have missed him while I lived in Paris. And I have a nephew whom I have never met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it occur to you that the presence of an illegitimate child in my house is not precisely helpful to my career?\u201d</p><p>Roberta could sympathize with the duke. The London papers were bound to find the presence of Lord Gryffyn\u2019s illegitimate child interesting, especially in combination with the naked centerpiece and the return of the duchess.</p><p>\u201cYour career, Beaumont, will have to survive the presence of your family. May I remind you that we are that family?\u201d Jemma said with acid indifference. \u201cTeddy is your nephew.\u201d Her smile, a marvel of kindness, was met by Beaumont\u2019s glowering fury. She waved toward Roberta. \u201cYou mistook my relative, Lady Roberta, for a charity worker, Beaumont. I shall be bringing her into society.\u201d</p><p>Beaumont bowed frigidly in Roberta\u2019s general direction. \u201cAnd precisely how will you do that?\u201d he asked. \u201cI can hardly believe that my notorious wife is going to curb her activities to suit the sensibilities of matchmaking mamas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall consider it if it would stop you from bleating about your career,\u201d Jemma said, turning away.</p> <p>A look of such rage went across Beaumont\u2019s face that Roberta blinked. Then he bowed to his duchess\u2019s back, and once to Roberta, and was gone.</p><p>When Jemma turned around again, her cheeks had gone red and she was breathing quickly. \u201cHow shall I ever live with him?\u201d she said, looking at her brother. \u201cYou see why I want you to move in, Damon? I can\u2019t do it, I really can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her brother straightened. \u201cI will come for a visit if you truly wish me to, Jemma, but I think it would be easier for both of you if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t survive here otherwise, Damon. I can\u2019t live with him.\u201d Her fists were clenched. \u201cYou must stay with me so that I can have a greater acquaintance with my nephew. And\u2014And I need you.\u201d She smiled a little tearily at Roberta. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about the scenes we\u2019re played you today. We\u2019re as good as a farce. Or perhaps I should say a tragedy.\u201d Her voice wobbled a little.</p><p>Lord Gryffyn put his arm around his sister and bent his head close to hers, murmuring something.</p><p>Roberta felt an odd twinge in her chest. She\u2019d never had a brother or sister. Since her mother died, her closest companion had been her father, and whichever of his consorts happened to be living with them.</p><p>She backed into the sitting room and sat down. A moment later Jemma followed with Lord Gryffyn.</p><p>\u201cYou must think us hopelessly ill-mannered. I do apologize. Don\u2019t take all those cakes,\u201d she said, snatching the plate away from her brother. \u201cMy guest hasn\u2019t even had one yet. Roberta, you must have one. Beaumont has an excellent cook, and his ratafia cakes are delicious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even met Lady Roberta properly,\u201d Lord Gryffyn pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThis is Damon Reeve, the Earl of Gryffyn,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIf I tell you that his best friends call him Demon, you\u2019ll know precisely how unworthy he is. Beaumont was absolutely right about his laziness: he never does a worthy action all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA charming introduction,\u201d Lord Gryffyn said. \u201cPlease call me Damon. After all, we\u2019re family members, as I understand.\u201d He took another cake.</p><p>The duchess took the plate away and put it on the floor between herself and Roberta. \u201cEat as many as you like,\u201d she said to Roberta. \u201cI know him of old, and if I don\u2019t act quickly, there\u2019ll be none left for us.\u201d</p><p>Gryffyn threw her an affectionate grin. \u201cBeaumont had a point about his career, Jemma. Both of our reputations in the same small space may well damage it, not to mention Lady Roberta\u2019s marital aspirations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you all these years,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI\u2019m not giving you up so soon, and I want to meet Teddy properly.\u201d She turned to Roberta. \u201cDamon\u2019s son Teddy is just five years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe turned six last week, you unnatural aunt,\u201d Gryffyn said. \u201cI missed you too, Jemma. But I hardly want to cause the fraying of your marriage.\u201d</p><p>Jemma snorted inelegantly.</p><p>\u201cBeaumont doesn\u2019t mean to be such an ass,\u201d Gryffyn added.</p><p>\u201cHe just acts that way?\u201d his sister said. \u201cBut enough airing our linen, dirty and otherwise, in front of Roberta. You must bring Teddy and his nanny this very afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, he has no nanny at the moment. Teddy has an annoying habit of escaping and the latest nanny stomped away in a temper yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscaping? Where does he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere but the nursery. Generally he goes to the stables during the day. And he wanders the house at night until he finds my chamber, and then he climbs in my bed. Last night he couldn\u2019t find it, so he slept in the vestibule until I came home. Marble floor. Cold, I should think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father had a dog like that,\u201d Roberta said. And then clapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to compare your son to a dog, my lord!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, you really must call me Damon,\u201d he said, looking absolutely unmoved by the slur to his offspring. \u201cChildren are slightly doggish, don\u2019t you think? They need so much training, and they have a dislikable habit of urinating in public places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you bar the nursery door,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cparticularly now that you remind me of children\u2019s indiscriminate attitude toward hygiene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that,\u201d Damon said. \u201cWhat if there was a fire? And Teddy, by the way, is past the age of indiscriminate peeing. He\u2019s very good at seeking out a tree, just like the well-trained puppy he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could carpet the vestibule,\u201d Roberta suggested. \u201cIf you mean to allow him to continue in this habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkably uncharitable on both your parts,\u201d Damon complained. Then he looked back and forth. \u201cHow odd! I suddenly see quite a resemblance between the two of you. Don\u2019t tell me! My illegitimate child is only matched by our father\u2019s own indiscretions!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cActually not,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI\u2019m legitimate, but from a far branch of the family tree. I only wish that I resembled Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have her blue eyes,\u201d he said, grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cRoberta is going to be my project,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI\u2019m going to dress her up to look absolutely gorgeous, which of course she is, and then marry her off to whomever she wishes. It\u2019ll be great fun.\u201d</p><p>Roberta felt a queer compression around her chestbone. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt will be frightfully expensive. I\u2019m not sure how much I can persuade my father to contribute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJemma\u2019s husband can manage a dozen debuts and not notice,\u201d Damon said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Beaumont bothers with his speechifying; he could just buy the votes he needs to get a bill passed, in the time-honored fashion. That\u2019s what father always did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the third earl\u2014our father\u2014was a tad disreputable,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou interrupted me, Damon. I was trying to warn Roberta that she might not want my chaperonage.\u201d</p><p>Damon looked her over so carefully that Roberta felt herself getting pink. \u201cIt\u2019s true that your reputation was marred by merely walking into this den of inequity, or it will be once the English ladies get the measure of my sister. Jemma is unlikely to be a prudent chaperone. The Reeves have been disreputable back to the days of King Alfred, and though I regret to say it, the tendency bred true in both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma has neglected to tell you that I am the only child of the Mad Marquess, to use the term the popular press prefers,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cSo the ton will have more hurdles than Jemma\u2019s reputation to consider when it comes to my marriage.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cYou grow more fascinating by the moment. Do tell me a bit of poetry.\u201d</p> <p>She scowled at him, and then relented. \u201cMy father\u2019s letter to you, Jemma, takes the form of a poem in fourteen stanzas.\u201d She opened her little knotting-bag and handed over her father\u2019s letter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s entitled \u2018Epistle to a Duchess,\u2019\u201d Jemma said. Roberta watched her smile fade into a look of puzzlement. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m intelligent enough for poetry,\u201d she said, finally.</p><p>Which was a kind assessment. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of your intelligence,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that Papa\u2019s poetry is obscure in the extreme.\u201d</p><p>Damon took the poem. \u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad. It ever was allow\u2019d, dear Madam, Even from the days of father Adam. Well, I don\u2019t see much of difficulty here, Roberta. Such stuff is naught but mere tautology,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat\u2019s tautology again? I can\u2019t remember, if I ever knew. And so take that for my apology. He\u2019s apologizing, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor imposing his daughter upon your presence,\u201d Roberta said firmly.</p> <p>Damon was still reading ahead. \u201cHere he\u2019s talking about the solid meal of sense and worth, set off by the dessert of mirth. Very nice rhyme!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes his poetry is quite good,\u201d Roberta said with a flash of loyalty. \u201cHe\u2019s writing an excellent poem on David and Bathsheba, for example. One can really understand what he\u2019s describing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this poem ends with your most obedient,\u201d Damon said. \u201cI think he\u2019s asking you to bring out his daughter with all the pomp and circumstance Beaumont can afford, Roberta. My expert judgment.\u201d</p><p>Jemma took back the poem and puzzled at it for a moment. \u201cBut what\u2019s the part about a rude ungrateful bear, enough to make a parson swear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find with Papa\u2019s poems that it\u2019s best not to devote oneself too strictly to meaning,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>Damon let out a bark of laughter.</p><p>\u201cThere is just one more thing that I should tell you,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>Brother and sister turned to look at her. \u201cWait, don\u2019t tell us,\u201d Damon said, with his irresistible grin. \u201cThe family character bred true in you as well, remote relative though you are. Let\u2019s guess: You have a child\u2014you, with such a young, innocent\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>But before she could continue, he said, \u201cYour turn, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked thoughtful. \u201cAt some time last year, you were at an inn. You gazed out of the window and were instantly struck by an ungovernable passion for my brother.\u201d</p><p>Roberta\u2019s mouth fell open but Damon didn\u2019t notice. \u201cVery nice! Can you work Teddy into the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything, Roberta wished to be a mother, but unfortunate circumstances have decreed that she will have no children of her own, therefore Teddy will become her most cherished possession.\u201d</p><p>Damon was laughing. \u201cWhat about me? I want to be her most cherished possession.\u201d</p><p>Jemma turned to Roberta. \u201cYou must forgive us; it\u2019s an old game that we\u2014\u201d She stopped. \u201cYou did see Damon last summer! And you fell in love with him? How very peculiar. Are you sure you wish to marry my brother? I can assure you that he\u2019s terribly annoying.\u201d</p><p>Roberta started giggling. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t wish to marry your brother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be quite so emphatic,\u201d Damon observed. \u201cI would quite like to marry you myself, although I see that I shall have to assuage my grieved heart elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I saw something on your face,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to a ball given by Lady Cholmondelay,\u201d Roberta said hurriedly, getting over the rough ground as quickly as she could. \u201cAnd I did meet someone. I should like to marry him. In fact, I have made up my mind to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow useful,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cLove at first sight. I\u2019m sure it must be most delicious. I would quite welcome it myself. I\u2019ve fallen in love many times but never without thoroughly discussing the impulse with my closest friends.\u201d</p><p>Her brother snorted. \u201cNot to mention your less-than-close friends and the other half of Paris. Although I thought it was love at first sight between Delacroix and yourself. All Paris thought it was.\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked insulted. \u201cAbsolutely not! I spoke to each of my intimate friends before I allowed myself to feel a patch of affection for the man. That is my invariable practice. A man about whom one knows nothing is invariably boring or diseased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you have it, Lady Roberta. You might want to rethink your love at first sight,\u201d Damon said.</p><p>\u201cI do know quite a lot about him,\u201d Roberta said shyly.</p><p>\u201cIf there is one thing in the world that I love it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThe bigger the challenge, the better!\u201d</p><p>Roberta took a deep breath. And told them.</p><p>She was answered by silence.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>That afternoon</p><p>H arriet, Duchess of Berrow, hadn\u2019t been in London for a year, and she hadn\u2019t been to Beaumont House in at least eight. It was just the same, of course: a huge, jumbled assortment of mullioned windows and towers that had no place in London. Terraces sprawled on two sides, in blatant defiance of the properly contained attitude of a townhouse. It looked as if it had been picked up in Northamptonshire, transported by a giant\u2019s hand to London, and plopped down on the street. The other houses around it\u2014elegantly built in the Portland stone everyone preferred\u2014looked positively affronted at having to reside beside such a monstrosity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The last time she\u2019d been here Benjamin had been alive. He\u2019d run up the stairs, always ahead of her, and banged the knocker himself.</p><p>Then, Benjamin had leapt ahead of her in every way, and now footmen were the only men who accompanied her to parties.</p><p>The door opened and she gave herself a mental shake. The last thing she wanted to do was lower Jemma\u2019s spirits. Benjamin was gone, had been gone these many months and after she did just one thing in his memory\u2014just the one\u2014she would forget him. Put him away in her memories, or whatever it is you do with a dead husband.</p><p>Truly, a dead husband was an inconvenient presence, she realized, not for the first time.</p> <p>The butler led her to a small dining room and then stood to the side. \u201cThe Duchess of\u2014\u201d he intoned. Suddenly he lunged forward, words forgotten.</p><p>Jemma was standing on a chair, with her back to them. She was in the process of unhooking a very large painting from the wall. Even as they watched she staggered back, her heel on the very edge of the seat, the huge frame waving in the air.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace!\u201d the butler shouted. He caught the huge gold frame just as it began toppling toward the ground.</p><p>Harriet rushed forward as well, just in time to stand directly under Jemma as she fell off the chair. They both hit the ground with a whoosh as their hoops swelled up around them. Simultaneously the butler lost his grip on the painting and it crashed into a sideboard.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Jemma said, laughing. \u201cIs that Harriet?\u201d</p> <p>Harriet scrambled to her feet. Jemma\u2019s butler was shouting, presumably for a footman.</p><p>\u201cIt is indeed I,\u201d she said, smiling down at Jemma. Her friend had changed; her beauty had a modish edge that was a long way from Harriet\u2019s childhood memories. But the sleek blonde hair, the deep lip and most of all, her litup, intelligent eyes, those were the same.</p><p>With one practiced slap, Jemma collapsed her right pannier and then rolled to that side to get up. Harriet held out a hand. With another whoosh, Jemma\u2019s panniers exploded as she stood up and there she was: as sophisticated and elegant a French lady as Harriet could imagine.</p><p>She swallowed her up in one of the lightning quick hugs Harriet remembered so well. \u201cYou are as beautiful as ever, but so thin, Harriet. And the black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you do remember...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s been almost two years since Benjamin died, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Jemma pulled back. \u201cDid you get my note after his funeral?\u201d</p> <p>Harriet nodded. \u201cAnd I had your lovely note from Florence too, with the drawings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it had been a year,\u201d Jemma twinkled at her. \u201cI personally think that David has a lovely physique although perhaps slightly, shall we say, under-endowed?\u201d</p><p>Harriet laughed a bit hollowly. \u201cOnly you would notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. It\u2019s enough to make one eye Italian males in a most suspicious manner, I assure you. After all, it might well be a national trait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing with that portrait?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cGhastly thing. I stared at it all the way through luncheon and then promised myself that I would take it off the wall directly.\u201d</p><p>Harriet glanced at it, but couldn\u2019t see that it was particularly depressing; it depicted a man asleep on a bed while a woman stood next to him with a flask of wine.</p><p>\u201cLook more closely,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cDo you see her knife?\u201d</p> <p>Sure enough, hidden in the folds of her skirt was the wicked, curved tip of a knife. And on close observation, the woman\u2019s face was rather disturbing.</p><p>\u201cThe house is bestrewed by versions of Judith and Holofernes. I would ask Beaumont about his mother\u2019s penchant for the subject, but I\u2019m terrified of his likely answer. In this one, she\u2019s about to saw his head off. If you\u2019d like to see the event itself, that is hanging in the grand salon in the west wing. The aftermath\u2014i.e., his head apart from his body\u2014appears in various versions all over the house.\u201d</p><p>Harriet blinked. \u201cHow\u2014how\u2014\u201d and closed her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI gather you don\u2019t know the Dowager Duchess of Beaumont,\u201d Jemma continued blithely. \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs, shall we? We can have some tea in my rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, this is quite lovely,\u201d Harriet said a moment later. The walls were white with pale green trim, and painted all over with little sprays of blossoms. \u201cDid Beaumont have the room made over for your return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he didn\u2019t,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI sent a man from Paris two months ago, as soon as I decided to return to London. My mother-in-law had this room very grand in gold-and-white. Naturally I had to have all new furnishings. I am so fond of French panniers, you know. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to fit into the chairs designed thirty years ago.\u201d</p><p>Harriet paused beside a small marble chess table. It was set out with a game in progress. \u201cYou haven\u2019t given up your chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember enough of the game to see where I am? I\u2019m playing white, and my queen is in a veritable nest of pawns. I\u2019m almost certainly beaten.\u201d Jemma dropped into a comfortably wide chair, her panniers effortlessly compressing under her silk skirt.</p><p>Harriet sighed. It had always been so, even when they were young girls growing up on adjoining estates. She and Jemma would go for picnics, and she would come back having been bitten by stinging ants, with her hair down her back. Jemma would traipse back to the house wearing a posy of daisies and every hair in place. Sure enough, when she lowered herself cautiously into the chair opposite Jemma, her right-side hoop sprang into the air like a huge blister. She forced it into place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d Jemma said, stretching out her legs. \u201cI love Paris, as you must know. But I missed you.\u201d</p><p>Harriet smiled, a rueful smile. She\u2019d lived a country mouse\u2019s life for the past few years. \u201cYou have been in Paris,\u201d she said. \u201cYou needn\u2019t tell me flummery like that. Those are the most gorgeous little slippers, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis is full of Frenchwomen. They are nice slippers, aren\u2019t they? I like the embroidery. I have them in three different shades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that Paris is full of Frenchwomen surely came as no surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my Harriet! I missed your peppery little comments. You always deflated my absurdities.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cAre you all right? You seem tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be quite over Benjamin\u2019s death,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty-two months. But somehow thinking of him makes me tired, and I can\u2019t stop thinking, no matter how I try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking of Beaumont makes me tired, and he\u2019s not even dead. At any rate, Frenchwomen make difficult friends. They\u2019re given to thinking that Englishwomen are, by nature, inelegant and rather foolish. But even if one overcomes the prejudices of one\u2019s nationality, I have never felt as easy with a Frenchwoman as I do with you, Harriet.\u201d And as if to demonstrate her point, she stood up, reached under her skirts and untied her panniers. With a little clatter they fell to the ground and Jemma curled bonelessly back into the chair. \u201cGo on,\u201d she said, \u201cyou do it too! You are spending the day with me, aren\u2019t you? I must introduce you to Roberta; she\u2019s a young relative come to live with me and make her debut.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harriet hesitated. \u201cYou have a ball tomorrow. Surely you have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not! I have a marvelous secretary who handles all the wretched details of putting on an event. She thrives on it. My role is to stay to my rooms and keep out of the way.\u201d</p><p>Harriet got up and dumped her hoops. \u201cHow I loathe these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore them,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than arranging huge swathes of silk just so; one always makes a grand entrance if one\u2019s hoops are large enough. This season the fashion in Paris is for smaller panniers, which in itself was a good reason to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Since Harriet loathed the idea of a grand entrance under any circumstances, and particularly with huge wire baskets attached to her sides, she changed the subject. \u201cSo who is Roberta, and what is her surname?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Roberta St. Giles. She\u2019s great fun; I am persuaded the two of you will like each other enormously. The only problem is that she\u2019s quite desperately in love and the man is rather unlikely.\u201d She reached out toward the bellcord. \u201cI\u2019ll ask if she could join us, shall I? She\u2019s been in fittings for a ballgown but perhaps she is finished.\u201d</p><p>But Harriet quickly waved her hand. \u201cI want to ask you something first.\u201d</p><p>Jemma dropped the cord. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014It\u2019s about Benjamin.\u201d Whenever she brought up her dead husband, people\u2019s faces took on one of two expressions. If they knew only that she was a widow, their faces took on a practiced look of sympathy, often quite genuine. They would offer stories of aunts who were widowed and found true love a mere week afterward, as if she, Harriet, were lusting to marry over the very coffin of her husband.</p> <p>But if they knew that Benjamin committed suicide, their faces had an entirely different look: more guarded, more truly sympathetic, slightly horrified, as if suicide were a contagious disease. No one offered stories of relatives who put themselves to death.</p><p>Jemma looked purely sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cHe killed himself,\u201d Harriet said bluntly. \u201cHe shot himself in the head after losing a game at which he gambled a great deal of money.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked at her for a moment. Then she jumped out of her chair and plumped down next to Harriet. Without panniers, the chair was more than wide enough for both of them. \u201cThat is absolutely terrible,\u201d she said, wrapping an arm around her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Harriet. No one told me.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes one? I supposed I would get over my husband doing such a thing, simply because we aren\u2019t very close to each other. But you and Benjamin\u2014how could he do such a thing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Despite herself her voice cracked a bit, and Jemma\u2019s arm tightened. \u201cHe was so miserable. He was never good at being miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think of him as always laughing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was never very good at being formal, nor sad either. Nor ashamed of himself. He was ashamed of himself, and that\u2019s why he did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a game of cards! And why was he playing such high stakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t cards,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cIt was chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess!\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, a tear rolled down her cheek. Jemma produced a handkerchief from somewhere and blotted her cheek. Harriet almost smiled. It was the softest, most elegant little scrap of cloth she\u2019d seen in years, perhaps ever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mortifying to be crying for him,\u201d she said, sniffing a bit.</p> <p>\u201cWhy? I would think you should wear your grief like a badge of honor. After all, you care enough to grieve. I can hardly imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mortifying because he\u2014he was so eager to leave me that he took his own life.\u201d It came out angry.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s foolish, darling, and you know it. Your husband no more wished to leave you than he truly thought to give up life. I know Benjamin, remember? I was there when you fell in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I fell in love,\u201d Harriet said, more angry tears swelling in her eyes. \u201cIf he was in love with me, he showed an odd way of displaying his passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did fall in love with you. But Benjamin was a remarkably impetuous person. I\u2019m sure he regretted shooting himself the moment he did it, but it was too late. He just didn\u2019t think clearly before acting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have thought about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the chess game public?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Chess is all the rage now. Everyone\u2019s playing it, in the caf\u00e9s, in private houses. White\u2019s. Sometimes I think it\u2019s all anyone talks about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow surprising. I had no idea. I thought it was only like that in France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin had a tremendous passion for chess. He couldn\u2019t just play, you know? He had to be among the very best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Jemma said sadly.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that? Of course, you used to play him occasionally, didn\u2019t you? Did he ever win?\u201d</p><p>Jemma shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe could beat most everyone,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cTruly. But he couldn\u2019t bear the fact that he couldn\u2019t beat the very top players. It was almost like a disease, the way he wanted to beat Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Villiers he played at the last?\u201d Jemma asked. \u201cVilliers?\u201d</p><p>Harriet dashed away more tears. \u201cWhy are you so surprised? Villiers is the best chess player in England. Or so they say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just very odd,\u201d Jemma said slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking of Villiers all morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to play him in chess?\u201d Harriet said, feeling hopefulness tighten in her chest like a vise.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that. It\u2019s my guest, Roberta. Lady Roberta St. Giles. She\u2019s in love with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn love with Villiers?\u201d Harriet smiled weakly. \u201cI believe I pity her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he a friend of Benjamin\u2019s, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers played Benjamin all the time, but he never allowed any stakes. Which was just a condescending way of telling Benjamin that he was unlikely to win. Then finally Benjamin challenged him and Villiers agreed to play. Benjamin played well in the beginning. But now, I think that Villiers may have been just playing along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Jemma said, holding her hands tightly.</p><p>\u201cAnd Benjamin started to raise the stakes on the game. I gather that Villiers refused and Benjamin got so angry\u2014it was when he was winning, or he thought he was winning\u2014that he forced Villiers to give in. That\u2019s what everyone told me afterwards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Benjamin realized at first. But he must have gone home and thought over the game, step by step. I was in the country, you see. I wasn\u2019t there; perhaps if I\u2019d been in London I could have stopped him somehow. At any rate, he must have realized that Villiers had just been babying him. That he never had a chance of winning that game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin loved chess that much,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cHe should have loved me that much!\u201d</p><p>Jemma sighed. \u201cChess is a passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem was that Benjamin was too good to play most people, and not quite good enough for the very best. He used to try to get your husband to play with him; he even said that he would trade a game for his vote in Lords.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHa,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cHe misstepped there. Beaumont has one god: his honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont just said that he never played anymore. He doesn\u2019t, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so far as I know. I only played him a few times when we were first married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you beat him? Your husband, I mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. But he was awfully good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anyone you haven\u2019t beaten, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery chess player loses occasionally. I only played one game with the French king and he won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing Louis? Then you allowed him to win,\u201d Harriet said with a little crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cPrudence is part of strategy,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut you know I haven\u2019t played very many people, Harriet, so it hardly signifies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never played Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I only met him once and that briefly. He was traveling on the continent during the first year of my marriage, and I\u2019ve been in Paris since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say he\u2019s the best player in England.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI hate him for what he did to Benjamin.\u201d</p><p>Jemma blinked. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shamed him. And I think he did it deliberately. I\u2019ve thought and thought about it. I think he agreed to play the game in White\u2019s, just to make Benjamin stop nagging at him. And then\u2014and then Benjamin lost, of course, but Villiers had played it so that Benjamin thought he would win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Harriet wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cHe\u2019s an awful man. A positive wolf. He had affaires with half the ton, if you believe the stories, and he treats all his lovers despicably. They say he has at least four illegitimate children.\u201d</p><p>There was a noise at the door and Jemma came back with a tea tray.</p><p>Harriet drank half of her tea in one gulp. \u201cI want you to do me a favor, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>Jemma reached to the sugar bowl. \u201cAnything, dearest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to shame Villiers.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cWhat? Shame him\u2014how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d Harriet said fiercely. \u201cYou could take him as a lover, and spurn him. Or take him as a lover and make fun of him, or something like that. I know you can do it.\u201d</p><p>Jemma was giggling. \u201cI love your faith in my abilities,\u201d she said. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could play chess with him.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about, isn\u2019t it? You came from the country not to see me, but to ask me to play chess with Villiers?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. \u201cI came to see you, Jemma. We\u2019re not as close as we were when we were children. You\u2019ve changed; you\u2019ve grown sophisticated, and even more beautiful, and I\u2019m just a country mouse.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s eyes had assessed her brown curls and her clumsily handled panniers; she must know it was the truth.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t live in the city with Benjamin,\u201d Harriet said, though her throat was so tight she could hardly speak it. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t make this life work, putting my hair up, and powdering it, and taking hours to get dressed. Having a maid, and a dresser, and all the rest of it bores me. I just couldn\u2019t stand the boredom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that, of course,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt can be quite tedious.\u201d She smiled, but she was cooler now, more distant.</p><p>\u201cSo I left Benjamin here and I went to the country,\u201d Harriet stumbled on.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have stopped him from loving chess,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>Harriet felt a wave of desperation. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand!\u201d She almost shouted it.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be around him, because\u2014because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany couples live apart,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t your fault that Benjamin committed suicide, simply because you were living in the country. You could not have stopped him from losing a game to Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d Harriet said. She lifted her chin. \u201cI had an affaire with Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Jemma sat bolt upright. \u201cYou had an affaire?\u201d</p><p>It was such a relief to tell someone that the words tumbled out. \u201cIt was two years ago, at a ball given by the Duchess of Claverstill, about a month before Benjamin died. Benjamin was playing chess all night. Every ball has a chess room now. It\u2019s so tiresome. Some nights there aren\u2019t any partners for dancing. At any rate, Villiers came out of the chess room and, somehow, he found me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is he like? I don\u2019t know much about him, other than that he was a boyhood friend of Beaumont\u2019s and they had some sort of falling out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate him,\u201d Harriet said, her voice shaking.</p><p>\u201cBecause you spent the night with him?\u201d To Harriet\u2019s relief, Jemma had lost her air of froideur. She poured more tea for both of them.</p><p>\u201cBecause\u2014he didn\u2019t really\u2014it was just like the game with Benjamin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She might as well tell the whole. \u201cThe truth of it is that we didn\u2019t really have an affaire. I was so cross at Benjamin that I just\u2014well, I lost my head. Villiers was taking me home and\u2014and\u2014but he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be a bit more clear,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBased on my rather varied experience of men, I\u2019d say that he made an advance to you in the carriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harriet said, drinking again. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent decision,\u201d Jemma said promptly. \u201cFrenchwomen understand that a woman must pick and choose amongst her admirerers rather than leaving it to the man\u2019s discretion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no men for me,\u201d Harriet said miserably. \u201cBenjamin was the only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened with Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me for a bit, but then\u2014well\u2014this is so embarrassing. He did this thing.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s eyes were bright with interest. \u201cWhat thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith\u2014with his hands. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I pour you some more tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then. So I\u2014I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do? I gather you didn\u2019t just swoon and say, Touch me again!\u201d Jemma was giggling so hard that her tea was in danger of spilling.</p><p>\u201cWell, I said, actually I shrieked, What are you doing? And he just did it again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t any better the second time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done?\u201d Harriet asked desperately.</p><p>\u201cIt would definitely depend on the thing in question. I enjoy many things that men do with their hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so much more sophisticated than I am. I\u2019m not like that. I slapped him. Which is just what my mother, not that my mother would ever, well, it\u2019s what she would have approved of, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Jemma said, gurgling with laughter. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>Harriet took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you exactly what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that he had always pitied Benjamin for his miserable chess-playing, but from now on he would try to be nicer to him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNasty!\u201d Jemma said looking impressed.</p><p>\u201cAnd then he said that there was nothing worse than a lady whore. And that I had tried to get him to screw one of his best friends, and he must be drunk, because he\u2019d forgotten how damn boring women like me were. And finally he said that if I told Benjamin he would kill me.\u201d</p><p>The laughter had died on Jemma\u2019s face. \u201cThat bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he put me out on the street. In the middle of Whitefriars Lane and I didn\u2019t have even a ha\u2019penny. I had to walk all the way home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDouble bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never told Benjamin. I left for the country the next day because I was such a coward that I couldn\u2019t face him. I felt so guilty and so\u2014so dirty! But then someone wrote me and said they had announced in Parsloe\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe London Chess Club meets at Parsloe\u2019s. They only take one hundred members, and it\u2019s frightfully exclusive. At any rate, a week or so afterwards they announced that Villiers would be playing Benjamin, in public and for stakes, at White\u2019s. So I knew why Villiers did it. Because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why I flirted with him,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cYou\u2019d think I would have had enough of men who prefer to caress pieces of ivory rather than me. It was so paltry of me. And how\u2014how terribly wrong it all went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife can be like that,\u201d Jemma said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Harriet said, hearing the rank desperation in her own voice, \u201cI just want Villiers humiliated somehow. It\u2019s all I can think of. I have to make it right for Benjamin. I have to clear my slate. I have to, Jemma!\u201d</p><p>Jemma reached out and took her hand. \u201cBenjamin is gone, Harriet. There\u2019s no slate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Jemma sat still for a moment. Then: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do this because of the chess match. I can understand Benjamin\u2019s mortification at losing that match. I could never take my life, but I can understand the horror of losing. Benjamin\u2019s reaction wouldn\u2019t be Villiers\u2019s fault. Truly, Harriet. It\u2019s the chess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate chess.\u201d She said it flatly, but with utter conviction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it because he was an utter bastard to leave you in the road, and to say those things, Harriet. No one says something like that to a friend of mine and gets away with it scot-free. The only problem is that I shall have to be rather subtle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I would prefer that he be shamed in front of all London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cI told you that Roberta is desperately in love with Villiers. She\u2019s determined to marry him, and I promised I would help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth are you going to humiliate him at the same time as you push him into marriage?\u201d Harriet began to wring her hands.</p><p>But Jemma was grinning again. \u201cThe two things are by no means mutually exclusive, you know. And I love a challenge. The first thing I\u2019ll do is invite him to my ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe and Beaumont never speak; he won\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cLeave that to me. Now, are you coming?\u201d</p> <p>Harriet gulped. \u201cWould you mind very much if I didn\u2019t, Jemma? I can\u2019t tell you how horrible it has been since Benjamin died. Everyone looks at me with sympathy except for people who believe I drove him to it. Lady Lacock always tells me that Benjamin was a cheerful baby, until I feel as if I could scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to solve that too,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cMy life? Some other night,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But you must come for a council of war tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Jemma...may I decline? I promised I would return to the country as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did you promise? You should be here for the season, Harriet, thinking about marrying again. You can\u2019t stay a dour widow forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Harriet said, and then, desperate to change the subject, \u201cI still don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be able to get Villiers to enter this house.\u201d</p><p>Jemma just smiled.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>R oberta would be the first to admit that life with her father had not been designed to turn a young lady into a leader in fashion. It wasn\u2019t that her father had no money; she rather suspected that he had quite a lot. But his priorities were directed in precisely the opposite direction than everything about which Roberta dreamed: London, balls, love, marriage...</p><p>\u201cBut Papa,\u201d she would argue with him at supper, \u201cyou don\u2019t wish me to live with you my whole life, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love that!\u201d he would say, beaming at her. \u201cWho else will catalog my poetry, if not you, my dear? And your criticism, though occasionally harsh, has done much to improve my art. Much! Much! The future will preserve a warm place for you as the muse of the Marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d she would say (for variations on this theme had recurred for years), \u201cI don\u2019t want to appear in history books as your muse, and I dislike cataloging poetry.\u201d Sometimes she would add that she didn\u2019t like critiquing poetry, either, but that depended on how recently she had torn apart one of his new poems.</p><p>At this, the marquess\u2019s face would fall into tragic lines, and he would begin to mutter about the serpent\u2019s tooth that was his only child. And if she begged a new gown, he never said no, but he would only pay for Mrs. Parthnell in the village. \u201cIf we don\u2019t employ her, child, who will?\u201d One of Mrs. Parthnell\u2019s peculiarities was that she refused to line a sleeve in anything but white cotton duck, and due to sewing problems she routinely encountered, the white generally showed.</p><p>Even so, the faces of Jemma\u2019s French maids were almost comical in their dismay when they beheld Roberta. Her gown had once been styled \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, but Mrs. Parthnell had cut out the floating back pleats and used tapes to draw up the sides around into a clumsy polonaise instead. When Roberta objected to the way the waist bunched as it encountered the new bustle, Mrs. Parthnell cut out the bodice and replaced it with one of melon-colored cotton.</p><p>Apparently, Roberta\u2019s sense that melon-colored cotton and burgundy silk were not a perfect match was correct, if the rather piercing screams of the French seamstresses could be taken as evidence.</p><p>Two seconds later she was stripped to her chemise and Mrs. Parthnell\u2019s gown was thrown in the corner. \u201cFor the beggars,\u201d Jemma\u2019s femme de chambre, Brigitte, had explained. \u201cNone of us could wear such a thing.\u201d</p><p>There was a cheerful little chorus of French agreements from Jemma\u2019s other two maids. Formal gown after gown was brought out, discussed at length, and ceremoniously carried back to Jemma\u2019s dressing room, which Roberta could only imagine as crammed with satins and silks.</p><p>Brigitte had explicit directions from the duchess herself. \u201cShe must look like a young lady of the utmost innocence,\u201d she dictated. After a half hour or so of gowns trundling from the dressing room to Roberta\u2019s chamber, it became clear that very few of Jemma\u2019s gowns were designed to achieve an innocent air.</p><p>The few that were tried on Roberta quickly lost their claims to innocence, though Roberta thought they were exquisite. Even catching a glimpse of herself wearing one of Jemma\u2019s dazzling French gowns made her heart sing. She didn\u2019t look like a drab country mouse anymore: she looked beautiful. Visions of the Duke of Villiers on his knees spun dizzyingly through her mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are too generous in the front,\u201d Brigitte stated, dispelling that dream.</p><p>Roberta peered down at her chest. She had nothing compared to the naked centerpiece, after all.</p><p>\u201cIs excellent!\u201d Brigitte said hurriedly. \u201cThe men, they are most fond of bosoms. Many bosoms!\u201d</p><p>Since Brigitte likely didn\u2019t mean that men preferred women with more than two breasts, Roberta took this as a compliment. Unfortunately, her \u201cmany bosoms\u201d made many of Jemma\u2019s gowns unacceptable. She overflowed the bodices in a fashion that Brigitte kept declaring sensuelle, rather than innocente.</p> <p>Suddenly Brigitte clapped her hands. \u201cThe white silk moir\u00e9!\u201d she announced.</p><p>There was a little flurry of conversation. One maid ventured the fact that Jemma had labeled the gown ennuyeuse. \u201cBoring,\u201d Brigitte announced, \u201cis just what is needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but\u2014\u201d Roberta said unhappily. This was ignored, as had been every other comment she ventured to make.</p><p>It certainly was a lovely dress, embroidered with tiny sprays of flowers that looked as if they\u2019d been scattered by the wind. It showed rather less of her breasts than the others, because the neckline was a V, and trimmed with a small ruffle of white lace. The sleeves were tight and ended in a gorgeous frill. It was exquisite, but Roberta thought that Jemma was right. It was boring.</p><p>She had no say in the matter; all the other dresses, luscious in deep crimson and striped green, were whisked away, and Brigitte got down to the serious business of altering the white gown to fit.</p> <p>\u201cYou will look like a fairy princess at the ball,\u201d Brigitte said with great satisfaction. \u201cAll the princes will bow at your feet.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to Roberta that Villiers was not the sort to bow at the feet of an innocent fairy princess, but how could she complain? He wouldn\u2019t genuflect at the feet of the fleshy crocodile dressed in gold paint either; she was certain of that. She would have to study him closely in order to decide precisely how to pitch her courtship.</p><p>By the time Roberta made it out of her bedchamber it was late in the afternoon. Her father\u2019s house was large, but Beaumont House was far larger. Within the turn of a corridor, she was lost.</p><p>Part of the problem was that she wasn\u2019t concentrating on finding her way. Perhaps Jemma was right. An innocent dress was like a suit of armor, insuring that no one would remember that the Mad Marquess lived with his courtesan, which meant that she, Roberta, had lived in close proximity with that same woman. On the whole, Roberta felt that her friendships with her father\u2019s companions had been interesting. But obviously, one might not wish to trumpet those acquaintances around a ballroom.</p><p>She had climbed another flight of stairs, and was wandering down a sun-lit corridor lined with closed doors, which she thought might be taking her back to the central part of the house, when she heard a patter of feet.</p><p>He burst around the corner going as fast as only a small boy can go.</p> <p>Roberta guessed immediately that this was Damon\u2019s son, and decided there was no call to halt him. So she moved aside so that he could use the rest of the corridor as a race course, if he wished. But he skidded to a stop next to her.</p><p>Pop went his thumb into his mouth.</p><p>Roberta shuddered inwardly. She had had very little contact with children in her life, but she\u2019d seen thumb-sucking in church. The very fact that someone would want to suck on a saliva-covered digit was disgusting.</p><p>He was staring up at her, so she smiled. He wasn\u2019t a terrible-looking child, just tousled. It seemed that no one had brushed his hair. Of course, there was no nanny.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to continue running,\u201d she advised him.</p><p>He just stared. And sucked.</p><p>So she continued to walk. He walked right along beside her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked, trying to be friendly.</p> <p>\u201cTeddy,\u201d he said. In order to answer he took his thumb out with a \u201cpop.\u201d</p><p>Roberta shuddered again. Enough polite conversation.</p><p>But a moment later he dropped the thumb of his own volition and said, \u201cWhatcha doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalking,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s running, I am,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am running,\u201d she corrected him. Perhaps that was a bit harsh, but after life with her father she had very little sympathy for inverted syntax, poetic or otherwise.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said. At least he didn\u2019t start sucking again. But he suddenly waxed eloquent. \u201cDon\u2019t have a nanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a nanny,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cRight. The nanny, her name was Peg\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe nanny\u2019s name was Peg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, her name was Peg and her brother was sent to Bridewell Prison because he stole a sow and her piglets and then he stole a butter churn and put the piglets in it.\u201d</p><p>He paused, but Roberta had no comment about the butter churn or the piglets, and his sentence was reasonably grammatical.</p><p>So they continued like that down the hall and around the curve, with Roberta occasionally interjecting a grammatical comment, and Teddy telling her at length about various criminal deeds. Some of his stories were rather involved and, had Roberta not had a great deal of experience in decoding cryptic literature, might have been misinterpreted.</p><p>\u201cDo I understand you to say,\u201d she said some time later, \u201cthat the housemaid with the beard, whose name is Carper, is married to a wild bog-trotting croggie, whatever that is, but she has a child by a Captain Longshanks?\u201d</p><p>Teddy corrected her. Apparently Carper had a mustache as well, and the signal point of his story was that she had more facial hair than the captain.</p><p>To Roberta, the more interesting point was the wild bog-trotting croggie.</p><p>Teddy admitted that he couldn\u2019t describe Carper\u2019s husband, but launched into a tale of Carper\u2019s sister, who bought an ointment entitled the Tomb of Venus, which gave her a terrible swelling.</p><p>\u201cA dire name. She should have chosen something more propitious.\u201d</p><p>After she had explained the meaning of dire and propitious, and finally, tomb, Teddy said that the swelling was all in front, and Carper said that it was an ill-prepared medicine and that Dr. Jackson\u2019s worm powder would have been better.</p><p>Finally she saw the great winding stair leading down the central core of the house, so she told Teddy to run off to his nursery.</p><p>He blinked up at her and then popped his thumb back in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too old for that,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhy, you must be ten years old at the very least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix,\u201d he said around his thumb.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a disgusting habit,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are those who take worm powder and rub it in children\u2019s thumbs and after that they never put them in their mouths again.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cShoo,\u201d she said. \u201cOr I\u2019ll tell your father about worm powder.\u201d</p><p>He ran.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cA n intimate family supper,\u201d Jemma said with obvious satisfaction. \u201cHow I missed this while in Paris!\u201d</p><p>She was sitting at the head of the table, looking as enticing as a French bird of paradise and not at all like a good huswife. Damon grinned at her. \u201cDomesticity is a new affectation for you.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cBeaumont, do you find that age is reconciling you to domesticity? You used to dine at home very rarely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beaumont was playing the majestic duke with particular fervor this evening; Damon couldn\u2019t blame him after the scene this afternoon.</p><p>\u201cI shall, of course, make every effort to domesticate myself now that you have returned from Paris,\u201d the duke said. His teeth closed around a bite of partridge with an audible snap.</p><p>Damon hadn\u2019t spent much time around feuding marital couples, but he judged the best thing to do was change the subject. Jemma beat him to it.</p><p>\u201cI suggest we exert ourselves to make a plan for Roberta\u2019s marriage,\u201d she said, throwing her new ward a smile.</p> <p>Damon didn\u2019t see much need for a plan. Lady Roberta was wearing one of the most unattractive gowns Damon had ever seen, but she herself was utterly delicious. Beautiful, even given that gown. What made her devastating, though, was not her looks, but the mixture of na\u00efvet\u00e9 and wit in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAfter all,\u201d Jemma said, warming up to her subject. \u201cShe has thrown me a challenge. Beaumont\u2014\u201d</p><p>But her voice cut off and Damon saw that Beaumont had put down his fork and had picked up a sheaf of paper handed to him by a footman.</p><p>\u201cMy deepest apologies,\u201d he said. \u201cI must answer this dispatch immediately. If you will forgive me, Your Grace, I will read it now, since this is such an informal family meal.\u201d There was only the slightest chill of irony in his tone.</p><p>\u201cA challenge doesn\u2019t quite cover it,\u201d Damon said, throwing himself into the silence that billowed down the table from Jemma\u2019s seat.</p> <p>\u201cAm I such an antidote?\u201d Roberta asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do,\u201d he said, grinning at her. \u201cThe problem is Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely the Duke of Villiers hasn\u2019t married since January?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Jemma said, dropping her wifely glare, presumably because her husband wasn\u2019t paying the slightest attention. \u201cVilliers is not married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d Roberta asked.</p><p>\u201cUnmarriageable,\u201d Damon said. She was a lovely little scrap, for all she\u2019d fallen in love with the wrong man. \u201cHe\u2019s a devil with women: beds them, leaves them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut surely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem is not that he\u2019s strewn a few children around the place,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cWhich he has. It\u2019s that he got at least one of those children on a gentlewoman and still didn\u2019t marry her. Do you see what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely to be attracted to a young miss, either,\u201d Damon put in. Though he had to admit that Roberta appeared to be a long way from the milk-and-water misses he associated with the label.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a mere miss!\u201d Roberta said, clearly revolted.</p><p>\u201cI think we are all happily coming to that realization,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cReeves breed true,\u201d Damon said. \u201cHere, I\u2019ve got an idea. Why don\u2019t you go to an inn and wait until a different fellow comes along to fall in love with? I could drive up with my matched grays. Any number of people have fallen in love with them.\u201d</p><p>But she shook her head. \u201cI will never love anyone but the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Roberta was obviously head over heels; there was a thrill in her voice at the mention of Villiers. Damon took a bite of his partridge. Of course he wasn\u2019t offended that she rejected his offer to replace Villiers out of hand. Not that he even got to make the offer.</p> <p>\u201cThe only thing I can think of is the old-fashioned ploy of putting Villiers in your way as much as possible, starting with the ball,\u201d Jemma said. Her eyes were thoughtful. \u201cIn a way, this is the ultimate challenge: to marry off Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe manly code of loyalty probably means I should warn him,\u201d Damon said. \u201cHis days of peace are numbered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers is everything I could wish for in a husband.\u201d Roberta\u2019s hands were clasped in her lap and she had a revolting look of adoration on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t set yourself an easy task, did you?\u201d Damon said, wanting to needle her. \u201cNot only is he filthy rich, titled and one of the top chess players in England, if not the world\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing worse would be if you had fallen in love with Damon,\u201d Jemma said, interrupting. \u201cI can hardly believe it myself, but my brother is one of the most sought-after bachelors in London.\u201d</p><p>Damon didn\u2019t care for his sister\u2019s incredulous look. It was even more annoying to see an echo of it in Roberta\u2019s eyes. \u201cI was invited to the Cholmondelay ball, and had I attended, I would have fought off my admirers to dazzle you,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cVanity is one of the seven deadly sins,\u201d Roberta said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cLust is another,\u201d he replied. \u201cIf I have one, I might as well have the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom that point of view, one might think you indulge in gluttony as well.\u201d She cast a nasty calculating eye at his waist, and his sister followed suit.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about that yet,\u201d he told her. \u201cNot like Villiers, who has to be on the far side of thirty. Likely getting a bit soft around the waist...just look at his hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sin of jealousy!\u201d Jemma cried, clapping her hands.</p><p>\u201cI pick and choose my sins like my lovers,\u201d Damon retorted. \u201cSloth yes, gluttony no. The more important point is that you,\u201d he told Roberta, \u201care joining a pack of young women similarly lusting after Villiers, and will have to knock them out of your way somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop being pessimistic,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine he is so sought-after. I haven\u2019t seen Villiers for years, but there\u2019s something almost feminine about him, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Damon said, at the same time that Roberta protested, \u201cNot at all!\u201d</p><p>Jemma shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re used to obvious types,\u201d Damon said. He cast a look at Beaumont, but the duke was deaf to the world, absorbed in his dispatch. \u201cThe kind who wears black, boxes for sport, knows his way around a stableyard and has broken a horse or two\u2014or at least fibs about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I may not always defend my husband,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cif Beaumont ever said that he broke a horse, it would be the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that,\u201d Beaumont said suddenly. The gravity of his voice broke into their conversation like a bang of a judge\u2019s gavel. He turned the page without looking up. \u201cPlease disregard my presence. I merely caught those critical words: my husband.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s smile hardened. She turned to Roberta. \u201cThere was a very awkward moment early in our marriage when I asked my husband if he loved his mistress and he told me the truth.\u201d</p><p>Damon opened his mouth but Roberta rushed to the rescue. \u201cI have spent much of my life listening to my father\u2019s protestations of love,\u201d she said. \u201cI am extremely tired of men in love. It turns them to fools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ever told you that I was in love with my mistress,\u201d Beaumont said, still not raising his eyes from the sheaf of papers before him, \u201cI must have been mistaken.\u201d</p><p>Jemma ignored him. \u201cI see just what you mean, Roberta. There is something unseemly about a man in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father is a poet,\u201d Damon said, \u201cand if you\u2019ll forgive me, Villiers is an altogether more complex creature. He\u2019s intrigued by clothing, and likes to wear rose colors because they look splendid with his hair, which is going white.

Villiers may not flaunt his sword, so to speak, but it\u2019s all the more evident for being sheathed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that Villiers has fallen in love?\u201d Beaumont asked, sounding genuinely surprised.</p> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d Damon said. \u201cThe man doesn\u2019t give a damn about women, or propriety, the niceties of life in London, or any of that claptrap. He behaves in an egregious manner and yet he is invited everywhere. It\u2019s one of the mysteries of life. Another such mystery would be how you, my dear Lady Roberta, are possibly going to get him to give a damn about you.\u201d</p><p>Jemma shot him a frown and Beaumont\u2019s eyebrow shot up.</p><p>Why the hell was he insulting Lady Roberta? Damon couldn\u2019t quite explain it, but the idea of this delicious girl chasing after Villiers made his blood curdle.</p><p>\u201cI shall keep your good wishes in mind,\u201d Roberta said, not turning a hair. \u201cI think that the duke and I are suited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuited!\u201d Damon said. \u201cNot unless you turn into a chess piece on alternate Sundays.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t even pause. \u201cI can work on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an education having you with us,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cCreativity must run in the family. Perhaps your father can write a poem for Damon\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat wedding?\u201d he enquired.</p><p>\u201cThe one I\u2019m going to arrange for you. It\u2019s past time you were married. It would have prevented the debacle of Flora\u2019s declaration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met a single young woman I could contemplate marrying. Most of the ones currently on the market have brains like the mills of God.\u201d He sighed, faced with two blank female faces.</p><p>\u201cThe mills of God grind exceedingly slowly,\u201d Beaumont put in. \u201cI gather Lord Gryffyn is issuing an obscure insult to young women\u2019s intelligence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is the very reason why you have reached the ripe, if not over-ripe, age of twenty-nine without marrying,\u201d Jemma told her brother. \u201cYour jokes are obscure, and your belief in your own intelligence is far too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has nothing to do with my intelligence,\u201d he protested.</p><p>\u201cWhat does it have to do with?\u201d Roberta asked with some curiosity. \u201cAre you holding out for a bluestocking?\u201d</p><p>Jemma leaped to his rescue. \u201cDamon\u2019s problem is that he\u2019s been the most eligible bachelor on the market for, oh, at least five years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was the Duke of Fletcher,\u201d Damon put in gloomily, \u201cbut he married Perdita Selby and left me to the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wolves being matchmaking mamas,\u201d Jemma translated.</p><p>\u201cAnd their daughters. It wasn\u2019t Mrs. Hickman who had the idea of locking me in a privy with her daughter until we were compromised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have been Mr. Hickman,\u201d Jemma said.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cElinor herself. She as good as told me so. After all, when you spend several hours in extremely intimate\u2014and odiferous\u2014circumstances, all sorts of revelations come to light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many young women have marked their first year in London by falling violently in love with my brother,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>Roberta blinked at Damon.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jemma said, \u201chard to believe, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhat,\u201d Roberta said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hesitate to insult me,\u201d Damon retorted.</p><p>\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t mean to imply that you were less than handsome,\u201d Roberta said hastily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as well that you\u2019re immune to his charms. It would be all too awkward if you joined the slavering hordes and were chasing Damon around the house with a knife in one hand and a ring in the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was only one young lady with a cutting implement,\u201d Damon said, \u201cand it was some sort of chisel for working in stone. Young Dulcit Pensington. In her first few months in London, she succumbed to a particularly virulent affection for me, and was determined to carve my head in sandstone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d Roberta caught back whatever word she meant. Probably odd, Damon thought. \u201cHow enterprising!\u201d she exclaimed.</p><p>She obviously had no interest in him. Which was all to the best, just as Jemma had pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDulcit is a very sweet girl,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cNot that I\u2019ve seen her since she was a child, but I\u2019m sure you have blown that chisel story out of all recognition, Damon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot I,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cFor at least two weeks I couldn\u2019t leave my house without a maddened sculptress leaping from behind a bush, chisel in hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgnore him,\u201d Jemma said to Roberta. \u201cWhen a man grows this convinced of his own beauty, there is no hope for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not convinced of my beauty,\u201d Damon protested.</p><p>\u201cWhat you need is a woman who doesn\u2019t even know you\u2019re alive,\u201d his sister told him. \u201cI shall dance a hornpipe on the day you meet her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fit encomium for marital bliss,\u201d Beaumont said, putting down his knife and fork. \u201cDancing to a tune one neither likes nor understands, with a partner who thinks you a cadaver.\u201d</p><p>As jokes go, that wasn\u2019t a bad one, though of course family loyalty meant that Damon couldn\u2019t laugh. Jemma was glaring again. Damon looked over at Roberta and saw an answering, secret smile in her eyes.</p><p>It seemed he could share a secret laugh with his new family member, which was comforting when he thought of sitting through more dinners like this one.</p><p>In fact, it was almost enticing.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>From the Duchess of Beaumont to the Duke of Villiers:</p><p>Though we haven\u2019t met in years, I should like to invite you to my ball tomorrow.

At least he didn\u2019t appear to be attired for bedroom matters. She was not prepared for that sort of intimacy with him. Not yet.</p><p>He strode over to the center of the room and stood there as if he were planning to make a speech in parliament. \u201cObviously, we have matters to discuss.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI actually wanted to ask you about your health,\u201d Jemma said, rather surprised to hear herself say the words.</p><p>Beaumont shrugged. \u201cMy doctor feels that I fainted as a result of overwork and general stupidity, rather than a signal problem with my heart. But I may have less time left than I would prefer, given my father\u2019s early demise.\u201d</p><p>That casual statement gave Jemma a slightly sick feeling; for all they lived apart, they were man and wife, after all. She nodded, and made her way over to a chair by the fire.</p><p>\u201cThat is one of the reasons why I must ask you to curb any injudicious activities,\u201d he said, obviously choosing his words with care. \u201cWe are at the beginning of a revolution in the House, to be led by young Pitt, and I would not want my private life to become a distraction.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to be waiting for a response, so she said, \u201cExperience has taught me that your idea of discussion is entirely one-sided, so you may continue as you wish, Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>He scowled but started to talk about propriety and parliament and other boring topics.

In truth, her husband was quite good-looking. It was a shame that he was impossible to live with.</p><p>\u201cJemma!\u201d</p><p>She stood up again. \u201cLet me itemize your demands. You want me to behave with utmost propriety in every situation. You would prefer that my brother not live in the house due to the presence of his illegitimate child. In fact, you may just have ordered me to send him away although I am hoping I misunderstood you. I should also dismiss my secretary. You would prefer I entertain no lovers, take in no brothers, and chatter with no friends. Have I understood you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome version of that would be very helpful to me. Do you agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d She walked over to her chess table and stared down at the game as if she were contemplating a move, though to tell the truth, her heart was beating quickly with rage.</p><p>He made a sharp movement behind her but said nothing.</p><p>She turned back to him, leaning against the table. \u201cMy brother has come to pay me a visit in a house that is mine as well as yours. Obviously, you have grown mightily in your own estimation during the years I lived in Paris. You did not used to be so unilaternal nor so tedious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI request\u201d\u2014he spat out the word\u2014\u201cthe very minimal that any man might expect of his wife. I ask only that you not have yourself carried naked into the dining room, nor\u2014\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cDid that story reach London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think it would not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, the truth matters little since the story arrived here with your name firmly attached to it, and all sorts of details regarding the size of the platter and the number of footmen required to hoist you into the air.\u201d His eyes raked her figure, up and down. \u201cI would have guessed that four footmen could have managed the business, but I\u2019m told it was eight.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cMy breasts and hips have grown since my salad days when you and I shared a bed. To be safe, I would have commandeered eight. But as a matter of fact, Catherine Worl\u00e9e was brought in on a silver dish, and it wasn\u2019t even at a party of mine. I\u2019m sure you would have enjoyed her company; she was something of a professional comrade to men of your ilk.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed to daggers. \u201cWhat a shame I never met her. Although I can imagine it would be confusing to be unable to tell my wife apart from a courtesan such as Mademoiselle Worl\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it would be confusing to you at all,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, you are accustomed to paying women for the privilege of sharing their bed, are you not? Whereas I\u201d\u2014her heart was beating so quickly she could hardly hear\u2014\u201cengage in the sport for pleasure.\u201d</p><p>He turned away. \u201cThis quarrelling will get us nowhere. All I am asking, Jemma, is that you not scandalize all of London. I have work in Parliament. I know you find it uninteresting, but it is important work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a time I found it interesting. But that was before I realized that your mistress found it so fascinating that she visited you in your office to discuss it.\u201d</p><p>He raked a hand through his hair. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Jemma, will you forget that? I\u2019m sorry that you opened the door. I still can\u2019t believe that the clerks let you into my office without warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever underestimate the charm of a young bride wishing to surprise her spouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have discussed this before,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cOne of the few pleasures of our marriage in the past years has been that we rarely quarreled during my visits to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuring those visits, you never questioned my decisions, nor acted ashamed of my entertainments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in Paris. Now you are here, in my house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house as well. I am home, and you will simply have to accustom yourself to that notion. I am home, with my disreputable friends, and my illegitimate nephew, and my entertainments. I am not a good political wife and I never will be. I will do my best, however, to tailor my flights of fancy to your hidebound notions. Luckily for you, I have no lover at the moment, nor do I intend to take one.\u201d</p><p>This would obviously be a good time to discuss the question of marital visits, but she was too angry. A mad, irresistible impulse was beating in her heart, a wish to make him sorry for describing her in such tawdry terms, for implying she was incapable of understanding politics.</p><p>There was a moment of stiff silence. Jemma sat down at her chess table, refusing to look at him again.</p><p>He walked over and looked down at the game. \u201cYou are playing, I see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have yet to find a partner in this country. Unless you would consider a return to the board?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy games of strategy take place on a larger stage.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head and met his eyes. They were black, marked by eyebrows that winged up at the edges. He had the straight nose and strong chin of his forefathers. \u201cI suppose that is designed to make me feel petty. I would remind you that women are allowed no role in those larger games of strategy. Perhaps I play chess because I am not allowed to play in a larger sphere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dull your life must be, to cherish one move all day,\u201d he said slowly, staring at the board. \u201cVery pretty. A deceptively placid position. Black has some powder left, but White is nicely set up.\u201d He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYour skill has indeed grown, Jemma. I take it your silence is an assent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have never been interested in my skill,\u201d she said, without pity. \u201cI see no reason to boast to you...I shall save my flights of self-congratulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith whom do you play? Have you a maid who knows the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Paris, I had partners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have all heard of those partners,\u201d he said, and his voice was very even. \u201cThe practice of a gentleman and lady playing chess in the privacy of a bedchamber only reached these shores in the last year.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow unfortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hoping to have the pleasure of setting all the dowagers\u2019 hair on end by starting the fashion myself. Since I have no partner in England, I play both sides of the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you make two moves a day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I play the other part, I am not myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would take it you are White, menacing Black\u2019s bishop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, \u201cI am Black.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou are White.\u201d</p><p>The laughter died.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea that I was playing,\u201d he said. \u201cLet alone that I would win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife is full of pleasurable surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I take my rook to Bishop Two?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you letting me win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t; you are winning fair and square. It was a beautiful set on your part: only five moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be very fair to play like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hard part is not being fair, but playing as if I am you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause?\u201d He looked at her, eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cYou are an excellent chess player. Better when I play you than you used to be on your own.\u201d</p><p>He gave a bark of laughter.</p> <p>\u201cGiven that proviso, I rarely win against you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, have we played often?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWhenever I am without another partner, I turn to you.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the rook. \u201cI am, then, a way station between partners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be confusing bed partners with chess partners,\u201d she said. \u201cMen who can play chess are so infrequently worth the time in bed. It takes a different kind of imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDescribe my play\u2014at chess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have foresight, detail and courage. Your fault is that you are not daring enough, but you excel in outwitting, cornering and demolishing your opponent.\u201d</p><p>He was silent a moment but she saw a smile in his eyes. \u201cI think my opponents in Lords would agree with you. Your play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am more brilliant, and more erratic. In our last four games, played by myself, of course, you have won three. I tend to take far too much delight in risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow interesting that by pretending to be me you curb your own impetuosity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself impetuous,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI assure you that when I win, my moves are beautiful. I frequently win, except when I play you. Monsieur Philidor was the only person who beat me on a regular basis, but I also beat him, many times.\u201d</p><p>She felt his eyes on her, but refused to look up again. When he spoke again, his voice was rather stifled. \u201cI realize that you didn\u2019t have to return to London, and that you left a great deal behind you in Paris, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am grateful.\u201d The words seemed reluctant.</p><p>\u201cIt is no more than my duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI confess that I am reluctant to see the estate go to my nephew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still as foolish as ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wears a great quantity of false hair,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cFalse teeth, and\u2014so he tells me\u2014pads his stockings to give himself a proper leg. So false legs as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not yet ready to engage in the intimacies that will lead to an heir,\u201d Jemma said, still not looking at him. \u201cI am accustomed to pleasure for its own sake. Nor am I happy about the inevitable unpleasantness involved in carrying a child. Perhaps after the season. We can retire to the country.\u201d And won\u2019t that be fun, she thought.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cI am at your convenience.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>April 11</p><p>Nine o\u2019clock</p><p>Beaumont House</p><p>T here hadn\u2019t been such excitement over a ball since Princess Charlotte attended her first public f\u00eate at Windsor Castle. Though many were certain that the Duchess of Beaumont would lose her reputation within weeks of arriving in London\u2014after all, they\u2019d all heard stories of the many lovers she deserted in Paris\u2014she had not yet been rejected from society, and thus everyone with an invitation was free to attend.</p><p>\u201cWe have to take advantage of it,\u201d Miss Charlotte Tatlock said to her sister May. \u201cLord knows, the duchess may be persona non grata by next week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t speak in riddles,\u201d May replied. She was looking out the carriage window, trying to see whose coach was following theirs.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a riddle; it\u2019s Latin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no difference. And besides, I know why you wish to attend the ball, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the pleasure of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re hoping that her uncle will have come to town to see his niece. Lord Barnabe Reeve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had forgotten about him,\u201d Charlotte said, less than truthfully. \u201cDidn\u2019t he retire to the country? Of course he won\u2019t be there. You know as well as I do that he\u2019s not right in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike all the Reeve family,\u201d May said. \u201cDid you hear that the duchess is bringing the daughter of the Mad Marquess into society? I expect there are bets in White\u2019s about her eccentricities, to put it kindly. Naturally the Mad Marquess and the Reeves share some part of their family tree. It only makes sense.\u201d</p><p>May had the most annoying titter in the entire world. \u201cI want to see the duchess\u2019s arrangements,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI heard that she intends to serve a table of fruit embedded in Parma violets. I\u2019ve seen fruit embedded in moss; haven\u2019t we all? But violets? That must cost three hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am more curious to see her clothing,\u201d May said. \u201cThat is, if she wears any. She may repeat herself and be delivered on a platter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discount that tale entirely. It would be most uncomfortable, as one would be in constant danger of falling to the ground.\u201d</p><p>May looked unconvinced, but just then the carriage drew up in front of Beaumont House. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t tell me that you have forgotten the Duchess of Claverstill\u2019s ball. Not after making an exhibit of yourself dancing all night with Barnabe Reeve.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had a low opinion of her sister\u2019s intelligence, and this question did not improve it. How could she\u2014Charlotte\u2014have forgotten that ball? \u2019Twas the one at which she fell in love with Barnabe Reeve. Though he\u2019d never asked for her hand, and left London shortly thereafter, she hadn\u2019t forgotten.</p><p>There was a cacophony of noise around them as carriages unloaded and footmen shouted. May was dressed most becomingly in blue, with moderate hoops. Charlotte, who prided herself on being elegant, was resplendent in sprigged silk. Unfortunately, the best they could hope for in terms of compliments were words like becoming and resplendent. It was a far cry from the ball when Charlotte danced all night with Lord Barnabe Reeve, dance after dance, certain she would be married within months. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s enter, shall we?\u201d she said, adjusting her drape of Anglican lace around her elbows. \u201cWe have a duchess to see!\u201d</p><p>But in fact the first person they saw was not the duchess, but the duke.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s glowering,\u201d May whispered, as they approached the receiving line. \u201cI cannot think why Her Grace returned from Paris. They cannot be happy together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she was tired of France. I\u2019ve heard that it can be miserably hot in the summer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere must be something more to it,\u201d May murmured, with the kind of intensity that suggested she would spend the entire night talking of nothing else.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d the duke said, bowing before them.</p><p>They curtsied.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess has made her way into the ballroom,\u201d the duke said, looking glacially disapproving. \u201cI know she will be most happy to see you, Miss Tatlock, Miss Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d May whispered as they hurried past him. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t be more forbidding, could he? Is that Villiers on the other side of the room? It can\u2019t be. He never speaks to Beaumont.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe might know the duchess...How interesting that would be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Sometimes May was quite dense. \u201cIf Villiers made a set at Beaumont\u2019s wife,\u201d Charlotte said patiently. \u201cVilliers hasn\u2019t a mistress at the moment, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would know? The only thing that man really cares about is chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but he seems to cut a wide swathe through the female half of the ton in between matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so rude!\u201d May said. \u201cI simply can\u2019t abide him.\u201d She plumped up her hair. \u201cPerhaps I shall grant Muddle two dances tonight. Here he comes.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte groaned inwardly. Her older sister finally had a beau, Horace Muddle. I\u2019m happy for her, she thought. I\u2019m happy for her.</p><p>Why not be happy? They are both muddled and muddling; they will live together in happy muddlestown. And I shall live\u2014</p><p>She turned away. One of her friends was hailing her from the side of the room, so she smilingly made her way over to sit among the young matrons, all of whom were her age and spent an inordinately large amount of time discussing their offspring. At least to Charlotte\u2019s mind.</p><p>But not tonight.</p><p>\u201cDid you see what she\u2019s wearing?\u201d Lady Hester Vesey asked immediately.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her at all. She had left the receiving line and Beaumont was irritably doing the honors on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere she is,\u201d Hester breathed. \u201cOver to the right.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte took care not to appear to be staring. She straightened her wrap, and smiled at an acquaintance to the left, and then let her eyes drift in the other direction.</p> <p>The Duchess of Beaumont had dressed her hair very high in a mass of curls, marked by jeweled flowers. She was exquisitely gowned, so much so that Charlotte felt slightly faint with envy. Her gown was lemon-colored Italian silk, the petticoat puckered all over and sewn with roses.</p><p>\u201cDo you see who she\u2019s talking to?\u201d Hester whispered.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Charlotte said, her eyes narrowing as the duchess laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s Delacroix. I thought she had left him in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe followed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that her brother has moved into Beaumont House with his child?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s eyes opened at that. \u201cI\u2019m amazed the duke would allow such an irregularity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got everyone talking again about who the mother could be. Lady Piddleton claimed yesterday that she knew for a fact it was Mary Strachey\u2019s child. But then there\u2019s others who say his mistress took off for America and left him with the babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmerica? That seems unlikely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s what everyone says. I can\u2019t imagine why he didn\u2019t simply stow it in the country like any decent man would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him with Mary Strachey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means nothing,\u201d Hester said, with irrefutable logic. \u201cHer acquaintances are legion, as it says in the Bible, or at least it says something like that. Your sister is looking very intimate with Muddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for a wedding in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext we must turn to you,\u201d Hester said comfortably. \u201cIt\u2019s never too late!\u201d</p><p>Charlotte silently ground her teeth. \u201cI live in hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that might be\u2014\u201d</p><p>But whatever bit of wisdom Hester was going to offer was swept away as her husband bowed before her and bore her off onto the dance floor, ignoring her protests. \u201cThere\u2019s a chess game brewing between Corbin and Villiers,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m not missing that, so we\u2019re having our dance now.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sighed. There was nothing very appealing about the marriages she saw around her, but it was hard not to long for a spouse anyway. She sat still and tried to look as if she wasn\u2019t alone. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be used to it. A few chords sounded...a polonaise was beginning.</p><p>Suddenly a pair of polished shoes stopped before her. \u201cIf you please?\u201d A gloved hand paused before her face...she looked up. It was the Duke of Beaumont.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, rising and curtsying deeply.</p><p>\u201cMiss Charlotte. May I have the pleasure of this dance?\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. Of course, he was a married man, but he was so dreadfully handsome. She rose and placed her hand in his. A moment later they were gravely pacing down the dance floor. Charlotte resisted looking about to see whether anyone had noticed she was dancing with the host.</p><p>Instead she looked up at him. Of course, he was famously short-tempered, and it would be foolish of her to provoke him. But then he achieved such remarkable things in the House of Lords.</p><p>She had two choices: they could engage in twenty minutes worth of silent dancing, or she could speak. He clearly considered his duty to end with the dance itself. \u201cI read the description of your recent speech in the House of Lords, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>He looked marginally more awake. \u201cIn the London Gazette? I\u2019m afraid that the majority agreed with the opposition, more\u2019s the pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you quite certain that you are right about Mr. Fox\u2019s intent to make the East India Company accountable to commissioners?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I certain that it\u2019s a blatant attempt to seize the Company\u2019s wealth for themselves? In a word: Yes.\u201d He didn\u2019t look very pleased by her question anymore.</p><p>\u201cI mention it because I was greatly struck by the wording of the actual bill. I am in sympathy with your wish to force an election, but should not companies be accountable? Someone must look over their shoulders, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Whigs look over the Company\u2019s shoulders only to seize its wealth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hard it is to tell the difference between an anti-corruption measure and greed,\u201d Charlotte said. \u201cIt did occur to me\u2014\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat occurred to you?\u201d He looked interested, bending down slightly, and Charlotte\u2019s heart thumped again. \u201cCurses, we\u2019re going to the end of the measure,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget your thought.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A moment later they were reunited. Charlotte looked at him over their raised hands. \u201cYou understand that I have only read the accounts in the Gazette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have been fairly accurate, which is unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that perhaps you might emphasize the question of treason in your next speech,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I understand it, you are trying to drum up support against Fox. But if I were you, I would swing this particular discussion to support for the King, rather than antagonism against the Secretary of State. Fox is so very popular.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI suppose I could. But Fox is the problem and he absolutely must be removed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell the House of Lords that anyone who votes for the bill would be regarded as the King\u2019s enemy. Don\u2019t even mention Fox.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he lost his step in the measure and then recovered. \u201cMiss Charlotte, I\u2019m grateful indeed that I asked for this dance.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s heart sped up again. He drew her to the side of the room. \u201cDid you have a chance to read the debate published in the Gazette between Lord Temple and Fox?\u201d</p><p>Roberta knew that she should be in the ballroom. She knew that all she had to do was walk down that last flight of stairs and she would enter the buzz and hum that was drifting through the house. She had been dressed for at least forty minutes.</p><p>The problem was that her dress was all wrong. She stared at herself in the mirror again. \u201cYou will be a perfect jeune fille,\u201d Jemma had told her that morning. \u201cWe\u2019ll dress you very simply, some rosebuds here and there, a strand of pearls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a jeune fille,\u201d Roberta had protested.</p><p>But Jemma had been firm. \u201cI realize that you are a Reeve at heart. But your first appearance in the ton must be as an exquisite bud of young innocence. Later you can show your true colors. After you\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Roberta sighed. She had dreamed of going to a ball. But it was difficult to pretend to be docile and modest. She tried casting down her eyes again. No one could be innocent who had lived with her father for long. She felt like a fool. A wolf in lamb\u2019s clothing.</p><p>Just then the door burst open. \u201cThere you are,\u201d Jemma cried. \u201cYou look adorable!\u201d</p><p>Roberta looked back in the mirror. Her hair had been carefully curled and powdered by the lady\u2019s maid assigned to her. She was wearing pearls, and there were sprigs of apple blossom in her hair. Her panniers were large enough to be elegant, but not large enough that she would have trouble dancing in them. And she had just a faint shading of pink to her lips and her cheeks. She simpered at herself.</p><p>The only thing she really liked were her slippers: they were exquisite, and pink.</p> <p>That and the little patch high on her cheekbone.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like the way you\u2019re dressed, do you?\u201d Jemma asked, appearing at her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOh I do!\u201d Roberta said hastily. \u201cIt would be most ungracious of me to dislike it, and I promise that I love it. I\u2019ve never looked so wonderful in my life! In fact,\u201d she said in a burst of honesty, \u201cthis is the first time I\u2019ve ever worn powder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cItchy, isn\u2019t it? I avoid it whenever I can,\u201d Jemma said sympathetically, \u201cbut one\u2019s hair simply must be powdered on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly, I am so grateful, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>Jemma narrowed her eyes as she stared at the mirror. \u201cWhat do you wish you were wearing?\u201d</p><p>Roberta knew the proper answer to that. \u201cExactly what I am wearing! Shall we go downstairs now?\u201d</p><p>But Jemma was smiling. \u201cFancy yourself a s\u00e9ductrice, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Roberta caught another glimpse of the pretty shepherdess in the mirror. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d like to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that Villiers will be interested by maidenly docility,\u201d Roberta confessed. \u201cHe\u2019s not the type to court young girls, is he?\u201d</p><p>Jemma laughed. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what good is it to wear this clothing? It\u2019s not going to work with him,\u201d she said desperately. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t care about the rest!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to fool the ton before you take on Villiers,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThey are invariably sheep-like and once they get a fixed idea in their head, it\u2019s hard to move it. If you act in an innocent and demure manner tonight, that is how they will see you. All talk of your father\u2019s companions will die quickly. Then\u2014and only then\u2014will you receive invitations to the parties where you will find Villiers. He\u2019s downstairs, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Roberta felt a wave of dizziness that spread from her toes to her hair line.</p><p>\u201cSucceed tonight and tomorrow morning invitations will shower on your head. Villiers will be at most of them.\u201d</p><p>Roberta snatched her gloves. \u201cI am ready.\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled. \u201cBe docile.\u201d</p><p>Roberta simpered at her.</p><p>\u201cVery good,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cInnocent?\u201d</p><p>Roberta cocked her head to one side and gave her a brainless smile.</p><p>\u201cNot quite that innocent,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou are obviously quite accomplished at prevarication, though how you learned it while penned up in a house with a poet, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many opportunities to prevaricate when one lives with a poet,\u201d Roberta said. She walked down the stairs by herself, as the width of Jemma\u2019s skirts did not allow her to walk beside anyone. \u201cIt would not always have been advisable to inform my father of my true opinion of a given poem, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFibbing is an extremely useful sport,\u201d Jemma said. And as if to prove it, she paused just inside the ballroom door and introduced Roberta to a group of matrons as a close relative, whom she\u2019d known for years. Then she leaned closer and Roberta caught the word \u201cheiress.\u201d</p><p>One of the mothers produced her son, a lanky boy, out of thin air and introduced the two of them. Roberta obediently simpered at Lord Rollins and set off into the dance.</p><p>By an hour later, she felt fairly confident that all of London thought she was an innocent, albeit rich, maiden from the country.</p><p>\u201cWhich you are,\u201d Jemma said in passing. \u201cRemember the eleven peach trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need peach trees,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI\u2019m sure that Villiers has his own orchard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman should always have an auxiliary target, a man in the wings, as it were.\u201d</p><p>But Roberta had no man in the wings. Villiers was everything she wanted in a husband. She glimpsed him briefly, across the room, and her feeling of rightness was almost overwhelming. He was resplendent in a coat extravagantly embroidered with poppies, a cloth that might seem feminine on another man. But his dark, coiled features turned the delicacy to a jest.</p><p>She was no fool. Villiers wasn\u2019t going to be attracted by simpering innocence and powdered curls. If she meant to marry him, she would have to play a very tricky game indeed.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>J emma had to acknowledge that if her husband was beautiful, the Duke of Villiers wasn\u2019t. His face was long, with narrow cheeks and black eyebrows. He had a rakish look, like a buccaneer of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s time. He wore a patch high on his cheek, and his lips were the same deep red as the poppies on his coat. It made her consider lip color\u2014was that possible? Yet his hair was just pulled back carelessly from his forehead, unpowdered, no wig. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beaumont and Villiers were as dissimilar as night and day. Jemma surveyed Villiers from across the ballroom floor for an hour or so without approaching him. He didn\u2019t dance; he prowled. Elijah danced. She saw him doing his duty with every unattached woman in the room. The only woman in whom Villiers showed interest was Lady Nevill. Jemma didn\u2019t know her, other than by reputation, but she had to admit she was delicious, with her satiny smile and sleepy eyes.</p><p>Jemma bided her time. The whole business of avenging Benjamin\u2019s suicide had taken on its own pleasurable edge, giving her a flare of excitement. Would she seduce? Or would she merely beat him at chess? Or both? She danced near Villiers, and he didn\u2019t look at her.</p><p>Then, quite suddenly, those heavy-lidded eyes lifted and the shock of it went down her spine. The glitter in his eyes was that of a chess player, the same light she\u2019d seen in Philidor\u2019s eyes, but only when he watched her queen take his pawns.</p><p>She whirled away into the steps of the dance, and found her corset felt unexpectedly tight around her ribs. She looked one more time, and he was murmuring in the ear of Lady Nevill. He wasn\u2019t nearly as handsome as Beaumont, but he had an irresistibly wicked look that her straitlaced husband could never achieve.</p> <p>Roberta danced by, smiling beatifically at a young squire. He looked besotted, as well he might. Roberta raised a cynical eyebrow over his shoulder.</p><p>At that same moment, Jemma realized something. Her revenge wouldn\u2019t run parallel to Roberta\u2019s pursuit of Villiers. It would be an integral part of it. She, Jemma, would wrap up the man whom all London had tried to tame\u2014and deliver him to Roberta as part of Harriet\u2019s revenge.</p><p>Marriage laid the ground for a hundred\u2014nay, a thousand\u2014petty humiliations of the type that Harriet longed to visit on Villiers.</p><p>It was the ultimate revenge.</p><p>Suddenly Villiers was in front of her, eyebrow raised. \u201cA black bandit knight at your service.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot a king?\u201d</p><p>He took out a cheroot. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside, shall we?\u201d And without waiting for her response, he walked straight outside onto the balcony. He shook back his deep lace cuffs and lit the cheroot from a torch on the balcony. The light flickered against his face. His skin was startling clear and white against the black hair, sleekly pulled back from his face. No, he wasn\u2019t handsome.</p><p>And yet he wasn\u2019t the sort of man who would find himself in a friendly cuffing match with the lads down at the pub either. He was altogether more refined and intelligent. No wonder he was the best player in England.</p><p>Every instinct told her that he would be a powerful partner. For a moment she couldn\u2019t distinguish between the wish to play him and to have him. A challenge\u2014and what a challenge! Villiers was famous for drifting from woman to woman with limpid disinterest. If Roberta was to marry him, she would have to take the law into her own hands, or rather use the law on her side, because he would never propose due to love.</p><p>The truth was that he was in love...with chess. A man bound to the chessboard has little left over, as poor Harriet had found to her distress.</p><p>Villiers stood silently, drawing on his cheroot and watching her. Jemma said nothing. She disliked opening conversations. It was such an immediate way to give away one\u2019s strategy. Women, she found, were generally too eager to rush into flirtation.</p> <p>Instead, she turned and looked over the gardens. The great elms were putting out new leaves that looked almost blue because of swathes of bluebells planted beneath them.</p><p>\u201cBlack King by a smothered mate,\u201d came a drawling voice behind her.</p><p>\u201cAn old but pretty trick,\u201d she said, turning around. She was conscious of a slight feeling of disappointment. Did he really need to test her knowledge?</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d he said softly, watching her unblinkingly over the glowing end of his cheroot, \u201cthat I often walk into Parsloe\u2019s and find there is no one worth playing?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. What was his point? She rarely had a partner at her own level other than Philidor.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me, then, for seeming brash in my enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin, the Duke of Berrow, used to play a fine game,\u201d she said, testing him.</p><p>His whole face changed. His cheekbones hollowed and his eyes looked haunted. \u201cHe was a good match. Better five years ago...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas your skill fallen, as did his?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was best when I was twenty,\u201d he said, taking a long draw on his cheroot. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am best now,\u201d she said. It was the truth; she met his eyes and knew that he understood it.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Philidor make of you? I heard little of a female chess player in France though\u201d\u2014he paused\u2014\u201cI heard much of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find, if you travel to Paris to play him\u2014and you should\u2014that he is ranked among my lovers. We played almost every day, in my bedchamber, at a table beside my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it he had no interest in that bed,\u201d Villiers said. His eyes were dark, too dark to read.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said tranquilly. \u201cWe would play a game, or sometimes make a match last by playing only one move a day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been a remarkable pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you play otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally, I play myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll by yourself?\u201d he asked, and suddenly she was unsure whether he was talking of chess or bedroom matters.</p><p>\u201cLife is so much less complicated by oneself,\u201d she said, sighing.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201d he said. The smoke drifted past his eyes. \u201cI find partners at Parsloe\u2019s or White\u2019s. I would prefer to play with strangers\u2014or those with less skill\u2014than find myself holding my own pawn in the safety of my bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference between a man and a woman perhaps,\u201d she said. \u201cFor myself, I find that my knowledge of chess comes from long moments of self-study.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at that, the flash of a tiger\u2019s white teeth when it spots its prey.</p><p>\u201cI think this game will be very interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause there is to be a game between us, is there not?\u201d</p><p>She held his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s make it a match. Two out of three games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a formidable opponent,\u201d he said.</p><p>There was a rustle of the silk hangings and Elijah came onto the balcony, accompanying a young girl who was feeling faint, apparently. Her mother rushed after them.</p><p>Elijah glanced in Jemma\u2019s direction and froze. A second later, the girl was wilting in her mother\u2019s arms, and Elijah was standing beside them. \u201cWhat an inestimable pleasure,\u201d he said. \u201cMy boyhood friend enters my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be I,\u201d Villiers said indifferently. \u201cThe one you don\u2019t speak to. Your wife\u2014who invited me to your ball\u2014and I were just extolling the benefits of the solitary life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>They were like night and day. Beaumont burned with the raw intensity that fueled his political ambitions, that had propelled him to the most important cabinet place under the Prime Minister, that had given him the ear of the King. Villiers drooped against the balcony, his cheroot held in long, lean fingers, his eyelids half open. He had a frown line between his brows and wrinkles by his eyes. Yet Beaumont still looked as he had in his early twenties, though he surely had as many late nights in politics as Villiers did in gaming. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe tells me,\u201d Villiers said, \u201cthat she beat Philidor many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, Philidor beat me as many times,\u201d Jemma remarked.</p><p>Elijah lifted an eyebrow. \u201cYou must have improved.\u201d</p><p>A slow burn went through Jemma\u2019s chest. Since her husband had played her only a few times, in the earliest days of their marriage, how could he know whether she had improved? She said nothing.</p> <p>Villiers\u2019s eyes slid back to her like sweet honey. \u201cOur match is on, then?\u201d he said, flicking his cheroot into the air. It flew through the evening sky like a glowing spark, landing on the gravel path below. Of course Elijah\u2019s eyes followed it. He would never do such a thing. Why make work for a servant or possibly cause a fire?</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cShall we play one move a day? The match will be slower, but all the more satisfying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a tie with the first two, the last game blindfolded.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help a little smile at that. She had played herself blindfolded, but it would be much better to have an opponent.</p><p>Villiers bowed with careless ease. His coat was as beautiful as one worn by the finest dandy in Paris.</p> <p>Elijah was in unrelieved black.</p><p>When Villiers walked away, Jemma saw that his hair was tied back with a poppy-red ribbon. It looked shocking against the dark silk of his hair. He must be setting his own fashion; in Paris men used only black ribbons.</p><p>\u201cWhere will you play chess with him?\u201d Elijah asked. His voice was even, but his eyes were burning with rage.</p><p>Jemma mentally shrugged. Elijah was a creature of anger. \u201cI suspect I shall play him precisely where I played Philidor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my bedchamber.\u201d</p> <p>With some pleasure she watched his eyes smolder. \u201cAnd the prize?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again, one languid movement that showed her shoulder to creamy advantage. Though why she should bother with such a thing around her husband, she didn\u2019t know. \u201cNeed there be a prize?\u201d she asked, and made to leave.</p><p>But he was blocking her way. He\u2019d grown bigger in the past eight years. When she had left England, he had lean legs and large shoulders. But now he had turned into a proper man. Jemma pushed away that thought with irritation.</p><p>\u201cI gather that you are the prize?\u201d To do him credit, his voice was silky.</p><p>\u201cI am no prize of any man\u2019s,\u201d she said, meeting his eyes to make sure that he understood. \u201cI\u2019m a free gift...to those upon whom I choose to bestow myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA gift many times given is cheapened by its traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt seems to me I\u2019ve heard that before. Yes! It must have been in church. How unusual to find a politician quoting the catechism. Perhaps you missed your calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are playing chess with him\u2014\u201d Beaumont said, and paused.</p> <p>Jemma was already past him, but she stopped. And then turned, slowly. \u201cYou would play chess with me simply because I have scheduled a match with Villiers? Surely you jest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCannot a man play a game with his wife?\u201d His mouth was set in a firm line. \u201cI see nothing particularly interesting about the fact.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAnd will it be on the same terms? One move a day for each of us; best of three games; final game is blindfolded, if played at all?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cBut Beaumont, you have not played chess, to the best of my knowledge, in years. Is it not ill-advised to wager so much on a rusty skill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I wager? As you say, there is no prize.\u201d</p><p>She closed her lips. Far be it from her to point out that he played from the dislike he felt for Villiers. \u201cYou\u2019d have to speak to me civilly,\u201d she pointed out, \u201cand come home every day to play. As I understand it, there are many nights when you sleep in your chambers.\u201d</p><p>They both knew that he did not sleep alone when he stayed in his apartments in Westminster.</p><p>But he shrugged. Of course, a man in his thirties was presumably not quite as active as a man in his twenties. The day she discovered him on the desk with his mistress, he had risen from her bed but a few hours earlier. It was rather dismaying to realize that the memory still gave her a moment\u2019s heartache, even so many years later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll play you,\u201d she said over her shoulder. \u201cBut I shall allow you a handicap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need no handicap.\u201d He said it evenly.</p><p>The memory of that day was still like a coal under her breastbone, so she smiled at him. \u201cTo make our match a challenge.\u201d</p><p>There was a faint color, high in his cheek, that betold rage. But Elijah was much better at containing himself than he had been when they were young.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said steadily. \u201cRemember: when you play as me, I frequently win. I would venture to say that I can equal that performance.\u201d</p><p>Either he thought to humiliate her, or he completely underestimated her current skill. The latter made much more sense.</p><p>She curtsied. \u201cBy all means, Your Grace. Shall we begin the game tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is an important vote in Lords. But I suppose Villiers will lose no time attending you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen rarely do, once I admit them into my presence.\u201d</p><p>He bowed. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>T he news spread throughout the ballroom within a few minutes. The Duchess of Beaumont was engaged in two chess matches: one with her husband\u2019s enemy, the Duke of Villiers, and the second with her husband himself.</p><p>\u201cThey say,\u201d May said at one in the morning, \u201cthat she\u2019s a remarkably fine chess player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps that\u2019s the case,\u201d Charlotte said, thinking of the intense eyes of the duke. \u201cBut she\u2019s making a fool of herself to play with Villiers.\u201d</p><p>May laughed. \u201cThen you must be settling into old age indeed, sister. Even I can see that Villiers is a man to savor.\u201d She looked slightly startled, as if such a word could not have come from her lips.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess\u2019s young ward, Lady Roberta, seems entirely acceptable,\u201d Charlotte said, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cYes, a na\u00efve little slip of a girl, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Charlotte realized that May was gazing at her hand. And there, crammed over her glove, was a signet ring.</p><p>A ring.</p><p>It seemed that she would now be the only old maid in the Tatlock family. She snapped out of her momentary bleakness, embraced her sister and said all the proper things. In the flurry of congratulations, the docile young ward of the Duchess of Beaumont was quite forgotten.</p><p>In truth, Roberta had been forgotten by most of the players of this comedy. She obediently circled the ballroom throughout the night, moving from one gentleman\u2019s arms to another. At first she danced like a feather, and later she began weaving a bit because her toes hurt.</p><p>She retreated to the ladies\u2019 retiring room because Jemma\u2019s exquisite French slippers caused blisters, not because she had no one to dance with.</p><p>A whole flock of girls were there, chattering like magpies. Their voices died when she walked in.</p><p>But then a girl with a sweet, plump face stood up and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Margery Rowlandson; we met earlier this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d Roberta said, and curtsied.</p><p>Margery introduced her to everyone, and soon she was a part of the giggling group. One girl who couldn\u2019t be more than sixteen was expecting an offer on the morrow; another had danced twice with a young courtier. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so lucky!\u201d Margery exclaimed, turning back to Roberta. \u201cI just realized that you are staying in Beaumont House, aren\u2019t you? That means you are living in the same house with Lord Gryffyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is here,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>\u201cAlong with his\u2014his\u2014his\u2014\u201d Roberta thought her name was Hannah. She was giggling so hard that she couldn\u2019t voice it. Among the foolish, she would take a crown, to Roberta\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cHis son is in the house as well,\u201d she said evenly.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can!\u201d a shrill voice said. \u201cWhy, my mother said that if she\u2019d known of his presence, she might not have let me come to this ball at all!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only a child of six years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t met him!\u201d That was Margery, her eyes round with horror.</p><p>\u201cI met him briefly and there was no sight of devil\u2019s horns anywhere,\u201d Roberta said gravely. \u201cBut then, I do not care for children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d the shrill-voiced girl said. \u201cEspecially ones of this nature, who should be kept out of sight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if Lord Gryffyn does have an illegitimate son,\u201d Margery sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s so adorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose one could think that,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI believe I prefer someone older...say the Duke of Villiers?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of horrified silence.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t anyone told you of his reputation?\u201d Hannah gasped. \u201cStay away from him!\u201d She punctuated each word with a stabbing motion of his finger. \u201cStay away! You haven\u2019t a mama who can tell you these things. Stay away from him!\u201d</p><p>Roberta almost fell back a step. \u201cI will. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Never had she felt more lonely.</p> <p>The girls all took her for precisely what she appeared to be: a docile young heiress, brought from the country to be launched onto the marriage market under the aegis of her cousin the Duchess of Beaumont.</p><p>Their mothers seemed equally accepting. The dreadful illustrated pictures of her and her father in Rambler\u2019s Magazine were brought up several times, but only by kind matrons intent on reassuring her that no one knew of their existence.</p><p>All night Roberta danced and looked for the Duke of Villiers. Then, finally, she curtsied to a partner who had trodden all over her wounded toes, turned away and there he was.</p><p>\u201cYou must forgive me,\u201d he said. His deep, purring voice went through her like a bolt of lightning. \u201cI might almost have knocked you down.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather you are a new lamb brought to languish in the London season. Or to triumph over it, as the case may be. Do tell me your name, now we meet again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Roberta St. Giles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father died some years ago,\u201d he said, in a striking non sequitur. \u201cI can only suppose that yours has come to some unfortunate end since you are consigned to the duchess\u2019s tender care.\u201d</p> <p>She raised her chin. \u201cMy father is enraptured by the duchess\u2019s kindness toward me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we dance? It will come near to ruining your reputation, I should warn you. But I believe I already gave you a warning, did I not?\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cIndeed? I must have forgotten.\u201d</p><p>He knew she was lying, but she thought he liked it. \u201cI never seduce impoverished young ladies,\u201d he said, his voice silky and sweet, \u201cbut I am more than available for young ladies of ample means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe,\u201d she said, allowing just the right amount of time to pass, \u201cthat my virtue can withstand the assault of partnering you in one dance. But it is so reassuring to know that if I am overcome by a desire for ruination, you are willing to accommodate. It warms the heart.\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head at that and let out a peal of laughter. \u201cHoist with my own petard! I deserved that. Come on, then. You\u2019re not as wholesome as you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I gather that chastity would set no edge on your appetite, I shall not pretend to horror and dismay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Rape of Lucrece,\u201d he observed. \u201cDo you play Lucrece then, with beauty and virtue striving in your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an armada in full battle. Absolutely not. Had I been Lucrece, that dagger would have made its home in Tarquin\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBravo! But have no fear, Lady Roberta, I have never yet had to lower myself to Tarquin\u2019s violent tactics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cIt\u2019s useful to know that ruination does not always result in feeling like a polluted prison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA terrible use of alliteration on Shakespeare\u2019s part,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cI assure you, Lady Roberta, that ladies leave my care as assured of their own divinity as they were the day before. If perhaps slightly more so. I find\u2014don\u2019t you?\u2014that pleasure is a divine gift.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the ballroom. The main pleasure on Roberta\u2019s mind was the slightly hungry way in which other women looked at Villiers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you play chess, do you?\u201d he asked suddenly. \u201cI am finding myself rather surprised in that respect this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never played the game,\u201d she said. The chess board had languished in her father\u2019s drawing room forever; it had never occurred to her to study it. If only she had known it was so crucial to London entertainments.</p><p>He seemed to guess at her thoughts. \u201cAlmost no one in this house\u201d\u2014he nodded at the brilliant silks crowding the dance floor\u2014\u201ccan play the game worth a damn, if at all. It is only I, and perhaps your hostess, who seem to have a curious affinity for it.\u201d</p><p>They paused just inside the ballroom, waiting for a new measure.</p><p>Villiers seemed to feel no need to entertain her. He dropped her arm; when she looked at him he was exchanging looks with a young matron who had an entire ship balanced on top of her hair.</p><p>\u201cA nautical miracle,\u201d he murmured, seeing that she had followed his eyes. \u201cAnd Madame Moore is so very light herself that it\u2019s a miracle she doesn\u2019t capsize more often.\u201d</p><p>He was bored by her, and why shouldn\u2019t he be? \u201cAs I understand it, light frigates are very easy to board,\u201d Roberta said, unrolling her fan and fluttering it before her face. \u201cI assume that is an attraction for those too clumsy to attract a less sluggish vessel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely unexpected depths,\u201d he said, and there was a strain of amusement in his deep voice that made her lightheaded. A strain of trumpets signaled the beginning of a minuet. He bowed before her; she snapped shut her fan, and curtsied. The steps of the dance kept them apart, turning toward him and his heavy lidded eyes, turning away. Her breath was coming quickly.</p><p>At the end of the dance he gathered her hands, kissed both of them, and made a magnificent leg. \u201cMy title, Lady Roberta, is the Duke of Villiers. I fancy I may see you one of these days, as I have undertaken to play a prolonged chess match with your hostess.\u201d</p><p>Of course she knew he was the top chess player in London; but now it occurred to her that he was deeply competitive in all things. And that such competitiveness was a weakness.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI wish you luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn seeing you, or in playing chess?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She let her eyes slide away from him. She was playing the game of her life, and it would never do to appear eager. \u201cIn chess, of course, my lord. I am frequently absent from the house, and would not wish to raise your hopes that I shall choose to be ruined, as you so charmingly offer.\u201d</p><p>She turned and then glanced over her shoulder, caught sight of his white teeth\u2014he was laughing\u2014and slid into the crowd. So far she had been dancing rather indolently with whomever presented himself. But now she realized that in order to catch Villiers she must be the very top of the ton. The catch of the season. The most desired of all marriageable women.</p><p>He would have to win her over the hands of many men\u2014or he would show no interest whatsoever.</p><p>Jemma\u2019s brother appeared before her around an hour later. She had three young lords vying to offer her gingerbread wafers and champagne. In comparison to Villiers, they were easy to enchant. All three of them were giving her swooning looks, and judging from the sullen glances she\u2019d had from young ladies, she was plucking chickens meant for someone else\u2019s supper.</p> <p>Damon cut her from the crowd adroitly, which she rather appreciated because it was good for her swains to see that she wasn\u2019t theirs for the asking.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked. He nipped out of the ballroom and down a corridor that she hadn\u2019t even known existed.</p><p>\u201cTo my sister\u2019s sitting room,\u201d he said, grinning down at her. \u201cBack way.\u201d</p><p>He pushed open a door and sure enough, there were the mustard yellow walls (minus Judith and her platter). But just as Roberta entered, she realized that the room was not unoccupied.</p><p>Directly before her, leaning over the arm of a chair, was a woman. All she could see was a creamy, rounded bottom because the lady\u2019s violet skirts had been tossed over her head, undoubtedly so they wouldn\u2019t be crushed. There was a gentleman there, of course, and he was\u2014</p> <p>He was doing her a service.</p><p>Roberta clapped a hand over her mouth and froze. Behind her, she heard Damon\u2019s low chuckle.</p><p>Roberta just stared. It was almost violent and yet strangely intoxicating. The man was caressing his partner at the same time that he...well, he...The woman, whoever she was, was clearly enjoying herself, given the noise she was making. Roberta didn\u2019t recognize the gentleman; he was rather tubby. But she couldn\u2019t help noting that his thighs were strong, and he too was obviously most happy, and as she watched he shaped his partner\u2019s bottom in his hands and pulled her higher and\u2014</p><p>Damon\u2019s arm came around her waist and pulled her silently backwards into the corridor. He was still laughing as he closed the door. Roberta didn\u2019t feel in the least like laughing. She felt odd, as if all the air had been crushed out of her lungs.</p><p>Damon peered at her in the dim light of the corridor. \u201cShocked you to the bottom of your boots, I see. Come along then. We\u2019ll go to the library; there\u2019ll be no one there because it\u2019s so damned hard to find.\u201d He took her hand and pulled her along through a corridor and a turn, and finally through a door.</p><p>It was a monstrously big library, all lined with books and hung in somber crimson velvet.</p> <p>Roberta walked forward feeling slightly unsteady on her legs. There was a sofa before the fire, and Damon pushed her into it. \u201cA brandy, that\u2019s what you need,\u201d he said, going over to the sideboard.</p><p>He tumbled a few glasses about and said, over his shoulder, \u201cI take it that was the first tupping you were ever witness to?\u201d</p><p>Roberta opened her mouth but no sound came out.</p><p>\u201cPoleaxed,\u201d he said cheerfully, coming back and handing her a glass. \u201cDrink that.\u201d</p><p>Roberta took a fiery swallow and coughed. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Damon was laughing again. \u201cFirst brandy, first tupping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tup anyone,\u201d Roberta said, taking another sip. She quite liked brandy. Although it made her realize that her stomach was disconcertingly hot, and the drink only made it more so.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Damon said, throwing himself down next to her. \u201cSo, are you shocked, horrified, stricken to the bone?\u201d</p> <p>Roberta turned and looked at him. He was remarkably like his sister, though his hair was burnished a darker brown, whereas his sister\u2019s was golden. Not that she could see his hair under his wig. He had Jemma\u2019s eyes and her deep lower lip. \u201cIt\u2019s rather unkind of you to make jest of me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned unrepentantly. \u201cI don\u2019t see why you should be so horrified. It\u2019s entirely natural, after all.\u201d</p><p>But was it? Previous to this, Roberta thought she had the facts of procreation and marital intimacy firmly in mind. One of her father\u2019s courtesans had informed her that the man climbs on top of his partner, inserts his private part into the appropriate area, and continues. What exactly continuing meant was rather fuzzy to Roberta, but she certainly understood the mechanics.</p><p>Until this.</p><p>Because the mechanics might have been\u2014she had to suppose they were\u2014reproduced in a different position...</p><p>Under Damon\u2019s interested eyes she felt herself going pink in the cheeks. \u201cIt works in many different positions,\u201d he said helpfully.</p><p>At this evidence that he knew precisely what she was thinking about, she turned pinker still.</p><p>\u201cAny other questions? I am your cousin, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive times removed,\u201d Roberta said rather crossly.</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s more like seven,\u201d Damon said. \u201cAs I work it out in my head, you\u2019re about as much related to me as most of the people in the ballroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that I am taking advantage of your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jemma didn\u2019t want to bring you out, she wouldn\u2019t. Believe me, no one talks Jemma into doing a single thing that she doesn\u2019t care to. Thus, her eight years in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand why she came back to London?\u201d Roberta asked, desperate to change the topic to something other than tupping peers.</p><p>Damon stretched out his long legs. The current fashion for tight knee breeches suited him. His breeches were of a dark crimson and they made his legs, in cream stockings, look remarkably virile.</p><p>Roberta caught herself. What was she thinking? It was all the effect of seeing that performance in the sitting room. It made her feel peculiar. Most peculiar, she thought, realizing just what kind of messages her body seemed to be sending her.</p><p>\u201cShe has to make an heir,\u201d Damon said, \u201cbecause Beaumont might drop dead at any moment. He collapsed in the House last fall, didn\u2019t you hear? Fell to the ground and everyone thought he was dead. But he wasn\u2019t. Still, the prospect is not too pretty. Fainting is not a healthy man\u2019s activity. His father stuck his spoon in the wall at thirty-four due to something wrong with his heart. Beaumont is living on borrowed time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks healthy enough,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he? I\u2019m hoping it was an aberration. I like the man, and I think that it\u2019s better for Jemma to have him here to fight with, rather than buried, if you see what I mean. Did you meet the Duchess of Berrow, Jemma\u2019s friend? She was here yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Roberta shook her head.</p><p>\u201cShe used to be a smiling little thing, and then her husband died\u2014killed himself in truth\u2014and she\u2019s like a little bird with a broken wing now. You can\u2019t coax a smile for love or money.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow sad,\u201d Roberta said softly.</p><p>\u201cJemma had to return from Paris and do her wifely duty.\u201d</p><p>The words wouldn\u2019t have meant much to Roberta before this, but now she could feel herself getting pink again.</p><p>Damon\u2019s mouth curled into a wicked smile. \u201cI don\u2019t imagine Beaumont doing the business in the sitting room with his breeches at his ankles, do you? He\u2019s far too proper.\u201d</p> <p>A mad choke of laughter came from Roberta\u2019s chest. \u201cNo!\u201d Now Villiers...She felt almost feverish at the thought. Villiers she could easily see dragging down his breeches and turning someone over the arm of a chair.</p><p>There was a touch on her cheek and she turned, to find Damon looking at her. \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking about my brother-in-law,\u201d he said, his eyes slightly narrowed. \u201cSo who, my dear Roberta, cousin and relative, are you thinking of?\u201d</p><p>She gasped but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Villiers, isn\u2019t it? I forgot that you\u2019d already found the love of your life.\u201d</p><p>He still held her chin and it seemed to Roberta as if the world stopped spinning and froze, with the two of them but a hair\u2019s breadth from each other.</p> <p>\u201cOf course I was thinking of Villiers,\u201d she said, pulling backward. Pulling herself together.</p><p>He raised his glass to hers. \u201cTo many lazy afternoons spent in the drawing room with your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say such things,\u201d she scolded, taking another delicious sip from her glass.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He had green eyes. She\u2019d never realized that before; she thought they were blue, like those of his sister. But no, they were green, and beautifully shaped, with a little turn upward at the corners. \u201cBecause I am a young lady,\u201d she said, looking at the fire again.</p><p>\u201cI suppose that young ladies don\u2019t think about disreputable people tupping in drawing rooms?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you, Roberta, aren\u2019t you rather extraordinary among young women?\u201d There was a thread of laughter in his voice.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot at all.\u201d She almost choked when a large sip of fiery liquor went down the wrong way.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were...For one thing, I thought you told the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course I tell the truth,\u201d she said. She dared to look at him again. There was something different in his eyes, something daring and delicious and altogether not like the Damon of yesterday. She was shivering with excitement, and yet she hadn\u2019t the faintest impulse to leave the room. Which she ought to.</p><p>\u201cAs to the truth,\u201d he said, stretching out his legs again, \u201cI found the whole scene rather arousing. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think what to say. One had to suppose that arousing covered feelings like the queer warmth in her legs.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d he said, obviously thinking the conversation was no more important than an exchange over muffins. \u201cLady Piddleton ran my stockings.\u201d</p> <p>There was a large snag running through the clocks splashed on the outside of his stocking. And then she noticed that higher up, where his tight breeches turned into a waistband, there was\u2014</p><p>One had to pretend to be a virtuous young lady and not have even seen that.</p><p>\u201cWhat was she doing in such a position as to scratch them?\u201d Roberta asked, and then felt herself going purple as all sorts of thoughts as she\u2019d never had before came to mind. She stared at the mantelpiece so that she wouldn\u2019t accidentally gaze at his breeches again.</p><p>He let out a peal of laughter. \u201cLady Piddleton, Roberta! Coming into fifty years old, with a face like the back of a rusty saucepan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely wondered how it came to pass,\u201d she said with dignity.</p><p>\u201cJeweled heels,\u201d he said. \u201cBelying her age, she rubbed her shoe against my leg under the table at supper.\u201d</p><p>Roberta blinked at him. \u201cIn an invitation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so surprised? That\u2019s a notable insult!\u201d He made a mock scowl.</p><p>For a second, she saw him as Lady Piddleton undoubtedly did, a big muscled man who moved lazily but in perfect control, whose eyes had a wicked, laughing tilt to them.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are things you will have to learn quickly if you wish to marry Villiers\u2014you do wish for marriage, don\u2019t you? Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>She was quite sure that Villiers would do her quick honors in the sitting room as well. \u201cMarriage,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to trick him into it,\u201d Damon said.</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d She had been thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, and you\u2019re in a fair way to being the most delectable young lady on the market this year. But Villiers isn\u2019t on the market. He shows no sign of wanting a bride, not at all. And there\u2019s all those children of his to take into account.\u201d</p><p>Roberta nodded. \u201cFour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s only two,\u201d Damon said. \u201cBut one of them was fathered on an unmarried girl, daughter of Lord Killigrew. So it\u2019s not as if you could just let him spring you a babe, and hope that would get him to the altar.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cSeduction is out of the question, then,\u201d Damon said, and she felt him turn toward him. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know a thing about that business, do you? Have you ever kissed anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, yes,\u201d she said, enjoying the tiny shadow of surprise in his eyes. \u201cI may not have seen anyone tupping before, but I have certainly been kissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you kissed, as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, though frankly she wasn\u2019t sure what the difference was.</p><p>He put down his glass of brandy on the floor next to the couch. \u201cBeing kissed is like this,\u201d he said. His mouth came down on hers gently, persuasively.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be kissing me,\u201d Roberta said a second later. Her heart was thudding in her chest over the impropriety of it all. \u201cYou\u2019re my cousin\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he interjected.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know what I mean,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in love! I\u2019m really in love, Damon. You have to understand that. Ladies don\u2019t sit around and kiss other people when they\u2019re in love!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cI\u2019ve met so few people in love that I likely haven\u2019t learned that particular lesson yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true,\u201d Roberta said, feeling rather regretful because he looked disconsolate. \u201cI can\u2019t kiss you. I\u2019m supposed to be kissing Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he offer?\u201d</p><p>Roberta blinked at the intense green of his eyes. \u201cNot yet. We just met and danced but one time.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s coming to the house to play a chess match with Jemma and he said he would see me as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa,\u201d Damon said. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ve heard about the dual chess matches?\u201d</p><p>Roberta nodded.</p><p>\u201cTrust my sister to add yet another utterly disreputable story to a long and checkered career in my family.\u201d</p><p>Roberta thought it was very nice of Jemma to lure Villiers to the house, but she kept her mouth shut.</p><p>\u201cNow I kissed you,\u201d Damon said, \u201cso why don\u2019t you kiss me? Because you\u2019re going to have to understand kissing in order to catch Villiers. The man has slept with most of the women in London.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you saying I need to practice?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cSomething along those lines.

But there was nothing unpleasant about Damon, after all, and practice might be a good idea. So she leaned over to him and placed her lips on his, just as he had with her. And as Angus Pilfer had done, last year in the cow lane, and as the squire\u2019s son had done at the village dance the year before that.</p><p>\u201cIs that your best try?\u201d he asked, pulling back.</p> <p>She looked at him. There was something dangerous about this, but it was fun, not nearly as unnerving as talking to Villiers. \u201cI gather you think my performance was inadequate?\u201d she asked. \u201cThen, sir, I defer to your teaching abilities.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glinted at her. \u201cKisses are preludes. That couple we saw in the sitting room started with just a kiss, I\u2019ve no doubt.\u201d</p><p>The image flashed back into Roberta\u2019s mind and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cThey both enjoyed the kiss,\u201d he went on, \u201cand so things progressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Roberta said, not wanting to sit there silently like a little girl, \u201cI could certainly see they were enjoying the progression!\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cWho would have thought Lord Gordon had it in him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA horse-loving, stout Englishman. Did you see how his wig was askew?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAn intelligent gentleman always removes his wig for a true kiss.\u201d</p><p>She knew she was out of her depth; she knew it. He tossed his wig on a chair, and suddenly his hair swung forward, all bronzed brown and shining.</p> <p>\u201cSo, kiss me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She leaned toward him again. He smelled clean and fresh, not like some men she\u2019d danced with this evening who smelled like lilac hair powder or, worse, sweaty locks. She put her lips onto his and kept them there for a moment. Was she supposed to do any different?</p><p>But then somehow his mouth yielded to hers, though she had not asked such a thing, had not understood such a thing. The sweetness of it clanged through her body and she pulled back. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked, as if they hadn\u2019t\u2014as if she hadn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>But Roberta\u2019s mind was clashing with images. \u201cThat\u2019s what you meant by a prelude,\u201d she said, surprised to hear how very collected her own voice sounded.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d he said, sounding pleased, as if she were a good student who had solved a difficult mathematics problem.</p><p>He curled a large hand around the back of her neck. \u201cLet\u2019s do that again, shall we?\u201d he said. His head came toward hers. She closed her eyes this time, smelling the maleness of him and tasting him at the same time. He was holding her still, and suddenly he was doing the kissing, rather than she, and this was different.</p><p>No prelude, this, she thought dimly, because he was part of her, he was inside her, he was tasting her\u2014and how different it was. She had to stop kissing him. She was in love with someone else.</p><p>But somehow she leaned back against the sofa and he leaned toward her, and still he kissed her. His mouth was madness, like cherry wine in midsummer: sweet, intoxicating, drugging.</p> <p>He kept kissing her.</p><p>It made her feel restless, as if small sparks danced between her legs, as if the pooling warmth she felt in her stomach after leaving the sitting room were turning into something altogether more embarrassing and more\u2014more dangerous.</p><p>There was a dim question in her mind about the nature of kisses. And then, as if a curtain lifted, she realized that she was being kissed, and she rather thought she would like to kiss. So she curled her hands into the silky locks of his hair and pulled him a bit closer and kissed him.</p><p>It all changed again.</p><p>His body felt heavier against hers, hotter, charged with a weight that made her feel achy where she had felt warm.</p><p>As if he could hear that drugged thought whisper through her mind, he pulled back.</p><p>Roberta didn\u2019t open her eyes immediately.</p><p>\u201cHave I shocked you?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound in the least sorry, just curious.</p><p>She opened her eyes. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, meaning to shock him for once. \u201cI am interested in how kissing feels.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow flew up. \u201cFeels?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, and knew it was a siren\u2019s smile, a gamester\u2019s smile.</p><p>\u201cYou would appear to have learned something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf not from you, from the sitting room,\u201d she said. She stretched, knowing that the plumpness of her breasts above the stiff fabric of her bodice was tantalizingly close to his finger.</p><p>Being Damon, he did the unthinkable. He ran a long finger over the curve of her breast. \u201cVery nice,\u201d he said, and she heard the hitch in his voice with approval.</p><p>His finger burned a sweet trail. But she batted him away. \u201cA salutary lesson, and I thank you for it,\u201d she said, rising.</p><p>He rose too and she couldn\u2019t help checking his breeches. But alas, the heavy line of his coat swung into place.</p><p>He caught her looking and laughed. \u201cWell-designed coats, aren\u2019t they? Any number of women can caress my legs under the table and no one will know if I respond. I hardly need say that I did not respond for Lady Piddleton, but if you stroke me under the table, it would be another story.\u201d</p><p>Roberta walked over to a mirror on the wall rather than answer this nonsense. The glass was long enough to give her an excellent view of the way her silk gown had been crushed when he leaned against her. There was nothing to be done about that, but she tucked an errant curl back into place.</p><p>Damon appeared in the mirror behind her, bewigged once more. He was so warm that she could feel his body just behind her. \u201c\u2019Twas a dangerous game we played tonight,\u201d he said to her reflection. \u201cI am no Villiers, Roberta. If we ended up with a child, you\u2019d have to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were a long way from that!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot so very far. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>She concentrated on repositioning a spray of apple blossoms that was hanging drunkenly over her ear. That ache low in her belly told her that he was right. He leaned close to her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou know how we watched that couple?\u201d he said to her.</p><p>She nodded and repressed a shiver.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible to watch oneself make love in a glass,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rosy color flooded her cheeks. \u201cI declare that you have made it your pleasure to shock me this evening!\u201d she said, taking as sophisticated a tone as she could muster.</p><p>He met her eyes and her next sentence died on her lips. Still watching her, he bent his head and kissed her neck.</p><p>She shivered in his hands, as if she were a newborn bird fallen from its nest.</p><p>Then he held out his arm, and they left the room.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>I t wasn\u2019t until nearly morning that Roberta was able to pull Jemma into the ladies\u2019 retiring room. \u201cPlaying a simpering fool definitely won\u2019t win Villiers,\u201d she told her.</p><p>\u201cWe know that. But you did a magnificent job of it tonight,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cEveryone has told me how sweet you are. And most of them added the pious wish that I not corrupt you.\u201d</p><p>Roberta smiled at that. \u201cSince seduction will be ineffective, I\u2019m going to have to trick him into marriage.\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked thoughtful. \u201cYou think so?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. He\u2019s all of what\u2014how old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so very old,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cHe and Beaumont were boyhood friends, as I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now they don\u2019t speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRarely. They did exchange a few words tonight. I suspect they have little in common by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, how old is your husband?\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked blank. \u201cThirty-three,\u201d she finally decided. \u201cIt must be in our marriage lines, I suppose. We were engaged when I was the tender age of two, and I think he was seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Villiers is likely thirty-three as well.\u201d A very nicely preserved thirty-three, Roberta thought to herself. She felt a pulse of longing. \u201cI\u2019ll have to attend any ball where he might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can always bribe one of his footmen, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pleasant thought, but I might end up with a child and no marriage,\u201d she said dubiously.</p> <p>\u201cDid you think I was suggesting we bribe the footman to give you entry to his chamber?\u201d</p><p>And at Roberta\u2019s nod, \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to corrupt me,\u201d Jemma said, laughing. \u201cYou aren\u2019t much of an innocent, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d Roberta said, with a helpless shrug.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bribe a footman to let us know which invitations he accepts,\u201d Jemma explained. \u201cThe more important question is how to trick him. You can\u2019t simply\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Roberta interrupted. \u201cHe spurned a lady carrying his child so that would be ineffective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough Damon would likely challenge him for you,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI probably do not need to mention this to you, Roberta, but you have noticed how my brother is looking at you, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has been all that\u2019s kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d his sister said. \u201cBut...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, we had a discussion about Villiers,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cHe fully shares my opinion that Villiers must be tricked. And it was he who warned me about Villiers\u2019s refusal to marry the lady carrying his baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, in that case...I must be mistaken,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Damon as well as I used to. He visited me often in Paris, far more than my husband, but still, one\u2019s siblings grow up and change, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Having never had a sibling, Roberta didn\u2019t venture to comment.</p><p>\u201cAs I said, the important question is how to trick Villiers in such a way that he cannot back out. He cares nothing for scandal. In truth, I think the only way for him to marry would be if you simply married him, if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Roberta asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we know he\u2019s not going to marry under his own aegis. And yet he\u2019s famous for breaking every sort of law of decency and morality in order to get his own way with a woman. Did Damon tell you what Lady Caroline said after it all came out about the child?\u201d</p><p>Roberta shook her head.</p><p>\u201cShe maintained that Villiers had married her in secret, a sort of Fleet Street marriage. But it seems that the marriage certificate was false, because her father would have forced him to acknowledge the marriage if it were all true.\u201d</p><p>It was rather depressing to think of her future husband\u2019s unethical behavior. \u201cIf the wedding certificate were false, wouldn\u2019t her father have done something about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could he do, other than challenge Villiers to a duel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have done that! My father would have\u2014\u201d The mind boggled thinking what Roberta\u2019s father would have done. It would have been violent and noisy.</p><p>\u201cWomen are invariably more decisive than are men,\u201d Jemma said, yawning. \u201cI think we should sleep on the possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how he got away with it,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t give a damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect he got away with it because he really doesn\u2019t give a damn what society thinks. The only thing he cares about is chess, and Roberta, you really ought to think about that. I\u2019m not as obsessed as Villiers, and yet when we first married Beaumont loathed the fact that I thought about chess far more than I thought about him. Or listened to him. Villiers will be just the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I were Lady Caroline\u2019s father...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could he do? Villiers is an excellent swordsman. Almost all chess players are. If there\u2019s one thing a chess player can do, it\u2019s master a game of strategy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you are my secret weapon,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>Jemma blinked.</p><p>\u201cI suspect that you are a better chess player than Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard that women can\u2019t play chess?\u201d Jemma opened her eyes very wide.</p><p>\u201cYour brother told me you are a master. With a strategist pitted against him, Villiers cannot win.\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked marginally more awake. \u201cThere\u2019s a play we call the poisoned pawn. We could allow Villiers to lure you into a false wedding, during which you would produce a real certificate, and then he\u2019d be caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could we ensure that he would offer to marry me with a false certificate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we can\u2019t...but men are invariably repetitive. If he offers a secret marriage, we\u2019ll know what he\u2019s planning. It worked with one young lady, so why not with another? I don\u2019t mean to be pessimistic, Roberta, but are you sure you wish to marry such a man? I find my husband tedious, but not dishonorable.\u201d</p><p>Roberta nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s my heart\u2019s desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s plan on a wedding certificate exchange. We\u2019ll have to wait for his move. In a game of strategy, it\u2019s best to allow the early game to develop on its own rather than taking an opening gambit.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>F inally the ball had dwindled to the point at which Jemma decided that they could go to bed and leave the few remaining revelers to greet the dawn alone.</p><p>Roberta started off for her chambers dreaming of being a duchess. Villiers\u2019s duchess. His behavior didn\u2019t bother her much. How could it, since she\u2019d grown up in a household dominated by her father, whose madness, as she knew well, was not exaggerated by report? Chicanery of Villiers\u2019s type seemed positively wholesome by contrast.</p><p>It took a while to get ready for bed, as her maid didn\u2019t immediately understand that she couldn\u2019t go to sleep with powder in her hair. Perhaps she should just wear a wig the way Damon did.</p><p>So it wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d had a bath, said goodnight to her maid and drew back the heavy rose curtains around her bed that she had a shock.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>There was a male body in her bed.</p><p>He was very small and sweaty. He was curled like a little wood-louse, the kind you find when you turn over earth in the springtime. His hair was the exact color of his father\u2019s, a kind of brandy-brown, but all in ringlets. And he was snoring.</p><p>Roberta sat on the edge of the bed and stared at Teddy for a moment. She didn\u2019t have much of a propensity for children; indeed, she had several times thought that her instinct toward maternal love seemed strangely muted. She never felt like doing more than coo over the estate children when they were presented for kisses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t even feel like cooing over this one.</p><p>She was bitterly tired, and there was a sweaty, snoring man, albeit a small one, in her bed.</p><p>With a sigh she reached out and pulled the cord by the bed. A housemaid appeared and clucked. \u201cThey\u2019ve been looking for that child all over the house,\u201d she said. \u201cHis lordship is that worried!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, tell him to come fetch it,\u201d Roberta said, unable to make her tone more enthusiastic.</p> <p>A minute later Damon himself appeared. His face had lost all its easy charm of earlier; he barely looked at her, Roberta noted with a pulse of irritation. Instead, he half-lunged at the bed and then stared down at his son.</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said. It sounded half a curse, half a prayer.</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t have thought he\u2019d left the house,\u201d she said, letting irritation drip into her tone.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know where he was. I couldn\u2019t find him,\u201d Damon said, not turning to look at her. \u201cChrist, what a couple of hours it\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you possibly take him with you now?\u201d She was feeling more and more irritable. Damon had kissed her earlier, and now he acted with as much interest as if she were a housemaid he had bussed in a side corridor.</p> <p>He was already folding back the covers, but he stopped, and looked at her for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Roberta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He scooped up the sleeping child and she saw exactly what he meant. Where the boy had nestled\u2014in her bed\u2014there was a dank looking spot. A very large, wet spot. And the smell that arose from it was everything one might expect.</p><p>Her maid let out a little shriek.</p><p>Damon smiled at her ruefully and Roberta registered exactly how adorable he was, at the same time she felt a swell of irritation that almost had her screaming along with the maid.</p><p>\u201cI do apologize. It only happens when he\u2019s in a very deep sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a compliment to my bedding?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou are right to be annoyed. I\u2019ll return immediately.\u201d And he made a leg while holding the sleeping child, which Roberta had to admit was quite a trick. Particularly since the rose colored sleeve of his brocade coat was, quite likely, getting ruined.</p><p>The only good thing about it, Roberta thought as the housekeeper and a flock of maids burst into the room, was that it confirmed that vague sense she had that children were undesirable.</p><p>The headache pounding behind her right ear said the same.</p><p>Two minutes later, Damon reentered the room and pulled her unceremoniously to her feet. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI gather you didn\u2019t hear that it will take some time to air and make up another room,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>\u201cSo Mrs. Friss, the housekeeper, told me. We came up with a solution.\u201d</p><p>Down the hall they went, until they turned into a room. It was beautifully made up, linen sheets turned back and looking so inviting that Roberta almost fell into them directly.</p> <p>\u201cThank you!\u201d she said, and only then did she realize that a rather rotund individual was hastily sweeping away an assortment of masculine looking accoutrements. \u201cOh, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Damon said. \u201cThat will be all, Martins. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>Martins took himself and a collection of neck clothes out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t take your room,\u201d Roberta said. But she felt as if she were swaying in place.</p><p>\u201cOf course you could. These mattresses are all old, you know. Wool, most likely. Yours is going to soak up Teddy\u2019s urine like a flower in the sun. You don\u2019t want to sleep in that bed until the mattress is replaced.\u201d</p><p>Roberta shuddered.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a ghost but more sickly looking.\u201d Then, before she quite knew what was happening, he undid the knot at her waist, pulled off her dressing gown, ignoring her protests, and bundled her under the covers.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a larger version of your son,\u201d she said, peeping at him from under the covers.</p><p>He sat down on the bed\u2014which was vastly improper\u2014and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t resemble Teddy in the slightest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that is something to be grateful for. Why was he in my chambers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine he was on his usual search for my room and thought he\u2019d found it. Jemma\u2019s mother-in-law didn\u2019t waste any inspiration decorating the bedrooms; they\u2019re all precisely the same.\u201d</p><p>Roberta cast a bleary look at the walls, and sure enough the crest of the Beaumonts marched around the top of the walls, and a painting that looked remarkably like Judith holding a platter was directly opposite the bed. She shut her eyes.</p><p>He kissed her so swiftly that it might have been a dream.</p><p>Perhaps it was.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>April 12</p><p>Day one of the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>Beaumont House</p><p>E arly the next afternoon, Beaumont House was brimming like a stagnant pool full of brine shrimp wearing heels and velvet jackets. The only problem was that the residents weren\u2019t in a position to receive them.</p><p>The duke had left the house early in the morning, bound for a meeting with Pitt and then the House of Lords. Teddy woke up at seven in the morning. Damon rose just long enough to push his son in the direction of a maid, and then collapsed back into bed. Teddy migrated to the kitchens, and from thence to the little shed where the gardener kept his spades and the cat kept her kittens. Roberta woke briefly at nine, groaned, and went back to sleep. Jemma was one of those people who only needed five hours of sleep, but never left her room before three in the afternoon on principal. Philidor had given her a book by an Italian chess player named Greco as a goodbye. She was working through the combinations and finding them surprisingly unambitious.</p><p>In consequence, flowers were dropped in the duchess\u2019s sitting room until it resembled nothing so much as a royal funeral. Carriages drew up and left with the regularity of traffic to a new apothecary promising miraculous increases to one\u2019s bosom.</p><p>Finally, the duchess decided that she would receive. \u201cTwo of them may come up,\u201d Jemma said to Brigitte.</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers didn\u2019t wait but left a card,\u201d Brigitte said.</p><p>Jemma picked up the beautifully embossed card, as elegant as the man who owned it. His hand was nothing like Elijah\u2019s impossible scrawl. At the time you choose, it said.</p><p>Very nice. There was a certain lack of eagerness there that was entirely appealing in a gentleman with whom one might be embarking on an affaire\u2014she caught herself hastily. Of course, she was merely dallying with the idea. Had she not promised her husband that her salad days were behind her? More to the point\u2014since Elijah had made no promises about his mistress\u2014she had decided to deliver Villiers into the virtuous, if thorny, bonds of matrimony. She sighed and handed the card back to Brigitte. \u201cSix of the clock. Inform him that he may stay to sup afterward. And do send a note to Lady Roberta informing her the same.\u201d</p><p>Of course, the servants would gossip, but servants always knew everything so Jemma saw no reason to prevaricate.</p><p>\u201cOh, and Brigitte,\u201d she said.</p><p>Brigitte turned as she was about to leave the room. She was as exquisite a little Frenchwoman as existed on British shores and sometimes, Jemma thought, dressed with more \u00e9clat than did her mistress. \u201cYou know the \u00e9charpe cloak that you so admire?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brigitte clasped her hands together. \u201cThe blue one, Your Grace, with the black lace?\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled at her. \u201cIt is yours in return for a small act of espionage, which I am convinced you will enjoy.\u201d</p><p>She trembled with excitement. \u201cEnchant\u00e9e!\u201d Brigitte said, eyes aglow.</p><p>\u201cVilliers comes to play a game of chess with me. He will be accompanied by footmen, naturally.\u201d</p> <p>Brigitte nodded.</p><p>\u201cI should dearly love to know every detail of une petite affaire he had with a certain Lady Caroline Killigrew, who found herself with child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuelle folie,\u201d Brigitte said, indicating with a Frenchwoman\u2019s briskness just what she thought of Lady Caroline\u2019s foolishness in not controlling her reproductive options.</p><p>\u201cThere has been a certain amount of gossip suggesting that Villiers went through a false wedding ceremony with the young lady.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte\u2019s loyalty switched sides instantly. \u201cChien!\u201d she spat.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps...perhaps not. There are so many sides to a tale, are there not? We need to know everything of Lady Caroline.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte dimpled. \u201cI will do my best.\u201d</p><p>Before a Frenchwoman\u2019s best, an English footman is but a house of straw. \u201cI shall accept two gentlemen to help me dress, Brigitte. Corbin, of course, and perhaps...oh, Viscount St. Albans. He was wearing a truly magnificent costume last night and ought to be rewarded.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte curtsied and flew down the stairs to find St. Albans and Lord Corbin, who were ushered up the stairs and into the duchess\u2019s bedchamber, where they found Jemma attired in a chemise and corset, ready for the gentlemen\u2019s skill in helping her answer delicate points to do with patches, powder, ribbons and finally her gown.</p><p>Roberta awoke to find herself in a room that looked like a copy of her original, except for the faint imprint of Damon\u2019s personality. There was a cravat flung over a chair. A book sat on the dressing table; Roberta wandered over, saw the name John Donne and dropped the poems with a thud. His clothes were in the wardrobe, of course.</p><p>He had a magnificent costume of cherry velvet lined in cream sarsenet. Taking the coat to the window, she could see metal sequins, sewn into elaborate patterns with silver embroidery. Even looking at it made her heart twist with longing. And desire. She had to marry Villiers soon, so that she could buy a gown in precisely this cherry color with sequins.</p> <p>There was a scratch at the door and Roberta hastily dropped the coat onto the bed. But as the door opened, she didn\u2019t see her maid. In fact, she didn\u2019t see anyone until the door closed again and Teddy appeared around the end of her bed.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d she said by way of greeting.</p><p>\u201cGotta apologize, my papa says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy papa says\u2014appropriately\u2014that I should apologize,\u201d Roberta corrected him.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cBrought you\u2014I brought you a present.\u201d</p><p>Roberta summoned up a smile. Of course she ought to be touched by whatever grubby, bent flower he was about to produce from under his coat.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a flower, but a struggling, spitting kitten. She felt no inclination to take it from him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d better put it down,\u201d she said after the charming feline gave Teddy another red welt across his hand.</p> <p>He dropped it and the kitten landed on its splayed-out feet with a rather pitiful mew of protest and then streaked under the bed.</p><p>\u201cIt was much nicer when it was in the shed,\u201d Teddy said, with an edge of apology in his voice. \u201cI thought you might like it. Since you have to sleep alone. Cats are good company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like sleeping alone,\u201d Roberta informed him.</p><p>He wandered over. \u201cThat\u2019s Papa\u2019s French coat,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance is in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis is in France,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to retrieve that kitten and take it back to its mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours now. Besides, I wanted to tell you about the gardener, he works in the gardens and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gardener works in the gardens,\u201d Roberta said automatically, moving over to pull the cord.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Rummer and he used to be a prize-fighter. Rummer used to stroddle his opponents and once he almost spent five guineas for a wife\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a wife?\u201d Roberta said, rather startled by that. She had seated herself before the dressing table and began brushing out her hair.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed. Rummer was at a fair in Smithfield and a man was auctioning his wife, and he wanted five guineas to start, and Rummer thought about it hard, but then he decided that the life of a prize-fighter was no place for a wife because\u201d\u2014Teddy finished triumphantly\u2014\u201clady\u2019s gowns are pinned so high these days that you can\u2019t see their heads for their tails.\u201d And he broke into a mad fit of giggling, and repeated the head and tail part two or three times for the pure naughty value of it.</p><p>Roberta just kept brushing. It was rather sad to think about the wife auctioned off for five guineas, but when questioned, Teddy didn\u2019t know her fate, only that Rummer hadn\u2019t bought her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two things you need to discover,\u201d Roberta told him. \u201cWhat happened to the wife, and what a bog-trotting croggie is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI likes you!\u201d he said, beaming up at her. \u201cI likes you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>\u201cI like you because you listen to me. Papa says that I\u2019m a gossip who could out-rattle fifty porters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with him.\u201d Finally there was a knock at the door and she called, \u201cEnter. I didn\u2019t know it was you,\u201d she said rather crossly.</p><p>\u201cPapa, look at this,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cThe lady\u2019s new kitten likes your red coat.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the kitten had clawed its way up on the bed and was nestled in velvet with silver embroidery.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dressed,\u201d Roberta said with dignity. \u201cI\u2019ll thank you to take your son out of this room\u2014once again\u2014and allow me to continue dressing.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cAt this very moment my sister is undoubtedly entertaining at least two gentlemen in her chambers as they aid her in choosing the day\u2019s costume. Why don\u2019t Teddy and I do the honors?\u201d</p><p>Roberta realized she still had her brush in the air and put it down in exasperation. Teddy had picked up the kitten, who actually seemed to be purring.</p><p>\u201cI very much doubt that your sister is allowing gentlemen into her bedchamber while she\u2019s\u201d\u2014Roberta glanced down to make sure that her dressing gown was still tied tightly\u2014\u201cen d\u00e9shabill\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s precisely the fashion these days,\u201d he said, taking a chair and swinging it about so that he could sit on it facing her. \u201cIt would be a dismal thing indeed for a lady to dress herself. Generally one has a maid or two in the room as well. They throw the clothes on you, while Teddy and I advise you where to place a patch, if you wish one, and face color, and ribbons\u2014that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not believe that unmarried ladies invite gentlemen into their rooms while they dress. And I don\u2019t wish to wear a patch!\u201d Roberta said, feeling rather discomposed. She prided herself on her lack of na\u00efvet\u00e9, but she was beginning to realize that being sophisticated in comparison to Mrs. Grope was nothing in relation to the Reeve family. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damon\u2019s eyes were even greener in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go onto the river,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cThis kitten would like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it,\u201d his father said. \u201cRoberta likely has important things to do.\u201d</p><p>The river? In truth, Roberta had a singular longing to see more of London. \u201cI have to return to the house by early evening,\u201d she said cautiously.</p> <p>\u201cAh, the great Villiers chess match,\u201d Damon said, rising. \u201cCome on, scrap. Let\u2019s give Roberta some time to put on a gown without our help, and then we can all go on the river. Haven\u2019t you ever been out on a river?\u201d</p><p>Roberta shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOn a picnic?\u201d</p><p>Roberta did not feel like explaining her disinclination to picnic with Mrs. Grope, so she just shook her head again.</p><p>\u201cA woman with much to learn,\u201d Damon said, with a wicked smile that spoke of kisses, not picnics. Then he was gone, leaving behind a red velvet coat with small white hairs sprinkled across the front.</p> <p>Roberta untied her dressing gown. Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be going on the river, whatever that signified. Perhaps she should stay at home so that she was definitely here when Villiers arrived.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t quite certain what she meant to do to or with Villiers in order to make him marry her, although the very thought of him made her heart speed up again. Her maid burst into the room, carrying another of Jemma\u2019s gowns. It was a pale blossom pink, and Roberta forgot all about Villiers as she learned the intricacies of a skirt draped \u00e0 la polonaise.</p><p>Some two hours later, Viscount St. Albans bowed his way out of Jemma\u2019s room and minced his way down the stairs. He was a slender man who made the very best of himself. This afternoon he was wearing a magnificent suit of lemon-colored iridescent silk, set with enameled buttons. His coat curved away from his waist; he left it entirely open, displaying all twenty buttons on his waistcoat (matching enamel, naturally). The waistcoat was judiciously padded over the chest, which repaired the one small fault he found with his own physique. Well, that and perhaps the fact that his eyes were just a trifle too close together.</p><p>He picked his way down the stairs carefully because there is nothing worse than polished marble when one was wearing high heels, and he judged that height was always desirable. But his mind was racing far ahead of him, already at the coffee house reporting the pleasurable fact that when he announced a previous engagement that meant he must take himself off, though naturally he perfumed the fact with many compliments, Corbin had made no move to leave the duchess\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>In fact, he had left the two of them in a cozy discussion of some chess player from Poland, a god-forsaken country that did not interest the viscount in the least. He wrinkled his nose at the thought of how they tried to fool him into thinking they were actually talking of chess. Clearly, Corbin and the duchess had bored him to tears in an effort to make him leave, which, frankly, he was more than happy to do.</p><p>Far be it from him to separate two love birds. Although he would do his best to ascertain just how long Corbin and the duchess would stay in unchaperoned harmony.</p> <p>He reached the entryway and demanded a mirror. As a footman held the glass for him, he carefully placed his Macaroni hat on top of his curls at a jaunty angle. Then he noticed that a rosette was falling from his shoe; ten minutes later he was seated in an elegant little chair while the duke\u2019s own valet sewed the rosette into a better position. After that, of course, he must needs readjust his stockings in private, and finally, he ended up in front of the glass again, rearranging his hat.</p><p>Just when he was about to give up altogether, he heard a brisk clicking of heels and down came Corbin.</p><p>\u201cStill here?\u201d Corbin said, with a cheerful grin that\u2014to the viscount\u2019s mind\u2014signaled far too much cheer for a mere discussion of chess.</p><p>\u201cI suffered the greatest imposition to my shoe,\u201d the viscount said, taking care to lisp slightly in the new fashion. \u201cIt is of all things annoying; these rosettes are prone to falling on the wayside, do you not think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never wear such things,\u201d Corbin remarked.</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d the viscount said, larding his voice with disapproval. \u201cYour waistcoat would look so much better with a small fringe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours would be greatly improved without it,\u201d Corbin said, with such a gentle smile that at first the viscount didn\u2019t take his meaning, and by the time he did\u2014and would have rejoined sharply with a sharp comment about those buttons!\u2014Corbin had slapped on a round hat and taken himself out of the house.</p><p>The viscount huffed and minced his way down the stairs to his waiting carriage. In his mind, there was no question. While the duchess did not seem to be carrying a child, she was clearly carrying a lover. He tittered to himself at his own jest.</p> <p>In their wake, a perfumed, powdered and altogether delectable duchess wandered downstairs, leaving her bedchamber, strewn with silks and ribbands, flowers and shoes, to be made presentable for her upcoming chess match with Villiers.</p><p>To her surprise, her husband was just coming in the front door.</p><p>She halted halfway down the stairs, hand on her heart. \u201cGood lord, Beaumont,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat an odd start to see you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finished the day\u2019s business,\u201d he said, looking up at her.</p><p>Jemma tripped down the last few steps, conscious of being glad that she looked her very best. Which was a sad reflection on the tedium of her life, if she considered such a thing in connection to her husband.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to begin our game?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou play Villiers in your chambers,\u201d he said. \u201cI would suppose that mine must do the honors for our game. If you\u2019ll give me a moment, I\u2019ll remove my wig.\u201d And then, when she didn\u2019t move, \u201cYou do know the location of my chambers, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Jemma didn\u2019t glance at the footmen who lined the wall, their faces blank and their ears straining for every word. \u201cI shall endeavor to find my way there.\u201d</p><p>Elijah watched her go back up the stairs. She was wearing a gown light enough to flutter in the breeze. It was indisputably French, designed to make a man break into an instant sweat.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think of Jemma\u2019s sensual appeal if he meant to win this game. The one thing about his wife that he had never underestimated was her intelligence. In truth, his memories of their early beddings were not that interesting. It was so long ago that he could hardly remember, and everything took place under the covers, and that rarely.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t her fault, exactly, that she was a tedious bedpartner. Obviously, he\u2019d been a poor teacher. But it had meant that his mistress Sarah\u2019s bouncing, erotic pleasure in his company provided a sharp contrast to the wife his father picked out for him when he was a lad of seven.</p><p>He started up the stairs. Would it have turned out differently had Jemma not found him in his chambers in Westminster with Sarah?</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>And perhaps not.</p><p>Neither of them appeared designed for the narrow straits of matrimony.</p><p>She entered his room a few minutes later, as he was setting out the pieces. \u201cAh, your grandfather\u2019s chessboard,\u201d she said. \u201cI hadn\u2019t remembered it until now, but of course I played many a game on it during our first year of marriage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho did you play with back then?\u201d he asked. He had been so feverishly excited by his burgeoning role in the House that he barely remembered being at home. Not that things were much better now. All day long people had elbowed him, and smirked at him, and asked him what he was still doing in Westminster. Until finally they drove him to come home some four hours earlier than was his usual practice.</p><p>\u201cThe second footman was a fairly good partner: remember Jacobs? He had a long face, like a bulldog. I was saddened to hear that he had died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died?\u201d</p><p>Jemma nodded. \u201cHow gorgeous this chess set is.\u201d Each piece was a delicate marble fantasy of medieval warfare. The paint had long ago worn off, except for faint touches of red, in the fury of the king\u2019s eyes, on the queen\u2019s lower lip, in the bishop\u2019s robe.</p> <p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t remember your game,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cI do. I am ready for attack, if you please.\u201d He moved a pawn to King\u2019s Four.</p><p>Jemma smiled and moved her pawn to King\u2019s Three.</p><p>\u201cThe pawn is my favorite piece,\u201d Elijah remarked.</p><p>Jemma sat back, their moves ended for the day. \u201cI could have guessed that. So lowly and humble as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pawn is crafty, versatile, and in pairs, they sometimes prove irresistible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s little flair in a pawn,\u201d Jemma said, picking up her queen to examine her faded robes.</p><p>\u201cYour game is all about flair, as I recall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds remarkably dismissive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to think of my strength as being in the area of assault.\u201d</p><p>Elijah watched his wife\u2019s delicate fingers. \u201cWhat I remember of your game,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cwas that you would attack, but in the event of opposition, you would sacrifice. Run. You sometimes lost on that account.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma replaced her queen with a little click. \u201cHow gratifying to know that you remember the intricacies of my failures.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Around three in the afternoon</p><p>The Fleet River</p><p>\u201cI told you that the kitten wanted to come,\u201d Teddy said.</p><p>\u201cBut I disagreed,\u201d his father said. \u201cAnd I thought my sentiments constituted a mandate.\u201d</p><p>Roberta watched footmen pack a sturdy basket into a flat-bottomed boat. It was a very pretty boat, with a roof of flowered muslin that rippled in the breeze, little benches for seats and rolled canvas walls that could be lowered from the roof in case of a sudden shower.</p><p>\u201cThis is Mr. Cunningham,\u201d Damon said, introducing a serious looking young man who apparently arranged for the boat. \u201cRansom, this is Lady Roberta St. Giles. Ransom is my brother-in-law\u2019s secretary. We know each other from years of debauchery at Cambridge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHardly debauchery,\u201d Mr. Cunningham protested.</p><p>Damon ignored that. \u201cMore to the point, Ransom knows every bend of the river, and he has been kind enough to eschew the duke\u2019s company for ours today.\u201d</p><p>Roberta smiled at Mr. Cunningham, and thought that he had lovely dark eyes, and that it was a nice thing to go onto the river with two handsome young men.</p><p>Well, one could say three. Or two and a half.</p><p>The kitten was the only interloper.</p><p>Roberta could see precisely why Teddy was sleeping hither and yon, in beds where he had no call to be. Damon was attempting to be charming to his son, which, while a nice impulse, was the wrong tactic. Of course Teddy ignored talk of sentiments and mandates.</p><p>The fact that Teddy was reasonably entertaining company did not excuse the fact that he was a child, therefore, by definition, a lower species.</p><p>She cut directly into Damon\u2019s courteous discussion of the kitten\u2019s likely distaste for boating. \u201cPerhaps we should see if he likes to swim.\u201d</p><p>Teddy clutched the animal to his breast, his eyes rounding as he reassessed her as a homicidal cat hater.</p><p>\u201cJust to see if he likes it. Your father can fish him out if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Teddy shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s not a swimming cat,\u201d Roberta said, pausing a little to make clear her opinion of small kittens who professed no skills at swimming, \u201cthen he\u2019ll stay in the carriage until he learns to know better.\u201d And without further ado, she plucked the cat from Teddy\u2019s arms and handed it to a footman.</p><p>\u201cAre we going swimming?\u201d Teddy asked, trotting along next to her as she walked down the stone steps to the waiting boat.</p><p>\u201cI certainly hope not,\u201d Damon said, handing her into the boat.</p><p>Roberta settled herself under the awning and they set out. The Fleet River was much smaller than the Thames, no more than a sleek and sinuous little stream, gleaming and sparkling in the sunlight. Mr. Cunningham moved them along by stabbing a large pole in the water and drawing it back out. Every movement caused the water to chatter and boil around the pole, which enchanted Teddy.</p><p>Damon kept himself occupied by ineffectively remonstrating his son for crimes such as getting wet, and Roberta trailed a hand in the water and watched the ripple of the water. Presently a family of ducks joined them.</p><p>\u201cIf only we had your kitten now,\u201d Roberta said to Teddy, \u201cwe could throw him in and he could catch us a nice fat duck for supper.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head at her. \u201cMy kitten, he\u2019s too small.\u201d</p><p>Roberta corrected his grammar, and Teddy allowed as how the kitten would have liked a ride on a duck\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m going to catch a fish for his supper!\u201d</p><p>Damon grabbed him back into the boat just in time.</p><p>The backs of large pleasure gardens stretched to the river; it was as if they were in Bath, or another more slumberous place than the great city of London. Just where green turf came to the water\u2019s edge, one could see brown tree roots jumbled at the surface of the water. There was a squeal when Teddy discovered that sleek silver bodies flashed among the roots.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to catch a minnow out here if you want one,\u201d Damon said.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cunningham,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cdo people boat on the Thames as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s too much river traffic,\u201d Mr. Cunningham explained. \u201cThe Thames is no place for anything other than a large pleasure craft. Unfortunately, they\u2019re talking of covering over the Fleet, which would be a great shame.\u201d</p><p>They drifted past a field all glossy and yellow with buttercups just as Teddy managed to catch a large amount of dripping weed. \u201cLook!\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll give this to my kitten because Rummer says that cats eat grass sometimes, did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Damon said fiercely, \u201cDrop it, Teddy.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Cunningham was laughing. \u201cYou need to teach your son how to swim, Damon. He\u2019ll swim like a minnow on the first try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that I would,\u201d Teddy put in.</p><p>\u201cThe water\u2019s quite shallow around the curve over there,\u201d Mr. Cunningham suggested. \u201cMud flats. We could simply drop him off the boat, just as Lady Roberta suggested for the kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be good,\u201d Teddy said, nodding so vigorously that he didn\u2019t notice his father pulling the seaweed away, although he promptly plunged his hand back in the water to try to rescue it.</p><p>\u201cTeddy, I told you not to get wet,\u201d his father said. \u201cAnd Ransom, do I understand you to be volunteering for the pleasure of such instruction?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rather to Roberta\u2019s surprise, Mr. Cunningham didn\u2019t say no outright. \u201cSwimming involves disrobing, which wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for ladies,\u201d he noted.</p><p>\u201cA boy never shows a girl his pizzle,\u201d Teddy informed Roberta.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut once you\u2019re married, you can look at all of \u2019em that you wish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI assume that is a philosophy learned at Papa\u2019s knee?\u201d Roberta enquired.</p><p>Damon stopped laughing to say that perhaps the field would be a good place for their picnic.</p><p>Mr. Cunningham agreeably began steering the boat in that direction and a moment later they were on the bank. Teddy let it be known that he would like a private visit to the trees, and he and Damon set off in that direction. Roberta busied herself with setting out the picnic basket under a tree while Mr. Cunningham fashioned a landing post out of a sapling.</p><p>By the time they came back, Roberta had discovered that a rug on top of bumpy ground is not a comfortable seat. They all seated themselves except Teddy, who danced around them like an impatient dragonfly.</p><p>Damon drained his glass of wine with a slightly desperate air. \u201cParenting is exhausting,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat is because you have insufficient help. Weren\u2019t you going to find a nursemaid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Registry Office is sending a new one tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI only have to survive today.\u201d</p><p>Roberta looked at him and couldn\u2019t help a tiny smile. His hair was standing on end, and his arm was wet to the elbow from pulling Teddy\u2019s hand out of the river. He was pouring himself another glass of wine as if it were the elixir of life. Mr. Cunningham had deserted his uncomfortable seat and was swinging Teddy in a circle until he shrieked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Mr. Cunningham would be kind enough to go through the grove to the mud flat?\u201d Roberta asked. \u201cHe can teach Teddy how to swim and we\u2019ll sit in this vastly uncomfortable spot and wait for them to come back, sparing me the sight of a miniature pizzle.\u201d</p><p>Damon blinked at her for a moment and then leapt to his feet. \u201cRansom!\u201d he called.</p><p>Roberta finished her glass just as Mr. Cunningham and Teddy set off through the grove.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t drown, will he?\u201d Damon said, sounding not terribly concerned.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s unlikely. Where did Mr. Cunningham learn about children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely he has siblings,\u201d Damon said. He lay backwards and then sat up with a curse. \u201cDamn it, where have you placed us, Roberta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a field of buttercups. Tables and chairs are unaccountably missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in many a field,\u201d Damon said, \u201cand this is the most uncomfortable of my experience.\u201d He brought Roberta to her feet. Then he picked up the rug and kicked at something underneath.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCowpats,\u201d he said. \u201cYou put the rug down on a lovely collection of them. In fact,\u201d Damon said looking about, \u201cthis entire field is dotted with cowpats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose a bull will be coming along?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn a month or so when the grass is high enough. I\u2019m going to have to sacrifice my gloves, which will give Martins palpitations, but what can I do? Back up, Roberta.\u201d</p><p>Two minutes later, cowpats started sailing across the field.</p><p>\u201cSee if you can get one in the river,\u201d Roberta suggested.</p><p>The river lay gurgling in the sunshine, about ten yards away. Damon pulled back his arm and then let the cowpat fly.</p><p>It struck the bank just before the river. Roberta very loudly said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI can do better than that,\u201d Damon muttered. \u201cHere, help me take my coat off. I don\u2019t want to soil it with my gloves.\u201d</p><p>She helped him pull off his beautiful coat. It was a misty grey, lined with scarlet silk that trimmed the sleeves with a huge open cuff. His breeches were the same scarlet, very tight. His waistcoat followed until he was wearing nothing but the breeches and a linen shirt, so fine that she could see the swell of his muscles as he threw another cowpat. But it landed a good foot before the edge.</p><p>\u201cDo gentlemen invite women into their chambers to help them dress, the way ladies do?\u201d she asked with some curiosity.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m aiming at that duck, Roberta\u2014\u201d And he gave a little whoop. \u201cHit it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, if it hadn\u2019t dived first.\u201d And then, answering his gesture, \u201cNo, I am certainly not going to hand you a cowpat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never ask such a thing of a proper lady, but that\u2019s the great thing about you, Roberta. You\u2019re not so ladylike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you have no idea how tedious ladies can be. For one thing, they have no sense of competitiveness. And having grown up as Jemma\u2019s brother, you can imagine how boring I find that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jemma competitive?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cJemma is the best female chess player in England and France, and quite likely better than all the men as well. She kept beating Philidor, and he is the best in France.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the best in England?\u201d</p><p>He blinked at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYour lover,\u201d he said with relish. \u201cVilliers. Though I suppose I shouldn\u2019t yet call him that. Now, do you suppose I could hit the sapling we tied the boat to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very encouraging,\u201d he complained and then leaned back as far as he could and let go with a mighty fling. The pat fell far short.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d she said.</p><p>It was very gratifying; his mouth actually fell open.</p><p>Clearly, the right shape of cowpat was essential. It had to be disc shaped, as opposed to some of the balls Damon was hurdling around; they lost their shape in midair and fell to a pile of dust.</p><p>Finally she found just the right one and, saying a silent apology to Jemma\u2019s beautiful lilac gloves, crossed her hand over her chest and spun the disc as hard as she could.</p><p>It didn\u2019t quite hit the sapling, but it went further than any of Damon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHow in the hell did you know how to do that?\u201d he said, a gratifying shock in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYour sister may be the best chess player in two countries,\u201d she said, pulling off her soiled gloves, \u201cbut I shall claim the title of best cowpat thrower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours. So where did you do your training, Lady Roberta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo training,\u201d she said, grinning at him. \u201cJust the ability to assess the mistakes of those who went before me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiss on that,\u201d Damon said, finding a disc-shaped cowpat for himself. Of course, when he tried the spinning method it went past the buoy. \u201cStill, you were there first,\u201d he said, very fairly. \u201cI think that\u2019s cleared a spot for a rug; what you do think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should walk through the woods and see how Teddy is swimming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to lounge in the dappled shade with me and practice your kisses? I could quote some poetry and ply you with wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard enough poetry in my life,\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>\u201cAh, but this is\u2014with excuses to your father\u2014a different brand of poetry. Come live with me, and be my love,\u201d he said, with exaggerated emphasis. \u201cYou will be my buttercup and I will be your\u2014your\u2014parsnip.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your love,\u201d Roberta said, giggling.</p><p>\u201cYou could give it a try.\u201d He put an arm around her waist and before she knew it she had her back against an old apple tree. His mouth looked very delectable, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cAre you really trying to seduce me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, leaning over to brush his mouth against hers.</p> <p>\u201cYou smell a little bit like a cowpat,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI could say the same to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I prefer to think of myself as perfumed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to think of you as naked,\u201d he said, his voice a husky murmur against the sound of birds singing.</p><p>She let him kiss her. Why not? He was a rogue, but such an enjoyable one. She relaxed against him, letting him slip into her mouth, start a game that made her heart pound. He had his hair tied back, so she pulled on the ribbon until all that loose silk fell into her hands, the way it had the previous night.</p> <p>He was kissing her with a breathless intensity now, his mouth slanting over hers, invading her, retreating. His lips were hot and beautifully full. She licked his lower lip and he let out a little noise, like a muffled groan.</p><p>It was so odd that she pulled back to stare at him.</p><p>That was a bad idea because Damon seemed to have shed his friendly exterior. He snatched her back so quickly she lost her breath, and kissed her hard, so her knees buckled. He had her against the tree trunk, and she could feel every hard curve of his body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push at me,\u201d she gasped. \u201cThis tree has bumps on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to protect you from those evil bumps,\u201d he said, sliding his hand over the curve of her bottom and pulling her against his body. He had bumps of his own, and her body welcomed each of them with feverish delight.</p><p>It made her feel weak and silly, capable of collapsing against him and squealing, take me, or something foolish of that nature. That dim suggestion was just enough to bring her thoughts together.</p><p>She pulled back and this time he let her go, bracing his arms on the tree on either side of her. Kissing made her feel delicate and fragile, all those things she wasn\u2019t and never could be.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to seduce me?\u201d he demanded. \u201cBecause, damn it, Roberta, you\u2019re about as close to success as I\u2019ve ever come with a marriageable young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she said, pushing his arms away. He had no reason to look quite so shocked at the idea that she might be seductive. \u201cYou know I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cBecause you\u2019re in love with Villiers, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other reasons,\u201d she said, straightening her skirts.</p><p>He still sounded a little stunned. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t in love, you still wouldn\u2019t want to seduce me?\u201d</p> <p>Roberta looked up at him. He had a look of utter disbelief on his face. He stood there, muscled and lean in his white shirt, his hair tousled by her hands, and his eyes narrowed. She started laughing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss you silent,\u201d he threatened.</p><p>So she sobered. \u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014well, you will fall in love someday, Damon, and then you\u2019ll see what I mean. You\u2019re awfully handsome and very sweet, funny and all the rest of it. Just not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet and funny?\u201d He ran a hand through his hair and it looked even wilder. \u201cDamn it, what happened to my ribbon?\u201d</p><p>She picked it up and watched as he pulled his hair back and tied it off his face. The style suited him; it made his cheekbones even more prominent.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever been in love?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I have,\u201d he said, smirking at her. \u201cMany a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really in love.\u201d</p><p>He pulled on his waistcoat. \u201cOf course I have been, you wench. The first time was a lass named Susan, and I\u2019ll have you know she was lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone from the village?\u201d she guessed, thinking of him as a young lad with a buxom barmaid.</p><p>\u201cLord Kendrick\u2019s daughter,\u201d he said, pulling on his coat. \u201cMarried a squire and lives in the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And did she love you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor at least a week. She sent me a letter drenched in scent. Which brought us to a tragic close, because our butler informed my father that I was receiving mail from a lady, and he cut off our friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness. He didn\u2019t want you to marry your Susan?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI was fourteen. And he\u2019d arranged my marriage already, though the poor lass died before we got to the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was Susan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn ancient woman of seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite precocious on your part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall watch Teddy like a hawk. Speaking of which...\u201d</p><p>They walked across the buttercups to a small grove of spindly trees. They were about half way through when Damon said suddenly, \u201cYou never told me why you wouldn\u2019t wish to seduce me if Villiers wasn\u2019t in the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I intend to marry. And unlike Susan I have enough sense to see that you are not the husband for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fourteen any longer. I have a title. Why would I be ineligible?\u201d</p><p>For some reason she felt like reassuring him, even though it was obviously all a jest. \u201cYou\u2019re very good looking. And very skilled at kissing.\u201d</p><p>He grinned down at her. \u201cThanks for those words of praise. But?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to marry me; you explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man. No good at explaining things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moment I saw Villiers, I knew he was perfect for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s an old stick who will never embarrass you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like you hugely, Damon. You can tell that I do. But I feel as if you are a family member, a cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were really my cousin I wouldn\u2019t be kissing you under an apple tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that it\u2019s all easy with you. And funny.\u201d She stopped, hands on her hips. \u201cDo you really think that you\u2019ll find yourself having a cowpat throwing contest with your bride?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. When you fall in love, your heart will pound so much that you won\u2019t be able to throw a mouse, let alone a cowpat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I could throw a mouse now. I dislike the idea of scrabbling little feet in my palm. Unless they were yours, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what I mean. You wouldn\u2019t be so silly if I were the right person for you. You\u2019d be too afraid to do or say the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhereas with you I don\u2019t give a damn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is my distinct impression,\u201d she said, walking a little faster because there was sunlight just a few trees away.</p><p>\u201cWell, in that case,\u201d he said, and a moment later she was spun around against a tree again and he was kissing her. Hard. When Damon kissed, there was nothing cousinly or funny or sweet about him.</p><p>At first she struggled a bit; had he no concern for the fact that she was marrying another?</p><p>But Damon was the sort of kisser who claimed mastery. Lord of his realm, etc. There was no fighting him when he\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She lost the thought. His fingers were warm on her back and his touch was singing through her dress.</p><p>Plus he was pushing against her again. Dimly, she realized that pushing was definitely part of male strategy. Mating strategy, one had to assume.</p><p>Fine.</p><p>She liked it.</p> <p>She wiggled a bit in response, and then noticed that his breathing got a little ragged, and she thought, aha, and did it again.</p><p>The trouble with Jemma\u2019s too-tight gowns was immediately clear when Damon wrapped his hand around the part of her breasts that plumped above her bodice. The bodice promptly lost its moorings and took her corset with it, leaving her whole breast open to his caress.</p><p>Dimly, Roberta knew that this had to stop.</p><p>For some reason Damon was taken with the idea of kissing her, and acting as if he wanted to seduce her\u2014all right, she was willing to admit that he did want to seduce her. But he wasn\u2019t the man she was in love with.</p><p>She jerked away from him.</p> <p>He made an odd little groaning sound, and then: \u201cI was enjoying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to kiss a woman who\u2019s thinking of another man?\u201d she asked him, angry for some reason.</p><p>He froze for a second. \u201cI suppose not. Particularly, I must admit, if you were thinking of Villiers. All that passion for chess. All that white hair. No, thank you. I like my hair as it is, and I find chess deadly boring. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never played.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cMy father made Jemma and myself play for hours and hours when we were children. Some pieces go one way and others go the other way. It\u2019s all about the queen, which\u201d\u2014he grinned at her\u2014\u201cI found tedious and Jemma did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall learn to play.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo point. Villiers will find it monotonous to play you, since you\u2019re a beginner. And he\u2019s not the type to suffer fools gladly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall think of ways to make it interesting for him,\u201d she said obstinately.</p><p>He looked amused but said nothing. A tale one of her father\u2019s courtesans had told her came to mind. \u201cWe\u2019ll play naked,\u201d she said.</p><p>He stopped short. \u201cRoberta St. Giles!\u201d</p><p>She dimpled at him. \u201cReeves breed true,\u201d she said, and took off with a toss of her head. They walked through the spinney to discover that Teddy was swimming like the proverbial fish, and Mr. Cunningham had taken an unlucky spill into the water.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I found?\u201d Teddy shouted. And he pranced out of the water, his little pizzle waving for all the world to see, uncurled his fingers and showed her his discovery.</p><p>\u201cA treasure?\u201d she asked. For a little boy, he was really quite beautiful. He had his father\u2019s tawny hair but his eyes were darker, and shot with amber specks.</p><p>His treasure was a piece of bottle glass, worn smooth.</p> <p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it\u2019s beautiful?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because\u201d\u2014he stuck a plump finger at the middle of it\u2014\u201ca star is there, just there. Do you see?\u201d</p><p>Roberta leaned over and sure enough, in the very middle was a tiny, lopsided etching of a star. She thought about correcting his sentence structure and dismissed it. \u201cThat is beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>When he smiled, one noticed that he was missing several teeth, which was a surprisingly attractive look. \u201cI expect this piece of glass was owned by a smuggler,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did the star come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a mystery,\u201d he said. And ran away.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>W hen Jemma took a bath, she invariably thought about chess. Once, six years ago, a Frenchman joined her in the bath and diverted her attention, but generally speaking, chess and the pleasures of warm water were intimately connected.</p><p>But this evening she couldn\u2019t seem to focus. Of course, both games had just begun, and there was much to think about. She had no idea what Villiers would play next, since they both made conventional pawn openings. Nor could she say what Elijah would do, though she could presumably hypothesize based on the games they played in the past. Jemma remembered every game she had played, and if she paid some attention, she could visualize the chess pieces moving, as if the years hadn\u2019t passed. Yet she and Elijah had played only three games, all in the first month of their marriage, before she discovered him tumbling his mistress.</p><p>She had won all three, but not easily. He played with a brilliant sense of forward strategy, but he was far more protective of his pieces than she was.</p><p>She played through one of their early games in her head and then leaned back with a sigh and wiggled her toes. She would beat him again. In all likelihood, he hadn\u2019t picked up a piece for years. Unless his mistress played.</p><p>One had to wonder whether his mistress was still au courant, as it were. Was her husband a man of loyalty? Did he have the pleasant, if foolish, habit of keeping to one mistress these many years, or had he moved on to a younger, fresher version of the same?</p><p>The thought made her feel sad\u2014stupid emotion!\u2014so she shook her head. \u201cBrigitte, did you get a chance to speak to any of Villiers\u2019s footmen?\u201d</p><p>Brigitte smiled the dimpled, triumphant smile of a Frenchwoman who eats English footmen for son petit d\u00e9jeuner. \u201cI have met a certain Joseph,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is not terrible. Red-haired, which my maman always called the mark of Cain. But not terrible. He is taking me to a certain gardens next week, where I will ask him the correct questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are brilliant,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI do hope you enjoy your evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has nice shoulders,\u201d Brigitte said. \u201cBut here is a question. The butler, that ungraceful one by the name of Fowle\u2014an abhorrent name\u2014asked me to inform you that he has received several solicitations to disclose the state of your various chess games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe games with Villiers and my husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui, those. The requests come from various newspapers, and also from a club called White\u2019s. They propose to pay Fowle a sum of the money if he will inform them every day of the position of the games with His Grace and the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Jemma slid down in the water. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Fowle cannot do so without my assistance,\u201d Brigitte said. \u201cAnd frankly, I told him that the thing cannot be done without your permission. The duchess plays many games of chess at the same time, all in the head, I told him. Bah! He does not understand chess, that one.\u201d</p><p>Jemma thought about it. There was only one reason to keep the information to herself that she could think of: the scandal of it. Elijah would loathe having the matches tracked in the press, or bets placed on his victory at White\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the answer is no,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Brigitte. I know that the newspapers would have paid well for the information.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte shrugged philosophically. \u201cFowle would likely have feathered his nest with most of it. Besides, I have Joseph to keep my feathers warm.\u201d And she laughed as only a Frenchwoman can.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>April 13</p><p>Day two of the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>Beaumont House</p><p>E lijah woke the next morning as the very first light came through his windows and almost groaned aloud as the details of the day before him burst into his head. Actually, they had been in his head all night long, because now he realized that he had been in the middle of a terrible dream in which the inner circle of Pitt\u2019s advisors had been invited to breakfast. He had found the room, but left to use the privy. And then wandered for hours through labyrinthine passageways under Lords trying to find his way back to breakfast. At one point he was in a room lined entirely with costumes, and a smirking Lord Corbin told him that a man of wit would always triumph over a laborer. Which, Elijah realized belatedly, referred to himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The day was when he would bound out of bed, eager to get to the House of Lords and tackle the enormous complexities of moving large groups of men to do exactly what he wished them to. These days he felt as if he staggered to the carriage.</p><p>His fainting episode last autumn didn\u2019t help.</p><p>He tried not to think about it too much; what man wants to contemplate his own mortality? But imperceptibly it crept into his thoughts and dreams so that it poisoned his every moment. The morning it happened he hadn\u2019t slept more than a few hours for two days. He was running on energy and will power, laying the groundwork for Pitt\u2019s takeover of Parliament.</p><p>And now Pitt was almost there. He was a good, solid man. Fox would have to retreat to his country house, St. Anne\u2019s Hill, and live with that courtesan he took with him everywhere. Pitt would usher in a new era without corruption, without scandal...</p> <p>Except for the scandals attached to Jemma, of course.</p><p>He ended up sitting on the edge of his bed, head in his hands. The truth of it was that he wasn\u2019t the Prime Minister and never would be. He was an attendant lord. A necessary one. An impassioned man at his best\u2014except he hadn\u2019t been at his best since last October.</p><p>The House of Lords had been in session. He was standing, talking of the madness of acceding to Fox\u2019s demands. Before him rose serried ranks of white wigs, beneath them the little faces with their mouths moving as they chattered to their neighbors, listening to him, listening to them...as was the custom. And yet he soldiered on, making his points for the fourth or the fifth time, because he\u2019d discovered that no one seemed to hear him the first, and sometimes even the fifth time.</p><p>And then it felt as if those little moving faces under the white wigs were disappearing, leaving rows and rows of wigs. He blinked and kept going, but the wigs were getting bigger and then there were no faces at all. And then, thankfully, it all went away.</p><p>He was grateful. He didn\u2019t care to be lecturing to nothing more than empty rows of wigs.</p> <p>Some six months had passed since that morning. The House went into recess and came out again. He showed no further signs of keeling over, though Pitt viewed him, he thought, with a certain veiled anxiety.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about all the empty wigs, and the tiny chattering mouths under them. The fact that his father died at thirty-four didn\u2019t help. That gave him only one year, measured against his father\u2019s life.</p><p>His valet bustled into the room. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a commotion below, Your Grace,\u201d he said. Elijah was quite aware that without Vickery\u2019s reports he wouldn\u2019t have the faintest idea what went in his own household, although before his wife returned from Paris, these reports were brief descriptions of Cook\u2019s lumbago, or the second footman\u2019s propensity for pocketing silver.</p><p>\u201cTeddy?\u201d</p><p>Vickery laughed. \u201cNo, the devil himself is already out of the house. His lordship hired the nursemaid sent by the Registry Office this morning, and she\u2019s taken him to the park. I\u2019ve my doubts of her tenure, as do we all. She\u2019s a prim one. And Master Teddy is fairly focused on\u201d\u2014he lowered his voice\u2014\u201cbodily processes, if you don\u2019t mind the comment, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Elijah snorted. \u201cSo what\u2019s the fuss about, if not Teddy? Are we having another ball?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLady Roberta\u2019s father sent a message saying he\u2019ll arrive this afternoon. Him as they call the Mad Marquess. It\u2019s luncheon with Mr. Pitt and the King today, isn\u2019t it, Your Grace? And a meeting before that. And then in the afternoon...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommittee for abolishment of the liberties. Then the Serene Company of Cloth Workers at their hall in Mincing Lane.\u201d</p><p>Vickery was a snob. \u201cWhy must you meet them?\u201d he demanded. \u201cWaste of your time, and they ought to make do with someone lower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are frightened that their workers will be committed to the poorhouse,\u201d Elijah said wearily. \u201cThey are afraid that the cheese makers are weaving their own muslin and so will make inroads into their business. In short, they are afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should be afraid in private,\u201d Vickery said with withering emphasis. He had the bath all ready. \u201cIf you please, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is Lady Roberta\u2019s father coming?\u201d Elijah asked, settling down as Vickery poured warm water over his head.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say,\u201d Vickery said, although this was nothing more than a diversion, since he always gave his opinion. \u201cI do believe he\u2019s thinking of staying for a time, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Elijah closed his eyes as Vickery massaged his head with a liquid soap that smelled of orange flowers. It was his one indulgence: a woman\u2019s soap, and a woman\u2019s practice of bathing every day. There were times when he didn\u2019t think he could go on, morning till night, without these two minutes of watery peace.</p> <p>\u201cWill you be home after the cloth makers?\u201d Vickery enquired, once he began rinsing away the soap.</p><p>Elijah sat there, eyes closed, in the peculiarly vulnerable position of one who is being washed rather than washing. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter the cloth makers there\u2019s a group of diplomats from America regarding the peace treaty. I can\u2019t miss that.\u201d</p><p>Vickery muttered something acid about jumped-up colonials that Elijah didn\u2019t quite catch, but he knew what the gist of it was\u2014that he was working himself to death.</p><p>It was an odd thought.</p><p>Death.</p><p>Or working and death in the same moment.</p><p>By all accounts, his father\u2019s heart stopped in mid-sentence. At least, Elijah thought, it must have been painless. His faint had been painless. One minute he was standing before a row of empty wigs; the next he woke up covered with cold water flung by a hysterical clerk. It would be so, presumably: in mid-sentence, without time for regrets or second thoughts...from light to darkness.</p><p>There was a small rebellious voice in his head that sounded louder these days. Elijah was very afraid that the voice was saying something about his father enjoying himself before he died.</p><p>\u201cHas there been much conversation about the duchess\u2019s propensity for chess?\u201d Elijah asked, feeling unutterably weary.</p><p>Vickery launched into a discussion of scandal that bounced from the duchess\u2019s various matches\u2014\u201cThere\u2019s been quite a lot of interest about that, Your Grace\u201d\u2014to the presence of Lord Gryffyn\u2019s illegitimate child, to the disputed centerpiece.</p><p>\u201cBut she was respectably clothed and depicting Helen of Troy,\u201d Elijah protested. \u201cWhat could possibly have upset anyone about her, unless they found her songs disreputable?\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, Vickery disclosed, Helen of Troy had voluntarily disrobed in the latter part of the evening. \u201cIt was almost dawn and there weren\u2019t many people left in the ballroom,\u201d Vickery said. \u201cBy all accounts, she was most remarkably painted. With pearls glued to her bosoms, as I heard it. Fowle said it gave him palpitations, but the footmen were more celebratory, if you conceive my meaning.\u201d</p><p>Elijah slumped back in his bath. \u201cIs the duchess aware this happened? Was she there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Your Grace,\u201d Vickery said. \u201cShe had already retired to her chambers. As I said, it was very late.\u201d</p><p>There were so many scandals brewing, Elijah thought. What was the addition of a mad marquess? With a sigh, he stood up and reached for a towel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo one can blame you for the situation,\u201d Vickery said, clearly meaning to be comforting. \u201cFox treats his Mrs. Armistead as if she were his very wife, and the world knows she is not.\u201d</p><p>Yet Fox\u2019s indiscretions had worked in Elijah\u2019s favor. He had convinced certain straitlaced gentlemen to question Fox\u2019s judgment, based on his inordinate love for a courtesan. Lord Holland once promised him his support purely on the basis of Fox\u2019s indiscreet relation with Mrs. Armistead. \u201cWill Fox never learn the importance of character?\u201d Holland had demanded, looking like a plump pigeon who had eaten a worm not to his liking. Elijah could just imagine what Holland thought of Jemma. Not to mention the naked centerpiece, if news of her pearls and paint was abroad.</p><p>Clearly he should no longer count on votes from those scandalized by impropriety. \u201cIf you have the Americans after the cloth makers,\u201d Vickery said, \u201cwhen will you be playing your chess move, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>Elijah tossed him the towel and ran his fingers through his hair. He kept it short as possible to make his wig more comfortable.</p> <p>He felt slightly better, though it was truly disturbing to realize how much he would have liked to retreat to bed or perhaps wander downstairs for a chat with the marquess. He liked poetry as much as the next person, though come to think of it he hadn\u2019t opened a book of poetry for years. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll fit it in,\u201d he said vaguely.</p><p>After a man and master have been together for years, they grow attuned to each other\u2019s moods. It was clear to Elijah by the time he had his stockings on that Vickery was not happy.</p><p>Vickery chose the moment when Elijah was positioning his wig to burst into a flurry of exclamations, all of which led to a few key conclusions:</p><p>The Duke of Villiers would play his second piece without fail.</p><p>The majority of the household had bet in favor of their master winning, Vickery included, and said master needed to play in order to win.</p> <p>And, finally, missing a day\u2019s play would be taken by all of London as a sign of weakness.</p><p>When Elijah thought about it in the carriage, he realized that missing a day would presumably be akin to an admission of impotence. He leaned toward his private secretary, Ransom Cunningham.</p><p>\u201cI must return home before the cloth makers,\u201d he said.</p><p>Cunningham opened his mouth to protest.</p><p>Elijah raised his hand. \u201cThe chess game,\u201d he said.</p><p>His secretary\u2019s mouth snapped shut. Elijah almost asked him if he had bet on Villiers or himself, but decided it was better not to know. \u201cDo you have any idea how the betting is going in White\u2019s?\u201d he asked casually.</p> <p>There was a moment\u2019s hesitation. Then: \u201cWell, Villiers is ranked first in England, Your Grace,\u201d Cunningham said with a look of pained apology.</p><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Elijah settled back in his seat.</p><p>It had been years since he played a game of chess. But he knew its lineaments and its bones. There had been a day when he had been Villiers\u2019s only serious opponent. Of course, they had last played when they were seventeen, but still, he fancied he had an advantage.</p><p>Not because he had once played Villiers.</p><p>But because he was Jemma\u2019s husband. To know an opponent was to be able to defeat him. Or her. It was exactly like politics, though he could never seem to make that clear to some idiots in government. He would meet the American diplomats and the cloth makers because, once he knew them, he could move them like little pawns around a chessboard of his own making.</p><p>The idea was rather soothing. In fact, one could say that he was better practiced for a game of chess than he had ever been in his life.</p><p>The only point that gave him the slightest hesitation was the tingling sense that it could be that he understood Americans and cloth makers better than his wife.</p><p>But that was a problem that could certainly be overcome. He added it to the great list of tasks that lived in a corner of his brain, and was consulted every hour or so. The list ranged from the small to the very large, from check the cellars of the house in Portman Square (for he had holdings all over the city) to strengthen connections with France, and Pitt be damned. Somewhere in the middle of the list he added: Get to understand Jemma.</p> <p>He thought about it and then annotated the entry.</p><p>Get to understand Jemma quickly before she wallops me and costs the loyal parts of my household their annual salaries.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>T he Duke of Villiers spent the morning at Parsloe\u2019s. He played a mediocre game of chess with a Russian who happened by, and then spent a solid three hours discussing queen sacrifices with Lord Corbin. It could be that Corbin might become a regular partner, which Villiers hadn\u2019t had since Berrow shot himself.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>Regret always struck Villiers as a foolish emotion, suited to poets and those who had nothing better to do with their time than weep over missteps. As in chess, as in life: it was all a vast game of attack, and one should waste no time regretting mistakes. He found it preferable to excise them from his memory.</p><p>But that game, that final game with Berrow...His memory stubbornly refused to forget it.</p><p>It had started simply enough. He was focused on pawns that year, and soon had his black pawns swirling around Berrow\u2019s white queen like a swarm of hostile ants. It was a brilliant tactical game, played against a weaker opponent, but not the less enjoyable for that.</p><p>Except...could he have done it differently?</p><p>Could he have headed off the moment when Berrow took himself home and put a gun to his head?</p><p>The question nagged and nagged. It visited him in his sleep sometimes, leading to dreams full of black pawns. If Berrow had taken his rook in the fourth move, his pawn attack would have collapsed.</p><p>But perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have pointed that out to Berrow after the game was over. Villiers hunched his shoulders, striding down the block toward Elijah\u2019s house. Odd that he still thought of the house as Elijah\u2019s, though the two of them had barely exchanged a word in years, and weren\u2019t on speaking terms, let alone the intimacy of first names.</p><p>Yet to all appearances, they were now playing for Elijah\u2019s queen. Whom Villiers didn\u2019t really want. All he wanted was someone to play with.</p><p>Or perhaps: all he wanted was Berrow to play with.</p><p>It was a maudlin thought and had Villiers banging the knocker with such a fierce scowl on his face that the butler fell back a pace. \u201cHer Grace awaits you,\u201d he said.</p><p>But Villiers was already on his way up the stairs. He shook off paltry regrets. Yesterday Jemma had played a pawn to King\u2019s Four, as had he. Likely she would move a knight.</p><p>She moved a pawn to Queen\u2019s Four; he promptly took her pawn with his from the day before.</p><p>He sat back. \u201cMay I see your husband\u2019s board?\u201d</p><p>The duchess shook back her delicate ruffles. She really was a remarkably beautiful woman, he noted with a certain detachment.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about Philidor\u2019s mode of play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a round little man with pince-nez. He is quite bald and\u2014\u201d Her eyes laughed at him.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like a pawn,\u201d Villiers guessed.</p><p>\u201cSlightly. One of the most interesting games I ever saw him play was one in which he was challenged beforehand to checkmate using his queen\u2019s bishop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA contract game...and such a difficult one. Fascinating!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sacrificed his queen, two rooks, a knight and a bishop, but he did it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Villiers sat for a moment, imagining the chess pieces flashing from place to place. He couldn\u2019t be certain how that game had gone, naturally, but he could see the beauty and complexity of it.</p><p>\u201cHe taught me a great deal about sacrifice,\u201d she continued. \u201cIn one game he took from me, he sacrificed his queen, promoted a pawn to a new queen, and won my queen rook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with him to celebrate his victory?\u201d he enquired.</p><p>She seemed unoffended. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think if I met someone who could play like that I would do everything in the world to bed her,\u201d he said, watching her.</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>She looked like a classic Greek statue, every feature in perfect symmetry. \u201cPlaying chess is like music and passion. It gives one a reason for living. Surely to combine two of them would be heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have made love while a violin played,\u201d she said. The secret smile playing at the corner of her mouth turned his blood hot.</p><p>\u201cBut have you made love to a master chess player?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt depends on one\u2019s definition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fit the definition. Philidor as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chess master with a resemblance to a pawn is not in my purview. And I feel I should add that Philidor is happily married and Madame Philidor would likely resent any encroachment upon her king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I should warn you that I myself have never viewed queens as being possessed by a king. Queens have so much more flare and daring: they move in every direction; they attack and counterattack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can certainly operate independently,\u201d she agreed and rose.</p><p>Villiers rose as well, conscious of a feeling of disappointment. He didn\u2019t want to leave. He wanted to stay in Jemma\u2019s bower, talking in double talk about chess and desire. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we play a game on the side?\u201d he said impulsively. \u201cA private game...one that is not being played out by days? Or do you only play games involving a daily move?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you mean by that do I need an entire sunset in order to think out my next move, the answer is no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen play with me,\u201d he appealed. \u201cI\u2019m tired of playing idiots. I have nothing particular to do. Let\u2019s play together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have to offer my husband the same courtesy.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cDo so. My impression is that Beaumont has no time for the games of mere mortals.\u201d</p><p>Jemma sat down again before the board. \u201cHe did once say something of the sort to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told Gentleman\u2019s Magazine that his chessboard was England.\u201d He started putting the pieces in place before she changed her mind.</p><p>Jemma turned back the ruffles that fell over her fingers, leaving her slender fingers and wrists free.</p><p>\u201cSo intriguing,\u201d he commented, watching her closely.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me think of undressing you. Women wear so much clothing...one lusts for the small amounts of flesh that make themselves visible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am beginning to think that you find everything sensual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my mind, there are two things worth doing, one out of bed and one in. Perhaps we should change the rules of the final game?\u201d</p><p>She turned the board around. \u201cYour advantage this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe final game blindfolded,\u201d he said, \u201cand in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how precisely would that work?\u201d she said, her mouth curving in a delicious lopsided way. \u201cWould my maid stand beside us, moving the pieces? You did say blindfolded, did you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never pay the slightest attention to servants. But if you would feel discomposed by her presence, we\u2019ll set up the chess board in the corridor and I shall call out our moves.\u201d Villiers caught himself before he started begging like a bishop blocked by a pawn. What was that about? He never begged. He took.</p><p>He scowled at the board and leaped his knight over the row of pawns. He didn\u2019t believe for a moment that she was as good as she claimed.</p><p>It incensed him that something in her eyes suggested she knew precisely what he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever resist the feeling?\u201d she asked some time later, as he was frowning down at the board. Her queen had just taken one of his knights. There was no good move that he could see.</p><p>\u201cResist what?\u201d he asked absentmindedly. Perhaps if he moved his queen to Bishop\u2019s Two...</p><p>\u201cResist women. Or a woman. Resist a woman whom you desire.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her. She had to know that her intelligence made her more luscious. She made no effort to hide it, never simpering or giggling, as far as he could see. Yet there was something odd about their match prickling the back of his mind. Why had she summoned him to her ball? Why was she challenging him?</p><p>It might have been simply for the pleasure of a match, of course. He looked back at the board.</p><p>She leaned toward him, and the curve of her breast was enticingly plump above her stiff bodice. \u201cDo you ever resist desire, Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery occasionally. I have felt impulses that I have not pursued; I feel that impoverished women would come to my bed with desperation, and the emotion is enough to dampen my appetite.\u201d</p><p>He bent forward and moved his pawn to take one of hers.</p><p>\u201cWomen resist desire as a matter of course,\u201d she said almost dreamily, taking a pawn of his in return.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many more consequences for the female sex.\u201d Suddenly he was scowling down at a game that had flipped from comfortable to...otherwise.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he said. It was the first comment either of them made for a few minutes.</p><p>Until: \u201cCheckmate,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>She leaned back in her chair and smiled at him. \u201cTo answer your earlier question...there won\u2019t be a third game unless we each win one.\u201d</p><p>Villiers nearly growled. Did she really think he would go down in both games? This was nothing but a side game, and he hadn\u2019t properly concentrated.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been amusing,\u201d she said, \u201cif you had moved that pawn to King\u2019s Bishop Three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have won,\u201d he agreed. He was already playing through all the moves in his head. \u201cI would have won, except that was the moment when you raised the question of desire.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth had a mocking curve to it that burned him to the bone. \u201cIf you survive to a third game,\u201d she said, rising again, \u201cyour proposition might be a very interesting one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat proposition?\u201d he asked, rising automatically, but still thinking through the game.</p><p>\u201cTo play our third game blindfolded, and in bed? It certainly would amuse the staff banished to the corridor. I shall consider it.\u201d</p><p>Villiers had never come quite so close to hating someone after whom he lusted. It was true that he hated\u2014if momentarily\u2014every person who beat him at a game of chess, but to have that person be a woman who seemed supremely insouciant about his offer to take her to bed was infuriating.</p><p>He walked behind her down the stairs, moodily assessing her narrow frame, the elegance of her shoulders, the beauty of the dull gleam of her hair...</p><p>Christ.</p><p>He\u2019d met a woman whom he really wanted\u2014and she was the first female to beat him at chess.</p><p>Quite possibly the two facts were not unrelated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was still something prickling the edge of his mind about these matches.

Surely not. He couldn\u2019t do this to her!</p><p>\u201cIs he alone?\u201d she asked, trying in vain to school her features into calm.</p><p>\u201cI believe the marquess has a companion,\u201d the footman replied, his face not yielding even a flicker about that companion.</p> <p>Of course he wasn\u2019t alone, she thought, despairing. Of course Mrs. Grope was with him.</p><p>\u201cIs the duchess in her chambers?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, your ladyship. Would you like me to enquire of Her Grace\u2019s maid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, he reported a few minutes later that the duchess was playing chess with the Duke of Villiers, although she promised to join Lady Roberta at her first opportunity.</p><p>She had to decide what to do. Figure out how to make her father leave. It was like a musical beat in her head. He had to leave, leave, leave.</p><p>\u201cPlease send Lord Gryffyn my compliments and ask him if he would meet me in the library,\u201d she said to the footman.</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cWhat shall I tell the marquess, your ladyship?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease convey my apologies. Tell him I am not ready to receive visitors. I shall attend him at the earliest possible moment.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t help when Damon burst into laughter on hearing her request.</p><p>\u201cHelp you get rid of your father? An uncharitable act, and not worthy of a member of the family of Reeve.\u201d He gave her a lofty look.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease! You have no idea what he\u2019s like. He\u2019s going to ruin everything.\u201d Tears were threatening.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I possibly do?\u201d He frowned at her. \u201cNo crying. Thoughtless rakes like myself can\u2019t bear to see a woman cry; it reminds us of all those we left weeping on the roadside.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even manage a smile at his foolery. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love him,\u201d she said, gripping her hands together. \u201cIt\u2019s just that he\u2019s eccentric. He doesn\u2019t care what people think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever! He never has. You\u2019ll see what I mean when you meet him. Mrs. Grope is only the latest of the courtesans with whom he has been passionately in love. She has lived with us for the past two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grope?\u201d Damon asked with some interest. \u201cIs there a Mr. Grope still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no particular belief in the existence of Mr. Grope. Except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho would choose that name on its own? I agree entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease take me seriously,\u201d Roberta said, dropping into the couch. \u201cI simply cannot stay in London if my father is here. Please!\u201d</p><p>Damon sat down beside her. \u201cAm I allowed to call you Roberta yet?\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing cousins,\u201d he said, dropping a kiss on her eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her. \u201cWhat\u2019s so terrible about your father, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grope,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cis something of a liability in terms of my reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are liabilities and liabilities. One would think that Teddy would be a liability, for example, but his presence in my home doesn\u2019t seem to have put off the matchmaking mamas a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind deserting the fascinating topic of your popularity for one moment,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cno matchmaking mamas are going to enter this house while Mrs. Grope is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would prove useful,\u201d he said, grinning at her. \u201cMrs. Grope won\u2019t stop your old rou\u00e9 from entering the house, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers is not a rou\u00e9!\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cClose enough. But the point is that you can seduce him here or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not the point. You have no idea how humiliating it is being around my father.\u201d</p><p>Damon wrapped an arm around her shoulder and pulled her a little closer. \u201cTell me your tales of horror and I\u2019ll do my best to comfort you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Roberta said, but as usual he paid no attention to her. He bent his head and kissed her cheek, which wasn\u2019t very intrusive, so she ignored him. \u201cMy father is prone to falling on his knees and bursting into tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Damon murmured, kissing her ear.</p><p>\u201cIt is not interesting,\u201d Roberta said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI know he fell to his knees and implored the heavens for a husband who would never kiss you in public. Obviously, I would not qualify.\u201d His lips had drifted down and he was kissing her neck now.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roberta agreed. There was something oddly distracting about those feathery touches of his lips.</p><p>\u201cThat was bad enough,\u201d she said, struggling to get her mind back to her story, \u201cbut then Rambler\u2019s Magazine\u2014\u201d</p><p>At the end of that story, he stopped kissing her and actually looked at her with something approaching sympathy. For a moment she felt a thrill that he finally understood how dreadful her situation was, but: \u201cYou are nothing more than an example of incestuous inbreeding and I never noticed!\u201d he cried. \u201cI\u2019ve sinned by having anything to do with you. Give me my sin again...\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her and for a moment Roberta lost track of her complaints because he was saying things about sin in a husky voice, and his hands touched her front in an improper manner that turned her mind to smoke.</p><p>\u201cFeeling better?\u201d he enquired, sometime later.</p><p>Roberta blinked at him for a moment and then straightened up. \u201cI think so,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>Damon looked pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cIs this your kindly way of assuring me that you\u2019re going to convince my father to go back home so that I can marry the Duke of Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you reward me for my services?\u201d he asked with a ridiculous leer.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go kiss one of those girls who want you so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that you don\u2019t enjoy my kisses?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roberta burst out laughing. \u201cAnyone would enjoy your kisses! But you know I\u2019m in love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>His eyes had turned a dark sea green and she knew what that meant. \u201cI think that\u2019s why you\u2019re so irresistible to me,\u201d he said, his voice deep as his eyes. \u201cYou belong to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d she said, but he was kissing her again. And truly, she did love kissing him. In fact, she dimly thought that she could do it all day, except her father must be wondering why she was taking so long to dress.</p><p>A while later she gasped when his hand found her breast. She slapped his hand away. \u201cI don\u2019t belong to Villiers yet, but I\u2019m not open territory either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want me,\u201d he prompted, a sardonic note in his voice.</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><p>He burst out laughing. \u201cTry to play a docile maiden at least until after your wedding, could you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a maiden,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cSo you do want me.\u201d The words hung on the air, like some sort of challenge.</p> <p>Roberta wasn\u2019t going to lie. Lust, as any poet\u2019s daughter knows, is nothing beside true love. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same way that I feel about Villiers.\u201d</p><p>A moment later she felt sorry she\u2019d clarified the point, because something flew across Damon\u2019s eyes, and she thought perhaps she\u2019d hurt his feelings.</p><p>She tugged her bodice back into place. \u201cPlease help me send Papa back to the country.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her and sighed. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s no more than a cousin\u2019s duty.\u201d</p><p>They walked into the drawing room to find the marquess holding forth to a nonplussed Fowle. The butler was standing next to the door, as if he were on the point of flight. Even from the corridor Roberta could tell that her father was on one of his favorite subjects. \u201cShe was like a basilisk,\u201d he said, \u201cher eyes killed every man at whom she has glanced.\u201d She realized with a sinking heart that her father had launched into the story of how he fell in love with Mrs. Grope.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grope is a high-spirited woman,\u201d Papa was saying as they entered. With his hands clasped behind his back, the marquess looked like a rather dapper magistrate. Roberta always found it interesting how very sensible her father appeared to be, though five minutes of conversation were generally enough to convince people of his unique views.</p> <p>\u201cPapa,\u201d she said, dropping a curtsy. \u201cWhat a lovely surprise this is, to be sure. Mrs. Grope.\u201d She dropped another curtsy.</p><p>Mrs. Grope had dressed her hair enormously high for the occasion. It towered in a series of curls and arabesques before being topped off by a small replica of London Bridge.</p><p>Damon came forward and swept a bow. \u201cPapa, Mrs. Grope, this is Damon Reeve, the Earl of Gryffyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy darling daughter,\u201d her father said, catching her into a hug that ignored her curtsy altogether. \u201cLord Gryffyn, I remember seeing you in the T\u00eate-\u00e0-T\u00eate series, was it a year ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d Roberta interrupted. \u201cThis is a most unexpected pleasure and yet I must ask...why are you paying me a visit?\u201d That was bald, but straightforward.</p><p>\u201cThe most delightful thing, dear child!\u201d he cried. \u201cMy book, my magnum opus!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA publisher?\u201d Roberta asked, feeling truly startled.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly\u2014not yet\u2014not entirely\u2014but soon!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were positively longing for some entertainment,\u201d Mrs. Grope said, putting a hand to her bosom. \u201cWithering in the country, that\u2019s what I said to your dear father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Papa, you said that London was nothing more than a nest of vipers,\u201d Roberta said, feeling as if sand was shifting under her feet.</p><p>\u201cBut then I bethought me,\u201d he said, beaming at her. \u201cIf I accompanied you to London, I could follow up on this matter of a publisher. A publisher is a consummation devoutly to be wished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Damon said, amusement underlying his voice. \u201cAnd you, Mrs. Grope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a creature of the theater,\u201d she said, striking an attitude. \u201cI live for the moment when we enter Drury Lane, scene of my triumph.\u201d</p><p>Roberta shuddered. Mrs. Grope had \u201ctrod the boards,\u201d as she had it, before meeting the marquess in Bath and returning home with them. After one quick glance at Damon, she had turned herself at a right angle to him and stood with her elegant, if rather long, nose pointed into the distance. She was wearing more rouge than usual, Roberta thought uncharitably; her flush went from her jaw to under her eyes. \u201cAh, the days of yore when I conquered the boards!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cThe role of Elisabetina in The Clandestine Marriage,\u201d Papa explained to Damon, who was doing a very credible job of keeping a sober face. \u201c\u2019Tis a sad comedown for a woman of her beauty to leave the stage, especially when the Prince of Wales himself delivered his commendations in person. Yet she did me the inexpressible joy of allowing me to become her patron.\u201d He went down on one knee to kiss Mrs. Grope\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d Roberta began.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he beamed at her. \u201cWe won\u2019t get in your way. I\u2019ll assure the duke himself of that. And his lovely duchess. I\u2019ve seen her picture many a time in the T\u00eate-\u00e0-T\u00eate column. Many a time! I expect now we\u2019re in London, it\u2019s a matter of time before my own Mrs. Grope is appearing there, but I certainly hope my picture will be opposite hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my sister\u2019s absence, I welcome you both to Beaumont House,\u201d Damon interjected, bowing. \u201cFowle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf your lordship would allow us a few more minutes, Mrs. Friss is readying chambers for our guests. I will ascertain her progress,\u201d he said, bowing himself from the room.</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d Roberta said pleadingly. \u201cI really don\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t want you here.\u201d</p><p>His face fell, of course. That was the worst of it, and the reason why she was unmarried at one-and-twenty. His face fell, and he looked as if he were about to cry. \u201cDon\u2019t say that, dearest. I haven\u2019t been able to sleep since you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more he has,\u201d Mrs. Grope said promptly.</p><p>Roberta threw her a beseeching look. She thought that Mrs. Grope, at the least, had understood how important it was that she find a husband. But Mrs. Grope sent her a rueful smile that admitted her total lack of influence.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t slept, and I haven\u2019t written a single poem in three days,\u201d the marquess said, opening his eyes very wide. \u201cHow could I, when I had no idea with whom my child was consorting? How can I have allowed my own duckling, my little chicken, to wander the cold streets of London by herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am hardly wandering the streets of London,\u201d Roberta said, controlling her voice to a reasonable level with difficulty.</p><p>\u201cI woke in the middle of the night, and I knew I did wrong,\u201d her father wailed, a tear sliding down his cheek. \u201cWhat would Margaret say, I asked myself?\u201d</p><p>Damon nudged her.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d she told him.</p><p>She folded her arms and waited; from long experience she knew that her father was only now getting into his stride. \u201cMargaret would say I was wrong\u2014wrong\u2014wrong.\u201d More tears fell down his face. Mrs. Grope patted his face with her handkerchief. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat is likely true,\u201d Roberta said, feeling not a whit of sympathy. \u201cMother would not have been pleased with my journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I have let that happen?\u201d the marquess said, with a sniffle. \u201cMy child...the dearest to my heart...my jasmine blossom\u2014in the second best coach escorted only by servants!\u201d</p><p>Roberta opened her mouth to say something about the poem he sent to Jemma, but Damon nudged her again. \u201cGive over,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her father put a hand in his pocket and took out an enormous bundle of banknotes. \u201cFor you, dearest, for you. I know you don\u2019t like Mrs. Parthnell\u2019s sewing skills, though I cannot but ask myself who will employ her now that you are gone? But still, Mrs. Grope\u2019s patronage counts for something.\u201d</p> <p>Mrs. Grope smiled grimly. Before Roberta left, she had very kindly tried to make Mrs. Parthnell\u2019s creations into something worth wearing to London. But there was the unmistakable odor of Mrs. Parthnell around Mrs. Grope\u2019s current garment. It was fashioned from lovely striped fabric, but the lines were designed to come to a V in the front of the bodice\u2014and they didn\u2019t. It was odd, to say the least, and as Roberta watched, Mrs. Grope adjusted her arms across her chest the better to disguise the defect.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you, all for you,\u201d her father was saying, pushing the banknotes at her. \u201cThe St. Giles family has never taken charity, and there\u2019s no need to do so. After all, you are an heiress according to the mercantile standards by which people judge these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Papa,\u201d she said. The roll was far too large to fit into her pocket. Damon stuck out his hand, and she read deep enjoyment in his eyes. She handed the notes to him.</p><p>\u201cPapa,\u201d she said, but he looked so uncertain she couldn\u2019t bring the words to her lips.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why I didn\u2019t think of it before,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cLondon is the path to all of our deepest hearts\u2019 desires. I expect publishers never accept a manuscript until they have made the acquaintance of its author. Why, it might be a work of the very weakest moral fiber and they wouldn\u2019t know without personal assessment. Don\u2019t you agree, my lord?\u201d He turned to Damon.</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cWere I a publisher, I would insist on a personal interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d the marquess said, as Roberta shot Damon a murderous look. \u201cI shall be published, you shall be married, and Mrs. Grope...ah, Mrs. Grope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of Mrs. Grope?\u201d Damon asked.</p><p>\u201cShe tried to persuade me against this, from the depths of her loving kindness,\u201d the marquess roared. \u201cBut I know she has ambitions. I know the truth of it. Rather than be oppressed in the country, a lady as beautiful as Mrs. Grope should be celebrated in every bookstore window, and I\u2019ve no doubt but that she will be. Look at her, my dear sir, just look at her!\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Grope was doing a very credible job of keeping her gaze on the far distance and her chin high in the air.</p><p>\u201cI cannot fool myself that she will stay under my protection,\u201d the marquess said with a heavy sigh. \u201cBut I cannot but be oppressed by the idea that I may have caused distress to the two women I love most in the world: my daughter, and my dear Mrs. Grope, the love of my bowels.\u201d</p> <p>At this propitious moment, the door opened and Fowle appeared. \u201cHer Grace, the Duchess of Beaumont,\u201d he said. And: \u201cHis Grace, the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Roberta would have fainted, if she\u2019d known how.</p><p>\u201cPlease allow me to introduce my sister, Her Grace, the Duchess of Beaumont,\u201d Damon said to the marquess. \u201cJemma, this is Mrs. Grope, and the famed poet, the Marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow I enjoyed the poem that dear Roberta brought me,\u201d Jemma said, curtsying.</p><p>\u201cA trifle, a mere trifle,\u201d the marquess said, blotting a last tear. \u201cI am not yet entirely happy with it...I believe I shall take out the bear and the swearing parson, when all\u2019s done. I won\u2019t publish it until it\u2019s in its finest state, when I bring out all my collected works in a folio edition. This version is for your eyes only. My gift for your kindness in sheltering the pearl of my bosom, my only daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre your collected works forthcoming?\u201d Jemma asked, curtsying to Mrs. Grope. \u201cA pleasure, dear madam,\u201d she said, as Mrs. Grope\u2019s curtsy took her nearly to the floor.</p><p>\u201cI have no doubt it will happen, in leather with pearl bindings,\u201d the marquess said. He made a leg to Villiers. \u201cI knew your father of old,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot always an unmixed blessing to make my father\u2019s acquaintance,\u201d Villiers allowed.</p> <p>\u201cI fear he did not understand literature. Not at all. I was in my salad days, you understand, but I already had a fine grasp of music and rhythm. Your father said something abominably rude; I shan\u2019t repeat it. But I remember every word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are more and more in sympathy every moment,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI too have several signal lectures delivered by my father emblazoned in my memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe that as it might,\u201d the marquess said, \u201cit was an excellent poem. A light subject, but heartfelt in its every pentameter. I still remember it.\u201d</p><p>Roberta\u2019s heart sank. Sure enough, a moment later her father launched into fifteen verses that began, For I will consider my Cat Jeoffry. Even Roberta, who was well versed in literature, couldn\u2019t follow much other than the rhyming couplets that occasionally popped up like way posts in a dark night.</p><p>There was a moment of silence after he finished while (Roberta assumed) the assorted company tried to ascertain whether the poem was truly over.</p><p>\u201cI never ask my daughter to critique my work,\u201d her father said, in a magnificent untruth, \u201cas her literary judgment is far harsher than her pleasant exterior promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnnatural child,\u201d Damon whispered.</p><p>She shot him a squinty-eyed look and he shut up.</p><p>Just as Roberta realized with a queer little pang that her father\u2019s feelings were going to be hurt, how could they not be hurt, Damon said: \u201cImmensely moving in every lineament and emotion, my lord. I think the line he counteracts the powers of darkness by his electrical skin and glaring eyes, and you must forgive me if I have that wrong, was particularly penetrating in its analysis.\u201d</p><p>Her father beamed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very sad in the end,\u201d Jemma ventured. \u201cDid I understand that a rat bit Jeoffry\u2019s throat?\u201d</p><p>The marquess nodded, rocking back and forth on his heels. \u201cA sad demise for such a splendid quadruped. There is nothing sweeter than his peace,\u201d he quoted, heaving an enormous sigh. \u201cHe died a few days after. Your father,\u201d he said, turning to Villiers, \u201cwas rather unkind in his assessment of that poem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why,\u201d Villiers said, his voice as sleek as any cat\u2019s. \u201cFather didn\u2019t like felines. If Jeoffry had been a hunting dog...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh now, if only he had explained that to me,\u201d the marquess said, beaming. \u201cSome people have unusual fears of domesticated animals, as I well know. Why, Mrs. Grope is terrified, purely terrified, of camels.\u201d</p><p>They all turned like puppets to stare at Mrs. Grope. \u201cMiggery\u2019s Traveling Circus,\u201d she said with a shudder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roberta felt like moaning. Thankfully, Jemma was smiling and didn\u2019t seem inclined to throw them all out.</p><p>Suddenly a large hand squeezed Roberta\u2019s. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Damon said in her ear. \u201cThis house is big enough for all of Miggery\u2019s Traveling Circus.\u201d</p><p>Even as Damon spoke, her papa was delightedly accepting the duchess\u2019s invitation to stay. \u201cBut only for a night or two,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind to open up my house. I have one, you know, child,\u201d he said, turning to Roberta. \u201cI expect you\u2019ve forgotten that.\u201d</p><p>Forgotten? How could she possibly have known that?</p> <p>\u201cA large one it is, on St. James\u2019s Square as I recall,\u201d he said, frowning a bit. \u201cI inherited it from someone or other. My relatives have dropped like fleas in the past few years,\u201d he told the company at large. \u201cI\u2019m composing a sort of universal poem of commiseration that can be applied to many occasions. It\u2019s the only prudent thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will leave Roberta here with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>The marquess frowned. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Mrs. Grope proved herself a true friend. \u201cIf\u2014\u201d she said magnificently, viewing them all, a duke, an earl, a marquess, a duchess and Roberta\u2014\u201cI am to achieve the fame which I heartily deserve, I cannot be disturbed by the presence of a young lady in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut dearest\u2014\u201d the marquess bleated.</p> <p>She raised her hand. Just so did Moses part the Red Sea. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is for the best,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Villiers put in, rather unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cYou think so, do you? And why is that?\u201d the marquess asked.</p><p>\u201cI could not pay my addresses to a young lady living in the proximity of an actress,\u201d he said, \u201ceven such an exquisite woman as Mrs. Grope.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Grope bowed her head magnificently, as one receiving her due. Damon\u2019s hand fell from Roberta\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cPay your addresses, eh?\u201d her father said, looking rather deflated. \u201cI suppose the world is coming to a place where I might have to give my only daughter to one who doesn\u2019t understand poetry.\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked at Roberta and she felt the thrill of it to the bottom of her spine. \u201cShe has not yet accepted my hand,\u201d he said.</p><p>Roberta couldn\u2019t think what to say. Was that a proposal?</p><p>\u201cDoubtless she will consider your merits in due time,\u201d her father said. \u201cRoberta can look to the very highest in the land when she decides to choose a spouse.\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s sardonic look indicated that he was the very highest in the land, but luckily, Fowle reentered the room and announced that the chambers had been prepared if Mrs. Grope and the marquess would be so kind as to follow him.</p><p>Jemma led the way, the marquess\u2019s hand tucked in her arm, and Villiers held his arm out to Mrs. Grope. So Roberta and Damon followed. For some reason she felt rather shy about meeting his eyes.</p><p>He pulled her back as they were about to leave the room.</p><p>\u201cDamme,\u201d he said and she could hear incredulity in his voice. \u201cWhat the devil are you about, Roberta?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers? How did you manage that?\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cNeed there be an explanation that involves trickery?\u201d Although to tell the truth, she couldn\u2019t quite believe what had just happened.</p><p>Neither did Damon, obviously. He raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cWhat in Hades did you do to the man, to get him to the point without witchcraft?\u201d</p><p>She turned up her nose. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he wish to marry me? Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m desirable?\u201d</p><p>The moment she said it, she knew she had said the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re particularly desirable now that you\u2019re almost engaged to someone else,\u201d he said, and sure enough, there she was backed up against the silk paneled wall of the drawing room as Damon pushed the door shut behind Mrs. Grope.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more desirable in the world than a woman planning to marry someone else,\u201d he whispered, brushing his lips against hers.</p><p>She felt as if heat struck her in the face the moment he tasted her. Or perhaps it was the moment she tasted him. There was something deliciously wicked about kissing one man when another has almost asked you to marry him.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing this,\u201d she whispered back. He kissed her harder. She discovered she was breathing in little pants.</p><p>\u201cI should be doing this,\u201d he said. His hands were on her breasts as if they belonged there. Her bodice skimmed below her nipples without putting up a fight. Damon was looking down at her with an odd little smile on his mouth and doing something with his hands.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d she said foolishly.</p><p>\u201cFeels good?\u201d he asked, crooking one eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d she choked.</p><p>With one swift movement he pulled down on her bodice again and it slipped below her right breast as simply as if it weren\u2019t designed to do precisely the opposite. Her breast spilled into his hand.</p><p>\u201cRoberta,\u201d he said, and the huskiness in his voice made a strange warmth grow between her thighs. Or perhaps it was what he was doing with his thumb.</p><p>Roberta clutched his forearms. \u201cThis is scandalous,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not engaged yet,\u201d he said, sounding happy. And uncaring. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s all the more delicious for being surreptitious.\u201d</p><p>And then, while she was still figuring out what he meant because her brain seemed to have taken a little holiday, he laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019m writing poetry!\u201d</p><p>Just when she would have kicked him in the ankle, his mouth replaced his hand at her breast. Roberta was no fool. There are times in life when sagging against the wall is exactly the right thing to do, and luckily one of his arms held her up.</p><p>Arching her back toward his mouth felt like the right thing too. And whimpering when he took that delicious warm mouth away.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d he whispered</p><p>Her eyes opened lazily. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He pulled up her bodice and rather to Roberta\u2019s surprise, it slid back into place as if it had always been there.</p><p>\u201cYour father is doubtless wondering where you are. He is endearingly fond of you.\u201d</p><p>Roberta didn\u2019t feel like being a daughter. She felt like lying down, and she saw the same thought in his eyes. So she scowled at him. \u201cYou were no help to me whatsoever. I thought you were going to help me steer my father toward returning to the country.\u201d</p><p>He tucked a stray curl back into the elaborate nest of curls her maids had created that morning. \u201cIt was impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy impossible?\u201d she asked, feeling churlish.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you too much. Jemma and I never saw much of our parents except when my father lectured us about chess, but I can recognize parental love when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Teddy,\u201d she said as he opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI should warn Teddy now,\u201d Damon said, looking faintly horrified. \u201cI\u2019ll embarrass him in public, falling on my knees and imploring docile young ladies to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Roberta sighed. \u201cIf only papa wasn\u2019t so demonstrative. If only he didn\u2019t cry so frequently.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe worst is over.

Your papa will take the estimable Mrs. Grope to his house and have a lovely time guarding her against the entreaties of all those gentlemen who will want to take her away from him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be cruel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think what would be truly cruel is if Mrs. Grope doesn\u2019t get at least one lure thrown out to her. He\u2019s so hoping for rivalry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t truly want rivals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA rival or two would make for some excellent poetry. At any rate, my point is that your papa and Mrs. Grope will take themselves off, and you will be chaperoned by Jemma. No one will close their doors on Jemma, for all she\u2019s flaunted her indiscretions for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she indeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fault of her foolish husband and his mistress,\u201d Damon said. \u201cOf course, she is a Reeve. Will the strain breed true in you, do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy I\u2014\u201d She stopped. Would she have affaires?</p><p>\u201cOf course you will,\u201d Damon answered her unspoken question. \u201cVilliers is not the sort of man to demand or even desire your entire attention. You see how lucky you are that I did not appear at your New Year\u2019s ball?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cJemma can tell you that I was a most annoying brother,\u201d he said. \u201cI never share. And\u2014I would never share you.\u201d</p><p>Roberta opened her mouth to reply but there was nothing to be said.</p><p>Chapter 20</p> <p>E lijah came home after the cloth makers and before the Americans, instructing his coachman to dash across London as if the hounds of hell were after him, while inside the coach he bent his head over pieces of foolscap covered with Pitt\u2019s small, crabbed writing. They danced before his eyes: notes about French connections, about the mood in the House of Commons, about the recent election.</p><p>He strode into the house with a headache, to find his butler, Fowle, dancing before him in an ecstasy of impatience. \u201cIf you\u2019ll please, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no time,\u201d he said automatically, allowing a footman to take his cloak from his shoulders and tossing his hat on the chair. He didn\u2019t take off his wig. It was beastly hot, but what was the point? Play the chess piece and leave the house within ten minutes and he had a chance of getting to the Americans at the appointed time.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Fowle said, \u201cI must speak to you!\u201d</p><p>His tone was so desperate that Elijah paused with one foot on the bottom stair.</p><p>Two moments later he pounded up those same stairs and threw open the door leading to his chambers. She was seated before the chess table, of course.</p><p>He sat down, calming himself with a fierce interior command. Jemma looked up with a smile, but her greeting died\u2014at the look on his face, presumably.</p><p>\u201cAm I to understand that you have moved a woman of ill repute into the house?\u201d he said, sitting down and moving a pawn to Queen Four. He had thought out that move in five minutes between one meeting and another, and he certainly didn\u2019t have time to reconsider it now.</p> <p>She echoed his move just as quickly. Then she sat back, hands folded. \u201cThe Marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury arrived this afternoon. Surely, you were informed of his imminent visit this morning, as was I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was not informed that he arrived with a doxy in tow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unfortunate omission,\u201d she said. \u201cA Mrs. Grope does indeed accompany him.\u201d</p><p>The immense injustice of it blocked his throat for a moment. \u201cDo you have any idea,\u201d he finally said, hearing the harsh sound of his voice behind his teeth, \u201cwhat this will do to my career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Will it cause injury?\u201d</p><p>Her look of enquiry fueled his rage. \u201cDon\u2019t play the fool with me, Jemma,\u201d he hissed at her. \u201cYou and I have been married far too long for that. I know that you are intelligent; I know that you can easily conceive why it would be a bad idea for a member of the House of Lords to invite a woman of ill repute to live in his house!\u201d</p><p>She looked genuinely sorry. \u201cThere was nothing I could do about it, Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend them to Nerot\u2019s Hotel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could not be so rude. There may possibly be a few straitlaced matrons who will not visit the house during her stay with us, but I am perfectly happy to hold no entertainments. That way no such matrons can have an opportunity to announce their qualms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long does she stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days only. The marquess talks of opening his house here in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a dislike of opening myself to entirely valid criticism of my household arrangements,\u201d Elijah said. His throat closed before he could say anything further.</p><p>\u201cI could not turn her out. But I assure you that I hadn\u2019t the faintest idea that the marquess might pay a visit to his daughter, nor that such a person as Mrs. Grope existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you, indeed?\u201d he said it woodenly. His wig felt as if it weighed a good stone.</p><p>With one swift look at him, Jemma rose and walked behind him. Automatically he began to rise, but she pushed his shoulders down and pulled off his wig. It came away with a little cloud of powder. She fluttered her hands to make it go away.</p><p>\u201cMust you?\u201d she asked. \u201cVilliers never wears one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is hardly decent; he doesn\u2019t even powder his hair. Villiers is no one.\u201d He said it wearily, but truly. Villiers didn\u2019t have the ear of the King, nor even the ear of Fox, Pitt\u2019s great rival. He was no one.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d his wife said. Her fingers began to gently knead his scalp, touching him here and there. Her touch had the cool blessedness of water.</p><p>He leaned his head into her hands, a gesture of weakness and yet...She was his wife. What mattered weakness before her? She didn\u2019t love him, nor he her, but there was a bond there, between husband and wife, that was different from any other bond.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, sounding uncharacteristically uncertain, \u201cyou ought to reduce your appointments, Beaumont. You don\u2019t appear well.\u201d</p><p>For a moment he just enjoyed the feeling of her slender fingers working through his hair, taking away the tightness of his scalp. And then her words filtered through to his brain.</p><p>\u201cAppointments!\u201d He swore and leapt from the chair. A moment later he snatched his wig and threw it on his head, helter-skelter. Made a leg to his lady, filing away a thought about how very beautiful she was for some other moment, and rushed from the room.</p><p>Jemma was left, staring down at the chess table.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>April 14</p><p>Day three of the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>R oberta felt as if she\u2019d fallen through a hole in the wall and ended up in Miggery\u2019s Traveling Circus. Events swirled around her in which she played no part. She had envisioned a grand seduction campaign. She had planned to bribe Villiers\u2019s footmen and to trap him into marriage. She had schemed to use a substitute wedding certificate. But, in the end, what was necessary?

The Duke of Villiers had declared his intention to court her, in front of her papa, but what did that mean?</p><p>The question had kept her awake. Could it have just been an unscrupulous jest on his part? But a package was delivered the next morning. It was a soft bundle of pale blue velvet tied in ribbon, about the size of an expensive bible. When she untied it, a card fell to the floor. She snatched it up and found spiky black letters that were indubitably no one\u2019s but Villiers\u2019s.</p><p>I have no Familiarity with Courtship. Pray do not abuse your Power, Fair One. I find this trifle Reminds me of you.</p><p>A special volume of Shakespeare\u2019s poetry, she thought. There was more blue velvet. And when that fell open...Not Shakespeare. It was a portrait. It showed a young country girl wearing a simple dress and holding a small cage.</p> <p>\u201cOh, how lovely!\u201d Jemma cried, when Roberta showed it to her a few minutes later. \u201cIt\u2019s painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, of course. How exquisite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you suppose she is holding a mouse trap?\u201d Roberta asked.</p><p>\u201cIs that what it is?\u201d Jemma peered closer and something indefinable crossed her face. Could it be longing\u2014or\u2014or jealousy? Roberta\u2019s heart thumped. She wanted Villiers; she wanted her friendship with Jemma almost as much.</p><p>But Jemma was gay in her answer. \u201cDarling, it\u2019s a mousetrap because\u2014well\u2014you do know the old adage about marriage, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Roberta frowned. \u201cA trap?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe parson\u2019s mousetrap.\u201d Jemma\u2019s laughter sounded clear and true, and not at all tainted by jealousy.</p><p>Roberta didn\u2019t like the portrait quite as much as she had a moment before.</p><p>\u201cPure Villiers,\u201d Jemma was saying. \u201cAn exquisite, hideously expensive gift...any other man would have sent you a ruby. His present has a hidden jest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if he\u2019s thumbing his nose at me?\u201d Roberta asked.</p><p>\u201cOh no. He\u2019s sharing the joke, don\u2019t you see? Marriage is madness, you know. He\u2019s making a joke of it, because one can hardly do otherwise.\u201d</p><p>One couldn\u2019t? Somehow...Roberta could see it otherwise. Though that was foolish beyond all measure, given that she was the same woman who planned to cold-bloodedly trick Villiers into marriage. And now that he was walking into the trap, and laughing at its boundaries, she felt uncomfortable?</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a dinner party,\u201d Jemma was saying. \u201cHe\u2019ll spring the question, of course, and it will be most amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he will.\u201d Jemma peered at her. \u201cYou do realize how much a painting by Reynolds costs, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Roberta looked again at the odd, cunning expression in the girl\u2019s eyes, the shadow cast by the mousetrap onto the soft muslin of the girl\u2019s dress and the cat\u2019s bright eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t think he guessed that I planned to set a trap for him?\u201d</p><p>Jemma shrugged. \u201cWho cares? Would you credit his earnestness if he had sent you a necklace of rubies?\u201d</p><p>Roberta nodded.</p><p>\u201cThis is better than a necklace. Even the frame is superb. Now who shall I invite to the dinner party? It has to be just the right mix to present the proper frame for Villiers\u2019s demise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemise\u201d?</p> <p>\u201cIt will seem so to the ton,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBelieve me. Ladies have set their caps at him for the past ten years, and you merely smiled at him and he surrendered. You, my dear, are about to become the toast of London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven given my father\u2019s presence?\u201d Roberta said faintly.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAnd Mrs. Grope. Do you know, Roberta, I\u2019m not sure that Mrs. Grope entirely shares your papa\u2019s enthusiasm for her future career as a notorious courtesan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my belief that she would like to marry him,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he understands that, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen never see things,\u201d Jemma said with a sigh. \u201cTheir marriage would cause a terrible scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of her loss of character?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cLook at Elizabeth Armistead, Fox\u2019s mistress. He openly professes his affection, and I\u2019m quite certain that he\u2019ll marry her at some point. The bets in White\u2019s have been running in her favor these four years. Even so, she is not received at or invited to most events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ton is a brutal barometer of acceptability, I assure you. I shall have to invite some respectable women to dinner, but I must speak to Beaumont first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the dinner?\u201d</p><p>Jemma seemed to have rethought whatever it was she was about to say, because she changed the subject entirely. \u201cA far more crucial problem,\u201d she said, \u201cis which mantuamaker should receive your patronage.\u201d</p><p>Roberta thought gratefully of the roll of banknotes her papa had given her. It made everything so much easier; she didn\u2019t feel like a horrid pauper, dressing in Jemma\u2019s clothing.</p><p>\u201cI would suggest that we use a Frenchwoman,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I am inherently prejudiced against my countrywomen. Well...perhaps I am.\u201d</p><p>Roberta burst out laughing, and in the ensuing delightful conversation, she quite forgot about the question of who was to be invited to the dinner party. \u201cI should like a balloon hat. Do you know them, Jemma?\u201d</p><p>Jemma nodded. \u201cIn Paris they are called lunardi. I\u2019m not sure whether it will suit you, dearest. All those feathers...so much trimming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw one in the park yesterday made of rose-colored French gauze with a wide brim,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cA young lady was wearing it quite low on one side, and high on the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThat does sound interesting. The one I have is all Italian tiffany pinned in loose puckers around the brim. I liked it very much, but then the wire poked out of the brim and stuck me in the ear one day and I never wore it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, the brim is wired,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cHow clever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll address the dinner party later,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI think we should go to Bond Street this very moment.\u201d</p><p>Jemma didn\u2019t think about the dinner party again until her husband appeared to play his part of the game with her. He moved as quickly as ever, knight to Queen\u2019s Bishop Three, but Jemma was aware of a slight feeling of unease. She took her time. Finally she moved a knight to King\u2019s Bishop Three.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d Elijah said, giving her move a lightning quick glance. She was learning a great deal about her husband from their game. He seemed to grasp the connotations of her moves in two seconds. In truth, the power of his mind was astonishing.</p><p>\u201cI thought to give a dinner party this week,\u201d she said, sitting back. He looked less tired today, although there was a deep-down exhaustion in his eyes that she found rather worrying.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had people to sup here since you left for Paris,\u201d he said. He appeared to have forgotten about the offensive presence of Mrs. Grope. \u201cFowle will be ecstatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we could come up with a guest list between the two of us,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cexcluding anyone who would make an issue of not attending due to the marquess\u2019s companion. Harriet will lend us consequence and she won\u2019t make a fuss. Who would you like to invite?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrom the House?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! That is, not unless the person was a particular friend of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d Beaumont said, almost as if he were testing the word on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of friends, or rather former friends,\u201d Jemma said, watching him, \u201cI shall invite Villiers, as he is courting Lady Roberta.\u201d</p> <p>Beaumont shrugged. His smile had a touch of wryness. \u201cA prevarication? My distinct impression is that he is courting my wife, if the word can be used so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost gentlemen are courting three or four people at the same time. Courting is merely an activity, like eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that the dish in question is you,\u201d he said. But he sounded weary, not really interested, and certainly not jealous.</p><p>\u201cSo we have the marquess and Mrs. Grope\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grope\u201d?</p> <p>Jemma smiled at his bark of laughter. \u201cDidn\u2019t Fowle mention her name? Roberta is not entirely certain that Mr. Grope ever existed. At any rate, we have eight of us, including Roberta, Damon and Villiers. It would be best if we added two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met someone interesting at your ball,\u201d Beaumont said. \u201cMiss Charlotte Tatlock.\u201d</p><p>Jemma frowned. \u201cOne of the daughters of Sir Patrick Tatlock? I have only the slimmest acquaintance with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed remarkably intelligent,\u201d he said, pushing himself up from the table.</p><p>\u201cAre there other persons whom you would like to see at the table? Caro shall make arrangements for me, Beaumont, but I assure you that I shall curb her imagination. She can play the pianoforte for us afterwards.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe devil with my reputation. If Pitt can\u2019t see that I\u2019m hardly in the debauched company of the Prince of Wales and his friends, then he can bar me his company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s no fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI go to meet him now,\u201d he said with a rueful smile, made his leg and departed.</p><p>Jemma went to her little writing desk. It was frustrating to realize that she was so far out of the current of English society that she didn\u2019t know instantly who would be so overcome by curiosity as to be unable to resist the idea of dining in company with Mrs. Grope. In the end, she invited Corbin. He would never chatter about the event, even if she placed him next to Mrs. Grope.</p><p>Her husband moved his chess pieces as if there were no other move than the one he had just thought of; Villiers was far more deliberative. Beaumont calculated in a heartbeat; Villiers brooded. As a player, he was very similar to her. He clearly spent a good deal of the day thinking of dazzling possibilities. He was a swashbuckling player, and she was something of the same. Elijah was some other kind of player: taut, deliberate, incredibly fast.</p><p>Brigitte brought in the Duke of Villiers\u2019s card. \u201cBut I must tell you, my lady, that Joseph accompanies his master. He just told me that he asked, but he thinks no one in the household knows of the affair with Lady Caroline, even the duke\u2019s valet. His Grace, the Duke of Villiers, plays it very quiet to the chest, he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to the chest,\u201d Jemma said absentmindedly. It made sense from what she knew of Villiers. He would never amiably discuss his affaires with a valet. \u201cThe \u00e9charpe cloak is yours, Brigitte. I do hope that your acquaintance with Joseph has not been too tedious.\u201d</p><p>Brigitte dimpled. \u201cHe has still to take me to these gardens. I am finding that red hair is perhaps not such a grave defect.\u201d</p><p>Villiers appeared wearing an extraordinary cloak embroidered in peacock feathers. Jemma eyed it and said nothing. He was flaunting something...what? His costume seemed almost a slap in the face to those who felt men should dress more soberly than did women.</p> <p>She took a pawn with her queen; he moved a knight to Queen\u2019s Bishop Three; they both settled back in their chairs.</p><p>\u201cHow was your morning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cTerrifyingly out of the mundane.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pensioned my mistress.\u201d</p><p>Jemma thought about that for a moment and decided that he wouldn\u2019t mind a frank question. \u201cHow much does it cost to do such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of balancing economics and affection,\u201d he said. \u201cI am fond of her, and more to the point, she lived in a house of mine for three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she distraught?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. It was all amicable, which told me that I should have done it a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it must be tiresome to be a man, when it comes to these matters,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAfter all, in the last three years you have had, one must presume, some little interludes with gentlewomen of the ton, and at the same time, your mistress was waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so old yet that you need question my prowess.\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly at that. \u201c\u2019Tis the emotions that would tire me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes it does feel a bit complicated. Sophia is a courtesan to be reckoned with, you see. She games, she kisses, she has many demands.\u201d</p><p>Jemma toyed with a chess piece. \u201cAnd thus you gave her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, I gave her up because I plan to marry.\u201d Villiers watched her closely to see whether she would show signs of jealousy.</p><p>She surprised him again, smiling at him with true appreciation in her eyes. \u201cThen you did just the right thing.\u201d</p><p>He gaped at her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel that a gentleman should no longer pay for women\u2019s company once he takes a wife,\u201d she said. \u201cI find the practice distasteful at the best of times, but dishonorable once vows are said.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed his astonishment. \u201cRather old-fashioned of you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, I think it is the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Hellfire Club, with all their f\u00eates and nymphs...they\u2019re dying, though they don\u2019t see it yet. France was the same. The Queen herself, Marie Antoinette, is turning to settled domesticity, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your husband\u2019s party will bring with them sober behavior and settled mores? Wives who play at dairy maids rather than flamboyant courtesans?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cMy husband and his set are as likely to have mistresses as men of other parties. They simply do not flaunt their affections, at least not as much as does Fox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFox\u2019s Elizabeth is a remarkable creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her in Paris and was most impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I thought I would join the settled ones by marrying your ward,\u201d he said, watching her through his eyelashes.</p><p>Her smile was disappointingly genuine. In fact, Villiers was aware of an interior whisper suggesting that his revenge didn\u2019t appear particularly effective. Jemma didn\u2019t seem to give a damn whether he married or no.</p><p>\u201cYou could not make a better choice. Roberta is remarkably beautiful, as you know, but she is also intelligent and witty. The only possible defect is that she doesn\u2019t play chess.\u201d Jemma made a funny face.</p><p>\u201cAh, but I have you for that,\u201d he said, touching one of her delicate fingers. It had come to him in the middle of the night that what he really wanted from this was not, in truth, the match itself. It was she. He wanted her, that deep intelligence, and the way she sparked into sudden laughter, the pure elegance of the way she moved and spoke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not to mention the fact that she was a brilliant chess player, a fact that fired him with a roaring lust, deep in his loins. In fact, the emotion was so ferocious that he didn\u2019t dare look at it too closely.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying this,\u201d he remarked, watching as she shook down her ruffs. \u201cWhich is a terrifying thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? I always enjoy well-played chess, even when I\u2019m losing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chess, certainly. But also\u201d\u2014he leaned forward\u2014\u201ctalking to you.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma hid a smile. Villiers was most seductive when he was the most straightforward, if only he knew it. She felt unshaken by his practiced raillery about her ruffs and her beauty: but when he grinned at her, and told her frankly about pensioning his mistress\u2014then, she was in danger.</p><p>Yet she had no intention of succumbing to Villiers\u2019s wiles. All the more so now that he was almost affianced to Roberta.</p><p>She met his eyes and saw disappointment flash.</p><p>\u201cYou unman me,\u201d he said gravely.</p><p>\u201cYou think me capable of such disloyalty to a friend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you think me foolish if you wish me to believe that you have no interest in me due to my possible marriage to your ward.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer that, and he felt a flash of anger at his own stupidity in declaring himself. Did he really want to marry? Of course, he would have no hesitation dropping the country miss as quickly as he picked her up.</p><p>Yet Roberta was exquisite. And capable of a witty rejoinder, which was rare. She was young, likely fertile, and all the rest of it. He needed an heir, for God\u2019s sake. Plus, his mistress was gone now. He needed a bedpartner.</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t have me?\u201d</p><p>Jemma smiled at him, and her beauty was almost like a blow in the face. \u201cYou\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lady may not have me.\u201d He knew that was a falsehood as well as Jemma did.</p> <p>It was damnably true that it is hard to desire a person who wants you. Roberta made no secret of her desire for him. Her eyes grew slightly dreamy at the very sight of him.</p><p>He preferred Jemma\u2019s clear-eyed look.</p><p>It was also bitterly true that a person who doesn\u2019t want you is twice as desirable.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>T he invitations were delivered by footmen.</p><p>\u201cI simply can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been invited!\u201d May said with a little gasp, looking at the card her sister held. \u201cDo you have some acquaintance with the duchess of which I knew nothing?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte shook her head. \u201cThe duke asked me to dance at the ball, but I never spoke to Her Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duke?\u201d May\u2019s round face look scandalized. \u201cWhy on earth would he invite you?\u201d She peered at the card. \u201cIt all looks most respectable, doesn\u2019t it? I would have expected her to announce a Feast of Venus, or some such thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt they would invite me if they wished for nymphs,\u201d Charlotte said dryly.</p><p>\u201cTrue. But how queer it is to invite you and not me. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s queer? You don\u2019t think that he\u2019s thinking of setting you up as\u2014as an intimate!\u201d Her voice was horrified.</p><p>Charlotte allowed herself just one longing thought about the duke\u2019s lovely, tired eyes before she said, \u201cDon\u2019t be a goose, May. Do I look like the sort of woman whom the duke would set up as his courtesan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least my life would be more interesting than it is now,\u201d Charlotte said, just to provoke her.</p><p>But May was not a bad sort, and having got over her first surprise at the invitation, was beginning to count its blessings. \u201cYou must have a new gown,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cWe\u2019ll send a message to Madame Hayes and tell her that we need that gown you ordered last month by Thursday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she will. She will once she hears that you are invited to this particular party,\u201d May cried. She was getting giddy with it now and waved the invitation over her head like a flag. \u201cPerhaps Town and Country will produce sketches of every person invited; they might well. How exciting it all is!\u201d</p><p>And Charlotte had to admit that it was exciting.</p><p>She kept her own preparations for the event secret from her sister; she sent a footman out to buy every political newspaper and commentary he could find.</p><p>The Duchess of Berrow\u2019s response to the invitation was rather less celebratory. With a sigh she changed her gown, had horses put to the carriage and set out for town. A mere hour or two later the butler ushered Jemma into the drawing room where Harriet waited for her.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cyou\u2019re just in time. I\u2019ve decided to catalog all the paintings of Judith and Holofernes in the house and I would adore some help.\u201d</p><p>Harriet rose to her feet. As always, the force of Jemma\u2019s personality made her feel like a faded cutout, a cartoon from the illustrated papers. \u201cI came to ask about this,\u201d she said, taking out her invitation.</p><p>Jemma grinned at her, leaned closer and said in a conspiratorial whisper, \u201cOur plans are in full force!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chess game? Are you winning?\u201d Harriet asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI have every expectation,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIn fact, though it\u2019s vain of me to say so, I would bet on myself. Despair is circling Villiers on all sides. He\u2019s going to ask for Lady Roberta\u2019s hand in marriage at this very dinner party.\u201d</p><p>Harriet\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cVilliers? Getting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of a better revenge, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014But\u2014are you saying that you don\u2019t like your ward?\u201d Harriet asked, bewildered. \u201cI thought she was a lovely person, whom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she is,\u201d Jemma interrupted. \u201cIn fact, Villiers is extremely lucky to have her. No, it\u2019s marriage itself that is a punishment. He has no understanding of the state, you know. He thinks his life will hardly change: I can see that in his eyes. He\u2019s a babe in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone\u2019s marriage is unpleasant,\u201d Harriet ventured.</p><p>\u201cYou think that I should not extend the example of my marriage to all such unions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, look at your marriage,\u201d Jemma suggested. \u201cIt was the best of matches; you both had great love for each other.\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Harriet asked dangerously. It was one thing if she bemoaned the rift between herself and Benjamin, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cWere there not great moments of humiliation?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>Humiliating moments raced through Harriet\u2019s mind in an exhausting stream. \u201cYes,\u201d she said faintly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of marriage. Inherent to the state of matrimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Villiers will be at this dinner party,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cAnd I\u2014I am to be there too? I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must,\u201d Jemma said, taking her arm and walking into the entryway. \u201cNow we are going to walk through this entire house and spy out all the paintings of Judith. Fowle, will you follow us and note down the pieces?\u201d</p><p>Harriet tried to swallow her frustration. \u201cJemma,\u201d she hissed, \u201cmust your butler follow us? I just told you that I am not going to attend your dinner party.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d Jemma said, smiling down at her. \u201cI need you.

Oh look, there\u2019s a painting of Judith in the corridor. I hadn\u2019t even seen it before. Fowle, did you mark this one down?\u201d</p><p>Harriet glanced back and saw the butler making a notation on a piece of foolscap.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is your brother doing?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMaking an ass of himself, as I said,\u201d Jemma replied, in a perfectly normal tone of voice. \u201cMooning over Roberta, if the truth be known. In fact, from the look in his eyes, he\u2019s halfway to thinking he\u2019s passionately in love. And I can\u2019t have that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Roberta must marry Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if she\u2019s marrying Villiers\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one in their right mind would marry Villiers if Damon entered the lists,\u201d Jemma said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYou are his sister,\u201d Harriet pointed out, feeling a bit like laughing for the first time all day. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you might overestimate Damon\u2019s good parts just slightly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s an impartial judgment. Roberta doesn\u2019t play chess, so Villiers\u2019s talent is of no attraction. In fact, I\u2019m not quite sure what she does find so attractive in him. But I also know that Damon is kissing her in the odd moment here or there, and I certainly don\u2019t want him to muddle Villiers\u2019s proposal, or Roberta\u2019s thinking about it. So you must dance attendance on him, Harriet. I am counting on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to be in the same room with Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put you at opposite ends of the table,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cAh, here\u2019s another. Particularly bloodthirsty, isn\u2019t it? And she put it in the morning room, in the place of honor.\u201d</p><p>They both gazed for a moment at the triumphant Judith, holding up a head. The artist appeared to have given special attention to the neck of poor Holofernes. Jemma shuddered a little. \u201cI shall never understand the dowager duchess: never.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen did Beaumont\u2019s father die?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cI believe he was ten years old. Perhaps nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he essentially grew up with his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat fact would go far to making me feel sorry for him,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut of course there\u2019s no such emotion between man and wife.\u201d</p><p>She turned away. \u201cThere\u2019s another one in the ladies\u2019 retiring room. It gave poor Lady Fibble quite a shock during our ball, or so she told me. Apparently she thought that it resembled Beaumont. I devoutly hope that is not the case. Or if it is, I assume that the portrait is of the late duke.\u201d</p><p>It was Harriet\u2019s turn to shudder.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>April 17</p> <p>Day six of the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>C harlotte could tell before she put her slipper from the carriage that Beaumont House was surrounded by throngs of people waiting to see who would enter. She took a deep breath. She was not used to traveling among the very highest circles of the ton. She and May were girls grown long in the tooth, hanging on the fringes with their inadequate dowries and lack of powerful friends. They were well bred, so were invited everywhere. But they didn\u2019t stand out. They never took.</p><p>Except, Charlotte reminded herself again, that May had now been taken by Mr. Muddle, and next year Charlotte would be doing the season on her own. It was all so dismaying that one couldn\u2019t think about it too clearly. It was like thinking about turned seams and orphaned children.</p><p>She gave herself a little shake. She looked her very best. Charlotte knew exactly what that meant: not like a ravishing goddess, but like the profile on a Roman coin. May always said her nose was refined. It was a nice shape, but far too long. \u201cIt makes you look intelligent,\u201d Mama had said. \u201cNo man wants an insipid miss for a wife.\u201d</p><p>It seemed they didn\u2019t want a Roman coin either.</p><p>The crowd around the carriage pushed and juggled as she stepped from the carriage. Most of them were trying to figure out who she was.</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t Lady Sarah,\u201d she heard someone say. \u201cLady Sarah doesn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was sure that Lady Sarah didn\u2019t have a Roman nose. She pulled herself taller. Her gown was of pale pink cr\u00eape and showed off her skin and her dark blue eyes. Her hair was perfectly groomed, and as high as fashion demanded. She was the very best she could be, and that had to be enough.</p><p>\u201cI got it\u2014Tatlock,\u201d she heard someone say loudly, just as she began to climb the stairs to the front door. The butler bowed so low that she almost expected him to topple over.</p><p>\u201cMiss Charlotte Tatlock,\u201d he said, backing away. The house was surprisingly quiet. \u201cIf you please,\u201d the butler said, after her wrap had been removed, \u201cwould you prefer to visit a retiring room, or would you like to join the other guests in the drawing room?\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was, frankly, too frightened to gaze at herself again. It was best to get it over with. Surely the dinner would be large, and there would be people she knew. She could find a comforting matron and stay in her shadow.</p><p>But it was not a large party, and there was no comforting matron to be seen. Instead there was just a small cluster of people standing about holding glasses.</p><p>Charlotte almost ran, but the Duke of Beaumont turned, and smiled.</p><p>She walked forward.</p><p>One moment Roberta was chatting with Mrs. Grope about the feathers she had bought at the bazaar, and the next Villiers had swept her away to the far side of the room.</p><p>\u201cSurely one might keep a polite distance from women of her caliber?\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI realize it is difficult under the circumstances.\u201d And then, without pause: \u201cI\u2019ve never asked anyone to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Unless Roberta was mistaken, the Duke of Villiers was about to ask her to marry him. Was doing it at this very moment, as a matter of fact. She had an unnerving sense of watching a play rather than performing in it. \u201cI trust that new experiences are not always unpleasant ones,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am surprised by my own pleasure in it.\u201d</p><p>It flashed into her mind that he seemed remarkably unconcerned by the question of her pleasure, but it was a disloyal thought, so she put an expression of pleased acceptance on her face.</p><p>Somewhat to her surprise, he did it properly. In one smooth movement, Villiers dropped to his right knee, took her hand and said, \u201cWill you do me the great honor of becoming my duchess, Lady Roberta?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed nervously and said, \u201cYes,\u201d and that was that.</p><p>He kissed her hand afterwards.</p><p>Of course it wasn\u2019t a kiss like one of Damon\u2019s wicked kisses. It was a perfectly respectable brush of his lips.</p><p>She shivered, and there was a ghost of a smile on his lips that made her feel a little vexed. The smile seemed to imply that young women always shivered when he kissed them.</p><p>\u201cI asked your father for his permission this afternoon,\u201d he said, rising to his feet with the lithe beauty of a large cat, like a tiger.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Roberta said, wondering how her father had managed to keep that a secret from her.</p><p>\u201cI requested that he not inform you,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAlthough you can hardly have had doubts about my intentions.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you for the painting of the mousetrap,\u201d she said. And then added hastily: \u201cThat is, the picture of the mouse\u2014the picture of the girl, holding the mousetrap!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWasn\u2019t it a marvelous vignette, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come now. I know you already to be a creature of wit to match your beauty. Surely you have more to say than \u2018Yes, indeed\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Roberta swallowed a flash of annoyance. \u201cI gather you would like me to comment on your metaphor? I found it interesting that the mousetrap contained a mouse. In fact, given the presence of a very interested looking cat in the corner of the painting, one could say that she was saving the poor wee mouse from being eaten.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her and that smile fired desire in her heart again, for the man she\u2019d glimpsed in the inn, for the deep weight of his silver coat, the reserve in his eyes, the sense\u2014</p><p>She realized suddenly that she had never imagined him as domesticated. As truly married to her. She thought of him as a wild animal whom she planned to trap. And by walking straight to her hand, he seemed more docile and less\u2014less wild somehow.</p><p>Perhaps she wanted the feral cat, and not the neat little mouse, sitting in a cage.</p><p>\u201cSo you are rescuing me, are you?\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cAnd what would the cat represent, do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAge, perhaps,\u201d she said, giving in to a wish to make him sorry for making her feel young and stupid.</p><p>\u201cAlas, age is a predator from which none of us escape.\u201d</p><p>But she knew herself to be young and he at least ten years older, and so she merely turned her head, as if it would be petty to respond. \u2019Twas impolite, but he made no comment.</p><p>It was better, she told herself, that he learn not to condescend to her. She was aware of a shocking urge to be rude to him, which was not proper behavior for a woman who has just accepted a gentleman\u2019s hand in marriage.</p><p>On that thought she smiled up at him, as if he were a knight come to rescue her from a dour dragon. There was an answering spark in his eyes. As if he realized that she held the trap in her hand, and only she could operate the latch.</p><p>She gave him another melting smile. There was more than one way to bait a trap, after all.</p> <p>Chapter 24</p><p>D amon was well aware that he was consumed by lust. It was a dangerous state. He\u2019d never before experienced it as a sort of waking fever dream, as the past few days when he walked the halls of Beaumont House merely so that he could catch a whiff of Roberta\u2019s perfume, or see the flutter of her dress retreat around a corner.</p><p>Of course she was a devil of a woman, and had gotten herself engaged to Villiers, for God\u2019s sake. He\u2019d been talking to the Duchess of Berrow when Villiers pulled Roberta to the side of the room and dropped on one knee. There, in front of all of them, although no one seemed to notice except himself and Harriet, who\u2019d fussed at him until he stopped staring and escorted her to a chair.</p><p>It was typical of Villiers. He had no need, apparently, no wish to make his marital arrangements in private.</p><p>It was the first time in Damon\u2019s life that he had ever felt homicidal. And yet it wasn\u2019t Villiers whose life trembled in the balance. It was hers. He had to have her. And yet...</p><p>Her eyes glowed as she smiled up at Villiers, that rou\u00e9 who would doubtless give her disease, and surely despair. She had ignored his bastards, the mistress he flaunted at the opera, the meaningless liaisons in which he had so freely engaged. There was something about him that had shattered her brain.</p><p>And that\u2014that\u2014made Damon feel deranged.</p><p>He\u2019d never felt this emotion for a woman. He wasn\u2019t that sort of man. He had a clear sense of himself. He loved Teddy more than was seemly; he knew that. He should leave Teddy to the care of servants, and he couldn\u2019t seem to do so, and yet he was probably ruining his son in the process.</p> <p>A child is like a good horse, he told himself. You should always leave a horse to be broken by a stable master. And yet somehow that was just what he was afraid of\u2014that a nursemaid would break Teddy\u2019s spirit behind his back, when he wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>But to return to the subject: he was a decent enough fellow. He\u2019d never killed anyone in a duel, though he\u2019d had reason and opportunity. He had far more money than people thought, given that Jemma played games of strategy on a board and he preferred to move his Bills of Exchange and Bills of Goods through the markets, as adroitly as any rook.</p><p>So why was he maddened\u2014absolutely maddened\u2014by the fact that a young woman had fallen in love and promised to marry another? Roberta thought he was all light and laughter, with no dark streak. She had no idea how furious she made him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t his. She belonged to Villiers, and that was all there was to it. The fact that the very sound of Villiers\u2019s name made his stomach roil, made him think of the exquisite weight of a fencing steel...that was beside the point. If Roberta wanted Villiers, and not him, there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>He had lost.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had suddenly realized that Roberta was the first thing in his life that he had ever truly wanted.</p><p>He would simply have to get used to it. Likely he only wanted her because she didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>Like a magnet to the true north, he strolled toward her and Villiers. \u201cI believe congratulations are in order,\u201d he said, making a leg to the duke.</p><p>\u201cThe honor is all mine,\u201d Villiers responded, languid as always.</p><p>The butler announced the arrival of a young lady, Miss Charlotte Tatlock. Villiers glanced over his shoulder. \u201cOne must suppose Her Grace has marked this young lady for your companionship, Gryffyn.\u201d He said it politely enough, but Damon could see the No Poaching signs going up. Roberta belonged to Villiers now.</p><p>Damon walked off with a bright smile and a discovery.</p><p>The moment he knew of Teddy\u2019s existence, he understood that his life was about to change. The fact that Teddy\u2019s mother wanted nothing to do with her child did not particularly influence his decision. Teddy was his.</p><p>He just discovered a great, second truth.</p><p>Villiers could post all the signs he wished, but Damon was going to take exactly what he wanted.</p><p>Roberta.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give a damn what she thought about it, or what Villiers thought about it. She was wrong.</p><p>She was his.</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>C harlotte found herself seated at the right hand of her host, which was a signal honor. The duchess had placed Lady Roberta at the other end of the table in celebration of her engagement to the Duke of Villiers, between her future husband and her father, the Marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury. On Charlotte\u2019s right was a gentleman named Lord Corbin. Across from her was another duchess, whose name Charlotte didn\u2019t quite catch. Berrow, perhaps? But she wasn\u2019t at all terrifying for someone so noble. In fact, she reminded Charlotte of a nice moorhen, although perhaps she was more of a mourning dove, dressed in soft gray. She smiled at Charlotte very kindly, though she said nothing to her directly.</p><p>In truth, the group was so small that conversations flared everywhere, in disregard of all the rules she had learned regarding proper etiquette at the dining table.</p><p>Her end of the table was quickly embroiled in a political battle. May had begged her to stay away from politics, but it wasn\u2019t her fault. No sooner had she sat down than the duke informed the Earl of Gryffyn, the duchess\u2019s brother, that she was one of his staunchest opponents. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And then, when she turned red with embarrassment and started to explain herself, the earl just laughed and started to egg her on. \u201cI\u2019m a great supporter of Fox,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I like the Prince of Wales. What\u2019s not to like in a man who boasts of eating twenty-four hens\u2019 eggs at one sitting? If I haven\u2019t taken my seat in the House, it\u2019s only because I\u2019d hate to rub my brother-in-law\u2019s nose in his own foolishness.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go along with that, so she switched sides and defended the duke\u2019s recent speech to the House about the lunacy of providing the Prince with an allowance of 100,000 pounds per year. But when the duke\u2019s eyes lit up, she felt it only fair to point out the reverse as well, that as the Duke of Cornwall, the Prince was entitled to duchy revenues as well as money from the Civil List.</p><p>The duke groaned. The Duchess of Berrow changed the subject with a comment about the need for parliamentary reforms in Ireland, and before she knew it, the meal flew by.</p><p>The other end of the table was having a far more sedate conversation. Most of the time the marquess seemed to be reciting poetry. The verses sounded rather awful, but then they all started quoting snippets of verse at each other. She happened to meet the duke\u2019s eyes during a pause in their conversation and saw perfect comprehension there.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t read a book of poetry in years,\u201d he said, leaning over to her.</p><p>\u201cWe ought to have,\u201d she said, feeling laughter bubbling up at the pure pleasure of it. \u201cWe are very ill-prepared for a cultural conversation. Not even Thomas Gray, Your Grace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even!\u201d he said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cO ye pens and O ye pencils,\u201d declaimed the marquess from the other end of the table, \u201cAnd all ye scribbling utensils, say in what words and in what meter, shall unfeigned admiration greet her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can deduce that was a couplet,\u201d the duke said, his eyes dancing. He was so beautiful, Charlotte thought dimly. And so brilliant.</p> <p>His duchess was apparently enjoying this poetry; she was clapping her hands.</p><p>\u201cI just figured out that it rhymes,\u201d the duke said to her. \u201cIn what meter and greet her.\u201d His raised eyebrow was enough to send her into a storm of giggles. Luckily, Lord Corbin intervened to ask about William Whitehead, who was the current Poet Laureate but had refused to write poetry that conformed to government policy.</p><p>She turned away from the duke with a palpable pang. This will never do, she told herself. He\u2019s married and he\u2019s a duke. You\u2019re nothing more than an old maid, for all you somehow found yourself at this party. But she knew...</p><p>She knew how she found herself at the party.</p><p>Beaumont had asked to have her. The fact was like a warm blanket on a chilly night. For the first time in her life, a man was claiming her presence.</p><p>He was married, that was true.</p> <p>His wife was one of the most beautiful women in Europe\u2014and yet he had asked her to supper.</p><p>The duchess doesn\u2019t understand the political life, Charlotte told herself.</p><p>She liked paltry poetry, with terrible rhymes.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t understand him.</p><p>On the other end of the table, the Marquess of Wharton and Malmesbury was enjoying himself just as much as was Charlotte, though for rather different reasons. For one thing, he had his beloved daughter to his right, and his beloved Mrs. Grope to his left. He knew himself to be a rather simple man, at heart. He expressed himself in dense rhyme and eloquent meter...but inside he knew that the subjects of his poetry sprang from his heart. His daughter, his beloved, his cat, cream pastries now and then.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t in his nature to keep emotions to himself. \u201cI am not sure that I am ready to give you up,\u201d he told Roberta. She was so terrifyingly beautiful, this daughter of his: far more Margaret\u2019s than his, and yet poor Margaret had not lived to see her grow to the blossom of her womanhood. \u201cWhen you were a baby, I wrote an ode to the fold of your eyelid. What will I do without your eyelids to look at every day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Papa,\u201d she said, looking fussed, as she always did when he praised her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see what I mean when you have a child of your own,\u201d he told her. Now he saw, of course, that he couldn\u2019t have kept her in the country forever. How could he think to deny his darling girl the pleasure of having her own children? Still...he looked across the table at her chosen husband. A duke. One could hardly complain about that. And yet there was something old and degenerate about Villiers, something of a tired soul, that the marquess did not like. He couldn\u2019t imagine how to say it to Roberta.</p> <p>If only Margaret had lived. Mrs. Grope, much though he loved her flamboyant ways, had none of Margaret\u2019s subtlety. And she wasn\u2019t Roberta\u2019s mother either. In fact...</p><p>\u201cShould I have raised you in a different way?\u201d he asked, struck to the heart by sudden anguish. Mrs. Grope looked rather garish beside the ladies at the table. Lord Corbin was kindly speaking to her about the stage, and she looked like a bedazzling peacock in comparison to his sober attire.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Papa?\u201d Roberta asked.</p><p>\u201cShould I have spared you the company of Mrs. Grope?\u201d he whispered hoarsely. \u201cOr Selina, darling Selina?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him over a forkful of green beans. \u201cPapa, do you mean to say that you are having a change of heart about your household arrangements, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not now?\u201d he enquired.</p><p>\u201cBecause I am twenty-one! Perhaps you should have had these qualms when I was fourteen and Selina waved goodbye to her traveling group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in love,\u201d he said, shamefaced. \u201cYour mother had been gone for two years, and I fell in love.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a little at that, and his heart lightened. \u201cI know you did, Papa. I know you were in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he continued in a low voice, \u201cit isn\u2019t because of that, because of my lack of convention that you\u2019ve chosen Villiers, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Papa,\u201d she said. But she didn\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>Villiers might be a perfectly acceptable man in his own way. But he wasn\u2019t the one for Roberta. He was a cold-blooded man.</p><p>\u201cIf you change your mind about this marriage,\u201d he said, \u201cthere will be many other men eager to marry you, Roberta. You\u2019re barely been in London a week. Just think who you might meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa!\u201d she squealed, with a glance to her right. \u201cDon\u2019t say such things. I shan\u2019t change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you quite certain of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>The marquess tried to imagine himself stopping by for a friendly supper with his daughter once she was the Duchess of Villiers and he knew without a second thought that it would never happen. Villiers was a man of rigid propriety. He would never invite an aging and foolish marquess to his house, except for those occasions on which relatives could not be excluded. Christmas, perhaps.</p><p>He felt a tear roll down his cheek. It was bad enough when he lost Margaret, but he had had his delightful scrap of a daughter to tell him that his poetry was terrible, just as her mother used to do. Without Roberta...</p><p>Another tear followed the first. Roberta\u2019s hand crept into his. \u201cPapa, I promise to visit you,\u201d she said, so sweetly that he could hardly bear it. \u201cI can\u2019t stay at home forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean you to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet I have made so many mistakes! So many mistakes!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly he realized that all conversation around them had ceased. There was a look in the Duke of Villiers\u2019s eyes that suggested he wouldn\u2019t even be invited for Christmas dinner. Mrs. Grope, bless her heart, was eating her peas with her knife. Perhaps he should have...</p><p>\u201cIt must be so hard to say goodbye to a child,\u201d the Duchess of Beaumont said kindly. \u201cI can imagine how painful it must be.\u201d</p><p>The marquess cast a guilty look at Roberta. She hated it when he made a scene, and sure enough, she was staring down at her lap. Hastily, he dashed away his tears. \u201cWhen I think of all the unfeeling things Roberta has said about my poetry, my heart lightens,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you remember, child, when I read you my masterpiece, virtually my only published masterpiece, and you said it was twaddle?\u201d</p> <p>To his sorrow, Roberta looked even more downcast. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Papa,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was twaddle!\u201d he said gaily. \u201cUtter twaddle! I read it over the other day and realized what a mistake it had been. I tried an experiment,\u201d he told the unexpressive, uninterested face of Villiers. \u201cTo write an entire sonnet, fourteen lines, with one rhyme only. Of course, Shakespeare had a scheme worked out that allowed him seven rhymes. The great Petrarchan sonneteers sometimes made do with fewer. But I think I am the only English poet to write a sonnet with one rhyme!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your rhyme?\u201d the Duchess of Beaumont asked.</p><p>\u201cI had to choose a rhyme with many variants,\u201d he said, \u201cso I settled on bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a nature poem,\u201d Villiers said, boredom dripping from his voice. \u201cI would guess that the bear went to its lair.\u201d</p> <p>The marquess reminded himself that he was a grown man, and fools have always made fun of literature. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d he said with dignity. \u201cThere are many useful rhymes, such as fair, mare, and pear.\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked to his left, at Roberta. \u201cBut your daughter thought the poem was rubbish, did she? How extremely unkind of her.\u201d</p><p>His comment spoke volumes, to the marquess\u2019s mind. This man would never be able to understand a line of poetry. It wasn\u2019t that he wanted a poet for a son-in-law, but:</p><p>\u201cA man who doesn\u2019t understand poetry, cannot live poetry,\u201d he stated, hoping Roberta would understand him.</p><p>\u201cLiving poetry has never been an active pursuit of mine,\u201d Villiers responded promptly.</p><p>Roberta cleared her throat. The marquess remembered how much she hated philosophical statements. The last thing he wanted to do was embarrass her on such a special evening. His heart dropped again.</p> <p>\u201cMy father was speaking metaphorically,\u201d she said to Villiers.</p><p>\u201cI know of metaphors,\u201d Villiers said, glancing at Roberta with an indifference that shocked her father to the bone. \u201cBut I fail to understand the concept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to think of it as a person who lives in contact with great minds,\u201d she said to him and, gentle though her voice was, there was a sting in it. \u201cPerhaps there were great chess players of the past, but they have left no record. There have been great poets, and we are able to enjoy their thoughts still.\u201d</p><p>The marquess sat, frozen. Roberta had defended him! Her father\u2019s chest hurt from the joy of it.</p><p>Villiers took a bite of chicken, presumably because he was so floored by his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s brilliant riposte that he could think of nothing to say.</p><p>The duchess said in a very soothing way, \u201cWho is your favorite poet, Lord Wharton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare,\u201d he said. \u201cI am pedestrian in my admiration for the man, but to live in Shakespeare\u2019s words, to walk in his steps, gives me reason to continue.\u201d He caught sight of Mrs. Grope\u2019s plumage wagging at his shoulder and added hastily, \u201cAlong with my deep devotion to Mrs. Grope, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Villiers agreed. There was something very unpleasant about his tone. The marquess didn\u2019t dare look at his poor daughter. Though he had been a terrible papa, and embarrassed her time and again, she still loathed it when people made fun of him.</p> <p>So this time he took her hand. Because though he\u2019d told her many a time that laughter didn\u2019t hurt him, he knew she didn\u2019t really believe him.</p><p>The sad thing was that she had never grasped the truly important thing: laughter can\u2019t hurt someone, but cold indifference can.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>T he Duke of Villiers had made up his mind. While it would be acceptable to marry Roberta, he may have made a wee error. In truth, he\u2019d be just as happy not to marry the lady. He certainly would rather not have her father as an intimate. His engagement didn\u2019t seem to have made a damn bit of difference to Jemma. In short, he may have made a mistake.</p><p>It was unfortunate that he came to his conclusion approximately two hours after issuing a formal proposal. But it was the work of a moment to launch a stratagem that would change the complexion of the board as it was laid out before him.</p><p>Unless he missed his bet, his old friend Elijah was flirting with a new piece, a pawn, a pawn, a veritable pawn and yet...who was he not to admit that pawns could be deliciously useful in their own way?</p><p>He would send Elijah\u2019s queen careening toward the opposite side of the board. He would then sacrifice his own queen...it was all in the nature of the game.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to accompany me to the library?\u201d he asked his fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>Roberta came to her feet with a pretty show of grace. She was an elegant young woman, he had to admit. They walked to the library.</p><p>\u201cI merely wanted to make certain that we were in agreement about certain aspects of our marriage,\u201d he said, helping her to a brocaded couch.</p><p>\u201cI am all attention,\u201d she said.</p><p>He blinked. In another woman, the comment might have an unpleasantly satirical edge, but she was smiling at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a simple thing,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving to do with those unpleasant bits of law called torts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreach of contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you are not planning to break our engagement?\u201d She asked it with perfect courtesy, but her eyes narrowed. Perhaps this marriage would have been the making of him. Yet it would be better to let it go.</p><p>\u201cI would never break our engagement,\u201d he said. Such an action would be rash and clumsy, opening him up to attack by pieces not yet in play, such as solicitors. Yet it should be a matter of no particular difficulty to cause the lady to withdraw from it herself. That was the nature of a brilliant game...to put forward one\u2019s pieces and see what came of them.</p><p>\u201cThe particular breach I was thinking of comes after marriage,\u201d he said, \u201cand has to do with spurious issue versus lawful issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard children,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cI would prefer\u2014nay, I must insist\u2014that you have none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no plans to do so.\u201d She was silent for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI trust this was not too unromantic?\u201d Villiers enquired.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, Your Grace, it shows a decidedly unromantic lack of faith in my character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant no imputation about your character. Did you think that we would have some sort of conventional union, like a pair of bakers who fall in love over a floury board and swear never to part?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Roberta forced herself to sit for a second and collect her thoughts. Her future husband clearly loved the subtleties of rhetoric and law. \u201cWill you do me the same honor?\u201d She raised her head and looked straight into his eyes. \u201cMy understanding is that you have spurious issue with several women. Are you intending to create more of these children after our marriage is celebrated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me to start giving a damn what the world thinks, I won\u2019t and I can\u2019t. I never have.\u201d</p><p>Roberta took a deep breath. \u201cI am asking you to be faithful to me,\u201d she said clearly.</p> <p>Villiers was silent. She watched the dark shadow of his eyelashes, his swarthy, almost harsh features. \u201cFaithfulness has always struck me as an unreasonable concept,\u201d he said, finally. \u201cI would greatly prefer if you were faithful until we raised a brat or two for the estate. It seems unreasonable to give another man\u2019s son my grandfather\u2019s land. But a clever woman can always prevent conception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd after that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would give you precisely the same freedom I would take for myself. I would do you the great honor of swearing\u2014on my honor\u2014that I will never fall in love with a woman. That any attachments would be a matter of impulse and pleasure, never of true intimacy.\u201d</p><p>She could hardly understand what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cYou, of course, would need no excuse other than les caprices de jolie femme, a beautiful woman\u2019s right to commit a folly,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>She looked directly at him. \u201cWon\u2019t you be enough to captivate my follies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI much doubt it.\u201d</p><p>This was a level of emotionless control that was indeed the opposite of her father\u2019s blatant adorations. She drank in the devil\u2019s slant of his eyes, the weary wrinkles at the edge of them, his palpable lack of interest. Her heart beat quickly. \u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His voice lashed her. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you look at the Earl of Gryffyn with a giddy sort of pleasure that belies your words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d she caught herself. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. Child\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d he said, sounding bored. \u201cI would certainly have to reach some sort of second infancy to contemplate a liaison with Gryffyn myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do not contemplate a liaison! I would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>He raised a beringed hand, and the words died in her throat. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, play me no scenes. I don\u2019t give a damn about the purity of your body or your soul. I would advise you, though, to act with a queen\u2019s munificence toward those for whom you feel desire. Any other circumstance is likely to breed resentment. And resentful wives are so very tiresome, to themselves and others.\u201d</p><p>She barely suppressed her shock.</p><p>His eyes laughed at her. \u201cShaken, country mouse? It must be the poet\u2019s soul you inherited from your father.\u201d</p><p>That stung her. \u201cMy father does not belong in this conversation.\u201d It made her feel almost queer, to realize how much her father would dislike the whole topic. How much he would loathe Villiers, if he heard his concept of marriage.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet your father has such a fascinating liberal attitude toward pleasure, given his attachment to the estimable Mrs. Grope.\u201d</p><p>It gave him obvious pleasure to utter Mrs. Grope\u2019s name; Roberta felt a flash of bitter resentment. It was so easy to make mockery of Mrs. Grope, so difficult to see what a true and loving relationship her papa and his courtesan shared.</p><p>\u201cI would that Papa would marry Mrs. Grope,\u201d she said, keeping her voice steady with an effort.</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at her anymore. In one clean movement, he pulled a long shining rapier from the interior of his polished cane.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cSword stick. Beautiful, isn\u2019t it? I had it made for me by Parisians; they understand duels in a way that no Englishman can hope to do. You see how I favor you as my future wife. You are the only person in England who knows the secret of this cane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will forgive me,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cif I reveal that knowing the secret of your cane is hardly an intimacy to which I aspire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do like you,\u201d he said, grinning at her. \u201cI never expected that in a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that Papa won\u2019t marry Mrs. Grope?\u201d Roberta said, ignoring what felt like a very thin compliment.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t marry the women we screw,\u201d he said, running his sword across the red velvet of the sofa cushion, to polish it, she had to suppose. \u201cYou surely have noticed that I have not made any movements toward your bed, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She felt giddy. Was she supposed to be honored? \u201cBecause...Because I am not a woman to screw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot by your husband. And please do not think you must share with me the history of pleasure harvested by others.\u201d He flipped the sword and ran it swiftly against the cushion again.</p><p>He must have tilted the edge a trifle too much because a gash followed the cut of his blade, widened, gave birth in an instant to a cloud of floating feathers. He swore.</p><p>\u201cI wish to understand precisely what you are saying,\u201d Roberta said in a small, wooden voice. \u201cDo I understand you to mean that my chastity\u2014or lack thereof\u2014is of no interest to you?\u201d</p><p>He tossed the gaping pillow to the side. A bridge of feathers briefly shaped themselves in the air before falling to the floor, to the couch, and a single feather, to his hair. \u201cYou seem to think that chastity adds to your attractions. I assure you that your beauty needs no such ornament. Of course, until we decide to create an heir, I shall expect you to behave in an entirely circumspect manner, using precautions, as I noted before. But I would never have offered for you, Roberta, were I not well aware that you are a woman of honor. Women of honor do not offer their husbands a cuckoo.\u201d</p><p>It seemed that honor\u2014to Villiers\u2014had everything to do with children, and nothing to do with virtue.</p><p>\u201cYou must be sensible, of course,\u201d he continued. \u201cCuckold is such an ugly word, even in this easy day and age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you are telling me to cuckold you,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cCuckolds are men who are too stupid to realize that their wives will stray,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not so foolish. Cuckolds are men whose wives make a jest of them by displaying their affections around the town. If I understand your character correctly, Roberta, you will never flaunt your affections.\u201d</p><p>She sat silent, knowing he was absolutely right, knowing that he had picked her as nimbly as she had picked him\u2014and, it seemed, for some of the same reasons.</p><p>\u201cI have fought several duels, though never over a woman\u2019s honor. It would be a grave disappointment to both of us if I had to defend your honor, Roberta, since I am generous enough to put it into your own keeping. I trust that you are no sprig from your father\u2019s tree. Do not cuckold me, and I will not confine you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should dislike confinement,\u201d she said. Suddenly she couldn\u2019t bear another minute of his emotionless drawl. She rose, as did he. He towered above her, exquisite and controlled as the day she met him, but in truth so much more complex, scornful and erotic than she had understood. She felt young and inestimably stupid. She, who thought that life with Papa and Mrs. Grope had taught her everything there was to know about men and women. She knew nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her father bellowed and shouted and uttered his ridiculous poetry.

To discuss unfaithfulness as if it were no more than a moment\u2019s impulse.</p><p>Her Papa, her foolish, foolish, Papa, loved Mrs. Grope, with all her terrible headdresses, and her grandiose ambitions to go back on the stage. Papa was the opposite of her husband-to-be. Which was just what she wanted, of course.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, sweeping her future husband a deep curtsy.</p><p>He was so beautiful, complex and devilish, that her heart reeled slightly watching him bow. And yet...</p> <p>And yet.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>T he windows in the small back ballroom were open to the night air. Lilacs were flowering in the gardens, somewhere in the dark, and their perfume was intoxicatingly sweet.</p><p>Caro had decorated the room with lemon trees incongruously hung with crystal pendants. Now she sat at the pianoforte. Damon hoped he was the only one who realized that the dangerous sparkle in the secretary\u2019s eye had resulted in bawdy French tavern songs, translated into great sweeping dance measures. Damon danced with Miss Tatlock, and then with Harriet. He danced again with Harriet, because she was at his elbow and he couldn\u2019t say no. He talked to his sister. He talked to his brother-in-law.</p><p>Meanwhile he watched for Roberta. Where the devil had Villiers taken her? If he touched her...</p> <p>She walked back into the room with a little wicked smile on her lips and his heart sank to his toes. He felt like vomiting.</p><p>He decided to leave, and then realized that his shoes were nailed to the floor. Villiers followed Roberta, but veered away to talk to Jemma.</p><p>\u201cNot even one dance?\u201d he heard Jemma say. \u201cOh, come, Villiers\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then Villiers drew Jemma\u2019s hands, both of them, up to his mouth and said something. About chess, no doubt, because a moment later they were tucked in front of a little table in the corner.</p><p>So much for dancing.</p><p>Roberta\u2019s eyes were glittering a bit too fiercely.</p> <p>\u201cCuz!\u201d he said to her. \u201cI gather dancing has gone by the wayside, since Jemma is involved in a game of chess.\u201d</p><p>Roberta didn\u2019t even glance in her fianc\u00e9\u2019s direction. Instead she smiled at him. \u201cWould you like to stroll with me?\u201d</p><p>Damon tucked her hand into his and turned toward the door. \u201cAlways,\u201d he said. And then: \u201cJealousy is a dish best served cold.\u201d</p><p>She tossed her head. \u201cI have no reason for revenge.\u201d She stopped suddenly and looked up at him. \u201cWere you implying something about Jemma and Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said, hoping it was true. \u201cJemma would never take your fianc\u00e9. Have more faith than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry; that was horrid of me,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI should never have thought such an ugly thing.\u201d</p><p>Something that might have been honesty compelled him to add, \u201cThough if Villiers wins the chess match, of course, all bets are off.\u201d</p><p>They walked for a moment and then Roberta turned a stricken face up to his. \u201cI\u2019m a fool. I didn\u2019t realize the implications of their chess game. I am not sophisticated enough for the life of the ton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe Reeves are particularly degenerate. But truthfully, I do not believe that Jemma intends to dally with Villiers beyond a flirtation. For one thing, they are both far too obsessed by chess to take a true interest in each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said something like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess is a mania,\u201d Damon said. \u201cThere are those who play with such enthusiasm that they think about it all the time, day and night. My father was one of those. He was brilliant at the game, and he devoted himself to teaching his children everything he knew. Jemma turned out to be the only one of us who found any enjoyment in the game, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even play whist very well,\u201d Roberta said morosely.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t challenge your future husband to a game of dollymop dominoes. I have a feeling that Villiers wins every game of skill he attempts. Would you mind if we went upstairs to say goodnight to Teddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course...what\u2019s a dollymop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grope is a refined example of a dollymop,\u201d Damon said.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what are dollymop dominoes?\u201d</p><p>He glanced sideways at her. \u201cDominoes with a special twist. Do you know how to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose so. I played with my governess as a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly the same game,\u201d he said, grinning at her. \u201cEvery time you draw a double bone, you have to take a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA domino piece; a double bone has a double number. And every time you lay down a spinner, a crosswise double, your opponent has to remove a piece of his clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>They were on the third floor and Damon pushed open the door to the nursery. \u201cRansom!\u201d he said. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing here? Where\u2019s the nanny?\u201d He looked around the room rather wildly. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t quit already, has she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to the best of my knowledge,\u201d Mr. Cunningham said, looking up from a book he was reading by the fire. \u201cShe is eating. Last night while she was at supper, Teddy evaded capture by a maid and ran from the room. So tonight she enquired whether I would watch him. He is asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not!\u201d said a voice, and a tousled head popped up from the bed.</p><p>\u201cHello, Pumpkin,\u201d Damon said, crossing the room and plucking his son from his bed.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Lady Roberta,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cAnother tooth, I lost it, do you want to see?\u201d And before she could say yea or nea, he pulled down his lip and showed her a red, gaping hole in his gum.</p><p>\u201cThat is truly disgusting, Teddy.\u201d</p><p>He grinned as if he had achieved something of notable importance. \u201cI can stick my tongue through the space,\u201d he told her, and did so.</p><p>Since he seemed to love to see her shudder, she obliged him a few times, and then she and Damon left the room again.</p><p>The last thing she heard before she left was Mr. Cunningham\u2019s quiet voice saying, \u201cYou\u2019re asleep now, Teddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterestingly enough, I didn\u2019t hear Teddy disagreeing with Mr. Cunningham\u2019s statement,\u201d Roberta commented once they were in the corridor.</p><p>\u201cRansom has a way of telling Teddy what to do that I find very instructive,\u201d Damon said. \u201cI played spindlesticks with my son this afternoon and I\u2019m afraid he showed rather less than gentlemanly manners when he lost the game. So I told him that he was ashamed of himself, in a very Ransom-esque manner, and Teddy burst into tears and agreed with me. It was all very satisfactory. Of course, it didn\u2019t stop him throwing the spindles across the room the very next game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cunningham must have had a great many siblings,\u201d Roberta said, not without a twinge of jealousy.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to have many children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it. I don\u2019t know very much about children. I have to confess that I found Teddy\u2019s gum truly stomach-turning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren are often stomach-turning,\u201d Damon said gloomily.</p><p>\u201cYou are a very good father.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cHow did you come to bring Teddy into your household?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, his eyes dark green in the dim light. \u201cHis grandmother brought him to me. I took one look at him and, as they say, that was that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roberta was longing to ask about Teddy\u2019s mother, but didn\u2019t quite dare. And she felt dimly ashamed of herself as well. Would she have done the same for Teddy? The thought made her feel shallow and\u2014</p><p>Damon took her hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no explaining it until you have one of your own,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a moment of madness. If I tell you that his grandmother handed over an infant with a soggy nappy...does that demonstrate just how remarkably deranged I became?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. But she didn\u2019t think he sounded deranged.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to do now?\u201d Damon asked. \u201cShall we rejoin the party or shall we do something utterly scandalous like walking in the garden?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one will even notice that we are absent,\u201d she said rather sourly.</p><p>\u201cI must admit that the young lady whom Jemma presumably invited to be my escort shows little interest in my company.\u201d His tone was so funny that Roberta started laughing. \u201cShe is spending the evening hanging on every word that has dropped from Beaumont\u2019s lips, though it doesn\u2019t seem to bother my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t. How the mighty are fallen. I\u2019m sure you were introduced to me as the gentleman whom all marriageable maidens desired...except, it seems, Miss Tatlock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not marriageable anymore,\u201d Roberta pointed out. \u201cI\u2019m engaged to the man currently playing a game of chess for the right to your sister\u2019s bed.\u201d She clapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that!\u201d</p> <p>But Damon was laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s calling a spade a spade.\u201d He seemed to be steering her outside, but the last thing Roberta wanted was to walk about under the smudgy London sky smelling of coal smoke. Besides, what Damon likely wanted was to push her against a tree and kiss her senseless, and she saw no reason why that couldn\u2019t happen in more pleasant surroundings. In fact...</p><p>\u201cWait here a moment!\u201d she said, and flew back up the stairs.</p><p>Two seconds later she was back, a box tucked under her arm.</p><p>Damon looked at it, and then his eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cI believe,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cthere is a chess game going on in the ballroom. Shall we take the library, or perhaps my chamber?\u201d She knew full well that the diabolical smile in his eyes was echoed on the edges of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cA friendly game of dominoes between cousins?\u201d he enquired.</p> <p>\u201cDollymop dominoes,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s played in all the best households.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u201d\u2014he said, leaning over and taking the box from her\u2014\u201chave made it one of my lifetime missions never to disappoint a family member.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll need to show me a game that\u2019s truly superior,\u201d she said, making her voice into a purr and feeling a thrill at her own sophistication. \u201cAnd not just your skills at the game either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live to please,\u201d he said.</p><p>And since his voice brought back to mind an image of a beautifully defined chest, muscles rippling as he threw a cowpat, Roberta had no doubt but that his reputation would be unflawed by a vigorous game of dominoes.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>J emma was a trifle irritated. She and Villiers played a side game of chess, but it was over almost before it began. Villiers set two traps for her simultaneously. She saw the chance to capture his bishop, but missed the chance to capture his knight. Either way, she lost her queen.</p><p>The moment she rose from the table, Harriet pulled her over to a small sofa. \u201cThings are going so well,\u201d she said happily.</p> <p>\u201cThey could be better,\u201d Jemma replied. If she had moved her knight to Queen\u2019s Bishop Three in the fourth round...</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean the particular game,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI mean your strategy. Villiers is set to be married. It was such a brilliant twist to invite your husband to play a game at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t invite him; Beaumont challenged me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChallenged you! Perhaps he is hoping that your marriage will improve.\u201d</p><p>Jemma shrugged. \u201cI take one look at his John the Baptist face and I feel the weight of every one of my sins. There\u2019s no possibility of that.\u201d</p><p>Harriet hesitated. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t fall in love with Villiers, would you? I should feel terrible if I led you into something that might hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Jemma laughed. \u201cYou think that Villiers will cause some overset of my reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I still feel such shame about the night that I\u2014that I gave in to him,\u201d Harriet whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if Benjamin died that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Jemma said, leaning forward. \u201cYou did not betray Benjamin. You were close to it, but that is not the same. I know. I\u2019ve betrayed Beaumont several times, though never before he did so to me. And the first time was shocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what grips me to the heart?\u201d Harriet said. \u201cWhat if Villiers told Benjamin? What if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin did not end his life because of a stolen kiss in a carriage,\u201d Jemma snapped, truly alarmed at the strained look in Harriet\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut what if he did? What if Villiers did not tell the truth of that evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you accuse Villiers of embellishing his account?\u201d</p><p>Harriet\u2019s eyes were agonized. \u201cWhat if he did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it of him. He is not an unscrupulous player, nor is he a canny one. His play is actually similar to mine, which is why I will win the match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s petty, but would you dedicate the match to Benjamin? No one talked of the fact that Villiers drove Benjamin to it. No one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do my best,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, Harriet. Would you like me to ask Villiers if he spoke to Benjamin about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess is the most intimate game in the world. It\u2019s like making love. By the time we finish our first slow game, I will know all his thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different about a slow game from a quick one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think about his move, and my move, all day long,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt lurks in the back of my mind, a hundred intriguing possibilities. I shall know him to the core when this game is finished, let alone when we have played out a match.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cStab him in the back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloodthirsty wench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe engagement went off just as you planned,\u201d Harriet said, changing the subject. \u201cBut you\u2019re right about Damon. I had a hard time getting him to stop looking at Roberta for all of five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Jemma frowned. \u201cMy brother is so used to being chased by marriageable maidens that I\u2019m afraid he can\u2019t quite accept the fact that Roberta thinks herself in love with Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she?\u201d Harriet was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. Being in love is great fun, don\u2019t you think? It may not last forever, but she\u2019s enjoying herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Harriet said sadly. \u201cI have only been in love with Benjamin, and now I\u2019m so angry at him that it poisons all my memories. Isn\u2019t that awful, Jemma? To be so angry at someone who is dead?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am angry at him too. He should never have treated you so lightly. Nor life either. But that doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t love him, Harriet.\u201d</p><p>Harriet\u2019s eyes were all shiny with tears, but she gave Jemma a kiss and made her way out into the darkness. The door of the carriage slammed shut and it moved off through the fog, the sound of horses\u2019 hooves growing indistinct immediately.</p><p>Of course she would win. True, Villiers had beaten her today, in a very pretty stratagem. But she would win the match.</p><p>Jemma went inside, but when Fowle stepped back, thinking she would rejoin her guests in the ballroom, she shook her head and asked Fowle to give her excuses. She had seen enough of Miss Tatlock giggling at her husband\u2019s every word. Roberta and Damon had disappeared at some point, possibly together, which was a complication she didn\u2019t want to consider. And frankly, a little of Mrs. Grope\u2019s company was more than enough, although her tip about using ceruse to prevent wrinkles was interesting.</p> <p>What she would prefer would be to work through a few of Francesch Vicent\u2019s 100 Chess Problems. She headed up the stairs.</p><p>Forty minutes later she was bathed and wrapped in a comfortable dressing gown, with her hair bundled up in a towel. \u201cYou may go, Brigitte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hair, Your Grace,\u201d Brigitte said. \u201cIt will dry with curls in it.\u201d</p><p>But Jemma was seated before her chess board, with a glass of French brandy and her copy of Vicent. She smiled apologetically, and Brigitte (who had strong views about the supreme importance of appearance) banged her way out of the room.</p><p>\u201cCome in!\u201d Jemma called impatiently, an hour later, or it might have been two. She expected a weary maid, but instead her husband stood there, looking as perfectly groomed and attired as he had at the beginning of the evening.</p> <p>\u201cBeaumont,\u201d she said, moving her bishop. \u201cIs there something I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>He walked over and looked down at her book. \u201cVicent?\u201d he asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about that book in years. Villiers and I worked our way straight through it at some point.\u201d</p><p>Which was all the more reason for Jemma to do just the same if she meant to beat Villiers as soundly as she wished. Not to mention Beaumont himself.</p><p>He sat down without being asked. \u201cWhat about moving your rook to King\u2019s Four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo moves with his rook and I would be in check. Are you thinking of setting up that young woman as your next mistress?\u201d</p><p>He raised his head from the board, and the look in his eyes almost made Jemma flinch.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a well-bred young woman,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you hoped to avoid a scandal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no need of a mistress.\u201d</p><p>Heat scorched Jemma\u2019s spine. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cI was not implying that the position was open, but I didn\u2019t expect such loyalty on your part. Your mistress is still with you, then?\u201d She schooled her face to an expression of benign enquiry.</p><p>\u201cShe is not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s been replaced. You soothe my spirits, Beaumont. Watching you with Charlotte Tatlock I feared that you were about to flare into true scandal.\u201d</p><p>His mouth barely moved when he spoke. \u201cI am not intending anything untoward with Miss Tatlock. I merely enjoy speaking to her about politics. She is, you see, interested in what goes on in England.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a faint smile. \u201cUnusual in a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p> <p>Without looking at the board again, he said, \u201cQueen to King\u2019s Three and you have him in four moves.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the board, saw what he was talking about. \u201cNot if black moves his rook to block me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible, but it\u2019s the only move I see that will open up your board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it because it counters black\u2019s attack,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI dislike finding myself under attack, it\u2019s true. At the moment, I am one move away from open warfare on a number of fronts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDue entirely to my return from Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmanent scandal,\u201d he said. \u201cI now house a woman of ill repute and an illegitimate child, and my last ball featured a nearly naked Helen whose songs were hardly proper. My wife is widely believed to be playing a game with the Duke of Villiers, in which she herself is the prize.\u201d</p><p>She felt anger sweeping up her spine, making her head reel. \u201cYou simply wish everything to be kept silent, is that it? You have your mistress, and flirt with a young unmarried lady until she looks at you with stars in her eyes, but that\u2019s not a scandal, because to you neither woman matters. All I do, Beaumont, is live my life without hypocrisy. Perhaps that is something a politician cannot understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live your life with the easy arrogance of someone who has never cared a damn for anything or anyone except yourself.\u201d His tone was crushingly blunt. \u201cI suppose you care for chess, Jemma, but from what I gathered, you never really gave a damn for those men you partnered in Paris.\u201d</p><p>She sprang to her feet. \u201cHow dare you suggest that I didn\u2019t care for them? You know nothing of my relations!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you were sleeping with Monsieur Philidor for a matter of years,\u201d he said, rising in his turn. \u201cI could only hope there was no payment involved; his regular visits to your house suggested a relation embellished by francs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d she cried. \u201cPhilidor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t wish to know what Philidor was to you. Let\u2019s just assume that I underestimated your ability for emotion and you care a great deal for the man. Should I, as your husband, applaud that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see if I can get this straight. You are suggesting that Philidor was my courtesan? Forgive me; I don\u2019t know the correct term for a male. Paramour, perhaps. Could I ask exactly how my taking a paramour would differ from your relation with Sarah Cobbett?\u201d</p><p>And when he didn\u2019t reply, \u201cIt\u2019s only been eight years, Beaumont. Surely you remember the name of your former mistress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am merely surprised that you know it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d she said with a shrug, \u201cthere were many people happy to tell me all her circumstances after I realized the truth of our marriage. Did you think to keep it secret?\u201d</p><p>And when he said nothing, \u201cI see you did. How very odd. Even had I not discovered the two of you in such an awkward way, someone would have told me in the near future. I found myself glad of it, afterwards. Do you know: I was so stupid and young, that I might not have believed it without visual proof? I don\u2019t believe I would have understood that you might bound from my bed to hers\u2014at least figuratively, since you bedded her on a desk.\u201d</p><p>She was possessed by an icy fury that no one except her husband had ever inspired in her. \u201cThat is quite different from you, Beaumont. You have no difficulty whatsoever believing that Philidor was somehow in my employ, even though you never saw me lying beneath him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you show so much curiosity, I will reward you with the gift of information. I have never paid a gentleman for his favors; unlike you, I seem to be lucky enough to attract lovers who need no payment. And I have never led on a man who did not understand the game at hand. Perhaps you are blind enough that you did not see the way Charlotte Tatlock looked at you tonight. I don\u2019t know why I was so surprised. Surely I could simply look back at myself eight years ago and recognize her stupidity.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThose are harsh words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure that you will be able to dismiss my criticism of your private life.

Brigitte appeared a few minutes later, correctly interpreting that angry peal as commanding haste.</p><p>\u201cTell Fowle that you will deliver the chess moves to him every night,\u201d Jemma said. She scribbled on a piece of paper. \u201cHere are the moves so far. There are perhaps four days left in each game, possibly longer in Beaumont\u2019s case. I don\u2019t suppose that Villiers is still in the house?\u201d</p><p>Brigitte dropped a curtsy. \u201cIf you please, my lady, he has been partnering Miss Charlotte in a game of whist with the marquess and Lord Corbin, and they are just leaving now.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte Tatlock? Why not? Why shouldn\u2019t the woman play with both Beaumont and Villiers? It made sense in a queer sort of way.</p> <p>\u201cAsk him to step upstairs, if you would,\u201d she said.</p><p>Brigitte was far too wise to ask any questions. She dropped into a curtsy and left the room before Jemma could say another word.</p><p>Jemma swept the chessboard clean and sat down to wait for Villiers.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>I n the end, they settled in a small sitting room, the same one to which Jemma had first brought Roberta. Damon rang the bell while Roberta wandered over to say hello to Judith\u2019s foolish, tipsy face, but she had been removed.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to drink,\u201d Damon said, \u201cand since it\u2019s an essential part of dollymop dominoes, we are, you should eat something. You didn\u2019t touch your food at supper.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not fond of ornate food,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI would grow very thin living with a French cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou prefer apples and hard-boiled eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that, but our cook at home is gifted at simple dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeaumont\u2019s cook is definitely French, with the temperament of a devil, or so Ransom tells me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it odd that your school friend would end up secretary to the duke?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I recommended him for the post.\u201d The door opened. \u201cAh, Fowle,\u201d Damon said. \u201cMay we please have a small repast and a bottle or two of champagne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not like champagne,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cSome other drink perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like wine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s sweet.\u201d</p><p>Damon shuddered. \u201cIntolerable. We have nothing of the sort in the house, and if we did, you\u2019d have a terrible headache in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRatafia?\u201d Fowle suggested.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. I don\u2019t want our guest casting up her accounts tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I would suggest a gentle concoction of champagne and strawberries, my lord. Strawberries just arrived from the country, and I believe it will make the champagne tolerable to Lady Roberta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChampagne with fruit doused in it,\u201d Damon said morosely.</p><p>But Fowle was right. It was delicious.</p><p>\u201cI shall ring if we need anything further,\u201d Damon told Fowle and then, turning back to Roberta, \u201cThere\u2019s no better way to nurture gossip among the servants.\u201d</p><p>Roberta shrugged. \u201cThe servants in this household have so much to occupy them; I\u2019m sure we\u2019re at the bottom of the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true that your engagement should keep them talking for the evening,\u201d Damon said, cautiously sipping his drink. \u201cIt\u2019s pink,\u201d he said with disgust, \u201cand there\u2019s sugar in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cChampagne always bites the back of my nose, but this is lovely.\u201d</p><p>Damon brought over a small table and placed it between them. \u201cDo you know how to play dominoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me that before,\u201d Roberta said, giggling. She had finished her glass and the world seemed a much more cheerful place. \u201cIn fact, I always beat my governess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuperior skill at matching sixes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have very good luck,\u201d she said smugly. \u201cI often draw doubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall prepare to disrobe,\u201d Damon said, loosening his cuffs.</p><p>Roberta froze for a moment. Then she picked up her pieces. Her mind was a little fuzzy but she was quite certain of the important things. Her fianc\u00e9 had said that chastity was tiresome. That same fianc\u00e9 was playing a game of chess whose outcome had everything to do with loss of clothing.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just see what happens, shall we?\u201d she said, smiling at Damon.</p><p>He sat opposite her, looking a little perplexed. That was because he was a man. She turned all the pieces face down and prepared to draw.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute!\u201d he said, and the wicked gleam was in his eye. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you were cheating your poor old governess by memorizing where the doubles were.\u201d He shuffled the pieces.</p><p>She managed to keep a pitying smile off her face because when a man is about to lose all his clothing, he needs his composure.</p><p>She drew the highest piece, a six, so she pulled all her bones first. She didn\u2019t draw a double in her original three, which was a wee bit disappointing.</p><p>She played and sipped her drink.</p><p>Damon handed her a tiny square of iced cake. \u201cYou should try this, Buttercup. It\u2019s just as sugary as the champagne.\u201d</p><p>It was lovely, so she ate it while she drew her next piece, a double three. She didn\u2019t tell him, though, until two moves later when she put it down crosswise as a spinner.</p><p>\u201cWait a second,\u201d he said startled. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to tell me when you draw a double. You have to drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been drinking,\u201d she pointed out. His glass was still full, but she threw back the last drops of her second glass and fished out the slice of strawberry with her tongue. He seemed to enjoy watching her do that, so she licked the edge of the glass.</p><p>He wrenched his eyes away. \u201cWell, so you put down a spinner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means that you have to take off a piece of your clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to be quite so eager. I\u2019m wearing a great deal of clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not eager,\u201d she said loftily. \u201cJust curious.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his jacket and threw it to the side. Underneath he wore an embroidered waistcoat and a linen shirt.</p><p>\u201cThat waistcoat doesn\u2019t quite match your jacket,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cMy valet made the same comment, but it was too late. I already had it buttoned.\u201d He selected a new piece. \u201cOh, no. A double. That means I have to drink.\u201d He took a large swallow and shuddered visibly.</p><p>\u201cHow could you not like it?\u201d Roberta said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely delicious. I feel quite swimmy.\u201d</p><p>Damon put down a piece but it wasn\u2019t his double. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for my spinner, but you should beware.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile Roberta drew another double and put it down directly as a spinner.</p><p>\u201cI can see there are benefits to your sort of luck,\u201d he said. His waistcoat followed his jacket.</p><p>She glanced at him from under her lashes. His shirt was so fine it was almost transparent. He had beautifully cut muscles in his shoulders. As she watched he rolled up his sleeves. \u201cThough why I bother,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose I\u2019ll have this shirt on my back much longer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roberta smiled to herself.</p><p>But to her vexation, it was she who began to lose clothing next. Damon put down the spinner he drew earlier. She was experiencing the most deliciously fuzzy feeling, so rather than lean over, she simply pointed a foot at Damon.</p><p>\u201cVery small feet,\u201d he said, holding her ankle. \u201cAnd sweetly turned ankles.\u201d He drew off her right shoe.</p><p>A moment later she lost the left one as well.</p> <p>\u201cI had better not lose any more,\u201d she said, sitting up straight.</p><p>She put down a spinner. \u201cIt seems that I\u2019ll have to take off my shirt,\u201d Damon said. His voice was as sweet as strawberry champagne and far more dangerous.</p><p>Roberta put down her drink. After all, this was her very first male chest, and she might as well have a good view.</p><p>He played right along, smiling at her as if he exhibited himself to young ladies every day. First he took his time pulling the shirt from his breeches, and then he slowly pulled it up over his head.</p><p>Roberta\u2019s lips made a silent O. He was so beautiful. Smooth muscles rippled as the shirt flew to the ground. Her fingers twitched, wanting to touch them.</p> <p>\u201cYour move,\u201d Damon said gently.</p><p>Roberta dragged her eyes away from his body. She reached forward and picked up a domino piece, cool and long in her fingers. She knew it was a double without looking. She turned it over, thinking that he would have to take off his breeches\u2014</p><p>It was a three.</p><p>She made a little, disappointed sound before she realized and he let fly with a bellow of laughter. \u201cOne of the things I really like about you, Buttercup, is that you\u2019re almost transparent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d she said, stung. \u201cI can be very Machiavellian when I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh really?\u201d he asked, his eyes dancing over the edge of his glass. \u201cI bet you\u2019re no good at lying whatsoever. You look like a girl who never told a decent lie in her life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI certainly have,\u201d she protested. \u201cWhy, I regularly tell Mrs. Grope that her hair is remarkably elegant.\u201d</p><p>Damon visibly shuddered. \u201cSo you tell white lies. But have you ever told a lie about something you really felt deeply about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I feel deeply about Mrs. Grope\u2019s hair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that. Now look me in the face and tell me a lie about something you really care about, something you feel desperately about.\u201d</p><p>What did she feel desperate about anyway? The champagne had made her so cheerful that she didn\u2019t feel desperate about anything...except, perhaps, seeing Damon take off his breeches.</p><p>She must have looked blank, because he said, \u201cTell me that you\u2019re not in love with Villiers. Go on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in love with Villiers,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cTerrible!\u201d he said. \u201cYour eyes went all soft and moony even mentioning his name.\u201d</p> <p>In Roberta\u2019s opinion, her eyes went soft and moony because\u2014the horror of it\u2014for a moment she couldn\u2019t remember who Villiers was. Champagne was dangerous.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to draw another double,\u201d she said, keeping her voice firm. \u201cAbsolutely not. I will simply faint if I draw another double.\u201d</p><p>Something flared in his eyes that made her belly fire in response.</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that, Buttercup?\u201d he asked. He pulled a two from the pile and played it.</p><p>She kept her voice casual. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that you\u2019ll take this game too seriously. That you might have misunderstood me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Apparently this took him by surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that you\u2019ll think I\u2019m like all those other young women, chasing after you in hopes of marrying you.\u201d</p><p>He gave a bark of laughter. \u201cI can distinguish a mountain from a molehill, Roberta!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so long as we\u2019re in agreement. Now if I could just draw a two...\u201d She turned over the piece.</p><p>\u201cDouble two\u2019s,\u201d she said cheerily. \u201cAnd\u2014how lucky!\u2014I can create a spinner from the two you just played.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were unreadable. \u201cI seem to have lost track of this conversation. Were you exhibiting an unexpected brilliance at fibbing, or are you really afraid that I\u2019ll consider you a marital prospect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hardly a marital prospect,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI\u2019m in love with someone else, and I\u2019m engaged to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Damon reached down and pulled off a shoe. \u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we make a bet that you won\u2019t be able to tell whether I\u2019m lying or not?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve lost all faith in my ability to read your mind.\u201d</p><p>Roberta took another delicious swallow of champagne. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9 and I are going to have a sophisticated marriage,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cSophisticated?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat means that we don\u2019t have to be prudish and chaste and tedious things of that nature. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m a baker, you know!\u201d She opened her eyes very wide.</p><p>He pulled off another shoe, even though it was his turn to move, but she decided not to mention it. It was too much fun to look at his chest.</p><p>\u201cYour muscles are quite beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you take exercise?\u201d He didn\u2019t seem to hear her, perhaps because he was putting his stockings to the side.</p><p>Roberta\u2019s heart was beating quickly.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being absolutely straightforward here,\u201d he said with a slow smile. \u201cI will not fear that you are hunting my considerable assets\u2014\u201d</p><p>She giggled.</p><p>\u201cInstead, I take it that you are here with the laudable desire to gain some experience before encountering Villiers in an intimate setting. After all, such an older man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not old,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s just his style. He always strikes me as bored by life. Enthusiastic only about chess. Though, of course, perhaps it will all change when he gets you alone in a bedchamber. God knows, we\u2019re not in a bedchamber and I\u2019m finding it a challenge not to leap on you like an untamed dog.\u201d</p><p>He sat down and pulled a five from the pile.</p><p>Roberta felt a flash of chill. It went without saying that Villiers would never compare himself to an unmannered mongrel. He would never sit opposite her, wearing nothing but a pair of breeches, looking as easy as if he were born to be naked.</p><p>Damon put down his piece and then looked up at her. Her heart almost stopped at the look in his eye. \u201cI dare you to pull a double from that pile,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go to my chambers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedtime?\u201d</p><p>Roberta wasn\u2019t sure what she was doing. She was teasing him, even though she didn\u2019t mean it, or did she? Her mind seemed to be drugged by the very sight of Damon. And it wasn\u2019t as if there was anyone who thought she shouldn\u2019t be here. Villiers had said\u2014had said\u2014</p><p>\u201cI suppose we ought to finish the game, since we started it,\u201d she said. Her heart was thudding against her ribs.</p><p>\u201cI always finish a game once it begins.\u201d</p><p>Roberta didn\u2019t think Damon was talking about dominoes. Was she ready for this?</p><p>\u201cThe world is a different place than I believed it to be while growing up,\u201d she said, pulling a four from the pile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>One of the intoxicating things about Damon was the way he looked so interested in her opinion. \u201cReally?\u201d He pulled a blank. \u201cWhat did you think the world would be like? It must have been rather remarkable, growing up with Mrs. Grope. I would hardly have thought you had a conventional upbringing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t conventional,\u201d Roberta said. She couldn\u2019t fit any of her pieces onto the board. \u201cWe\u2019re getting all cramped on the right side of the table.\u201d</p><p>He ladled a bit more strawberry champagne into her glass and pointed. \u201cOne of us needs to start a spinner with that four.\u201d</p><p>Roberta was feeling suddenly shy. She drew a one. \u201cMrs. Grope has only been a friend of my father\u2019s for the last few years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there was Selina...an actress.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, startled. \u201cYou can\u2019t mean Selina Trimmer, currently the lead actress at Drury Lane, not to mention inamorata of the Prince of Wales?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI gain a whole new respect for your father,\u201d he said, snagging a three from the pile. \u201cSelina is remarkably beautiful. Is she as temperamental in person as in reputation?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cShe found it very hard to live in the country and I\u2019m afraid it had a wearing effect on her composure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why on earth\u2014\u201d he said, and checked himself.</p><p>\u201cShe was in the grip of a passion for my father,\u201d Roberta explained, feeling a little thrill of parental pride. \u201cShe met Papa when the Drury Lane traveling company visited our estate. He persuaded her to stay for a brief visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow brief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lived with Selina Trimmer for two years!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t a Trimmer at that point,\u201d Roberta explained. \u201cThis game is so irritating, Damon. I don\u2019t think I can move anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. Put your one there,\u201d he said, pointing.</p><p>\u201cWe knew her as Selina Le Faye. But Selina felt that she would do better with a more English-sounding name, so when she decided to go to London, we concocted the name Trimmer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that it was an amicable parting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was no rancor. Of course, my father wept voluminously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear Roberta,\u201d Damon said, \u201cwhy on earth are you the least bit surprised by the goings on in this house? To put it bluntly, you have grown up in a household whose attention to conventional mores seems to have been fragile, to say the least.\u201d</p><p>Roberta had to think about that for a moment, which was just as well, because Damon had drawn a piece that he didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m surprised by intimacy outside of marriage,\u201d she said finally. \u201cBut my father was deeply in love with Selina, and then with Mrs. Grope. He loved them, both of them. It broke his heart when Selina decided that she could not continue to be happy in such a remote location as our home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t take her to London.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe that Selina felt it was time for something new, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Damon grinned. \u201cNicely put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is that I know something of what goes on between men and women,\u201d Roberta said. She could feel herself going a little pink. \u201cI hadn\u2019t actually seen anything until the other night, but I have\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off, seeing the utterly fascinated look on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou have what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that I am in possession of a rather unique amount of information about pleasuring men. At least for someone like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA virgin, you mean.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He put down his piece. \u201cIt seems that I, Roberta, have drawn a double four, which I shall place as a spinner in the one available spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, feeling her heart speed up again.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you take off?\u201d he asked. His grin was absolutely devilish.</p><p>But Roberta had already thought this through. She stood and pulled up her skirts in the back, where he couldn\u2019t see. With a sharp pull, she untied the ribbon that held her hooped petticoat in place. It fell to the floor, and Roberta stepped neatly out of the frame.</p><p>Damon\u2019s face fell. \u201cThat was sneaky,\u201d he said, getting up. Before she realized what he was doing, he picked Roberta up in his arms and sat back down on his chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she yelped.</p><p>\u201cI love holding a woman who isn\u2019t wearing an iron-wrought frame around her body,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy hoops aren\u2019t made of iron,\u201d Roberta said. He smelled so good that it was hard to think. Instead she just snuggled into his chest. It was soft, like velvet but not velvety. She ran a finger over the contours of his chest.</p><p>\u201cButtercup,\u201d he said in a husky whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s your turn to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a moment.\u201d</p><p>He busied himself by kissing her ear, and Roberta flattened her hand against his chest. He was warm, hot, in fact. And smooth chested.</p><p>\u201cWill you grow hair as you age?\u201d she asked, running her hand over his chest again. It was intoxicating. He had a nipple, which she wouldn\u2019t have expected. His was flat, not like hers. She ran her fingers over it again. And again.</p><p>His voice sounded a little strained. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Why? Do you hanker after chest hair?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cNo. The only male chest I\u2019ve ever seen belonged to a groom, and he had white hair all over his front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Villiers will have all the white hair you want,\u201d he said. And then: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Roberta. That was entirely uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>She squeaked. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking up for my rudeness,\u201d he said, his voice entirely serious. \u201cIt\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>Roberta thought about that, but none too steadily because his fingers were sliding up her leg, and farther. It was as if she could feel her skin as he felt it, curved, smooth, rounding under his fingers. His breath was coming faster and his fingers\u2014</p><p>She cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d His fingers slid forward again.</p><p>It felt so good\u2014too good. She jumped to her feet. \u201cMy turn to draw a piece!\u201d She sat down hurriedly, avoiding his eyes. He uncoiled himself, leaning forward, all taut male muscle. She snatched a piece and then stared down at it.</p><p>His hand plucked the piece from her fingers. \u201cAnother double four,\u201d he said. His eyes smiled at her, and suddenly that melting feeling Roberta felt from the touch of his fingers was there, even without being touched. She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to make a spinner,\u201d he said. Quietly. As if it were an ordinary invitation.</p><p>Roberta looked him over. In the candlelight, Damon was all golden skin and shifting muscles. Her father always said there was only one reason to act impetuously: if she really wanted something. Roberta had heaped scorn on her father\u2019s maxim, given that following his whims was so frequently antithetical to the mores of polite society.</p><p>But now she saw the wisdom of it all.</p><p>What she wanted was to lose her inconvenient virginity to Damon. Then she would marry Villiers and embark on a life of reckless sophistication. But at the moment... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can see that you are likely shy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to expose yourself for the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first...\u201d</p> <p>She was standing up, and his voice trailed into silence. First she pulled off her stockings. They dropped to the ground, frail and silken, with a gleam like trapped sunshine. Damon\u2019s eyes followed them with some fascination, she thought.</p><p>She waited until he met her eye again, and then slowly, slowly, she began unlacing the front of her gown.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. In fact, he looked as frozen as a man might be who was trying to lure a fawn into eating from his hand. But Roberta didn\u2019t feel like a fawn. She felt like a powerful woman doing exactly as she wished. Her bodice gaped open as she bent to pick up her glass.</p><p>He turned slightly red. Roberta took a drink and surreptitiously checked his breeches...yes. He was interested. Very, if that look in his eye were any indication. She bent to put her glass down again, thought about kissing him, and decided that she might as well get rid of her gown first. So she gave an easy roll of her shoulders.</p><p>It fell to the ground, all embroidered silk and gold lace. \u201cIt was heavy,\u201d she told him. He didn\u2019t look as if he would disagree; his eyes were eating her up.</p> <p>\u201cThose stays are heavy as well,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey lace in the back.\u201d She turned around and waited.</p><p>He must have leaped to his feet, because she heard a bang, as if he knocked against the table, and then his long, clever fingers were at her back. She held the stays against her and turned around before she let them fall to the floor. The bodice of her chemise was extremely low, the better to accommodate the neckline of her gown. In fact, it barely covered her nipples at all. And it was made of fine lawn edged in lace.</p><p>\u201cYour next move would surely be a spinner,\u201d Damon said. His voice was smoky, almost sleepy. He pulled his breeches down and put them away.</p><p>Roberta was afraid to look. Her heart was thudding against her ribs, dancing a rhythm that she hardly knew and yet recognized with an age-old wisdom. That same wisdom was in her smile as she put her arms around his neck and then, still without looking, brought her body against his.</p><p>He made a muffled sound, like a groan, and his lips were in her hair and his hands were against her back.</p> <p>\u201cButtercup,\u201d he whispered, \u201cthere\u2019s no going back from this. You do realize that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. She\u2019d discovered his ear and was doing exactly what he\u2019d done to hers earlier: kissing it and then, daringly, touching him with her tongue.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and put her away.</p><p>Roberta grinned at him. He was having male scruples, no doubt. She\u2019d watched her father wrestle with those for years, and in her opinion, the wrestling always ended up in the same way: her father did exactly what he wanted to. Her job was to make sure that Damon wanted to do exactly what she wanted.</p><p>So she lifted her arms and started pulling pins from her hair. It had been coiled and curled and pinned all over. She pulled pin after pin, and he said nothing. Finally her hair tumbled beyond her shoulders. She bent over and gave it a good shake to get rid of the powder.</p><p>Damon stared at Roberta\u2019s sweet little bottom as she bent over and had the feeling of a man drowning\u2014with nary a soul to throw him a life buoy. Kissing Roberta was one thing...but her virginity? He\u2019d never done such a thing.</p><p>He could only do it if he were intending to marry her.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t want to hear that yet. She was giggling, and the sound went to his heart and his blood sang with joy.</p> <p>She was his, whether she wished to acknowledge it or not.</p><p>Roberta straightened up and turned around. Dark red curls tumbled all over her bare arms, but it was those crazy arching eyebrows and dark plump lips that caught his heart. No one could say that she looked innocent. Hell, after growing up with Selina, she probably knew more about bedding than he did.</p><p>Except...he remembered the stunned look on her face when they walked in on that couple tupping in the sitting room.</p><p>She was an enchanting mixture of innocence and sophistication.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t do this,\u201d he said, knowing the truth of it. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, Roberta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBedding you. I can\u2019t do this. I can\u2019t take your virginity when you\u2019re not married, and you\u2019re in love with someone else, even engaged to him.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned a shade darker blue and Damon instinctually felt that was a bad sign.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDo you think that you\u2019re taking advantage of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand the ways of the ton. Hell, your father was crazy to let you come to Jemma\u2019s house. She\u2019s no fit person to take care of a young woman. She\u2019s married, Roberta. Married. And playing chess with\u2014\u201d Too late he remembered that Jemma was playing chess with Roberta\u2019s fianc\u00e9.</p><p>She had her hands on her hips. \u201cJemma, whom I adore, by the way, and am not in the least jealous of, is playing chess with Villiers. To whom I am engaged to marry. Villiers told me that my chastity was unattractive, and that he didn\u2019t give a damn who I had slept with, as long as I don\u2019t give him a cuckoo to raise. Damon, do you know how to prevent conception?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because so do I, but my understanding is that male participation makes it much more effective.\u201d</p><p>His mouth fell open. \u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelina lived with us from the time I was fourteen to the time I was sixteen. I loved her. She gave me a great deal of advice, sister to sister.\u201d</p><p>He snapped his mouth shut. \u201cYou had sisterly conversations with Selina Trimmer.\u201d He wrenched his mind away from the T\u00eate-\u00e0-T\u00eate report of Selina\u2019s latest party, in which it was reported that she had filled her bathtub with vintage champagne and invited several guests to watch her bathe. It was also reported that two of them joined her in the tub.</p><p>\u201cDo you need some education?\u201d Roberta demanded, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cForget I asked that. The point is, Roberta, not how much you learned from Selina, but how much I would take away from you by making love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re practically a family member, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Your cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall find someone else,\u201d she said. \u201cIn case it isn\u2019t clear to you, Damon, I shall not be carrying my inconvenient virginity to bed with Villiers. After all, I\u2019m in love. I wouldn\u2019t bore my husband with such a task, and if you don\u2019t feel like taking it on, there\u2019s no point in crying over it. I shall simply find another man who is more eager.\u201d</p><p>Damon almost laughed at that. He\u2019d never felt so damned eager to do anything in his life. In fact\u2014</p><p>She was laughing at him. Still a little angry, but laughing. Christ, she was magnificent. Her chemise was of fine lawn, and it barely skimmed her leg, stopping just above her rounded kneecap.</p><p>\u201cYou go to another man only when I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>She clearly didn\u2019t realize that he\u2019d just declared himself. \u201cI realize that you are used to women tripping over themselves, trying to woo you into marriage,\u201d she said, eyes sparkling. \u201cBut don\u2019t you understand that I\u2019m not like them? I don\u2019t want your ring, or your money, or your title.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you have Villiers.\u201d Saying his name aloud steadied Damon.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou need to understand that. I\u2019m a terribly hard-headed woman, and I always have been. You can ask my father. I knew the moment that I saw Villiers that I wanted to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He had to ask. \u201cAnd don\u2019t say because you\u2019re in love. I\u2019m not a big believer in love at first sight, and I\u2019m not entirely sure that you are either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you put it,\u201d she said. \u201cI look at Villiers and I know exactly what sort of marriage we will have, and it\u2019s exactly the sort I want to be involved in. He is controlled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cControlled?\u201d Damon was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying Villiers because he\u2019s controlled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will never embarrass me. He will never launch into gushing flights of emotion. He will never write a poem to my toe, or any other part of my body. He will never weep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re right about that,\u201d Damon said. \u201cIt could be your funeral, and Villiers would just stand there with that snarling little smile of his.\u201d</p><p>She walked over to him and put a hand on his arm. She didn\u2019t even seem to feel the slightest bit of embarrassment at being in her chemise, nor at the fact that he was next thing to naked. She truly wasn\u2019t a normal virgin. Whatever that was. \u201cVilliers is right for me. And I am lucky that he recognized the same in me. We will be an excellent match and I think we\u2019ll live together happily for years.\u201d</p><p>Damon\u2019s teeth were so tightly clenched he thought he might break his jaw. \u201cFine,\u201d he managed. \u201cMarried bliss. I see it. You and Villiers will get old together except\u2014hold on a moment!\u2014he\u2019s already old, so I guess you\u2019ll be a happy widow.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes turned a dark navy again, and every bit of native caution he had in his body warned him that was an even worse sign.</p><p>He was right.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an ass. I have no idea why you are being such an ass, but I\u2019ve learned over the years that men are impossible to understand, and so I shan\u2019t try to fathom you. There\u2019s something I want from you, Damon.\u201d</p><p>His mouth went dry. \u201cThere is?\u201d Every inch of his body knew exactly what she wanted, and those same inches were straining to satisfy her.</p><p>With one swift gesture, she pulled her chemise right over her head and tossed it to the side. Then she looked at him, and for just one moment, there was a flash of uncertainty in those beautiful eyes of hers.</p><p>That was enough. Every ethical sense that Damon had in his entire body melted like sugar in hot water.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure, Buttercup?\u201d He had her in his hands when he said it, his palms sliding over her round derri\u00e8re.</p><p>\u201cI choose you for my first experience with men,\u201d Roberta said, sounding far too logical for the moment.</p><p>He almost said something about her first man being her last, but he caught it back. She didn\u2019t want to hear it yet. She was hanging onto the dream of a controlled marriage.</p><p>Obviously, it was up to him to teach her the bliss of losing control.</p><p>He shut the thought off and dragged her against his chest. Little Miss Inexperienced Know-It-All was about to find out what it was like to actually sleep with a man, as opposed to talk about it.</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>H e had spread out the huge silk skirts of her gown and put her on it, but she wouldn\u2019t stay there. She was supposed to lie back and let him gently introduce her to the fruits of pleasure while she trembled and shrieked, \u201cNo, no!\u201d In fact, experienced matrons had done that on occasion, because he was the kind of man who thought that every inch of a woman tasted good.</p><p>But Roberta?</p> <p>She did squeal, and even squeak, but he hadn\u2019t heard a single \u201cNo, no.\u201d Sometimes he couldn\u2019t understand exactly what she was saying, but it sounded an awful lot like \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>So he let a bit more guilt slip away from him, and turned back to nuzzling her breast. What she liked best was when he sucked her nipples into his mouth. He kept doing that, and then pulling back and shaping her breasts in his hands, and even giving her little bites, and nibbles, until she was all calmed down\u2014of course, he wasn\u2019t; he\u2019d never been harder in his life\u2014and then he would suckle her again and her back would rise just like that, and she would start gasping and crying. He didn\u2019t even want to think about what would happen when he made his way down her body.</p><p>He was sliding his fingers there now, slowly because so often ladies didn\u2019t want to be touched, or rather, they had no idea what they wanted.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t getting much resistance from Roberta. He slid his fingers a bit lower, flicking her nipple with his tongue so that she didn\u2019t notice what he was doing. But then she shocked him because one of her beautiful slim legs slid up and she sobbed, \u201cDamon,\u201d and her knee fell open.</p><p>And if that wasn\u2019t an invitation?</p><p>Damon was a man who considered making love to be a work of art. You prepared the canvas (kisses) and then threw on some background (special attention to certain parts of the body) and then you painted the main event. With your brush, ha ha.</p><p>In other words, he never made love without generous attention to the woman, and in general he believed that she should come before he did.</p><p>Which must be why he found himself absolutely mad in this case, unable to stop himself. Because Roberta had the sweetest, reddest, most\u2014</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself. He couldn\u2019t. He was poised over her and she curled up against him with a little puffing wail of desire and even though he was a man who never came before the woman...</p><p>He did.</p><p>He thrust where no man had been. Into her plump sweetness, and the only thing he had enough self-possession to do was rub a thumb over her breasts at the same time.</p><p>Her eyes got huge, but he wasn\u2019t thinking, he couldn\u2019t think. His entire body was concentrated on the most glorious sensation of his life, on the sleekest, wettest, tightest experience of his life\u2014</p><p>She wasn\u2019t saying \u201cyes,\u201d anymore, but Damon didn\u2019t know it. He threw his head back and plunged forward a few times, almost sobbing at the exquisiteness of it. It was all too much, though, and he came with a muffled groan wrenched from his chest.</p><p>He collapsed on top of her but managed to catch most of his weight on his elbows. \u201cOh God\u201d\u2014he was babbling\u2014\u201cyou were\u2014that was\u2014Roberta, are you all right? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d She didn\u2019t look angry, just kind of perplexed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, do you?\u201d he said, feeling a rush of protectiveness and affection such as he\u2019d never experienced before. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, Roberta. Just let me have a moment to gather my strength and next time you\u2019ll...see...\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes to recover his strength.</p><p>Roberta St. Giles found herself lying next to a sleeping man.</p><p>She looked down at herself. There was no sign of blood, which was reassuring. She\u2019d heard various stories about gushing blood and then the opposite, from Selina, who told her that women over the age of twelve never felt a thing.</p><p>\u201cSurely not\u2014under twelve?\u201d she had asked. There was something closed about Selina\u2019s face that didn\u2019t allow her to finish that question.</p><p>Roberta sat up. Her body had a faint tingling sensation about it still. The whole experience was quite interesting, really. She looked down at Damon. He was peacefully sleeping. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was no longer a virgin. That statement meant about as much to her as she had thought it would. Virginity, like many things connected to men, was obviously vastly over-rated. And frankly, so was sexual intimacy.</p><p>No wonder Villiers didn\u2019t care if she\u2019d had previous experiences. It was all a matter of a minute at most. Yet there was something alarmingly intimate about it, for all its speed.</p><p>Damon\u2019s shoulder, for example. He was lying on his side, and his shoulder had a beautiful curve. She ran a finger along it. What she wanted now was a bath. There was a sticky feeling between her legs that she disliked. And, in truth, the experience wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable. In fact, she likely wouldn\u2019t do it again until marriage.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, touching his face. The angle of his cheek was beautiful. For a moment she thought about kissing him again; somehow, he\u2019d started touching her breasts, and they\u2019d never really kissed, and that was her favorite part of it all.</p> <p>But if she kissed him, he might wake up. And though it was kind of him to offer, she didn\u2019t feel like doing that again.</p><p>So instead she teased her gown out from under his body, holding her breath when he seemed as if he might wake up. When she got it free, she stood up and wrapped the gown around her like an enormous towel.</p><p>The servants in her father\u2019s house had been used to all sorts of extraordinary behavior; she could only hope\u2014and in truth, expect\u2014that Jemma\u2019s servants were equally imperturbable. There was one footman standing in the hallway, so she gave him a smile and sailed up the stairs.</p><p>Once in her room she dropped her gown and rang the bell. Her maid appeared, looking rather sleepy, and quite surprised to find her mistress wearing a dressing gown. After all, she couldn\u2019t have removed her stays by herself.</p><p>\u201cEllen, I\u2019ve left some of my clothing in the yellow sitting room,\u201d Roberta said, not wasting breath on feeble explanations. \u201cWe should probably send someone to fetch it, but not yet.\u201d</p> <p>Ellen nodded, showing that she was just as well trained as Roberta would have expected. \u201cWould you like a bath, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later three footmen staggered in carrying a zinc bath and buckets of water, and Roberta was able to climb into the scented water with a sigh. Ellen helped her wash her hair, and then Roberta told her she could go to bed. \u201cYou must be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t leave you in this state,\u201d Ellen said, looking sleepy. \u201cHow will you prepare for bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way I got myself into bed these last twenty years,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cMy maid at home was quite old and couldn\u2019t manage late nights, and so I always tucked myself in bed. In fact, I prefer it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you call a footman to remove the water?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I will. You go to bed.\u201d</p><p>Ellen curtsied and left. Then she stuck her head back around the door. \u201cI forgot to say that everyone below stairs is that pleased that you will be a duchess?\u201d</p><p>Roberta smiled at her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one will think the less of you for anticipating the wedding night, my lady...I\u2019ll ask Martin, the second footman, to fetch your clothing in an hour or so. He can stow it where no one can see.\u201d</p><p>Roberta\u2019s smile was a little crooked this time. One had to hope that Damon would get himself out of that room without being seen by Martin or anyone else.</p><p>The moment the door closed she leaned her head back against the edge of the bath with a sigh. She was half asleep by the time she pulled on a dressing gown and called a footman to remove the bath.</p><p>The bath was gone, and she had just sat down on the bed, still in her dressing gown, and was thinking about where her nightgown might be when the door swung open.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, blinking up at him. \u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d And then, with a squeak as she woke up, \u201cWhat are you doing in my bedchamber?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 31</p><p>V illiers stood quietly in the doorway, one eyebrow raised.</p><p>Jemma deliberately looked him over from head to toe: the sulky bottom lip, the dramatically streaked hair, the languid yet powerful stance. He was wearing a plum-colored coat embroidered with fire lilies; his hair ribbon matched. He wore one patch, high on his right cheek. He looked inexpressibly elegant even to her, who had lived for eight years in the shadow of the French court.</p><p>There was something about Villiers...about his penchant for clothing embroidered with peacock brightness, about his patch and his colored hair ribbon, about the deep intelligence in his gamester\u2019s eye, and the coiled power of his body.</p><p>\u201cDo come in,\u201d she said, indicating the chess board. \u201cA game, another side game, if you are not too tired?\u201d</p><p>His heavy silk coat sounded like a distant seashore as he walked. He closed the door behind him and then swept into a magnificent bow, as low as that one might give to a queen. \u201cYou do me too much honor, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma,\u201d she said.</p><p>His heavy-lidded eyes paused on her face for a moment. \u201cJemma.\u201d Her name sounded odd on his lips, and Jemma suddenly remembered the first time she was unfaithful to Beaumont. It had been in Paris, of course, after she fled England in rage and tears. Two years after she moved to Paris, it finally became clear to her that Beaumont was not coming after her to beg her to come home\u2014fool that she was, she had thought he would. In fact, he didn\u2019t even pay her a visit for three years, and by then it was too late.</p><p>She had fallen into bed with a merry French gentleman who taught her the pleasures of her own body and his. And yet that first night, her heart had been as heavy as it was now.</p><p>Why should it be heavy? She had the right to do precisely as she wished. She watched him sit opposite her, tossing his coat-skirts behind him so they wouldn\u2019t crease. \u201cYou may perhaps think that I do you more honor than I intend,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDear lady,\u201d Villiers said, \u201cI will take whatever scraps you throw from your table.\u201d</p><p>More of his curfluffle. Perhaps she should just tell him that she disliked his practiced gallantry.</p><p>\u201cA game?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have given you the advantage, as you see.\u201d</p><p>He played a piece and so did she. Again, and again. The rhythm of the game soothed her, wrapped her in the sweet complexities of knights and rooks and the powerful queen. Slowly her rage and mortification ebbed as her focus on the game sharpened. Her bishop was menaced. She rushed to save him, only to find that her queen\u2019s pawn was threatened. A troublesome move...she slowed to think. Paused, her fingers still on her rook, until she suddenly saw a path, took his rook.</p><p>He fought back, but her bishop took his queen...four moves later it was over. She won.</p><p>Then they parsed the game, playing it backwards.</p><p>\u201cWhen your rook took my pawn...that was a beautiful play,\u201d Villiers muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you had threatened my queen, so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because knight takes bishop...\u201d</p><p>It was almost more fun dissecting the game than playing it. Almost, but not quite. At the end, he leaned back and smiled at her. \u201cSometimes I think that chess is better than sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so always,\u201d she said, startling herself.</p><p>\u201cSomeone should change your mind on that subject.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She reached out and turned his hand over. \u201cPerhaps you could be the one to change my mind,\u201d she said, tracing a path on his palm with her finger. \u201cThat is, I would be pleased, but you are Roberta\u2019s fianc\u00e9, and the bonds between friends are stronger than those between lovers, in my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have few friends. The closest friend of my life was your husband, and that many years ago.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, but he was staring at her fingers on his hand. \u201cI know that you were close once...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the way of boys and small animals. Without thought for the future nor our differing personalities. But still, I find I have a fragment of honor left in me. I am not the person to show Beaumont\u2019s wife that the body is greater than the mind, and games of chess pale next to games in bed.\u201d He took her hand and kissed it, and there was something so sad in his eyes that she didn\u2019t even mind the fact she had been turned down.</p> <p>Though that had never happened before.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak to him?\u201d she asked impulsively. \u201cElijah needs friends. He needs someone to tell him to slow down, to drag him away from his work.\u201d</p><p>His smile was rueful. \u201cHe and I are centuries apart, in personality and taste. In all honesty, and without offense, I wouldn\u2019t wish to be particular friends with the Duke of Beaumont now. If it were a matter of being fourteen again, and playing a game of chess by the river...that I do miss. But those days are gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no wish to be fourteen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife was simpler. I do not let myself entertain regrets nor think about mistakes. My father always said, and he was right, that regret is a useless practice. But I find that in my thirties, regrets chase me down the street sometimes. It\u2019s not so easy to shrug them away.\u201d</p> <p>He was talking about Benjamin, perhaps. She thought about whether to mention his suicide too long, because Villiers asked her, \u201cWhat do you regret, Oh Duchess?\u201d</p><p>That made her grin. \u201cSo many things!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe absurd Italian hat I bought yesterday in Bond Street with Roberta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Roberta.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids dropped and she couldn\u2019t see his expression. \u201cYour fianc\u00e9e,\u201d she prompted.</p> <p>\u201cA charming young lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather,\u201d she said wryly, \u201cthat the dew is off the rose, for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another regret.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThey are like bad dreams; once you allow one, they come as thick and fast as leaves in autumn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will make you an excellent wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it to make you angry.\u201d He raised her hand and put one kiss in her palm, and then replaced it on the table, all without looking at her. \u201cI admit with some shame: You won our first game of chess.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head at him. \u201cYou asked someone to marry you out of pique?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that I take this game too seriously?\u201d</p><p>She found herself laughing, and then he joined in.</p> <p>\u201cOne never knows,\u201d he said a moment later. \u201cThere\u2019s many a slip between an engagement and the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something of that nature,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt would take an act of God,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cBut I think she will be the making of you, Villiers. Perhaps you will have the real marriage that I can only imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I cannot imagine such a thing,\u201d he said with some disdain. \u201cI shall pray for an act of God.\u201d He was at the door when he turned and said, \u201cI have had many lovers, Jemma.\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. \u201cI am the more disconcerted to be left out of the legion, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019ve had many lovers...but few friends.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone, before she thought how to reply.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>\u201cW hat happened to you? Where did you go?\u201d Damon demanded.</p><p>Roberta blinked. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you sneak off like a housemaid in the night and leave me in the sitting room?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help laughing a little. \u201cAre you telling me that you wanted me to stay around and watch you snore? Perhaps until the footman came in to bank the fire? I took a bath, just as you apparently did,\u201d she said, looking at his wet hair.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to show you what making love can be like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes you did,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cI thoroughly enjoyed it. Truly. I was simply\u2014\u201d</p><p>He swallowed all her words, and her protests, and her sensible points, just by pulling off his shirt, and then his breeches. A protest died in her throat. Without a word he lowered his hard masculine length on top of her. It was unsettling. A sort of hunger settled deep in her stomach that made her feel uneasy.</p><p>Then Damon started kissing her, and with a little moan, she opened her lips to him. She could taste his hunger, as if they passed it back and forth to each other. The uneasiness in her stomach was turning into something else, some sort of restlessness that brought her hands up to his powerful forearms. Her fingers trembled as she traced his muscles.</p><p>The feeling alarmed her, and with a sudden twist she rolled out from under him and sprang away from the bed. \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to be intimate again,\u201d she said, dismayed to realize that her breath was coming fast.</p><p>Damon didn\u2019t even seem to hear her. He started padding toward her, without a word, like a predator.</p><p>Roberta backed up as far as she could go, against her little armchair. \u201cDamon!\u201d she cried, trying to make her voice sound commanding. \u201cI prefer not\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he was kissing her again, fierce in his possession, and all her flimsy words blew away because the mere touch of his hands had her shivering.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped, but it was like throwing kindling on a fire; he laughed, deep in his throat and kissed her again, kissed her until she was trembling, her mind swirling, her body rocking against his, her voice strangled with the need to beg him\u2014</p><p>She never begged.</p><p>Never.</p><p>But then he stopped touching her and suddenly her body raged with the memory of his large hands shaping her breasts, rubbing her. He was just kissing her. That\u2019s all. As if\u2014</p><p>Of course, she wasn\u2019t touching him either. They were standing together, and the only thing touching was their mouths and it wasn\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cDamon,\u201d she said, her voice husky.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never lost control like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had nothing to do with your control. I think I just didn\u2019t enjoy that part of it very much. It\u2019s\u2014It\u2019s so fast, isn\u2019t it? And not\u2014\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cCan we talk about aberrations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, confused.</p><p>But he was there, scooping her up. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you, Buttercup,\u201d he said, putting her back on the bed and sitting down next to her.</p><p>Roberta was still trying to think what to say when he pulled open her dressing gown. Instinctively, she grabbed it back. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His eyes were full of slumberous intent, but she hung on. \u201cRoberta,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cif you don\u2019t let go, I\u2019m going to bite you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He put a finger on her breast and it sizzled, straight through the silk of her dressing gown. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, his voice husky. \u201cAnd perhaps\u201d\u2014his finger wandered down, leaving a trail of fire in its wake\u2014\u201chere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d bite my stomach?\u201d Her voice squeaked, so she sounded as foolish as she felt.</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cI thought you learned so much from your informative discussions with Selina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never talked about biting. And I\u2019d really rather not do that again,\u201d she confessed, though her cheeks turned pink.</p><p>He looked down at her, eyebrow raised, and there was such a flare of desire in his eyes that she instinctively moved her hips. But they encountered something hard and hot, and she shrank back. \u201cI bathed,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease, could we just not?\u201d</p><p>He groaned and his eyes shut. \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d she said reassuringly. Her fingers trembled as they slipped down his arms onto his broad back. \u201cI thought it was very interesting. Not at all as Selina described it, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Selina describe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she foundered, \u201cI thought it\u2014it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would take longer,\u201d he said grimly, his mouth a straight line.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, frowning at the look on his face. \u201cNo, not at all. It was just as she described it, that way.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cWonderful. What else did Selina say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that a woman has to take her own pleasure,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think there was any pleasure for me to take that you didn\u2019t give me, Damon.\u201d She didn\u2019t like that look on his face at all, so she arched up against his body to kiss him, her lips sliding over his lips to his cheek. \u201cTruly,\u201d she said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said, \u201care an innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not!\u201d she said, flopping back down on the bed. \u201cNo one raised in my father\u2019s household could call herself an innocent!\u201d</p><p>He suddenly grinned. \u201cAll right.\u201d He pushed back on his forearms and rolled away to lie next to her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cTake your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you learned from Selina. And believe me, Roberta, you didn\u2019t get a chance to do it downstairs. I took all the pleasure there was to be had.\u201d His eyes had a shade of self-condemnation that she hated.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she told him, \u201cbut it was enormously pleasurable. Truly.\u201d</p><p>In response he just flung his arms above his head. \u201cGo on,\u201d he said. \u201cTake your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Roberta was confused. Selina had never been entirely clear about what she meant, but Roberta had (obviously mistakenly) formed the conclusion that a woman should demand that her partner kiss her...in an intimate spot. But that didn\u2019t seem to be what Damon had in mind at all, as he had made no move to kiss her anywhere other than her breast and her lips, and now that she thought about it, that kind of kiss would be so tremendously embarrassing that she had to be wrong.</p> <p>She could feel the color creeping into her cheeks at the very thought. What if she had asked Damon to do such a thing? Not that she would have, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cRoberta,\u201d he said patiently, and her eyes flew open. \u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d</p><p>Roberta looked down at his hardened length. Just what was she supposed to do?</p><p>As if he could hear her thought, he said, \u201cYour pleasure, not mine.\u201d</p><p>Roberta was starting to feel a bit like a failure. How was she supposed to know what to do? \u201cAnd we won\u2019t do the rest of it again?\u201d She really didn\u2019t want to take another bath. It was too awful even to think of summoning her maid again.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t ask me to do.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied, she moved a fraction of an inch closer to him. \u201cBut what do you expect me to do?\u201d she said, a second later, unable to think of anything.</p><p>\u201cThink about pleasure,\u201d he said to her, his eyes slumberous and dark. \u201cWhat gives you, Roberta, pleasure about me? About my body? Is there anything? Because it\u2019s yours. You can touch me however you wish. If you tell me to do something, I will. If you don\u2019t tell me, I won\u2019t raise a finger.\u201d</p><p>A shiver went through her. \u201cGo on,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not showing Selina\u2019s tutelage to the best advantage.\u201d</p><p>Roberta bit her lip and put his teasing out of her mind. Her pleasure? And what did she particularly\u2014well, like? She had been absolutely wrong about Selina\u2019s advice, obviously, so what was Selina actually saying?</p><p>She didn\u2019t meet his eyes because she didn\u2019t want to discover he was laughing at her na\u00efvet\u00e9, after she boasted of learning so much from Selina. So she looked at his arms instead. They were broad and muscled, as unlike her slender ones as possible. She reached out a hand and placed it on his arm, slid over the bunched muscle there to the strength of his shoulder, to the breadth of his chest.</p><p>Suddenly she noticed something. He quivered under her hand. Perhaps...</p><p>She tried it again, running her hand over his muscles. Her fingers brushed his armpit and touched his nipple. He did it again. He shook, just slightly, from her touch. She scooted over on her knees so that she was just beside him and could use both her hands to touch him.</p><p>She flattened both hands on his chest, and then drew her fingers down his chest to his taut stomach. That was...pleasurable. The feeling of powerful muscle under her fingers, rippling slightly under her touch was pleasurable. The low sound that came from Damon\u2019s chest was definitely pleasurable, though she didn\u2019t look at his face. She was too busy swirling a finger around his nipple, and listening to his breathing grow short and hoarse. She was smiling now. This was what Selina meant! Selina meant that she should learn to take pleasure from her lover\u2019s body, from making him react to her touch.</p><p>His stomach was rock hard, not flat, because it was covered with organized bumps of muscle. She\u2019d never seen anything like that. Her father, as far as she could tell, had a nice flat stomach for a man coming perilously close to the age of fifty. But she\u2019d never dreamed that men had such very different stomachs from her own.</p><p>She actually glanced down at her own stomach, but her dressing gown was still firmly tied. In the sitting room, he had kissed her breast. Could Selina have meant her to do the same to him?</p><p>Finally she looked up at his face, her fingers still caressing his abdomen. Damon\u2019s face was dark and taut. There was a fierce hunger in his eyes that made her blood sing. Yes, this was pleasurable! Suddenly she knew exactly what she wanted to do: she wanted to drive him mad with desire.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know it, but the smile that touched her lips made another groan slip from Damon\u2019s lips...her smile had the slumberous joy of a woman who had just surrendered to her own sensual nature.</p><p>She bent her head and her glossy hair fell over her shoulder and brushed against his nipples. Damon\u2019s hands stayed at his sides, but he bucked his hips into the air. Roberta was so startled that she froze. Then slowly, her smile growing, she picked up a lock of hair and rubbed it over one of his nipples. \u201cRoberta!\u201d he said, and his hips arched again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cIf you sat on top of me...\u201d but she was experimenting with rubbing a little harder, and the words died in his throat.</p><p>Still, she heard what he said. \u201cWould you like that?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t leap on me, or something of that nature? Because,\u201d she felt silly telling him again, but it had to be said, \u201cI really don\u2019t wish to become messy again. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI will not do anything you don\u2019t ask me to do.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied, she pulled up the silk of her dressing gown and straddled him. He groaned out loud this time, and Roberta froze. Suddenly, she was feeling his muscles with a whole other part of her body. It made her feel feverish, hot, as if she were melting.</p><p>When he had kissed her breasts earlier in the evening\u2014it was shocking to remember it, and yet the memory sent a twist of liquid heat down to her thighs\u2014he didn\u2019t just touch her with his tongue. He suckled her, as a babe might its mother, at least so she thought. It was a strange idea and yet...She lowered her head to his chest.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t at all like being a baby. He twisted under her mouth, and made a hoarse groan, and the sound sent another wave of liquid heat down her body. So she suckled harder, and he writhed under her.</p><p>Which had the most peculiar effect on the place between her legs.</p><p>\u201cRoberta,\u201d he gasped, \u201cwould you please ask me to touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said immediately, straightening up.</p><p>His eyes were fevered with desire, but there was a lurking smile too. \u201cI can\u2019t stop moving if you do that,\u201d he said, his voice rasping.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, her fingers brushing over his nipples again, just to see what he would do.</p><p>What he did was arch up, which made him rub against...</p><p>She gasped and clutched his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNot that!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d his eyes were so disappointed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I can\u2019t stop it,\u201d he whispered achingly. \u201cWhen you touch me, Roberta, I feel mad, out of control.\u201d</p><p>That was a very pleasurable thing to hear. So Roberta kissed him again, and a groan tore from his throat and he was moving under her. That was rather pleasurable as well though not, of course, in the way that Selina was talking about.</p><p>\u201cMay I touch you?\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d But she wanted to touch more of him, even...even that part of him. So she moved backward, careful not to touch him, and sat on his legs instead.</p> <p>Damon instantly propped himself upon his elbows, watching her. That part of him was like smooth velvet, hot to the touch, jerking against her hand.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have control over it?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>He groaned. \u201cNormally I do. That was an aberration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat aberration? Look, every time I touch it, it moves.\u201d She cupped her hand around him, and he fell flat back and that hoarse sound came from his throat again.</p><p>One had to wonder, Roberta thought, what he would do if she\u2014of course, she couldn\u2019t do that. It wasn\u2019t done, she was sure. Except that she had a fragile memory of something Selina said...something about just this subject.</p><p>She\u2019d thought it was disgusting at the time, but now, looking at Damon\u2019s rigid face and the way he was breathing quickly and harshly, she rather thought that it would give her a great deal of pleasure to make him mad, as it were. Perhaps even lose control.</p><p>She tried touching her tongue to it first. It was smooth and hot on the top. Just like the rest of Damon...sleek and muscled. She actually licked it. The sound he made sounded almost like pain. She jerked up her head.</p><p>\u201cIs this wrong? Should I not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He tasted clean and slightly sweet.</p><p>\u201cI think you are designing this whole night to make me understand my limits,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>She smiled and tasted him again.</p><p>\u201cRoberta.\u201d Damon\u2019s voice was strangled, dark, coming from some deep place in his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t you want me to touch you at all?\u201d</p><p>Confused, she sat back up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is about your pleasure,\u201d he said, up on his elbows again. \u201cYours. If you\u2019d let me touch you, the way you\u2019ve touched me...\u201d</p><p>Roberta thought about that. Her body didn\u2019t have to think about it. She shivered all over instantly.</p><p>\u201cPlease? Please, Roberta, may I touch you?\u201d The aching sound in his voice made her shake even more.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>In one smooth movement, he sat up and lifted her off his legs. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell you what?\u201d</p><p>He gently pushed her backwards. \u201cTell me what would give you pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I kiss you here?\u201d He put a finger on her wrist.</p><p>That seemed acceptable. Roberta nodded. He didn\u2019t just kiss, though, he nuzzled her wrist, and licked it.</p><p>\u201cYour hand?\u201d</p><p>Something like an assent came from her throat and he was kissing each of her fingers, and then swirling his tongue around the tips of them, and even suckling them, which against all commonsense made her shiver. He pressed a kiss into her palm.</p><p>\u201cWhere next?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me, I suppose I could just make a choice for you?\u201d</p><p>There was something violent and tender in his voice that made her lose her head. \u201cHere,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Her hand touched her breast. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to untie your dressing gown. May I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBecause I could kiss you straight through the silk.\u201d His large hand pulled the frail silk taut against her breast, and there was her nipple, puckered, straining against the fabric. Roberta could feel herself turning crimson, but she was so hot it hardly mattered.</p><p>She tremblingly untied her dressing gown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as an assent,\u201d he said, a tone of deep satisfaction in his voice.</p><p>She didn\u2019t tremble or gasp when his mouth came to her breast. She shrieked. It was a small shriek, but still\u2014</p><p>Roberta clapped a hand over her mouth.</p><p>He was laughing, of course. And then kissing her again, sweet and rough, and her body arched toward him precisely as his had toward her.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, helpless in the face of delight. \u201cI...\u201d but the words slipped away from her. He was moving from one breast to the other, expert and slow. Just when she thought she couldn\u2019t bear it another moment, he would move back to the other breast, and his rough fingers would replace his lips.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Roberta said, those little screams building up in her throat until she couldn\u2019t keep silent. She couldn\u2019t\u2014</p><p>\u201cRoberta, may I kiss you in other places?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>His fingers trailed down her body. \u201cJust to demonstrate,\u201d he told her, his fingers leaving a fiery trail. \u201cI\u2019d like to kiss you here.\u201d The sweet mound of her stomach, so different from his.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Her hip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d The inside, secret curve of her upper thigh.</p><p>And finally, \u201cHere.\u201d He put a finger on her curly patch of hair and slowly, deliberately, drew it downwards.</p><p>Roberta shook like a sapling in a storm. His finger lingered, slipping deep, tutoring her body to a kind of pleasure she hadn\u2019t imagined.</p><p>\u201cRoberta?\u201d</p> <p>She sobbed in response, and he must have taken it as a yes, because a moment later he started following the path he had laid out. Roberta\u2019s mind sank into a haze of desire. His lips brushed the skin of her stomach, and she squeaked. He migrated to the curve of her hip, and his hands slipped underneath her and shaped her bottom.</p><p>\u201cHow does that feel?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She could hear the control in his voice now, the way he\u2019d taken charge. All she could do was moan. He kept his hands there but his lips went lower and now he was skating across her thigh, nipping her a little, and she was breathing in little pants...which would have been embarrassing but there wasn\u2019t a place for that emotion, not even when he pulled her legs apart and settled between them like a man dedicated to one cause.</p><p>Her pleasure.</p><p>From the moment his tongue touched her, she surrendered. He may not have known it, but Roberta was lost in a fever dream that had tongues of fire licking in her body. Her hands clenched in the sheets, she was sobbing rather than breathing, when he stopped.</p> <p>Stopped!</p><p>\u201cI forgot to ask permission to kiss you here,\u201d he said, his fingers tracing a particular sensitive spot.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she sobbed. And oh, it was coming again, she was climbing some mountain toward\u2014</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Roberta. I forgot to mention this place.\u201d His thumb brushed another sweet fold.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014yes!\u201d she cried.</p> <p>The feeling grew in her like a gathering calm before a storm. She was twisting against his hand now and gasping for air. He put a hand on her breast, and the fury broke in her blood, rolled like thunder through her legs. He didn\u2019t stop\u2014he didn\u2019t stop\u2014she arched her back and cried out, let the sweet storm roll over her again and again and again.</p><p>Slowly she opened her eyes, and Damon was above her, on his knees.</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d she said foolishly.</p><p>\u201cDid you like that?\u201d His eyes were dancing and she felt a wave of some emotion she didn\u2019t want to catalog, some emotion that made her wind her arms around his neck and pull him down into a kiss.</p><p>His hard body came against hers, and for the first time she realized that a woman\u2019s body is a perfect cradle for a man\u2019s, and that the whole silky soft warmth of her was shaped perfectly for the hardness of his.</p><p>He was there...there...\u201cRoberta,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>There was no thought of baths in her mind. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, her fingers cupping his face. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened, and he kissed her as he thrust into her...which meant that he caught her scream on his lips.</p> <p>Damon had never felt anything like this. In a life not starved for sensual encounters, he had never experienced anything like making love to Roberta. She was gripping his arms as if he were her savior in a strange land. Perhaps it felt that way to her.</p><p>He knew only that she was breathing in deep breathy sobs that brought him to the edge of control. Even without the silky clasp of her body. But if there was one thing he was going to do, it was stay in control.</p><p>And he did.</p><p>He thrust into her again, and again, and again\u2014fiercely, softly, trying this, adjusting that, listening to her squeaks, and then her cries, and finally, her pleas. When she started pleading, his proud, lovely Roberta, pleading, he put his hands on her sweet bottom and pulled her up, bringing their hips together in a volley of passion. His chest burned, and his whole body was fighting for release but he held back, guided her over the brink, watched as her eyes flew open and she clenched her hands in his hair. Watched her luscious breasts arch toward him as she rode him up, up...up.</p><p>And still he didn\u2019t lose control, though his teeth were clenched and he was panting like a stallion after a long ride.</p><p>He settled, though, let her body rest for a moment...till her eyes opened again and she smiled at him, all wonder and the shadow of joy there.</p><p>\u201cI forgot,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cForgot what?\u201d Her voice was husky; it made him pulse inside her, and he had to wage another silent battle with himself.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to show you something,\u201d he said. He slipped out of her, not without an internal groan, picked up her boneless body, flipped her over and slid her off the bed so her toes touched the ground. And came around behind her.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, startled.</p><p>And then, when he rubbed against her, slipped into her impossibly silky depths, \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Damon didn\u2019t say anything. He couldn\u2019t. It was taking every ounce of control he had to keep plunging into her while he shaped her breasts in his hands, feasted his eyes on her heart-shaped rear, counted to forty, counted to forty again, and then finally, slowly, she started moving back toward him a little bit, arching and then\u2014finally\u2014she began breathing in that little sob that he knew he would listen for his entire life.</p><p>She understood now and was pushing back at him with the same strength with which he thrust into her, giving her everything he had, until she convulsed with a little shriek.</p><p>And yet he still didn\u2019t lose control because he wanted to see her, this first time, this first real time.</p><p>So he turned her over and slid back into the place where he belonged most in the world, and simply let go. Took her mouth in a kiss that was as savage and possessive as his thrusts. Her hands twined in his hair, and he couldn\u2019t hear for the thundering sound of his own blood in his ears, so he gasped her name, thrusting again and again. Filling her; filling him, if only he\u2019d had the words for the emotion that flooded him.</p><p>The room was silent for a long time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re marrying me.\u201d His voice was deep and certain.</p><p>Roberta didn\u2019t answer. She nuzzled into the strength of his arm around her and sighed blissfully.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d he said.</p><p>But she was asleep.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>April 18</p><p>Day seven of the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>R oberta woke up alone.</p><p>She stared at the bed curtains, realizing that she ought to think about serious subjects, like her marriage to the Duke of Villiers. But she didn\u2019t want to think: she wanted to dream about Damon...about the way his large hands spanned her breasts, and then slid between her legs, and...everything else.</p><p>Until she suddenly woke up again and realized that her heart was beating fast, her breasts were tingling, and her maid would be there any moment to draw back the curtains.</p><p>She felt rather foolishly blissful. Almost poetic, in fact. Which was surprising enough to make her rethink the whole idea of poetry.</p><p>She wandered down to breakfast to find her father there, sitting beside Teddy. He looked up as she entered. \u201cMrs. Grope has gone to visit her friends at the theater,\u201d he told her. \u201cMaster Teddy is showing me his collection of rocks.\u201d</p><p>Roberta sat down beside Teddy. He had a number of small brown rocks in front of him. The dirty kind that one finds anywhere.</p><p>\u201cVery interesting,\u201d she told Teddy.</p><p>He threw her an exasperated look that was just like his father\u2019s. \u201cThe rocks aren\u2019t interesting,\u201d he told her, \u201cit\u2019s where they\u2019re from.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She peered over again and then hazarded a guess. \u201cPersia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWest Smithfield!\u201d he said triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cYes, I will have some eggs, thank you,\u201d Roberta told the footman. \u201cAnd what\u2019s interesting about West Smithfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the mermaid landed. And these rocks come from there, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Roberta said, accepting some toast as well. She felt unusually hungry.</p><p>\u201cMaster Teddy and I are thinking of going to see this mermaid,\u201d her father said. \u201cWould you like to come, dear? She\u2019s at the Smithfield Market, as Teddy says. I\u2019ve never seen a mermaid, though I\u2019ve read Homer\u2019s warning about their dangerous propensities, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe speaks in verse, Rummer says,\u201d Teddy contributed.</p><p>\u201cRummer says she speaks in verse,\u201d Roberta corrected him.</p><p>\u201cA real mermaid!\u201d Teddy\u2019s eyes were huge. \u201cI hope Papa wakes up soon. I know that he will be so excited.\u201d</p> <p>Just then Damon walked in the room. Roberta\u2019s heart sped up and she felt herself going pink. He bent to drop a kiss on Teddy\u2019s head. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in the nursery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNanny\u2019s sick as a fish,\u201d Teddy reported. \u201cShe says her stomach is turning itself inside out and\u201d\u2014he looked enraged\u2014\u201cshe says it\u2019s my fault!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d his father said, looking unsurprised as he sat down just to the left of Roberta.</p><p>The moment he sat down, even though he hardly looked at her, Damon\u2019s muscular thigh pressed against hers. Roberta took another bite of eggs. This would never do. She couldn\u2019t survive with her heart beating so quickly; she felt as hot as a housewife boiling rags.</p><p>But that\u2019s what the day was like. They set off to see the versifying mermaid, and though Damon paid her little outward attention, certainly nothing to attract her father\u2019s notice, he kept touching her. She climbed into the carriage after Teddy, and a warm hand cupped her bottom. She sat next to Damon in the carriage, and somehow his hand got trapped behind her and started to caress her back.</p><p>Smithfield Market was crowded. \u201cMostly horses here,\u201d Damon said cheerfully.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d her father said. \u201cIs this a good place for horseflesh, then? I always thought that Tattersall\u2019s was the best venue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right. Smithfield is not a good place. You\u2019ll find many an old horse with dyed hair, with an owner promising he\u2019s a yearling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d her father said, stumping ahead of them.</p><p>Roberta adjusted her parasol to keep off the sun.</p><p>\u201cCan you see the mermaid yet?\u201d Teddy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe marquess will see her first,\u201d his father said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you walk with him?\u201d</p><p>Teddy darted ahead and that very second Damon spun Roberta about and pulled her into a kiss. She gasped in surprise, his tongue slipped between her lips, and the kiss hardened. He kissed her lingeringly, possessively, as if they weren\u2019t surrounded by crowds of farmers pushing their way toward the horse auction.</p><p>\u201cAnyone can see us!\u201d she gasped a moment later, staring up at him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m making a spectacle of you,\u201d he said with a smile in his voice.</p><p>She blinked at him and then looked around. No one was showing the faintest interest in a pair of daft gentry kissing in the sunshine.</p><p>And even looking at his eyes made her feel hungry. Hungry...as if it didn\u2019t matter how people stared at her. As if\u2014</p><p>She came up on her tiptoes and kissed him.</p><p>A man pushed by them, and shouted back over his shoulders, \u201cGet yerself a bed, then!\u201d</p><p>Damon laughed, of course, but Roberta didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cI feel like kissing you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His eyes flared, but he shook his head. \u201cNo more kisses. There are spectacles and then there are spectacles. And I\u2019m wearing a French cut-away.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him, and then followed his eyes...down the front of his body. Sure enough, his coat was cut back in a beautiful arch, the better to show off the twelve pearl buttons on his waistcoat, his breeches...and something else.</p><p>Roberta opened her mouth\u2014but Teddy was on them like a tiny whirlwind. \u201cCome on,\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat are you doing? The mermaid is in a boat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA boat?\u201d Roberta said, allowing him to pull her away. \u201cBut this is land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but she has her own boat anyway.\u201d</p><p>She did, indeed, have a boat. It was a round little vessel, a boat-shaped cottage. It was painted a faded blue, with curly letters on the side that read Versifying Mermaid. A small line of people waited restlessly outside. A burly fellow was timing the line, and let another person in every few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWhere do they go?\u201d Teddy asked.</p><p>\u201cOut the back door,\u201d his father said.</p><p>Roberta was looking at the line, which consisted solely of men. \u201cDamon, go and ask that person in front if the mermaid is appropriately dressed for a young boy,\u201d she said.</p><p>Damon looked down at Teddy, dancing on one leg. \u201cYou must be joking. We couldn\u2019t leave, even if she is wearing nothing more than a fish scale on one toe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we can,\u201d she said firmly. So Damon made his way over to the guard in front.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Papa going?\u201d Teddy said. \u201cAnd where\u2019s your papa going?\u201d</p><p>Her father was standing before a tent marked Harry Hunks, Performing Bear. He turned around and beckoned. \u201cThis bear can blow a whistle and dance a jig,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Teddy was there in a second, so Roberta followed them into the cool interior of the tent. The smell of bear was overpowering, however, and she backed out directly, straight into Damon.</p><p>His arms came around her from behind. \u201cI like that,\u201d he said. He pulled her more firmly against him.</p><p>\u201cYour cut-away coat?\u201d she asked, pulling away.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things a gentleman can\u2019t control,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should have seen me when I was younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen was an interesting year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that when Miss Kendrick began sending you perfumed letters?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, a lock of hair brushing his eyes. \u201cI had absolutely no control of my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean...\u201d Her eyes slid down his front.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIf someone had even mentioned a versifying mermaid, I would have thought about mermaid breasts and been rigid for the next hour. Maybe you and I can play mermaids later?\u201d He grinned wolfishly at her.</p><p>She smiled, but said, \u201cWhat of this particular mermaid? Is she adequately clothed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d Damon said. \u201cThe man there indicated that this mermaid was pulled from the water twenty-two years ago and has been versifying ever since. He got a bit offended at the idea that she might not be proper fare for children and said that she was a vicar\u2019s daughter. Now that I doubt, but if I were a thirty-year-old mermaid, I\u2019d avail myself of some friendly seaweed. Is Teddy in there with the bear, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the smell,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>Suddenly they heard her father\u2019s voice, loud and clear through the tent flap. \u201cDo you mean to tell me, Mr. Clay, that you starve the bear if he doesn\u2019t behave?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe only misses his supper,\u201d a voice protested in reply. \u201cAnd he knows, right enough, that\u2019s he\u2019s done wrong, sir. That he does. Just like any dog. Why, I hardly ever have to take a whip\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou whip this bear?\u201d the marquess said, his voice rising to a roar.</p><p>People in line at the mermaid\u2019s tent turned their heads, and a few others drifted closer. Roberta\u2019s hand crept into Damon\u2019s, but somehow her usual feelings of mortification and shame at the fact her father was about to make a spectacle weren\u2019t creeping over her.</p><p>A second later, her father spilled out of the tent, followed by a lean, hungry-looking fellow, presumably Mr. Clay.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear the stench another moment,\u201d her father said. \u201cNot another moment. And just think what that poor bear makes of it, sir, since in the normal way of things he\u2019d be living at the top of a tall tree, smelling nothing but the blue sky!\u201d</p><p>They all reflexively looked up. \u201cI does my best,\u201d Mr. Clay bleated.</p><p>\u201cYour best isn\u2019t good enough!\u201d the marquess said. \u201cI\u2019ll have that bear, or I\u2019ll know the reason why.\u201d</p><p>Cutting off Mr. Clay\u2019s ineffectual bluster, the marquess produced a handful of guineas, and ownership of Harry Hunks passed hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll fetch him tomorrow,\u201d the marquess said. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better be at your residence with the bear, Mr. Clay, or I shall have the High Constable on you!\u201d</p> <p>Mr. Clay was looking blissfully at the guineas in his hand. \u201cI can go back home with these,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there, your lordship, and so will Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have more of those for you if you can find a cart to take Harry to my country house.\u201d</p><p>Damon leaned over and said in Roberta\u2019s ear, \u201cHow many bears do you have at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we do have a couple of deer that were supposed to be elk, but turned out to have horns glued on, a terrible weight for their poor heads, I assure you. And we have some Greenland ducks\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreenland ducks?\u201d Damon said with a crack of laughter.</p><p>\u201cHush! Papa will hear you. They are rather peculiar, and we think they\u2019re a strain of exotic chicken because they can\u2019t swim. At first papa dropped them into the lake and it was only very quick work on the part of a groom that saved their life.\u201d</p><p>Meanwhile, they had made their way back to the mermaid\u2019s boat. The marquess dropped a few coins into the guard\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pirate!\u201d Teddy said, awed.</p><p>Damon ducked his head as they went through the low door of the boat. Seated in the corner was a mermaid.</p><p>She was quite pretty, with long golden hair and a sweet face. She had a glossy green tail wrapped with a net and a few artistically placed shells. Unlike any picture he\u2019d ever seen of a siren of the deep, she wore a starched white bodice that overlapped the beginning of her tail. In fact, she looked a bit like a vicar\u2019s daughter. Except for the satin tail, of course.</p><p>Teddy marched up before her, and said, \u201cMay I ask you questions?\u201d</p><p>The mermaid nodded at Teddy and smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI will answer whatever I can,</p><p>As a daughter of the sea to a child of man.\u201d</p><p>The marquess started rocking back and forth on his heels, a sure sign of enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cAre you friends with fish?\u201d Teddy asked.</p><p>\u201cFish were my favorite boon companions,</p><p>My very best friend was a shark,</p><p>We would whip about and have great fun,</p><p>Until I was caught by His Majesty\u2019s barque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharks!\u201d Teddy said, eyes round. \u201cI thought they were the monsters of the deep, and ate everything in their path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met a shark, Oh child of the sands?</p><p>For ignorance is no excuse for those with hands.\u201d</p><p>Teddy shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet a shark,\u201d he said, coming closer.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you lived in this boat, oh daughter of the sea?\u201d the marquess asked. He had his hands clasped behind his back and he was grinning like a fool.</p><p>\u201cYour father seems to be taken by the mermaid\u2019s versifying abilities,\u201d Damon murmured to Roberta.</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d she said.</p><p>She\u2019d seen that ecstatic look on his face before. Specifically, when Selina pranced out on the stage of her traveling troupe, and when they first saw Mrs. Grope stride onto the stage in Bath.</p><p>\u201cThe memory of my watery cave grows dim,\u201d the mermaid was saying, \u201c\u2019Tis been twenty years ere I swam in the deep, Now I almost think I am growing a limb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicely put,\u201d Damon said.</p><p>The guard popped his head in and growled, \u201cTime\u2019s up. The mermaid has others waiting for her.\u201d</p><p>The marquess turned to the mermaid.</p><p>\u201cCould a gentleman\u2019s family lure a mermaid to swim,</p><p>If we arranged it so she needn\u2019t stir a fin,</p><p>Into the shallows of a tea garden for tea,</p><p>Upon the earnest request of\u2014of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, Tsk,\u201d Damon said. \u201cThat final rhyme left something to be desired, my lord.\u201d</p><p>But the mermaid dimpled and looked as if she were blushing a little. But instead of answering, interestingly enough, she looked at Roberta. She nodded toward her tail, and then toward Teddy. After a second, Roberta realized that she was asking if Teddy would be upset to learn that the mermaid did indeed have limbs.</p><p>Roberta gave her a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s so hot in here,\u201d she said, turning to Damon. \u201cI think I should like to go home. And Teddy, it\u2019s time that we said goodbye to the lovely mermaid.\u201d</p><p>Teddy bowed, very solemn. \u201cIt has been marvelous to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remind me of a shark I once knew, called Perth,\u201d she said, perfectly seriously. \u201cHe had lovely brown eyes like yours, Oh child of the earth.\u201d</p><p>Teddy bowed again and took Roberta\u2019s hand as they left through the rear. \u201cI should like to be a shark,\u201d he said, and he chattered so much on the way back to the carriage that he didn\u2019t even notice that the marquess wasn\u2019t with them until they got home.</p><p>Whereupon Roberta told him that her papa had gone to arrange for Harry Hunks to travel back home with him.</p><p>\u201cI want to see Harry Hunks again,\u201d Teddy said wistfully.</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Damon said, smiling at Roberta over his head. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>April 19</p><p>Day eight of the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>R oberta stretched, feeling a pleasurable ache in all parts of her body, and then settled down to think.</p><p>Obviously, she needed to think. She plumped up the pillows to remove the unmistakable evidence that there had been two heads sleeping in her bed and thought: the Duke of Villiers.</p><p>My fianc\u00e9.</p><p>It was rather disconcerting to realize how fickle she was.</p><p>Ellen bustled in and began darting around the room, trailing a stream of conversation.</p><p>\u201cA picnic?\u201d Roberta said, belatedly catching the word. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>It seemed that everyone was going on this picnic. \u201cNot the master, of course,\u201d Ellen said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone to his offices long ago.\u201d</p><p>Roberta thought about it. A picnic on the Fleet River sounded like a delicious way to avoid the thorny issue of her fianc\u00e9. \u201cMarvelous,\u201d she said, swinging her legs out of bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer Grace is just playing her move with the Duke of Villiers,\u201d Ellen said.</p><p>Roberta froze. \u201cIs the duke accompanying us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Ellen said, giving her a warm smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t miss it. He enquired for you yesterday, but you were off with the mermaid. What Master Teddy hasn\u2019t told us about that mermaid!\u201d</p><p>The picnic involved not just one flat-bottomed boat, but a whole fleet of them. Roberta climbed into a boat without any difficulty, and Teddy clambered next to her, taking it for granted that the two of them would sit together.</p> <p>\u201cI have a great deal to tell you,\u201d he said. \u201cI talked to Rummer all morning and\u2014this will really interest you, Lady Roberta\u2014I discovered what a bog-trotting croggie is!\u201d</p><p>Jemma almost had to have a boat to herself, given the width of her panniers, and there were a few screams when the Duke of Villiers\u2019s cane caught on the side of the boat and he fell directly into Jemma\u2019s lap.</p><p>Roberta had a difficult time keeping her mind on the question of bogs and croggies, because it seemed to her that Villiers took a long time to disentangle himself from Jemma\u2019s lap. In fact, Roberta couldn\u2019t help wondering where her fianc\u00e9 spent the night. Did his chess game shift to something more intimate?</p><p>Mrs. Grope climbed into the boat rather grimly; she was intent on telling the company at large that she was used to large pleasure boats, such as those the Prince of Wales traveled in, though Roberta doubted very much that Mrs. Grope had ever been on a boat at the same time as the prince.</p><p>\u201cWe played a lovely game of charades aboard His Majesty\u2019s yacht,\u201d she could hear her telling her father. \u201cWhy, the girls and I were talking about it last night in the green room...\u201d She looked wistfully into the distance.</p> <p>Damon settled himself opposite and met her eyes with a grin. \u201cDollymop charades,\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>Roberta couldn\u2019t help giggling. The world was a beautiful place when one was going boating with a lovely, loose-limbed man, who had done such delicious things the night before...She even felt a flash of approval for Villiers and his idea that chastity was an antiquated notion. He was right!</p><p>She gave Villiers a huge smile, boat to boat. He seemed rather taken aback, but nodded.</p><p>\u201cToo demonstrative,\u201d Damon observed. \u201cYou can\u2019t go smiling at your fianc\u00e9 like that. Smiles, words...those are for ordinary mortals. The two of you should communicate only in nods.\u201d</p><p>She turned her nose up at his silliness.</p><p>Teddy was eager to talk about a Mr. Swarthy, who often wears brown paper pinned to his white silk stockings. \u201cDo you know why that is, Lady Roberta?\u201d</p> <p>Teddy had an endearing earnestness about him. His chin was really adorable. It was tiny with a little dimple that mimicked his father\u2019s. \u201cI don\u2019t have any idea,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t pin brown paper to my legs; would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does it in bad weather,\u201d Teddy reported. \u201cAnd he also sings \u2018Fair Dorinda\u2019 in the coffeehouse, and they don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>They were drifting down the river. The river was more dappled and green today, sleepy in the sunshine.</p><p>\u201cThe water sounds like babies talking,\u201d Teddy said.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to be a novelist,\u201d Roberta told him, listening for the little sleepy murmurs of watery babies.</p><p>He beamed and slipped a damp hand into her gloved one. Roberta looked down at his plump fingers and then pulled off her gloves and picked up his hand again.</p><p>Mrs. Grope was squealing because a family of ducks was following their boat. For a moment she couldn\u2019t see what was happening, and then she realized that her father had raided the picnic hamper and was dropping cucumber sandwiches into the water.</p><p>Jemma and Villiers weren\u2019t even looking at the water; Villiers had a piece of paper and they were scribbling with a pencil and talking. As she watched, Jemma snatched the paper back and wrote something on it.</p> <p>Damon followed her glance. \u201cWorking out a chess game,\u201d he said. \u201cJemma\u2019s chamber is always filled with pieces of paper covered with imaginary games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth do you write out a chess game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a series of chicken scrawls,\u201d he explained. \u201cBK4, for example, means that someone moved his bishop to King\u2019s Four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to swim today?\u201d Teddy enquired.</p><p>\u201cYou are going to swim,\u201d his father said. \u201cPhillips, who is poling the boat with the marquess in it, was kind enough to offer to take you in the water. We\u2019ll drop you off at the mud flats.\u201d</p><p>Teddy whooped with joy, and in the resulting m\u00eal\u00e9e he rocked their boat so much that it would have fallen over except for its wide bottom. A few minutes later they handed him off to a cheerful-looking footman.</p><p>\u201cShall we follow the river all the way to the end today?\u201d Roberta enquired, when Damon settled back into the boat. It had been easy when Teddy was with them, but now she felt prickly and strange because they were alone...alone except for a footman and the cheerful voice of her father in the boat just in front of them. He was reciting a poem that had to do with fish and fins.</p><p>Damon sprawled next to her, all easy grace and muscle, and didn\u2019t answer, just picked up her ungloved hand. His thumb played a tune on her wrist, and his touch, that little touch, turned her blood to liquid gold. She couldn\u2019t even look at him, so she looked straight ahead, at the way the shadows flowed over the side of the boat, reflecting off the water in pale sparks of light.</p><p>She was wearing a gown of cherry muslin, one of those sewn by Mrs. Parthnell, which meant it was of very simple construction and had no hoops. Her hair was tied up and fell in ringlets; she had blackened her eyelashes. She had never felt prettier in her life.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do all day?\u201d she asked impulsively. She wanted to know everything about him: what he ate for breakfast, and what he named his mare, and where he met his friends.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m not making love to you?\u201d His voice was low, so the footman couldn\u2019t hear it.</p><p>But a flush struck her face as if she had a sunburn. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, and the low sound of it made her feel breathless. \u201cI own a great deal of property.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, trying to fix her mind on property. Of course he did. It was like her father\u2019s eleven peach trees: Damon would have some peach trees of his own. After all, he was an earl. The thought slipped away from her mind and was replaced by a memory of the night before, a memory of how smooth and hot he felt in her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cI never could make myself care about chess pieces, but I do like to play with money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, and peeked at him.</p><p>A slow smile curved one side of his mouth. \u201cWhy do I think that you are uninterested in my financial pastimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am interested,\u201d she said hastily. But she could feel pink spreading down her bodice. Down to the drawstring that awkwardly separated her bodice from her skirts.</p><p>\u201cIf you look at me like that,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t not look. His green eyes fascinated her. A mere glance from him caused a tender warmth between her legs to blossom. She wanted to giggle\u2014and gasp.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d he said, and the back of his hand touched her cheek for a moment. Then he stretched, his arms suddenly flashing up into the air. But the footman behind them was balanced on the small platform at the back of the boat, wielding the great pole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before Roberta could blink there was a flash of crimson livery and a splash. Cool water dashed the boat, hit the muslin roof, sprinkled her dress. She yelped, but Damon was already standing, leaning over the side.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t pull you in or we\u2019ll go over,\u201d he was shouting to the footman, who was treading water and pushing sodden hair from his forehead. \u201cBest make your way to shore and go back to the house.\u201d</p><p>The footman gurgled something that sounded like an assent, and managed to maneuver the pole into Damon\u2019s hands. He leaped onto the small platform and pushed the boat forward again.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you knew how to do that,\u201d Roberta said, changing places so that she was facing Damon, sitting with her back to the current. He was poling the boat forward with long smooth strokes.</p> <p>\u201cPush footmen in the river, or punt?\u201d</p><p>She was laughing so hard she couldn\u2019t breathe. The two other boats, now far ahead of them, turned around a corner of the river and vanished altogether. \u201cDid we arrange a spot to meet them?\u201d she enquired.</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She watched his smooth, powerful movements as he poled the boat.</p><p>\u201cDamon, who is Teddy\u2019s mother?\u201d she asked suddenly. \u201cI know why you took him in...but who was the grandmother who brought him to you? Is he the child of your mistress?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a mistress,\u201d he said, shaking back a lock of hair that had fallen over his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t had one for the past five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Teddy is just five, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Teddy is six. I pensioned my mistress after Teddy came to my house, and no, she wasn\u2019t his mother.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you who his mother is,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI promised I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Roberta said, disappointed. \u201cI am very good at keeping secrets.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled the pole from the water and an arch of water drops flew like shining diamonds back to the water. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my wife, of course,\u201d he said conversationally.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Roberta said again. But the word sounded different in her mouth this time.</p><p>There was a bump and she squealed. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone aground,\u201d she cried, adding hastily, \u201cnot that I mean it as a criticism.\u201d They had scooted right under the vast sheltering branches of a willow tree hanging over the edge of the bank and trailing its boughs in the water. Dappled light slid through the boughs, covering the boat with the shadows of the willow\u2019s slender spear-leaves.</p><p>Damon drove the pole deeply into the bottom of the river, and then he slung a rope over it.</p><p>Roberta didn\u2019t say a word. In fact, the whole lazy river seemed to hold its breath. She couldn\u2019t hear a sound other than the dull and smothered voice of the water, and somewhere, a lark singing.</p><p>\u201cOur boat,\u201d Damon said, with a glance so suggestive that she felt herself grow even pinker, \u201chas run aground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame. I may have to undress in order to save us from sinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He pulled off his coat.</p><p>Roberta could feel giggles rising inside her, faster than the bubbles rising from the bottom of the river. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she enquired.</p><p>\u201cUndressing.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sang to her in some language that she had just learned, but seemed to know instinctively.</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t you better follow suit?\u201d he said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI?\u201d Roberta said. \u201cI? Undress in a public river, in a flat-bottomed boat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe grateful it\u2019s not another kind of boat,\u201d Damon said, sitting down on the little platform and pulling off his boots.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t really mean it,\u201d Roberta said, feeling very sure that he did mean it. \u201cAnyone might happen by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense! Almost no one travels this river, since it goes nowhere. We\u2019re tied up to yet another cow pasture. This one has actual cows, and one must assume, fresher cowpats. It is, therefore, unlikely to host picnickers as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpeccable logic,\u201d she murmured. He pulled off his shirt. He was all sleek muscle, dappled by leaves, dusted golden by the sun, strong...</p><p>She reached out without even realizing and then froze again. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d she cried. \u201cWhat if someone saw us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will,\u201d he said and his voice was as potent as brandy. He was beside her now, throwing cushions onto the floor of the boat. But he took his time unlacing her gown, and after a time she fell into the sweetness of the shaded little room they had found under the willow.</p><p>\u201cI suppose,\u201d she whispered, \u201cif we sit on the floor no one could see below our waists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we lie down, they can\u2019t see anything at all. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s done all the time?\u201d He waited for her answer, eyebrow raised.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said, with half a gasp because her dress was gone and he didn\u2019t seem to be bothering to remove her stays, his hands were running up her legs seeking that sweet spot, and she was arching toward him.</p><p>He lay down in the boat and pulled her toward him. She gave up the battle\u2014what battle?\u2014and fell on him with a little cry as her softness came onto his hardness, his muscles, his demands. He was unlacing her stays while he kissed her, deep and hard, and she couldn\u2019t help squirming against him, gasping against his lips.</p><p>One of his hands was between her legs, playing a rhythm that matched the sound of the water. She didn\u2019t even feel out of doors. It was as if her small cries and the deep sounds he made when she touched him were swallowed into the vast stillness of the watery afternoon, leaving their small boat as enclosed and private as a walled room. Just the lark broke its invisible walls as he kept singing, spiraling higher and higher into the sky.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he commanded, his mouth finding her waiting, taut nipple.</p><p>She cried out and her hands flew blindly about his body, touching him here and there, the smooth curve of a shoulder, the rippled muscles on his back. She couldn\u2019t concentrate though, not when he was doing that, so she simply let her body twist against his, begging.</p><p>\u201cNow touch me,\u201d he said later, his voice thick.</p><p>He said it twice, and the meaning of it crept through her smoky brain, made her open her eyes and look down at him. \u201cYou want me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch me. I love it when you touch me, Roberta. No one has ever felt as you do.\u201d His eyes were so dark that they weren\u2019t even green any longer; they looked black in the dappled light.</p><p>Roberta reared back, back onto her knees and looked down at him. He lay before her, like a great feast. The wood of the boat was dark brown, rubbed smooth by years. Damon lay there like a figure carved from marble, warm and golden: long powerful thighs, a flat stomach, a chest that swelled into muscles. She started there, with a fingertip, just touching.</p><p>She knelt over him, careful, her hands slipping from one set of muscles to another. He shivered when she stroked his chest, groaned aloud when she touched him with her tongue. She sat back, looking down\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI can\u2019t survive that, not in a boat.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, all the laughter inside her spilling out. She was kneeling in a boat, wearing a chemise that was made of fine lawn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow touch yourself,\u201d he said, following her glance down to her chest.</p><p>She colored. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>His grin was the grin of a sweet devil. \u201cWhere you\u2019d like me to touch you.\u201d And when she hesitated, \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 35</p> <p>T he two boats carrying Jemma and Villiers and the marquess and Mrs. Grope poled their way along the drowsy stream. Jemma and Villiers paid no attention to the water whatsoever. Lord Wharton was composing a simple little ditty, along these lines:</p><p>All along the River Fleet,</p><p>Through the rushes green,</p><p>Swans are a-dabbling,</p><p>Up tails all!</p> <p>He didn\u2019t pretend that it was a great work of literature. But it had a pretty rhythm and he knew a certain mermaid who might think it was interesting. He sang it to himself, and sang it to Mrs. Grope, and sang it again, and then set to work on another verse.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the poem had grown to some six stanzas, and included ducks, drakes, minnows and swifts, that he realized that his daughter was missing. Moreover...she was missing with that charming brother of the duchess. The earl who had quoted back a line of his poetry, and had a clear look about his eye.</p><p>That brother.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t said anything at the fair yesterday, but he wasn\u2019t blind. He saw exactly how the duchess\u2019s brother looked at his daughter.</p><p>The marquess may be mad (at least to unrefined minds) but no one could accuse him of being stupid. It was the work of a moment to stand up and roar so loudly that the boat just ahead of them, and indeed, everyone on the bank as well, paid instant attention.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter!\u201d he roared. \u201cShe\u2019s been abducted!\u201d</p> <p>Now you may think that there was nothing but cows to hear the marquess\u2019s howl of parental distress, but in fact, he was lucky. The boats had gone so far along the river that one of those pleasure gardens stretching to the very bank belonged to a Mrs. Trimmer, sometimes known as Selina, now known as the prince\u2019s delicious tidbit (when she wasn\u2019t playing lead roles at Drury Lane).</p><p>Selina leapt to her feet the moment she heard that familiar bellow. She and the Prince of Wales were lying on the grass, recovering after a bounteous luncheon al fresco. The prince had had three bottles of champagne, and Selina was considering, rather sadly, that he was probably no longer fit for an afternoon dance in the sheets, and yet she was due at the theater in less than two hours.</p><p>\u201cMarcus!\u201d she cried, running down to the water.</p><p>Behind her, the prince stumbled to his feet like a water buffalo emerging from a pleasant mud bath. \u201cWhat! Ho!\u201d he said, waving his arms. Three footmen chased each other down the lawn toward him and steadied him on his feet.</p><p>Meanwhile, Selina ran straight out onto the dock to which was tied her pretty little craft, the Selina. It had been given to her by an adoring theatergoer who hoped that a large gift would make inroads in her affection. But Selina had been loved by the best, and she no longer considered economics when choosing her bed partners. Lord Wharton had taught her that.</p><p>\u201cMarcus!\u201d she shrieked, dancing up and down at the end of the wharf. \u201cIt is you! Oh, what are you doing in London and on the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for my daughter!\u201d the marquess roared back. \u201cSelina, my love!\u201d He waved his arms at her.</p><p>Selina was still hopping up and down as Prince George appeared, accompanied by a whole throng of footmen. \u201cWhat, ho!\u201d he shouted.</p> <p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Lord Wharton shouted back.</p><p>\u201cIn the boat!\u201d Selina screamed. \u201cSome villain has abducted Lord Wharton\u2019s daughter. We must go immediately.\u201d</p><p>The prince scrambled into Selina\u2019s boat followed by a flock of footmen. \u201cPole it lively!\u201d he shouted at them. \u201cSome of you swim over to those other two boats and make them move at a fine clip.\u201d</p><p>Without a second\u2019s hesitation four footmen plunged into the water and swam over to the boats. There was a bit of unruly rocking as they clambered aboard Lord Wharton\u2019s boat, especially when one of them had to swim back to Selina\u2019s boat to get some paddles, but finally all three boats were going downstream at a fine clip.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her for you!\u201d Selina screamed. \u201cLittle Roberta!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know the marquess well?\u201d the prince enquired, a note of disapproval in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI was the nursemaid to his delightful child, Roberta,\u201d Selina said. \u201cAh, the sweet days of my innocent youth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are as youthful as a rose now,\u201d Prince George said gallantly. He was looking a wee bit green in the face from the unfortunate rocking of the boat. But he was holding up well, under the circumstances. Selina tucked herself next to his considerable bulk and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat would we do without our monarch to save us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d he roared.</p><p>Jolted out of a lively discussion of the worst blunders they\u2019d ever made in a game, Jemma nor Villiers said a word as their boat was efficiently turned about by dripping footmen and sent whipping down the river.</p><p>Finally Villiers said, \u201cI believe that this is what they call an Act of God.\u201d</p><p>Jemma looked over and saw he was smiling. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that anything happened to Roberta and Damon, do you? Or to little Teddy?\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s lower lip drooped for a moment. \u201cForgot the child.\u201d Then he brightened. \u201cThey must have dropped him off somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamon did say that Teddy was learning to swim.\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s smile was that of a man with a new belief in deities.</p><p>Somewhat farther down the river, and thankfully still around the curve and out of sight, Damon pulled Roberta\u2019s gown over her head and laced her up in the front. \u201cI feel boneless,\u201d she sighed. \u201cThat was lovely.\u201d A second later, she slid her feet into her slippers, and pinned her hair back, though without the aid of a mirror, it undoubtedly looked a fright. \u201cWhat shall we do now? I wonder where my father is?\u201d</p><p>At that very moment three boats careened around the far corner, tearing toward them. But they were still far away, and the graceful branches of the willow tree blunted sound, so Damon pulled on his breeches and his boots in happy ignorance.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d Roberta asked.</p><p>Damon swung around, causing the boat to rock violently. But they had both gained a certain adroitness in handling unsteady craft in the last hour, and neither fell into the water. \u201cBloody hell,\u201d he said, and snatched up his shirt.</p><p>But he barely had it billowing over his head before Lord Wharton\u2019s boat was upon them.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d Roberta gasped. \u201cThat\u2019s my father and Villiers\u2014who\u2019s following in that boat?\u201d</p><p>From his standing position, Damon had a better view than did Roberta. A man naturally feels cheerful when royalty and fate step in to take care of fussy little problems, such as Villiers. He pulled the pole from the mud and gave their boat a great heave.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Roberta moaned, as the prow swept through the long green branches and the third boat came squarely into view. \u201cWho is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Prince of Wales,\u201d Damon said, laughing like a man possessed.</p><p>The marquess was standing in the front of his boat like a rather plump figurehead, his arms crossed and a terrible scowl on his face. \u201cUnhand my daughter, you villain!\u201d he shouted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roberta moaned again.</p><p>Damon saw immediately that his future father-in-law was enjoying himself hugely. \u201cDisplaying his considerable skills in melodrama,\u201d he muttered to Roberta, \u201cthe enraged peer advances, blood in his eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood in his eye?\u201d Roberta cried. And then: \u201cSelina!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought it of you, Gryffyn,\u201d His Majesty said, standing up. Two footmen quickly moved into a position to catch him should he topple toward the river.</p> <p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d Damon said, \u201cI was overcome by her beauty.\u201d</p><p>Roberta buried her face in her hands. She was overcome by humiliation.</p><p>\u201cYou shall pay for your impetuous folly,\u201d the marquess said with magnificent emphasis. \u201cYou shall marry her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want nothing less,\u201d Damon said, looking down at Roberta.</p><p>Villiers decided that was his cue. \u201cI relinquish my claim to Lady Roberta\u2019s hand,\u201d he announced. \u201cShe is free to wed whomever she pleases.\u201d</p> <p>There was a slight diversion when Mrs. Grope realized who was in the boat next to her. She too rose to her feet, wobbling with the excitement of the moment and managed a deep curtsy, panniers and all. \u201cYour Majesty,\u201d she cried. \u201c\u2019Tis I!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless me,\u201d Prince George said, peering at her. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that\u2019s pretty little Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA more charming Desdemona you never saw,\u201d he told Selina, who appeared to have divined the reason why Mrs. Grope was in the marquess\u2019s boat, and wasn\u2019t looking too happy about it. \u201cYou must all come back to the house and celebrate the nuptial couple!\u201d</p><p>Villiers stood up and bowed, effortlessly holding his balance in his boat. \u201cI fear my dismay would dampen the festivities,\u201d he said. \u201cWith your permission, Your Majesty, I shall return to my house.\u201d</p><p>The prince appeared to notice he was there for the first time. \u201cDismay?\u201d he said. \u201cDampen? What are you talking about, Villiers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe duke thought to marry my daughter,\u201d Lord Wharton said, unable to stop smiling now the engagement was safely over.</p><p>\u201cYou did, eh, Villiers? I didn\u2019t think you were in the marital line,\u201d His Majesty said. \u201cNever mind. Better to stay a bachelor. Look how much fun I\u2019m having!\u201d He roared with laughter, and then sobered. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to challenge you to a game of chess one of these days. I\u2019ve got the hook of the sport now and I win almost every match. I\u2019m ready to take you on.\u201d</p><p>Villiers bowed again. \u201cIt would be my greatest pleasure.\u201d Then, as the prince settled his bulk back into Selina\u2019s boat, he turned to Jemma. \u201cWould you like to join the others for the celebration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, I would like to congratulate my brother, so I will take up His Majesty\u2019s kind invitation.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cI would feel worse for you, Villiers, if I didn\u2019t suspect that you will break out champagne when you get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to assuage my misery,\u201d he assured her. \u201cAnd perhaps to dull the thought of that chess game I just agreed to. Sometimes it\u2019s harder to fix a loss than to win.\u201d</p><p>The royal footmen nimbly maneuvered Villiers\u2019s boat next to Selina\u2019s, and with a minimum of squeaks, Jemma made her way on board and sat down next to the prince, who seemed very happy to meet the lovely Duchess of Beaumont.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard much about you,\u201d he said, \u201cand all of it good!\u201d</p><p>Jemma had no doubt but that her reputation was a cause for celebration to this particular future king.</p> <p>Without further ado, the two boats powered by footmen started to plow through the water, back upstream, while the boat carrying the Duke of Villiers headed the other way, to the steps.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dally, Roberta!\u201d the marquess shouted, hands cupped around his mouth, looking back at his daughter\u2019s boat.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see him. In fact, all that could be seen of her were scarlet ears, peeking out from behind her hands.</p><p>There was a moment or two of silence as the boats receded in both directions.</p><p>Damon tucked his shirt back into his breeches and pulled on his coat. Roberta still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>He pulled up the pole, maneuvered the boat back under the willow with one great shove, and then tethered the boat again. Finally he sat down before her.</p><p>\u201cRoberta, you\u2019re going to have to look up at some point,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d Her voice was muffled by her hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never proposed before,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be easier if I could see your face. That way if you look disgusted I can quickly throw myself off the boat and end it now.\u201d</p><p>Her hands dropped. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be melodramatic!\u201d she cried. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it at the moment.\u201d Her face was distinctly pink and her eyes were shining with unshed tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just fooling.\u201d He reached out and took her hands. \u201cAre you crying because Villiers is lost to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not crying,\u201d she said, all evidence to the contrary.</p><p>In one smooth gesture, he slid forward onto his knees. \u201cRoberta, will you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already told me that you were marrying me,\u201d she said, with a sniff.</p><p>He put one of her hands up to his mouth. \u201cBut this is a proper proposal. I decided to marry you about twenty minutes after we met, and I\u2019ve waited a long time for this.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cOf course, you were nattering on about Villiers, so I couldn\u2019t make it plain to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberta, love, do you really think that I would take your virginity\u2014and make love to you every chance I could get\u2014without planning to marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was engaged...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were toying with the idea,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, you were surrendering to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurrendering?\u201d</p><p>Her hands were at his mouth again. \u201cSurrender,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Roberta. Mine.\u201d He could see a glimmer of a smile in her eyes, so he pulled her forward into his arms. Which made the boat rock rather violently, but neither of them even flinched.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see that I surrendered,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her mouth was so pink and delectable that he forgot his point for a while, and only returned to the subject some time later. \u201cWhat did you think you were doing?\u201d he asked, his mouth sliding down her neck.</p><p>\u201cI was\u2014I was\u2014\u201d</p><p>Now that he mentioned it, Roberta couldn\u2019t remember quite what she was doing. Villiers made her angry and so she decided to lose her virginity...It sounded so foolish. \u201cI was gaining experience,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>\u201cYou were surrendering to me. You just didn\u2019t want to think of it that way,\u201d he said, even more firmly. He cupped her face in his hands. \u201cSo, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I marry you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou are marrying me. Will you surrender?\u201d</p><p>She put her arms around his neck and those foolish tears were back in her eyes. \u201cI think,\u201d she whispered, \u201cthat I already did.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>H e was free, obviously a reason for rejoicing. The moment the boat poled back to the Fleet River steps, Villiers sprang out. His heel slipped on the slimy step; he teetered; he fell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>On his bottom.</p><p>Behind him he heard a grunt of distress from his footman, who lurched forward to rescue the poor forsaken duke who had slipped in the muck. But Villiers was already up.</p><p>The fall made the rage brewing in his stomach burst into flame. He made his way home, stripped off the coat smeared with green moss and black mud, bathed and dressed again for the evening.</p><p>It occurred to him as he pulled on tight breeches of a glorious canary that without noticing it and certainly without approving it, he had fallen into the way of thinking of himself as a man about to be married. For all of forty-eight hours, he scoffed to himself.</p> <p>His valet eased a coat of saturated rose over his shoulders; he rejected it as clashing with the breeches. The man brought a waistcoat of mustard yellow, and Villiers actually swore at him. Finally he settled on a full-cut frock coat with his trademark exuberant embroidery: a tracing of leaves and yellow roses. It was, perhaps, just a trifle too exuberant, but it had an aggressiveness that pleased.</p><p>The valet cleared his throat rather nervously. \u201cBoots, Your Grace? Or the shoes with silver buckles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed heels,\u201d Villiers snapped. \u201cI\u2019m to Parsloe\u2019s and then to dinner with Lord Devonshire. I can hardly tramp about in boots.\u201d Rather than his cane, he chose a proper little rapier, designed to swing at his hip. Finally he placed a patch high, just below his eye where it would emphasize his lashes.</p><p>He swept a cold look around his chamber, a muddle of rejected coats, cravats, shoes, ribbons spilling from his drawer. \u201cDo make yourself useful and neaten this up,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI have a mind to bring someone home later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bloody animal he is tonight,\u201d his valet said later, in the kitchen with a soothing cup of tea. \u201cAs if I didn\u2019t always neaten up. I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what\u2019s got into him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe lady\u2019s rejected \u2019im,\u201d Cook said, wiping her hands on her apron. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you an apple tart next Tuesday that she\u2019s turned him down flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that because he\u2019s bringing home a dollymop?\u201d</p><p>She had a sound of disgust. \u201cNothing to do with it. He\u2019s in a foul mood, he is. And he\u2019s not over at Beaumont House, is he? He\u2019s been there for three days running. Mark my words: he\u2019s back on the market again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he ever was on the market,\u201d the valet said dubiously.</p><p>\u201cCould be he\u2019s not a marrying man,\u201d Cook concluded. \u201cI\u2019d best make up some bits and pieces for entertaining a ladyfriend tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot rid of his mistress and all last week,\u201d the valet said mournfully. \u201cAnd now the wife drops him. That\u2019s cruel, that is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot his wife yet, and that\u2019s a blessing in itself,\u201d Cook said. She had firm views about matrimony, and one could not describe them as positive. \u201cOut of the way, will you? I can\u2019t put a hand on my sugar.\u201d</p><p>Parsloe\u2019s, like any organization of its ilk, was ruled by the unspoken hierarchy structuring the members of the London Chess Club. Brilliance ruled. Chess is an odd and unlikely sport: it taxes the brains and the heart at the same time. Even a poor player might sometimes make a beautiful play, or stump a master, and thus the hierarchy is never set in stone. Only at the very top is it unassailable.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s carriage pulled up at precisely eight o\u2019clock. It was a delicious little carriage, as sleek and beautiful as its master: painted a dark crimson, and picked out in brazen orange accents.</p><p>The door was snatched open by the duke\u2019s footman; three others joined in, standing before the door, backs straight, liveries immaculate.</p><p>One red heel emerged from the carriage, followed by a powerful, muscled thigh clad in canary colored breeches. The duke wore, as usual, not a touch of powder. He walked to the door of the large townhouse that served as the chess club\u2019s headquarters without looking to the left or the right.</p><p>As he climbed the stairs, a footman swept open the front door. Inside, he handed his hat to one, and his cape to another.</p><p>\u201cI shall keep my sword,\u201d he said to Parsloe, who was bowing. \u201cI am not in the mood for killing tonight.\u201d</p><p>The rules of the chess club insisted on no weapons, but what could Parsloe say? The duke ruled. And not because of his title, either.</p> <p>Villiers strolled into the main room, knowing that anger was burning within him like a slow coal, and rather relishing the pure stupidity of it. He didn\u2019t want the girl, never really wanted the girl, and now he was angry because he no longer had her? Such is the foolishness of men.</p><p>Lord Woodword Jourdain looked up when he came in. \u201cVilliers!\u201d he cried. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time to try my new chess game.\u201d</p><p>Villiers strolled to his side and looked down at the cacophony of pieces. \u201cHow many pieces in this version, Jourdain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-eight,\u201d Jourdain said eagerly. \u201cTen rows and fourteen columns. I had to make up a special board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis piece?\u201d Villiers put a beautifully manicured forefinger on a piece.</p><p>\u201cThe concubine,\u201d Jourdain said.</p><p>\u201cAn errant piece, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly held in check by two additional bishops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrowned rooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d Villiers said, turning away. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of females, concubines or otherwise...they are all so tiresome, are they not?\u201d</p><p>Jourdain huffed in annoyance, but Viscount St. Albans looked up. \u201cDo tell,\u201d he said with his usual lisp. \u201cHas true love tarnished so quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, what is love?\u201d Villiers said. The only person sitting before an unattended chessboard was Lord Gordon. \u201cA game, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a rook advantage,\u201d Villiers said gently.</p><p>Lord Gordon\u2019s face showed no response at all to this insult, merely a bovine gratitude, and Villiers felt his temper slip a notch higher.</p><p>\u201cWhat is love, \u2019tis not hereafter,\u201d St. Albans said. \u201cI believe that\u2019s Shakespeare, but even so, Your Grace, your experience of love must have been remarkably brief. It\u2019s been no more than a day since I heard you were engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give you the joy, St. Albans, of being the first to know that I am no longer engaged,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cAt least try a few of the pieces,\u201d Jourdain said, suddenly appearing at his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve no idea how interesting it makes the game, Villiers. Take the concubine.\u201d He plumped the piece down in the middle of the board. \u201cHere\u2019s another for you, Gordon. She moves all directions, of course, just like the queen. Her special touch is that she can take two men in a row, but she never takes the king or the queen.\u201d He giggled madly. \u201cShe\u2019s not that sort of concubine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gordon\u2019s pink lips flapped like a fish on the dock, Villiers decided. \u201cWe can\u2019t play with a piece like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou play with pieces like that all the time,\u201d Villiers said sweetly. \u201cThat was you I glimpsed with Mrs. Rutland the other night?\u201d</p><p>Gordon was rearranging his pieces and didn\u2019t look up. Villiers could only hope that he remembered where they all went.</p><p>\u201cThe concubine goes in front of the king\u2019s rook,\u201d Jourdain instructed. \u201cShe\u2019s on her knees already, you understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t that he wished to marry. But there had been something interesting about the last few days, during which he felt part of something\u2014of a family, one had to suppose. Yet what a family? Who would want to tie himself to that ridiculous marquess? Clearly, the man felt the same about him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to play with this piece,\u201d Gordon said, jutting out his lip. \u201cI\u2019ve a good shot at winning with a rook advantage. This piece will just mess it all up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcubines always do,\u201d St. Albans said. He had pulled over a chair. \u201cYou should watch out for Mrs. Rutland, Gordon. Her husband was swearing to revenge his horns the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have a pretty time deciding which man to challenge,\u201d Villiers said idly. He hadn\u2019t really decided whether to play with the concubine. On the one hand, it was a silly piece. On the other, it would irritate Gordon and Lord knows why he had sat down in front of the moribund fool.</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Rutland is a praiseworthy woman,\u201d Gordon said.</p><p>\u201cWell, you should know,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou may begin, Gordon.\u201d He placed his concubine in front of his king\u2019s rook. \u201cQuite a brave little piece, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can turn the entire game,\u201d Jourdain said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no doubt. Your move, Gordon.\u201d</p><p>Gordon pushed forward a pawn and said with his customary obstinacy, \u201cMrs. Rutland is no concubine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one said she is,\u201d Villiers said. It was his move and he decided to try out the concubine by taking one of Gordon\u2019s pawns and then his king\u2019s rook. Why not?</p><p>Gordon breathed heavily through his nose in a revolting manner. \u201cLook here, Jourdain,\u201d he said, \u201chow can we play a proper game with that dreadful concubine going about and sweeping up pieces right and left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo true to life,\u201d Villiers said thoughtfully. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought you capable of it, Jourdain.\u201d</p><p>Jourdain turned a little pink. \u201cGo on, Gordon,\u201d he urged. \u201cJust think it through, man.\u201d</p><p>Gordon was incapable of thinking anything through, including his relations with Mrs. Rutland. \u201cYou might want to turn the lock next time you decide to shed your breeches in public,\u201d Villiers said, just when he considered that Gordon might be actually concentrating on a move. \u201cYour wife would have been most distressed to walk into the sitting room and see you rutting away like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRutting Rutland,\u201d the viscount said with a simpering laugh, showing that he was ever a man who had to say the obvious.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care for your phrasing,\u201d Gordon stated, looking up at Villiers.</p><p>Villiers felt a lazy spur of interest. Finally the great walrus was listening to him. \u201cBut rutting is such an evocative phrase,\u201d he complained.</p><p>Gordon pushed back his chair with a scraping noise, shocking in the small room.</p><p>Parsloe rushed forward. \u201cMy lords, may I remind you of the rules of the London Chess Club? Physical interaction of any kind and the participants lose their membership.\u201d</p><p>Gordon paused. Villiers could almost see the cogs turning in his head. Finally he pulled back to the table and said, \u201cAt least I didn\u2019t almost marry her.\u201d</p><p>Villiers lifted his eyes from the chessboard very slowly. \u201cSince I gather you are unlikely to be talking about your virtuous wife, would you like to clarify yourself?\u201d</p><p>Gordon bent over, huffing a little, and swept his concubine forward to take a pawn, followed by one of Villiers\u2019s bishops. \u201cAfter I left Mrs. Rutland at the ball, I happened into the library. My guess would be that you, Villiers, have lost your fianc\u00e9e to the Earl of Gryffyn. Of course, I would never soil a lady\u2019s reputation by saying anything about...rutting.\u201d</p><p>Villiers knew quite well that the wave of rage he felt was unfair and improper. It was just that if Gordon saw Roberta in the library with Gryffyn\u2014that would be before he asked her to marry him, before he told her to lose her chastity, before he decided to end their engagement. At the very moment she was doing her best to lure him to the point.</p> <p>There are times when irrational feelings are insuppressible. He felt sick. That was it\u2014sick. He looked up to find St. Albans\u2019s avid little eyes fixed on him like a pig spotting a rotten apple. Albans was watching for the slightest trace of emotion, he knew. He\u2019d be damned if he allowed anyone to think that he cared.</p><p>\u201cQueens are so unstable,\u201d he said sweetly. \u201cThey careen across the board, and sometimes turn into concubines before one\u2019s very eyes.\u201d</p><p>St. Albans laughed. Gordon shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re unnatural, Villiers. You really are. You don\u2019t give a damn, do you?\u201d</p><p>Gordon moved forward a rook, so Villiers took it. \u201cCheck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Gordon bleated.</p><p>\u201cMy queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a bishop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but I\u2019m afraid the concubine will take care of the bishop, as they so often do,\u201d Villiers pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOne might say that concubines conquer all,\u201d St. Albans said, with his high cackle.</p><p>Villiers pushed back from the table. He couldn\u2019t take another moment of this god-awful idiocy. \u201cGentlemen, at your service,\u201d he said, bowing.</p><p>Gordon looked up from where he was glowering at the board. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that,\u201d he said, his pale blue eyes wide. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any rutting involved. In the library, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there so clearly was this afternoon,\u201d Villiers said gently. \u201cA concubine, you see, will always display her nature, and I am happy to pass my ownership to Gryffyn. Your new piece,\u201d he said, turning to Jourdain, \u201cis dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Jourdain shook his head. \u201cYou needed the extra bishops to keep her in check.\u201d</p><p>Viscount St. Albans\u2019s laugh said it all.</p><p>No number of bishops could keep a concubine in check.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>April 20</p><p>Day nine of the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>From Damon Reeve, Earl of Gryffyn, to the Duke of Villiers:</p><p>Your description of my future wife is all over London. Your seconds?</p><p>From the Duke of Villiers to the Earl of Gryffyn:</p><p>You\u2019re a fool. If you kill me, she will smell no less perfumed to you, and if I kill you, you will soon smell much worse.</p><p>From the Earl of Gryffyn to the Duke of Villiers:</p><p>Your choice of weapons?</p><p>From the Duke of Villiers to the Earl of Gryffyn:</p><p>Rapiers. Dawn, Wimbledon Commons, near the windmill. Tuesday. I have a chess game planned with Lord Bonnington tomorrow and can\u2019t bother with this.

I shall, however, resign myself to killing you.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>April 21</p><p>Day ten of the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>I t was a noise beside her bed that woke her up. \u201cMmmm,\u201d Roberta said, reaching out\u2014and waking up instantly. \u201cTeddy! Are you lost again, child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He stood next to the bed like a little ghost in a white nightgown. His face, normally so cheerful, was woebegone.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she said, peering at him. \u201cDid you have a bad dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we sleep with you?\u201d he burst out. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>But it was too late. In clambered a small boy and a kitten, who promptly leaped to the bottom of the bed and curled up there, somewhat to Roberta\u2019s relief.</p><p>It took her twenty minutes to coax out of him the information that Rummer had given him. \u201cOf course, Papa will win the duel,\u201d he said, snuggling down into the covers, one hand clasping hers. \u201cPapa always wins, that\u2019s what Rummer says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRummer shouldn\u2019t have told you about the duel,\u201d she said firmly. Her mind was whirling with terror, spinning with the fact of it.</p> <p>If Damon was fighting Villiers, he was fighting for her honor. And her honor, her honor wasn\u2019t worth a scrap of paper, not in comparison to the way she felt about Damon. It was as if mortal coldness gripped her heart and clenched her stomach. What could she do? What could she do?</p><p>She would pull Villiers aside when he came to play his game with Jemma, and she would beg him. Surely he wouldn\u2019t deny her, if only out of whatever fugitive affection that caused him to ask her to marry.</p><p>She stared into the darkness for hours, planning what to say, parsing her sentences, praying.</p><p>Mostly praying.</p><p>She fell asleep only when the light was peeking through the curtains of her bedchamber. Deep in a sleep of leaden exhaustion, she never heard Teddy scamper out of bed and return to the nursery to be roundly scolded by his nursemaid. She never heard her maid tiptoe in and then decide not to wake her, based on the white stillness of her face. She was far too fast asleep to hear the faint commotion that greeted the arrival of the Duke of Villiers, here to play his piece at chess.</p> <p>She slept on.</p><p>When she finally awoke, she was aghast to see how high the sun had risen. But did it really matter? The world knew where Villiers spent his days: at Parsloe\u2019s, playing chess. He had told her so himself. She\u2019d find him there, if she had to.</p><p>She dressed in an utterly charming affair of light silk embroidered with bluebirds. Quite in Villiers\u2019s line, now she thought of it.</p><p>She went straight to Jemma\u2019s chamber, bursting into the room, hoping that Villiers was there, only to see the blood drain from Jemma\u2019s face when she told her Teddy\u2019s news.</p><p>\u201cVilliers said nothing to me this morning,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cVilliers has already been here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe left an hour ago.\u201d Jemma swallowed. \u201cOh God Almighty, why couldn\u2019t you have kept out of Damon\u2019s bed while you were engaged to Villiers?\u201d</p><p>Roberta sank into a chair. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know! I shall die from the guilt of it. I love Damon so much that I lost my head. I didn\u2019t think.\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s face softened. \u201cI gather you no longer love Villiers, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a common condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask Villiers to back down,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cDo you think it might work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lost this morning,\u201d Jemma said hollowly.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe lost the game. All of London will know by this afternoon. He lost to a woman. To me.\u201d</p><p>There was no one in the breakfast room. Fowle informed her that Mrs. Grope had gone to the theater again, and her father had gone out. The mermaid, Roberta thought.</p><p>Damon had taken Teddy away for the day. A last day with his son, Roberta thought, and her heart flooded with such guilt that she could scarcely breathe. She would stop this duel if she had to kill Villiers herself.</p><p>Unfortunately, like chess, she had neglected to study the fine points of swordsmanship.</p><p>\u201cI should like a carriage,\u201d she told Fowle, and a few minutes later, a smart chaise awaited her.</p><p>Roberta pulled on her gloves. She was icy calm now. She was going to stop this monstrous thing before it happened.</p><p>Parsloe\u2019s was a rather ordinary looking place for all the attention it got, to Roberta\u2019s mind. She was met by a butler who asked her if she was a member of the chess club.</p><p>\u201cI am not,\u201d Roberta said, rather startled. \u201cI didn\u2019t known there were female members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are,\u201d he said with a regal bow. \u201cMay I help you, Madame?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should like to see the Duke of Villiers,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that he is upstairs, in the Members\u2019 Rooms, and no one who is not a member is allowed therein.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have to make an exception,\u201d Roberta said.</p><p>There must have been something in her eye because he stopped being a starched butler and cowered a little. \u201cOf course, you are a lady,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am not any lady,\u201d she told him. \u201cI am engaged to the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case!\u201d he said, gesturing to the stairs. \u201cAfter you, my lady, after you.\u201d</p><p>She climbed up the stairs and a moment later found herself in a room filled with gentlemen. They were all watching Villiers, which made it easy to find him, at any rate. He was spectacularly dressed, sitting at one end of the table, his legs spread wide. He looked absorbed, elegant\u2014and dangerous.</p><p>Roberta dizzily took in the muscled strength of his shoulders and the controlled menace in the way he put down each chess piece. He looked like a man who would slay an opponent with no more emotion than he would take a pawn.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, coming to stand before the table. The other man looked up quickly and suddenly the whole room was on their feet, bowing and scraping. She ignored them, looking directly at Villiers. \u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, dropping a curtsy. \u201cI came to beg some private conversation.\u201d</p><p>His eyes rested on her, cold, indifferent. How had she ever thought that was an attractive trait in a man? He was loathsome to her now, snakelike in his magnificence.</p><p>\u201cI see no reason for that,\u201d he said. \u201cI am in the middle of a match, as you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Your Grace,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>But he looked at her with something akin to hatred. \u201cIf you must speak, speak here. There is nothing, it seems, in my life that is secret\u2014is there, St. Albans?\u201d</p><p>The slender young man standing to the side shrugged. \u201cIt is the fate of all of us to occasionally find our faces depicted in the windows of Humphrey\u2019s.\u201d His eyes lingered on Roberta, and she realized that he knew precisely who she was, and he was thinking about the cartoons in Rambler\u2019s Magazine that were sold in Humphrey\u2019s Print Shop. Slowly she looked about and while she didn\u2019t see hostility, she did see knowledge. They knew who she was. They knew that she had been cartooned as desperate for a husband, as begging a footman to marry her. They knew that she had spurned Villiers for the Earl of Gryffyn.</p><p>She looked back at Villiers. He stood beside his chair, his eyes impenetrable.</p><p>She walked a step forward, and then she fell to her knees.</p><p>There was a gasp in the room, and a rustle of agitation. Roberta ignored it. \u201cPlease, Your Grace. Please do not fight a duel with the Earl of Gryffyn. He is my future husband, and I cannot bear to see him die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would not have expected this of you,\u201d he said, staring down at her and actually looking rather startled. \u201cI thought you were of different stock than your father, Lady Roberta.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in error. I find myself more like him every day. Please. I am begging you. I am desperate.\u201d</p><p>There was a murmur around the room, a flourishing of whispers. \u201cRaise her up,\u201d someone said to Villiers. And: \u201cThis isn\u2019t decent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Villiers started, and came forward. He reached out a hand but she shook her head. \u201cNot until you promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot promise,\u201d he told her, and she could have sworn that she saw a flash of sympathy in those cold eyes of his. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a matter of your honor, but that of Gryffyn\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy honor is worthless!\u201d she cried.</p><p>He stooped down and brought her to her feet. \u201cYour courage is not worthless, Lady Roberta.\u201d He kept her hands for a moment. \u201cI will apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the best I can do, and since I\u2019ve never done such a thing before in my life, you see that my apology means that I put your honor at a rather higher pitch than your own valuation.\u201d</p> <p>He dropped her hands and turned away. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, milady, we have a chess match to finish.\u201d</p><p>An arm came around her shoulder, and Roberta felt herself pulled away.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cunningham!\u201d she said dully. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI often play a match during the afternoon when His Grace is in the House of Lords.\u201d He said nothing further, and Roberta couldn\u2019t bring herself to say anything either. So he accompanied her home in silence.</p><p>It had to be enough.</p> <p>It simply...had to be enough.</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>April 22</p><p>Day eleven: the Beaumont/Beaumont chess match</p><p>remains in play</p><p>D awn was curling over Wimbledon Commons, making the wheels of all the carriages disappear and look as if their fat bellies were scraping the ground.</p> <p>\u201cI shall be sick,\u201d Roberta said between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cOpen the carriage door,\u201d Jemma said, not helpfully. She was crying, just a little. She hadn\u2019t said anything, but Roberta saw her wipe away a tear, and then another. \u201cDamon will be fine,\u201d she said, as if to herself.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know how to fight with a sword?\u201d Roberta whispered.</p><p>Jemma frowned at her. \u201cOf course he does!\u201d</p><p>Carriages and more carriages kept pulling up until there was a double row, and men pushed by their door as if they were going to see a cock fight.</p><p>\u201cVilliers said he would apologize,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cHe promised.\u201d Her fists were clenched. \u201cShould I go and remind him, Jemma?\u201d she cried. \u201cShould I go and see what\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>But Jemma shook her head, her eyes bleak. \u201cYou\u2019ve done all you can. If you shame Villiers in front of all these people, there\u2019s no saying what he might do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would shame him?\u201d Roberta asked desperately.</p> <p>\u201cTo have you intervene again. And you would shame Damon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he would live!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will live,\u201d Jemma said. But her face was icy white.</p><p>\u201cI begged him not to go,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cHe just laughed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Damon.\u201d</p><p>They waited, and still fog curled in the center of the field, and nothing happened. \u201cWhat is a rapier?\u201d Roberta said, forcing the words past stiff lips. \u201cDo you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thin blade,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cIt is favored by the French and considered to be agile, intelligent and supple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Roberta said, unable to get her mind around this cluster of adjectives. \u201cDo you think that Damon can fight with it?\u201d</p><p>Jemma turned her head and stared at her. \u201cWhat makes you question Damon\u2019s ability so?\u201d</p><p>Just then two men walked onto the field and Roberta gasped. They weren\u2019t Villiers and Damon, but the seconds. They seemed to be scuffing the grass, seeing if it was slippery with dew.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said, \u201cVilliers himself told me that chess players are the finest duelists. That makes him the finest sword fighter in the kingdom. It\u2019s not Damon\u2019s skill I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s Villiers\u2019s that terrifies me.\u201d</p><p>Jemma laughed, and the sound of it jarred Roberta to the bottom of her stomach. \u201cWhat makes you think that Damon can\u2019t play chess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never\u2014He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite likely the best chess player in England,\u201d Jemma said flatly. \u201cMy father taught us both and it was his considered opinion that Damon had an edge on me. Damon finds the game boring because it doesn\u2019t present enough of a challenge.\u201d</p><p>Roberta swallowed. \u201cNot enough of a challenge? Then, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked of nothing, all this time you spent in bed together?\u201d</p><p>Roberta shook her head. \u201cNot about the right things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBills of Exchange. He plays with them, manipulates the market. He moves on a larger chess board; he\u2019s like my husband in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe really can fence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Jemma said irritably. \u201cHe\u2019s fought at least four duels that I know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he win all four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me last night that he had decided to strike Villiers in the right shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you see the thought pattern of a master player,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cPhilidor often called the piece with which he would check my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut were any of Damon\u2019s previous opponents chess masters?\u201d</p><p>There was a sigh. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>To the side of the field, Damon was talking to his second. \u201cThere\u2019s not so much fog that we can\u2019t see,\u201d he said impatiently. He wanted to get this over with and go back to breakfast with Roberta. He knew she was there, poor mouse, huddled in the carriage with Jemma.</p><p>The second hurried over to talk to Villiers\u2019s second, and then rushed back.</p><p>\u201cHis Grace would like to speak to you a moment,\u201d he said.</p><p>Damon dropped his coat onto the wet grass. He would fight in his old boots and a shirt, rolled up to the sleeves. He took one more look at his rapier, a beautiful length of steel from Toledo. He almost had an unfair advantage, using it. Still, he picked it up and strolled over to Villiers\u2019s gaudy carriage.</p><p>The duke was stripped to a shirt. He was bending his blade, testing its spring.</p><p>\u201cToledo,\u201d Damon said with pleasure. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Villiers lifted those heavy eyes of his and murmured, \u201cAn even match is always best.\u201d</p><p>Damon waited a moment but Villiers seemed to be having some trouble speaking. Finally, he said in an almost strangled voice, \u201cI want to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize. I should not have maligned Lady Roberta\u2019s honor.\u201d</p><p>Damon narrowed his eyes. \u201cShe got to you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked up again. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoberta. What did she do, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fell on her knees in Parsloe\u2019s,\u201d Villiers said flatly. \u201cShe begged me not to fight you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds very dramatic.\u201d Damon loved the sound of it.</p><p>\u201cOh, believe me,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cIt was. She enjoyed a wide audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Now that\u2019s out of the way, shall we start?\u201d</p><p>Villiers glanced at him. \u201cMy apology?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have acquiesced to any demand of hers as well,\u201d Damon said. \u201cBut the fact of it is, Villiers, we\u2019re going to fight. Now.\u201d</p><p>Villiers, looking up at the earl, saw him as a man with an easy smile, a man whom he had obviously never understood. A sudden thought struck him. \u201cDo you play chess?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNever,\u201d Damon said promptly. \u201cBores me to tears. The only partner I ever had who could give me a challenge was my sister. How\u2019s the game with her going, by the way?\u201d</p><p>Villiers stared at him. Gryffyn was as unmoved by the prospect of a duel as he was by the prospect of death. For the first time, he felt a faint prickling. A faint warning in the back of his mind. \u201cI lost,\u201d he said. \u201cI lost the game yesterday.\u201d</p><p>But the earl was already striding out onto the field, hailing their seconds.</p><p>Villiers walked out more slowly, rearranging his expectations of the game. He was going to have to kill\u2014or be killed. In the earl\u2019s eyes was the deadly cheer of a man whose future wife has been maligned and who will die to protect her honor. Except that Gryffyn clearly had no intention of dying.</p> <p>Two minutes later they were circling each other, their boots leaving prints on the wet grass.</p><p>\u201cWe can wait until the sun dries the grass if you\u2019d like,\u201d Gryffyn offered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Villiers couldn\u2019t help but remember himself, offering Gordon a rook advantage.</p><p>He started watching for an opening. The earl seemed content to circle forever. Finally Villiers swooped in with an upward-cutting manchette blow. Parried by Gryffyn. He tried a pass in tierce and a redoublement. Parried, and parried again. Finally Villiers fell back, deciding to let the earl make the next move.</p><p>When he did, it was supremely smooth, a twisting, swirling demi-volte that seemed to come out of nowhere. It was only luck that Villiers\u2019s blade caught his opponent\u2019s rapier, deflecting the blow.</p> <p>Gryffyn fell back and they circled once more. But there was something different about him now; the brooding joy of a predator was in every movement of those long legs.</p><p>There was nothing so terrible about that, except that Villiers himself didn\u2019t have the energy of virtue behind him. He felt wrong.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have called Roberta a concubine, not after he told her to go lose her chastity. He was the one who whipped her into Gryffyn\u2019s bed, and then castigated her for it. And then too...there was Benjamin in the back of his mind.</p><p>Even as he parried a brilliant time-thrust from the earl, he thought about how nothing had gone right since Benjamin died. It was his infernal arrogance, that was it.</p><p>The earl tried a prise de fer; he knocked it to the side. Villiers felt rage rising, finally, from the bottom of his soul. What was he doing on a field in the cold dawn, fighting a duel with a man he was uninterested in killing?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you,\u201d he said, panting, circling, watching the earl\u2019s hands.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you, either,\u201d the earl said. He didn\u2019t appear to be even breathing quickly, which was galling. \u201cI might have, but you apologized.\u201d</p><p>They circled again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have Roberta think that her apology was for naught,\u201d the earl said. \u201cThe right shoulder should do it.\u201d</p><p>Villiers narrowed his eyes, but he didn\u2019t even see the envelopment coming. It came from above, and sang through the air with a melody like death, twisted, flicked at the last second, slid home with a terrible scrape by the bone.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s rapier dropped to the ground.</p><p>Gryffyn withdrew his blade; it was glossy with blood. Villiers bent over, breathing heavily.</p><p>Gryffyn shouted, \u201cWe could use the surgeon here!\u201d</p><p>Villiers heard feet, and realizing for the first time how close the circle of spectators had come, straightened. Blood was running down his right arm and oddly, it felt cold rather than warm. \u201cI regret any impunity to your lady\u2019s honor,\u201d he said, resorting to the antiquated language used by their grandparents.</p> <p>\u201cI am at your service,\u201d Gryffyn replied.</p><p>The surgeon was upon them, offering Villiers a bottle of brandy and ripping off his shirt. Gryffyn was off, running\u2014he was actually running\u2014toward the Duke of Beaumont\u2019s carriage.</p><p>Villiers upended the bottle for a moment with his left arm, and watched him go with disbelief. God forbid that he should ever become so tied to a woman. Or she to him. He shuddered at the thought.</p><p>The idea of a woman kneeling to ask for his life...</p><p>It was beyond distasteful.</p><p>Disgusting, really.</p><p>He upended the bottle again.</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>T hey returned for breakfast to find the house full of gentlemen shouting congratulations to Damon, ladies sighing over the injury to the Duke of Villiers, servants running hither and fro with glasses and plates.</p><p>No one would know from the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s smiling face that she had been white with terror but an hour earlier. No one would know from her husband\u2019s imperturbable calm that he too had found himself pacing the floor, unable to concentrate on the business of the realm.</p><p>She was standing with Viscount St. Albans, discussing the likelihood that Villiers would develop an infection. \u201cA good half of the cases,\u201d St. Albans reported. \u201cBut he had the best surgeon available and the man drenched the wound in brandy. I saw to that myself. No use shirking on brandy when a man\u2019s life is at stake.\u201d</p><p>Her husband touched her on the shoulder. \u201cI thought we might play our piece,\u201d Beaumont said.</p><p>To Elijah\u2019s eyes his wife didn\u2019t look quite right. Her lips were rather pale. She took his arm, which she never did.</p><p>He watched her as they settled before the board. \u201cLet\u2019s just sit for a moment,\u201d he suggested. \u201cDoes Villiers have a deep wound, then?\u201d</p><p>She visibly shuddered. \u201cI can\u2019t abide talk of these things. I believe not. Damon is enormously skilled and apparently he knew precisely where he wanted to place the blade. Villiers should experience no lasting effect.\u201d</p><p>Elijah watched her stare at the board and knew that for the first time he was seeing his wife when she could not concentrate on chess. He moved and said, \u201cCheck.\u201d She reached out her hand. \u201cWait,\u201d he said. She was going to move her king\u2019s rook, which would give him checkmate.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cLet\u2019s just rest for a moment. I am frightfully tired,\u201d he said.</p><p>She frowned a little, and her hand fell back to her lap. \u201cI do think you ought to work less, Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call me Elijah sometimes,\u201d he said, hardly able to believe his own ears.</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up, so apparently she was just as surprised. \u201cElijah,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow will you play your game with Villiers now?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI suppose you know that I won the first game in our match yesterday.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cIf I know Villiers he will be chaffing horribly at confinement to the bed. St. Albans told me that the surgeon ordered him to spend a fortnight in his chambers.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s heart sank. Though why it mattered, he couldn\u2019t say.</p><p>Obviously Villiers may have lost his match but he had won something else.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll have to go to him,\u201d he said, his voice as cool and controlled as ever.</p><p>She shot him a quick glance and fell to frowning over the board again. Her hand came out and she moved the rook.</p><p>\u201cCheckmate,\u201d he said, in response.</p><p>Jemma stared at the board as if she\u2019d never lost before.</p><p>Beaumont had the odd feeling that they were experiencing the same thing at the same time.</p><p>It was a good thing that Roberta no longer feared making a spectacle of herself, because she could not stop clinging to Damon. Her father grabbed her arm at one point. \u201cMrs. Grope has decided to return to the theater!\u201d he said, not looking half as miserable as one might expect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe theater?\u201d Roberta said, startled into paying attention. \u201cAs an actress? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a hair dresser. Apparently the manager of Drury Lane was so impressed by her London Bridge effect that he\u2019s invited her to dress wigs for all the performances of the coming season. I shall handsomely endow her, of course. But it means, my dear, that Mrs. Grope will no longer be part of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Damon looked as if he might be about to walk into another room, and Roberta didn\u2019t want to let him out of her sight. He paused to talk to Lord Corbin, so she turned back to her father.</p><p>\u201cBut Papa, what of the mermaid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat of her?\u201d he said, looking a bit sly and a bit happy.</p><p>\u201cWill she return home with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d he roared. \u201cShe\u2019s a decent young woman, daughter of a vicar in Somerset, not to mention a gifted poet.\u201d He started rocking back and forth on his heels. \u201cDo you know, Roberta, that she began as the versifying mermaid at only ten years of age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is she now?\u201d Roberta asked, half listening.</p><p>\u201cI believe she is around thirty, and...\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t let Damon out of her sight, not when her heart was still pounding with fright. So she dropped a kiss on her papa\u2019s cheek and slipped away. Finally Damon swept her off to the yellow sitting room and offered to play her at dollymop dominoes if she would let him go to the privy.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>But by the time he came back, she was crying again, and she couldn\u2019t stop, even when he kissed away her tears, and laughed at her, and finally tickled her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I might have lost you,\u201d she said, hiccupping.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said, cupping her face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou might have died!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you never when it comes to death. But when I die, Roberta, I swear it to God that unless it\u2019s an accident I shall do it in my own bed, with you by my side. In other words, I wouldn\u2019t put myself in harm\u2019s way, not when I have you and Teddy and\u201d\u2014He smiled at her and there was something so tender in his eyes that she hiccupped again\u2014\u201cwe might have a babe in a few months too, Roberta. Have you thought of that?\u201d</p><p>She dismissed that thought as fit for another day. \u201cHow could you possibly know you would beat Villiers? It was all so sudden, and violent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you never seen a sword fight before?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m certain he almost stabbed you straight to the heart several times.\u201d</p><p>Damon actually laughed. \u201cSword fighting is tiresomely predictable, Roberta, and Villiers had no chance of injuring me. Truly. If he had really wished to kill me, he would have chosen pistols, because that changes the whole nature of the meeting. I knew that Villiers was an excellent swordsman. I also knew that I was better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you know that you were better?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou haven\u2019t met him before; Roberta told me so!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh ye of little faith,\u201d he said, gathering her close. \u201cI practice several times a week with Galliano, that\u2019s why. He\u2019s the best fencing master in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have faith in you,\u201d she said, her voice muffled against his chest. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He held her away, just enough so that she could see his eyes. \u201cI knew I would win because I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014You wouldn\u2019t lose to Villiers because\u2014because\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was grinning at her like the fool he was. \u201cBecause I love you too much to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014You!\u201d she cried and flew at him, but whether it was to hit him for his male foolishness or what, she never knew because he kissed her so hard that the idea flew straight out of her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked, sometime later, when she was clinging to his shoulders.</p><p>A crooked smile played on the corner of her mouth. \u201cWill I win a duel fought for your honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking whether I love you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything. It was, Roberta realized, the very first time that she\u2019d seen a shadow of anxiety in that huge, confident man, so easy with his smiles, so unassuming about his skills. So she relished it.</p><p>For a short time.</p><p>\u201cOf course I love you,\u201d she whispered, cupping his face in her hands. \u201cAnd I always will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I take to poetry and start writing poems to your toe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I fall on my knees in the street and beg you to take me back to bed?\u201d</p><p>She was starting to smile, but: \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am on my knees, Roberta. I am begging.\u201d</p><p>A passing footman heard laughter from the sitting room and shook his head.</p><p>Beaumont House had certainly changed since the duchess came back from Paris. Used to be the place was respectable. But now...wait till Fowle heard what that French piece named Mademoiselle Caro was thinking of doing for the duchess\u2019s next ball. Every one of them nekked ladies would have peacock feathers at their behinds, that\u2019s what he heard.</p><p>With a sigh he pulled the sitting room door shut so that no one would accidentally see something they shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>When the Villiers/Beaumont chess matches</p><p>were fading in memory</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d Roberta said, \u201cyou might have let me win that one.\u201d</p><p>Who do you think you are, His Majesty himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was very nice of you to allow the prince to win last night,\u201d she conceded.</p><p>Her husband pushed away the chess set that lay between them on the bed. \u201cYou know how to play now. Perhaps we can try something else. I\u2019m very fond of dominoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find it tedious partnering me?\u201d She dimpled at him.</p><p>\u201cNothing with you is tedious, except perhaps chess.\u201d He dropped a kiss on her ear. \u201cThere are so many more interesting things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d she murmured, falling back onto the cushions.</p><p>He took her invitation in a second, rolling on top of her and propping himself up on his elbows. \u201cSuch as kissing you,\u201d he said, suiting action to words.</p><p>\u201cBut what,\u201d she said, \u201cif I told you a surprise? Would that interest you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan there be any surprises, after hearing that your father married a mermaid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter a proper courtship,\u201d she reminded him.</p><p>\u201cYes, but once you\u2019ve brought a fish into the family, there\u2019s no saying what will come next. Is it about Teddy? Because I think he\u2019s turning into a fish as well. His nursemaid told me that he was in the river for hours yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a baby?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He froze for a second and then practically levitated off her body. \u201cDid I injure you?\u201d he gasped.</p><p>She sat up, laughing. \u201cDamon?\u201d</p><p>He came back to the bed and sat beside her, spreading his huge hands on her belly, his face a mixture of tenderness and love. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour belly is as flat as ever.\u201d</p><p>She started giggling. \u201cBabies take a long time, Damon. Talk to me about flat bellies in a few months!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He bent down and kissed her tummy without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cDamon?\u201d And then, when he still didn\u2019t say anything, \u201cDarling?\u201d</p><p>Finally he lifted his head. His eyes were filled with tears. \u201cBut\u2014you never cry,\u201d she said, foolishly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy. You make me so happy.\u201d</p> <p>She wound her arms around him and pulled him back on top of her. \u201cHappiness makes you teary?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at that. \u201cI\u2019ve always won things fairly easy, Roberta.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cChess matches, fencing matches\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUntil you came along, and told me you were in love with Villiers, and you wanted to marry him. And that you didn\u2019t want to marry me. And then he asked you to marry him, and for the first time in my life it felt as if something important was slipping away from me and I might lose.</p><p>\u201cEven then I didn\u2019t understand that you are the only important thing.\u201d The tears stood unashamedly in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh silly one,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou have me, remember? I love you. I\u2019m your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not playing chess anymore because there are no games that matter next to you, Roberta.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him into silence.</p><p>A while later the Earl and Countess of Gryffyn lay curled together like two spoons, sleeping the kind of slumber that only happens in the afternoon, after the sweetest of marital intimacies.</p> <p>But in the countess\u2019s tummy a little baby was awake. She turned a few acrobatic circles and practiced swimming, an activity enjoyed by babies, mermaids and big brothers. Then she flung out her arms in a huge dramatic gesture. And finally, her tiny mouth quirked into something that would resemble a smile, except babies that small can\u2019t smile. She resembled her papa most of all...which meant that joy would walk beside her all the days of her life.</p><p>Especially when she fell in love. </p> </body></html>"]
