The fan overhead turned, but sweat still ran down her forehead. She would have wiped it away, but the fuckers had tied her hands to the bedpost the night before. Poor little kidnappers couldn\u2019t handle one small escape attempt without getting pissy. Too bad she\u2019d only managed to cut one of them before they had captured her again.</p><p>Alea closed her eyes. Sunset had shadowed the little room with increasing darkness. They would be back, and she wasn\u2019t sure she could handle another night of watching her abductors use the other women they had caged with her.</p><p>They were all in school, the pigs had told her. They were supposed to learn what a woman\u2019s real place was.</p> <p>Before she\u2019d been taken and sent to this hell, she\u2019d been a graduate student at New York University, studying international politics. Now she was majoring in misery, forced to watch her fellow abductees endure all kinds of sexual deviancy from men who abused them.</p><p>From the room beside her, she could hear the high-pitched whimper of a woman in pain and the staccato thud of a headboard hitting the wall.</p><p>Alea shut her eyes, wishing she could close her ears to block out the sound. When would this nightmare end? The days were bleeding together. She was losing track of time\u2014and her grip on the carefree woman she\u2019d once been.</p><p>When she\u2019d first been abducted, she\u2019d kept a careful count, marking out each day in small scratches on the wall. They were still there, all sixty-some odd lines\u2014proof that she\u2019d once hoped someone would find her. The endless cycle of time and pain had marched on, and she\u2019d stopped carving those stupid lines. With no way to fight the drugs they fed her, time had become meaningless. She merely alternated between being dazed and terrified. When she was lucid, the world around her seemed foreign. Rapid-fire Spanish she couldn\u2019t quite wrap her brain around and unfamiliar men, not to mention a situation so alien and horrific, she still struggled to comprehend. Coping was out of the question. Did it matter if she was here a day or a lifetime? Hell was hell.</p><p>And she was quickly rotting in it.</p> <p>Lately, her captors had taken to doping her up more. Some days, Alea wasn\u2019t sure what was real and what was a hallucination. The worst part was being dependent on that needle. Even now she was sweating, her stomach cramping, because she\u2019d been too long without a fix, but there was no way they would wean her off of it again after her last escape attempt.</p><p>Suddenly, the doorknob was turning. Alea frowned, bracing herself. Perhaps this would be the end. Maybe this would be the moment they bound and trussed her up, then shipped her off to some asshole who would rape her and torture her for the rest of her short life. And it would be short, because she had no intention of being some man\u2019s plaything. She was Alea Binte al Mussad, descendant of the royal family of Bezakistan. She was a princess. She had pride. And she would go down fighting and try her damnedest to take as many of these bastards with her as she could.</p><p>A single moment flashed across her mind. A sweet summer\u2019s day at the palace when she\u2019d been a child turning her face up to the sun. The inner garden had been her own private world. Her beloved cousins had been older, but they\u2019d still played hide and seek with her, calling for their little \u201cmonkey,\u201d a nickname she\u2019d earned because she climbed the trees and made her nannies insane with worry.</p><p>But they don\u2019t know you, little monkey, Talib would say. They don\u2019t know how strong you are. One small tree can\u2019t take you down. Some days, I\u2019m not even certain a small army can.</p><p>The door opened with a small squeaking sound that signaled her torture would now continue. There were no trees to climb in this place, no armies to fight, only suffering.</p><p>She turned her gaze to see which pig had come to hurt her. An unfamiliar man in all black slid inside the door with a gun wrapped around his chest. He held it the way she\u2019d seen military men grip their weapons, like a mere extension of their arms.</p> <p>Was this a new torturer? If so, then her end would likely be very soon because this man was a killer.</p><p>\u201cAlea?\u201d The words were whispered, but came through loud and clear as if the man who spoke them expected to be understood and obeyed.</p><p>No one had called her by her name in...forever. Here, she was \u201cgirl\u201d or \u201cputa.\u201d For the briefest moment, she considered denying her name and perhaps avoiding her terrible fate, but her name was all she had left. If she died, she would die as Alea.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to stay as quiet as possible. My name is Cole Lennox. Your cousin sent me.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for the words to sink in. Cole Lennox? She\u2019d never heard of the man before. Her cousin? Talib? Or Yasmin? Would Yas even know how to hire a mercenary? It didn\u2019t matter. Someone had come for her. Or had her \u201ckeepers\u201d found a new, fun way to torment her and extort money from her royal relatives? Would this man get her hopes up, only to show her a new terror?</p><p>Cole Lennox towered over her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to fight me, aren\u2019t you? You think you don\u2019t know me, but you do. I saw you once at the palace right after I brought Tal back from his ordeal. You invited me into the drawing room and offered me tea. I need you to understand that if I have to, I will knock you out in order to save you.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled, the first she\u2019d felt in months, and she fought them ferociously. Now that he was closer, she remembered. Lieutenant Lennox had saved her cousin from radicals, and now it appeared he was going to save her.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t allow me clothes. I\u2019m not wearing anything under this sheet.\u201d Shame crashed over her like a wave on the beach.</p><p>He shrugged out of the black shirt he wore, revealing a T-shirt. He set the shirt aside and produced a knife. Her hands and feet were free in seconds, and he was wrapping the shirt around her, carefully avoiding looking for more than a cursory glance below her neck.</p><p>Alea stood, her hands shaking as Cole Lennox began to lead her out, step by creeping step. In the distance, she heard gunfire and shouting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s baby brother doing his job.\u201d He winked over his shoulder at her. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>She followed Cole out, but the girl he\u2019d met all those years ago was long gone. They could take her back to the palace, but a part of her would always be trapped here, forever tainted.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Bezakistan \u2013 Two years later</p><p>Alea escaped from the glittering lights and laughter of the ballroom. Everything about the evening was lovely and elegant, and she couldn\u2019t breathe. It wasn\u2019t her dress or the amount of food she\u2019d consumed, but the press of bodies, the expectation, the terror she could never quite shake...</p><p>The warm night air caressed her skin as she closed the balcony doors behind her. The terrace overlooked the garden at the center of the palace. Normally, the doors would be open and a bar would have been placed out here, but Dane Mitchell, one of Tal\u2019s bodyguards, had decreed it unsafe for the time being. After an episode that had nearly ended in the murder of her cousins\u2019 wife a few months ago, Dane had been on a security tear. Everyone had tried to explain to him that the perpetrator, Khalil, was dead and wasn\u2019t likely to rise as a zombie to eat Piper\u2019s brains. Alea felt a smile cross her face. She\u2019d been the one to use that argument. But Talib, Rafiq, and Kadir, ever vigilant, had signed on to the new \u201ckeep the women safe\u201d plan.</p><p>To Alea, it felt more like the \u201cnever let the women have any fun\u201d plan. Or a minute alone.</p><p>\u201cHello, Landon.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to turn around to know he stood there, strong and stalwart. She\u2019d heard the briefest squeak of the door opening...then nothing. Landon Nix never made a sound, but sometimes little things like squeaky hinges defeated his silent grace.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to talk. I just can\u2019t leave you alone. Pretend I\u2019m not here.\u201d</p><p>Impossible. She turned and stared at the quietest of her three watchmen, all of whom had been hired months after her rescue. By then, she\u2019d recovered, and Alea was beyond glad they had never seen her so weak. They had been apprised of her abduction and given sketchy details, but by the time Tal had hired them, thanks to Cole Lennox\u2019s advice, at least her body had recovered. The three guards kept her safe day and night. And had quickly become the bane of her existence.</p><p>As well as the center of her every fantasy.</p><p>Landon hovered in the corner, shadows clinging to him, making him look even more dangerous than normal. He was six foot three and leaner than the two Mack Trucks he called friends, but there was no way he was any less lethal. Her brain told her that, but something about him put her at ease in a way she wasn\u2019t with the other two. Dane was so dark and dominant. Coop was a relentless flirt\u2014both things that scared the crap out of her. But Landon, with his golden hair and face, with his expression so often as placid as an untouched lake, was a calming presence. He never pushed her too hard to talk or demanded her smiles. When he guarded her, he simply followed and made sure she got where she needed to go. Coop and Dane either pretended to flirt with her or downright insisted that she follow their direction, but Landon just quietly did his job.</p><p>He was a little like the large, gorgeous Labrador retriever she\u2019d had as a child. Except she had never dreamed about sharing Duke\u2019s wet kisses, much less taking on his friends.</p><p>She had to stop thinking that way, but Landon made that difficult when he stood so near and the night fell softly all around her. She\u2019d snuck away to escape the crowd, but she was surprised at just how much she liked being out here alone with Lan. \u201cDid Tal make you wear that tux?\u201d</p><p>Even in the deep gloom, she saw his telling flush. Maybe Lan\u2019s down-to-earth nature was what made her feel so comfortable. He was obviously uneasy with the wealth around him. Ever since she\u2019d returned to Bezakistan and the palace, she had felt the same way. She\u2019d seen real suffering in the real world, and sometimes this opulence chafed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I have to wear this monkey suit. It was made for me, but it still feels too tight,\u201d Lan said with a bit of a Texas drawl.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help herself. He was far too endearing to ignore. Months and months of trying had just proven she wasn\u2019t capable.</p><p>Alea closed the space between them. \u201cThe suit fits you perfectly, but the tie is too tight.\u201d</p><p>He looked up, his eyes flaring briefly as she neared. \u201cI\u2019m not much good with clothes like this. I have to admit, I liked the uniforms in the Army better. Uncle Sam\u2019s dress code made it easy.\u201d</p><p>And she\u2019d bet he\u2019d looked good. Of course, he looked devastatingly handsome in a tux, too.</p><p>Dangerous train of thought. Stop now. After hesitating for an instant, she forced herself to buck up and do what she\u2019d crossed the room to accomplish.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d she asked before reaching for his tie.</p><p>Lan nodded, and she quickly undid the black scrap of silk. The Armani tuxedo had been perfectly fitted, but she knew very well that his normal wardrobe choices ran more toward sweat pants and loose fitting T-shirts. It was a crime against women everywhere that the man didn\u2019t just walk around shirtless.</p><p>Don\u2019t go there, Alea. He can\u2019t handle your damage. None of them can. And you can\u2019t handle them.</p><p>Her inner voice was way more practical than she was, but it was also right. Landon Nix was a gorgeous god of a man who wouldn\u2019t look at her twice if her cousins weren\u2019t paying him to. None of them would. She\u2019d seen a picture of Dane\u2019s ex-wife once. She\u2019d been blonde and stacked and gorgeous. She wasn\u2019t sure why they\u2019d divorced, but it couldn\u2019t have had anything to do with a lack of desire. Any heterosexual man would want that woman.</p><p>No one would want Alea if she wasn\u2019t tied to the fabulously wealthy, royal al Mussads.</p><p>Landon didn\u2019t move a muscle as she knotted his tie again, this time much looser. No wonder he\u2019d been uncomfortable. He\u2019d practically strangled himself. She smoothed down the lapels of his jacket, feeling his hard chest beneath. He was so close and he smelled incredible. The heat of his skin penetrated her senses. His gorgeously sculpted lips lingered just above her own. His eyes, which had always seemed so cold, were now a warm blue and focused intently on her. A flash of heat passed through her body.</p><p>If he knew what she was thinking, she would undoubtedly make a complete fool of herself because he was her cousins\u2019 employee.</p><p>Quickly, Alea retreated, needing some distance between them. \u201cThere you go. That should be more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, clearing his throat. \u201cYeah. Thanks. It is. You\u2019re really good with that. I mean with men\u2019s clothes.\u201d His eyes closed briefly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. And you were putting them on, not taking them off. God, I\u2019m just going to shut up now.\u201d</p><p>This was another reason she felt more comfortable with Lan. Looks aside, he wasn\u2019t anywhere near perfect. In fact, he could be a charmingly inept conversationalist. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I only know how to tie a bowtie because Kadir was so bad at it. When Rafiq would try to help him, they would get into fistfights. When I was a girl, they broke my Barbie house. To avoid future disasters, I took care of their ties from that point on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Right up until they had married Piper, and she\u2019d taken over the duty. Tal, Rafe, and Kade were now happy men.</p><p>Alea was still alone. And standing too near Landon wasn\u2019t helping. She crossed back to the stone railing and tried to find some peace. This was one of the few places she felt even a vague connection to her life before her abduction. When it was very quiet, she could almost hear her younger self running among the trees, her head thrown back in laughter.</p><p>Why had she ever left this place? Why did she feel like she didn\u2019t belong here anymore?</p><p>Why could she not focus on anything but Landon right now? \u201cIs there any way you could wait inside, even for five minutes?\u201d</p> <p>No matter how quiet he was, she knew he was there. He was staring, possibly even thinking how boring it was to watch the little downtrodden royal brat.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She turned, frowning his way. \u201cI\u2019m not going to climb down the trellis and run away.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon, don\u2019t be ridiculous. It\u2019s impossible in this dress. You can stand in front of the door,\u201d she tried to bargain with him.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t move, simply stood rooted in place, a mass of muscle in a thousand dollar tux. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you honestly think is going to happen? It\u2019s not as if there are assassins hanging out in the palm trees, waiting for that one moment you turn your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know. Assassins could lay in wait anywhere. I haven\u2019t checked the palm trees, but that wouldn\u2019t shock me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re just going to follow me everywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if you have to go to the bathroom?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t even crack a smile. \u201cI hold it or you get real well acquainted with the men\u2019s urinal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going into the men\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s good I didn\u2019t drink a bunch earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to Tal.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a single, firm nod. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d</p><p>Because Landon knew damn well that Tal would agree with him. \u201cI scarcely think someone has come to Her Highness\u2019s coronation ball to try to kill me. If they\u2019ve come to hurt someone, it\u2019s most likely the others in the royal family. Really, Landon, study a little more history.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, his whole body tightening. His eyes turned cold again. A sickening feeling slid through her, and she knew that she\u2019d just hurt him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t very good at history, Princess. You\u2019ll have to forgive me. I\u2019m just a dumb grunt following the orders of my CO. If you have a problem with it, you should take it up with Dane.\u201d</p><p>Alea winced and looked away. What had she done? An apology sat right on the tip of her tongue. Why? This wasn\u2019t her fault....but it wasn\u2019t his either. He was just doing his job. But damn it, she was being followed twenty-four seven. The only place she was allowed to be alone was her bedroom, and even then, the minute she opened the door, one of them waited outside. She felt like a prisoner in so many ways, and it was wearing her out.</p> <p>As he stared a hole right through her, Alea felt her resolve weakening. She yearned for those blue eyes to glow with the warmth they had just minutes ago.</p><p>The door to the balcony opened, and a lean figure slid through. This man didn\u2019t have a problem with his tuxedo. She was fairly certain that Oliver Thurston-Hughes had been born in a tux. The very noble Brit wouldn\u2019t have done anything so common as to have been born naked.</p><p>\u201cAlea? Darling, are you out here?\u201d He nearly bumped into Landon. \u201cBloody hell, who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over here, Oliver,\u201d she said before Landon could reply.</p><p>A broad smile came over the handsome Brit\u2019s face, and he stepped around the guard, utterly ignoring him, then walked toward her. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking all over for you. That receiving line was complete hell. I\u2019ve never seen so many people.\u201d</p><p>Oliver had been at the last British royal wedding, so Alea doubted that, but he was always polite. Oliver would never say a social function wasn\u2019t the greatest event he\u2019d ever attended. \u201cI was happy when it was over. My face hurts from smiling. Where\u2019s Yasmin?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged an elegant shoulder. \u201cLast I saw, she was dancing with the Prime Minister. She\u2019s been looking for you, though. Alea, it\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d He smiled warmly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a virtual stranger ever since...\u201d</p><p>His words trailed off, and she could see the way he paled when he realized what he\u2019d nearly said.</p><p>\u201cSince she was taken hostage and forced to endure something most people wouldn\u2019t survive?\u201d A sarcastic voice with a low Texas accent cut through the awkward silence. Now Landon decided to get chatty? \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019s sorry she didn\u2019t just pause her recovery to call you up the second she got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one asked you,\u201d Oliver shot back. \u201cWhy is he here? You\u2019re not seeing him, I hope?\u201d</p><p>She saw far too much of Lan. And far too little. \u201cHe\u2019s my bodyguard. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t owe him an apology,\u201d Landon ground out.</p><p>\u201cStay out of this.\u201d She couldn\u2019t handle him getting involved in her personal life. She could barely handle him being her constant watchman. She turned back to Oliver. \u201cI am sorry. It\u2019s been hard to get back into the real world.\u201d</p><p>Oliver was everything that Landon wasn\u2019t. He was perfectly charming as he stared at her with a pitying little frown. \u201cOf course it is, darling. I apologize. It\u2019s terribly selfish of me. It\u2019s simply that Yasmin and I have missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t missed her enough to put off their wedding while she\u2019d been kidnapped. She guessed she couldn\u2019t really blame them. She\u2019d been gone for months. They\u2019d assumed she\u2019d been killed, her body buried somewhere in an unmarked grave. Yasmin hadn\u2019t had any idea that she\u2019d been found until months after the fact. Yas still didn\u2019t know about all the rehab she\u2019d had to go through. The last thing Alea wanted the world to know about was her drug addiction.</p><p>She wondered if Landon knew, if one of the reasons he, Dane, and Coop were so zealous in their guardianship was that they had been tasked to ensure she didn\u2019t hit the streets looking for a fix.</p><p>\u201cI think you should come home with us in a few weeks. We\u2019re going to spend the winter at the country estate. I know my brothers would love to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Oliver\u2019s brothers were outrageous flirts. She didn\u2019t need that. But it did point out a problem. Lately, she been thinking that she couldn\u2019t stay in Bezakistan, aimless and lonely, for the rest of her life. She hadn\u2019t really left the palace. Instead, she\u2019d been hiding here, taking classes online. Sure, she could get a degree that way, but what would happen when she graduated?</p><p>The door opened again. Yasmin glided through the door. She looked gorgeous in her designer gown, her pale hair in a perfect upswept do. \u201cOliver? Oh, you\u2019re out here with Alea. I thought you had gone back to your room, dear.\u201d</p><p>Yasmin utterly ignored Landon, moving around him like he was just a piece of furniture. Her perfectly manicured hands reached for Alea\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHello, Yas.\u201d</p><p>Yasmin had been her childhood playmate. Their fathers had both been connected to the Bezakistani royal line maternally. Alea\u2019s parents had drowned when she was very young, so her aunt and uncle, the sheikh and shaykhah, had taken her in, given her the al Mussad name, and raised her at the palace. But Alea had always looked forward to the weeks when Yasmin would visit. It had been the only time she\u2019d had another female playmate.</p><p>Yasmin hugged her briefly. \u201cAlea, it\u2019s so nice to see you. I tried calling for ages, but no one would put me through. I rather thought you were ducking my calls, dear.\u201d</p><p>Alea groaned inwardly. Yasmin seemed to know how to make her feel guilty, even when she didn\u2019t mean to. \u201cSorry. I really haven\u2019t felt up to socializing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalib has allowed you to hide away for far too long. You\u2019re never going to feel better if you don\u2019t get back to normal.\u201d Yasmin frowned, her perfect face forming a mask of disapproval.</p><p>\u201cYas, let it be. We talked about this.\u201d Oliver reached for his wife\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI know, but seeing her has made me more certain than ever that she can\u2019t recover by languishing here. She hasn\u2019t truly smiled once. And what is Tal thinking putting those guards on her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here for my protection.\u201d Despite her own problems with the guys, she felt an urge to defend them.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need a constant shadow reminding you of danger, Lea. Come to England with us. You can enroll at university and take up your schooling again. Or you can work with me at the foundation.\u201d</p><p>Ah, yes. Reaching Across Cultures. One of the surprises she\u2019d been faced with when she\u2019d been rescued was the fact that Yasmin had taken over the European offices of this al Mussad charity, a job that had been earmarked for Alea.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t like she could do the job now, endure all those glittering fundraisers and public speaking engagements. How would that work when she could barely manage to leave the palace?</p><p>\u201cI just mentioned that myself,\u201d Oliver said with a long sigh. \u201cI thought we were going to do this with a little subtlety. I\u2019m sorry about the hard sell, love. I\u2019m afraid Yasmin has done nothing but plot and plan to take you back with us.\u201d</p><p>Yasmin pouted prettily. \u201cI miss my cousin. I was beside myself when we thought you were gone forever. It was like losing my sister.\u201d She sniffled a little, a tear sliding down her face. \u201cLea, I miss you. Please think about coming back with us. I want you to be there when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to tell her that, either,\u201d Oliver muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep it from her. She\u2019s my closest relative. Oh, Lea. You weren\u2019t there when we got married. You have to be there when I have my first baby. Please say you\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>Yasmin was pregnant? Silly, superficial Yasmin was married and now having a child. A little kernel of jealousy weighed in her gut. Yas had been the prankster when they were young. She\u2019d nearly dropped out of school. She hadn\u2019t even thought of going to university. So how was Yas the one with a husband and a career that should have been Alea\u2019s, and a baby on the way?</p><p>She struggled to find something to say. She looked down at Yasmin, who was perfectly slender in her Marchesa gown. \u201cYou don\u2019t look pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Yasmin\u2019s smile lit up the night. She ran a hand down her flat stomach. \u201cI assure you I am. I\u2019m almost three months along. You have to come. It will be just like our childhoods when we spent summers together. And you can start over in England. The palace is too insular. You need to be out in the world.\u201d</p><p>Yasmin waxed on and on about all the things they could do in London. They would shop, go to the theater, hang out with Oliver\u2019s brothers. One was a very famous football player, and Yas was convinced that Alea should go on a date with him.</p><p>The idea curdled her stomach. Alea backed up, her hip bumping the ledge of the balcony. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Landon surge toward her. She quickly edged away from the ledge lest Lan decide she meant to escape Yas by jumping to her death or something equally dramatic. He would think of it as his sacred duty to either save her or go down with her, no doubt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to love Callum. He\u2019s so handsome, and he\u2019s just a bit younger than my Oliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYas, stop. I don\u2019t know that I want to leave the palace right now.\u201d</p><p>When her cousin pursed her lips, preparing an argument, Alea knew she had to come up with some excuse or Yasmin really would set her up with an athlete. The paparazzi already swarmed her on those few occasions she ventured out in public. They called her the \u201cPrisoner Princess.\u201d Tal had managed to keep the gritty details of her kidnapping out of the press. The world believed she\u2019d simply been held in a gilded cage until the royal family had coughed up enough cash. If they knew the truth, they would call her the \u201cProstitute Princess.\u201d The very idea made her stomach turn.</p><p>Oliver put a hand on his wife\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBack off a bit, Yas. You\u2019ve just thrown a lot of information her way. Give her some time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy for me, are you?\u201d Yasmin stared at her, her doe eyes more than a little sad.</p><p>\u201cO-of course I am,\u201d Alea stuttered. \u201cI\u2019m just surprised.\u201d</p><p>And a bit annoyed, which made her feel guilty. Yas merely meant to help. But she just wanted peace. Why had she and Oliver sought her on this balcony? Alea had enjoyed the quiet of her and Lan sharing the space alone.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you would be happy for me, too. I\u2019m sorry, Lea. Oliver was right. You\u2019re still in a dark place, and I didn\u2019t realize... This is all my fault.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned and fled the balcony, her dress floating around her ankles. Alea winced. Oliver cursed under his breath. Yas had always been on the dramatic side. Pregnancy hormones probably weren\u2019t helping. Of course she wanted her cousin to be happy...but it was hard to feel joy about anything when she felt stuck in a rut defined by numbness, terror, and a slow-burning rage.</p><p>Oliver dragged a hand over his face. \u201cForgive her. She\u2019s missed you far more than she\u2019s let on. I swear she changed the day you went missing. She was quite manic for a while. I was worried we would have to sedate her those first few days. I think the wedding was the only thing that held her together. And now the baby is coming.\u201d</p><p>He said the last in a sort of resolved tone that led Alea to wonder if Oliver wasn\u2019t the one who was unhappy about the baby. \u201cAre you two in trouble?\u201d</p><p>Truthfully, Alea was surprised the couple had made it this far. She\u2019d had a bet with Kade that Oliver would bow out of the wedding. Yasmin, a drama diva, didn\u2019t seem like the right fit for the level-headed, stiff-upper-lip Brit.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been pregnant,\u201d Oliver admitted, his voice going low. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, Lea. I actually had plans to call off the wedding, but then you went missing, and Yasmin was expecting. I felt I had to honor the commitment. In some ways, I felt I had to honor it in order to honor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlea, you know I\u2019ve always had a thing for you, but you went off to New York...and I kind of fell in with Yas. We do all right, the two of us. We muddle through. She had a miscarriage shortly after our honeymoon. She\u2019s been obsessive about getting pregnant again ever since. Please take a little time and think about our offer. It really would do you good to get away from all this pomp and circumstance. I\u2019ve heard a rumor that Yasmin isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s pregnant. If it\u2019s true, the spotlights will only shine brighter on the palace.\u201d</p><p>Piper. She wasn\u2019t showing yet, either, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her condition from the press for long. There didn\u2019t seem to be a minute of the day that one of Piper\u2019s husbands didn\u2019t have a hand on her belly as though they could already feel the child growing there.</p><p>Alea wouldn\u2019t have children. She would grow old right here and be the pathetic old maid. No one could possibly want a woman as broken as she was. No one knew just how shattered she was on the inside. What man could handle that, even if she could bring herself to get close to him?</p> <p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re going to make the announcement in a few weeks, when Piper is past the first trimester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a madhouse, then. You must know that. The rags in England don\u2019t really give a damn about me unless I\u2019m hanging out with Wills. It\u2019s Callum they\u2019re interested in, and I promise, you don\u2019t have to date him. Though I\u2019ll warn you, he\u2019ll make you crazy about it, and when you relent, I\u2019ll likely be a bit jealous. Come on, Lea. I can protect you in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>But there was no way she belonged there. If she went, Yas and Oliver would mean well, but with a baby coming, as well as ties to both celebrities and royals, Alea knew she\u2019d find no peace. She was starting to think, however, that they were right about getting out of Bezakistan. Maybe a change of scenery would be good. Maybe she needed to be alone for a while, get her head together, weigh what she wanted in life against how brave she felt in pursuing it.</p><p>A long, painful moment passed. \u201cI suppose I should go and check on Yasmin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably so.\u201d</p> <p>With a nod, Oliver turned and walked out. Finally, Alea could breathe again.</p><p>\u201cDid you love him?\u201d</p><p>She turned, startled. Lan stood, his stern face expressionless. He could be so quiet, she\u2019d almost forgotten he was there. And he rarely asked questions. In fact, Landon could follow her for hours and never say a word.</p><p>\u201cNo. God, no. I was so young. I didn\u2019t love anyone except Robert Pattinson,\u201d she answered without thinking.</p><p>Oliver had been a pleasant companion, and they had gone on a few dates, but she hadn\u2019t even kissed him. She\u2019d been happy when she\u2019d discovered that he and Yasmin were dating. She\u2019d hoped Oliver would be a calming influence on her headstrong cousin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. Because he\u2019s an asshole.\u201d One minute Landon was a shadow clinging to the wall, and the next he was in her space, a mountain of lean muscle.</p><p>\u201cHe is not! What makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>Lan gave her an incredulous stare, as if wondering how she could miss the big picture. \u201cHe put the moves on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe did no such thing. He\u2019s never once tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersuading you to come home with him and saying he\u2019d be jealous if you dated the soccer player...yeah, his approach is mostly subtle, but he\u2019s still hitting on you. Even if he would never do anything about it, he\u2019s married, and that makes him a douche nozzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to help...in his way. His relationship with Yasmin is a little complicated.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d gotten married far too young, and she wasn\u2019t sure Yas was really ready to be a mom. \u201cShe\u2019s his wife. He should never talk to another woman that way. If I was married, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d He stared down at her, his expression soft and searching. She\u2019d never seen him look so gentle. \u201cDon\u2019t let them sway you from getting what you need to heal. They\u2019re trying to use you to buffer their drama. You don\u2019t need that, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>He hovered so close that she felt the heat radiating off his body. All it would take to press her lips to his was one simple lift to her toes. Then she\u2019d be brushing her mouth against his and know what it felt like to kiss a man again. She hadn\u2019t kissed anyone in years it seemed. No soft brushing of her mouth against another\u2019s. No arms that wound protectively around her. Just pain and terror. Memories flashed through her head of vicious fingers tangling in her hair, forcing her head back until her neck felt like it would break.</p><p>\u201cYou just went white. Are you all right?\u201d Landon reached out for her, but she wouldn\u2019t be able to endure his touch, not when she felt so dirty.</p><p>They could put her in a designer gown, but she was still the girl who knew what it meant to be subjugated. She was still the dumb animal who had watched as the women around her were tortured, raped, and snuffed out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>He jerked back. \u201cI won\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t hurt you for the world. Take a deep breath. You\u2019re here in Bezakistan. You\u2019re at the palace. No one will ever hurt you here. Me, Dane, and Coop will make damn sure of it. Take a long breath. I\u2019ll do it with you.\u201d</p><p>He breathed in, his chest filling with air. He was so calm and kind that she found herself following his directions. When he reached for her this time, she let him take her hand. He held it until she stopped shaking.</p><p>God, she wanted him to hold her. She wanted what Piper had. She wanted to be surrounded by men who loved her, who accepted her...who could want her even after all that had happened.</p><p>Her captors had ensured she would never have any of that.</p><p>She gently pulled her hand from his, hating that moment they were no longer connected palm to palm. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, Alea. Tell me what just went through your head.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t matter how much she wanted to. She was never going to talk about it, especially to the three men she very nearly idolized. She was never going to tell anyone about her shame. \u201cThat\u2019s \u2018princess\u2019 or \u2018Your Highness,\u2019 please. It isn\u2019t seemly for you to call me by my first name.\u201d</p><p>Alea needed distance before she crumbled. In that panicked second, she didn\u2019t know how else to get it.</p><p>But when she saw his face in the next moment, she cared very much. Her heart ached as Landon drew back, his shoulders squaring and his eyes icing over. \u201cI apologize, Your Highness. Like I said, I\u2019m just a dumb grunt. Sometimes I forget my place. Perhaps we should go back to the party.\u201d</p><p>The urge to apologize and tell him everything swamped her. The impulsive need to bring Dane and Cooper in and confess everything, release all her pain to them, tempted her. But the past was her private hell. They were not only protectors, but kind ones, and she couldn\u2019t take advantage of that, imagining that her own feelings for them in any way mirrored theirs for her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have them, and they wouldn\u2019t want her\u2014even if she was brave enough to try.</p><p>Landon opened the door, and music spilled out into the night. Alea followed him back into the ballroom. Instantly, friends and family surrounded her, yet she still felt utterly alone.</p><p>Dane Mitchell cursed under his breath as Alea walked into the ballroom followed by a sullen Landon. To an outsider, Lan\u2019s frown wouldn\u2019t look any different than normal, but Dane had been around the Texan long enough to know when he was in a real shit-kicker of a mood. Lan\u2019s shoulders were too square and tight, his movements lacking their normal grace, to be anything but pissed off. Dane had little doubt it was something the prickly princess had said.</p><p>\u201cDayum, what do you think happened out there?\u201d Coop\u2019s voice came over Dane\u2019s earpiece. \u201cLan\u2019s doing his whole \u2018stony soldier\u2019 routine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea.\u201d But something had happened, and it had affected Alea, too. She\u2019d pressed her mouth into a grim line and looked close to tears.</p><p>Stopping at the edge of the ballroom, she drew in a breath and collected herself. Oh, it looked to most as if she was merely smoothing her dress down and checking her hair in one of the ornate mirrors that lined the hallway, but Dane knew better. If she\u2019d listen, he\u2019d tell her that she looked stunning. He\u2019d tried to tell her about a hundred times that she was the most gorgeous woman on the face of the fucking planet, but she always demurred. He would have comforted her, but she\u2019d just shut him down and push him away. Same as always.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Lan would have suggested that she find the rest of her bodice, do you? Because we all agreed that was likely a damn fine way to lose our balls,\u201d Coop joked.</p><p>When she\u2019d first walked out of her room earlier in the evening, it had been right there on the tip of his tongue to order her back inside to find a dress that actually covered her breasts. Luckily Coop had known he was about to unleash his inner Dominant on a woman who wasn\u2019t ready to handle the demand. Coop had slapped him on the back, shooting him a glance that warned Dane he was about to make an idiot of himself. Into the silence, Coop had loudly proclaimed to Alea that she looked beautiful. She\u2019d taken that to mean her dress, then explained that someone named Narciso had designed it. Dane didn\u2019t give a shit. Narciso needed to learn how to sew a proper top into his wretchedly expensive evening gowns.</p><p>Lan had just kind of drooled.</p><p>Alea had finally cracked a smile as she lifted her gown a fraction and showed off her ridiculously hot shoes. Then all Dane could think about was just how nice those stilettos would look wrapped around his neck as he drove his cock deep. And then she\u2019d utterly shut down as though she\u2019d realized she\u2019d sought their opinions and enjoyed their attention. After that, she\u2019d straightened her gown and dismissed them with a wave of her hand.</p><p>He was getting real damn tired of Alea always pushing them away. If he believed for a minute that she didn\u2019t want them, he would take a mental step back and protect her from afar. But he\u2019d noticed the way she sometimes watched all three of them when she thought no one was looking.</p><p>Now, Lan stood a good ten feet behind her, watching her as she visibly calmed herself. She turned to him and said something, her hands coming up in a little plea.</p><p>\u201cOh, here we go. I\u2019ve lived this scene before. Allow me. \u2018Don\u2019t follow me, Lan. Please, let me get my gorgeous self horribly murdered by the first psycho who comes along. It\u2019s my right.\u2019\u201d Coop sometimes provided offbeat dialogue when they were too far away to hear the object of their affection actually speak.</p><p>Landon had moved past Dane, but he could still see the way his friend moved his head in a sharp, unmistakable shake. Coop continued his translation. \u201cAnd then Lan says, in his too often verbose diatribe against her stubbornness, \u2018no.\u2019 You know, I think the dude should explain himself from time to time. Oh, look, he got the designer shoe stomp.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, Princess Alea stomped her right foot, threw her hands up, and stalked off, tossing open the door to the ballroom and flooding the hall briefly with glittering lights. Dane saw the way Lan sighed and opened the door again, his stare following her as he pursued.</p><p>Dane\u2019s hand twitched, and he made a fist to quell his urge to smack her sexy but rebellious little ass. \u201cI swear to god, Coop, sometimes I want to lay that girl over my knee and not let her up until we\u2019ve reached an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly sometimes, Dane?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nope. Pretty much all the time. From the minute he\u2019d seen Princess Alea Binte al Mussad, his cock had been hard and his heart had taken a nosedive. She\u2019d hit him like a bolt of lightning. He\u2019d stood there staring at her, feeling like a damn fool, but he wasn\u2019t going to let that stop him. Then he\u2019d looked at his two best friends, ready to tell them that he\u2019d finally found the one woman he wanted to put a collar on\u2014as crazy as that would have sounded\u2014and realized they were just as head over heels. That quickly, all three of them were fucked.</p><p>But they had all backed off, unwilling to step on each others\u2019 toes. They had been through too much together. Coop and Lan were the only family Dane had left. Oh, there was a father and three brothers back in Georgia, but he\u2019d come back from the Korengal Valley a different man. Shortly after his second tour, the family drama and his divorce had ended any affection or allegiance they had for him. In their head, Dane was as good as dead. Coop and Lan were his brothers now, and he couldn\u2019t fight with them. They had been at an impasse.</p><p>Until they had really understood the way relationships worked here in Bezakistan. It was tradition among the wealthy and the landholders in this small country for the brothers of a family to share a wife so they didn\u2019t have to divide the family riches or leave any sibling to suffer poverty. After a few weeks, Dane had decided they could adopt the Bezakistani way. He, Lan, and Coop might not truly share blood and they might not be preserving a fortune, but they all wanted Alea and weren\u2019t willing to stab a brother in the back to have her.</p><p>So after a full month here, he\u2019d decided he liked the idea of sharing. The families in Bezakistan seemed happy, and he wouldn\u2019t have to relinquish his backup. He\u2019d spent the majority of his adult life in the military, his whole childhood before that following his dad from base to base. The idea of having a family that functioned as a team really suited him.</p> <p>And then just as they\u2019d settled everything between the three of them, they realized they had forgotten to talk to the most important member of the team. And Alea didn\u2019t want anything to do with them. Or at least that was her story, and she seemed to be sticking to it.</p><p>Landon touched his earpiece and suddenly his voice came on the line. \u201cI want you to do a background check on that British fucker, Oliver Thurston-Hughes. Get me everything you can. I want to know it all, right down to what the asshole eats for breakfast so I\u2019ll know what to poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down,\u201d Coop said. \u201cWhy are we going to poison that Brit\u2019s oatmeal? Do they even eat oatmeal in England?\u201d</p><p>Lan ignored the question, getting right to the point. \u201cHe\u2019s a little too interested in the princess.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. If he was calling her \u201cprincess,\u201d then their conversation had been a clusterfuck. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Lan?\u201d</p> <p>His pal didn\u2019t look back. Instead, Lan stared across the ballroom, never taking his eyes off her. \u201cThat cousin of hers is trying to get her to go to England. The princess walked out onto the balcony to get some fresh air. First Mr. Small Dick followed her, then Crazy Bitch crashed the party. They laid all kinds of guilt on Her Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to England.\u201d There was no way Dane would allow it. Especially now that he was pretty sure she was still in potential danger. He would talk Talib into putting her on lockdown if he needed to. And if, for some reason, she left anyway, he would have to quit and follow her because he couldn\u2019t leave her unprotected and alone.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she really wants to go,\u201d Landon replied. \u201cBut the British fuckwad sure seemed interested in her being a bit more than a traveling companion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got a shot, boss. I can take him out in one,\u201d Coop said, his voice serious.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a damn fine idea, Coop,\u201d Landon interjected. \u201cCan you aim for his pecker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, brother. I suspect that is a mighty small target, but I\u2019m a damn fine marksman.\u201d</p> <p>Dane hated it when he had to be the voice of reason. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him. Not here anyway. I\u2019ll run a check on him, guys, but seriously, we can\u2019t go around assassinating every man who looks at her twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. We\u2019re good at assassinations. If Tal had let us take out Khalil when we wanted to, we could have avoided a whole lot of heartache.\u201d Coop sighed over the line. \u201cAre our \u2018friends\u2019 here yet?\u201d</p><p>Lawson and Riley Anders were private investigators with the prestigious Anthony Anders firm. It was made up of the brothers, Lawson and Riley, and a badass named Dominic Anthony. They had come with the highest references from the two PIs who had tracked down Alea when she\u2019d been kidnapped. Burke and Cole Lennox were good, but they also had married a really sweet girl named Jessa and now had one son with another on the way. They couldn\u2019t do the kind of twenty-four seven work that Dane had demanded after the death of Khalil al Bashir.</p><p>With the prime suspect dead, he had to know once and for all if Khalil had been the one responsible for Alea\u2019s abduction. In fact, he prayed that Khalil had been the guilty fucker. That would set his mind at ease. But it didn\u2019t add up.</p><p>The report the Lennox brothers had filed had stated plainly that Alea had been held for months in a state of \u201ctraining.\u201d She\u2019d been moved from New York to Colombia and housed in a brothel. Yet the physician who had treated her after she\u2019d been returned to Bezakistan had said there was no sexual abuse evident. According to him, Alea remained a virgin.</p><p>So he feared the random act of slavery was bullshit. Dane\u2019s guess was that someone had paid for her to be taken. Someone had wanted her to disappear and suffer. Money had been on the line. Money and maybe something else. Revenge? Pride? He couldn\u2019t be sure until he had more information.</p><p>Once, Khalil had seemed like the best suspect, but Dane hadn\u2019t been able to connect him yet to the crime either via physical evidence or motive. He prayed that Law and Riley gave him the proof tonight. He would be thrilled to find out that Alea\u2019s abduction had been a random act or that the asshole who had sold her out was dead.</p><p>But it felt too fucking easy.</p> <p>Dane shook off his suspicions and brought himself back to reality, answering Coop about Riley and Lawson. \u201cI have confirmation that they landed about half an hour ago. They should be here any minute. It\u2019s bad timing, but this is the best window they could give us, given the tight schedule Dominic keeps.\u201d Plus, if the perp was still alive, he might well be attending tonight\u2019s event and wouldn\u2019t notice a few more visitors to the palace that might raise suspicion. \u201cWe\u2019re going to meet in Tal\u2019s office to go over what they\u2019ve learned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t someone notice if the sheikh disappears from his wife\u2019s coronation ball?\u201d Coop asked.</p><p>\u201cNot for a few minutes. We\u2019re going to make this short and sweet. Rafe and Kade will keep Piper occupied.\u201d In fact, Tal planned to give Rafe the signal, who would then make sure their wife was occupied on the dance floor until the meeting adjourned. The goal was to keep the party rolling as normally as possible so as not to alert Piper\u2014or Alea\u2014that anything potentially dangerous might be going down. If the news was bad, as Dane suspected, they would need a whole new game plan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on Her Highness,\u201d Lan said.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did she say to you, buddy?\u201d Coop asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing I didn\u2019t already know,\u201d Landon grumbled over the radio.</p><p>Dane was getting a headache. Nothing was going the way he\u2019d planned. From the moment he and his friends had made a pact to go after Alea as a team, Dane had been sure they would succeed. He\u2019d told himself back then it wouldn\u2019t take more than a few months before she was surrounded by them, before they overwhelmed her. Over a year had passed, and he was starting to believe she would never be ready for a romance, much less one that involved three men.</p><p>And he was beginning to understand that he might never be complete without her.</p><p>The doors from the main hallway opened, and two tall, well-built men walked through. Law and Riley Anders hadn\u2019t bothered with tuxedos. They were dressed casually in jeans and T-shirts. One wore a blazer and the other a leather jacket. Even though the palace was in the heart of the desert, it got cold at night.</p><p>The brothers nodded to each other and turned toward Dane. He quickly sized them up. Lawson Anders was just a slight bit taller than his younger brother, but there was a coldness to his eyes that Dane recognized. Law had spent time in the military, likely in black ops, though his dossier claimed he\u2019d only been a communications officer. Bullshit. The man in front of him had obviously seen and done too much. \u201cCommunications\u201d was code for \u201ctoo classified to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Riley Anders had gone the college route. Burke Lennox swore Riley was one of the premier hackers in the United States. It was a skill that would mean the world to an investigator. There was a lighter air to him, but Dane didn\u2019t doubt he\u2019d been trained well.</p><p>\u201cLieutenant Mitchell?\u201d Lawson asked.</p><p>Dane winced inwardly. How fucking long would it be before he could hear military titles and not have his stomach go south? \u201cIt\u2019s just Dane. I\u2019m not in the Navy anymore.\u201d</p><p>Law leaned against the wall. \u201cYeah, from what I hear, you got a bad fucking rap. But I understand. I got out because I couldn\u2019t listen to the brass anymore, either. Now Dominic is the only person who bitches at me. I\u2019m the idiot who gets his ass out of the military, then goes to work for his former CO.\u201d</p><p>Riley shrugged. \u201cWell, I\u2019m the smart one who didn\u2019t go into the military in the first place and I still end up getting my ass chewed out on a regular basis by your former CO.\u201d</p><p>Dane didn\u2019t have time for the Anders brothers comedy hour. \u201cDo you have the information I asked for? I don\u2019t understand why Dominic wouldn\u2019t just send it to me. I could have saved you a very long flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDominic never likes to give bad news over the phone.\u201d Lawson glanced down at the briefcase his brother carried. \u201cDo you have some place where we can set up?\u201d</p><p>A knot formed in his stomach, and Dane wondered if he was really braced for the truth.</p><p>\u201cShould I give Tal the signal?\u201d Cooper asked him over the radio.</p><p>From the edge of the ballroom, Landon looked back. He stood in the shadows, watching over the woman they all loved. The woman who might still be in danger. Dane gave him a nod, and Landon edged closer to Alea. He would keep an eye on her so Dane and Coop could take this meeting.</p><p>\u201cDane?\u201d</p><p>He was procrastinating. \u201cYeah. Get everyone into Talib\u2019s office pronto.\u201d</p><p>With a nod to the private investigators, Dane began to lead the way to a more private part of the palace. Behind him the brothers chattered on, throwing more annoying digs at one another.</p><p>Dane was grim as he unlocked the office and turned on the light. It was past time to find out just how screwed they all were.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Lan looked out over the ballroom and tried to imagine himself belonging here. It was an impossible task.</p><p>Alea held out her hand, greeting some big wig. Schmoozing was probably politically important, but all he gave a shit about was that her smile didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. He hated to see her so withdrawn. When she didn\u2019t realize he was watching her, she gave in to pure joy. Then her dark eyes glittered and her pillowy lips curved into a smile that could light up the whole fucking world.</p><p>But now she was faking it, flashing that annoyingly bland smile to the crowd, which she often did to people who didn\u2019t matter. When she didn\u2019t want anyone to look at her too closely. He didn\u2019t even mind the little fit she\u2019d thrown earlier because at least when she was pissed off at him, she was being honest. He would take her anger over nonchalance any day of the week.</p><p>But she was right about one thing: he was a dumbshit who didn\u2019t deserve her. He needed to remember that. He was here to do a job, which meant protecting her, period. No matter how much he wanted to take her in his arms and love her until she couldn\u2019t think about anything else, she was a princess. He was pure Texas trailer trash. He was nowhere near Alea\u2019s league.</p><p>\u201cDoes Rafe have the target?\u201d Dane asked over the tiny device in his ear.</p><p>Lan quickly found the man they were talking about. Rafe took Piper\u2019s hand, kissing it as he started to lead the shaykhah to the dance floor. The music had changed from a bouncy song to a long, slow grind. That was baby-making music, and Rafe grinned wolfishly at his wife.</p><p>Alea stopped and looked out to the floor, longing plain on her face. God, he wanted to walk over to her, thread his fingers through hers, lead her out there. But he also wanted his two best friends to be there touching her, too. And that made him a fucking freak in most of the world. Bezakistan was different, so in Lan\u2019s book, that\u2019s what made the country great.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got her.\u201d Piper was following Rafe onto the dance floor, her face shining up at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcellent. Keep an eye on our brat. I\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re done. Out.\u201d Coop\u2019s voice cut off, and Lan knew he was out of the loop for a bit. He\u2019d volunteered for this duty to remove himself from the meeting. He\u2019d rather watch over Alea because he didn\u2019t agree with this clandestine shit. Everyone was planning Alea\u2019s life without including her. She should be in that fucking meeting, but he\u2019d been outvoted.</p><p>Rafe and Piper started a slow dance. Kade walked up behind them, putting his hands on Piper\u2019s waist and leaning over to kiss the back of her neck.</p><p>Those two had backup. Even if anything ever happened to Rafe or Kade, Piper al Mussad would never be alone. If one of them went down, she would have two more husbands to lean on. They would protect the woman they loved. He\u2019d heard sad stories about some of the widows of guys he\u2019d served with in the Army. Once their husbands were dead, they were often utterly alone. So many became single moms, struggling to make ends meet because they didn\u2019t have anyone else in their corner.</p><p>\u201cNix, how you doing?\u201d A deep voice asked behind him.</p> <p>He turned and saw one of the Lennox brothers holding out his hand. Lan took it and tried to give him a smile. The other man tried to return the gesture, mostly baring his teeth in return.</p><p>Cole and Burke were near perfect twins, but Lan had quickly learned that Burke was the one who smiled. It wasn\u2019t that Cole was always grim. He could light up when his wife walked in the room, but otherwise, he was a little standoffish. \u201cGoing good, Cole. Dane\u2019s meeting with your guys right now.\u201d</p><p>Lennox nodded. \u201cGood. Dominic runs a tight ship. They\u2019ll get you what you need. Sorry I couldn\u2019t handle it personally, but this pregnancy has been giving Jessa hell for a couple of months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s perfectly good now.\u201d A gorgeous redhead threaded her arm through Cole\u2019s and turned her face up to his. \u201cI just needed to get through the vomiting-up-my-toenails phase.\u201d</p><p>There was that smile of Cole\u2019s. Lan watched, a knot of jealousy in the pit of his stomach. He hated this envy. He didn\u2019t want Jessa or begrudge Cole his happiness. He just wanted a little of his own.</p> <p>\u201cJessa!\u201d Alea\u2019s smile turned genuine as she approached the auburn beauty. What he wouldn\u2019t give to have that smile directed at him...</p><p>\u201cI heard you were here,\u201d the princess said. \u201cHow is baby Caleb?\u201d</p><p>Lan supposed it had been inevitable that Alea would become close to her saviors\u2019 wife. Alea\u2019s friendship with Jessa made her happy. As far as Lan was concerned, that pretty much was all he needed to know about the woman. If Alea loved her, then she had to be good people, as his granny would say.</p><p>He watched as Alea talked to her friend, her posture relaxed for once. Cole\u2019s brother, Burke sauntered up, sliding his arm around Jessa\u2019s waist as they chatted with Alea.</p><p>When everyone was occupied, Cole\u2019s face turned serious. With an almost imperceptible cock of the head, he motioned Lan to follow him. They stepped out of the conversation, just far enough so they couldn\u2019t be overheard.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you and Alea?\u201d Cole asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m her bodyguard. That\u2019s it.\u201d And that was where it would stay because she had zero interest in him.</p><p>\u201cBullshit. Do you think I don\u2019t have eyes? I saw the way you looked at her. Man, I\u2019m not trying to mess with you. I like very few people. Alea is one of them. You\u2019re one of them. That girl is still in trouble. Even if Dominic\u2019s guys found out that Khalil was the one behind her kidnapping and she\u2019s out of danger, she\u2019s still in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Because she hadn\u2019t gotten over what had happened during her abduction. How was she supposed to get over that? She wouldn\u2019t let them see her fear or pain, so how the fuck were they supposed to help her?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a damn thing I can do. She doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she into one of your crew?\u201d Cole\u2019s face creased as though he was thinking through a problem.</p><p>\u201cNo. She doesn\u2019t like any of us.\u201d Would it be better or worse if she wanted Dane or Coop? Maybe. At least someone would be happy.</p><p>\u201cAgain, I call bullshit. The minute we stepped over here, she started casting glances this way, and she\u2019s not staring at me.\u201d</p><p>Lan let his eyes slide toward her. Sure enough, Alea jerked her gaze back to Jessa Lennox as quickly as she could. In fact, a little crowd had formed around her now, as Jessa and Alea had been joined by a familiar, pretty blonde, Hannah James. Her husbands, the James brothers, ran Black Oak Oil and had long-standing ties with the Bezakistani royal family.</p> <p>Husbands. It seemed like everyone was getting on the marital bandwagon lately. Everyone except the one woman who had grown up surrounded by plural marriage.</p><p>\u201cYou were with her those first few days after you rescued her, right?\u201d Lan asked.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d Cole\u2019s tone turned grim.</p><p>\u201cHow bad was she?\u201d He\u2019d read the medical reports, but they were clinical. Sure, he knew the date of her kidnapping, where she\u2019d been held, when she\u2019d been rescued. He knew she\u2019d been tortured. But none of that really explained the ordeal that had shaped the woman he knew now.</p><p>\u201cUnimaginable. Look, she should be the one to tell you, but I\u2019m starting to worry that she\u2019ll never confide in anyone. She looks healthy now. She\u2019s a hundred and eighty degrees from the skinny, drug-addicted girl I carried out of that brothel. In fact, she looks great, until I see her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs?\u201d Nowhere in those fucking reports had anyone mentioned drugs. Alea would never have done that of her own free will. She was so proud and seemingly in control. So...fuck. Her captors had drugged her. Hell, just how much of her soul had they taken?</p><p>\u201cShit. I\u2019d hoped Tal would have let you in on that since you\u2019re her bodyguard.\u201d Cole groaned a little. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my ass kicked, but Tal, Rafe, and Kade are treating her with kid gloves. She\u2019s drifting. I know they think they\u2019re sheltering her, but someone has to push that girl to open up. Look, I understand the impulse to stay out of things. I really do, but if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about getting people to heal...sometimes you gotta give them a shove. You can\u2019t just hope people will change all by themselves. If you care about Alea, you have to pry her open, man. She\u2019s not made of glass. That woman fought like hell in that brothel. She fought to get off the drugs. Maybe she just needs a little help from someone to help her fight for her future.\u201d</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t he love to be that someone? \u201cMan, she\u2019d just fight me, too.\u201d</p><p>Lan stared at her openly now, not even trying to disguise his longing. He didn\u2019t give a shit what anyone else thought. He was in love with that woman. She would never love him back. They came from different worlds. She was a princess, and he had no idea who his father was.</p><p>But maybe sometimes love wasn\u2019t about getting what he wanted. Maybe sacrifice was really at the heart of it. If he pushed her, fought for her, maybe she could tear down that tough-girl mask and find a way to be happy\u2014even if it wasn\u2019t with him, Dane, and Coop.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to fight her too hard. Just push a little every day. Talk to her. Don\u2019t let up and don\u2019t let her force you to the side. I know how this goes. Jessa tried her hardest to shove us out of her life. She said some horrible things to me. It hurt, but then I realized she was both lashing out and testing us. Burke and I had hurt her when we\u2019d left her alone. She had to push until she realized we weren\u2019t going to disappear again, no matter what. Nothing she could say or do was going to throw us out of her life. Alea might have the same M.O.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never been with Alea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>Lan felt himself flush. Damn it. \u201cWe all have feelings for her, me, Dane, and Coop. We thought we could pursue her together, but she wasn\u2019t interested in us, either together or apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr she\u2019s scared that none of you can accept what she\u2019s been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe survived. That\u2019s the only thing that matters. Why wouldn\u2019t we accept that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvival is a funny thing, man, and you damn well know it. When you\u2019re down in the trenches all that matters is living, but it\u2019s not so simple once you return to the real world. People judge you. You measure what you did to live against conventional social mores...and suddenly what once seemed like a simple choice is murky and gray.\u201d</p><p>He knew exactly what Cole was talking about.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s when you have to deal with the reality that you lived and some didn\u2019t,\u201d Cole went on. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have to accept who the fuck you really are.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought about it that way before. Alea was a survivor, but she had a heart. How guilty did she feel for getting out alive when others hadn\u2019t? How ashamed was she by whatever she\u2019d had to do in order to live? She\u2019d been through a war of sorts, and he had no idea how much of herself she\u2019d lost along the way.</p><p>The fact that Alea had survived and could function now proved how strong she was. She deserved better than to be treated like some fragile doll who couldn\u2019t make a decision about her own life. Despite what all the other guys thought, she could handle the truth. Being in control of her future might even help her heal from the past.</p><p>Lan knew what he had to do. \u201cWell, hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get my ass kicked. I hate getting my ass kicked.\u201d He steeled himself. If he was going to start fighting for his princess, he might as well start now.</p><p>\u201cNo one ever tries to kick my ass anymore,\u201d Cole grumbled.</p><p>Resolved, Lan stalked back to Alea, his heart chugging. Right here, right now, he was going to change everything. Yeah, he should probably wait. If he wanted to play on a team, he shouldn\u2019t make decisions alone. But he wasn\u2019t risking that Dane and Coop would hate the plan and try to shut him down. Alea deserved to know what was going on.</p><p>\u201cLandon?\u201d Alea\u2019s eyes widened as he reached for her hand.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Princess. We\u2019ve got a meeting to attend.\u201d</p><p>She began to protest, her words saying one thing, while her fingers said another. Maybe he was going about this all wrong, but as he led her out of the ballroom, Lan could have sworn she squeezed his hand, holding on tight.</p><p>Cooper held the door open for Sheikh Talib al Mussad and wondered if they were doing the right thing. Alea needed peace and to believe she was safe. He didn\u2019t like the idea of worrying her just because they had a gut instinct that could be wrong. If his hunch was on the money, they\u2019d handle it so she could be none the wiser. Right?</p><p>Tal strode into the room where Dane and the Anders brothers had already set up. There were seats with a folder in front of each.</p><p>The investigation into Alea\u2019s abduction. God, he almost didn\u2019t want to know what that file said. A part of him wanted to pretend that the past was behind them all, that she was healing even now, and merely playing coy and hard to get.</p><p>But he knew better. Alea had been ground under some fucker\u2019s boot, and deep down Coop needed to know who he could blame so he\u2019d have someone to kill. He\u2019d finally found the girl who made his heart pound, and she was broken because of this asshole. Or maybe there was more than one asshole. Shooting multiple criminals wouldn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>The tall dude at the front of the room slipped out of his blazer and took a seat at the head of the table. \u201cIf you will all take a seat, we can go over the findings fairly quickly and get the sheikh back to his ball. My name is Riley Anders, and I\u2019m the research expert at Anthony Anders. This is my brother, Lawson. He\u2019s pure muscle so don\u2019t expect him to actually talk. He prefers to grunt.\u201d</p><p>Law sat beside him, straddling the back of a chair, and flipped his brother the finger.</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019re civilized,\u201d he muttered as he took a seat next to Dane.</p><p>Dane leaned over, talking behind his hand. \u201cNo doubt. But according to the Lennox brothers, these guys are the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish we\u2019d done the investigation ourselves.\u201d</p><p>Dane shook his head. \u201cWe wanted the best. Alea deserves it. After they tell us the news, then we take over. We can either give her the good news that Khalil was the one who had her kidnapped or we quietly take down the motherfucker who did. That, my friend, is a job we will do ourselves and relish.\u201d</p><p>Because they damn straight were the best at killing someone who needed to die.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll open your folders, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve done a very thorough investigation of the princess\u2019s abduction. Since we were not allowed to interview Princess Alea, it\u2019s incomplete,\u201d Riley pointed out with a tight smile.</p><p>Tal scowled. \u201cI\u2019ve explained this. You have everything you need in the reports.\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDo we? Those reports seem a bit sanitized. There are no real details about what happened to her while she was held.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBad shit,\u201d Dane shot back. \u201cWhat the fuck more do you need to know?\u201d</p><p>Riley glared. \u201cShut the testosterone off and get real. We need to know everything. We\u2019re not here to judge the princess. We\u2019re here to figure out who plotted her kidnapping. Knowing what she endured during her captivity might provide clues.\u201d</p><p>Tal leaned forward intently, his jaw tight. \u201cAre you telling me you know this wasn\u2019t random? Alea is a beautiful girl. Isn\u2019t it possible that she was taken and held for the highest bidder? It makes sense that she\u2019d be targeted because she hid her wealth. The person who nabbed her might have believed she wasn\u2019t protected.\u201d</p><p>Law\u2019s head shook, shooting down Tal\u2019s earnest hope. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat my brother means to say is that we have proof to the contrary. Turn to page five of the file. It\u2019s a photocopy of the note that brought Alea to the club that night. It was found amongst her things from New York,\u201d Riley said quietly, the very somberness of his voice an answer to the question.</p><p>Meet me at 7 at the Jackson Club downtown. Please. I need help.</p><p>It was unsigned, but the stationary was unmistakable. It had come from the Bezakistani embassy in New York.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen and discussed this note.\u201d Dane sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. She must have believed she knew who wrote it. Whoever\u2019s behind her abduction knew she would respond to a request from the embassy. It stands to reason this person knew exactly who she was and targeted her. Motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question is why,\u201d Riley said, then turned to Tal. \u201cYou never received a ransom note?\u201d</p> <p>The sheikh shook his head. \u201cNo. I would have paid. I would have paid anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they weren\u2019t after money,\u201d Dane concluded.</p><p>Riley shrugged a little. \u201cWe can\u2019t be completely sure of that, but there\u2019s one other reason we\u2019re convinced this wasn\u2019t random. If we were just dealing with slavers filling an order, she would have been raped about ten minutes after her kidnapping. You\u2019ve read the medical file. You know that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s whole body had stiffened. Coop wasn\u2019t any happier. When they had first heard Alea\u2019s story, he, Dane, and Lan had sat down and talked. Even if she hadn\u2019t been raped, she\u2019d been through a lot. They had backed off physically because of it. Coop had started reading about the psychology of victims, trying to understand.</p><p>Law frowned. \u201cFrom what we\u2019ve been able to tell, Alea was brutalized in every other way imaginable. They left her virginity intact for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Tal slapped at the table. \u201cDo we have to talk about this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe information won\u2019t leave this room,\u201d Coop vowed. \u201cBut you asked us to be responsible for Alea\u2019s well-being. It\u2019s hard to do that if we don\u2019t talk about information that might be relevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is none of anyone\u2019s business, even yours. I tasked you with making sure she doesn\u2019t get hurt again. That\u2019s all.\u201d Tal glowered.</p><p>Ouch. That hurt like a bitch. But Coop refused to back down. \u201cKnowing what she endured may tell us what happened to her and why, so yeah, I think it\u2019s my business. I also happen to think that protecting her life is more important than protecting her modesty. She\u2019s not just a job to me. She\u2019s a good woman who deserves to close her eyes at night and sleep soundly, knowing that she\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Tal drew in a calming breath. \u201cSorry. You\u2019re right. I know how you all feel about her. I\u2019ve seen how Alea reacts to you three. I asked you here for a reason, and it wasn\u2019t as her security team.\u201d</p><p>That was news to Coop. The last he\u2019d heard, the sheikh had reminded all three of them of their completely non-royal status. Dane had gone the \u201cI hate authority\u201d route, while Lan had slid into his whole \u201cwoe is me/I grew up in a trailer so no woman can love me\u201d pile of shit. Coop...he\u2019d seen the play for what it was at the time.</p><p>Back then, Tal had been in a bad place with Piper. He\u2019d been a bear growling at anything that even halfway moved. Dane wasn\u2019t known for his subtlety. Lan sometimes stepped in it\u2014when he bothered to speak at all. So they\u2019d made nice, big targets for the sheikh. When Coop had written off Tal\u2019s craptastic mood and snarling outburst to not getting any, Dane and Lan had called him an overly optimistic Pollyanna and told him to shut the fuck up.</p><p>Coop shrugged. He was realistic, thank you. The other two could be morose morons. But they were his family.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Your Highness?\u201d Dane asked, his jaw squaring in that comic book, all-American hero way of his.</p> <p>Tal turned to Dane. Coop\u2019s stomach rolled. Here it came, the big emotional \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d scene that had been building for six months. Fuck. Coop hadn\u2019t gone into the Navy so he could have the verbal equivalent of dude hugs. He\u2019d rather cut through the crap and put it behind them. \u201cLet me translate. Tal fucked up and he\u2019s sorry. He\u2019s cool if we go after Alea because he knows we\u2019ll take care of her. Now can we move this along?\u201d</p><p>Tal frowned Coop\u2019s way. \u201cThat\u2019s not exactly how I planned to say it, but yes. I had a very long apology planned, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we handle this like men?\u201d Coop asked. \u201cJust punch each other, then share a beer and we\u2019re all cool.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s lips curled up. \u201cSorry, Tal. Coop isn\u2019t a big believer in the whole \u2018emotional sharing\u2019 thing. I think it\u2019s because he grew up surrounded by cattle.\u201d</p><p>Coop shrugged. Sometimes he missed his dad\u2019s ranch. \u201cI was raised by cowhands who were long on work and short on chatter. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>A huge smile crossed the sheikh\u2019s face. \u201cWell, Cooper was succinct, but correct. Alea needs you. I\u2019ve talked this over with my brothers, and we\u2019ve agreed that we will approve the marriage if you can convince her to accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d Coop smiled now. \u201cBut it\u2019s not fair. You had it easier. You got to steal a bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe followed in the tradition of our ancestors. They would whisk a woman away to someplace quiet and fuck her until she finally agreed to marry them,\u201d Tal said with a long sigh. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to be sneaky. I doubt Alea will prove as accommodating or as easily deceived as Piper. Plus, we had the whole language thing on our side. Unfortunately for you, Alea is proficient in five languages. I don\u2019t think she knows Swahili. Do any of you?\u201d</p><p>Coop rolled his eyes. \u201cI think we can all agree Alea is smarter than any of us. We\u2019re going to have to rely on how hot we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s worked so well for us up to this point.\u201d Dane rolled his eyes. \u201cSo please stop walking around in your boxers on the off chance that Alea will walk in, see your body, and fall at your feet.\u201d</p><p>He elbowed Dane. It could have worked.</p><p>Law yawned, looking generally bored. \u201cIf you guys are done with the huggy portion of the evening, we could move on.\u201d</p><p>Riley frowned at his brother. \u201cSorry, he\u2019s the emotional equivalent of a lobotomized pit bull. Now for the bad news. There is no indication that Khalil had anything to do with the kidnapping. In fact, we talked to the private investigators he hired to look for the princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tal asked, nearly coming out of his seat.</p><p>Coop was confused, too. Khalil had been a violent asswipe bent on destroying the whole family. \u201cHe hated his cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hated everyone in line for the throne. Alea isn\u2019t. And there\u2019s no doubt he hired a small firm in California to search for her. It was actually a smart play. Those particular investigators have deep ties in South America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be a ruse,\u201d Tal shot back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Yes, he could have used it to point suspicion away from him if you\u2019d thought he had something to do with the kidnapping. But it makes more sense to me that he would look for her so he could get his hands on her before you. That leverage might have been very interesting to a man like Khalil. Unfortunately for him, your investigators got there first,\u201d Riley explained. \u201cAnd the firm he hired doesn\u2019t know anything we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>So if Khalil hadn\u2019t been guilty, and the act hadn\u2019t been random, where did that leave them? Screwed. Everything inside Coop tightened. Knowing that the asshole behind Alea\u2019s torment was still free to plot against her again would feed his nightmares. Random, they could deal with. It sucked, but the Lennox brothers had taken vengeance out on the men who had actually grabbed Alea from her university. He, Dane, and Lan found comfort in that. Even Khalil as the mastermind made him feel better. That fucker was dead, and Coop knew that he and his buddies would watch over her and make sure nothing ever happened to her again.</p><p>But neither of the above wasn\u2019t what he wanted to hear.</p><p>\u201cSo you believe that Khalil was in the dark, too.\u201d Tal\u2019s fingers splayed across the table as he leaned forward and cursed in Arabic.</p><p>Riley continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a careful study of the flow of money of the abductors and the brothel where your cousin was held. It\u2019s all a bit of a nightmare. The brothel was owned by a man who had close ties to the Delgado Cartel. The money filtered through there, but when the Lennox brothers took down that cartel and killed the Delgados, it splintered into three different groups. Getting any kind of financials on a criminal organization is difficult. Scraping figures together on one in disarray is nearly impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you\u2019ve reached a dead end?\u201d Coop was already planning a trip to Colombia in his head. He would cut through all that red tape and just kill a bunch of fuckers until one told him what he needed to know.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m saying I\u2019m a genius and the world should really bow at my feet,\u201d Riley quipped with an arrogant smile.</p><p>Law made a vomiting sound. \u201cHe likes to build it all up so he looks good. All he did was play around with his computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuddite. I can cause more trouble with a few keystrokes than you can with all the guns in your arsenal. Now, I don\u2019t have it all figured out, but I do have a very interesting pattern of deposits and withdrawals. If you look on page sixteen, I\u2019ve documented what I\u2019ve got.\u201d Pages shuffled, and Riley went on. \u201cI\u2019ve managed to discern that the brothel\u2019s business transactions were handled by the owner\u2019s wife. It\u2019s all routine and in cash until two weeks after Alea\u2019s kidnapping. A wire transfer of twenty-five thousand hit a bank account the cartel used strictly for the brothels. Now, we all know they were selling women, but the same account then wires five thousand every ten days until two days before Alea was rescued.\u201d</p><p>Dane shook his head. \u201cLike...someone was paying for her upkeep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, they definitely overpaid. According to Cole, she was kept in horrible conditions,\u201d Tal muttered.</p><p>\u201cI think someone was paying them simply to keep her alive, Tal,\u201d Coop said darkly.</p><p>This twisted plot was far worse than he\u2019d imagined. Someone out there had paid to keep Alea tied up and drug addicted. Someone had wanted her held captive. But why?</p><p>\u201cWhere did that money come from?\u201d he demanded of Riley.</p><p>The PI paused. \u201cDirectly from a Cayman account, which was closed shortly after Alea was rescued. I\u2019m still looking for the records that indicate where and how the account was funded, but as you can imagine, the banking laws in the Caymans are beyond liberal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that we might never know.\u201d Dane scrubbed a hand over his hair. He\u2019d let it grow after he\u2019d left the Navy. Coop kept his in a military cut because it was easy, but that hair of Dane\u2019s seemed one way he distanced himself from his past.</p><p>Riley squared his big shoulders like he was ready for battle. Though he came across a bit like a geek, he was obviously in good shape and possessed a little badass. \u201cI will figure it out. I won\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s serious,\u201d Law explained. \u201cHe\u2019s pissed off now. He\u2019ll never quit. It\u2019s why Dominic sent us out here. We\u2019re going to go through some of the palace records. Some of them are kept on paper.\u201d</p><p>Riley shuddered. \u201cThat\u2019s barbaric, but I have to examine those records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting someone at the palace was behind the atrocity?\u201d Tal asked, clearly horrified by the prospect.</p><p>\u201cWe have to rule out every possibility,\u201d Riley said without a hint of apology in his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve already checked on everyone Princess Alea knew in New York, including all the employees at the embassy. I suspect that whoever is behind her abduction is someone she knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they try again?\u201d a soft, shaky voice asked from the shadowed doorway.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Alea walked into the light and stood like a gorgeous statue in her gown, her hair caught in a soft chignon that Coop wanted to run his hands through until all that midnight softness flowed around her shoulders. Her face was a tense mask. She had obviously heard far more than they wanted her to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dane touched the comm device that rested in his ear. \u201cLan, you\u2019re missing your charge, buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Lan stepped up behind her. His face was closed off as though he was just waiting for Dane\u2019s brutal judgment to fall down on his head. \u201cIt\u2019s her life. She has the right to know.\u201d</p><p>Coop winced. Hell, there was going to be a throw down now. He would be lucky if he managed to keep the ballsy Texan from losing his life, much less his job.</p><p>Alea walked into the room, her head held high. \u201cI caught wind of this little meeting and I threatened Landon. He didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p> <p>Dane\u2019s face had turned a spectacular shade of red. \u201cWhat exactly did you threaten him with, Princess? Were you going to use your nail file on him? Maybe you were going to throw one of your high heels at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be condescending. I threatened to tell my cousins that he\u2019d made a pass at me and have him fired if he didn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d Alea stood her ground even as Dane rose and stalked toward her.</p><p>Coop stood, too, because this could get out of hand very quickly. \u201cNow, Dane. Hold up. We should listen.\u201d</p><p>Dane towered over her. Her crazy-hot, four-inch heels were no match for his six and a half feet of pure muscle. Alea tilted her head back to look him in the eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t give him a choice, so if you have a problem with me being here, you really should talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Lan shook his head, and Coop knew he was about to do something stupid. \u201cShe didn\u2019t threaten me. Besides, everyone knows I hit on her all the time. I haven\u2019t gotten fired yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to be a problem anymore, Nix. Consider yourself officially fired. You can pack your bags and be out of here by morning.\u201d Dane turned to the rest of the room. \u201cGentlemen, I think we have everything we need. I\u2019m sure the sheikh will cooperate fully with the investigation.\u201d</p><p>Tal was sitting back in his chair, watching the drama unfold with curious eyes. \u201cNaturally, I will help in any way I can.\u201d</p><p>Alea wasn\u2019t through with Dane. She stomped one of those designer shoes as she followed him. \u201cYou can\u2019t fire Landon. I won\u2019t allow it. Tal, tell him.\u201d</p><p>The sheikh shrugged negligently. \u201cDane is in charge of security. He can hire and fire as he likes. But he might want to remember that there are more important things at stake than whether Landon followed orders.\u201d</p><p>Dane turned and glared at Lan, seemingly trying to intimidate the younger man and waiting for him to break, to ask for forgiveness.</p><p>And Alea was now looking through one of the folders, her skin turning pale as she caught sight of the pictures taken of her in the hospital after her rescue. That frail, gaunt creature looked nothing like the stunning beauty standing before him now. Her hand shook as she touched the picture.</p> <p>Lawson Anders stood up, shoving some file folders into his briefcase. \u201cTo answer your question, Princess, yes. My gut tells me that whoever is responsible will come after you again. They had a bleak future all planned for you, and it didn\u2019t involve you being rescued and coming home. I don\u2019t know why you weren\u2019t killed, but if someone wants to wipe you off the face of the Earth, I suspect they won\u2019t hesitate to snuff you out next time.\u201d</p><p>Alea\u2019s eyes fluttered, and her shoulders dropped. \u201cAnd you believe this is someone I know, someone I spend time with?\u201d</p><p>There was no hint of emotion in Lawson\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes. No idea who yet, but we\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>Tal cursed and glared at Law. \u201cDid you have to be quite so blunt?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he turned to Alea. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, looking drawn and still.</p><p>Straightening his tuxedo jacket, the sheikh cleared his throat, hiding a whole lot of pissed off. \u201cThen I\u2019m retiring back to the ballroom. I probably only have a few more hours of peace left. Once Piper finds out about this meeting, there will very likely be hell to pay. The good news is, she\u2019s adorable when she\u2019s mad. We\u2019ll leave the cleanup to you three. After all, you wanted to be responsible for her. Be careful what you wish for.\u201d</p><p>After Tal had gone, Alea swayed on her feet. Cooper moved across the room in a flash as her eyes closed and her body crumpled. He caught her just before she hit the floor and lifted her weight into his arms as if she was a precious burden. Dane and Lan stood right beside him, wearing matching expressions of concern.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d pictured holding her for the first time. But no matter. He held her close now, even as her eyes fluttered open.</p> <p>\u201cLea, you\u2019re going to be okay.\u201d Damn, was that his voice shaking?</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like to go to my room, Cooper. Could you please take me?\u201d She wasn\u2019t fighting him. He\u2019d expected her to struggle and tell him she could walk, but she let her arm drift up around his shoulders and she laid her head on his chest. She could probably hear his heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He glanced back at his friends. \u201cSomeone get my med kit.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for Dane and Lan to answer, he started out the door. If someone was still after Alea, it was time to start putting her first.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Alea dragged in a long breath as Cooper strode toward her private apartments. \u201cI changed my mind. You can let me down now. I need to talk to those investigators and look at that report.\u201d</p><p>She enjoyed being in his arms far too much. He made her feel delicate and feminine, loved and almost innocent. And it was all a lie.</p><p>\u201cNot until I\u2019ve examined you, Princess. You passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got woozy. I never lost consciousness.\u201d</p><p>No, but that would have been nice. She\u2019d been brutally aware of all of tonight\u2019s events. Her cousins, whom she trusted more than anyone in the world, had hired investigators and not bothered to mention it to her. Coop and Dane had gone along with the plan to keep her in the dark. When had they planned to tell her that someone was out there waiting for another chance to send her back to hell?</p><p>Cooper used his foot to kick the door open. \u201cYou were about to hit the floor.\u201d</p><p>Alea frowned. \u201cWell, the dress is tight.\u201d</p><p>She could barely breathe. Her evening gown hadn\u2019t been designed for comfort. And now she was a little worried that if she tried to take a deep breath, her breasts might peek or plop out.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should get out of it, but I\u2019m not leaving here until I know you\u2019re all right.\u201d His dark eyes were full of glittering determination.</p><p>He swept her through the living area and back toward her bedroom. He didn\u2019t need to be pointed in the right direction. He, Dane, and Lan knew every square inch of this place because they were always watching over her. They did a sweep of her room every single night before she went to bed. One of them was always somewhere in the shadows, waiting to defend her.</p><p>And now it looked like she needed them more than she\u2019d imagined. Some psycho had gone to a lot of trouble and expense to make her life hell and was probably waiting to do it again. God, that someone must truly hate her. The fact that it could be someone she knew boggled her mind. She tried to think of any obvious enemies she might have, but came up terribly blank.</p><p>\u201cAlea? You went pale again.\u201d He carried her to her bed and settled her on top of the silky, pale-gray comforter. His hand went straight to her forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re hot.\u201d</p><p>She wished he\u2019d said that in a way that meant he found her attractive\u2014and that she could believe. Unfortunately, Cooper Evans was an outrageous flirt. She couldn\u2019t take anything he said seriously. And he\u2019d only meant the words medically.</p><p>\u201cIt was stuffy in the ballroom.\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked behind him. \u201cWhere the hell are they? I need my kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick,\u201d Alea insisted. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to examine me.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to sit up. She really did need to talk to those investigators since she\u2019d only gotten a brief glimpse at the reports, and so much of what they\u2019d said had been strained through the filter of her incredulity. Just thinking about what had happened in the past\u2014what might happen again\u2014her heart ratcheted up to a jackhammer\u2019s pace.</p><p>Oh, god no.</p><p>For the last two years, she\u2019d been plagued by panic attacks, though they\u2019d begun to slow down. She\u2019d thought she was getting better, but now she couldn\u2019t breathe. Damn it, she needed to breathe.</p><p>Alea pushed off the bed and started charging across the room, her blood racing through her veins, her heart roaring in her ears. Blackness swam at the edge of her vision.</p><p>\u201cLea? Baby?\u201d</p><p>The \u201cbaby\u201d nearly did her in. She needed his arms around her, and it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Coop probably called every female under the age of eighty \u201cbaby.\u201d Even if his voice had been so tender that she wanted to cry, she couldn\u2019t take his endearment personally.</p><p>Suddenly, Coop raced around her, gripping her shoulders, holding her secure. He towered over her, his golden brown hair shining under the soft recessed lights. His broad shoulders seemed to go on for days. He looked so masculine, so fiercely capable of protecting the woman he loved. Yet Coop regarded her with such soft concern.</p><p>She wanted to melt against him\u2014and if she did, she\u2019d make a fool of herself. Time to put space between them. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom. Just go away, Cooper. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Alea charged toward her luxurious bathroom, slamming the door behind her. He would leave now. And damn it, no, that wouldn\u2019t disappoint her. Cooper had a job to do, so of course he would retreat outside her bedroom doors, leaving her utterly alone.</p><p>Even knowing that\u2019s what he should do, she leaned against the back of the door, trying to get a lungful of air, and fought tears. Why cry for what she couldn\u2019t change? Angrily, she swiped at the wet paths on her cheeks, then wound her hands to the back of her bodice, pulling at the cinches. In a moment, her breasts broke free and she dragged blessed oxygen into her lungs.</p><p>She pushed the whole gown off and got out of the god-awful spandex undies she\u2019d forced her body into because she didn\u2019t want anyone to know that she wasn\u2019t perfect. God, if they only knew.</p><p>Tears streaked down her face as she turned and caught sight of herself in the mirror. She wasn\u2019t beautiful. She was supposed to be a princess, but somehow she\u2019d ended up with small breasts and an ass that was a bit too wide. Her stomach wasn\u2019t flat.</p><p>They had beaten her for that in the brothel. She could still feel the switch they had used on her, still see the faint scars on her belly. She wasn\u2019t pretty enough to sell. She wasn\u2019t sexy enough to fuck. No one would want her.</p><p>But someone hated her enough to have her kidnapped and tortured.</p><p>Alea crossed to the sink and turned on the cold water. She had to get control of herself quickly because the coronation ball was still in progress. Piper would expect her there. She needed to get dressed again. And she needed to confront her cousins who had involved everyone in the investigation about her abduction except her.</p><p>She\u2019d been so sure when Khalil had died that her ordeal was all over. She\u2019d cried and tried to come to terms with everything. But she\u2019d been safe\u2014or so she had believed. Now she knew it had all been a falsehood.</p><p>And her cousins had perpetrated it.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t face the investigators again wearing that dumbass gown. She\u2019d picked it out for stupid reasons. Piper had told her it was gorgeous, and she\u2019d thought that maybe Dane, Landon, and Cooper would think she was pretty for an evening.</p><p>So stupid. She should have just picked a black dress that covered everything and wouldn\u2019t potentially embarrass the hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cOh god, you\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Alea started, her heart nearly stopping at Cooper\u2019s masculine groan. He was standing in the doorway, staring at her intently, his mouth set in a slightly salacious expression. Slightly? A second glance suggested that maybe she was underestimating him.</p><p>Her first instinct was to leap for a robe, a towel\u2014anything that would cover her\u2014but she just stood there, utterly frozen. He was staring at her naked body, and he wasn\u2019t running away. In fact, he was moving toward her. She retreated a quick step, but her back met the marbled wall, and there was nowhere else to go.</p><p>Alea could hardly catch her breath to speak. \u201cYou should go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so fucking beautiful.\u201d He sounded like he meant it. He edged closer, towering over her.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be in here,\u201d she protested, but it wasn\u2019t the sound of a woman who strongly meant what she was saying. Instead, it sounded breathy, almost like a seduction. What was wrong with her?</p><p>\u201cWhy not, Lea? Give me one good reason.\u201d He braced himself against the wall behind her, his body pressing close.</p><p>She could think of about fifty reasons, but only one came out of her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that\u2019s the best reason I can think of to stay.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her, touching their foreheads together. If he\u2019d been the least bit domineering, she could have pushed him away, but this was a sweet intimacy. How long had it been since she\u2019d touched someone? Felt the heat of another body close to her own quite like this?

I won\u2019t try to touch you again, but you should know that I\u2019ll never stop wanting you. You\u2019re the only woman I\u2019ve been able to think of since I met you.\u201d</p><p>He brought one hand to her shoulder, his fingers just barely touching her, making her shiver in the most delicious way possible.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to come out from under the spell. \u201cYou\u2019ve dated since you\u2019ve been here. Don\u2019t try to fool me.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up, and she found herself staring into the warmest chocolate brown eyes she\u2019d ever seen. His handsome face settled into a frown that did nothing to detract from his male-model gorgeousness. \u201cNot once.\u201d</p><p>She bit her bottom lip. She wanted to believe him. God, she was standing here naked with him and she couldn\u2019t seem to make herself move. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d His fingers made their way down her arm. \u201cI\u2019m worried about touching you. I don\u2019t want to scare you, baby. You have to know I would never, ever want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so different from the laughing, sarcastic man she\u2019d come to know. This was the Cooper she\u2019d always suspected hid under his playful exterior. He was so sweet, but it was hard to believe he wasn\u2019t sexually active. He was the only one of the three of Tal\u2019s guards who regularly took weeks off and left the country. \u201cI thought you had a girl back home. I thought that was why you left every six weeks.\u201d</p><p>He was staring into her eyes, holding her hostage. \u201cI go to a little hospital in Pakistan. I have an old buddy who runs a clinic there. Baby, I\u2019m not seeing someone. I\u2019m vaccinating babies and running the clinic so he has a little time off. I told you. I haven\u2019t wanted anyone since the minute I laid eyes on you.\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cAre you ever going to look at me the way I look at you?\u201d</p><p>Alea wanted to. She studied him all the time when she was sure he wasn\u2019t looking. Tears sprang to her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that I can do any of this, Cooper. I...I don\u2019t think I function the way other women do. I don\u2019t respond to sex.\u201d</p><p>Except she was kind of responding now. Her breathing was ragged. She wasn\u2019t panicked the way she\u2019d been after her rescue. When she\u2019d first come back, she\u2019d pulled away from anyone who tried to touch her. Lately, she\u2019d been wondering if she was missing out. Piper was a hugger. At first it had seemed rude to shove her cousins\u2019 wife away, so she\u2019d endured it, but more and more she found herself initiating the hugs. And she definitely thought about being able to touch her men. In her dreams, she opened to them fully, and they took her in every way. She felt such pleasure, such love... What a far-fetched fantasy.</p><p>And just the fact that she thought of them as her men was proof enough that she\u2019d gone half mad. She should shove Cooper away right this second before he found out how cold she was.</p><p>\u201cBaby, your nipples are hard.\u201d</p><p>He backed up just enough to brush his knuckles over them. Rough, work-callused skin touched her own, lighting a fire deep in her belly. She shivered and gasped, then tried to shrink away. He wrapped an arm loosely around her waist and kept her close.</p><p>\u201cYou respond just fine.\u201d His voice sounded rough. \u201cLet me kiss you.\u201d</p><p>Alea shook her head. \u201cI-I can\u2019t stand too much touch. I can\u2019t close my eyes without...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, baby. You can\u2019t stand being tied down or having someone on top of you. We can work on that. It\u2019ll take time and patience, but I\u2019ve got both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than that.\u201d But he wouldn\u2019t understand, and frustration welled. She needed to grab her robe and run away. She looked around for an escape, but the only way out was through Coop. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I would handle hands really...touching me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me do all the worrying. We\u2019ll work it out.\u201d</p><p>That sounded nice. No, it sounded like a huge relief, letting someone else bear the strain and horror of all she\u2019d endured. God, she was so deeply lonely, but she feared the risk. What if Coop touched her and she panicked? How could she ever look at him or the other two again if she freaked out and made an idiot of herself? They\u2019d know she was frigid. Hell, she\u2019d confessed it. But they didn\u2019t know she woke up screaming and fighting some invisible attacker far too often.</p><p>Slowly, Cooper slid to his knees, somehow making the move deeply graceful. \u201cI won\u2019t touch you with my hands, baby, but I want to show you that there\u2019s not a damn thing wrong with you. You can respond. I can prove it. Let me kiss you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t talking about her mouth.</p><p>Cooper was right there, staring at her. She should be horrified. No one had seen her naked since she\u2019d come home from South America. But there was something heady about the intimacy of being bare and alone with Cooper that she couldn\u2019t deny. She felt frozen, hopeful.</p><p>And then she felt desperate because Cooper didn\u2019t wait for an answer. He leaned in, and she felt the heat of his breath right on her pussy.</p> <p>Alea braced for the panic to set in. She parted her lips to warn him that, any second, she would kick out and try to fight him. She lifted her hands, ready to push him away.</p><p>But everything stopped\u2014time, her heart, her breath\u2014as he kissed her with such aching tenderness, placing little butterfly kisses across the mound of her pussy. Women in her culture waxed their bodies, and now Alea was glad she\u2019d kept up the practice because she could feel every press of his lips against her sensitive skin. Heat flared, but she found herself trembling as she looked down, watching his golden brown hair move as he tilted his head, seemingly determined not to miss tasting an inch of her.</p><p>\u201cYou see, you could handle a little kiss,\u201d he whispered against her thigh, and his words tingled along her flesh. \u201cThe key is to go slow so you know you\u2019re safe. But we can push the boundaries just a little. Do you know how long I\u2019ve wanted to taste you, baby?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been kissed before on the mouth, short, groping attempts at affection when she was younger. Her childhood had been deeply protected. Growing up behind palace walls with three male cousins had ensured she\u2019d gone to college with very little experience, but she\u2019d been kissed a few times. She\u2019d even been touched by two male suitors.</p><p>But nothing had ever been like this, a heady, trembling rush of amazing pleasure. Oh god... And no one had ever gently drawn his tongue across her swelling folds.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop the cry that fell from her mouth. Suddenly she was glad she was leaning against the wall because she was pretty sure her legs nearly dissolved underneath her. She couldn\u2019t quite catch a full breath. His mouth felt so good.</p><p>\u201cYou taste so sweet, Lea. So fucking sweet.\u201d He drew his tongue right up the center of her pussy, stopping at her clitoris to press little circles there.</p><p>Alea could feel herself getting soft and wet, her pussy nearly pulsing with desire. Pleasure drummed behind her clit. And she ached everywhere.</p><p>He sucked half of her labia into his mouth, pulling gently, tonguing her with wicked purpose before returning to her clitoris. She\u2019d read about this feeling, but she\u2019d never thought her parts actually worked. Apparently, she\u2019d been wrong because every nerve in her body now stood at attention, expectant as he laved affection all over her pussy. He licked her clit with the tip of his tongue, and she moaned, melted, dying for more.</p><p>But he seemed intent on making her wait for it, making her crazy. He tapped her clit, then drew it between his teeth, suckling in gentle passes that had her panting for more. A plea sat on the tip of her tongue. Her head fell back against the wall, and her eyes slid shut. Her fingers filtered into his hair.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d she moaned.</p><p>Oh, god, she was soaking wet. He was eating her up, sucking down everything she gave him. And still, he seemed hungry for more. These foreign sensations he gave her made her feel powerful and sexy and right. She started rolling her hips with every brush of his tongue, pushing toward him, forcing him to tongue her harder as she silently begged for more. He could make her come. He could give her everything she\u2019d secretly craved. And she would thank him because she\u2019d never felt more free.</p><p>So close. As he rubbed her clit with his tongue, worrying the perfect spot over and over, she fisted as much of his hair in her hands as she could. Her eyes were going to cross. She held her breath. Soon\u2014in seconds\u2014she was going to scream his name. She was going to find that bliss everyone talked about and shout her pleasure from the heavens.</p><p>Suddenly, he gripped her hips, caging her against the wall and stilling her movements. Her brain blanked and readjusted. Memories catapulted her to a different place. Pleasure vanished.</p><p>No love. No affection. Just chains and pain and heartache.</p><p>Fat bitch. Stay where you are. They were always telling her how ugly she was. How she wasn\u2019t worth the food they gave her. How some day they would just slit her throat and leave her to the dogs.</p><p>She could hear the sound of that hand coming for her. They slapped at her stomach because the skin was thin there. They caned her feet so she couldn\u2019t walk, much less run, for days.</p><p>\u201cLea! Lea, baby, stop!\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t. They would kill her, rape her. They told her she was nothing. A piece of trash. Worthless. And they would annihilate everything inside they hadn\u2019t yet destroyed.</p><p>A stupid princess without her own family. She was cursed and useless, and it would be better if she\u2019d died.</p><p>The worst part was, those words were her own. It was her own voice in her head, in her sleep...when she considered how much easier it would have been if she\u2019d rotted in that jungle.</p><p>\u201cLea!\u201d</p><p>Strong arms caged her, and Alea fought harder. She kicked out, determined to get away. They wouldn\u2019t take her this time. She refused to let that happen. No way was she going back to hell. She would rather die. She heard a long, tortured scream, then realized it was her own. She refused to go quietly. Never. She would make them kill her before she\u2019d go back into a cage.</p><p>\u201cPlease, baby. I won\u2019t touch you again. Please come back to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d A deep voice cut through everything.</p><p>Authority dripped from that voice. Authority decided how she was punished, how and where she would hurt that particular day. Authority meted out \u201cjustice\u201d swiftly.</p><p>\u201cFuck you!\u201d Alea shouted. She was done. They could kill her, but she wouldn\u2019t go meekly. They wouldn\u2019t shove that needle in her arm and make her compliant again. They wouldn\u2019t make her crave the drug that made her kidnappers\u2019 job easy.</p><p>Not again. Not again. Please not again.</p><p>\u201cAlea!\u201d That voice was insistent, pulling at her. \u201cAlea, you\u2019re in Bezakistan. You\u2019re safe. You\u2019re here. No one is going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Strong arms shook her, forcing her to open her eyes.</p><p>Dane? When had Dane come to South America? Had he come for her? He couldn\u2019t see her this weak and pathetic. She tried to push at him, but he was a massive brick wall. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>He refused to budge.</p><p>Tears ran down her face as she thrashed violently for freedom.</p><p>A sharp shock hit her skin, and the fleshy part of her ass flared with a stinging heat, forcing her into the present.</p><p>Then reality hit her harder than any smack to her ass.</p><p>She was in the palace, and she wasn\u2019t alone. She was surrounded by all three of them. Cooper was on his butt on the floor, staring up at her, guilt carved into his face. Lan had a hand on Coop\u2019s shirt as though he\u2019d pulled his friend back. And Dane stood in front of her, his gorgeous face stern and tormented as he stared down at her. His blue eyes were steady as he braced his big hands on her shoulders, seemingly ready to shake her back into reality. He was the one who had slapped at her ass, jarring her long enough to return to the present.</p><p>And suddenly, Alea realized that she was naked in every sense of the word. \u201cGet out of here!\u201d</p><p>None of them moved.</p><p>What had she been thinking? What the hell had she been doing? A sob formed in the back of her throat. She couldn\u2019t handle this. Panic was still there, rolling in the pit of her stomach. Those memories were so close to the surface, she could smell the dank sheets and hear the cries of the women around her. She shoved out at Dane, but he was a tower of pure muscle.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even register her pitiful attempts at freedom. \u201cCalm down, Princess. Do you know where you are?\u201d</p><p>Alea hated his perfectly sensible tone. She was past sanity, and he sounded so completely cool. She tried to calm down, but they were all so close. \u201cI need you to back off. Back off!\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair to lash out at them, but she needed to be alone so she could regroup. She had to get them out of here before she lost it again. She\u2019d humiliated herself enough. And more panic hovered at the edge of her consciousness, stuck in her throat, threatening to escape in a long scream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They had all conspired against her, even Landon. He\u2019d known about the investigation. It was the only explanation for how he\u2019d known where and when that meeting about her life had been taking place. All three of them had been complicit.</p><p>Broken and ugly. That was all she was.</p><p>\u201cAlea, I\u2019m just about ready to put you over my knee and smack that ass until you\u2019re in your right head again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. Well, go ahead. It\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t been through before. You think you\u2019re so big and bad? Go ahead, abuse the stupid, weak princess. Maybe that will make you feel like a man.\u201d She spewed bile his way because she wasn\u2019t about to let him know that she needed them to hold her, to surround her until she was sure no harm could reach her. Eventually, they\u2019d find out she was broken. Then they would leave. She had to erect some really high walls that would protect them all, so their rejection wouldn\u2019t hurt so much. \u201cMen only see women as punching bags anyway, right?\u201d</p> <p>Dane\u2019s face went a bright red, his jaw tightening to the point she was sure it would break. He was so righteously pissed that she thought surely he would beat her and prove who was stronger.</p><p>Instead, he jerked away from her, then pivoted, giving her his back. He didn\u2019t look at her again, merely reached out and grabbed Cooper\u2019s shirt, where Lan\u2019s hand had been previously. He twisted his fist in the garment and started dragging his friend out behind him.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Dane.\u201d Cooper struggled, but nothing seemed to faze Dane. \u201cLet me go. We can\u2019t leave her like this.\u201d</p><p>Dane merely stalked out of the room, hauling his partner along.</p><p>Alea\u2019s hands shook as she felt warm, soft fabric cover her shoulders suddenly. She looked up. Landon. He was settling her robe around her body, covering her nakedness. His face was a careful blank.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that I knew you were all kinds of fucked up, Princess,\u201d Lan began in that down-home Texas drawl of his.</p><p>She laughed, but there was no humor to the sound. She pulled the robe around her like a coat of armor. \u201cGood for you, Lan. You just proved you have eyes and a brain that halfway works.\u201d</p><p>He flinched, and his face closed up. Alea fought tears. What was wrong with her? Why did she keep saying such horrible things? Why was she hurting them?</p><p>Because they terrified her. Because if she hurt them first, they might not be able to hurt her back.</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s a good one, Princess. You know how to go for the throat. You definitely kicked Dane where it hurts the most. Did you know his ex-wife thought that BDSM was abuse? Did you know that even though he never touched her like that, when he asked her to experiment she called him a wife beater?\u201d</p><p>She gasped. How horrible. And how terrible she felt now. Dane would never hurt a woman.</p> <p>Alea closed her eyes for a moment. Sometimes, she didn\u2019t recognize herself anymore. When she lashed out like she just had, the fear and hurt talked, not her. \u201cNo. Oh, Lan, I didn\u2019t know. He wouldn\u2019t have abused her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you have great instincts, Princess. Dane feels like he failed everyone, his whole family, definitely his ex-wife. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the dumbest idiot ever born, so reinforcing that is a surefire way to hurt me. Let me give you some advice on how to hurt Coop because I\u2019m not sure you figured him out yet. He hides his insecurities really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Alea felt hot tears scalding her face.</p><p>Lan thumbed away the tears, but his voice didn\u2019t change. It remained a deep, polite monotone. \u201cCoop came from a big ranching family. When he was a little kid, the ranch hit real hard times. His family almost lost everything. Every dime they made went back into the land or to pay the mortgage, so he grew up poor. He was the youngest of seven boys so by the time the hand-me-downs got to him, they were patched up and worn and he was so skinny that the kids in his school called him Scarecrow. Call him that a couple of times and it\u2019ll cut him to the quick. Since you\u2019re not only fucked up but cruel, that should give you some ammunition. Enjoy it.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe way I see it, either you were always mean or you let them make you mean. Either way, it\u2019s a goddamn shame.\u201d</p><p>Lan brushed away another tear and turned, following after Dane and Coop. They were all leaving, and she\u2019d been the one to shove them away, hurting them and lashing out because she wasn\u2019t brave enough to be kind, welcoming. That required a strong heart, and hers was shattered.</p><p>More tears fell, but the scream that was always in her throat stuck. \u201cLandon.\u201d</p><p>He stopped but didn\u2019t turn. \u201cWhat do you need, Your Highness?\u201d</p><p>So many things. Nothing she could ask for. \u201cTell Dane I\u2019m sorry. And Cooper and... I\u2019m very sorry that I hurt you too.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded and left, and she was alone again.</p><p>Alea crumbled to the floor. The gorgeous gown she\u2019d picked out in hopes that they would notice her was lying on the tile, trampled by boot prints, ruined. What had she been thinking? She could dress up all she liked, but she was still that girl chained to a bed, waiting to die.</p><p>The only trouble now was she seemed determined to take everyone to hell with her.</p><p>Dane let Cooper drop as soon as he\u2019d hauled him out of the princess\u2019s quarters. He didn\u2019t trust Coop not to run back in and try to get on top of her again.</p><p>And he didn\u2019t trust himself not to walk back and have a throw down with her that would very likely end with him getting his ass arrested for laying hands on Her Royal Highness.</p><p>\u201cYou asshole.\u201d Coop was on his feet in a heartbeat. \u201cWhat the fuck was that about?\u201d</p><p>The hallway around them was quiet. He\u2019d been afraid Tal would follow them, but it appeared he had gone back to the ball. He was fine with that because he was just about ready to start throwing punches. Caving in Coop\u2019s face might take the edge off the nasty anger building inside him.</p><p>Alea had scored a direct hit. He could still hear Kelly screaming at him that he was a pervert, a freak for what he needed. He could still remember the day his father had told him what an embarrassment he was to the family and that he was no longer welcome in the house he\u2019d grown up in.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been invited to his brother\u2019s wedding. Of course, that wasn\u2019t such a huge surprise since his very vanilla brother had been marrying his ex-wife.</p><p>He felt Coop shove at his arm, goading him. \u201cWhat? Now you can\u2019t talk?\u201d</p><p>Dane narrowed his eyes, flexed his hands. He\u2019d thought he was going to beat the shit out of Lan for bringing Alea to the meeting, but Cooper had done something much worse. \u201cI can talk, man. I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like what I have to say.\u201d</p><p>Cooper pulled back slightly, frowning. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it was an accident then? You tripped and fell on top of her pussy? Did your tongue fall out and land on her clit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was responding, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Dane had seen just how she\u2019d responded. \u201cYeah, you must have done a hell of a job with her, buddy. She was screaming and kicking and fighting you as if she was struggling for her very survival.</p><p>He\u2019d heard her from down the hall. He\u2019d been lighting into Lan when they both heard Alea\u2019s shout. They\u2019d run, terrified that someone was trying to kill her. Lan had his gun out and he\u2019d just about taken off Coop\u2019s head when Dane realized who it was.</p><p>Coop\u2019s whole body sagged. \u201cIt didn\u2019t start out like that. I was trying to check up on her. I wanted to make sure her BP was okay. She nearly fainted. When she took a while in the bathroom, I went in to make sure she hadn\u2019t fallen or stumbled and hit her head. And I saw her. She was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d Yeah, he\u2019d gotten that, too. He\u2019d seen every inch of her golden body, every curve and valley. Even though she\u2019d been screaming, he was just enough of a bastard to get a hard-on because she was so fucking sexy. Shame filled him. She didn\u2019t want him and she was probably right. No man with real morals would have gotten an erection when the woman he adored was terrified.</p><p>And they damn straight wouldn\u2019t have threatened to spank her. The trouble was, she responded to dominance. It was only when he\u2019d used his Dom voice that she\u2019d calmed and come out of her episode. She needed someone to take control when she couldn\u2019t, to make sure she didn\u2019t hurt herself. To stand by her and give her the safe boundaries and structure she needed.</p><p>\u201cYes, she was so beautiful, and we had this connection, Dane,\u201d Coop continued. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s frigid, but she\u2019s not. She was pressing her pussy against my mouth and wriggling around. That\u2019s why I tried to hold her down, so I could finish her off. Damn, I don\u2019t think that girl\u2019s ever had an orgasm. If I hadn\u2019t wrapped my arms around her, we would be in a totally different place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you would be fucking her, and Dane would be rearranging my face,\u201d a laconic voice said from the doorway. Landon stared at Cooper.</p><p>Coop rolled his eyes. \u201cGod, don\u2019t give me that. I wasn\u2019t trying to steal her. I was trying to show her how good it can be. And you\u2019re a fine one to talk. What the fuck was that move you pulled? Did you sell her on how awful Dane and I are to cut her out of that meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Coop.\u201d Lan squared off, facing the other man down. They started to circle each other like two pit bulls waiting to take a chunk out. \u201cShe deserved to be in that meeting. It was about her. She\u2019s not a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sure knows how to throw a temper tantrum,\u201d Dane said, frowning. \u201cThat shit she just pulled is exactly why I left her out. Alea isn\u2019t ready for that much reality. We all agreed on this plan, and you took it into your own hands to reverse our decision.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been trying so hard to get them all on the same page. Alea needed all three of them. She\u2019d grown up in a country where she was practically expected to marry two or three men, maybe more. Being kidnapped had torn her world apart, but eventually she would find comfort in her custom of plural marriage. But in order to offer her what she needed, they had to stick together, and his asshole, idiot partners were being selfish pricks.</p><p>Lan\u2019s face flushed an angry red. \u201cLook, I talked to Cole. He\u2019s been in this place before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cole Lennox is now your best friend?\u201d Coop shot at Lan, rounding on him. \u201cOr is he the guy giving you advice on how to get her all to yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? He shares his wife with his brother.\u201d Lan growled a little, a sure sign that this situation was about to get ugly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a fine fucking one to talk, Coop. I made a decision to bring her into something that involved us all. I thought we\u2019d sit down and hash this out with her. I thought that maybe if she understood the situation, she would be a little easier on us. Let us closer. What\u2019s your excuse? Are you going to try to convince me that you were just warming her up so Dane and I could come in behind you and show her a good time? I didn\u2019t see you leaving a whole lot of room in her pussy for us.\u201d</p><p>Coop\u2019s right fist flew out, catching Lan\u2019s jaw. There was a thud, and a nasty, happy little smile crept across Lan\u2019s face because he was a man who appreciated violence, and Coop had just made the enormous mistake of giving it to him.</p><p>Lan\u2019s fist popped up almost faster than Dane could see it, and a nice splash of blood came from Coop\u2019s face. His lip, it looked like. He\u2019d shifted just enough that Lan hadn\u2019t broken his nose.</p><p>They started to wail on each other, but Dane had lost the desire to fight.</p><p>Because he was pretty sure they had just lost Alea. Or maybe she\u2019d already been lost, and tonight had simply forced him to face facts. The woman spitting the cruel barbs just wasn\u2019t his princess.</p><p>He heaved a long sigh. She needed him, but she would never acknowledge it, never give him the chance to prove it to her. And, hell, maybe he was wrong. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time. Maybe he should just join a fucking club and spend his time with the subs there who came out for a good time. He\u2019d wrecked his marriage. He\u2019d fucked up his career.</p><p>\u201cI should have expected this.\u201d Tal stood beside him, watching the fight and shaking his head.</p><p>Dane turned, and it looked like Tal had brought out the whole fucking gang. Rafe and Kade were with him, along with the three James brothers\u2014Gavin, Slade, and Dex\u2014as well as the Lennox twins, Cole and Burke.</p><p>\u201cBrothers shouldn\u2019t fight like that, man,\u201d Dex said, shaking his head.</p><p>Gavin James sent his youngest brother a scorching look. \u201cReally? My nose is crooked because of you two fuckers.\u201d</p><p>Slade shook his head. \u201cThat was all on you, brother. Ouch, that\u2019s going to hurt. They\u2019re not big believers in rules, are they?\u201d</p><p>Dane winced because Coop had just landed a kidney shot. \u201cHe was my team\u2019s medic. I don\u2019t think he takes the Hippocratic Oath very seriously. And we\u2019re not really brothers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re making your mistake,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cIf you want Alea, you better behave like brothers. Blood or no, be a cohesive unit. You have to take care of each other and work together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve got to do that if you\u2019re going to survive your wife. Trust me, Cole\u2019s the dumbass. He\u2019s always hiding behind me when he says something stupid.\u201d The Lennox twin on the right pointed to his other half.</p><p>Yeah, Dane would like a word with Cole. \u201cHe might want to hide behind you now.\u201d</p><p>A single eyebrow arched on Cole\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re pissed that I talked to Landon? Well, someone had to. You guys are fucking this up and hard.\u201d</p> <p>The urge to kill flared up again. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>Tal held up a hand. \u201cBefore you kill Mr. Lennox, perhaps you should understand a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike he could kill me.\u201d Cole rolled his eyes.</p><p>Burke shrugged. \u201cDude, we\u2019ve spent the last year hauling our son around, not training for battle. He would probably take you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I could take him down with Caleb strapped into his baby Snugli across my chest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that you just used the word Snugli proves how out of the game we are.\u201d</p><p>The Lennox brothers continued to argue, but Dane looked to Tal. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean what you\u2019ve tried hasn\u2019t worked. You\u2019ve all come at her in different ways, and she is going to require a coordinated assault where you leave her absolutely no way out. It\u2019s imperative the three of you work together. And be smart for a fucking change. I believe she\u2019ll respond to how gentle Landon can be, to Cooper\u2019s playfulness, and I absolutely believe she needs you most of all.\u201d Tal looked pointedly at Dane. \u201cBut you\u2019re the one who\u2019s holding back the most.\u201d</p><p>Tal could accuse him of a lot of things, but not that he\u2019d been holding back. Something crashed in the background, and Dane looked over his shoulder. Landon had Cooper pinned to the ground, getting ready to bash his head in with what was probably a priceless vase. Idiots.</p><p>Cooper kicked up and Lan groaned as his balls met with a steel-toed boot. Every man in the hallway moaned, and Lan started a long fall to the floor.</p><p>Yeah, this was fucking helping.</p> <p>Dane moved in to avoid utter catastrophe. The last thing he needed was to get billed for damaging historical art or some shit. He caught the vase just before Lan hit the floor.</p><p>Cooper and Landon were both on the carpet, chests heaving and blood dripping. They had done numbers on one another.</p><p>\u201cYou two, stay the fuck down or I will get involved in this,\u201d Dane promised. Maybe Rafe was right and they should start considering themselves brothers. If they did that, Coop and Lan better understand that Dane was the big brother, and they were going to have to fall in line.</p><p>For now, they seemed content to lie there and focus on breathing.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He handed the vase back to Tal. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to them.\u201d</p><p>Tal nodded. \u201cThat was a start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell can you say I haven\u2019t been trying with her? I\u2019ve been on walks with her almost every day. I try talking to her, coaxing her out of her shell. I\u2019ve brought her treats, complimented her... Everything I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything a vanilla man should. Alea requires more, and you know it.\u201d</p> <p>Fuck. \u201cShe\u2019s fragile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s also submissive without a firm Dominant. She\u2019s in free fall without a safety net. Rafe, Kade, and I have stood back, hoping you three would get your act together, but...\u201d Tal shook his head.</p><p>Damn and hell. Tal wasn\u2019t telling him anything about Alea he hadn\u2019t already known. Every instinct in his body told him to top her, but she just kept shoving back. He didn\u2019t want to push her too hard. He\u2019d been down that road with Kelly, and it had only ended in divorce.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t force her to see what she needs,\u201d Dane argued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched you with Alea,\u201d Kade said, stepping up. \u201cYou\u2019re at your best when you tell it like it is. But you\u2019ve been very careful with her. Hell, we all have. My brothers and I have resolved to stop now. You have to do the same. I\u2019m not telling you to force her to your will, but you should be open and honest about everything you can do for her. What the three of you give her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve tried so many things,\u201d Rafe added. \u201cWe\u2019ve brought in therapists, given her charity work to take her mind off things, surrounded her with family and friends from her past who can help her remember happier times. None of it has worked. She pretends to be content, but she doesn\u2019t connect with people anymore.\u201d</p><p>Coop pushed himself off the floor. \u201cShe\u2019s got a terrible self-image. She thinks she\u2019s ugly and frigid. We can\u2019t work on that from a distance.\u201d</p><p>Lan got to his feet as well, wiping blood from his mouth. \u201cI hate to admit it, but I agree with Cooper. What we\u2019ve been doing so far hasn\u2019t worked. We\u2019ve been treating her like she\u2019s too fragile. We\u2019ve almost convinced her that she is, too. But she won\u2019t break. She just needs to know that we\u2019re strong enough to handle her.\u201d</p><p>Dane looked at his two best friends. They had beaten each other stupid, but now they were standing together. Maybe that\u2019s what real brothers were like. And maybe it was time to start following his instincts. Alea was floundering. Her world had been broken in a way that she couldn\u2019t put back together all alone. She didn\u2019t know how to ask for help and was afraid to need it. She was damn straight terrified to open her heart.</p><p>He\u2019d worked plenty of operations where he couldn\u2019t just walk through the door, guns blazing. The key was strategy. Find a sneaky way in. He could manage that. A two-pronged approach would work. He could start doing exactly what Tal had suggested, tell Alea everything she was missing, everything they could give her in the filthiest language possible. He wouldn\u2019t hold back. He wouldn\u2019t be polite. And he wouldn\u2019t let her get away with anything.</p><p>And then, when she couldn\u2019t stand another second, they would deliver on their promises. They would show her just how beautiful they thought she was, how hot they could make her, how high they could send her soaring. Once her body belonged to him and his brothers, her heart wouldn\u2019t be far behind.</p><p>\u201cGo get cleaned up,\u201d Dane said to Landon and Cooper. \u201cWe have a lot to talk about. Tal, please have the investigators send me the report. We\u2019ll will regroup in the morning and figure out exactly where to go from here. In the meantime, were going to figure out new protocols for the princess.\u201d</p><p>Tal held out his hand, shaking Dane\u2019s firmly. \u201cThe backup security team can handle the rest of the evening. It\u2019s winding down anyway. Consider your team reassigned. You\u2019re completely in charge of Alea\u2019s security from now on. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>Tal and his brothers, along with their friends, filed down the stairs, heading back to the ballroom, leaving Dane alone with the two men who had watched his back for the last two years. There wasn\u2019t anyone else he would rather go into battle with.</p><p>This was the mission of a lifetime, and Dane didn\u2019t intend to fail.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Alea nearly cursed when she heard the soft knock on her door. The last thing she wanted was more conflict. At least she was dressed this time, having donned silk pajamas after a punishingly hot shower. \u201cPlease, Dane, can we talk about it in the morning? I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>Dane would be the one they sent. He always delivered bad news or a lengthy lecture on how stupidly she was behaving. She knew putting him off wasn\u2019t right, but she couldn\u2019t handle another confrontation tonight.</p><p>The door opened, and a pretty brunette in a designer gown floated in. Piper al Mussad stood halfway in the room, her hands raised in a silent gesture that pleaded for peace. \u201cIt\u2019s just me. Don\u2019t blame me because my husbands are nitwits.\u201d</p><p>Alea couldn\u2019t help but smile. Despite the terror, uncertainty, and shame of the last hour, Piper was a breath of fresh air. Her cousin-in-law was one of those people who lit up the room simply by walking into it. \u201cYou really should have had their IQs checked before you decided to marry them.\u201d</p><p>Piper shrugged. \u201cGive a girl a break. I was blinded by their hotness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, as a girl who remembers them during their prepubescent years\u2014ewww.\u201d But Alea smiled. Piper had been so good for her cousins. She\u2019d become the sun they all orbited around. It reminded Alea of the joy her aunt and uncles had once shared and how happy the palace had been during her youth.</p><p>Piper closed the door behind her, her radiant face suddenly serious. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Alea was so far from all right that it was ridiculous, but she didn\u2019t need to drag Piper any farther into this mess. And she wasn\u2019t about to cause problems in Piper\u2019s marriage. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine. My cousins have always been protective. I\u2019m positive they would\u2019ve told me in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking this way better than I would have. I have to confess, when Talib admitted what had happened, I thought about shoving something up his backside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiper!\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s his favorite form of discipline. We should see how he likes it.\u201d</p><p>Alea felt her face flush. She shook her head as she sat on the couch in the living area of her apartment. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how you can talk about things like that.\u201d</p><p>Piper eased down beside her. \u201cBecause it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. Tell me something. Was your aunt very proper? I know when she was the shaykhah she was every inch a lady in public, but was she reserved in private? I\u2019ve only known her in private and she\u2019s so open. I\u2019m wondering how she dealt with the public side of this life.\u201d</p><p>Alea laughed. Her aunt had been the same whether cameras were on her or not. \u201cShe used to tell us that she wouldn\u2019t hide how much she loved my uncles. She\u2019s very British, my aunt, but that stiff upper lip completely softened around her husbands and children. She is a lovely woman. She was the perfect queen in her day. You actually remind me a lot of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Piper smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough stories about when their fathers were alive to know that my husbands weren\u2019t raised in a household that lacked warmth. When they were children, their parents often displayed their affection and told my husbands that they were loved. So were you. She still loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy aunt and uncles created a wonderful environment to grow up in, though I missed not really knowing my own parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I offend you when I talk about my intimate life with Tal, Rafe, and Kade? It\u2019s not my intention. You\u2019re my closest friend here. I\u2019m afraid I like to talk about everything. It helps me process all that\u2019s happened. The last few months have been full of change for me.\u201d She laid a hand over her still-flat stomach.</p><p>\u201cOh, god, Piper, you don\u2019t offend me at all. I just can\u2019t understand.\u201d And Piper was such a sneaky woman. Now Alea understood why she\u2019d been asking about the family. Piper had been backing her into a corner, and it was easier to simply answer the question she knew would eventually come. \u201cYes, I grew up in an open household, and yet I\u2019m very reserved about sex. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because of what happened to me in South America. I\u2019ve been to several of the world\u2019s best therapists. I know what my problems are.\u201d</p><p>Shrewd eyes stared back at her. \u201cBut you don\u2019t seem interested in fixing them.\u201d</p><p>Alea stood up every time she talked about it, she got restless, uneasy in her own skin. \u201cI don\u2019t like who I am right now. It\u2019s weird because I can remember the girl I used to be, the one who didn\u2019t blow up at everyone, the one who wasn\u2019t isolated. But it feels like all of that was a dream and I had to wake up. Believe me, if I could forget what happened, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never forget, Alea. Forgetting shouldn\u2019t be your goal. But it\u2019s up to you whether or not you allow them to win. Though I admit, watching you continually give in to your captors is painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting anyone win, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Piper sent her a skeptical stare. \u201cTell me you don\u2019t want those men who guard you, Lea.\u201d</p><p>Everything always came back to Dane, Cooper, and Landon. Since the moment she\u2019d seen them, it seemed as if her thoughts had started to revolve around them, if not her world. If she\u2019d been the same exuberant girl who\u2019d left for New York, she would have had all the confidence in the world to try a relationship with them. But this was now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>Piper sighed. \u201cYou can lie to yourself, but I know the truth. I think they know it, too.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled, unbidden, unwanted because she wasn\u2019t that girl anymore. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t see how she could possibly be pretty enough, sensual enough, or healed enough for them\u2014ever. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Piper leaned forward. \u201cWhat happened? Did you get mad because they tried to keep that meeting secret? I don\u2019t think you should blame them. Tal said it was his call.\u201d</p><p>Because Tal always shouldered the responsibility. \u201cNo. This whole plot reeks of Dane, too. I can see him arguing that they needed to get the whole story before they talked to me. He wouldn\u2019t want to worry me until they had a plan in place. He would have taken all the data and come to me with a detailed \u2018op,\u2019 as he would say.\u201d</p><p>Piper\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cIt sounds like you know Dane pretty well.\u201d</p><p>Alea shrugged. \u201cCooper and Landon would have argued, but Cooper can be swayed. Landon is the one who would fight him. Cooper would hesitate to tell me bad news, but Lan would just shove it all out there because he doesn\u2019t know how to be dishonest.\u201d She sighed. \u201cNot that they were intentionally unkind, but, damn it, Piper. It\u2019s my life on the line. I have a right to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Piper said calmly. \u201cObviously Landon did, too. I heard he nearly got his balls kicked in. But you can be very difficult to talk to about this subject. You were the one who asked Tal to keep huge, deeply relevant portions of what happened to you in Colombia out of the reports. You understand how that hampers the investigation?\u201d</p><p>God, she didn\u2019t want anyone to know. She hadn\u2019t even told the therapists everything. \u201cThey have all the information they need.\u201d</p><p>Piper sat back with a long sigh. \u201cNo, they don\u2019t, but you\u2019re not going to believe or admit that. You did nothing to be ashamed of, Alea. What happened was a crime perpetrated against you. You didn\u2019t cause it, but only you can give yourself permission to heal from it. Only you can let go of the pain and really beat the bastards who hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no winners here, Piper. Just a whole lot of losers.\u201d Alea crossed her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s the bitter girl.\u201d Piper smiled tightly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been almost happy lately. I\u2019ve been wondering if she\u2019d finally left the building, but no. She\u2019s in full force tonight.\u201d</p> <p>Bitter. Yes, that described her. She sat down again. The surroundings were so familiar. She\u2019d been happy here at the palace long ago. Now she just felt stuck.</p><p>Alea let a long moment pass before asking the question that had plagued her for months. \u201cDo you think it would be best if I left the palace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Piper leaned closer. \u201cHow can you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re having a baby. I\u2019m not the nicest person. I don\u2019t mean to lash out, but I can\u2019t seem to help it. I\u2019m wondering if...maybe it might be best if I went away. This should be a happy time for you.\u201d</p><p>Piper sighed and shook her head. \u201cYou see everything in the worst possible light. I\u2019m not pointing out bitter girl to blame you. I\u2019m simply saying that you\u2019ve seemed more relaxed these last couple of months. You\u2019ve even been smiling when you walk the grounds with Dane or sit in the garden with Lan and Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she\u2019d enjoyed all those times, but they were over now. She would likely be assigned new guards. She\u2019d ruined everything. Maybe they\u2019d all just give up on her now, even Tal. He could ask her to leave because she was like a wounded animal and no one knew when she would kick or bray and hurt someone around her.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I rather thought the whole sordid kidnapping mess was over. I found out tonight that it\u2019s not. So forgive me if I can\u2019t quite find my charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s not it. I\u2019d hoped you were healing, but you\u2019ve just gotten more adept at hiding your feelings. Alea, no one wants you to leave. You\u2019re more like a sister to my husbands than a cousin. You\u2019ll be my baby\u2019s aunt, and I want him or her to know you. We love you for the strong woman you are. You say this isn\u2019t a game, but in many ways it is. You didn\u2019t mean to play, but you\u2019re holding the cards now and you have to decide whether or not you want to win or let the bastard behind your kidnapping crush you.\u201d</p><p>Alea shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t win. I wouldn\u2019t even know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou win the minute you decide to become a survivor instead of a victim. The minute you accept that you can\u2019t go back and you elect to move forward. You win when you allow the fact that you\u2019ve survived to strengthen you, to make you a better human being than you were before. When you take all the horrible things that happened to you and make something good out of it\u2014that\u2019s a moment of triumph. And you win the minute you let yourself love those three men.\u201d Piper stood and placed a hand on Alea\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI hope you decide to win, because the rest us of love you and want to feel close to you, like family should. We hate that you\u2019ve isolated yourself. We\u2019re all here for you. You just have to decide to join us in the love and laughter. In the light. This is your home. I hope you start acting like we\u2019re your family, too.\u201d</p><p>Piper brushed a kiss across her cheek, and it took everything inside Alea not to pull away. Piper must have felt or sensed it because she had the saddest look on her face as she turned away.</p><p>And she\u2019d screwed up again. Alea sank to the couch. It seemed like the only thing she was capable of lately. The doors closed behind Piper ,and Alea suddenly felt how very alone she was. Piper\u2019s words rustled around in her brain.</p><p>\u201cLea?\u201d a soft voice called out.</p><p>She should lock her doors.</p> <p>Alea sighed. \u201cYes, Yas?\u201d</p><p>Yasmin walked in, still in her perfectly tailored gown. \u201cI heard there was trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to bring her cousin in on all the problems of the evening. She really just wanted to shut out the world and go to bed.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d She spoke with an upper crust British accent, no hint of her Bezakistani roots at all. Yas had worked for years to fit into the English ideal of perfection. She\u2019d bleached her hair a platinum blonde and maintained a slender figure. She wore the right clothes and the right makeup. She was everything Alea wasn\u2019t. Somehow picking out the perfect outfit for the season didn\u2019t matter so much anymore.</p><p>Find the good. That\u2019s what Piper had recommended. There was no good. She was wrong.</p><p>\u201cLea? Are you still with me?\u201d</p><p>Alea shook her head. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m really tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about what Tal and those horrible guards of yours did. Is it true that he gave them complete control over your security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Yas leaned in, sympathy softening her face. \u201cTal released those brutes from his service tonight and dedicated them to your protection full time.\u201d</p><p>It was the absolute worst outcome. Dane, Cooper, and Landon would be on her case twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. And now they had no reason to be nice about it. They would watch and hover, silent and unsmiling, a constant reminder of how awful she\u2019d been. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOliver overheard them. You know he\u2019s always been dreadfully concerned about your welfare. It\u2019s very difficult for me to forget that he was interested in you before he was interested in me.\u201d</p><p>And this was why she didn\u2019t spend much time with Yas anymore. Her cousin was never content to merely talk. She had to find a way to turn the conversation to herself, usually about how terribly she was being treated. It wasn\u2019t that Yasmin was a bad person. She\u2019d simply always felt like a lesser relation because her parents hadn\u2019t lived in the palace. \u201cWe\u2019re just friends, Yas. He married you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Her eyes turned down. \u201cI just always wonder if he regrets not marrying the real princess.\u201d</p><p>Not that again. \u201cYas, I only have the title because our uncles legally adopted me, and they only did that to protect me. They were still my aunt and uncles. That\u2019s what I called them, not mom and dad. They made certain I didn\u2019t forget my real parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you\u2019re referred to as a princess and you have the trust fund to go with it. Most men would be interested in marrying into that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s Bezakistan. Even as a \u2018princess\u2019 who isn\u2019t in line to ascend, if I marry, I\u2019ll be expected to take at least three husbands. Our country is modern compared to some of its neighbors, but it\u2019s still steeped in tradition. Be grateful you got a choice to marry exactly who you want and love.\u201d</p><p>Three husbands. Big and broad men who could protect her and care for her if she would only let them. Dane, Coop, and Landon\u2019s faces swam through her thoughts.</p><p>Yasmin frowned, turning away slightly. \u201cYou might be surprised. Sometimes I think Oliver and his brothers would have been happier with the Bezakistani way of life. But that is neither here nor there. I didn\u2019t come here to talk about my problems. I came to help solve one of yours.\u201d</p><p>Alea wasn\u2019t sure how any of her problems could be solved, but Piper\u2019s advice was still fresh in her mind. If she was ever going to have a life, she had to at least try not to shut her loved ones out. \u201cWhich problem are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a vacation. I can\u2019t imagine how stressful it is for you here.\u201d</p><p>It would be just as stressful in London, and now, thanks to Tal, a big chunk of the problems she was trying to escape\u2014three big ones\u2014would be on her heels. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to go to London right now, Yasmin. I appreciate the offer, but I don\u2019t think I would make great company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOliver and I were talking. He\u2019s always the voice of reason. I think you\u2019re right. The last thing you need is to be surrounded by people. But what if you could get away on your own, all alone for a while? Oliver and I were supposed to leave tomorrow morning in our plane for Sydney.\u201d Yas shrugged. \u201cA little alone time before the baby comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds lovely.\u201d But she wasn\u2019t sure what it had to do with her. She didn\u2019t want to intrude on their babymoon.</p><p>A weary look crossed Yasmin\u2019s face. \u201cBut the thought of getting on another plane makes me sick. I\u2019d already decided to tell Oliver that I would rather stay here at the palace for a few weeks when he suggested a change of plans. Everything is ready to go at the apartment in Sydney. It\u2019s private. It\u2019s well protected. And no one would know who or where you are. Oliver\u2019s brother already hired security for us. They can just protect you instead.\u201d</p><p>No one would know? Not Tal? Not Dane or any of the others? If she could pull that off, she would be totally alone, without anyone\u2019s expectations weighing her down. Despite what the press suggested, she wasn\u2019t a prisoner at the palace. For just for a few days, she could pretend she was normal and maybe she could sort out her thoughts, find a little peace. With that much tranquility, maybe she could figure out what to do next. It sounded heavenly, but... \u201cI don\u2019t know. Tal would be furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s only for a short while. Oliver and I won\u2019t say anything. So Tal won\u2019t have any idea where you\u2019ve gone. If anyone asks about the plane, I\u2019ll simply tell them that we sent it along with notes and supplies for the Reaching Across Cultures\u2019 Sydney office. We\u2019d planned a vacation, but I was hoping to squeeze in just a little bit of work. I really do need to send some things there, so it\u2019s not a total lie. You wouldn\u2019t mind dropping them off, would you?\u201d</p><p>If it meant she got to escape all the censure and pressure here, if she truly got to be alone to sift through the rubble of her life, she wouldn\u2019t mind. \u201cJust leave me instructions, and I\u2019ll take whatever you need. Oh, Yas, do you really think it could work?\u201d</p><p>A bright smile curved up her cousin\u2019s lips. \u201cOliver is very smart. Trust my husband. He always tries to do the right thing for his family.\u201d</p><p>Alea nodded, and they started to make plans. By this time tomorrow, she would be far, far away.</p><p>Landon couldn\u2019t sleep. The events of the evening kept playing out in his head over and over again. He shouldn\u2019t have risen to Alea\u2019s bait and been so hard on her. His first instinct had been to reach out to her, to hold her and try to coddle her back to reality.</p><p>But he\u2019d been doing a version of that for over a year and it simply didn\u2019t work. She was farther from them than ever before.</p><p>He stepped out of the quarters he shared with the full-time guards. Tal had offered all three of them rooms in the palace, but Lan had turned him down. He wouldn\u2019t know what to do with the space. Dane and Coop had made their apartments look something like homes, but Lan felt more comfortable out here with the help. He looked up at the palace, and his stare inevitably drifted to her room.</p><p>What was it about this one female that made him so fucking crazy? He\u2019d seen more beautiful women before, but none of them moved him the way Alea did. It wasn\u2019t just her tragic past. He wasn\u2019t chasing her for the challenge. It was like...his heart recognized her. God, that sounded dumb and girly. Maybe he was a masochist who only craved what he couldn\u2019t have. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The trouble was, he\u2019d seen the soft woman under all that armor. He caught glimpses of her when she was working with children or visiting the hospital. He loved to go on those duties with her because somehow she managed to shove aside her own pain to help others. And that\u2019s when he saw her most genuine smiles.</p><p>\u201cLan? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>Landon sighed and touched his right side. Cooper had done a number on his kidney. He would be lucky if he wasn\u2019t pissing blood for a week. \u201cYeah, Coop, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Cooper rounded the corner, and Landon noticed he was carrying his medical kit. \u201cHey, I was just coming to see you. I thought I should probably check you out since I was the one who damaged you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou barely managed to hit me.\u201d Lan rolled his eyes.</p><p>Cooper laughed a little. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll feel better if I check you out. Amuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Lan looked up at the palace one last time before turning and leading Coop back into the barracks.</p><p>Cooper looked around at the large, mostly antiseptic building. There were twenty small rooms, each with a single bed, closet space, and a desk unit. Cooper followed Landon into the room that belonged to him. \u201cYou know you left the Army, right?\u201d</p><p>Lan was deeply aware of the fact that his room had no personal elements. Cooper had pictures of his brothers and his parents on his walls. Dane had decorated his apartment with paintings and books and other things he picked up in his travels. Lan had only had his grandmother, and she\u2019d never let him forget that his mother had dropped him on her doorstep on her way out to her next party and never come back. There were no pictures of his childhood, no family photos with smiling faces. \u201cI like to keep things simple.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou keep things spartan.\u201d Cooper set his kit on the bed and opened it with a flick of his wrist. \u201cAre all your parts still working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Strangely enough, I haven\u2019t had a chance to use my balls since you decided to shove them halfway up my ass.\u201d</p><p>Cooper chuckled. \u201cWell, you were trying to kill me at the time. How about we just call it even?\u201d</p><p>That was fine by him. \u201cI guess we all made mistakes tonight.\u201d</p><p>A calculated expression crossed Cooper\u2019s face. \u201cOr we all did the right thing, and we were just wrong because we didn\u2019t do it together. I think I was onto something tonight. She was interested. Maybe not in me in particular, but she was curious about sex. She needs to experiment. We need to set ourselves up in some intimate situations with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Like walking in on her while she\u2019s buck naked?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, I didn\u2019t plan that. I really was trying to check on her.\u201d</p><p>Lan shrugged. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just jealous. So she really did respond? I was a little surprised she let you see her naked. Did she fight you?\u201d</p><p>Coop shook his head as he pulled out a couple of bottles and some washcloths. \u201cNot really. She gave me a weak \u2018go away\u2019 before things got really heated. I know what a woman looks like when she\u2019s aroused. She wasn\u2019t afraid. She was inquisitive and hot. And she enjoyed having her pussy loved on.\u201d</p><p>God, he really was jealous of Cooper now. \u201cSo she responded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was moaning and shoving her cunt at me. She wasn\u2019t scared, not until I wrapped my arms around her. That\u2019s when she screamed. I wasn\u2019t hurting her, Lan. I was trying to get closer.\u201d</p><p>Damn it. He hated being a reasonable man. He slapped at Coop\u2019s arm, a brotherly show of affection. \u201cYou probably didn\u2019t do anything I wouldn\u2019t have in your situation. If I had the chance to get my mouth on her, I would. It just makes me worry that she\u2019s never going to be ready for what we want to give her. And if she can\u2019t handle one man, what about three? If you holding her was too much, how the hell will she ever handle Dane?\u201d</p><p>A part of the submission Dane needed fell squarely into the bondage category. Lan had watched Dane with more than one submissive. He took their needs very seriously, but those women had always needed what Dane had to offer. Alea would be terrified.</p><p>\u201cI think the key is to experiment,\u201d Coop went on. \u201cWe need to retrain her. Her captors did a number on her. But she can never have a normal life if she can\u2019t accept love and affection, or enjoy sex. Are you willing to let her live that way just because you\u2019re squeamish?\u201d</p> <p>Put like that, it seemed like a cowardly thing to do. \u201cI get what you\u2019re saying, man. I just don\u2019t know that she wants me.\u201d</p><p>Cooper groaned, his eyes rolling. \u201cYou have got to get over the insecurity thing. She wants all of us. She wants the whole m\u00e9nage thing, or at least she did when she was a kid. I was doing a sweep of the palace the other day and I wound up in the library. Did you know Talib still keeps everything the way his fathers left it? Including the pictures taped to the wall. One of them is Alea\u2019s. I would bet she was about eight or nine when she drew it. It\u2019s of a woman with dark hair and three men. And the title of the picture is \u2018my three husbands.\u2019 I think we could be those men for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d Lan didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>Cooper was right. If they loved Alea, they had to be willing to risk everything to make sure she could enjoy life again, even whatever shot they had at a relationship with her. \u201cSo how do we get ourselves into...what did you call it? Intimate situations?\u201d</p><p>It would be damn near impossible here. The palace was filled to the brim with people and would be for weeks to come because of the coronation. Between family, friends, and visiting dignitaries, Lan wasn\u2019t sure when they would get more than two moments alone with her.</p><p>There was a short knock on the door, then it opened. Dane\u2019s large frame filled the doorway. \u201cHey, I came to check on Lan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, guys, my balls still work.\u201d He hadn\u2019t gotten hit that hard. Not that he\u2019d admit, anyway.</p><p>The corners of Dane\u2019s mouth curled up wryly. It was good to see him smile for once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad because, unfortunately, your balls are important to my plan. But once we put the plan in motion, we all need to watch our balls, guys.\u201d</p><p>Thank god he was joking. After what happened earlier, Lan had been worried Dane would turn into a morose asshole, and there was only room for one of those on the team. He\u2019d taken that place a long time ago and he wasn\u2019t giving it up. \u201cDoes this mean I\u2019m not fired?\u201d</p><p>Dane nodded. \u201cYou know I hate paperwork, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Now, when can I use my still fully functional balls on our girl? Because the way I see it, it\u2019s going to be a long while before we can get her alone.\u201d</p><p>Dane held up the folder he\u2019d been carrying. \u201cThat\u2019s where you might be wrong. This is the flight list for tomorrow out of the palace\u2019s private airstrip. I get a daily update and something odd happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Coop said. \u201cHow many more people do we have to vet? Tell Tal to stop with all the coronation celebrations. Slap a tiara on Piper\u2019s head and call her a queen, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Lan didn\u2019t understand the need for all the ceremony, either. Spending a ton of money didn\u2019t make Piper any more official. It just created more work for them. He hated running background checks. He would rather just shoot people. \u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the people coming in who caught my eye. It\u2019s the people leaving, or rather the person leaving. Oliver and Yasmin Thurston-Hughes changed their plans. They\u2019ve decided to stay in Bezakistan for the next few weeks. They were planning on heading for Sydney tomorrow, but now they\u2019re only sending their personal assistant.\u201d</p><p>And that affected them how? \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You guys need to pay more attention to palace gossip. Their assistant is that little brunette who\u2019s been fucking the hell out of Tal\u2019s valet, who told me tonight that he was very happy because she isn\u2019t leaving tomorrow after all. This is a small craft. The weight on the plane is delicate and has to be fairly precise. So when they changed the flight plans, in addition to the flight crew, they listed a single female passenger, weighing approximately one hundred forty pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that chick might weigh ninety pounds when she\u2019s soaking wet.\u201d As far as Lan was concerned, that assistant needed to eat a cheeseburger.</p><p>\u201cYes. She would likely hyperventilate if her scale said that, yet she\u2019s the one who filled out the change-of-flight form,\u201d Dane finished.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch, she\u2019s running,\u201d Cooper cursed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she can run in those heels. Yas\u2019s assistant seems really puny and unhealthy.\u201d Lan was pretty sure she wasn\u2019t a runner.</p><p>Dane laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about Alea, buddy. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s the right weight. They\u2019re trying to pass it off as the other girl. They\u2019re giving her the means to leave on her own and away from all these people, including us.\u201d</p><p>Damn, he should have caught on. That sounded like the kind of play Alea would pull. \u201cI saw that Thurston Hugs-a-Lot fucker listening in on you and Tal. The slimy bastard told Alea that we\u2019re taking over, and she\u2019s running.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a way with words, Lan,\u201d Coop said, then he turned to Dane. \u201cSo what are we going to do? Stop the plane?\u201d</p><p>Lan didn\u2019t think that was a good idea. Alea was going somewhere private. They wanted to be really damn private with her. \u201cI think we should get on that plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ahead of you,\u201d Dane said. \u201cI\u2019ve already revised the flight plan to include the three of us. I met the woman who\u2019s going to be serving on the plane and I talked to her. She\u2019s willing to help us out. We\u2019ll sneak on and be in the air before Alea can do a damn thing about it. Pack up, boys. We\u2019re headed for Australia. We\u2019re going to spend some time all alone with our girl.\u201d</p><p>It could go crazy well. It could be the apocalypse. Either way, he was ready.</p><p>Lan smiled. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Alea cast a cautious glance behind her as she stepped onto the airstairs that would take her up to Oliver\u2019s private Boeing. She half expected to see Dane, Coop, and Landon running across the darkened tarmac to stop her, but the world was quiet now. And she hadn\u2019t seen them at all this morning.</p><p>Of course it was five thirty a.m., and they were likely sleeping. Even knowing that, a little kernel of completely perverse disappointment weighed down her stomach. She took a deep breath and ascended the steps.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Princess,\u201d the flight attendant Oliver had hired said in her crisp British accent, a jaunty blue and yellow scarf tied at her neck that matched her smile and the navy blazer she wore. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have you here. I hope you find everything to your liking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s lovely. Thank you.\u201d Alea handed the young woman her suitcase, then looked around the cozy cabin.</p><p>But what the small, yet well-appointed interior looked like to her was lonely. She was the only passenger. The pilot was in the cockpit, and a door between them was closed. Another door separated her from the rear of the plane, which included the kitchen and the hostess\u2019s quarters. Once again, Alea was separated from everyone else.</p><p>The flight attendant also offered to take her rolling carry-on, but Alea demurred since it held most of her entertainment for the long flight.</p><p>As she made her way deeper into the cabin, she felt vaguely guilty for running off when Tal had hired investigators to dig into her kidnapping. But last night had proven that she was near a breaking point, lashing out at everyone. She felt more than vaguely ashamed by the things she\u2019d said to Dane, Lan, and Coop. So Yas and Oliver\u2019s offer had come at the perfect time. This holiday alone would help her think, clear her head. No one would know where she was, especially the asshole behind her abduction. She didn\u2019t want to worry her family, so she\u2019d text Piper and tell her cousins\u2019 wife to assure everyone that she was perfectly safe.</p><p>Two weeks. She was giving herself fourteen days to decide what she wanted to do next in life. She had the investigators\u2019 report in her bag. She was going to read up on her case and decide on a course of action. Maybe she would just take her trust fund and disappear. Then no one would have to deal with her anymore. But the thought of never seeing her family again, of never seeing her men...</p><p>\u201cPrincess? If you\u2019ll take your seat, we\u2019ll be taxiing in just a moment.\u201d The hostess gestured to one of the eight executive-style seats. \u201cThe pilot has brought you a bottle of wine from his homeland. He is so very proud to be flying for you today.\u201d</p><p>Alea sighed inwardly. She wasn\u2019t much of a drinker, but she would have to try the wine to be polite. It was expected as part of the Bezakistani royal family. Then once she hit Sydney, she could just blend in, be anyone, while she thought things through.</p><p>She picked a seat near the window and glanced out. She could see the palace from here. It looked like home, and something inside told her not to leave. But if she went back, she would be forced to deal with them\u2014and she wasn\u2019t thinking about her cousins. She just couldn\u2019t face her gorgeous guards again so soon after making a complete ass of herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you and I would love to thank the pilot personally.\u201d</p><p>A little jolt told her the aircraft was moving. She would have to thank the pilot later.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019d like that after we\u2019re in flight. I\u2019ll serve the wine with lunch, if that\u2019s to your liking, Your Highness.\u201d At Alea\u2019s nod, she smiled. \u201cI had to scramble, but I think I have enough food for everyone. This is a very long flight. We\u2019ll be in the air for almost fifteen hours. Those men look like they\u2019ll eat a lot, but I\u2019ll ensure you have all you need.\u201d The hostess patted her arm. \u201cI will serve coffee and tea as soon as we\u2019re level. Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask for me if you need anything. Gentlemen, you really must take your seats now.\u201d</p><p>As the flight attendant found her own jump seat in the back, a chill iced Alea\u2019s body. Gentlemen? Large men who needed a lot of food? Oliver better have found a small rugby team to send to Sydney because it couldn\u2019t be who she feared. They couldn\u2019t know about this trip. She\u2019d been careful and kept her mouth completely shut. She\u2019d gotten up at an unholy hour and packed fairly light. No. She closed her eyes and drew in a long breath. She was supposed to be alone. Please let these be a few hangers-on who wouldn\u2019t be anything like...</p> <p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s going to keep her eyes closed the whole trip, Dane?\u201d Cooper asked from the back of the plane.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! She shook her head, praying that she was just having a dream. No, a nightmare.</p><p>\u201cI think eventually she\u2019ll come to the conclusion that this is reality, and she\u2019ll open those gorgeous brown eyes. Then she\u2019ll probably start spewing more bile at us. Or at the very least objecting that we\u2019re crashing her clandestine solo holiday. Either way, she\u2019s going to be pissed off. So just sit back, relax, and wait for it. After the pointless argument is over, we\u2019ll have hours to hash out how everything between us is going to work from now on.\u201d Dane\u2019s voice reeked of self-satisfied authority. And sex. After last night and coming so close to discovering firsthand the whole big deal about consensual sex for pleasure, she really didn\u2019t know how to cope with how hot he sounded.</p><p>Alea gritted her teeth. It didn\u2019t matter. In theory, she was the princess, and they were paid employees. She\u2019d be well served to remind them of that and establish firm boundaries.</p><p>The seats beside, behind, and in front of her all jostled. She opened her eyes, and sure enough, she was surrounded by miles of gorgeous man flesh. Sure, all three of them were wearing clothes, but she could guess what sort of hard muscle was under those T-shirts. Still, that didn\u2019t mean a thing because they weren\u2019t welcome on her vacation.</p> <p>\u201cGet off this plane.\u201d</p><p>Landon\u2019s clear blue eyes widened innocently. \u201cHow\u2014jump? Gosh, Lea. It\u2019s moving. I don\u2019t think now is a good time to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere comes the bile-spewing portion of the day, my brothers,\u201d Dane said with a smirk that really should have crawled under her skin. But his almost obnoxious confidence was somehow sexy. \u201cWatch. She\u2019s going to go through a bunch of steps of the grieving process. She\u2019s already been through denial.\u201d</p><p>Two weeks of this\u2014of them\u2014and she\u2019d be no closer to finding peace than she had been last night.</p><p>\u201cYou have to get off this plane,\u201d Alea said, her voice tight. \u201cPlease. I need time alone to think, so you can\u2019t go with me. After last night, you shouldn\u2019t want to be with me. Just tell Tal I skipped out on you. I promise I\u2019ll come back safely if you\u2019ll just give me some space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s a little bit afraid, Dane,\u201d Cooper suggested.</p> <p>Dane shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s bargaining now. Only because she doesn\u2019t understand yet and doesn\u2019t trust that we mean business. She will soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLea, we\u2019re not going to hurt you,\u201d Lan vowed. \u201cWe\u2019re here to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d Dane smiled smugly. \u201cJust wait, man. This is the pain and fear talking. She\u2019ll calm down soon.\u201d He settled back into his chair like he was enjoying the show and waiting to see the next act.</p><p>Oh, she was so done with him. Dane thought he understood her? That he could read her mind and guess how she was going to react? Bullshit.</p><p>Despite the plane still rolling along the runway, Alea yanked her seat belt off and stood, then grabbed Dane\u2019s hand in hers. She would throw his ass off the plane herself if she had to. She could do it. She\u2019d read about women who got great bursts of strength when they really needed it during a panic. Surely this qualified.</p><p>\u201cHow far out are we, Coop?\u201d Dane asked as she pulled fruitlessly on his arm.</p><p>He glanced out the window. \u201cLooks like there\u2019s another plane ahead of us. I think that\u2019s the prime minister heading home. She\u2019s got three-to-five minutes to try to haul you out of here.\u201d</p><p>If that concerned Coop, he didn\u2019t show it. Instead, he leaned his head against the headrest and closed his eyes like he didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p> <p>\u201cDamn you, get off this plane!\u201d She tugged even harder, putting her weight into the effort. Instead of staring at her like he was bored, this time Dane stood. His massive frame towered over her. He wasn\u2019t smiling.</p><p>\u201cSit down, Alea. We\u2019re going to cut through the rest of this crap and get straight to acceptance. We\u2019re going wherever you\u2019re going. If you would like to stay in Bezakistan, we can do that. As it happens, I think a little time away would be good for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she nearly shouted. \u201cI need time away from everything that distracts and confuses me. That definitely includes you three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it now?\u201d he asked, his voice going dangerously low.</p><p>He didn\u2019t touch her, but she could feel the heat of his body reaching her, wrapping around her. He was so close. Like Cooper had been close the night before. Alea took a long breath, trying to calm herself, but what she got was a nose full of the delicious, masculine scent of soap and something else uniquely Dane.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Alea. Do you really want to be away from us? Because I think you\u2019re lying. I can see your nipples. They\u2019re hard.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, she should have worn a sweater. She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m mad. They\u2019re not aroused nipples. They\u2019re angry nipples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you not to lie, Alea. Those are lonely nipples. Those are aching nipples. Do you want to know what I\u2019ve got planned for them?\u201d His voice had gone husky.</p><p>A hot denial sprung up inside her, settling between her legs, and she wondered if she was fending him off or just baiting the bear. \u201cYou\u2019re my guards. You\u2019re supposed to keep my body safe, not touch me. No, wait. You aren\u2019t my guards. I\u2019m firing you right now. You can\u2019t talk to me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are your guards, according to Tal. He signs our paychecks. And I\u2019m going to talk to you this way a lot from now on. We\u2019re not going to let you dismiss us anymore. There\u2019s something between all of us. Chemistry like this doesn\u2019t happen often, and I\u2019ll be damned if I let you keep shoving that aside just because you\u2019re too scared to see where it leads, Princess.\u201d Dane\u2019s voice sizzled over her skin, an unavoidable reminder of the heat scorching through her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right. I\u2019ve never felt anything like this.\u201d Landon was suddenly behind her, his voice a hot whisper on the nape of her neck. \u201cI can\u2019t just walk away from it. I want to be around you. With you. Inside you. I want you to work with us to make this whole thing good.\u201d</p><p>Alea stifled a moan bubbling in her throat at the feel of them so close. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018thing.\u2019\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d meant for that statement to come out in a firm voice, but it just sounded breathy and sensual. They weren\u2019t touching her, but for the first time, she wanted them to. She\u2019d lost it last night when Coop had grabbed her just before... But what if he hadn\u2019t? What if she\u2019d kept her head? What if they took everything really slowly? Maybe she wasn\u2019t totally broken and her body could actually respond if they told her what they planned to do, prepared her mentally first. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than a little something between us, baby,\u201d Coop said, sitting up now, his previous laziness shoved aside. \u201cIt\u2019s real, and we\u2019ve all been dodging it. I\u2019m done with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d Dane\u2019s words sounded like a vow. \u201cSo now I\u2019m going to tell you exactly what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>The desire shimmering from those blue eyes made something in her belly jump and tighten. If what he had to say was half as hot as his face suggested, she wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. \u201cDon\u2019t. Please. I\u2019ll sit back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, we\u2019re back to bargaining.\u201d Dane\u2019s hair was just the slightest bit shaggy, and she loved the way it curled around his ears as he looked down at her. \u201cI think we have another couple of minutes before takeoff, so I\u2019ll elaborate. First, I want to look at your breasts, Alea. I want you to take your shirt off and show them to me. I want you to cup them with your hands and offer them up.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head even as the heat inside her surged. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll tell you how beautiful they are,\u201d Landon continued. \u201cWe all will. We\u2019ll sit and watch them for a minute because none of us will be able to take our eyes off you and your gorgeous, full breasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t. They\u2019re small.\u201d Why was she talking about herself? She should be shoving them away and firming up boundaries. But no, she was standing there and arguing over the size of her breasts. And practically feeling Dane\u2019s hands on her, even though he wasn\u2019t touching her.</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re the perfect size, baby. They\u2019ll fit right in the palm of my hand. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen breasts as beautiful as yours. Tell me something, Princess. Did Cooper get his mouth on those nipples last night?\u201d</p><p>She shivered, remembering everywhere Cooper had put his mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI barely touched her breasts. I just ate that pussy like it was the tastiest treat I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d Cooper edged closer to her. \u201cYou tasted so good, baby. I\u2019ve had a hard-on ever since, and no amount of masturbation satisfies my cock. I want you.\u201d</p><p>The idea of Cooper touching himself while he thought of her sent another wave of arousal through Alea. She actually wanted to touch him, to see and feel him all over. Their words were turning her into a woman she didn\u2019t know, one who ached to do and feel everything they murmured in her ear. Would they let her explore without asking for anything in return? Likely not. Men seemed geared to take from women. These three had proven they could be polite and kind, but she was sure in the bedroom, Dane, Lan, and Coop would be like other men.</p><p>But...what if, like Coop\u2019s mouth on her, that could actually feel good?</p><p>\u201cI want to suck your nipples, Alea.\u201d Lan\u2019s voice was softer than she could ever remember. \u201cI\u2019ll be so gentle. I\u2019ll lick, play, and kiss on them until you forget there was a time when they weren\u2019t in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a breast obsession,\u201d Dane admitted with a chuckle. \u201cNow, as for me, I really want to touch your ass. God, Alea, do you know what that round ass does to me?\u201d</p><p>She tried to back away, but only bumped into Landon. \u201cNow I know you\u2019re joking. My ass is huge.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Dane tensed. Cooper shot a placating stare to his pal. \u201cNo. Go easy on her, man.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cWe\u2019re going to establish a few rules, baby, some for your protection, some for our sanity. Rule number one, you don\u2019t ever talk badly about yourself.\u201d</p><p>Why did what she thought or said about her ass matter? No clue. In fact, she couldn\u2019t think about anything except the fact that they still loomed so close\u2014and seemed to be moving in. \u201cI am going to talk to Tal. You can\u2019t treat me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby. Who do you think gave us his stamp of approval?\u201d Dane leaned closer until his lips were almost touching hers.</p><p>She tried to move, but Landon wasn\u2019t willing to let her retreat from them. The minute she backed up, something thick and hard poked at her bottom. His erection. That didn\u2019t scare her the way it should. Still she tried to move forward. When she did, another erection poked at her belly. Dane. Her knees went weak.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Princess.\u201d Dane didn\u2019t sound sorry at all. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s my permanent state around you, and I just don\u2019t have the inclination to masturbate like Coop there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you smell so good.\u201d Landon groaned against her neck.</p><p>\u201cAre you sniffing my hair?\u201d She brushed it in front of her shoulders, away from Lan\u2019s nose. What rabbit hole had she fallen down? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all he\u2019s smelling, Princess,\u201d Dane replied. \u201cI know because I smell it, too. If you\u2019re going to tell me your pussy is angry like your nipples, I\u2019m going to call bullshit. You\u2019re aroused. Do you want me to take care of that for you? Cooper didn\u2019t quite make it. I promise you we won\u2019t have that problem this time. I\u2019ll touch that pussy until you find heaven. We\u2019ll go so slow, and you\u2019ll be in charge\u2014for now. We\u2019ll only do this your way and for your pleasure until you can handle more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Lea,\u201d Lan groaned in her ear. He wasn\u2019t pressing his erection into her, but it was big enough that she couldn\u2019t miss it. \u201cLet us taste your pussy. I\u2019ll be so gentle. I\u2019ll just lick and love it until you come all over my mouth. I want that so bad. I want to touch you, but I won\u2019t until you\u2019re comfortable with it. Just my mouth and your sweet pussy. Don\u2019t you want to come? Don\u2019t you want to feel good?\u201d</p><p>Landon\u2019s words were drugging her, pulling her into a place where all she wanted to say to him was yes.</p><p>\u201cSuch a pretty flush on your cheeks,\u201d Cooper murmured. \u201cWe\u2019d persuade you to pull up your skirt. We\u2019d take off your panties and have you sit back in one of those big chairs. We would spread your legs wide and take turns eating at your pussy. I\u2019m dying to get my mouth on you again.\u201d</p> <p>Now that she\u2019d opened herself up to the possibility of pleasure, Alea could see that vision so clearly in her head. And heat pulsed between her legs. Landon and Cooper would jostle for position between her legs. Their tongues would run all over her, and she would find that magical moment other women talked about. And Dane. She would do what he demanded. She would lift her shirt and unhook her bra and let his lips and teeth touch her not-so-angry nipples.</p><p>That all sounded...fantastic. Sexy. Maybe she could do it. Maybe she could have them.</p><p>The plane jolted forward as it started to move again, slinging Alea back against Landon. His big arms came around her, keeping her upright. That was all it took to incite panic. She screamed and tried to shove away from him, thrashing and kicking.</p><p>\u201cAlea, no. You will calm down now.\u201d Dane\u2019s deep voice cut through the sheer terror.</p><p>His command drummed in her head. She was on the plane, and Lan was just trying to steady her. Finally, she dragged in deep breaths and stilled, even managing to brace herself against Landon\u2019s hard chest. He froze as she regained her balance.</p> <p>\u201cI want to hug you, Lea,\u201d he whispered, lightly brushing her arms. \u201cBut I won\u2019t. I just want you to know that if I could do anything in the world right now, I would hug you and try to make you feel safe.\u201d</p><p>Tears sprang to her eyes. His words were a far cry from anything any man in Colombia had said to her. God, how could she turn that away? Lan sounded so vulnerable. He was making himself that way. It couldn\u2019t be easy on him, but he was doing it for her.</p><p>Very slowly, she turned and put her arms around Landon, her body shaking as she did.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wrap her up, didn\u2019t jump on her. He just stroked her hair gently, his voice achingly tender. \u201cThank you, Lea.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and let herself sink into him a bit more. It wasn\u2019t bad. Actually, it was sort of nice. But it proved she was still fucked up because it had taken all her courage and mental focus just to allow herself to hug the man trying to protect her.</p><p>Alea shuddered and pulled away. God, she was so damaged and she wasn\u2019t sure if or how she could be fixed.</p> <p>Dane sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re about to take off, baby. Sit down. I think we\u2019ve reached the depression phase of this mourning.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, they were gaining speed. Soon, they\u2019d be in the air to Australia. With these three along, no telling what that would bring. But she didn\u2019t see a peaceful holiday in her future.</p><p>Alea eased back into her seat and buckled her belt. Her voice was still shaky. \u201cWhat exactly do you think I\u2019m mourning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe days of wallowing, Princess. They\u2019re over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerk.\u201d She turned her chair away from him, but that sent her looking straight at Cooper, who smiled at her and didn\u2019t try to hide his erection.</p><p>She turned toward the window as the plane touched off the runway, and she stared out into the big, dark sky just beginning to lighten with the coming day. It was vast, expansive, right in front of her. But all that open freedom may as well have been a million miles away.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t they understand that this was never going to work? She was never going to be able to handle a man on top of her much less three.</p><p>\u201cI believe our princess has gone into the inner-journey phase,\u201d Dane whispered as though she couldn\u2019t hear him. \u201cBy the time we get to Australia, she\u2019ll be in acceptance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you think I\u2019m accepting that you took it upon yourself to crash my vacation without asking what I wanted, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can thank us for our stellar company later,\u201d Coop teased.</p><p>\u201cGod, I wish I had something to throw at you.\u201d But her lips were turning up.</p><p>And what the hell had happened to Dane? When had he gone from super polite to this ridiculously charming asshole? And why did she like him so much more this way?</p><p>Because he was finally being himself. They all were. Instead of being what they thought she wanted or wearing their professional masks, they had dropped all pretenses to just be themselves. They had been so gentle because they were worried she would break at any moment, but the whole \u201cpoking fun at her\u201d thing meant that she really couldn\u2019t stay angry. And she couldn\u2019t take herself too seriously. It was so much more dangerous because it made her feel almost normal again.</p><p>And she had to remember that she wasn\u2019t. They might be comfortable showing their real selves, but she didn\u2019t have that luxury. The minute they knew the Alea who lived deep inside her, they would run as fast as they could.</p><p>She looked through the tiny window and watched as the world she knew fell away.</p><p>About six hours later, Cooper watched as Alea started to drift off. She\u2019d probably been up half the night packing and plotting her escape, only to discover they had her cornered. Now she was exhausted. There was nothing more he wanted to do than to cuddle close to her and let her sleep on his chest.</p><p>Instead, he cursed under his breath. Besides the fact that she wasn\u2019t ready for any man to hold her close, he sounded like some sort of rom-com loving freak. If he didn\u2019t watch himself, he was going to burst into song, and that would be bad for everyone because he was tone deaf.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s okay?\u201d Lan asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cShe handled being accidently touched today a hell of a lot better than she did last night,\u201d Dane whispered.</p><p>Well, she hadn\u2019t tried to deball any of them, so Cooper was calling it a win. She\u2019d held it together and honed in on Dane\u2019s voice when panic had threatened, so that was progress. And she\u2019d actually managed to put her arms around Landon.</p><p>Funny, that. Coop knew damn well he\u2019d had more of an intimate connection with Alea than the others, but he\u2019d felt a twinge of jealousy when she\u2019d haltingly placed her arms around Lan\u2019s chest and stood there in his arms. The moment had felt deeply tender, and she\u2019d pushed herself to extend the gesture rather than just stand there and accept it because she\u2019d known that Landon needed the contact. Lan\u2019s yearning had compelled her to give him the comforting balm of her hug in return. That compassionate, loving woman\u2014that\u2019s who Alea was deep down, when she let herself be.</p><p>Building a relationship with her that included compromise and trust would not be easy. But with time and open communication, Cooper had hope that they would work it all out. If nothing else, she hadn\u2019t found a way to throw them off the plane, and that had to count for something. She\u2019d responded to Dane\u2019s dominance way better than Coop had expected. When she\u2019d started to lose control, Dane\u2019s commands had snapped her attention right back. And he hadn\u2019t missed the way she\u2019d smiled and turned yielding in the face of Dane\u2019s sexually-laced arrogance.</p><p>Lan was the gentle one. He was the one she\u2019d bend for because she hated to hurt or upset him. Dane was the Dom who could give her the firm foundation she needed.</p><p>Where the hell did he fit in?</p><p>Dane stood up and gestured toward the seats grouped together in the back. He and Lan followed. The cabin of the plane was small but luxurious. Alea was sitting close to the front, so they migrated away to let her sleep.</p><p>They\u2019d all eaten breakfast together. The lovely but bland flight attendant had served croissants and Danishes, along with smooth, rich coffee, but it was the conversation that had really surprised him. He and Dane had started talking about activities they could potentially do in Sydney. Alea had joined in, discussing her favorite places in Australia. Lan had listened with an excited smile. Within minutes, they had all been laughing and teasing, especially after Lan had threatened to find a crocodile to wrestle because he was certain that no Aussie could be tougher than a Texan.</p><p>It felt natural and right to be with these people. In those moments of flowing laughter, they had felt like a family.</p><p>Then Alea suddenly seemed to realize she was this close to being happy. She\u2019d excused herself, turned away, and fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you guys about the investigators\u2019 report.\u201d Dane had a familiar folder in his hand. \u201cI set up a conference call with the guys at Anthony Anders for the day after tomorrow. I refuse to be out of the loop just because we\u2019re on a different continent. And we need to discuss her security protocols.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should never, ever be left alone,\u201d Landon said, frowning.</p><p>Coop didn\u2019t even want to think about it, but he had to. \u201cIf her abduction wasn\u2019t a random act and this is someone who knows Alea, then the question becomes who and why would anyone want to do this to her?\u201d</p><p>This. God, he couldn\u2019t verbalize the idea of someone torturing Alea or selling her into sexual slavery, sending her into a hell most people couldn\u2019t imagine. It made him somewhere between panicked and violent.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t actually been raped, not in the most technical sense of the word. She\u2019d been horrifically abused, and he didn\u2019t know the full extent of what she\u2019d been forced to witness or endure. It made no sense that her virginity had been left intact. That had been a deliberate choice on someone\u2019s part. But why?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine forcing this on anyone,\u201d Lan said, looking through the file. \u201cMuch less someone like Alea. She was just going to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she was working with a charity organization that helped battered women,\u201d Dane murmured. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know that?\u201d</p><p>Cooper wasn\u2019t sure either. From the beginning of the investigation, she\u2019d very likely kept lots of information to herself. \u201cShe sure hadn\u2019t let her cousins in on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she keep something as kind as charity work a secret?\u201d Lan asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t, my cousins would have come in and made a big production of it,\u201d Alea said, startling them all. \u201cI just wanted to do something good. I had some free time, and I like charity work. I\u2019ve done it all my life. If word had reached the palace that I was working at a women\u2019s shelter, someone would have decided to use it as good press.\u201d She was still sitting in her chair, but she\u2019d turned it. She clutched the blanket he\u2019d settled over her close. \u201cI want to talk to you guys about whatever danger is still lurking out there. Don\u2019t leave me out of the conversation when it\u2019s my life. I get that you thought you were protecting me, but I have to know.\u201d</p><p>Dane nodded slowly. \u201cAll right. From now on, I\u2019ll include you. We have a conference call in a few days, baby. I\u2019ll try to be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Will you stop calling me baby?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life, baby,\u201d Dane shot back without a hint of guilt. \u201cNow according to the Anders brothers, you started working at the shelter the same week you moved to Manhattan. Why did you pick a shelter in the Bronx?\u201d</p><p>Alea huffed a little. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the most help was needed. My roommate\u2019s mom was a social worker there. I got very close to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your roommate?\u201d Dane asked.</p><p>Alea laughed, a bitter little sound. \u201cNo. Heather was a righteous bitch. She couldn\u2019t be bothered to help anyone. She was far too busy trying to set herself up as the queen of NYU. She was furious when I wouldn\u2019t put on a tiara and go to parties with her. So self-centered... But her mother was quite lovely. She invited me to come down and visit the shelter when she found out I was interested in social work. I met some of the women, heard their stories. My heart broke for them. I knew I had to go back.\u201d</p><p>That was his Alea. She couldn\u2019t turn away a person in need. Now she could completely reject her own needs, but when she was faced with someone else\u2019s, her natural compassion shined through. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you have any run-ins with anyone there?\u201d Dane asked.</p><p>\u201cWe helped women and their children escape abusive partners, so there were always threats. They kept their address a secret, but even so, the determined jerks found the place and showed up to rant. But no single incident stands out.\u201d</p><p>They should have included her in on the case sooner. Cooper saw that now. Some information only Alea could give.</p><p>Dane stared down at the folder. \u201cYou called the police on the fifteenth of October about a man who threatened to shoot you.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper felt his blood start to boil. \u201cShoot you?\u201d</p><p>Alea shrugged, an animated grin crossing her face. \u201cIt\u2019s the Bronx. I could have gotten shot just walking down the street. I disarmed him and called the police. He was crying and telling me his tale of woe by the time they got there. I don\u2019t think he had me kidnapped. He had no idea who I was or that I was a student at NYU, much less a princess from Bezakistan. How would he have had access to stationary from the embassy? To him, I was a random \u2018bitch\u2019 keeping him from his punching bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there were potentially a whole bunch of men who came to that shelter with a reason to hate you,\u201d Lan argued.</p><p>She shrugged slightly. \u201cI guess that\u2019s one way to look at it. But, guys, I dealt almost exclusively with very poor people. Didn\u2019t I read something about the person behind my abduction paying for my upkeep? Like five grand every ten days? By the way, that was not five grand worth of upkeep. The accommodations sucked ass, as they would have said back in New York.\u201d</p><p>He was actually taking her sarcasm as a positive sign. \u201cShe\u2019s got a point, Dane. I don\u2019t think it was a person she encountered during her charity work. Seriously, if it had been one of those douchebags, he would have either fucked her himself to show Alea that he was all big and bad, or he\u2019d have made sure she was \u2018learning her place.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice way to put it,\u201d Alea said.</p><p>He held his hands up. \u201cBaby, I\u2019m just telling you the way that kind of man would think.\u201d</p><p>Alea\u2019s eyes narrowed on him, and it was all he could do not to shrink back. She had a damn fine evil eye. \u201cNot you, too.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to shrug. He wouldn\u2019t take it back. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re my baby. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Her gorgeous eyes rolled. \u201cI have a name, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to call you darlin\u2019,\u201d Lan offered.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not better,\u201d Alea said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, how about snuggle bear?\u201d Lan returned. \u201cOr puddin\u2019? That\u2019s another real popular choice down South.\u201d</p><p>Alea sighed. \u201cDarlin\u2019 it is, then.\u201d</p><p>Lan just smiled.</p><p>Score one for the guys. It was good to know she could be cornered. Why hadn\u2019t they tried this tactic earlier? Now that they had her alone and were establishing rules, everything seemed so much simpler. It was as if her stress level had plummeted, and she seemed more willing to compromise. Maybe being away from her cousins and the pomp of the palace would be a good thing.</p><p>\u201cCould we sort out the endearments later?\u201d Dane asked, obviously annoyed. \u201cJust to be sure, I want you to write down the names of every man you came in contact with at that shelter. I want Anthony Anders to check them all out.\u201d</p><p>Alea groaned. \u201cDane, I didn\u2019t catch most of their names. I tended to call them things like \u2018Overly Hairy Guy\u2019 and \u2018Dude Who Needs Deodorant.\u2019 I had a very fluid role there. I doubt that most of those men knew my name, either. It wasn\u2019t like I wore a nametag or distributed my bio. I\u2019m not trying to be difficult. I\u2019m just telling you all the reasons I\u2019m pretty sure this is a dead end.\u201d</p><p>The curtain to the back of the cabin opened, and a heavenly smell wafted through. Coop\u2019s stomach rumbled. The rich really did know how to travel.</p> <p>The hostess walked out with a smile on her face, like she was genuinely happy to be serving them. \u201cMay I serve the first course of lunch now? It\u2019s a lovely French onion soup, which will be followed with an herb salad with goat cheese croustades. The main course, a beef burgundy, should pair perfectly with the wine from the captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Alea said, sitting up. \u201cIt smells wonderful. I hope you try it yourself.\u201d</p><p>The hostess inclined her head in a show of deference. Staff tended to love Alea. \u201cI would be thrilled to try it, Your Highness. You\u2019re so kind. If you would gather around the table, I will serve.\u201d</p><p>Dane frowned and closed the folder. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get back to this. I\u2019m not going to stop until we know who did this to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t,\u201d Alea conceded. \u201cBut it can wait until after lunch. Poor Landon is practically fainting.\u201d</p><p>Lan did look a little piqued. He stood up. \u201cThere was no meat with breakfast. It was all bread and stuff. I\u2019m a carnivore.\u201d</p><p>The hostess returned and set glasses before them, each filled with a deep, ruby red wine. \u201cThe pilot says that this vintage comes from the region of France in which he was born. Enjoy.\u201d</p><p>Cooper took a long sip of the wine. It was rich and tasted just slightly sweet, with a hint of tartness. Like Alea. But he wasn\u2019t much of a wine drinker. Give him a good beer any day. But so far, the flight attendant hadn\u2019t given them water or anything else to drink. So he took another sip.</p><p>They sat down around the table, getting ready to partake of their first full meal as a family\u2014whether Alea wanted to acknowledge that fact or not. They drank and talked, the minutes speeding by.</p><p>The first course was served, and Cooper felt his every muscle relax. He laughed at something Dane said, but suddenly sounds were strangely far away. So was everyone in his field of vision. Even his muscles felt heavy. In fact, he couldn\u2019t quite lift the spoon.</p><p>Alea looked so happy, relaxed. And he felt so...weird.</p><p>He tried to push the glass away because something was so wrong, but his hands wouldn\u2019t work. They kind of flopped around like fish out of water.</p><p>What the hell was happening?</p><p>\u201cSir? Sir? Are you all right?\u201d He could halfway hear the hostess. She sounded like she was talking through a funnel.</p><p>Cooper tried to get up. His vision was narrowing, focusing in on one thing. Alea was asleep again. She looked so sweet, but...hadn\u2019t she just napped? Why was her head at that unnatural angle?</p><p>He tried to fight, tried to stay awake, but he failed.</p><p>The last thing he saw as he fell asleep was an unfamiliar man in a white shirt standing over them, wearing a triumphant smile.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Dane fought the darkness in his head as though his subconscious knew his sleep was unnatural.</p><p>He heard a low groan to his left before something rolled closer and closer, but he couldn\u2019t open his eyes to see or move in time to prevent it from smacking his head. Pain flared.</p><p>What the hell had happened?</p><p>Using all his concentration, Dane shoved his lethargy aside and forced himself upright. His head throbbed as he reached up and wiped away a trickle of blood. He looked down at the wine bottle that had spun down the aisle and struck him. And now his head pounded. His tongue felt double its normal size and a bit furry.</p><p>Fuck, they\u2019d been drugged. How long had he been out? He held up the bottle before it rolled down and hit anyone else. And he stared at it. Someone\u2014the flight attendant?\u2014had drugged them with this wine. The hostess had served the soup, but none of them had eaten a single bite of it before passing out. The good news was, Dane didn\u2019t think any of them had imbibed more than a half a glass. He glanced at his watch. About an hour since he\u2019d last looked. What the hell was going on?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Lan moaned. \u201cDid someone run me over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Alea?\u201d Coop asked, his words slurring.</p><p>Alea. Panic threatened to take over. They were on a fucking plane. Who would abduct her on a goddamn plane? And how?</p><p>They all looked around, groaning as they rose to their feet and stumbled around the cabin, searching for her. Shit, he felt like he was in a fun house that wasn\u2019t a whole lot of fun. His vision was like looking through a tunnel, and the floor seemed to tilt down just slightly. He lurched forward and saw Alea, grabbing onto her seat for balance. Relief flooded his system, and his heart started beating again.</p><p>\u201cHuh? I need to sleep,\u201d she protested, all cuddled up in her chair, safe and sound and still in the drug\u2019s happy place.</p><p>Dane started to relax. She was safe. Then, as his own head cleared, he realized something was really wrong. It wasn\u2019t just his perception leading him to think the floor was tilting a bit downward. It actually was. The whole nose of the plane was, in fact. He had to get her\u2014and all of them\u2014out of here fucking fast.</p><p>\u201cNo sleep for you, baby.\u201d He turned to Coop and Lan, who staggered behind him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get her up. We\u2019ve all been drugged. I don\u2019t think we got much of it, but I have no idea how she\u2019ll react to it. She weighs less than we do, so she won\u2019t metabolize it as fast. I need you two to figure out how fucked we are. There\u2019s no way we aren\u2019t. So find out how far we\u2019re about to take it up the ass.\u201d</p><p>Coop shuddered, obviously feeling the effects, but he rallied. \u201cIt had to be the pilot or the flight attendant.\u201d</p><p>Since one had brought the wine and the other had served it... \u201cYeah. Where the hell are they? I think the plane is diving, and if someone\u2019s going to try to kill us before we deal with that, I\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>He looked around the cabin, but he encountered nothing but the eerie white noise made by the engines.</p><p>Lan staggered, then forced himself to stand tall. He looked out the window. \u201cDiving? Is the pilot trying to crash the plane? There\u2019s nothing but ocean. Where the hell are we?\u201d</p><p>Coop ran a hand over his head. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve flown and I\u2019m not familiar with planes like this, but I\u2019ll figure it out. If the pilot doesn\u2019t shoot me first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you gear up,\u201d Dane said, looking down at Alea. Her color was good, her lips curving up in sleep.</p><p>\u201cMy gun is still in its holster,\u201d Lan said, pulling his SIG Sauer from underneath his jacket. \u201cWhy would the person who drugged us leave us with guns? Why wouldn\u2019t they just kill us in our sleep?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t make a lick of sense. If whoever had poisoned the wine wanted them unconscious, why wouldn\u2019t they have used that time to disarm the three big bad soldiers? Or kill everyone since there\u2019d be hell to pay once the drug wore off. What the fuck was going on here?</p><p>Coop took out his piece and started for the cockpit, his feet moving silently across the floor while Lan went in the opposite direction, gun drawn, in search of the hostess. Alone, he stood over Alea.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Princess. Get up and don\u2019t freak out on me. I\u2019m going to have to touch you,\u201d Dane explained.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. They had almost a dreamy quality to them. God, she was so beautiful. Even in the midst of life or death, he couldn\u2019t not notice how fucking gorgeous she was. Especially when she looked so soft and sleepy. Welcoming. That was how she would look after they made love to her, when she\u2019d taken them all and they surrounded her. She\u2019d look happy and exhausted and satisfied.</p><p>\u201cYou have to touch me? Oh, what a shame. Which part are you going to touch, babe?\u201d</p><p>He felt his eyebrows rise. \u201cBabe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call me baby. I get to call you babe. Or maybe I should go with sweetie pie.\u201d Her voice was low and languid. Seductive.</p><p>Wow, she was high. Apparently a little wine and some sedatives did wonders for her disposition. \u201cYou can call me anything you like, Princess, but right now you\u2019re getting on your feet.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her lips pursing in a sweet pout. \u201cNo. Need sleep. But you can touch me. You like my breasts? Touch mine. Second base.\u201d She giggled before sleep overtook her again.</p><p>Oh, what he would do to her if they weren\u2019t potentially in a fight for their lives.</p><p>\u201cYes, Princess, we\u2019ll get to second base eventually\u2014and way beyond\u2014but right now I need you to stand. Up we go.\u201d He lifted her, forcing her to her feet.</p><p>Alea groaned and tried to wiggle away from him. \u201cThis is mean. I\u2019m having a good dream. Go away.\u201d</p><p>He needed to get some coffee in her, but even if the hostess suddenly appeared and offered some, he wouldn\u2019t trust that it hadn\u2019t been drugged either. But damn, where had the flight crew gone? Had they managed to get off the plane somehow? They couldn\u2019t have opened the door. Despite what happened in movies, the pressure from the outside would keep the door closed, no matter how hard someone tried to push. They would have to blow the door. If that had happened, there would be nothing between the pressurized cabin and the great outdoors now, and they would all have been sucked out of the plane already.</p><p>Since he, Alea, and the guys were still in the plane, it followed that whoever had drugged them was still on board, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou feel nice. So much muscle.\u201d Alea sighed as she leaned against him, her fingers running over his torso as if she wanted to touch him all over.</p><p>Adrenaline had already given him a hard-on. He did not need her making it worse. \u201cBaby, I need you to focus.\u201d</p><p>Lan pushed the curtains aside that separated the main cabin from the back. He had his backpack in his hands and tossed it on one of the chairs, rifling through it as he spoke. \u201cThe hostess is dead. Someone whacked her over the head with something heavy, maybe a pan. It\u2019s not pretty back there. Lots of blood. I doubt she\u2019s the one who drugged us. Since I don\u2019t think we have a stowaway, that leaves the pilot. He hit her a couple of times. I checked the whole back, but couldn\u2019t find the fucker.</p><p>Fuck. \u201cWhere is he? We need to find him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s in there.\u201d Cooper hitched a thumb back toward the cockpit. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>That was bad news. Could Cooper fly the plane? He\u2019d only handled small aircraft with propellers before.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s dead?\u201d Alea asked, her head coming up from Dane\u2019s chest. \u201cDead is sad. No one should be dead. Except for Khalil. He was an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Lan asked. \u201cCoop, maybe you should have a look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a lightweight,\u201d Dane shot back. \u201cCoop needs to fly the plane.\u201d</p> <p>Alea gasped and tried to step back. \u201cAm I on drugs again? Did I take drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Dane pulled her closer, unwilling to let her get very far. She raised her arms and gave him an ineffectual push, trying to put distance between them. But the struggle was short-lived, and she finally let him hold her. \u201cSomeone drugged the wine. You didn\u2019t have much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t relapse. Can\u2019t go back there. Can\u2019t.\u201d Tears streamed down her face.</p><p>She was talking about the shit her captors had addicted her to. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of you, baby. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDane, we have bigger problems,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe pilot poisoned himself, but not before he also killed the radio and all the electrical equipment, then dumped most of the fuel.\u201d</p><p>Cooper\u2019s words landed like a bomb in the cabin, diving toward the earth even now.</p> <p>\u201cAre you telling me that we\u2019re over the Indian Ocean and we don\u2019t have any fuel?\u201d Dane asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the fuck we are. I don\u2019t know how long we\u2019ve been in flight. I don\u2019t have a fucking longitude or latitude. I don\u2019t have a goddamn radio to call for help because that dead fucker made sure that we\u2019re going to go down without any hope of sending out a distress signal,\u201d Cooper said between clenched teeth.</p><p>Dane pushed down his burst of panic. He had to take things in hand or the others might fall the fuck apart. \u201cCooper, we\u2019re not in trouble because you\u2019re going to fly the plane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve never flown anything like this,\u201d Cooper replied. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not really flying since we\u2019re going to be completely out of fuel in about five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll glide us down.\u201d Landon seemed to have picked up on Dane\u2019s calm vibe. \u201cWe have a couple of minutes. What are our options? Do you see any land where we can set down? Should I look for parachutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParachutes won\u2019t work,\u201d Dane replied, settling Alea into a chair. He didn\u2019t want to leave her alone, but this was getting damn fucking serious. This plane and everyone in it was going down. He had ten minutes tops to formulate the best plan for their survival. \u201cThe pressure against the door will make it impossible to open until we get closer to the water. Our best bet is to try to find a place to put the plane down. Coop, I need you in that cockpit. If we\u2019re lucky, maybe we\u2019re not far off the coast of Indonesia or one of its islands. Go look.\u201d</p><p>Cooper nodded and disappeared again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even have a cell signal,\u201d Lan said, looking down at his phone.</p> <p>\u201cCell towers don\u2019t cover great swaths of water, man. But we all have apps on our phones that could be helpful. Everyone try to waterproof your phones. And save as much battery life as you can. Lan, get every bit of food you can find in back in case we aren\u2019t rescued immediately. We\u2019re going to need water. And see if there\u2019s a life raft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Alea asked a bit more lucidly, pushing her hair back with trembling hands.</p><p>His first instinct was to coddle and protect her, tell her not to worry and to go back to sleep, but she was more than a pretty doll. She was a brave woman, and he was going to need every available hand and resource if they had any hope of getting out of this alive.</p><p>Dane sank to one knee and took her hands in his. \u201cOur plane has been sabotaged, and we\u2019re crashing. We need to do everything possible to mitigate the damage and find a way to survive. I need you to focus.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, genuine tears running down her face, but he watched as she visibly straightened her spine and gathered her strength. \u201cOkay. The cushions are floatation devices. There should be an inflatable raft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pilot took a knife to it,\u201d Lan said, tossing a big yellow thing into the cabin. \u201cIt\u2019s useless as a raft, but we could build a desalination unit with it. If we can find some land. I tossed the clothes out of this case. I think it was the hostess\u2019s. It\u2019s now holding water bottles and a bunch of snacks. Hope you like crackers, peanuts, and p\u00e2t\u00e9. What the fuck is p\u00e2t\u00e9 made of?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have time to teach Landon about the art of fine cuisine. \u201cAnything we can use to fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got land!\u201d Cooper shouted.</p><p>Dane shoved down his relief. It wasn\u2019t over yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find something.\u201d Lan moved quicker, running to the back of the plane again.</p><p>Alea stood just as the plane jerked and the engines died. She staggered, and the truth hit him. No more fuel. They were coasting now, and that could be very bad because they were dependent on a lot of factors they couldn\u2019t control, like the wind, the current, and their speed.</p><p>Alea lurched toward the cockpit just as the plane started to take a nosedive. It almost immediately corrected with a jerk, then tilted the opposite direction. She tumbled, but Dane threw an arm around her waist, hauling her close. She stiffened but calmed, then stepped through the door with a gasp.</p><p>Damn it. The body. Cooper had shoved the pilot to the floor and now occupied his seat, his hand on the yoke. The pilot had definitely poisoned himself, as evidenced by his blue lips and the empty cup he clutched in his hand. Dead eyes stared up into nothingness.</p><p>Why the fuck would the pilot kill the hostess and himself, then sabotage the plane and leave him and the others alive?</p><p>\u201cAlea, come on. You don\u2019t need to be here.\u201d Dane urged her toward the door. The last thing he needed was for her to freak out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She pulled out her phone, all business. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my first dead body. Cooper, how can I help? Do you need latitude and longitude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cCan you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlea, baby, there\u2019s no signal,\u201d Dane pointed out. She wasn\u2019t thinking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a signal,\u201d Alea insisted. \u201cThe magnetic poles work just fine without a satellite signal. Zero-seven and thirty degrees north by one hundred thirty-four and thirty east. I think we\u2019ve crossed past the Indian Ocean and into the western Pacific. We\u2019re way off course, probably somewhere near the Philippines. It looks like there are lots of little islands out there.\u201d She seemed to notice everyone staring at her. She shrugged a little. \u201cWhat? I liked taking geography and I\u2019m really good at memorization.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She sounded competent. Dane looked out over the horizon. Sure enough he could see little tiny dots of green and gold in an endless sea of blue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how far away that is.\u201d Cooper wiped away the sweat dotting his forehead. \u201cWe started at about thirty-five thousand feet. Damn, it\u2019s been so long. My father made us all learn how to fly cropdusters, but they were little prop planes. I had a little training in the Navy, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the wind like, tail or head?\u201d Alea asked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should be able to feel it, but I\u2019m still a bit woozy.\u201d</p><p>Coop visibly calmed as Alea spoke, as though focusing and doing his level best to save her. \u201cIt\u2019s a tail wind, baby. It\u2019s at our back. Do you know anything about flying?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI do. I took lessons when I was a teenager and I studied hard. I always did. In a glide, we\u2019ll lose four to five thousand feet a minute. We\u2019re light and have a tail wind. We\u2019ve got around six or seven minutes. We\u2019re going to go past those patches of land, but like I said, there should be other islands in the region. Get us close, Coop. Even if we hit the water, we\u2019ll swim. At least I hope I can swim.\u201d</p><p>Damn, his girl was smart even when she\u2019d been drugged. A ridiculous pride surged in his chest. \u201cShe\u2019s right, Coop. You can do this. And Lea, don\u2019t you worry. Even if you\u2019re still weak, we\u2019ll get you to safety. I can swim with you on my back if I have to.\u201d</p><p>It would be rough, but if Coop could get them close to land, they could survive. Because they damn straight wouldn\u2019t last in the open ocean. This was warm water. Sharks. Every Navy man knew the story of the USS Indianapolis. She went down in the Central Pacific during World War II, and three hundred were lost in the sinking. The remaining nine hundred or so went into the water. During the next four days, almost six hundred men were consumed by sharks.</p><p>These were the waters below. No fucking shark was going to take his crew. They were going to live, goddamn it.</p><p>First, he had to hope that Coop could actually land the plane and keep it from breaking apart. Even if he set down on the water, they could all survive if the crash was controlled and they got to land fast.</p><p>Six minutes. He had six minutes.</p><p>Dane put a hand on Alea\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m going to help Lan. You keep Coop on the right path. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Her face turned up, and he saw a strength there that blew him away. \u201cWe\u2019ll be good. Get my suitcase. I\u2019m ridiculously organized and I pack for everything. I have a first aid kit and some other helpful things, including a box of protein bars. I wasn\u2019t sure I could find them in Australia. It\u2019s the Louis Vuitton roller case.\u201d</p><p>Well, of course. She would stave off Armageddon while wearing designer heels. \u201cWill do, baby.\u201d</p><p>He jogged back, determined to find that bag. Even if they dumped it in the ocean, if it was close enough, he could dive and find it.</p><p>Toward the back, he discovered that Lan had made a little mountain of crap on the floor. He\u2019d pulled out wires, blankets, a small tool kit. Yes. He\u2019d filled a backpack with extra water bottles and found enough odds and ends to build a desalinization port if they ran out of water.</p><p>The wire they could fashion into hooks and weapons. The sea would provide protein if they had the tools to get it. He knew enough about plants and herbs to know what to eat and what to avoid. They had the tools. They just needed the chance to survive.</p><p>He walked through the curtain and toward the back. Lan had decimated the food station. He\u2019d taken everything except the ceramic mugs. Mistake. Ceramic made great knives. They all had a few, but it never hurt to bring more. And he\u2019d left a pot. They would need that. The heavy plastic of the useless life raft would mean nothing if they didn\u2019t have a damn container. Potable water would be their first goal. The bottled stuff wouldn\u2019t last.</p><p>Lan walked through, carrying the luggage. He had all of their cases, including Alea\u2019s Louis Vuitton bag. \u201cI shoved some extra blankets and pillows into those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Did you find the flare guns?\u201d</p><p>Lan nodded. \u201cI wrapped them in plastic. They should be safe from the water.\u201d</p><p>The plane dipped, now at a steeper angle, nearly sending him careening forward. Closer to the ocean. The phantom of the Indianapolis played through his head. He couldn\u2019t let his men die. God, he couldn\u2019t let Alea die.</p><p>\u201cNo matches,\u201d Lan said, bracing himself against the wall.</p><p>The plane lurched again, the sensation causing Dane\u2019s stomach to roll. Faster and faster, they were going down.</p><p>\u201cSuit up,\u201d Dane barked.</p><p>If Coop set them down flat, keeping the nose up, they would float for a brief time. They could get the door open and get to land.</p><p>Dane could feel the force of the descent pulling them down, threatening to tear the plane apart. The whole aircraft shuddered. But Coop managed to bring the nose up again as he and Lan gathered all the stuff and shoved them into whatever packs and suitcases they could find.</p><p>\u201cGet ready,\u201d Dane shouted.</p><p>He grabbed the nearest backpack. All military guys carried them, big, weighty duffels with arm holes. He tossed one to Lan. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to pry the door open. When the water\u2019s two feet below, we start tossing out whatever we can\u2019t carry. It should float and if it doesn\u2019t, well, we know how to dive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn straight, brother, but we shouldn\u2019t have to. I found some rope. I was able to tie most of the luggage together. I\u2019ll haul it in.\u201d Lan\u2019s previous nerves had morphed into pure, grade-A special ops arrogance.</p><p>That was exactly what they needed because they didn\u2019t have anything left except for the stubborn belief that nothing and no one could take them down.</p><p>Dane stood at the door, braced himself, and threw it open. He stared down into the blue void below and prayed their stubborn arrogance was enough.</p><p>Alea felt her stomach roll, but forced the bile back down. She\u2019d never particularly loved flying, even when she\u2019d learned how to do it. She\u2019d taken the lessons for the same reason she did everything; it had been expected of her. Her cousins had learned, so she had, too, even when her hands had shaken. Even when everything in her body had screamed at her to stay on the ground. She\u2019d conquered her fear and learned to fly.</p> <p>Now she was going to learn how to crash.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s concentration was absolute. After the first couple of minutes, he\u2019d settled in and was now nothing but cocky confidence. \u201cBrace yourself, baby. We\u2019re going to hit the water hard.\u201d</p><p>She settled into the seat beside him and strapped herself down. On the horizon, she saw a tiny piece of land, yet another green jewel in a sea of blue. They would land as close to that little patch as possible.</p><p>Her hands shook. Nerves. Stress. God, she\u2019d been given some kind of drug. She hated drugs. She\u2019d fought so hard to get off them. She wanted to shove her fingers down her throat just to purge the rest out of her system. Now wasn\u2019t the time. Everything was still a little hazy, but she could remember plastering herself all over Dane. But she\u2019d deal with that humiliation later.</p><p>Dumb slut. No one wants you. When the money runs out, we\u2019ll just kill you and no one will miss you. You\u2019re worthless.</p> <p>God, she hated those voices, but they were always in her head, just waiting for the perfect time to start replaying and take her down. When she heard them, she just went to bed with her iPod on and her ear buds firmly in place. And she tried to forget. She couldn\u2019t do that now. She had to stay in the present.</p><p>No, more than that. She had to be useful. Alea refused to be another piece of luggage they had to haul around. They would do it. They would really put her on their backs and swim so they didn\u2019t leave her behind.</p><p>God, these men of steel with iron will and big hearts, would never leave her behind. Would they if they knew the things she\u2019d survived? Probably. They would save her if only because they were good to their cores. And they would feel sorry for her.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t know the whole truth. She wouldn\u2019t be able to stand their pity.</p><p>Cooper fought with the yoke, trying to angle the plane to ensure their best chance at survival.</p><p>A loud bang shot through the little plane.</p> <p>\u201cDane? Lan?\u201d She started to tear off her seat belt. She had to help them.</p><p>Cooper didn\u2019t look away from the horizon. \u201cStop right there, Princess. They\u2019re fine. I bet Dane just blew the door. That shit-ass island doesn\u2019t come equipped with a runway. I can\u2019t put us down on land. The trees are too thick. Unless... Baby, go back and sit with Dane.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. Alea knew damn well what he was planning, and it wasn\u2019t happening. \u201cYeah, sure. I\u2019ll leave this seat when you land. In the water.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. The plane jerked again. \u201cIt would be best if I set us down on land. That way you\u2019ll have the plane to take refuge in, and the metal can be seen from above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid, Cooper. The chance of the cockpit not folding in and killing everyone inside is miniscule if you take us into those trees. I\u2019m staying where I am.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t play the martyr if it meant killing her, too. No way. No how.</p><p>Yes, they would lose the plane, but they would all have a shot at living.</p><p>And suddenly she knew deep down how significant that was. The question had floated through her head for a long time, since the moment she\u2019d been taken...was living really important? She\u2019d fought to survive in Colombia, but mostly because instinct had urged her. The human animal fought for its life, for the right to continue breathing from one moment to the next. But Alea had wondered in the darkest recesses of her soul whether she actually wanted to live. Because living was more than taking her next breath. Living meant being brave. Living meant taking chances.</p><p>Yes. She wanted to live.</p> <p>She wanted a chance to be like the woman she\u2019d once been, a little bold, mostly unafraid. She couldn\u2019t go back in time, but she could move forward. In some ways, she\u2019d never really left the dank, filthy cell of her captivity. Piper had been right.</p><p>It was time to shed the pathetic Alea who had hidden in her room, burying her head in the sand and building walls around herself to keep out everyone who tried to help her. She needed the Alea she\u2019d been before, the one who strove to be the best, studied the hardest, helped those around her. That Alea had been in a coma, but it was time for her to wake the fuck up. She might not deserve a shot at happiness, but she wanted one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not moving, Coop.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t leave any one of them to die the way she\u2019d left that girl. Gritting her teeth, she shoved the image away. \u201cSo you better set us down easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Lea. One of these days\u2014soon\u2014I\u2019m going to spank your ass bright red.\u201d Cooper pulled the yoke and the nose came up again.</p><p>The plane shuddered. She braced herself. He would let the tail touch to slow them down. That\u2019s what she would do in his place. They wanted the plane to float for as long as possible.</p><p>Time seemed to speed up as the island loomed closer and closer. Distance and time meshed together in a horrifying carnival ride. The sound of the plane screamed against her ears, blocking out the rest of the world. The skyline tilted, a brief flash of greens and browns. Then she was thrown back. Alea\u2019s head slammed against the headrest as the plane went almost vertical. It stood there for one terrifying moment and then belly flopped, striking the water with bone-jarring force.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move, Princess.\u201d Cooper had hit his head at some point. A thin trickle of blood streamed down his face, but he moved with surety, unbuckling his belt, then her own. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to swim for it.\u201d</p><p>Yes, but they were alive.</p><p>She nodded and jumped up. The plane was bobbing in the waves, white foam cresting up the window.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d As soon as they reached land, she needed to dress and clean that wound, stop the bleeding. Infection was their enemy, so she had to prevent it. She had antibiotic ointment in her first aid kit.</p><p>\u201cCoop? You two okay?\u201d Dane staggered to the doorway, his big body taking up all the space. Alea wanted nothing more than to throw herself into those strong arms and hold him, but they had to hit the water and swim for land.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, but we won\u2019t float forever. If we\u2019re getting stuff off this plane, we need to do it now. Come on, Lea. We\u2019ve got to move.\u201d Cooper turned her, pressing her toward Dane.</p><p>She nearly tripped over the body of the pilot. She forced her gaze away from the dead man and allowed Dane to pull her into the cabin. The door was open, and Landon was already in the water, surrounded by pieces of luggage and bags he\u2019d tied together forming a long train of survival gear.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good five hundred yards to the beach,\u201d Lan shouted up. \u201cI swam out a little. There\u2019s a beast of an undertow.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the greatest swimmer in the world and she was still hazier than she\u2019d like. Dane had one of the cushions in his hand and he\u2019d used some rope to tie it around her, placing the cushion on her back. \u201cSwim as long as you can. When you get tired, flip over on your back and I\u2019ll drag you in. Just keep your head up and lose the shoes, baby. There\u2019s no need for Prada here.\u201d</p><p>Alea slipped out of the shoes, her hands shaking despite the heat she felt shimmering outside. Dane dove into the water, then she stepped forward. Landon was starting for shore, dragging the train of luggage behind him. It looked like he\u2019d tied the rope around his waist. His body moved swiftly despite the undertow, showing no signs that the added weight held him back at all.</p><p>Dane surfaced, slicking his hair back and holding a hand up for her to join him. Despite the horrors of the last few minutes, he paused to encourage her. \u201cCome on in. The water\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>The water was also a clear, crystal blue. As she stood in the doorway, she could see down into the water, despite its depth. A coral reef lurked below. She couldn\u2019t tell how far down it was, but it was farther than Dane\u2019s kicking feet. That had to be good enough.</p><p>\u201cGo on, Lea,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe water is about to start coming in the door. Once that happens, the plane will sink fast. Go!\u201d</p><p>Alea sucked in a deep breath and jumped. In seconds, warm water surrounded her. Almost immediately she felt the floatation device around her waist yank her to the surface as surely as Dane\u2019s hands. He helped her right her body and pushed the wet hair from her face.</p><p>Deep blue eyes stared into her own, silently demanding her focus. \u201cStay with us. I\u2019m going to tether us together so you can\u2019t drift off.\u201d</p><p>In the distance, Landon was almost to the shore. Cooper splashed in behind her, then came to her side. Dane swam to the other, and together, they started for the shore. Alea kept pace, not wanting to fall behind or drag them down. She looked back, but only briefly saw as the plane that was supposed to take her to freedom began to sink to its watery grave.</p><p>She stared forward resolutely. She\u2019d brought them into her nightmare. She wasn\u2019t going to let them down.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>As the sun started to sink over the horizon, Cooper thought about running from Alea. And then he thought about it again. But the truth of the matter was, she would only find him. And she\u2019d only be more pissed off.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move. I just want to clean it.\u201d She walked up to him with a small red kit in her hands.</p><p>According to Cooper\u2019s watch, two hours had passed since the plane had sunk below the surface and into the ocean. In two hours they\u2019d managed to build a fire, gather palm fronds and bamboo for an eventual shelter, and scout around what was now their base camp. The island was tiny. It had taken Landon a whole twenty minutes to jog the circumference.</p><p>But in that two hours, the one thing he\u2019d managed not to do was give in to Alea\u2019s sudden desire to play nurse. It looked like that time had come to an end.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really, I used to be a medic. This little cut is nothing. Just hand me a bandage and it will be fine.\u201d Cooper went back to sorting through the food and water.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only a little cut until bacteria gets inside. Then it becomes a flaming septic pus-filled wound that kills you within forty-eight hours,\u201d Alea explained, wielding her first aid kit like a sword. \u201cI won\u2019t even go into all the bugs that would just love to burrow under your skin and make a nice home for themselves.\u201d</p><p>Cooper shrugged. \u201cI got saltwater all in it. Salt can be very purifying.\u201d</p><p>Alea looked over his shoulder to where Dane was digging a pit. \u201cCan\u2019t you command him or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to command you to get out of those wet clothes,\u201d Dane said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t do me any good. He\u2019s a damn fine medic, as well as the absolute worst patient who ever walked the earth. He\u2019s a complete pansy when it comes to stuff like this. Oh, you can shoot him and he won\u2019t complain, but try taking off the band aid and he\u2019ll howl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of pain,\u201d Cooper grumbled.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t really had a choice the couple of times he\u2019d been shot. The assholes who\u2019d shot him hadn\u2019t brought him in for a consult on the situation. He looked up at Alea, his brain processing what Dane had said and finding something he might be willing to endure that sting to get. She was still in clothes. Despite the heat of the day, it was humid. They stood under the shade of the trees. She was still soaking wet.</p><p>The rest of them had immediately stripped down to their boxers and laid their clothes out to dry. Though Alea had unpacked some of the clothes they\u2019d salvaged, they were wet, along with everything that hadn\u2019t been wrapped in plastic. She\u2019d fashioned a clothesline by tying some rope between two palm trees and hung their garments to dry. But she was still in her skirt and top.</p><p>\u201cCooper Evans, you are going to let me clean and dress that wound,\u201d she said, her mouth firming.</p><p>Somehow, after years of fighting with his older brothers and dealing with Special Forces commanding officers, the gorgeous set of curves in front of him just wasn\u2019t very scary. Sexy? Hell, yeah. And it was about to get a hell of a lot sexier. \u201cNegotiate with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her mocha-colored eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cLife is a negotiation, Princess. You took all those political science courses. You should know plenty about that.\u201d Yeah, he liked this idea. It had been a crapfuckingtastic day. This could make it all a little nicer. \u201cSo let\u2019s negotiate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her bare foot tapped on the sand. \u201cFine. I want to save your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to save yours in return. Take off the clothes, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rolled. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold, Lea. You\u2019ve got goose bumps all over your skin. It\u2019s going to get worse as that sun goes down.\u201d He and Dane had already talked about the fact that, after sunset, the temperature would drop. The blankets wouldn\u2019t have had time to dry out. Alea needed to sleep close to the fire, and she would need body heat. But none of that would help much if she wasn\u2019t dry first.</p> <p>She frowned. \u201cI\u2019m not walking around here naked.\u201d</p><p>Just a little give. That was all he needed. \u201cYour panties and bra will dry a lot faster if you strip out of everything else.\u201d</p><p>She turned around, and for a moment he thought he was going to lose. Then she tossed the first aid kit his way. \u201cAll right, damn it. Don\u2019t expect me to be gentle.\u201d</p><p>With jerky, slightly nervous motions, she tore into the buttons of her shirt. Once she\u2019d undone them all, she shrugged the garment off and settled the heavy fabric over the clothesline before she shoved at the waistband of her skirt. She was wearing a plain white cotton underwire bra and panties, but plain didn\u2019t begin to cover just how gorgeous she was.</p><p>Fuck. She had curves for miles. She was built to please a man, and he damn straight wanted to be that man. Well, one of three. Somehow the whole near-death experience was making it way easier to realize that they might not have time to waste. Tomorrow might be now. If they wanted her, they were going to have to find just the right way to take her.</p> <p>And they\u2019d do it together. Coop knew he wouldn\u2019t have survived without his brothers. Without the three of them, Alea would have died or she would have been stranded alone. They wouldn\u2019t have the bounty of supplies they\u2019d gathered without Dane and Lan. And god bless him, Lan had fought that vicious current to bring all of those necessities to the island. They could survive quite nicely for a while because everyone had done their part, including his sweet Alea. She\u2019d calmed quickly and figured out their coordinates, then settled into the cockpit to help him land, and he was in awe. She seemed to soak up and retain most everything that anyone had ever taught her.</p><p>The four of them made a damn good team. If they were lucky, they could make a fine family.</p><p>Alea turned, a blush high in her cheeks. \u201cFine. Now I\u2019m almost naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt covers more than most bikinis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wear bikinis,\u201d Alea said.</p><p>Dane was suddenly at his side. There was a happy, hungry look on the big guy\u2019s face that only happened when he got around Alea. \u201cI just thought I should help.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, right. Dane wanted to get as close to the candy as he could. Not that Cooper blamed the guy, but he\u2019d been the one to unwrap the treat.</p><p>\u201cYour help isn\u2019t required, but thanks for playing.\u201d Coop made a sound like a rude game show host\u2019s buzzer. Then he turned back to Alea. \u201cDid you learn to swim as a kid?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you swim as a teenager?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I was as rambunctious as any other kid. Bezakistan gets too hot in the summer to play outside much, and I didn\u2019t like being trapped indoors all day. My aunt and uncles took us to the shore at least once a year, so swimming was a necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t swim now?\u201d</p><p>Alea got on her knees in front of him and opened the little kit. With an air of \u201cwhatever,\u201d she started digging out the instruments of his torture\u2014little cotton balls and packs of antiseptic. \u201cNot much anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good exercise, and you\u2019re right about the summers in Bezakistan. So why did you stop?\u201d Cooper asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She seemed to want to look everywhere except at him. She focused intently on dabbing the cleaner on a cotton ball.</p><p>\u201cWhen exactly did you stop?\u201d Dane asked in that deep voice, his Dom voice. Cooper knew his buddy meant business. \u201cNo lying.\u201d</p><p>Alea shrugged. \u201cA couple of years ago. Hold still.\u201d</p><p>She pressed the cotton ball to his cut, and he nearly came out of his seat. Damn it, that burned. He cursed, and Alea\u2019s lips turned up.</p><p>\u201cReally, you big baby?\u201d she mocked. \u201cYou\u2019re a SEAL?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he got that a lot. He touched the tat on his left arm. It was a SEAL tattoo of an eagle clutching a rifle, anchor, and trident. \u201cI even have the tat, baby. But I\u2019m out of the Navy now. I don\u2019t have to suck it up anymore.\u201d</p><p>Dane huffed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t suck it up then. I was with you in Kandahar. You took one measly knife to the gut and whined about it for hours.\u201d</p><p>Alea gasped. \u201cSomeone stabbed you in the stomach?\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the nice little scar on his right side. \u201cYep. And I was very heroic. I saved three kids and stitched up some soldiers before I finally lost consciousness in a very manly fashion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe face-planted on the street,\u201d Dane clarified, then turned his attention back to Alea. \u201cSo you stopped swimming after the abduction. Why? The warm water and solitude should have been relaxing. Did you quit so you could avoid bathing suits and hide your body?\u201d</p><p>Crap! Cooper bit back a protest. He\u2019d just gotten Alea to strip down to her skivvies and he\u2019d been trying to make her nice and comfortable. Did Dane really have to push her now?</p><p>She paused, hesitated, then very cautiously continued to clean his wound. \u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dane\u2019s voice was softer as though she\u2019d pleased him by answering. \u201cBaby, whatever they told you, they were lying.\u201d</p><p>Had the fuckwads who\u2019d taken her told her she wasn\u2019t pretty? He reached up and caressed her hair, pushing one side away from her face. It had dried into sexy waves, rather than that stick-straight mane she unmercifully flat ironed every day. \u201cUnless they said you\u2019re the most beautiful woman on the planet, they were lying. Lea, baby, they would have said anything to break you.\u201d</p><p>She took a long breath, studying her handiwork on the side of his face, seemingly happy. Then she started looking through the kit again. \u201cThey might be liars, but I\u2019ve always had issues with my weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat issues?\u201d Cooper asked, truly astounded at the thought. \u201cIs it hard to be perfect?\u201d</p><p>She snorted slightly. \u201cYes, it\u2019s so difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlea, I would seriously consider what you say about yourself in the next few minutes,\u201d Dane warned. \u201cI\u2019m willing to listen to concerns, but don\u2019t degrade yourself.\u201d</p><p>Her hands balled into fists on her lap. \u201cI\u2019m not a size two. God, Dane, I\u2019m not even a size eight. It wasn\u2019t just my captors. The press hasn\u2019t always been kind.\u201d</p><p>Cooper had no idea what dress sizes meant. \u201cUh, if those are smaller than you, then I\u2019m glad because I want a woman with curves. I want a woman who looks like a woman. Ask most guys. They do, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLea, you should damn well know that most women modeling in magazines are far too thin. They might photograph well, but it\u2019s actually unhealthy,\u201d Dane said. \u201cWho idolizes models? Do you think it\u2019s men? No, baby. Mostly women. Porn is a better example of what men like. Those women have hips and boobs.\u201d</p><p>Cooper sniffed with disdain. \u201cI only watch the amateur stuff now because the pros have gotten too thin. And I like real boobs.\u201d Alea had real boobs. They were encased in a sturdy bra, but they were totally getting his attention. Soft and round. They would be a sweet handful. And last night, with her distraught...and then his mouth on her pussy, he hadn\u2019t really gotten a good look at her ass. But what he\u2019d seen in the past always looked so damn good. \u201cNot to mention a juicy ass. Love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuicy is good,\u201d Dane agreed.</p><p>Alea squirted ointment onto her finger and quickly wiped it across his cut. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to try to make me feel better. Growing up, I always wanted to look more like Yasmin. Taller. More graceful...\u201d</p><p>Dane made gagging noises.</p><p>Coop joined in. \u201cNo girl looks good with her head that far up her own ass. A bony-looking ass, I might add.\u201d</p><p>Alea shook her head and giggled. \u201cYou two are so juvenile. Really? She\u2019s blonde and willowy, and she doesn\u2019t have to have her dresses custom made. I had to pay through the nose to get that Narciso Rodriguez gown. They don\u2019t normally make my size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they suck. And you look gorgeous in anything you wear.\u201d Coop frowned.</p><p>He didn\u2019t normally notice Alea\u2019s clothes. He noticed how her boobs and butt looked in them. And he loved her toes right now. It was kind of freaky, but he wanted to suck on them and rub them. They were a pretty pink.</p><p>She slapped a butterfly-style bandage over his cheek and stood. \u201cI think that should prevent infection from setting in. Keep it covered until it closes. And you two don\u2019t have to be nice. I appreciate it. I really do, but I own a mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it must be your eyesight that\u2019s suffering.\u201d Dane stood beside her. \u201cCooper is never just nice.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as if she was a bit uncomfortable with their compliments. Or maybe it was the way they stared. Because he couldn\u2019t seem to stop. Her nipples clung to the thin white cotton of her bra. God, he wanted to get those nipples in his mouth. He could suck on them and bite them just the tiniest bit until she squirmed. And begged. He\u2019d really like to hear her begging.</p><p>\u201cOf course Cooper is nice. He\u2019s not really interested,\u201d Alea said, then blushed. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to try to convince me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that was my mouth on your pussy last night,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>And Dane just rolled his eyes. \u201cYou really are blind, Lea. His cock is poking out of his boxers. Dude, shove that thing back in.\u201d</p><p>Cooper readjusted, but not before he noticed that Alea\u2019s eyes widened at the sight. Her breath hitched. Yes, she was at least a little intrigued.</p><p>And they were on a deserted island with absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to be. Sure, they were having to fight for their lives, but Cooper believed in the power of positive thinking. Anything could happen. In fact, he was damn sure hoping everything did happen soon.</p><p>\u201cAre they angry with us again?\u201d Dane asked with a grin as he ran one finger over her hard nipple.</p><p>She immediately crossed her arms over her chest, blocking him...though he could see some great cleavage. \u201cI\u2019m just cold.\u201d</p><p>Cooper opened his arms wide. \u201cCome here, baby. We can warm you up.\u201d</p><p>Another blush stole across her face. \u201cI liked it better when you were all moody and standoffish.\u201d</p><p>Dane shook his head. \u201cThat didn\u2019t work out for us, so we\u2019re trying something new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be worried about survival?\u201d Alea asked, turning away.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you won the lottery. You went down with three former Special Forces soldiers.\u201d Cooper stood. It was completely reasonable that she was scared and wondering about the basic necessities. What did a princess know about survival training? He wanted to hold her, but she might be scared that his dingus would likely make another appearance. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah,\u201d Dane added. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve done this in far worse circumstances. This is practically the Ritz compared to that time we got stranded in the Dashti Margo. We were tracking some Taliban scum. We took care of them, but our Humvee got blown to smithereens.\u201d</p><p>Cooper shook his head. \u201cTaken out by an RPG. Damn, we moved fast to get away from that one. Good times, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds horrible.\u201d Alea had turned to face them again, still valiantly trying to cover up.</p><p>\u201cIt was absolutely awful,\u201d Cooper admitted. \u201cWe spent ten days in the desert until we were located and someone sent transport. We survived with virtually no supplies while hostiles were shooting at us. We\u2019ll survive this, baby. Living here will be a cakewalk. A little vacation.\u201d He caressed her arm in what he hoped was a reassuring gesture, trying not to think about how soft she was and how good all that would feel up against him. \u201cWe left word with your cousins that we were traveling with you. We didn\u2019t bother to mention the whole sneaking away part, but they know when to expect the plane to land. They\u2019ll send out search and rescue.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled a little. \u201cIt\u2019s a big ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn water this clear, the plane might well be visible.\u201d Dane said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re patient men.\u201d</p><p>Tears formed in her eyes, and she looked down at her bare feet. \u201cI did this to us.\u201d</p><p>Oh, damn, she couldn\u2019t think that. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d He couldn\u2019t restrain himself a minute more. He walked up to her. \u201cI want to hold you. Can I, please? Can Dane and I give you a little comfort? It\u2019s been a hard day. Let us reassure you that it\u2019s going to be all right.\u201d When she hesitated, he joked, \u201cI promise to keep the beast in my boxers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She rewarded him with a little laugh, then nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like that. For the most part, it\u2019s been a long time since I let anyone hold me. I want to try.\u201d</p><p>He eased forward cautiously, letting her observe his every move, giving her plenty of time to object. She was a little like a wild deer he wanted to feed from his hand. One wrong move and he could spook her.</p><p>\u201cMy hand is going to touch your waist, Lea,\u201d Dane said before settling in behind her. \u201cYou can lean back against me any time. You\u2019re cold. You need to get warm. We\u2019ll settle you by the fire, then have a nice dinner. Relax and know that we\u2019re going to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Cooper slowly wrapped his arms around her. She trembled for a moment, then sighed as though she appreciated the heat their bodies generated.</p> <p>Once again, he appreciated how soft her skin was and how sweetly she fit against him. \u201cConsider this a break from civilization. You wanted one, right? Here you go. No reporters. No one who needs your attention. Well, besides us. No one is going to ask you to make appearances or to go to balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo curious people who look at me with pity,\u201d Alea continued.</p><p>Coop wanted to take exception to that, but now wasn\u2019t the time to argue with her. Making her laugh seemed to work so much better. \u201cNope. You just have to worry about us ogling you. All the time. Every day. Every hour.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, she laughed. \u201cYou guys are crazy.\u201d</p><p>Dane had his cheek against her hair. \u201cMy main goal in life is to convince you that we\u2019re not. At least not completely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you not be mad at me? I\u2019m the reason you\u2019re here,\u201d she admitted in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI think I speak for all three of us when I say we wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else,\u201d Cooper replied. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t with you here, I\u2019d be going out of my damn mind with worry. But cuddled up with you... It\u2019s all good. Alea, this wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut when we get home, and we will get home, I intend to find out whose fault it is,\u201d Dane said, sending Cooper a dark look. \u201cSomeone planned this.\u201d</p><p>Someone meant to kill her. Cooper knew exactly what Dane\u2019s expression meant. He was asking Coop to join him in hunting and taking down this fucker. He nodded to Dane. Oh, yeah. They would make sure this asshole couldn\u2019t ever hurt her again.</p><p>\u201cI thought the pilot was just crazy and hated my family.\u201d Alea\u2019s arms slowly wound around his waist. \u201cYou\u2019re both so warm.\u201d</p><p>Cooper cuddled a little closer. \u201cWe\u2019ll always keep you warm, safe...whatever you need. We\u2019ll take care of you. We can survive here indefinitely. Landon is scouting the island for more food right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happens if he doesn\u2019t find any? What happens when the food we took from the plane runs out?\u201d Alea asked, then bit her lip for a moment. \u201cWe got all we could, but we can\u2019t survive on crackers, p\u00e2t\u00e9, and peanuts for very long.\u201d</p><p>Dane chuckled softly. \u201cThere\u2019s an ocean of food right out there. This place has bananas and all kinds of fruit. We were all trained to know what kind of plants we can and can\u2019t eat. Lea, we\u2019ve got this. We survived the crash. That was the hard part. The rest is easy, especially now that you\u2019ve convinced Coop to make sure he doesn\u2019t die of gangrene. I won\u2019t say it will be like hanging around the palace, but if we take care of each other, keep the fire going, find a safe place to wait out any storms that might come, we\u2019ll be golden.\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chest. \u201cI want to help. Just tell me what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dane asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat we need most now is your trust. You have to rely on us. Take this time to get to know us better. Let us have an actual chance to please you and make you happy.\u201d Dane laid a small kiss on her temple.</p><p>She shivered a little, her head coming up off Cooper\u2019s chest. He wished Dane hadn\u2019t pushed yet, but everything his buddy described...yeah, he wanted that, too. \u201cJust a chance, Lea. You don\u2019t hate this, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting used to it,\u201d she admitted, swallowing hard. She was tense, but not rejecting. It was a step. \u201cCan we agree to go slow? I don\u2019t know what I want and I don\u2019t have any idea what I\u2019ll be able to handle. It\u2019s going to take a while to get used to the idea that you guys could actually want me. That someone touching me isn\u2019t doing it to hurt me.\u201d</p> <p>There was a low shout as Landon marched through the foliage and back into camp. He was carrying Alea\u2019s mesh laundry bag, which he\u2019d appropriated earlier when he\u2019d left on his quest to gather coconuts. But it was dripping wet.</p><p>\u201cHey, I found a bunch of conches!\u201d Lan held up the bag and looked at it proudly. \u201cThat\u2019s some good eating and\u2014holy shit.\u201d</p><p>Lan had obviously caught sight of Alea\u2019s half-naked state because it put a truly sizzling stare on his face. Then he lost his usual athletic grace as he walked closer, jaw hanging around his knees, stumbling over the log he\u2019d dragged into camp earlier. He tripped in an epic pratfall. That would make some popular shit on YouTube.</p><p>Alea broke free and started running for Landon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay!\u201d Lan shouted, but Alea was right there, crouching beside him, and there was no mistaking the way Lan took advantage to stare right at her boobs.</p><p>Dane slapped Coop on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s shore up for the night. We\u2019re all tired. We can cook up those conches and talk about making base camp more comfy. Tomorrow we put our plan into action. It\u2019s time to claim our girl.\u201d</p><p>Coop nodded. \u201cAmen, brother.\u201d</p><p>Dane strode over to give Landon a hand with the conches, whistling as he walked.</p><p>It was the happiest he\u2019d seen Dane in a long time. As Alea turned to glance at him over her shoulder and shot a smile his way, he had to admit, it might be the happiest any of them had been in a good, long while.</p><p>Alea shivered a little and wished that her clothes had dried during dinner. But they hadn\u2019t yet. The fire Dane had built was roaring, but she still trembled. Even so, the stars awed her. They wove a brilliant canvas across the dark sky. She\u2019d never seen so many twinkling so brightly.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, huh?\u201d Lan sat beside her, his shoulders rubbing against hers.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone. She might be on one of the remotest islands in the world, but these three men had gone out of their way to show her that everything would be all right.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d The fire crackled in front of her. Cooper and Dane were talking quietly on the other side of the fire pit they\u2019d dug. \u201cDo you think someone will find us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d There was no hesitation in his voice. \u201cI think your cousins will move heaven and earth. But it\u2019s a damn big ocean, Lea. It could take some time. Be prepared to settle in and get comfortable waiting.\u201d</p><p>Her cousins. They would be worried by now. She\u2019d intended to text...and now that wasn\u2019t possible. They would know the plane hadn\u2019t landed in Sydney. Piper would be so worried. They would be forced to call all of Dane, Cooper, and Landon\u2019s relatives to tell them their sons were missing. She knew Dane had a father he didn\u2019t talk to anymore. Cooper had a big family scattered all over southern Colorado. What about Landon? \u201cIs there anyone back in the States who\u2019s going to be upset? You have to know Talib is going to call your parents.\u201d</p><p>Lan turned to the fire. \u201cDon\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>His parents were gone? \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>A bitter smile crossed his face. \u201cDon\u2019t be. They aren\u2019t dead, darlin\u2019. At least I don\u2019t think they are. I don\u2019t know. My mom ditched me about five minutes after I was born. As for my dad, I don\u2019t even know who he is. I\u2019m not even sure my mom did. She got around.\u201d</p><p>She knew he came from a small Texas town. How hard had it been to be abandoned by the woman who should have loved him above all others? \u201cHow old was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was all of seventeen when she had me. The way my grandma told it, she tried really hard to get rid of me, but I was dug into that womb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of you?\u201d</p><p>Lan turned to her, his face a careful blank. \u201cShe tried a homemade abortion. I wasn\u2019t part of her plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lan.\u201d She reached for him, feeling sick, and yet an urge to comfort him all at once.</p><p>Then she stopped her hand in midair as she realized that she\u2019d been about to hug him. The sympathetic gesture had come almost instinctively.</p><p>Lan turned back to the fire as though he couldn\u2019t stand to watch her choose to not touch him. Like other women in his life had rejected him. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. My grandma raised me. We didn\u2019t have much, but she made sure I got fed and had clothes.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said absolutely nothing about anyone loving him. \u201cDo you miss her? Is that who Tal will call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe died a couple years back. She wouldn\u2019t have really cared. She was a mean old lady. There was a reason my momma wanted to get the hell out of that trailer. My grandma ran off everyone who ever loved her. She never let a day go by where she didn\u2019t tell me what a whore my momma turned out to be and that I was an embarrassment. She kept me because righteous women take care of their mistakes.\u201d</p><p>How hard had it been for his sole guardian to consider him a burden? Lan was so competent. In the course of one day, he\u2019d scouted the perimeter of the island, found food, and set up a desalinization station that was gathering water so they could stock up. He was amazing and he\u2019d always been so deeply kind. She didn\u2019t stop this time. If nothing else, he was her friend.</p><p>Alea scooted closer to him and placed a hand on his back, leaning her face against his strong upper arm. His skin was warm and smooth, so much softer than she\u2019d imagined, though it covered rock-hard muscle. \u201cYou weren\u2019t a mistake. I can\u2019t imagine any mother not being so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>He turned slightly, forcing her head up and looking on her with a curious gaze. Slowly, he reached down and brushed away tears she hadn\u2019t known she was shedding. \u201cAre those for me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, then nodded. He wrapped a bulky arm around her and hauled her in close. For a moment, she stiffened, then sank against the heat of his body. And the safety. She felt safe with all of them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you cry for me, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes when he called her that she could almost believe it was a term of endearment and not merely a title. \u201cSomeone should. And I\u2019m not really crying for you. It\u2019s not pity. You came from so little and you\u2019ve turned into a wonderful man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes,\u201d he began, staring down at her, \u201cbad things happen to good people, and they still find a way to turn it around. They find a way to be brave. I know you\u2019re brave, too. I want you to kiss me, Lea.\u201d</p><p>So much for his lack of smarts. He was a manipulative bastard. But if she wanted to heal, wanted to move forward and not let the kidnappers beat her, as Piper had pointed out, she had to be willing to take chances. Get out of her comfort zone. Try to be a whole woman. Believe that she could trust them.</p><p>Alea closed her eyes and tilted her head up. She could handle this. Landon would never hurt her.</p><p>She waited, but nothing happened.</p><p>Alea opened her eyes, and found Lan staring down at her. Cooper had moved behind, and she could feel his heat. Dane had edged closer, too. His gaze was fixed on her, smoldering like the nearby fire, as he leaned back against a tree.</p><p>\u201cHe said he wanted you to kiss him, baby,\u201d Dane pointed out. \u201cYou have to listen to instructions or there might be consequences.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened a little. \u201cI don\u2019t think I like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>Cooper leaned in. \u201cCome on, Lea. Don\u2019t be scared. You know Dane likes to play. It\u2019s just who he is. He needs to feel like he\u2019s in control.\u201d His voice dropped to a whisper. \u201cIf he thinks you\u2019re afraid, he\u2019ll pull away. His ex-wife told him he was a pervert, and I don\u2019t think he can handle it if you feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>Talib liked to \u201cplay,\u201d too. Oh, her cousins had tried to hide that fact from her, but she\u2019d snuck into Tal\u2019s \u201cdungeon\u201d when she was a teenager. The locked door had always intrigued her, and they\u2019d never let her in or explained. Unfortunately when she\u2019d finally figured out how to sneak in, Tal had been playing at the time. She\u2019d hidden, of course, but she\u2019d heard the moans, the slaps of leather on skin, the gasps\u2014the sounds of satisfaction.</p><p>And she\u2019d heard the tenderness he\u2019d shown his submissive afterward. The praise he\u2019d given her. The woman\u2019s sighs of contentment. They had both enjoyed themselves. There hadn\u2019t been anything wrong with it. She\u2019d heard that the dungeon was open again and her cousins played with Piper, teasing her and loving her. Tal needed the control after what had happened to him.</p><p>What had happened to Dane? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sat up and stared at him, illuminated by the fire. He had a bland, somewhat expectant look on his face, but she was starting to really know him. His anxiety revealed itself in the hard line of his shoulders, in the stiff way he held himself. \u201cWhat if I\u2019m not submissive?\u201d</p><p>And just like that, his body relaxed, and the teasing Dom was back. \u201cOh, you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to be in control. Maybe I need it after what happened to me.\u201d How would he handle that?</p><p>A smile softened his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be in control. That\u2019s the great misunderstanding about the lifestyle. The submissive can stop the scene at any time. Any play is meant for your pleasure. Any rule is meant to protect you, build trust between us, and lift you up. It\u2019s why I won\u2019t listen to you talk badly about yourself. I\u2019m willing to spank you over that so you\u2019ll remember. Even if you hate me, I need you to believe how amazing you are.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t necessarily understand, but she was pretty sure she couldn\u2019t hate him. Ever. \u201cWe have to go slow with the whole play thing, Dane. I might never be able to handle it, especially the bondage. Being unable to move...it scares me.\u201d</p><p>Which meant she might never be able to please him.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s going to be okay. We\u2019ll go as slow as you need,\u201d Dane assured her. \u201cTrust isn\u2019t an overnight process. We\u2019ll take it one baby step at a time, if that\u2019s how it\u2019s got to be. For now, I want you to kiss Lan slow and deep. He\u2019s going to sit back and let you have your way with him.\u201d</p><p>Lan smiled at her, placing his hands behind him and using them for leverage as he tilted back. The move left his big chest on display. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my hands to myself, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She rose to her knees. Her having control while she had her way with Lan confused her. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound terribly submissive, Dane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are as many ways to play as there are players,\u201d Dane shot back. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to follow any rules except our own. Now kiss him. I want to watch.\u201d</p><p>The idea of Dane watching her as she kissed Landon made her heart pound in a sultry rhythm. She\u2019d been kissed before by men, yes. But she\u2019d never been the aggressor.</p><p>Men? Hah. She\u2019d dated boys. Not a single one of her few boyfriends had been as masculine as Landon or Cooper or, oh god, Dane. They were big and broad and hard. They oozed testosterone. They had protected her today. They had made sure she was comfortable and safe and warm. They always would.</p><p>No, she\u2019d never dated even one man before. Those rich boys had been cultured, some even really intelligent and interesting. And she would bet they would have panicked and screamed like girls the second they realized the plane was going down. They wouldn\u2019t have put that much time, energy, or thought into making sure she lived. Hell, Coop had all but volunteered to commit suicide by palm tree just to put the plane down in a visible location that might give the rest of them a better chance at being rescued.</p><p>And Landon... She stared up at his stony face, his gorgeous, sculpted mouth. His lips were thick and perfectly curved. His cheeks already had a sexy growth of beard. And his blue eyes were so hopeful.</p><p>Kiss him. She wanted to. She could even feel blood rushing to her nipples as she thought about it.</p> <p>With a little smile, she leaned in and brushed her lips against his, getting just a hint of his warmth and the firmness of his lips before she pulled away.</p><p>She\u2019d done it! She\u2019d kissed him. And she wasn\u2019t stressed or traumatized. He hadn\u2019t pounced on her or...</p><p>\u201cYou can do better than that, Princess,\u201d Lan challenged.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you aren\u2019t going to make him crazy with that little kiss.\u201d Cooper was watching, too, over her shoulder. He\u2019d gotten to his knees behind her. She could feel him almost touching her. What would it be like to have his hands on her hips? Or her breasts, teasing her nipples as she kissed Lan?</p><p>Her whole body flushed with heat at the thought.</p><p>Alea leaned toward Lan again, determined to make him\u2014and the others\u2014a little crazy. She could do it. She\u2019d survived a damn plane crash. She could survive being touched and touching in return.</p><p>Lan\u2019s eyes drifted down to her breasts. He liked them. There was no mistaking the way his cock got hard because he was only wearing his boxer briefs and the fire illuminated his thick length. Yeah, she was already getting to him.</p><p>Alea brushed her lips against his again. But this time, instead of backing away, she pressed in, allowing her hands to cup his face. She loved the rough feel of his whiskers against her palm as she inhaled his scent, tested the firm softness of his mouth, acquainted herself with her body being so close to his.</p> <p>This was nice. So nice. She was getting warm and relaxed.</p><p>\u201cUse your tongue, Lea.\u201d Dane\u2019s command guided her from somewhere near the fire.</p><p>Her tongue. Heat surged through her belly...and arrowed lower. No denying that she wanted to know how he tasted.</p><p>Alea ran her tongue across his bottom lip and felt his whole body shiver as his lips parted. Then she curled her tongue around his shyly and drank in his flavor for a heady second. Oh, she felt lightheaded, but as she eased away, she realized that she had power over him. Dane was right. She wasn\u2019t out of control. Quite the opposite.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s my turn,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI want a good-night kiss, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on or he\u2019ll whine all night long,\u201d Lan whispered against her lips.</p><p>Good-night kisses. If she started allowing them, would they want them every night? Would they want more? The thought made her shiver.</p><p>She turned to Cooper. He held himself just a bit apart, giving her space, the same way Lan had. She moved closer to him and cupped his face, too. His hair was so short, but when she ran her hand across it, she was surprised at how soft it felt. She bumped her nose against his before finding his lips.</p><p>As they touched, a little spark sizzled over her lips. As she opened her mouth and his followed suit, their breaths meshed, their tongues tangled. Coop wasn\u2019t quite as good at being passive and patient as Lan. He surged in, wrapping a hand around her shoulder, as he tilted his head and went deeper. Alea stiffened for a moment, then relaxed. A big zing followed. He was potent. And she couldn\u2019t deny that it was nice to be close to them.</p><p>She sucked his bottom lip into her mouth and loved the groan that came from deep in his chest. Then she nipped at him again before pulling away with a teasing grin.</p><p>Alea stood up, perfectly satisfied with this little experiment so far. But she had one more man to go. Dane.</p><p>Gulping down nerves, she walked to the fire, her feet sinking deliciously into the sand. It was funny how much more aware she was of everything now. The night suddenly wasn\u2019t cold, but rasped a nice cool breeze over her skin.</p><p>Dane watched her, his gaze warm as she halted beside him. \u201cIs it my turn, baby?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, putting a hand on his chest. He was perfectly ripped, every muscle gloriously hard. His face had no give. And somehow, without a word, he demanded that she try her best, give as much as she could. For some reason, she found herself wanting to please him.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d He spread his arms wide, giving her full access.</p><p>Alea had a suspicion that he wouldn\u2019t give her this much leash often. She\u2019d better enjoy exploring and setting the pace while she could.</p><p>Searching up into Dane\u2019s blue eyes and finding a gentle understanding under his hunger, she leaned against him and kissed him, not waiting this time. She drew her tongue along his plump bottom lip, and he remained still beneath her, letting her control everything. How far would he allow her to go?</p><p>She pressed harder, but his lips stayed closed.</p><p>\u201cOpen your mouth,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He obliged when she kissed him again, giving her access. She hoped she was doing it right. She rubbed her tongue against his, curling and sliding. He played along, but he was largely still beneath her.</p><p>Alea stopped and backed away.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Princess?\u201d Dane asked.</p><p>\u201cI want you to kiss me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI moved with you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>But he had. Yes, it was reassuring to have all the control, but she wanted him to respond. She wanted him to truly want her and to prove it in his kiss. Even twenty-four hours ago, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to imagine needing him to kiss her. Now she ached for what he held just beyond her reach.</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, I think I\u2019d like it more if you kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want me to kiss you?\u201d Dane asked. \u201cBecause I won\u2019t keep my hands off you. I\u2019ll take control. Just a kiss, Lea. It won\u2019t go any further than that. I\u2019ll kiss you and hold you. And then we\u2019ll go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He was baiting a trap. She sensed that he\u2019d push a bit beyond that...but she was alive after a harrowing day. And she realized that for the first time since Cole Lennox had pulled her out of that brothel, she wasn\u2019t terrified. Somehow, kissing them made her feel like she was taking control of her life again. Doing what she wanted, not what fear allowed her. No way would she stop Dane now. She wanted to know what it would be like to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>He sat in the sand and leaned against the tree, then patted his lap. \u201cSit here.\u201d</p><p>If she did, so much of her would have to touch so much of him. He\u2019d maneuver them into a position that ensured he was in control. But she knew Dane would honor his promise. Just a kiss.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Lea,\u201d he said, that hard tone to his voice disappearing. \u201cLet\u2019s just get some rest. You sleep between Cooper and Lan. They\u2019ll keep you warm.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been such a coward and she was through with it. They had been nothing but kind to her. She didn\u2019t have to be afraid of them. They were all alone on an island. No pressures, no reporters, no threats. Right now, they didn\u2019t know everything in her past. Maybe they never would. This was her clean slate.</p><p>Someone would eventually rescue them, but maybe she could take this time and enjoy it. She could be their Lea just for a little while.</p><p>She scooted on to his lap and felt his erection right against her hip. Dane Mitchell wanted her. That was all that mattered tonight.</p><p>Dane\u2019s expression changed, turning hard and dominant. He reached up and touched her face, brushing across it with his fingertips as though trying to memorize the feel of her skin. Alea had to swallow down a gasp as his hand trailed down her neck to her chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to touch your nipples.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and felt them tighten before his fingers even got close. They strained against the cotton of her bra, trying to meet him halfway. While his right hand traced the hard points and a soft sigh escaped her, his left wound around her waist, clutching her hip.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t freaking out because this was Dane, the man who had risked his own life to save hers.</p><p>He cupped the nape of her neck, pulling her forward. \u201cPut your hands on me, Lea.\u201d</p><p>There was something about his deep, rich voice that had her fingers moving to his chest and stroking him. She rubbed her palms over his muscled shoulders as he brought her closer and pressed his lips to hers.</p><p>His hand slowly fisted in her hair, every movement precise and slow. She wasn\u2019t startled. Once she reminded herself that he wouldn\u2019t hurt her, she let go of the fear. Then he was drugging her with long, slow kisses, leading her closer and deeper. God, he smelled like a man, musky, potent. She couldn\u2019t stop herself from melting.</p><p>When his tongue licked along the bottom of her lip and she opened for him, he invaded, sliding against her. Over and over, he dipped inside her mouth, taking possession, as his fingers toyed with her nipples. Heat pooled low in her gut. She gave herself over to the moment, moaning softly, arching her breast into his hand.</p><p>Then suddenly, Dane leaned away. He dropped one last, chaste kiss on her lips. \u201cTime for bed, Princess. Lay down on your belly, and let Lan and Cooper touch you for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It was over? And she was supposed to do what?</p><p>Dane moved, shifting her off his lap and standing up. He held a hand out to help her up. \u201cIt\u2019s part of your training. Or rather it\u2019s part of your retraining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being trained?\u201d She was a little unsteady on her feet as Dane led her back to Lan and Cooper.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re being trained to accept love and affection. Lay down. They\u2019re not going to do anything except stroke and rub you until you relax.\u201d</p><p>Landon and Cooper had made a place for her between them. She was the only one with a \u201cbed.\u201d They had saved the cushions from the plane and laid them out so she would be comfortable. They would sleep on the sand. She had argued with them, but to no avail. They wanted to know she was comfortable.</p><p>And now they wanted to touch her. To retrain her. To teach her to accept their hands on her body.</p><p>Alea settled down, aching to be with these brave, honorable, sexy men, too. She wanted to leave her fears behind and just give herself over to these men she was falling for. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cooper took a foot in his hand, cradling it in his own, warming her. \u201cI give a damn fine foot massage.\u201d</p><p>He started to rub, and Alea couldn\u2019t stop the groan that came from her throat.</p><p>Landon\u2019s fingers found her scalp and started to rub. \u201cGo on and get some sleep, baby. We\u2019ll protect you all night long.\u201d</p><p>Her body relaxed, and Alea gave over to the heavenly contentment, reveling in the fact that she didn\u2019t feel a bit of fear.</p> <p>Her last thought as she closed her eyes and drifted away was a sweet one. She\u2019d held the title of \u2018princess\u2019 for years, but this was the first time she\u2019d really felt like one.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Four days later, Alea watched Landon emerge from the jungle with a huge branch of green bananas slung over his rippling shoulder and realized she was in lust.</p><p>The guys kissed, cuddled, and touched her at every turn. They murmured endearments in her ear. They whispered enticements against her lips. Every night, they stroked her and curled protectively around her until she went to sleep. It was like a fantasy.</p><p>And they were slowly killing her. Death by sexual frustration.</p> <p>She often awakened with one\u2019s hand cradling a breast as he buried his face in her neck. Another would have his hand cupping her mound as he pressed his hard cock against her backside. But no one fondled her long enough to release the orgasm now constantly bubbling inside her. They\u2019d primed her body repeatedly, and she felt ready to explode. Just being near them\u2014even looking at them\u2014aroused her. Yes, she\u2019d made them promise to take it slow. But \u201cslow\u201d had become its own form of torture.</p><p>Alea sighed, watching the way Lan\u2019s body moved. He was all strength and masculine grace, from his bulky shoulders to those legs that had been chiseled by hard work and pure grit. His hair was growing out already, though he took care of his beard every day during what she now called \u201cHot Guy Beach Bathing.\u201d</p><p>All three of them would get in the shallows and wash themselves, their strong hands coasting all over those muscles with the soap they\u2019d made here on the island by straining boiling water through ashes and collecting the lye, then mixing it with the melted fat from a pig Lan had caught. They\u2019d tossed in a collection of clean-scented herbs from the island, and it wasn\u2019t bad. In fact, the process had fascinated her, but not as much as watching them shave themselves and shove each other around in the surf. For some reason, men seemed to show their affection for each other with curses and punches.</p><p>But they showed their affection for her with toe-curling kisses and slow strokes of their hands. She was so ready to show them her affection in return.</p><p>\u201cHey, darlin\u2019,\u201d Lan said with a big grin as he entered camp. \u201cYou won\u2019t believe what I found.\u201d</p><p>Bananas, obviously. Alea had no trouble believing he\u2019d found those. Lan had become the provider. He\u2019d managed to fashion a spear from bamboo and his wicked hunting knife. Besides yesterday\u2019s wild pig, he brought home bags full of fish every day.</p> <p>Part of the pig was now roasting over the fire. It was going to be a nice dinner. She\u2019d already gathered wild tubers to cook, too. Food was not a problem here with these men around.</p><p>Sex was, though. Or the frustrating lack of it.</p><p>God, she wanted them.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Alea?\u201d Lan shoved the bananas into the small storage shed Dane and Cooper had built.</p><p>They were rapidly turning into the Swiss Family Robinson. Dane, it turned out, had a true talent for tropical architecture. He\u2019d built a little shelter with a bamboo floor and a roof made of palm fronds he\u2019d woven tightly together, then secured to hold against the wind. It was the rainy season in this part of the world, and Dane had known it. He\u2019d made certain she stayed safe and dry. Now, he was busy building a smoker since a small population of wild boars inhabited the island and her men seemed eager to put as many as possible in their bellies.</p><p>\u201cSorry. My mind is drifting,\u201d she confessed. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cCan\u2019t tell you. You just have to see it. Come on. Cooper is waiting there.\u201d</p><p>She looked out at the beach where Dane was busy gathering rocks and shells for his SOS message. Four days, and they hadn\u2019t seen a single contrail stream from a plane. Alea knew that should probably worry her...but right now being here with them was like the best vacation ever. No outside pressures. No worries. No expectations. They had plenty of food and water, a great shelter, and each other. She was seriously beginning to question what more she needed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go tell him where we\u2019re going. Hang tight.\u201d Landon jogged out to Dane.</p><p>He\u2019d taken to just wearing his boxers and his sneakers. It was too hot during the day to wear much else. Alea had gotten used to just wearing her bathing suit or panties and a bra. She wasn\u2019t embarrassed anymore. The whole experience had been oddly freeing.</p><p>Lan clapped Dane on the shoulder with a nod, then ran back up the beach. He reached for her hand. \u201cHe\u2019s going to join us when he\u2019s done. Come on, darlin\u2019. We\u2019ve been working our asses off. It\u2019s time to take an afternoon for some fun.\u201d</p><p>She followed him into the jungle, the sun disappearing under the heavy foliage. The men had been exploring and only yesterday had declared it safe enough for her to walk around. Even so, she hadn\u2019t been allowed to leave the beach alone. Now, she turned her face up and was mesmerized by the way the beams of sun streamed in. It was a gorgeous matrix of dewy light and green canopy. She could hear monkeys rustling and sending out calls to each other. The jungle was alive. Everything here seemed magical.</p><p>Her first night on the island, the sounds had been terribly familiar, and she\u2019d dreamed she was back in Colombia. When she\u2019d awakened, sweating and shaking, she\u2019d been surrounded by her three men, all eager to soothe and reassure. To protect. And they had, every minute of every hour since.</p><p>They\u2019d put her at ease, and now she saw the jungle like a playground. She was Eve with three glorious Adams.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to love this,\u201d Lan assured. \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time mapping the perimeters. This is the first time I\u2019ve gotten to the center.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d also made a sort of trail. Alea noticed he\u2019d cut back the foliage so she could move easily.</p><p>Up ahead she heard splashing. The island must be much smaller than she\u2019d thought. \u201cIs the ocean close?\u201d</p><p>Lan shook his head, a huge grin on his face. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a lagoon. Cooper says this whole island must be a volcano, so I assumed the pond we found would be heated by the lava underneath. Except I can\u2019t remember the right word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagma?\u201d she supplied.</p><p>His face fell a little. \u201cYeah, that was it. I\u2019m not great with information like that.\u201d</p><p>She pulled on his hand, forcing him to stop and face her. \u201cI should get to spank you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He glowered at her. His blue eyes had turned serious in a heartbeat.</p><p>Just like her, gorgeous Lan had his own insecurities to work through. In the last few days, she\u2019d seen that they all had their own demons. Knowing that made it so much easier to relax and be herself around them. \u201cI want you to stop telling yourself that you\u2019re dumb.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cLea, I\u2019m pathetic if I can\u2019t be honest with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way I\u2019ve always been \u2018honest\u2019 about my fat ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s just gorgeous, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think you\u2019re smart.\u201d She went up on her toes, pressing a quick kiss to his lips. \u201cBut you need retraining, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon... I\u2019m not as smart as Cooper and Dane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crap. You may not have read as much, but you can fix that over time. Just don\u2019t say you\u2019re not smart. In fact, I happen to know you can be a manipulative bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You think so?\u201d A smile broke out on his ridiculously handsome face.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She ran a hand across his chiseled cheek. It was so much easier to touch them now.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll try not to talk about it again.\u201d He leaned over and kissed her swiftly before they started back through the foliage.</p><p>And then Alea saw the reason he\u2019d made her trek through the jungle. Before her was a gorgeous pool of clear water. Cooper stood on a rock fifteen feet above the water, not wearing a single stitch of clothing. He put his hands over his head, every gorgeous muscle in his body on display. He was a thing of beauty. His cock hung out, long and thick even relaxed, his testicles heavy.</p><p>From where she stood, Alea watched as he executed a perfect dive and disappeared beneath the blue surface with a splash.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll love it, darlin\u2019. The water\u2019s fresh and so warm.\u201d Landon toed out of his sneakers and scrambled up toward the rock from which Cooper had dived. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s have some fun.\u201d</p><p>She watched as he shoved off his boxers and dived in.</p><p>As Lan surfaced, she looked around in awe. This was paradise. Beams of golden sunlight shone down on the crystal water. Black volcanic rock formed the edges of the pool, but the water looked inviting and deep. A soft bed of grass surrounded the lagoon, and flowers made a colorful landscape just beyond. This little nugget of paradise was utterly perfect.</p><p>Cooper surfaced, his big hand slicking back his dark hair. He let out a long, joyful howl. Alea laughed. Despite everything they had been through, Cooper had kept a smile on his face. It made frowning in his presence damn hard.</p><p>In fact, everything was different here. She was different. Relaxed and positive. Happy. And she was ready to shed fear and embrace change.</p><p>Her hands went to the back of her bra. Was she really about to bare herself, cast caution aside and see where the moment led? Yes. Her fingers shook, but she managed to unhook the clasp.</p><p>Lan sprang up from the water next to Coop. They were waiting for her patiently. But her patience was at an end. She wanted them. But more, she was coming to need them. They\u2019d taught her to be this Alea she\u2019d discovered on the island. This woman cooked, cleaned, and did laundry. She had purpose. This Alea had shed her past here and now refused to let the past rule her life anymore. This Alea knew what she wanted.</p><p>Her men.</p><p>This island was her haven. Being here with Lan, Dane, and Coop had opened her soul. With a deep breath, she pulled her bra off.</p><p>A big smile broke across Landon\u2019s face. \u201cYou coming in, darlin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoin us, Lea!\u201d Cooper shouted.</p><p>She let her bra drop, and as quickly as she could, she shoved her panties down her hips, then off her legs. God, she was naked. She was completely naked. Alea shivered but not in fear.</p><p>\u201cHey now, gorgeous.\u201d Cooper made his way to the side of the pool with a leer and pulled himself up to reveal his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn beautiful sight.\u201d</p><p>Landon edged toward her, too, with a hot stare. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d Then he frowned. \u201cSorry. I lose my head when I see something that beautiful.\u201d</p><p>They genuinely thought she was beautiful? They\u2019d spent days telling her so. They\u2019d shown her with their hands and their kisses. They seemed determined to make her believe she was gorgeous. It wasn\u2019t easy after her captors had told her repeatedly how ugly she was and how little she was worth. But those pigs had been criminals, horrible human beings. Dane, Cooper, and Landon were heroes. Why should she listen to assholes more than true men?</p><p>That rationale made logical sense, but sometimes emotions\u2014fears\u2014weren\u2019t logical at all. She was realizing that it was going to take time and patience to break through those barriers.</p><p>She forced her hands to her sides and walked to the edge of the pool. Without clothes\u2014even the little bit she\u2019d been wearing\u2014made her feel so naked. She was more aware of the air on her skin, the cool grass at her feet, the perfume of the flowers, of just how alive she could be.</p><p>All she had to do to let herself truly be a part of everything was take one simple step.</p><p>Alea closed her eyes and turned her face up to the sun, letting it warm her skin. Then she stepped off into the void.</p><p>Water enveloped her, surrounding her utterly in warmth. She opened her eyes, shocked that she could see everything in the crystal water. Life surrounded her. Fish swam all over the pond, both alone and in small schools. A turtle with its eyes open observed the humans as it swam by. Alea watched, drinking in the sight of nature teeming. That was what she wanted\u2014to be wide awake and alive. Unafraid.</p><p>With a smile, she broke the surface, and tropical air caressed her skin. She smoothed her hair back and sank into the moment. She\u2019d been missing this, a deep awareness of every moment. Life would always be filled with hope and sorrow, thrill and pain, fear and bliss. And love. It was impossible to truly understand love without knowing those other emotions, without enduring loss. Everything seemed so clear now.</p><p>As she\u2019d grown up, she\u2019d been focused on the future. Since Colombia, she\u2019d almost drowned in the fear and self-pity of her past. She\u2019d damn near let it kill her. Now, she wanted to be in this moment, to forget yesterday and tomorrow, just live for now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Landon and Cooper both dove under the surface, making their way to her. She knew exactly where they were headed and smiled. They wouldn\u2019t leave her alone. Never.</p><p>Then one of them wrapped a hand around her ankle. A joyous little scream left her mouth before they pulled her under with them. How long had it been since she\u2019d trusted someone enough to play? To just laugh and be? She kept her eyes open, and Cooper floated in front of her, his mouth looming closer to her own. They kissed in a sweet, if wet tangle of lips while the fish swam around them, and Lan\u2019s arms circled her from behind.</p><p>They let her go and bobbed to the surface. Landon smiled as he waded around her. \u201cHey, I want one, too.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. She had to treat them all equally or jealousies arose. Her aunt had taught her that. Her aunt had juggled four husbands, and she\u2019d talked to Alea about her marriage in order to prepare her niece for the future. Her aunt had always preached loving all husbands equally because each possessed different traits that completed her. Being the center of her husbands\u2019 world had been an honor and a blessing, according to her. Alea understood now.</p> <p>She put her arms around Lan. How had she ever shunned them? She\u2019d wanted them from the moment they had walked into her life. At one time, she\u2019d been too afraid to take them. Here, fear was no longer a necessity. It wasn\u2019t even an option. Right here and now was heaven.</p><p>His lips parted hers, and Alea allowed his tongue to invade and seduce. He made her melt. Once, she\u2019d been frightened of an embrace that pressed her breasts against his chest. Now she reveled in the sensations, their closeness. He clutched her hard in return. Every day, her men wrapped her up a little bit tighter, a little bit longer. Each moment, each embrace, slowly coaxing her trust.</p><p>When Landon released her, he laughed, the sound deep with joy. \u201cI fucking love it here.\u201d</p><p>Then he disappeared under the surface. Cooper winked at her and disappeared, too.</p><p>And the game was on. She couldn\u2019t help the giggle that bubbled up inside her like champagne. She swam, the water flowing around her, caressing every inch of her skin. She felt in harmony with nature as she played with her men and worshipped the sun that gave life to them all. For the first time in years\u2014maybe ever\u2014she was brilliantly, vibrantly alive.</p> <p>Finally, she made her way to the far end of the pool and pulled herself onto the grass. Smiling in contentment, she lay flat, the air and the sun caressing her skin. She watched birds fly overhead as if they didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d Landon asked, now standing over her.</p><p>Somehow it felt right to be naked here with him, seeing every inch of his body glistening and wet. Alea propped herself up on her elbows. \u201cNo. I feel great.\u201d</p><p>Landon sank to his knees beside her as Cooper continued splashing in the pool. \u201cAre you hungry, darlin\u2019? If you are, I can find you some food. Just give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>He would do it. He would figure out a way to fish without a pole or just catch the little creatures with his hands. Or he would grab the turtles and make soup. Landon always found a way to fill her belly. But that wasn\u2019t what she wanted him to fill right now. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry. Or thirsty, before you ask.\u201d She took in a deep breath, paused...and let the rightness of the moment slide over her. \u201cLandon, I want you.\u201d</p><p>He flushed, his skin going the sweetest pink. His cock immediately stood and saluted. \u201cI want you, too, baby. Are you sure?\u201d</p> <p>Even swimming with them among nature had made her realize how much she longed to do everything that felt natural to her now. \u201cI\u2019m past ready.\u201d</p><p>Landon glanced over his shoulder, looking back to the pond as if looking for Cooper. \u201cUhm, well... This isn\u2019t the way we planned it.\u201d</p><p>Of course they had a plan. But she was tired of following other peoples\u2019 plans. She got to her feet. Lan\u2019s hesitation suddenly made her feel her nudity. They\u2019d spent so much time praising her beauty and telling her that they wanted her. Why was Lan hesitating now?</p><p>Those nasty voices from her nightmare in Colombia started circling in her head again, vultures eager to gnaw on her confidence. Still, she refused to jump to conclusions. Maybe Lan hesitated because Dane hadn\u2019t arrived yet?</p><p>\u201cWhy does this have to be planned? I want to be spontaneous. I want to enjoy being with you\u201d</p><p>Lan sighed and looked up, like he was trying to gather his thoughts or his patience. \u201cAre you really sure? I think we should talk about this.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought they would just fall on her the minute she said yes, that sex would be easy. Alea had mentally prepared herself not to freak out if she found herself underneath one of their big, hard bodies. They claimed to want her. They were together in paradise. So what was the problem?</p><p>At times, she\u2019d behaved wretchedly to them. And they\u2019d been so patient. She would bet these men didn\u2019t take crap off anyone, but they\u2019d taken it from her. They claimed to be crazy about her, and she\u2019d begun to believe it, but...Landon wasn\u2019t exactly jumping on her offer.</p> <p>Alea wrapped her arms around her middle. \u201cWhat is there to say?\u201d</p><p>Lan hesitated, like he had something to confess that he\u2019d rather keep to himself. Her heart twisted. Maybe it had nothing to do with a lack of desire for her.</p><p>But what else could it be?</p><p>She turned away to find the bra and panties she\u2019d discarded earlier when she\u2019d been sure this afternoon would be idyllic and perfect. \u201cNever mind. Forget I said anything. I\u2019ll find my way back to the beach.\u201d</p><p>Landon grabbed her arm, and when she flinched and jerked away, he held up his hands. \u201cAlea...\u201d</p><p>She needed to get her clothes on and she needed to do it now. But Landon had scooped them up first and was holding them to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI need my clothes, Landon. Could I have them, please?\u201d She was fighting off that horrible panic that came from knowing just how foolish she looked.</p><p>Cooper surfaced in the pool, his gaze bouncing between her and Lan. \u201cLea? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She took a deep breath as the truth of that statement hit her. There was nothing going on at all. It appeared that nothing ever would. And she\u2019d made a mistake hoping otherwise.</p><p>\u201cDude, what the hell happened?\u201d Cooper barked as he climbed out of the pool and stood expectantly.</p><p>If anyone had told Lan years back that he\u2019d be comfortable standing naked with other naked dudes, he would have told them they were crazy, but there wasn\u2019t a whole bunch of privacy in the Army. And nudity was even easier here in paradise. He\u2019d become pretty comfortable seeing everyone walking around with their junk hanging out.</p><p>\u201cAlea said that she\u2019s ready.\u201d To move forward. To accept them. Thank God.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cAre you shitting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But there are a few problems with that scenario.\u201d</p><p>Coop looked down the empty trail leading from the beach. \u201cBesides...the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I need to tell Alea something, and she didn\u2019t let me get it out before she decided...I don\u2019t know. That she was ugly or I didn\u2019t want her or some other bullshit.\u201d</p><p>Lan kept his eyes on Alea. She was so fucking gorgeous. The sun kissed her skin, and he could just about swear she glowed.</p><p>Cooper frowned. \u201cNot want you? Lea, his cock is so hard it\u2019s, like, halfway up his nose. Mine\u2019s not any softer. How can you say that? What are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Okay, halfway up his nose was an exaggeration, but not by much. It sure wanted to crawl toward her and work its way inside her. \u201cOf course I want you.\u201d</p><p>In fact, he really wanted to jump on her and spread her legs and get inside her before she could have a second thought. When she\u2019d said she wanted him, his whole body had flashed hot. All he\u2019d been able to imagine was her naked and under him as he fucked her until they were both sated, spent, and he had emptied everything he had inside her.</p><p>Then the big problem had whacked him in the face with a two-by-four of duh!</p><p>\u201cFine. Tell me what the problem is.\u201d Alea stared at him, arms crossed over those luscious breasts.</p><p>When she turned that arrogant frown on him, he totally understood why Dane wanted to lay her out and smack her ass until she begged for mercy. Then he would let her suck his cock in apology. Lan smiled at the image.</p><p>\u201cI only lost one piece of luggage during my swim from the plane to the shore. I\u2019ve dived out there twenty times looking for it.\u201d He scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cI think the current swept it away.\u201d</p><p>Cooper\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cNo. Tell me you didn\u2019t lose the condoms, man.\u201d</p><p>He should have mentioned it before now. \u201cOur stash of condoms is probably growing algae on the bottom of the sea floor. Darlin\u2019, I have no way to protect you. None of us do.\u201d</p><p>And that didn\u2019t make a damn bit of difference to him. He still wanted her. Actually, the idea of fucking her with no latex between them made him crazy, primal. He could mark her. He could fill her up and know that something of him lingered inside her. He stared at her and his heart stopped a little when the sweetest smile stretched across her face.</p><p>She flushed a pretty pink. A gorgeous light glowed in her eyes. God, he loved her eyes. They were a mystery to him always, but he never loved them more than when he saw them lit as though she had a fire deep inside. It was banked most of the time, but Lan got the feeling that if he could just crack that shell of hers, she could warm them all for a lifetime. \u201cSo you still want me?\u201d</p><p>The question nearly brought him to his knees. \u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>She stepped toward him. \u201cThen don\u2019t go. I still want you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He swallowed, trying to hold it together. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about disease. Not at all. We\u2019ve all had physicals and none of us have touched a woman since we hired on at the palace, but you could get pregnant, Lea. We could try to pull out, but...\u201d This was probably a dumb move, but he wanted her to understand what she meant to him. \u201cWhen the time was right, we were going to ask you to marry us anyway. I have no hesitation making love to you without birth control. I can\u2019t wait for a future with you, if you\u2019ll have us. I would love to look at your rounding belly and feel the life underneath kick my palm. Fuck, I\u2019d love that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her lips parted in surprise. Her eyes softened.</p><p>Cooper scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cWe all feel that way, baby. We\u2019re committed to this, to you.\u201d</p><p>A pink flush crept up her cheeks. \u201cI... That\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>She walked toward Lan then, arms outstretched, and he let himself look at her glorious body. First, the curves of her breasts. A heartbeat later, his gaze dropped to her nipples. So fucking pretty. Her curvy waist. Her oh-so-fuckable hips and that mound he couldn\u2019t stop staring at. Her pussy. He wanted to taste it. Coop had licked at that pussy. He\u2019d rubbed it across his face, and Lan was pretty sure he hadn\u2019t washed his fucking face for days so he could still smell her.</p><p>God, his cock was killing him. His heart ached, too. He started toward her, determined to meet her halfway.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t just sex for you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lan took her in his arms. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI second that.\u201d Cooper kissed her temple and caressed her back.</p><p>Tears spilled down her face as she planted her hands on the sides of his face. \u201cBe sure. I\u2019m trouble. I\u2019m difficult. I don\u2019t want to be, and the three of you make me want to heal and be better. So I need you to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou be sure. If we do this, we don\u2019t know what the future will bring...but we know the possibilities. I\u2019ll never be as smart as Dane and Coop, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d She shook her head, more tears flowing. \u201cYou\u2019re wonderful. The future used to scare me, but not now. I see it with you and me, Dane, and Coop. I don\u2019t care about the condoms. I don\u2019t care about anything right now except you. Kiss me. Love me. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Amazing that he could give her what she needed. A real princess and an illegitimate punk from Texas should have nothing in common, but his heart had damn sure spoken. He needed her, too.</p><p>Lan swooped her against his chest and devoured her lips. With her was where he\u2019d wanted to be for fucking months. Years. All his goddamn life. He hadn\u2019t always known her, but he\u2019d been looking for Alea, for the woman who could make him whole.</p><p>He fastened his hands on her hips, loving the way her velvety skin felt under his fingertips. He gripped her tighter, pulling her into the cradle of his body as he eased her lips open under his and his tongue invaded. She\u2019d given him permission. She didn\u2019t care about condoms? Fuck. He could fill her up about a hundred times over. Everything he had belonged to her, especially his heart.</p><p>As his hands caressed their way down, he cupped that gloriously juicy ass. It was so fucking sexy. When she\u2019d turned earlier and flashed those cheeks to him, he\u2019d thought he might die. Again, he slanted his mouth over hers, going as deep as he could. This was heaven. His cock was nestled against her belly, the heat of her threatening to make him blow before his time, but it wouldn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d just get hard again. She was the one. She made his heart soft. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Alea was goddamn everything to him.</p><p>Along with Dane and Coop, he\u2019d worked for days to make her comfortable with his flesh against hers. Now, he pulled her even closer. She didn\u2019t shrink back. In fact, she melted right into him, and Lan smiled. Her arms wound around his neck and she kissed him back, her tongue tangling with his. So good. So right. His cock pulsed against her belly. He could feel her nipples brushing against his chest.</p><p>He rubbed his tongue against her, showing her what he wanted to do with his cock. In and out. In and out. The way she clung to him, giving him breathy little moans, was so fucking perfect. She pressed those breasts close, and he knew damn well that this was the time. And he was her man.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>That was an easy request. \u201cMore than I want my next breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you, Landon. Be my first. Cooper, will you help us?\u201d Her head turned slightly, looking at his friend.</p><p>\u201cDo I get a turn?\u201d Cooper sounded tight, like he was damn close to the end of his rope.</p><p>A brilliant smile broke across her face. \u201cYes, I want to make love with you, too. We\u2019re going to have to work on your sweet nothings, Coop. I want all my men. But you guys do all the camp work tomorrow because I have a feeling I\u2019m going to be sore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal!\u201d Coop assured.</p><p>Lan laughed. He\u2019d just carry her wherever she needed to go. In fact, he would prefer it that way.</p><p>He bent and thrust his right arm under her knees, hauling her to his chest. He wanted to make love to Lea in the soft grass. He wanted to watch every moment. He wanted to memorize it.</p><p>She wrapped her arm around his shoulders and smiled into his eyes, making him feel like the fucking king of the world. He carried her to the grass. It was buttery soft and would suit his purpose.</p><p>When he set her on her feet, Lan immediately shoved his nose in her hair. She smelled clean and tangy and sweet. Heavenly. Like the home he\u2019d been looking for all of his life. She might wake up someday and decide that he was all wrong for her, and he would need these memories to get him through the next fifty years or so. But right now, she wanted him and was embracing the idea of their tomorrows.</p><p>With a coy smile, she wrapped her hands around the sides of his chest. He struggled not to shiver as she caressed her way lower. He kissed her again, then backed off as he felt Cooper moving in behind Alea, his arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cIs this okay?\u201d Cooper asked, pushing her hair to the side so he could kiss her neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful.\u201d One of Alea\u2019s hands trailed back and found Cooper\u2019s hip.</p><p>She was no longer the woman who flinched every time one of them touched her. Landon had started to think that crashing and finding this island was the best thing that could have happened to them. If they had been in Sydney, they would never have made this much progress with her so quickly. Tal and the others would have found her, and she would have had a million and one distractions. Even though she\u2019d meant this trip to be a vacation, she would have had responsibilities and pressure.</p><p>Here, they had nothing to do except focus on each other.</p><p>Lan watched as Cooper turned her head slightly and covered her lips with his own. It was hot to watch his buddy kiss their girl. Cooper\u2019s hands cupped her breasts and offered them up to Lan. Yeah, he would take those. He got to his knees and licked at one nipple. Firm and ripe, he traced the areola with the tip of his tongue. Alea whimpered a little and thrust her breasts out, begging for more.</p><p>A succulent scent wafted up. Her arousal. Sweet and exotically spicy. She wanted him. Them.</p><p>He sucked at her nipples, drawing the first one into his mouth before moving to the second and suckling with abandon.</p><p>He let his fingers drift lower, slipping across her mound and splitting her labia. She was wet, a soft, sweet heat he couldn\u2019t wait to sink into, but he would have to because she wasn\u2019t a quick lay. No. He was going to let her take all the time she needed.</p><p>He bent over and stuck his nose right into her pussy.</p> <p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t she smell good?\u201d Cooper murmured.</p><p>Lan looked up, and Cooper was twisting Alea\u2019s nipples. She was writhing in his hold, but it was a sweet little torture. There was no fear at all in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe smells perfect. I bet she tastes even better.\u201d</p><p>Alea\u2019s hips rolled and a gaspy little moan came out of her mouth. \u201cOh, god. Please. Please touch me, Lan.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think for a second that she wanted him to touch her with his fingers. No way. He ran the flat of his tongue right between her swollen folds, gathering the cream of her arousal. Oh, he\u2019d been so right. She tasted sweet and tangy. He sucked her into his mouth and then licked a line up to her clit. That little pink jewel was pouting and begging for attention.</p><p>\u201cLan, please,\u201d Alea said.</p><p>She\u2019d been interrupted with Cooper and hadn\u2019t gotten to come. In fact, she\u2019d very likely never really orgasmed. She\u2019d known violence, but she didn\u2019t know how much ecstasy another\u2019s touch could bring. Landon intended to show her. It was the most important thing he\u2019d ever done. He leaned in, set his mouth on her again, and focused on showing her pleasure.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Alea\u2019s legs were disintegrating under her as pleasure seeped in and made her boneless. She would have fallen to the ground while Landon feasted on her pussy if not for Cooper wrapping her in his strong arms. Just days ago she would have felt caged and utterly terrified. But he embraced her, rather than trapped her. His touch was filled with affection. Cooper wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>If she needed him to, he would release her instantly.</p><p>But that was the last thing she wanted now. Cooper held her to allow Landon to have his sweet way with her pussy. Alea glanced down her body at his sandy blond head moving between her legs, tilting to get deeper as he licked, sucked, and laved until she felt like she was in a pleasure-induced haze.</p><p>\u201cLay her down,\u201d Landon commanded.</p><p>Cooper positioned her in the grass before she could protest. No! She wasn\u2019t ready for this part to be over yet.</p><p>\u201cSpread those legs, baby,\u201d Cooper whispered into her ear as he sat and cradled her head against his chest. \u201cLan wants more of you. Give him your pussy.\u201d</p><p>Lan didn\u2019t wait for her to comply. He grabbed her ankles and forced her legs wide, then slithered to his belly between them. Alea sighed with relief that he simply wanted her in a different position. The minute she felt his tongue push through her slick, sensitive folds again, she understood why. He speared his tongue inside her, and the velvety hot invasion had her squirming, arching, crying out.</p><p>\u201cBe still, Lea,\u201d Coop warned. \u201cLet him have his way.\u201d</p><p>Cooper squeezed her nipples again, pinching and plucking. A hot flare darted down her body, straight to her clit. She pushed her hips up at Lan.</p><p>Alea couldn\u2019t find the breath to tell Coop that his \u201cpunishment\u201d only aroused her more. They made her feel so alive and aware of her body. With every moment, every intimacy, they pushed her closer to the edge of the cliff. God, she wanted to fall blissfully over it.</p><p>Landon continued to worship her with his tongue, not leaving a single slick inch of her untouched. He held her open while Cooper held her down. And it didn\u2019t frighten her in the least. Alea relaxed because they wouldn\u2019t hurt her. She belonged with these men and she felt that all the way to her soul.</p><p>Alea wriggled to get closer and panted. Desire rushed through her blood, need escalating, coalescing. Her head fell back against Cooper\u2019s chest as his palms cupped her breasts, fingers still plucking and teasing, driving her mad.</p><p>\u201cI think our girl likes having her pussy eaten. Don\u2019t you, baby? You like having a mouth on your cunt. Does it feel good? I can tell you, it tastes so fucking good. You\u2019re the sweetest thing I\u2019ve ever had on my tongue.\u201d</p><p>The blunt words coming out of Cooper\u2019s mouth probably should have shocked her, but it merely sent more desire shivering through her body. Every word he uttered in her ear sounded low, sexy, and seductive.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Tell us you like it. Tell us how much you like having his tongue on your pussy.\u201d He punctuated the command with a sharp pinch to her nipples.</p><p>With a frantic nod, she cried out. \u201cYes! It feels so good.\u201d</p><p>Good? A ridiculous understatement. This was heaven. Lan\u2019s tongue was dedicated and strong, thorough and unerring. He settled his thumb over her clit and rubbed circles that magnified the ache. She couldn\u2019t help arching closer, shoving against him with a moan.</p><p>This time Cooper encouraged her. \u201cOh, you\u2019re close, aren\u2019t you? Ride his tongue. Let him take you all the way, baby. I can\u2019t wait to watch you come.\u201d</p><p>His fingers pulled at her nipples, matching up with the rhythm of Lan\u2019s tongue. Over and over, they sent her higher with a tangle of sharp sensations\u2014the slide of Lan\u2019s tongue as he circled her clit, Cooper pulling on her nipples and whispering filthy hot suggestions. Alea held her breath. Who needed air now with this epic wave of pleasure swelling inside her? She stiffened in anticipation, keening, almost praying to finally feel the release she\u2019d been denied all her life.</p><p>Finally, with another slide of Lan\u2019s tongue, the crest broke through her body. Ecstasy unlike anything she\u2019d ever felt or imagined burned the blood in her veins. She felt dizzy, light, euphoric.</p><p>Oh god! This was the incredible, mind-altering experience other women whispered and moaned about. This was what made Piper smile all day as she hummed through the palace. The amazing burst of need seemed to take her up, send her soaring until she swore she could almost feel heaven. Her heart roared. Her pussy felt electric.</p><p>Alea came down slowly, panting for precious air. An almost divine peace flooded her mind as satisfaction relaxed her body. She let herself sag in Cooper\u2019s arms, knowing she was warm and safe here.</p><p>Lan kissed her pussy one last time, then crawled up her body, planting his lips on hers.</p><p>Now he would take her. Alea swallowed, steeling herself. But she could handle it. He\u2019d proven that he knew how to give nothing but joy and love. If she opened her body to him, it would be all right. She might never enjoy this part, but she would focus on delighting in the pleasure she gave him. Likely, she\u2019d have to remind herself that having a man on top of her wouldn\u2019t be scary or awful. But she wanted to give this to him. She wanted to be completely connected to them all.</p><p>Alea wondered where Dane was. He was supposed to join them. Yes, Coop and Lan made her feel incredible, but she wanted Dane, too. When it came to her men, she suspected she would be greedy.</p><p>Lan\u2019s tongue invaded her mouth with a hard press of his lips and a barely contained breath. She tasted herself on his tongue. The way he shared the flavor of her pleasure with her felt deeply intimate. Alea tangled with him\u2014tongues, fingers, bodies. His cock throbbed against her belly. She might be perfectly happy and sated, but Lan needed more. She wanted to give to him as he\u2019d given to her.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot like this.\u201d Lan brushed her lips one last time, then he spread his big body on the ground beside her, letting his head rest in the soft grass. \u201cI think you should make love to me.\u201d</p><p>Then Cooper was helping her up and taking her place on the plush earth next to Landon. \u201cGo on. We want you to explore.\u201d</p><p>She dragged in a breath as they displayed themselves for her, all rippling muscles, freshly bronzed from the island sun. Landon was lean like a swimmer, his every muscle perfectly chiseled. He had a cut torso that flowed into long, powerful legs. His cock was long and thick, standing out from a nest of blond hair. His eyes could be like ice chips, but now they glowed with a brilliant blue warmth. Cooper was built more like a quarterback, tall and buff, with broad shoulders that went on for days. His brown eyes blazed nearly black, searing her.</p><p>So beautiful and so different. And both hers.</p><p>\u201cGo at your own pace, darlin\u2019. When you\u2019re ready, you take us. Take as long as you want.\u201d Landon offered her his body.</p><p>\u201cBut please say it won\u2019t be too long.\u201d Cooper\u2019s hand was on his cock. A mischievous smirk lit his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve wanted this for so damn long, baby.\u201d</p><p>With an unblinking stare, she watched his hand move up and down. Cooper was thicker than Lan, but not by much. Both men had long, massive cocks. Cooper\u2019s hand roughed up and down his own, from the tip to the base, just above his balls, then back again. It should have been dirty or she should have felt like a voyeur. But no, this sharing felt natural. They didn\u2019t need modesty in paradise. Arbitrary boundaries just closed them off from one another. Here, now, they were connected and complete. Well, almost.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Alea let herself sink to her knees in the velvety grass. They\u2019d left space for her between them, and she took advantage of it. She settled a hand on both of them, reveling in the catch of Lan\u2019s breath and Coop\u2019s groan. She drew her palm up their stomachs slowly, her touch skating up to their muscled chests. They controlled so much strength for her benefit. Both men were deadly, trained to kill, but they used it to protect, not to vanquish or take. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Explore. That was the word Cooper had used. And she did.</p><p>Alea leaned over and kissed Landon\u2019s chest, right above his heart. She let her cheek lie against his skin and she could hear his heart pounding. He wrapped his arms around her, and Alea knew he could have held her tighter, but he merely clasped her lightly so that she could escape if she panicked. A sweet but unnecessary gesture. She nuzzled him instead, gratified to hear him groan as he filtered his fingers through her hair.</p><p>With a bye-for-now kiss, she left Lan and shifted to Cooper, spreading her lips across his chest. As she pressed her cheek to him, Alea listened to the rhythm of his heart for a moment before sitting up again. She wanted to explore them, but more than anything, she wanted to please them.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you like.\u201d Alea rubbed the flat of her palm against their chests, letting her fingers prowl down their ridged abdomens, gratified when Coop sucked in a breath and Lan seemed to get harder.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d Landon croaked.</p><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s you, baby. Touch me. You\u2019ll see the power you have,\u201d Cooper groaned.</p><p>That invitation was too good to pass up. Alea shivered at the thought of holding him in her hand both literally and figuratively. How long would it take to give him the kind of pleasure they\u2019d given her?</p><p>As she reached tentatively for Cooper\u2019s cock, he grabbed her wrist. \u201cGo on. You can be rough with me. Just...please. Goddamn it, touch me.\u201d</p><p>Her breath catching, Alea gripped his erect flesh and gasped. So hard...and yet so buttery soft, like the finest silk. Cooper\u2019s cock twitched in her hand. The head was almost like a purple plum, swollen and blood-filled. She swiped her thumb across it curiously, gratified by his guttural groan of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. Fuck, I want to watch.\u201d Landon turned on his side, propping his head on his hand. \u201cGo on, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d Then she realized that sounded silly and blushed. \u201cSorry. I\u2019ve never touched a cock before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Landon sounded stunned.</p><p>She knew exactly why. \u201cMy captors beat me silly, but they never raped me, Lan. They didn\u2019t actually force me to do anything except watch the horrible things they did to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLea?\u201d There was so much sympathy in his voice, but she understood that it wasn\u2019t pity. He cared about her, loved her. He would empathize. Once she\u2019d realized that, she\u2019d felt more equipped to deal with it. And it felt all right to talk to them about those dark days. She was safe now.</p><p>Cooper clapped a hand over hers, stopping the rhythm of her strokes. \u201cDo you need to talk about it first?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and eased his hand away from hers to resume stroking him. She fell into a sensual, measured rhythm. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not letting those ghosts haunt me anymore. I just want to move past it. I want to be able to be with you all.\u201d</p><p>Lan kissed her shoulder, rubbing his cheek against hers. \u201cWe want to be with you, too, but you have to tell me if something scares you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Cooper practically purred the word. He was all tawny and golden, his eyes intent and filled with delicious need.</p><p>The idea of pleasing them aroused her. Already wet from Lan\u2019s mouth and her orgasm, she felt her folds grow even slicker.</p><p>\u201cAm I doing this right?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Coop just groaned.</p><p>\u201cGrip him harder.\u201d Lan murmured the words against her skin. \u201cHe wants it. Look.\u201d</p><p>A little pearly drop of liquid formed at the slit. Acting purely on instinct, she swiped at it with her thumb and brought it to her mouth. Salty and rich. A little decadent. So very intimate.</p> <p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Cooper moaned and another drop welled.</p><p>Alea hesitated. \u201cWas I not supposed to do that?\u201d</p><p>Lan chuckled. \u201cHe liked it, darlin\u2019. It was sexy as hell. Stroke him good and hard. Keep running your thumb over the top. Soon, he\u2019s going to come all over your hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She blinked down at Coop. \u201cYou want that?\u201d</p><p>He was panting now. \u201cFuck, yes. Please. Damn it...\u201d</p><p>The slit of his dick was already wet again, cream coating the head. Alea touched him there, getting her palm coated in the liquid silk. It was easier to stroke Coop now with the lubrication. He seemed to grow even larger as she increased the friction of her fingers over his flesh. She watched, utterly fascinated, as Cooper closed his eyes in concentration.</p><p>Was he trying to block her out? Thinking of someone sexier? Alea bit her lip, hating the anxiety plaguing her again. They\u2019d done everything to reassure her...but she didn\u2019t know how to curb the terrible insecurity.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to make it last,\u201d Lan explained as if he could read her mind.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard because she feels so good,\u201d Cooper growled as his hips rolled, shoving deeper into her palm. \u201cAnd he\u2019s wrong about why I closed my eyes. Fuck, baby, I\u2019m pretending that you\u2019re riding me. In my head, I can feel you all over my cock. You\u2019re drenching me in your hot cunt and... Damn it.\u201d</p><p>He was panting now, his rough breaths sawing out of his chest like he was at the end of a marathon.</p><p>\u201cFaster,\u201d Lan urged.</p><p>Alea picked up the pace, watching each move his body made, feeling every twitch of his cock. He opened and closed his eyes again as if he was utterly lost in the pleasure. God, he swelled again in her hand. Her shoulder burned with effort, but she pressed on, determined to make every stroke throb against her palm and give him ecstasy.</p><p>Cooper moaned, and she watched as his heavy balls drew up. An agonized groan tore from him as his body jerked, his hips arched. Then pearly fluid spat from the head of his cock, coating her hand as he came with a roar.</p><p>\u201cFuck, baby!\u201d He kept thrusting into her grip.</p><p>The violence of his release calmed. The satisfaction in his moan made her smile gladly, especially when he settled back into the grass, peace settling over his face.</p><p>Lan kissed her shoulder, then fell back to the ground, tugging her around to face him. \u201cDamn, watching that has me hot. Touch me, darlin\u2019. Now.\u201d</p><p>That was a demand she wasn\u2019t about to ignore. Quickly, she leapt to the pool and rinsed her hands, then hustled back to her men, flushing at the way their gazes sizzled her. When she crouched between them again, Alea leaned over Cooper, kissing his mouth in a soft meeting of breaths and lips before turning back to Landon.</p><p>With an expectant stare, he silently urged her closer. Alea smiled. Where to start? She let her fingers trace the sharp line of his jaw and felt those perfectly sculpted lips before she moved to the dimple on his chin. His late-afternoon whiskers tickled the pads of her fingers.</p><p>He grew restless as she explored his shoulders and chest, running her palms all over. Alea watched him fight for patience. He placated himself by fondling her breast, the curve of her waist\u2014and pulling her in for quick, demanding kisses, each more urgent than the last. Lan was slowly unraveling. Alea loved it.</p><p>Drunk on the intimacy, her head still buzzing from her orgasm, she got brave. \u201cTurn over.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow at her, then winked before turning onto his belly, revealing what had to be the most beautiful male backside she\u2019d ever seen. She grinned as she contemplated all the ways she might touch him.</p><p>Alea started by gliding her hand down the long length of his spine. His shoulders clenched. The tendons in his neck stood out. Hmm... So much strength right under her hand. She cupped his ass, then, feeling really daring, she bent and pressed a kiss on one cheek before gently sinking her teeth into the other.</p><p>Cooper, now rolled to his side and watching, laughed. \u201cAre you trying to make him crazy, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe...\u201d Her response was probably rash and a bit reckless. Bringing Cooper to orgasm had reignited her body. Having license to touch Lan wherever and however she wanted had thrown kindling on the flame. Her body sizzled with new arousal. When she\u2019d said yes, she\u2019d thought she would just lie back and let him take her. But she liked being an active participant so much more.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s working.\u201d He sounded strained, then he groaned. \u201cBut it\u2019s the best kind of crazy.\u201d</p><p>She touched him everywhere, reveling in the way his muscles tightened, and he closed his eyes. She loved every groan and gasp that tore from his chest. \u201cTurn over again. I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over on cue, but he had a gleam in his eye. \u201cYou\u2019re in charge today, darlin\u2019, but don\u2019t think this is how it\u2019s always going to be.\u201d</p><p>Because he would want to control the sex eventually. They all would. They were too alpha to let her have the power for long, but today was proof of Lan\u2019s amazing tenderness. He was willing to grit his teeth to be with her however she needed this first time. And she planned to enjoy it.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She leaned over and kissed him, a sweet brushing of their lips.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t enough for him. He sank his hands into her hair, fisting the strands, tilting her head. He might be on the bottom, but he had absolute authority over the kiss. He ran his tongue over her bottom lip, demanding entrance. She let him in and melted against him, chest to chest, belly to belly. Warmth encased her, a blanket of soft skin and his hard will. He wrapped his arms around her and dove deep into her mouth. Alea lost herself to him.</p><p>A low thrum started in her belly, a wanting she couldn\u2019t deny. Her blood pounded through her veins. Her heart punched her chest. She wriggled restlessly, trying to ease the burn gathering heat inside her pussy.</p><p>\u201cYou aching, darlin\u2019? You ready to come again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d Alea didn\u2019t know how it was possible. She\u2019d gone her entire adult life without an orgasm, and suddenly she didn\u2019t think she could wait another five minutes.</p><p>Lan gave her a long, slow grin. \u201cTake me inside you, Lea.\u201d He snatched her from the grass and brought her body over his to straddle his hips. \u201cRide me.\u201d</p><p>Beneath her, his cock was straining. Lan took himself in hand, forcing it upright and placing it against her pussy, the head slipping in. The feel of his hard flesh against her yielding folds was foreign and a little scary. She\u2019d been told that this would hurt. He was obviously big.</p><p>But she\u2019d come too far in life and with her men to be deterred by a little pain or fear.</p><p>\u201cGo slow, baby.\u201d Cooper had gotten to his knees and now sat beside her, reaching for her arm. He steadied her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Just sink onto him. You can take him.\u201d</p><p>Alea followed Coop\u2019s advice, easing the head of Lan\u2019s cock past her folds. She felt herself clench around the intrusion as her body instinctively welcomed him, hugged him.</p><p>\u201cOh, darlin\u2019, you feel so damn good.\u201d He gripped her hips, tightening on her but not forcing her down.</p><p>Inch by unhurried inch, Alea lowered herself. The moment seemed to slow as his cock filled her tight passage. She felt no pain yet, just an amazing fullness.</p><p>Until the head of his cock bumped the barrier of her virginity.</p><p>Lan swallowed, his muscles already trembling with restraint. Sweat beaded on his forehead. \u201cTake it slow.\u201d</p><p>She could, but sort of like removing a bandage, she figured that slow would only prolong whatever pain she felt.</p><p>With one long breath, she closed her eyes, then shoved her hips down, forcing his cock deep.</p><p>Pain flared, sparking between her legs. She gasped in a protesting breath. He was too big, too thick. God! Tears blurred her vision. She was just about to scramble off of Lan, but he held her in place and hauled her forward, bringing her close, soothing her with a touch. Even as he did, he lifted his hips and his cock filled her to the point of bursting.</p><p>Alea cried out. \u201cDon\u2019t. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, darlin\u2019,\u201d Lan soothed. \u201cAm I scaring you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, trying to separate the sensations. \u201cIt hurts. It\u2019s too much. You don\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Give it a minute. Coop, help me out here.\u201d Lan glided comforting palms up her back as he raised his head, brushing her lips with his own. \u201cOpen for me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t give her an opportunity to protest, just took her mouth and drugged her with long, toe-curling kisses. Then Cooper settled behind her, and his hand found its way between their joined bodies. His fingers unerringly settled on her clit, and he traced slow circles over her sensitive flesh. Tingles leapt back to life. A slow ribbon of pleasure unfurled just under her clit. Between Landon\u2019s slow, desperate kisses and the stimulation from Cooper\u2019s touch, she relaxed, sinking deeper until she\u2019d taken his cock inside her all the way to the root.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Cooper praised in a low voice as he pressed kisses along her shoulder and up her neck. \u201cYou\u2019re pussy is so soft, baby. Lan and I can make you feel good. Just close your eyes and let us.\u201d</p><p>Her body came back to life, and Lan\u2019s cock inside her seemed to throb, as if she could feel his very heartbeat. With Cooper at her back, she felt surrounded, treasured. Making love with them both would be like this, their breaths over her skin, both their big male bodies enveloping her in heat and straining to pleasure her. She worried for a moment that accommodating one in her pussy and the other in her ass would be somewhere between agonizing and impossible. But Piper never seemed distressed or frustrated. Her aunt never had either. Alea took another deep breath, giving herself over to Coop and Lan. They would make it work when the time was right. She trusted them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As if trust were the magical key, she was able to unclench on Lan\u2019s cock and ease her body up a fraction. The pain was gone. Only pleasure flared through her as she sank back onto him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, darlin\u2019,\u201d Lan encouraged. \u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so sexy, Lea,\u201d Cooper whispered. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m already hard again.\u201d</p><p>Alea tossed her head back and rocked her hips again with a whimpering moan. Now that the pain was gone, the sensations of Lan inside her weren\u2019t merely okay. They were incredible. The friction of his thick, hard flesh sliding against her nerve endings, scraping gently at the sensitive end of her channel, then dragging pleasure from her as she rose back up... Wow. Lan gripped her and moaned. Coop whispered dirty little encouragements in her ear. It should have overwhelmed her, but no. They made her feel beautiful and free. All her anxiety melted away as she let go of everything except how good they felt. Why had she been so scared of them? They were perfect, and she needed this. She needed them.</p> <p>\u201cTilt your hips, Lea,\u201d Cooper instructed, positioning her just the way he wanted her. \u201cLet his cock drag over the front wall of your cunt.\u201d</p><p>Beneath her, Lan tensed and thrust up, brushing over some insane pleasure button buried deep in her pussy. She nearly screamed out his name.</p><p>\u201cExactly like that, baby.\u201d Cooper let his teeth sink gently into her shoulder as he continued to rub gentle circles around her clit.</p><p>Her pussy was on fire. Orgasm bubbled and brewed, sharper than before. Deeper. She tightened on Lan and wailed, trying to absorb all the ecstasy about to crash over her. So close...</p><p>\u201cYes, Lea, yes.\u201d Lan\u2019s hips thrust up over and over again, a measured, insistent rhythm that got progressively faster.</p> <p>The burn of his friction ignited her pleasure. Orgasm exploded inside her like a bomb, and she screamed, tossing her head back as she dug her nails into his shoulders. Lan\u2019s whole body bucked under her, tensing as he came inside her. She felt the warm flood of his seed jet against her sensitive flesh, making her heart race and her body arch as pleasure rolled over her body once more.</p><p>Finally, their movements and heartbeats slowed. A deep sense of peace filled her as she cuddled against his chest, her ear right over the steady, strong rhythm of his heart. Tears of joy pricked at her eyes. She was almost grateful for them following her on this impromptu trip, for the plane crash. Without those events, she\u2019d still be lost in her darkness, dreadfully unhappy with no idea how to pull herself out of her shell. Being isolated with them in a life-or-death struggle had forced her to examine what was truly important...think about what she genuinely wanted in life. Because the answer was simple.</p><p>Them.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lea,\u201d Lan said, brushing her heavy hair away from her face and looking up at her with a soft smile of adoration.</p><p>Coop leaned around her and curled a finger around her chin, bringing her lips to his. \u201cI do, too, Lea. That was incredible, baby.\u201d</p><p>She let their beautiful words sink into her. For once, she believed them. Happiness was so bright inside her, she must be glowing with it. For this one perfect second, she felt worthy of them all.</p> <p>\u201cWell, this gives a whole new meaning to \u2018showing her the pool.\u2019\u201d Dane\u2019s voice cut through her languor. \u201cLooks to me like you showed her every inch of your dick, too\u2014right up her pussy.\u201d</p><p>Dane. She hadn\u2019t thought about the fact that he wasn\u2019t here while the guys had drowned her in pleasure. But when she looked up, ready to hold out a hand and bring Dane close, the nasty fury on his face and the ice in his blue eyes stopped her cold.</p><p>\u201cDane, come on, man. What is your problem?\u201d Cooper scowled.</p><p>\u201cThat fucker.\u201d He pointed at Lan. \u201cI\u2019m going to rip you limb from limb.\u201d</p><p>Lan sat up and lifted her off his cock, rolling to his feet in front of her as though determined to protect her. \u201cLea, why don\u2019t you get dressed and go back to camp while we talk this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t wear a fucking condom?\u201d Dane\u2019s scream echoed through the trees. Startled birds flew from the treetops. Dane\u2019s face went red. He clenched his fists.</p><p>Alea looked down and saw remnants of his semen and traces of her blood on his cock and her thighs. The sight of it seemed to enrage Dane, and suddenly she thought maybe she should be the one protecting Lan.</p><p>\u201cNo. They were in the pack the current took during my swim to shore, so we don\u2019t have any,\u201d Lan said calmly. \u201cI explained that to Alea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was carrying so much...\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight, Lan. You \u2018lost\u2019 them,\u201d Dane made air quotes, \u201cso that you can knock her up and cut the rest of us out? Or is Cooper in on your plan, too, and I\u2019m the only schmuck still standing here with his dick in his hand?\u201d</p><p>Clearly, she should have waited until Dane was with them, but it had been spontaneous.</p><p>Cooper held up a hand and gave an awkward little smile. \u201cDude, if you\u2019ll ratchet down the drama, we\u2019re all going to get a turn at knocking her up. She knows we want to marry her and have a family. We\u2019re just making sure it will be a shotgun wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your jokes right now, asshole.\u201d Dane glowered, then turned that nasty stare on Lan. \u201cSo when were you going to tell me about this new plan? I\u2019m betting never. Because, oh, you didn\u2019t want the big bad Dom touching your pretty princess and scaring her away, right? That\u2019s why you waited to fuck her until I was busy.\u201d</p><p>Alea flinched at the ugly accusation. \u201cIt just happened. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lan held up his hand to her, and Coop pulled her back with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying to me?\u201d Lan challenged, his voice going low and guttural.</p><p>She was a little surprised they didn\u2019t start beating their chests like aggressive apes. Only minutes ago, she\u2019d felt so languid, sated. Happy. Now all she felt was the weight of the moment. Everything she wanted, everything they all needed could be in jeopardy if she couldn\u2019t pull them together.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you had no fucking right to deviate from the plan.\u201d Dane was a good two inches taller than Lan and he seemed intent on proving it by looming over him. \u201cWe were all supposed to be here with her the first time. But I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. You broke from the plan to bring her to the meeting with the Anders brothers, too. Think you\u2019re the big smart man making all the decisions now?\u201d</p><p>The last of her sated peace dissipated and fury replaced it. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to him like that! I belonged in that meeting, so he took me. I wanted him, and he gave me what I desired.\u201d</p><p>Dane pinned her under an icy stare. He raked that cold gaze up and down her body until she shivered. \u201cI\u2019ll bet he did. Did he fuck you good? Is Coop going to back him up now?\u201d</p><p>God, his snide tone made her feel cheap. She\u2019d wanted to make love, and they had given her a special memory to treasure. She\u2019d felt special. Now, she just felt like a bone the gentle lab and the rabid hound would fight over. And she felt more than vaguely guilty for something that wasn\u2019t her fault.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that!\u201d she insisted, feeling sick to her stomach. \u201cYou\u2019re being a bully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the fuck up, Dane. Are you even thinking about her?\u201d Cooper rose and dove into the fray.</p><p>\u201cAll I\u2019ve done is think about her,\u201d Dane shot back. \u201cI\u2019m the only goddamn one of us who thinks with his head at all. You two have done nothing but think with your dicks since the moment you saw her. You tongue-fucked her in a bathroom and couldn\u2019t get the job done,\u201d he sneered at Cooper, then shifted to Lan. \u201cYou took a virgin and a princess on the ground like any ol\u2019 hook-up because your cock got hard. You were supposed to treat her right, but no. You just chucked her on the ground and sank your cock in, spewing all your swimmers in her unprotected womb. That\u2019s a great first time for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoyed it. It was a great first experience.\u201d Or it had been until Dane had stomped in and made it sound crude with his destructive accusations.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t here, so you don\u2019t know shit.\u201d Landon ignored her, too. \u201cI took care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDane, you need to calm down, brother.\u201d Cooper got in between the other two men, obviously ready to stop them if they threw down.</p><p>Lan took a step away, his gaze tangling with hers and now full of regret. \u201cLea, I\u2019m sorry. Darlin\u2019, let\u2019s wash up. If Dane is determined to fight, he can do it with himself. But he\u2019s right about one thing; I\u2019m not taking care of you the way I should right now.\u201d</p><p>When he tried to lead her away to the pool, Alea dug in her heels. It was obvious Dane had a serious problem with what they\u2019d done. Maybe she hadn\u2019t understood the \u201cplan\u201d well enough. Maybe they should have talked more first. They were damn sure going to talk now. \u201cDane, stop being a hothead. I\u2019ll get dressed, and we can discuss this like rational adults.\u201d</p><p>Dane looked down at her, his eyes cold. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of interrupting your little party. I\u2019ll just take myself off, so you can get back to fucking my friends.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d slapped her across the face, he couldn\u2019t have hurt her more. Shame coursed through her, shoving out all the happiness she\u2019d felt just minutes ago. Then Dane pivoted away and stalked back toward the beach like she didn\u2019t mean a damn thing to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d Landon started to stomp after him.</p><p>Cooper put a hand on his friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou want to go and beat the shit out of Dane with your junk hanging out? Don\u2019t, my brother. Dane fights dirty. He will not have a problem trying to pull your dick off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stay here. I\u2019m going.\u201d She looked around for the nearest garment and found Cooper\u2019s shirt, then dragged it over her head. It wasn\u2019t much but it would cover her long enough to give him a piece of her mind. \u201cI am not letting him get away with that.\u201d</p><p>Dane had talked and talked about taking it slow and easy. He\u2019d assured her that the choice was hers, that when she was ready, they would all be here for her. Yeah. He\u2019d really meant that bullshit.</p><p>\u201cI am glad I\u2019m not the one she\u2019s mad at,\u201d Lan said under his breath.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really pissed off.\u201d Coop sounded proud.</p><p>Furious, actually. She didn\u2019t have a thing to be ashamed of. Dane did. He wasn\u2019t allowed to make her feel like a whore, then walk away. He\u2019d tried so hard to convince her this relationship would work, but the first time he got angry, he pouted and threw a tantrum.</p><p>She took off after Dane, anger thrumming though her veins. She took a deep breath. He wanted a fight? He\u2019d better brace himself for what he\u2019d claimed to want all along\u2014the real Alea al Mussad.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>The minute Dane\u2019s feet hit the beach he knew he should go back and apologize. Hadn\u2019t the fight at the palace and Tal\u2019s dressing down taught him anything? Everyone with a successful plural marriage had told him they had to behave like brothers. Brothers didn\u2019t normally walk away from brothers. Well, his biological ones had, and he\u2019d resented the fuck out of it.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he just done the same to Landon and Cooper? Yes, but they\u2019d taken Alea without him. And he hadn\u2019t really listened to what they\u2019d said. He\u2019d just lost his temper and his fucking mind.</p><p>Now he was arguing with himself. Awesome.</p><p>Dane planted his hands on his hips and forced himself to suck in a breath, clear his head. What exactly had happened? The whole way up the trail to the lagoon, he\u2019d been hoping that this would be the day. Once he got to wherever Lan and Coop had claimed was paradise, that maybe they would kiss her a little, maybe seduce her out of her clothes. They\u2019d talked about all being there, going slow with her. But he\u2019d wanted to get inside her. He\u2019d wanted to make love to her.</p><p>Then he\u2019d discovered that Landon had beaten him to the punch.</p><p>When he\u2019d crashed into the clearing to find her, so fucking gorgeous with her head thrown back, taking pleasure from Lan and Cooper, he\u2019d felt dizzy with shock. He\u2019d stood there and watched as she\u2019d given herself to them, and his blood had boiled with betrayal. Terrible accusations had spewed from his mouth. On the way back to base camp, he\u2019d cursed. This wasn\u2019t her fault, or Coop and Lan\u2019s.</p><p>It was his own.</p><p>While on top of him, Lan had allowed Alea the control she\u2019d undoubtedly needed. His buddies could be gentle with Alea. They could treat her right. They didn\u2019t have perverse needs.</p><p>They were better for her than he was.</p><p>Cooper and Landon hadn\u2019t been kicked out of the military. Oh, Dane had been allowed to leave of his own accord, but everyone knew he\u2019d been a hairsbreadth away from a court martial. Alea deserved an honorable lover, and he wasn\u2019t that.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have a family anymore. They\u2019d all turned their backs on him. He didn\u2019t have wealth or even much of a future. When he really thought about it, he didn\u2019t have a whole fucking lot to offer her. He scrubbed a hand through his hair. He should have kept it together, but no, he\u2019d said some terrible things because he\u2019d felt so damn inadequate in that moment. He\u2019d just known that she\u2019d waited until he was gone and she was alone with Lan and Coop to make love. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sank down into the sand, his head in his hands. He\u2019d walked into that little piece of paradise and he\u2019d turned into a kid again. He\u2019d been eight fucking years old and his brothers had been taking what he wanted just because they could, so he\u2019d lashed out. How pathetic was he?</p><p>\u201cDane?\u201d A soft voice pulled him out of his misery.</p><p>Alea stood looking at him. She was wearing Cooper\u2019s T-shirt, her golden legs bare and her feet sinking into the sand. He\u2019d expected to see rage on that gorgeous face, but she was looking down at him with doe eyes.</p><p>And all he could do was beg for forgiveness. \u201cI am so sorry.\u201d</p> <p>She sniffled a little before sinking into the sand next to him. \u201cAt first I was going to throw things at you like a warrior princess. I think I\u2019d better leave the battling to you guys because all the enemy has to do is look sad and I give up.\u201d</p><p>Her heart would always be too soft for real war. She proved it by sliding her arm against his. He was willing to take any warmth she would give.</p><p>\u201cI jumped to conclusions and said things...\u201d Dane sighed. \u201cI was a complete ass.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. \u201cYou were. We weren\u2019t trying to shut you out. I know that\u2019s what you think. But for once in my life, I was in the moment. So much of my life is planned out for me\u2014schedules, appearances, even my meals. I didn\u2019t want this to be planned, too, Dane. I was swimming with nature, basking in the sun...and I felt so free. I wanted to keep that feeling. I wanted to share it.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. He kissed the top of her head, loving how she opened up to him. He\u2019d been the one to fuck up, yet she was still here with him, offering his dumb ass comfort. \u201cI want that for you, too, Lea.\u201d</p> <p>She pulled back slightly so she could look up at him. Her gorgeous face was so grave, he would have done just about anything to get the softness back. \u201cAre you sure you want this kind of relationship?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t in the beginning. At all. \u201cI wasn\u2019t taught to share, Alea. But, yes, I want this. I screwed up today. I can only say I\u2019m sorry and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be sure? Dane, I know about your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my wife.\u201d He couldn\u2019t even stand to think about her now.</p><p>\u201cYour ex-wife. She left you for your brother, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother turned out to be the better bet. And he didn\u2019t need to tie her up to get off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou needed to tie her up?\u201d Alea frowned. \u201cI mean, like always?\u201d</p><p>She sounded daunted by the prospect. \u201cNo. Not always, but toward the end I realized I wasn\u2019t in love with her, so sex became a game. There was no making love in that relationship. There was an exchange of goods and services. When I got cut off from the family money, she found another way to tap into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make up for what she did to you. But this is the kind of relationship where jealousy just can\u2019t have a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you to make up for what happened to me.\u201d Was he?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fix what she did, either. Dane, I believe this relationship can work, but not if you\u2019re going to make me choose. I grew up differently than you. I know this will require a shift in your thinking, but I\u2019m crazy about all three of you. My aunt and uncles were so happy, and I want that for myself. I want that for us. But it can\u2019t work if you don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll care for you all wholly and equally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done everything I know to make this work.\u201d The accusation stung. He\u2019d been the one to bring them all together. He\u2019d been the one to pull Lan out of his damn shell and to soothe Coop\u2019s doubts. He\u2019d been the one to get Alea talking. Sure she didn\u2019t like discussing her abduction, but she at least opened up about how she felt now.</p><p>For his effort, he should have had her first.</p><p>Goddamn it. She was right. Dane cursed. He wasn\u2019t looking at this from a \u201cfamily\u201d point of view. He\u2019d been selfish and dumb and he\u2019d ruined it for her. He\u2019d been the one to tell her to go with the fucking flow. He\u2019d just been sure the flow would bring her straight to him.</p> <p>He had forced all of them to try to face their demons, but he hadn\u2019t even started to face his own.</p><p>There was a part of him that wanted to slink away. He could go to the other side of the island and not have to deal with any of this shit. He could be alone. It was what he deserved, but was it what she deserved?</p><p>What she deserved was a man who was fucking brave enough to tell her the truth. He hid behind his Dom role so often that he forgot she needed a place in this family, too and not just the one on her back. She wasn\u2019t a blow up doll they were going to pass around. If he wanted to know her, really know her, he had to let her know him, too.</p><p>Families were so fucking scary. His own had let him down. He would rather face down ten guns than risk heartache again. Unfortunately, when he forced himself to acknowledge the truth, he couldn\u2019t deny that he yearned for a family more than anything. He wanted this family\u2014Alea and these brothers.</p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m having a hard time trusting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain that. Make me understand.\u201d She turned her face up, those dark eyes full of sympathy.</p><p>Dane knew a whole lot of his friends would have backed off then and there, sympathy equaling pity in their heads, but Dane took it for what it was, an offering from a deeply kind and loving woman. He hadn\u2019t known a hell of a lot of love and kindness in his life. He latched on to it now, taking her hand in his and holding on for dear life. The man his father had created wanted to pick up his shit and run to the other side of the island and let bitterness be his only friend, but Dane knew that would make him miserable. Instead, he was going to be the man Alea needed, the kind who embraced happiness. It was a gamble, and if he lost, well...at least he\u2019d have the consolation of knowing he\u2019d given it his all.</p><p>\u201cThe whole family thing. I think that\u2019s why I tried to be the one in control of all of it. If you all needed me, then you wouldn\u2019t get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>She leaned closer, her skin warm against his, and he felt all the ice in his chest starting to melt. He\u2019d tried to put her in this very position, to need him, but fuck, he needed her.</p><p>\u201cI would never get rid of you, Dane. Why would you think that?\u201d</p><p>At her sweet words, he relaxed a little, shocked by just how nice it was to talk. \u201cBesides the fact that you\u2019ve been trying to fire me since I got hired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m awfully glad I didn\u2019t succeed.\u201d She pressed against him, their hips touching, her arm through his, then she looked up at him for a long moment. \u201cTell me. It\u2019s about more than just your ex, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her perceptive question stunned him, but the beauty of this place and the intimacy of sitting beside her settled him. He\u2019d sat with lots of women, had plenty of lovers, but somehow Alea made him breathe easy. Something about sitting with limbs entwined, the sound of the surf rolling on, brought up a deep well of peace in him. And that made it so much easier for him to talk. He\u2019d thought he would never discuss Kelly with Alea, but she needed to understand. And he was shocked at how good it felt to let go and tell her about his damage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just her, baby. It\u2019s my whole life. My dad was a military man. He believed in running his household like a war camp. He was a Darwinist of the highest order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvival of the fittest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. He thought getting the shit kicked out of me on a regular basis would make me a man. He didn\u2019t hit me himself, just didn\u2019t really stop it when my older brothers did. And yet I still tried to please him, tried to keep up with my brothers. I got married because she was beautiful and my dad liked her. Said she\u2019d make a fine military wife. I didn\u2019t love her. I thought I did, but I didn\u2019t even know who the hell I was. How could I love her? And then the long deployments started, and my team was shipped to Afghanistan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey kicked you out because of what happened in the Korengal Valley, didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, a little startled. \u201cHow do you know about that? It\u2019s supposed to be classified.\u201d</p><p>There was not an ounce of shame on her face. \u201cI snuck into Tal\u2019s office and read your files. He has a very good relationship with the US. They sent him over a lot of stuff on the three of you that no one should know. You did the right thing, Dane. That CIA agent was an asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was covering his own ass. Things didn\u2019t go down the way they should have. We were working on faulty intel, but make no mistake, Lea. I knew what I was doing and I knew I would be out. I made the decision to get those civilians out of the line of fire thereby blowing an undercover op.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved them,\u201d Alea said, her cheek against his arm. \u201cI think it makes you a hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I blew a multi-million dollar op. When I flew home, I expected my wife to be waiting to drive me home from the airport. I knew it was going to be a rough conversation, but I didn\u2019t even get to say a word. She wasn\u2019t there. I got served with divorce papers the minute I stepped off the plane. They were right there in an envelope with a note from my father disowning me and a key to the storage place where they\u2019d shoved all my worldly possessions.\u201d</p><p>Cooper had been standing next to him. He\u2019d been ready to board a plane for Denver to get back home, but he\u2019d stayed with Dane. And eventually they had found Landon, then made it to Bezakistan, to Alea.</p><p>To this island where he just might finally get the family he deserved if he wasn\u2019t an insecure prick.</p><p>\u201cI want this so badly, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t be what you need.\u201d There it was, all out there for the world to see.</p><p>She moved, shifting away from him. He thought for a moment that she would leave, but she cupped his face as she moved, positioning herself between his legs. \u201cTake it easy on me. Let\u2019s go slow and see where it\u2019s heading, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Sir? The word caused his cock to tighten. \u201cNo, Lea. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to shelve that shit.\u201d</p><p>He could do it for her. He wasn\u2019t sure if he could be as passive as Lan had been, but he could try.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not shit, Dane. It\u2019s what you need. You were out of control all your life. I can see that. Even when you were grown, you were still at the mercy of everyone else. You need one place where you have complete and utter control, and I trust you to take care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you need control, too.\u201d That was the problem with their relationship, the basic, never ending, no-solution-at-all problem. They were both damaged, and he wasn\u2019t sure how to fix it.</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cNot like you mean. It\u2019s different for me. I didn\u2019t grow up scared the way you did. I had a great family. The sex stuff is hard for me, but being here has given me a lot of time to think. You said that how I eventually dealt with this would be the measure of what kind of woman I am.\u201d</p><p>He remembered it like it was yesterday. He\u2019d been standing in the background watching Alea with Piper on the evening she became the future queen. Alea had thrown a bunch of bile his way, and Piper hadn\u2019t understood. \u201cI said those things to Piper. You had stomped off in a blaze of rage and sequins.\u201d</p><p>A little smile curled her mouth up. \u201cI didn\u2019t stomp very far. I listened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou eavesdropped.\u201d Little minx.</p><p>\u201cAnother lesson from my childhood. Dane, I listened in on a lot of things. Why do you think I was always in the garden or the hall or wherever the three of you happened to be? Because I couldn\u2019t let myself believe you wanted me and I couldn\u2019t really convince myself that I didn\u2019t want you. I didn\u2019t choose Landon. I went with the flow and made love with my men. This is the way of life in my world. I can\u2019t set up a schedule. I can only promise that I need each of you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want a schedule. God, not at all. \u201cI guess I\u2019m wondering why you need me. Landon is like your knight in shining armor. Cooper makes you laugh. I just seem to make you mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me think. You make me get off my ass and fight. I\u2019m not dumb, Dane. You\u2019ve been topping me from the minute we landed on this island. Oh, you put it in questions and circle it all back around so it sounds like it\u2019s my idea, but I know what you\u2019re doing and I need it. I think it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been missing for a very long time. I know I\u2019ve pushed a lot of people away and made it hard to help me, but you\u2019ve found a way to do it. If you want something to shelve, make it the jealousy.\u201d</p><p>His cock stirred because that last line had been said with a tone of perfectly intended brattiness. She knew exactly how to provoke him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always be possessive.\u201d It was his nature. No amount of beat downs by his brothers had taken that away from him. He\u2019d just gotten good at hiding what he wanted to keep and he\u2019d gotten really fucking good at fighting dirty. But he didn\u2019t have to with Lan and Coop. \u201cDid they send you here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI came myself.

Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me.\u201d</p><p>He felt his whole body go on alert. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re asking for?</p><p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m willing to try. Go easy on me, Sir. Landon was really big and I\u2019m a little sore, but I want you. I want to...play.\u201d</p><p>A haze of lust seemed to envelope him. Yeah, he could play. He could play hard and rough, but he had to be careful. \u201cI can handle it, Lea. I\u2019ll get the lube. I\u2019ll go easy on you.\u201d</p><p>She stopped, frowned. \u201cWe have lube?\u201d</p><p>Of course. He was a Boy Scout. He\u2019d had plans that had involved a metric shit ton of lubricant. \u201cYeah, baby. I\u2019m prepared.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cThe waves took the condoms but not the lube?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He was the one who had to explain this? \u201cBaby, the waves only took one bag. The lube was in a different duffel.\u201d And thank god Lan had made the right call. The lube was way more important. \u201cIf it makes you feel better, he also sacrificed my favorite pair of nipple clamps which are now at the bottom of the sea.\u201d</p><p>Her whole face flushed, but the sweetest smile came over her lips. \u201cWe have to talk about your priorities, Dane. Condoms are more important than lubricant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d She\u2019d just given him an all-access pass, and he was fucking taking it. \u201cI want you pregnant. I want to fill you up because you\u2019re my female and I want the family only you can give me.\u201d</p><p>He dreamed about her round and soft and full of their baby. His children would have such a different experience. They would know love and peace and joy. They would have four parents to protect them. He wanted this life. He wanted to know that if anything happened to him, his precious wife and their offspring would still be loved and protected by his brothers\u2014brothers who would never take from him, but simply enhance his life, be by his side no matter what. He\u2019d been dealt a shitty hand in the past, but this time he\u2019d come up aces.</p><p>\u201cI want that, too,\u201d Alea said quietly. \u201cI thought I would be married by now. I thought I would already have my husbands and I would have kids. I never wanted to wait. I wanted my happy ending\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour husbands are right here, Alea.\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in her eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t know everything.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI know everything I need to know, baby. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here and right now, I believe it. I don\u2019t know that I want to leave this island. It feels like a dream. I don\u2019t want to wake up.\u201d</p><p>They would get rescued. He knew it deep down inside or he wouldn\u2019t risk getting her pregnant. He had faith. But nothing had to change. \u201cYou\u2019re safe with us.\u201d The \u201cus\u201d came easy now. And so did something else. \u201cTake off that shirt. Show me your breasts.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated, but just for a moment, then her hands went to the edge of Cooper\u2019s navy-blue shirt and she started to pull it up, revealing inch after inch of gloriously golden flesh. Her knees. Her thighs. He held his fucking breath as he caught sight of her pussy. She was smooth and golden there, too, with just a flush of pink to show that she\u2019d recently taken a cock. She\u2019d given up her virginity and moved forward, taking another step in her healing.</p><p>\u201cKeep going. I want to see everything.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the shirt up, her belly button coming into view. He loved her roundness and the way her belly sloped into her hips. So graceful. That was Alea. The bottoms of her breasts showed beneath the hem of the shirt, and his cock sprang up long and thick, tenting his sweats. The fucker seemed to be pointing her way.</p><p>Nipples. Hers were sun-kissed brown, and he couldn\u2019t wait to get his mouth on them. But he had control. He needed to have control. For her. For him.</p> <p>He sat back, aware of every cell in his body coming to life for her as she held the shirt in her hand. \u201cToss it away and tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d</p><p>Like she didn\u2019t know what he meant. \u201cI want to know how it felt to be with my brothers.\u201d</p><p>He loved the way she blushed. \u201cIt was nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that won\u2019t do. Tell me how it felt and I don\u2019t want you to use the word nice. Landon isn\u2019t exactly a small boy.\u201d He shrugged a little, moving his hips to give his cock more room. This was right where he wanted to be. In control. \u201cYou live with a guy long enough, you end up seeing more than you\u2019d think or want. It\u2019s not like Coop\u2019s tiny, either. Tell me what you did to them.\u201d</p><p>She sat back on her heels, her knees together. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can talk about this. Can\u2019t you just kiss me?\u201d</p><p>He felt his eyebrow arch. She didn\u2019t understand the word submission, but she would. \u201cI could spank you. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d</p><p>He loved the way she flushed and her mouth made that perfect little O. \u201cYou want to spank me?\u201d</p><p>It was said with a breathy little huff that lifted his hopes. She wasn\u2019t disinterested. \u201cI would kill to spank that ass. I dream about it. I want to get that skin just the perfect shade of pink. Come on, baby, give me a reason to put the flat of my hand on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave Cooper a hand job. I don\u2019t know why they call it that. It didn\u2019t feel like a job.\u201d She spoke way too fast, her words tripping over each other as she flushed.</p><p>\u201cDid you like it, you little vixen?\u201d He hoped she did because he wanted to feel her hand and her mouth on his own cock as soon as possible.</p><p>The sweetest smile crossed her face. Fuck, she was beautiful. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I would, but I liked the way he pulsed in my hand.\u201d</p><p>His cock twitched, his whole body relaxing as he realized she was going to give him everything he needed. She wasn\u2019t running away. She\u2019d come after him, despite his idiotic outbreak. She was smart, his girl. She\u2019d fought for what they all needed, and they needed that kind of courage in a wife. \u201cDid he fill you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I could barely get my hand all the way around it.\u201d</p><p>Alea\u2019s voice went husky, and he could tell the moment she became comfortable. Besides the deepening of her tone, her body relaxed, her knees spreading wide as though she didn\u2019t realize that she opened her pussy wide and lovely. Damn, he needed a camera because that sight needed to be preserved.</p><p>\u201cYou must have done it right. He looked happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to make sure he enjoyed it, but I had never done it before.\u201d</p><p>He reached out for her because the insecurity that slipped into her words hit his heart as hard as it hit his cock. He got to his knees and brushed his lips across hers. \u201cI\u2019m sure you were perfect, Lea. You couldn\u2019t be anything but. I have no doubt Cooper loved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d a masculine voice said.</p><p>His brother was here. A feeling of deep rightness flowed over him, and he knew that not only could he handle this\u2014he wanted it. He glanced behind him and saw Coop and Landon waiting there. Cooper had gotten dressed again, but Lea had stolen his shirt. Lan was in his boxers. Damn. If they were here much longer, they would all be nudists.</p><p>Alea looked over and her hand almost went for the shirt. \u201cMaybe you guys should go.\u201d</p><p>Dane reached out and grabbed the garment, dragging it away from her. No way was he giving this up. \u201cCooper, tell her how much you liked her hand on your cock. Lan, could you please grab the lube? I think we need to start preparing our woman to take all of us.\u201d</p><p>Lan practically ran toward the luggage.</p><p>And Cooper sank into the sand beside him, his eyes on their very naked woman. \u201cI loved it. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. You were amazing, baby. And I think you should suck Dane\u2019s cock while Lan and I start your prep.\u201d</p><p>Oh, his brothers knew just what to do.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Lea.\u201d His voice had gone super deep. Dom voice. Fuck. He wasn\u2019t ever going to use that voice on any woman but her again. She was the end, the final win. He relaxed back against the log they\u2019d dragged into camp that first night. He spread his legs wide so she had a place to plant that gorgeous body.</p><p>She crawled forward. Every sensuous move made his cock jerk. His body felt deliciously heavy.</p><p>\u201cYes, Sir?\u201d Her breasts swayed as she moved on all fours. Fuck. Fuck! He was lucky he wasn\u2019t coming just from the sight of her. Her nipples were hard and pointing down. She looked toward him, those full lips of hers glistening wet as her tongue darted out, sliding across her bee-stung lips.</p><p>\u201cTake my cock out.\u201d He could barely speak. His dick ached to jump out of his pants and lurch toward her.</p><p>She got to her knees, those breasts settling in and looking so fine he couldn\u2019t help but smile. He spread his legs out as her hands moved to his waistband. He was damn happy he\u2019d gone commando. It left one less layer between them. He pushed his hips up as she dragged his pants down. His cock bobbed free, a sense of deep relief flowing through him.</p><p>\u201cKiss it.\u201d He didn\u2019t measure his voice. She could handle it. He would need to go slow when it came to holding her down, but she didn\u2019t have a problem with commands. His girl would just refuse any order she wasn\u2019t ready for. Everything else was play, just fun and relaxation. Anything serious they would work through, and that gave him comfort.</p><p>It was funny. He\u2019d topped women for a long time, the trust seeming to flow one way, and now he realized what he\u2019d been missing. Trust should flow both ways. He trusted Alea to tell him what didn\u2019t work for her. He trusted her to know what she needed when it came to sex so he didn\u2019t have to worry if this was all weighted toward him. He was a service top, a Dom who needed to give pleasure and satisfaction to his submissive. Alea would never accept less. She was his perfect partner.</p><p>A little grin lit her face as she leaned forward, letting him know she wanted to play as much as he did. And then her lips connected with the head of his cock, and he stopped thinking about anything at all. Well, beyond how hot her mouth was. Her little pink tongue darted out, laving the sensitive head.</p><p>\u201cLick me.\u201d Today would be just a small taste. Eventually he\u2019d give her a full meal, but not this time. He wanted to get inside her. Needed it like he needed his next fucking breath.</p><p>She leaned back down, showing him the graceful arc of her spine and the way the sun kissed her silky skin and brought out the shades of her hair. She fascinated him. And she had him moaning as she ran her tongue over the slit.</p><p>Her tongue moved over his cock, rubbing and nuzzling and lighting him up. She explored freely, trying to map his every hill and valley, line and groove. There was nothing fast and hard about the way she sucked a cock. It wasn\u2019t done to get him off in the quickest way possible. Alea loved his cock, lavished it with affection, took her time as she licked around the head and ran her lips across the vein on the underside. He watched her, giving up control for a moment because seeing her find her power was a magical thing.</p><p>\u201cGod, that is beautiful.\u201d Landon was watching intently on his knees in the sand beside them. Cooper stared, too.</p><p>It was beautiful. Dane closed his eyes, letting the moment roll over him. He wanted to memorize every second. The breeze from the ocean, the softness of the blanket under them, a barrier to the ever-present sand, the way her hair tickled across his thighs. The soft sound of her mouth suckling him.</p><p>The knowledge that he wasn\u2019t alone, would never be alone again, filled him. He had his wife and his brothers.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and Alea stared up him with languid, dark eyes, even as her tongue ran his length.</p><p>\u201cYou are so perfect.\u201d He reached out and stroked her hair, worshipping her as she worshipped him.</p><p>Landon watched, but his gaze met with Dane\u2019s, a question lurking there. He was asking if he could join in.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start getting our girl ready for us.\u201d</p><p>A smile split Lan\u2019s face, making him look happier than Dane could remember.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with that, too,\u201d Cooper promised with a laugh as they positioned themselves around Alea.</p><p>Her head came up. \u201cPrepare me for what?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes and pointed back to his erection. \u201cWe\u2019ll prepare you for a spanking if you don\u2019t get that sweet mouth back where it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, but it was a flirty thing. \u201cBossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby,\u201d he groaned as she put her mouth all over him again. He was the boss and that was just how he wanted this to be. Dane relaxed and shifted his hips up. \u201cPlay with my balls, Lea. And get that gorgeous ass in the air.\u201d</p><p>It was time to get her ready. It was time to share with his brothers.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Alea loved the way Dane tasted. She loved the soft velvet of his cock under her tongue. She definitely loved the way he moaned. Oh, it was a completely controlled, utterly masculine moan, but it came from deep in his chest, a definite sign that he loved this, too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was giving her orders, but she felt her power.</p><p>\u201cI told you to play with my balls, baby. Do we need to have a discussion about the word obedience?\u201d The question came out on a sexy growl.</p><p>She looked up his perfectly cut body, and he stared down at her with those blue eyes. So often they reminded her of a frigid lake, but there was nothing cold about them now. Though his voice was perfectly controlled, his eyes told a different tale. They were hot, a little desperate.</p><p>He wanted her. She could feel it. And it wasn\u2019t that he wanted any woman. He wanted her. He\u2019d waited for her.</p><p>Alea didn\u2019t understand it, but she wasn\u2019t about to turn him down. And she wasn\u2019t going to push him to spank her when she was more than curious to play with his balls. She let her hand run down the length of his cock, skimming the bulbous head. Fascinating. She loved watching the way it twitched and moved as though following her fingers as she felt her way down to the heavy sac that rested below his cock.</p><p>Big and round, the globes had been groomed at some point. The men had managed to find razors and though Dane was letting a sexy beard shape his face, he\u2019d taken care of himself down under. His balls were smooth, like twin plums hanging from the hottest tree. As she watched, they tightened, pulling up closer to his body.</p><p>There was a neat line of flesh dividing the two sacs, and Alea outlined it with her fingertip, watching the way he reacted. He gave a sharp intake of breath, and his thighs tightened as though he was holding himself in rigid check.</p><p>\u201cDoes that hurt?\u201d Alea asked.</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d Dane\u2019s face was rock hard, his jaw a sharp line as he ground the words out. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>She cupped them, secure that it was all right to continue. She could hear Landon moving behind her and Cooper was suddenly at her side, his hand smoothing up her back. Her men were with her.</p><p>Alea rolled his testicles. They were so big, they couldn\u2019t quite fit in the palm of her hand, but she caressed them, closing her hand gently, squeezing just a little. She palmed them and leaned back to take the head of his cock back in her mouth again. It slid in just behind her teeth, and she sucked him, loving the salty taste on her tongue.</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s so good, baby.\u201d Dane\u2019s hand found her hair, an encouraging gesture. He settled his fingers in the strands and helped her keep the rhythm.</p><p>Over and over. Around with her tongue. There was a peace and serenity in serving him in this fashion, a music they were making together. It wasn\u2019t dirty. She wanted to give, and he gratefully accepted. The act was beautiful. Oh, it could be made dirty. She\u2019d seen that up close and personal, but it didn\u2019t have to be. Sex, Alea realized, was different for everyone. It could only be judged by the motivations and emotions behind it. She wanted to please her partners, and her men were careful about pleasing her.</p><p>They were in love.</p><p>A hand cupped the cheeks of her ass, and Landon\u2019s voice rumbled along her skin. \u201cOur girl seems to like the hell out of sucking cock, Dane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does it beautifully,\u201d Cooper responded.</p><p>\u201cPeace to that, brother.\u201d Dane let out a long breath. \u201cShe\u2019s the best head of my life.\u201d</p><p>Alea felt her skin practically glowing. She knew they merely said all this to infuse her with confidence, but it worked anyway.</p><p>\u201cI think we should challenge her a little bit,\u201d Dane said. \u201cShe\u2019s damn straight perfect at sucking a cock when she doesn\u2019t have a distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can give her a distraction or two.\u201d Landon chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI can help.\u201d Cooper\u2019s voice was filled with sexy male arrogance.</p><p>Alea wasn\u2019t sure what they meant by distractions, but refused to worry. Instead, she settled back to her task. She wanted to see if she could make him lose that vaunted control of his and fill her mouth.</p><p>Then she felt Cooper plucking at her nipples, pulling a hard gasp from her throat. Coop\u2019s fingers rolled the nubs with practiced ease, then pinched down. The sharp pain sent pure sensation through her body. Her nipples seemed to have a direct line to her pussy. Yes. That was very distracting.</p> <p>\u201cLandon, she\u2019s stopped. Could you please help me?\u201d Dane asked, his hand tightening on her hair.</p><p>She heard the smack to her backside before she actually felt it. The slap cracked through the air, an oddly sultry sound, before her skin flared as she felt the sensation sink in. Lan kept his hand where it was as though trying to soothe the place he\u2019d just hit.</p><p>Her breath hitched because that had not been what she was expecting at all. Wow. Yes, there had been pain, but then it flared to a shimmering heat. The sensations were deeply erotic.</p><p>\u201cAgain, Lan. She hasn\u2019t gotten the message,\u201d Dane said.</p><p>Quicker than she could prepare herself, the slap found her other cheek, and Cooper pinched down hard on her nipples as though this was a symphony he and Lan had practiced and perfected. Alea moaned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she cares about the message,\u201d Lan said in a Texas drawl. \u201cI think our girl likes to be spanked. Her pussy is wet as hell. I can see it glistening, and damn, she smells good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLea, love,\u201d Dane said in a deeply patient voice. \u201cYou need to take care of me. If you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll stop and have a full spanking. But if you manage to continue, Cooper and Lan here are going to play with you. They want to give you orgasms, but they\u2019ll only do it while you\u2019re sucking me.\u201d</p><p>Orgasms. She\u2019d kind of thought they were a myth until she\u2019d given herself over to these men. Now she was greedy for them, her whole body softening at the prospect of another.</p><p>She leaned over once more and sucked Dane\u2019s cock into her mouth, pulling him inside inch by delicious inch. She had to work to take him all, forcing her jaw wide so she could fit him deep. She loved working her lips open, pushing down on him as she tried to get his whole hot shaft in her mouth, the pressure threatening to make her blink. Then the deep breath of relief as she worked back up his cock, her jaw loosening and her tongue swirling all around him. Over and over. Catch and release.</p><p>She settled back into her rhythm, the hands on her breasts just another part of the music she made.</p><p>Then Lan\u2019s fingers slipped inside her pussy. One, at first, and then two. He didn\u2019t linger inside, but scissored and stretched her, as though massaging the nagging little ache that had taken up residence after his possession.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t thinking about anything like soreness now, just about how she was going to get him to give her a third finger. She wasn\u2019t full enough. Her mouth was lovingly full of Dane, but her pussy wasn\u2019t. Landon had given her his big cock, and now she couldn\u2019t handle anything less.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s fingers continued to pluck the sensitive tips of her breasts, squeezing and nipping her in perfect time.</p><p>She sucked at Dane, trying to keep her attention on his cock as Lan pulled out. She could feel Dane\u2019s cock swell in her mouth, his hips starting to move.</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Dane pulled gently on her hair.</p><p>Alea didn\u2019t want to stop. She wanted to keep going until he\u2019d filled her mouth, but he was insistent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too close,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I want to be in your pussy the first time I come with you. I want to feel that tight cunt of yours gripping me as I get off.\u201d</p><p>He moved back, getting to his knees and moving away. \u201cLandon, let\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>Started? It felt like they\u2019d finished, and she couldn\u2019t stand the thought. Even though she\u2019d made love with Landon and Cooper not thirty minutes before, she needed Dane to fill her.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to be a little cold, baby,\u201d Dane warned.</p><p>Something liquid and chilly slid between her ass cheeks. She couldn\u2019t help the gasp that came from her chest. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She had a suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI told you. We\u2019re preparing you,\u201d Dane said, as someone pulled her cheeks apart.</p><p>\u201cPreparing me?\u201d She\u2019d known deep down they would want this, but already? Now?</p><p>Dane\u2019s chuckle played along her spine as he kissed her right at the small of her back. \u201cYes, Lea. I\u2019m prepping you to take all of us. I won\u2019t accept less, and you shouldn\u2019t either. One of us will fill your pussy, another one your mouth. Then the last one will squeeze into your sinful ass. We\u2019ll share you. Eventually, you\u2019ll take all of us in every way. Do you understand what the word sharing means, baby?\u201d</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t before, she did now. Dane\u2019s words painted her a vivid mental picture. Now she understood what Piper meant when she talked about being sore in triplicate.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should talk about this,\u201d Alea said, trying to turn back to see them.</p><p>A loud smack cracked through the air, and she was gasping. Two smacks. Three. Dane kept it up, smacking her ass over and over until she\u2019d counted to ten. Tears pricked her eyes, but by the fourth slap of his hand against her, she felt the sweet heat sinking in and making her shiver with need.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking, Lea,\u201d Dane said, a deep command in his voice. \u201cWe\u2019re preparing.\u201d</p><p>Cooper leaned close to her ear, his tongue sliding over the shell. \u201cYou can always say stop, but god, your skin is so pretty all pink. I like watching you get spanked and I\u2019m going to like watching you get plugged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlugged?\u201d</p><p>Cooper smiled, his gorgeous face coming into view. He took Dane\u2019s place, but leaned toward her, pressing their lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice little plug. Pink. We bought it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon saved the anal plug, but not the condoms?\u201d They needed to talk about Lan\u2019s priorities.</p><p>A hand slid up her spine as she felt a firm pressure against her anus. Oh, god. They were touching her there. She\u2019d never been touched there. She shivered at the forbidden feeling. Pressure built, a jangly pleasure-pain shocking her system.</p><p>\u201cThe plug set was in another case, along with the lube and the whip. But the nipple clamps are gone. I mourn them.\u201d Cooper kissed her again. \u201cWe bought everything special for you. Tal has this guy.\u201d</p><p>She could just bet. Her cousin was a pervert of the first order. She could imagine that Tal had a Royal Toy Maker on staff. It had likely been very easy for her boys to make an appointment. \u201cYou brought all this stuff with you?\u201d</p><p>Dane sent her a low chuckle. \u201cWe had to hurry. We thought we\u2019d have weeks to start to get you into the right mode of thinking, but then we found out about your little getaway and we hauled ass to kit up.\u201d</p><p>The pressure was starting to get to her. No pain. Not at all. Just an oddly intimate sensation as someone pressed something against the rosette of her ass. She tried to concentrate on their words. Kit up. Most people would just pack things like clothes and toiletries, but not her guys. No. They had to make sure they had all the finest sexual aids. \u201cSo you picked out a butt plug for me?\u201d</p><p>Not exactly the gift she\u2019d thought she\u2019d get.</p><p>\u201cNot just one. We picked out a whole set,\u201d Cooper explained. \u201cAnd right now they\u2019re not using the plug. Landon is using his finger. He lubed up his finger and he\u2019s stretching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so fucking gorgeous, Lea,\u201d Lan ground out.</p><p>He was rimming her, pressing in and circling her untried hole, tempting her to open up for him.</p><p>\u201cLea, we want to share you. Totally. Without reservations. We want to be inside you, all of us at the same time.\u201d Dane\u2019s voice was a dark seduction. She felt a strong palm run down her spine. \u201cRelax. Let us in. We\u2019re going to get in. We\u2019re going to take this ass the same way we take your pussy and your mouth\u2014thoroughly and completely. We\u2019ll prep you, baby. You\u2019ll be ready for us.\u201d</p><p>All three of them at the same time. She would be totally surrounded, utterly protected by her men.</p><p>She closed her eyes and eased back as Landon\u2019s finger pressed in. Her eyes watered, the pressure just on the edge of pain, but so erotic. She could feel herself clenching. She could feel their stares on her, caressing every inch of her exposed skin.</p><p>A smack to her ass made her moan.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you try to keep him out,\u201d Dane growled. \u201cYou let him inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d Cooper kissed her again, his tongue playing against hers. \u201cOpen for him. You\u2019ll like it in the end. Take a deep breath and flatten your back.\u201d</p><p>The pressure was killing her, and not from pain. She was so aware of everything. They were forcing her out of a place where she thought and worried and into a place where she simply felt.</p><p>She breathed in, the sweetly salty air filling her lungs as she obeyed. She flattened her back, forcing her spine down. She felt the moment Lan\u2019s finger slipped inside her ass.</p><p>Now that was an intimate sensation.</p><p>\u201cFuck, darlin\u2019. You are so tight. Damn, you can barely take my pinkie, but one day, this gorgeous ass is going to be split wide by my cock.\u201d</p><p>She had to concentrate on breathing, the sensation was a little shocking, and she whimpered, trying to get used to the invasion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing good, baby,\u201d Cooper encouraged her, his lips on the nape of her neck.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing perfectly,\u201d Dane agreed. \u201cAlea, are you in pain, baby? This isn\u2019t supposed to be painful. There will be a little discomfort until you\u2019re used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d She snapped the question at him.</p><p>And he slapped her ass again\u2014with Lan\u2019s finger in there. She gasped at the sensation.</p> <p>Dane was suddenly right next to her, his body towering overs her even though he was on his knees. \u201cI know because I trained for this. Dominance and submission is serious, Lea. Sex isn\u2019t something I do and then forget about. I won\u2019t ever put you in danger.\u201d</p><p>The sharp set of his face left her no doubt that he was being honest. He was also making himself vulnerable, even as he looked at her with those dark eyes. He was waiting for her judgment, for her to accept him\u2014or not\u2014as he was. A sudden joy hit her system. He was offering her his truth, and there was something beautiful about that.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t turn them away. They were in paradise. Nothing bad could happen now because she was surrounded by them. \u201cYes, Sir. I\u2019ll try to keep the sarcasm to a minimum, but it\u2019s very difficult to be serious when Lan is giving me a colon exam.\u201d</p><p>Dane growled, but he was smiling as he did it. \u201cThat\u2019s another ten. Damn it, you\u2019re going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>His cock, already hard, had tightened even further as he\u2019d promised her discipline. He was gone in a flash, proving that he really did enjoy the whole spanking thing.</p> <p>\u201cYou keep up what you\u2019re doing, Lan. No need to stop because our submissive has a bratty mouth.\u201d Dane\u2019s voice was right back to smooth and deep, and she was starting to recognize that this was his Dom voice. He\u2019d used it on her more than once when he snapped an order her way. Those orders almost always had to do with her safety. Then his tone was hard, unrelenting, but the same unmistakable air of command was there. But this was sexy Dom, whose rough edges softened marginally as if he lived for this type of command.</p><p>She groaned as the pressure in her ass increased. Another finger. God, he was stretching her, opening her up, and all she could do was try to stay on her knees.</p><p>It soon became harder because Dane\u2019s hand found her cheek, connecting and making her howl.</p><p>Shit. It hurt and it made her eyes water, but she wanted more. She could feel Cooper\u2019s hand soothing over the skin of her back, a perfect contrast to the sharp sting of the smacks. Dane settled in and Landon kept up the pressure, scissoring his fingers deep inside, pulling out and pushing in while Dane lit her up from the outside. Over and over. It seemed to take forever, yet it was over before she\u2019d really drawn a deep breath. Tears squeezed from her eyes, but they felt good, clean, uncompromised. She laughed a little on a breath as she steadied herself.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d Cooper asked, reaching up and touching those tears.</p><p>She smiled at him, feeling so strong even as her knees were weak. \u201cI can take it.\u201d</p> <p>The words were a revelation. She could take it. She could take them. She didn\u2019t want to go hide somewhere or just get through the next few minutes so maybe someone would hold her. She wanted to take that dumb plug and then she wanted Dane to mount her and give her the orgasm she needed.</p><p>She felt more feminine and powerful than she\u2019d ever felt before. Kneeling in the sand, submitting to these men showed her strength.</p><p>\u201cI know you can.\u201d Dane\u2019s voice floated over her, the anchor she needed to keep herself grounded. \u201cI\u2019ve always known you could. You\u2019re my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our girl,\u201d Lan corrected.</p><p>\u201cOurs.\u201d She could practically hear the smile in Dane\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for her to take this plug because I don\u2019t want to wait weeks to share her. I want to get in her ass as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>There was her dirty Dom.</p><p>Alea winced a little as she felt Lan\u2019s fingers leaving her and he moved out from behind her. She clenched as though trying to get that feeling back, but there was already something pressing at her. Dane had taken Lan\u2019s place, and he pushed the plug right against her tight hole.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get cleaned up. I get the feeling this is going to be a nice long day.\u201d Lan got on his knees and leaned over, his lips touching her head sweetly. \u201cBe right back, baby. You take everything he gives you. I want to watch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck, I\u2019m already watching.\u201d She turned and saw Cooper had gotten rid of those confining shorts of his. She\u2019d never thought a cock could be gorgeous, but her men had lovely ones. Cooper ran his hand along his thick stalk as his eyes trailed back. \u201cYou know how beautiful you are?\u201d</p><p>She felt beautiful when they were around. \u201cI want to watch, too.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to watch Cooper stroke himself while she submitted to Dane.</p><p>\u201cWatch all you like, baby.\u201d He sat back and spread his legs wide, stroking himself, his cock growing bigger and harder with every pass of his hand.</p><p>\u201cThere we go,\u201d Dane said as the plug slid home, invading and stretching, taking up all the space. \u201cYou\u2019re going to wear that for a while. And you\u2019re going to wear me, too.\u201d</p><p>She felt Dane\u2019s big hands on her hips, pulling her back, and then he was fondling her breasts as she felt his cock rooting at her pussy.</p><p>Yes, this was what she\u2019d needed from the moment their fight had begun. She\u2019d needed to take him inside, to know he was with her. She felt him pulling at her nipples as though trying to get her ready, but the minute his cock had touched her, she\u2019d softened. \u201cPlease, Sir. Dane. Please.\u201d</p><p>His hands seemed to be everywhere, running along her every curve, worshipping her. She wanted to be able to see him as he filled her up, but even as she thought about it, she knew she wasn\u2019t ready to lie underneath him. He was giving her what she needed, how she needed it, and he was sharing the experience with his brother.</p><p>Cooper smiled her way even as he moved closer, his hand never letting up on the slow stroke of his cock. \u201cDo you know how happy you make us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us,\u201d Dane added. \u201cI\u2019ve waited my whole fucking life for this.\u201d</p><p>She gasped as he drove his cock inside her.</p><p>So full. Oh, she was so damn full. She clenched around the plug and Dane\u2019s cock. He was so big and he\u2019d forced himself in to the hilt, sparing her not a moment of his hard possession.</p><p>Because that was Dane. He would fight for her, die to protect her, but he needed to be in control of this moment. For the first time, she saw that it was a fair trade. The love between them didn\u2019t have to be fifty-fifty every minute of the day. There would be times when he let her have her way...and other times when he would conquer and take her however he pleased. The thought made her moan.</p><p>He held himself still for a heartbeat, his hands on her hips, tightening as though he was afraid of losing her. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Alea winced. She\u2019d done a number on him.</p><p>She smiled at Cooper. \u201cWill you tell him, please?\u201d</p><p>A brilliant grin crossed his face. \u201cShe can take you. She can take me. We already know she can take Lan. Our girl\u2019s made of strong stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, what a woman.\u201d He smacked her ass, making her cry out because every nerve lit up. \u201cYou\u2019ll take me when I say. How I say. For as long as I say. Isn\u2019t that right, my pretty sub?\u201d</p><p>Why had she ever been afraid of him? Now that she really knew this man, she heard what he meant. You\u2019ll take me, and I\u2019ll take care of you. \u201cYes, Sir. I\u2019ll take you anyway you want.\u201d</p><p>She would try anything with them.</p><p>Dane moved behind her, dragging his cock back out, just keeping the tip in before diving back deep. \u201cMove with me.\u201d</p><p>He was letting her off the leash, and she gave him everything she had. She slammed back toward him, fighting to keep him inside, then shifted to start the process again. Over and over, she slammed against him, his cock pushing up, filling her until she thought she would burst, but she fought for her pleasure, fought for this feeling of oneness with him. She lost herself in the sun and the sand and her men.</p><p>She heard Dane groaning as he shifted up and hit that miraculous place deep inside her and sent her flying. Her vision seemed to dim briefly as the orgasm propelled her into a white-hot realm of pleasure.</p><p>Dane pulled her body up, her length against his as he groaned and pumped his orgasm into her body. \u201cOur woman.\u201d</p><p>He turned her head to his as his cock slipped out of her, his lips taking hers, each moment progressively more gentle than the last. Her body hummed, her blood pumping through her system. She kissed Dane again. Then she caught sight of Cooper still and watchful, his back against the log, his legs stretched in front of him. His cock strained, long and thick, just begging for her.</p><p>The old Alea would have wondered if he simply didn\u2019t want her, even in the face of massive evidence to the contrary, but the dark doubt that had been with her since the day she\u2019d been taken had finally begun to fade. The very act of loving her men seemed to have turned down the volume on those voices in her head. She heard different voices all of the sudden, their voices telling her that she was beautiful and sexy and worthy.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate, didn\u2019t feel self-conscious. She felt...new, free. She moved to Cooper, her body sensuous and alive.</p><p>Cooper shook his head. \u201cLea, baby, you\u2019ve got to be sore.\u201d</p><p>Even as he said the words, she could see how his cock pulsed with need, the purple head weeping.</p><p>She was sore, but it was a delicious ache. \u201cI need you, too.\u201d</p><p>Dane and Lan were suddenly on either side of her, helping to settle her on Cooper\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cWe have to face facts,\u201d Lan said with a smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve created a monster.\u201d</p><p>For once, Cooper didn\u2019t get the joke. He tensed under her, his cock beneath her pussy, still long and thick and begging. \u201cPlease, Lea. I\u2019m dying to be inside you.\u201d</p><p>She groaned with pleasure as she lowered herself, and Cooper\u2019s cock began to penetrate. Each of her men were so different, and all so good. Cooper\u2019s cock was thick and seemed to almost immediately find that special place deep inside her. She\u2019d been so sure she couldn\u2019t possibly come again, but as Cooper gripped her hips and thrust up, she felt the stir of orgasm teasing along her skin.</p><p>\u201cLea,\u201d Cooper\u2019s voice was breathless. His hips never stopped their rolling movement. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, baby. It\u2019s feels so good.\u201d</p><p>She stared at his gorgeous, masculine face, the strong jaw, the chiseled cheeks. She looked into those deep dark eyes, and the connection leapt between them, so much more than merely physical. She moved with him, their bodies finding a rhythm that was uniquely their own. Comfort and desire. She found a lovely blend with Cooper.</p><p>\u201cYou feel incredible. I\u2019m so happy.\u201d She had to say the words because they were true. How long had it been since she\u2019d felt this sense of joy? Perhaps never. Perhaps this was the kind of happiness that only happened when everything fell into place, when a person\u2019s puzzle was complete.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. So happy. Oh, god, Lea.\u201d Cooper picked up the pace, his face tightening.</p><p>One deep thrust sent her over the edge, and this orgasm was the cherry on top. He called out her name again as he clutched her to him. Pleasure flooded her system as she felt Cooper\u2019s cock deep inside her. Then he came, filling her with everything he had.</p><p>Lea let her body fall against Cooper\u2019s, their chests cuddling together.</p><p>She forgot about the past. She didn\u2019t think about the future. She just let herself drift in this sweetest of moments.</p><p>Cooper forced his head up as he watched Alea come out of the surf, her naked body revealing itself to him with every footstep she took. She brushed her hair back with a scrub of her hand and turned her face up to the sun. Just like that his cock went to full mast, come-on-baby, take-me erection.</p><p>Damn, he liked paradise.</p><p>Four weeks and five days. They had been on the island for all that time without a hint of rescue, and he was beginning to wonder if he even wanted to see a plane.</p><p>Alea looked so relaxed, so fucking full of joy. Her shoulders weren\u2019t up around her ears, and she\u2019d just stopped wearing clothes around day fourteen. That was fine with him.</p><p>She took a long breath and looked around the beach. As she caught sight of him, a bright smile lit her face. She looked so carefree, so uninhibited. He wished he could take a picture, but the batteries on their phones had died weeks ago. But he wanted to capture her like this. He never wanted to see worry in her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you check the traps?\u201d Alea asked as she stood in the shallows, wringing out the water in her hair.</p><p>This island was like a fucking protein basket. They all looked a bit leaner, but everything here was so fresh and healthy. He felt great.</p><p>\u201cYep. We\u2019ll have fish for lunch and some nice roast pork for dinner. Dane\u2019s been roasting that last pig real slow for two days. When I saw him earlier, he was shoveling pineapple into the pit for flavor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His stomach growled a little. He was pretty sure that a month into being stranded he should be begging for food, not wondering if Dane wasn\u2019t overcooking their dinner. He\u2019d gotten picky about his wild boar.</p><p>Alea laughed and threw herself onto the sand beside him. Yep. They would be getting right back in the ocean before they headed to camp. She sighed happily and put her head on his shoulder. \u201cI see Mr. Happy is making an appearance.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d named his penis, and she\u2019d done it real damn well. His penis was happy. Fucking thrilled, in fact. \u201cBaby, that\u2019s his permanent state around you.\u201d</p><p>He moved his arm so he could get it under her neck, cradling her properly. He had to admit, he loved the nights when all three of his brothers loved her, but he also enjoyed these long afternoons when he had her to himself. They\u2019d taken to splitting up alone time with their girl. Nights were for the family, but afternoons were split shifts, and mornings were all up to Alea. Whatever she wanted. If she wanted to be alone, they allowed her the illusion that she was. One of them was always watching her because she was the most precious thing in the world and they weren\u2019t about to let her drown or fall or have anything bad happen to her, but they let her be.</p> <p>Afternoons were all about relaxing, and nights were for exploring.</p><p>Yeah, he was in no hurry to go to back to civilization. He kind of loved island life.</p><p>She giggled, actually giggled, and turned her body into his, one leg tangling between his, the intimacy doing strange things to his heart. \u201cI think you\u2019re all just permanently aroused, but I love it.\u201d</p><p>He was glad because they were all on her at least twice a day. He kissed her, relaxing because eventually Mr. Happy would get what he wanted, and Cooper was damn straight content to just lay with her for a minute or two. \u201cI think Dane wants to play with his flogger tonight.\u201d</p><p>Dane had built a Tropical Dungeon. He\u2019d been busy, using their knives and his constructed weapons to build their shelters. Shelters. Because Dane wasn\u2019t happy with some craptastic Survivor hut. No. Only the best for his former CO. He\u2019d managed to put together a sleeping shelter with luxurious pillows and blankets they\u2019d saved from the plane, a shed for food and water storage. And he\u2019d found a cave in the inland that he\u2019d tricked up so they would be comfortable during storms. He was the MacGyver of island living.</p> <p>And Lan was the provider. The dude could kill shit. He had a freaking sixth sense when it came to hunting and fishing. Their bellies were full every night thanks to him.</p><p>Cooper was proud to be the workhorse and the medic and the all-around Alea whisperer. He\u2019d once wondered what role he could play in this family, but he\u2019d discovered that he was the peacekeeper. When the other two didn\u2019t know how to talk to their woman, he was the one they turned to. They were all way better now, but there were still points of contention.</p><p>She still wasn\u2019t ready to handle them being on top of her, and there were still plenty of acts that set her mind spinning back to her captivity.</p><p>Alea rose up to one elbow, looking down on him. Damn, but she was sweeter though. \u201cWhat do you think the flogger is like? I don\u2019t know much about it. I\u2019ve heard the word, but I don\u2019t really know what it means. I know sailors used to get flogged on occasion.\u201d</p><p>He had to smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it like getting whipped?\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want her to worry. They were trying to move her slowly into the BDSM fun. \u201cNot at all. There are a lot of different kinds of floggers, but my personal favorite is deerskin. It\u2019s soft. We can have another one made at some point. But before we would ever play around with it, we would let you touch it, get to know it. It wouldn\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s more like a massage, but it can get you into subspace.\u201d</p><p>Her gorgeous dark eyes rolled slightly. \u201cYeah, you guys like me there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like it there?\u201d</p><p>Her head came back down, resting on his chest, the sun shining down on their bodies. \u201cYou know I do. It\u2019s very relaxing. Who knew that I would find a spanking ultimately relaxing?\u201d</p><p>But spanking hadn\u2019t exactly achieved what they wanted it to. They\u2019d been trying to get her to open up, to talk about what had happened during her captivity. It wasn\u2019t some perverse curiosity. Until she talked about it, she couldn\u2019t really heal, couldn\u2019t move on.</p><p>Cooper wasn\u2019t dumb. This idyll in paradise was a complete break with everything she knew, everything that weighed on her and dragged her down. It was easy to throw off stress about tomorrow here because she didn\u2019t have to worry about being a princess or the press or family obligations. She could be their island lover. He got that, but they had to think about the future.</p><p>They had to think about what happened when they were back in Bezakistan. If they got back to Bezakistan.</p><p>She nuzzled his chest. \u201cIf I relax anymore I might die. You guys won\u2019t let me do anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause we love to take care of you.\u201d He rubbed his hand along her back, down to her ass. He loved her ass. She\u2019d been wearing the plug for a couple of hours every day, going up to a bigger plug twice now. She was almost ready to take them. God, he couldn\u2019t wait. No matter how many times he\u2019d gotten inside her, every damn time seemed like the first.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s because I ruined the conch that second night. No one will let me near the fire. I can learn, you know.\u201d</p><p>She was a horrible cook. Seriously bad. Like had a curse on her bad. \u201cBaby, I like to cook. Don\u2019t take that away from me. Here, come give me a kiss.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d gotten good at fishing with Lan. He was even teaching her to throw a spear, and she\u2019d become the freaking queen of weaving together palm fronds for their ever evolving roof, but he wasn\u2019t letting her near their food.</p><p>\u201cFine, but we\u2019re going to talk about this,\u201d she said, getting to her elbows and bringing her mouth close to his. He loved the husky quality of her voice. She gave in to pleasure so easily now.</p><p>But he hated the boundaries that were still between them.</p><p>He lay back, letting her take the lead when every cell in his body wanted her flat on her back with her ankles around his neck, screaming out his name.</p><p>She leaned over and kissed him, her tongue running along his bottom lip as she reached for his cock. Her small hand played with his balls, cupping them and rolling them before she stroked up his length and let her thumb swipe across the head of his cock.</p><p>Fuck, she was getting so good at that.</p><p>He brought his hands to her hair, tangling them in her damp strands and holding her mouth to his so he could settle his tongue in. This was what he loved. She softened beside him. He started to roll her on to her back. Little bits at a time. Ease her into it.</p><p>She pushed back. \u201cNo. Not like that.\u201d</p><p>Frustration started to well. It wasn\u2019t that he wouldn\u2019t take her any way she would have him. It was that she wasn\u2019t even trying to push past her fears. \u201cLea, baby, can we just try?\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. But you like this.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his throat, an obvious attempt to deflect the problem.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk about it.\u201d He really did, but he adored the way her mouth was covering his skin, her hands running across his muscles.</p><p>\u201cI want to make love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLea, how are you going to take all three of us if you won\u2019t let anyone on top of you?\u201d He forced himself to sit up, his erection complaining mightily, but this was an issue they needed to address.</p><p>She frowned, sitting up and back on her heels, that \u2018imperious princess\u2019 look on her face. He wondered if she\u2019d been taught that look, the one that let everyone know she was royal and they were not. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t interested, I\u2019ll go find Lan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLan wants to be on top of you, too. We all do.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, her eyes turning down. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it will mean you trust us.\u201d</p><p>She softened slightly. \u201cI do trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a point. Talk to me. Give me part of this burden, baby. You don\u2019t have to keep everything rattling around inside you. Just start talking and let it out. It\u2019s a poison in your system until you do.\u201d</p><p>Her fists clenched and for the first time in weeks, he saw that icy persona she used to wear like armor. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, and I would thank you to leave it be. I don\u2019t ask you to bare your soul to me, and I would appreciate it if you would stop trying to delve into mine.\u201d</p><p>He lay back, hating that cold tone that crept into her voice. They\u2019d made some progress with her body but not her soul. \u201cAll right, Lea. You\u2019re right. Go find Lan. I\u2019m going to stay here for a little while, soak up some sun.\u201d</p><p>He knew when he\u2019d hit a brick wall. He closed his eyes because he couldn\u2019t watch her walk away.</p><p>And yet she didn\u2019t move. Her hand crept back to his chest, her palm over his heart. Her voice was soft, almost a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m scared to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>There was a crack in that brick wall. Finally. Maybe they\u2019d done more good than he\u2019d thought. He didn\u2019t open his eyes, giving her some cover, but he put his hand over hers. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be scared of.\u201d</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. \u201cWhy can\u2019t things stay like this? I like it like this.\u201d</p><p>Now he opened his eyes, focused on her. \u201cThings change, Lea. We can\u2019t stop them from changing, but if we really know and love each other, then maybe we can change together. Lots of people start out in love and they really mean it, but that love dies because a couple of years down the road, they\u2019re not the same people anymore. And it doesn\u2019t work anymore because they never really knew one another. I want to know you. I want to know your past and the you right now. I want to grow with the Alea of the future. But I don\u2019t know how we do that if you keep all the doors closed between us.\u201d</p><p>A sad smile curled her lips up. \u201cWe\u2019ve opened a whole lot of doors, Coop.\u201d</p><p>He sat back up because she really had been trying. He caught her mouth with his, a sweet affection. \u201cI know, baby, but this is a damn important door.\u201d</p><p>She took a long breath and her shoulders shuddered slightly. \u201cIt was hell.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap. He\u2019d kind of thought Dane would be around when she opened up, but he wasn\u2019t going to shut her down. \u201cI know, baby, but it can\u2019t hurt you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if some of those doors you want me to open lead to bad places? What if they show you things you might not want to see?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to see any of it, wished it had never happened, but those months were so important to who Alea was now that if they didn\u2019t talk about it, those memories would become landmines that eventually exploded. \u201cThere is nothing you can tell me that will make me love you less, Alea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I feel like I should have done more,\u201d she began quietly. \u201cLots of women died in that place. Why was I kept alive? Why didn\u2019t they rape me? I know that sounds horrible. I\u2019m happy they didn\u2019t, but there\u2019s this piece of me that wonders...\u201d</p><p>He stayed perfectly still. She was like a deer he didn\u2019t want to scare off. So beautiful and fragile and ready to bolt at the slightest sign of danger. He kept his voice quiet, tender. \u201cWonder what, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they had used me the way they did the other girls, maybe it would have been easier on them. Maybe some of them wouldn\u2019t have died. The girl in the room next to me...\u201d Her voice cracked a little, and her hand found his, linking them together. \u201cI could hear her. She was forced to service so many men. So many. They used her until she died. I\u2019m not sure of what, but I know she was dead in her bed one morning a few days before I was rescued. What if I had taken some of her burden?\u201d</p><p>Tears made his vision a blurry mess, and he tightened his hand around hers, willing his love and comfort into her. She didn\u2019t need his strength. She was so damn strong. This guilt had to be a heavy burden to bear. \u201cBaby, you didn\u2019t get to make that choice.\u201d And he was so happy she hadn\u2019t been forced to make the sacrifice. \u201cAnd you have no idea whether it would have helped or not. You didn\u2019t force those men on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt so helpless. So small and meaningless.\u201d</p><p>That was the true horror of what those bastards had done to her, Cooper realized. She\u2019d had her identity and her whole worldview torn apart and ground into the dirt. Alea was a woman who had been taught to reach out to people. It had been bred into her bones. Royalty in Bezakistan worked for the country and for their people. Tal, Rafe, and Kade were constantly in the oil fields and scoping out the work at the site of the new green project. Alea\u2019s aunt still visited hospitals, her days filled with charity work. Alea had been born to do the same. Then she\u2019d been forced into a situation where she could do nothing but watch the women around her suffer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat up and forced her to look at him, gently tilting her head up. Tears streaked down her face. \u201cYou did everything you could. But you aren\u2019t there anymore...\u201d</p><p>Alea turned suddenly, her gaze taking in the ocean. \u201cCooper, I...What is that?\u201d</p><p>A sound like a buzzing, and then a loud splash, followed by another. Cooper looked out over the water and felt his eyes widen. There in the sun and surf was a mirage. It had to be. It couldn\u2019t be a boat coming their way. No. Not a boat because he wasn\u2019t ready. They weren\u2019t ready. He\u2019d just started making real progress with Alea.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boat. Oh my god. Someone\u2019s found us.\u201d Alea stood up, wiping the tears from her eyes. \u201cI have to get dressed. We have to find Lan and Dane. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p> <p>Now it was getting closer, and he could see two men in the body of the boat, their figures still in the distance. He stood with Alea and hugged her because she was close to panic. He could feel it, see it in the way her body stiffened and her eyes became tight.</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cMake them go away, Coop. Make them go away.\u201d</p><p>He held her close, but his heart sank. He couldn\u2019t hold her for long, couldn\u2019t make the moment last because every second brought the boat closer and closer to shore. Reality was encroaching, and they couldn\u2019t meet it like this. They had to find their clothes and get ready for what came next.</p><p>Their time in paradise was over.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p> <p>\u201cThis is Nix. Talk to me.\u201d Lan picked up the phone with absolutely no regard to the fact that the person on the other end of the line had probably called to talk to Dane. He wasn\u2019t willing to let Dominic Anthony wait until Dane got out of what seemed like the longest shower of all time.</p><p>Of course, Dane and Cooper were in the shower with Alea, so it could still be a while.</p><p>A deep voice came over the satellite phone. \u201cNice to know you\u2019re alive, Nix. Have you talked to the sheikh yet, or am I your first call now that you\u2019re back from the dead?\u201d</p><p>Back from the dead? If that had been death, he didn\u2019t want to be alive again. All he could think about was how closed off Alea had become, as though she was shutting down a little more with every mile that stupid boat had put between them and paradise. He\u2019d been surprised she\u2019d allowed Dane and Cooper to usher her into the bathroom of their hotel on Koror, an island in the Palau chain. \u201cHer Highness has already spoken with her cousins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume the plane crash was an attempt on the princess\u2019s life.\u201d There was no uncertainty in Dominic Anthony\u2019s voice.</p><p>Why question an undeniable truth? \u201cOh, yes. There\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve already worked up a profile on the pilot. He was being treated for chronic back pain. It wasn\u2019t life threatening, but several members of his family had heard him talk about not wanting to live with it anymore. Surprisingly enough, his wife said she found twenty thousand in euros in a safe at their house the night he died.\u201d</p><p>That had been the payoff. Cheap. Twenty thousand for six lives. Of course, the pilot had only actually managed to take out himself and the hostess. \u201cWell, it was smart to pull cash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dominic agreed. \u201cHard to follow that trail. I have a few ideas. I\u2019ve been pulling all the CCTV feeds from around the palace and in the surrounding city for the days before the crash. The wife claims the money wasn\u2019t in the safe when she looked two days before her husband died, and we got his day planner. He was supposed to have a meeting with someone, no name, of course, the day before the crash. All I have is the time the meeting supposedly took place in the al Mussad marketplace.\u201d</p><p>Which about twenty thousand people walked through each day, so it would be damn hard to find the culprit, even if they knew who they were looking for. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley\u2019s got some hotshot facial recognition software. Let\u2019s give him some time.\u201d</p><p>Lan didn\u2019t have a choice on that front. \u201cLet me know if you find anything. In the meantime, we want you to look into everyone who knew she would be on that plane, starting with that British asshole who let her take his place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThurston-Hughes? Absolutely. I started that investigation the minute I heard the plane hadn\u2019t made it to Sydney. The funny thing is, ol\u2019 Oliver claims that his brother received an e-mail the day the plane went down, claiming responsibility for killing him and his wife. Anti-monarchists, supposedly. I thought it was rather convenient, especially since we can\u2019t really trace the e-mail. Best we\u2019ve managed so far is to determine it was sent from somewhere in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Where Oliver was currently spending his time.</p> <p>\u201cAnd why would the pilot go through with the job once he was in the air? I get that he might not have gotten an updated passenger list. He\u2019s not the one who loads the fuel and takes care of meals and drinks, but the hostess would have informed him.\u201d It didn\u2019t make a lick of sense to Lan. He\u2019d been involved in a lot of operations, and rule number one was to take out your intended target.</p><p>A long sigh came over the line. \u201cYeah. I thought about that, too. This pilot routinely flew to London, so he could have connections there, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to continue that job if the targets aren\u2019t on board. People who hire assassins tend to want their money\u2019s worth, and they wouldn\u2019t have a problem coming after a pilot\u2019s wife to get their dough back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything incriminating on Oliver? If he\u2019s lying about this so-called threat, he\u2019s probably doing it to cover his own ass.\u201d</p><p>Lan was thinking about offing the guy any way he sliced it, but having an actual case might help at his eventual trial if he got caught. He hadn\u2019t liked the way the Brit had been sniffing around Alea. If the asshole had really wanted her, maybe he\u2019d been the one to have her kidnapped and kept for him. Perhaps he\u2019d decided, since the first plan had failed, that if he couldn\u2019t have her no one could. He\u2019d made it perfectly plain that he didn\u2019t appreciate her guards. Maybe he\u2019d known she had a thing for him, Coop, and Dane, so he\u2019d decided to kill her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had this case on hold for a few weeks while Law and Riley aided in the search for the princess. Riley can do some amazing things with other people\u2019s satellites. The wreckage wasn\u2019t deep and the water is fairly clear in that part of the world. He narrowed the search to a hundred possible sites, and we\u2019ve been checking every single one of them, combing all those little islands. Law was going to take the plane up and go over that particular chain, but the government of Palau told us it\u2019s some sort of eco-sanctuary, and today was the day their scientists came out to check on birds and shit. They were not happy to see you. Apparently, you four are a plight on the delicate ecosystem. How many fucking pigs did you have to kill?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been hungry. He would fucking do it again. \u201cI want you back on the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on it. And I\u2019m on my way out to the palace right now. Lawson is on Koror attempting to keep the press in line, but you should know they are all over this story, and some of it isn\u2019t good, man.\u201d</p><p>He moved away from the shower. \u201cWhat do you mean? People are really that upset that I killed some pigs to survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dominic hesitated. Lan hated those nasty little pauses because he knew that whatever came next would be shitastic. \u201cIt\u2019s about Her Highness.\u201d</p><p>He felt himself go cold. \u201cWhat about Alea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, there it is. I thought you were going to keep up the professional pretense forever, but I was pretty sure something was going on there. So you three finally got the princess to come around. Good. She\u2019s going to need you.\u201d Dominic sounded satisfied, as though he\u2019d thrown out a bit of bait that had gotten a nice-sized bite.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d Lan didn\u2019t have the patience to play games.</p><p>\u201cThe press started out good. I mean, good as in everyone was worried about the princess, but somewhere along the way some asshole reporter picked up the story of her kidnapping and found three of the other girls that the Lennox brothers saved from the same brothel. Two of them wouldn\u2019t talk, but one has been all over the fucking media spilling about how the princess would watch them be tortured and do nothing to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t help.\u201d Lan found the words hard to grind out of his mouth. His vision was starting to go red. \u201cShe was a victim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, the press loves a juicy story, whether it\u2019s the truth or not, and they seem to want to make the princess the villain of this piece. Sells more copies of their rags. You know how it goes. No one loves the one percenters these days. And you three won\u2019t be kept out of it, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d What did the press want with them?</p><p>\u201cThey know your names. They\u2019ve been all over your family members. You don\u2019t have a family, but they\u2019ve been to the town where you grew up. Nix, you should know that they\u2019re asking all kinds of intrusive questions, making nasty assumptions.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t care less what they said about him. Alea was a different story. \u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d There was a knock on the door. Law Anders. \u201cYour boy is here. I\u2019ll catch you at the palace. We\u2019ll do a debrief there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. And you should know I\u2019m investigating the girl who\u2019s singing to the press. I hate to put a bunch of heat on a victim, but I don\u2019t buy her story and I don\u2019t like how much she seems to be enjoying her fifteen minutes. Riley\u2019s running some reports on her as we speak.\u201d</p><p>Lan opened the door to let Law Anders in, and it looked like the man had gotten what they needed. He was carrying a case that had to contain a nice shiny new set of guns. They\u2019d tried to save their own, but after getting wet and being exposed to the elements, Lan had preferred new ones. Not that they\u2019d needed them on the island. There it had felt better to have a spear in his hand. Now that they were back to reality, Lan couldn\u2019t wait to armor up because someone was still coming after his girl.</p><p>Law stalked in, setting the case on the bed as Lan finished up with Dominic. He hung up the phone and went straight for the SIG.</p><p>Law Anders took a step back. His suit jacket came open, and Lan noticed he was already armed to the teeth with two semis in shoulder holsters. \u201cHopefully they\u2019re adequate. It wasn\u2019t easy getting handguns on this godforsaken island. I had to have them imported. Can we get back to concrete and shit soon? All this tropical crap bugs me.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he was a peach, but he had good taste in guns. Lan felt the weight in his hand, a welcome friend. \u201cWhen\u2019s the plane getting here? And who\u2019s the pilot? You can\u2019t expect me to put her on another plane with some random asshat.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to put her on a plane at all, but the revelation about the press made it impossible to stay here. They needed to get her back to the palace where they could shelter her and start the damage control. No doubt, Tal would get his PR people on it soon, but the longer they hid from the press without floating a story of their own, the longer those reporters would repeat whatever the hell that stupid snitch told them.</p><p>Law gave him a sarcastic salute. \u201cI\u2019ll be flying that baby. The sheikh is having his private plane sent. It should be here in a couple of hours, and it\u2019s been under guard twenty-four seven. I\u2019ll check it out myself and take the controls. I\u2019m licensed to fly just about anything. We\u2019ll be back at the palace tomorrow morning, then Riley and Dominic will want a full report on everything that happened. Well, all the non-naked stuff. So, you going to give this whole sharing thing an actual go?\u201d</p><p>Lan heard the shower cut off and the sounds of Cooper and Dane talking softly to Alea. He thought about telling Law to mind his own fucking business, but there was something about the way he asked the question. And he remembered how close the guy had seemed with his brother. Even despite their dumbass fighting, he would bet those two boys had shared their toys a time or two.</p><p>\u201cYeah. We haven\u2019t made anything formal yet, but we\u2019re going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Law stepped up to the window and looked outside. \u201cWeird little country, Bezakistan. Back where I come from, me and Riley are kind of freaks. Throw Dominic in and we\u2019re just a parade of crazy. Women like it for a night, but they will jump right off the train when you try to make it permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looking?\u201d He was a little surprised at that. Law Anders looked to be a tough guy, the kind who wouldn\u2019t want to settle down.</p><p>Massive shoulders shrugged up and down. \u201cI want what everyone else has. I just can\u2019t have it on my own. I got wired wrong, I guess. Anyway, the plane should be here in a couple of hours. I\u2019m trying to find some extra security, but this place is full of like divers and shit. If I wanted to go swim with a fucking dolphin we would be set, but finding someone who knows how to keep the crowds back is a different prospect. The way I heard it, the press is on their way as we speak. Some of them were already set up here because it got leaked that the princess is staying here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door to the bathroom opened, and Alea emerged looking soft and sweet and vulnerable all wrapped up in her fluffy robe. Dane and Cooper came out after her. Dane wore a towel, but Coop had changed into the sweatpants the concierge had hustled up.</p><p>It was weird not being naked with her.</p><p>Lan watched as Alea moved into the suite. She was bundled up, but there was a hint of a smile on her face. She reached for Dane\u2019s hand as he walked up to her. Lan watched as their fingers tangled together and was surprised that he didn\u2019t feel a hint of jealousy. All of that emotion had burned off on the island as they had found their unique roles in her life and she\u2019d settled into her place as the sun in their sky. She was theirs, and they had to do everything they could to protect her. Including shielding her from the press.</p><p>Law softened around Alea, proving he wasn\u2019t as much of an asshole as he seemed. \u201cPrincess, your cousins are really happy you\u2019re alive. The queen has been beside herself.\u201d</p> <p>Alea nodded, pulling the lapels of her robe together tightly. \u201cIt was very good to talk to her. Thank you for everything you\u2019ve done in searching for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t want to be found, did you?\u201d Law asked the question almost sadly as though he understood.</p><p>Alea paused and sighed, her hand squeezing Dane\u2019s. \u201cI will only say that the island wasn\u2019t so bad. If you\u2019re ever going to have a plane go down, I would highly recommend the accommodations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost women would have gone crazy out there,\u201d Law said. \u201cBut you look like you bloomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, look at her less, buddy,\u201d Cooper said, crowding her other side.</p> <p>But Lan realized that Lawson Anders wasn\u2019t hitting on their woman. He was longing for what she represented. Warmth. Love. Acceptance. \u201cYou do look gorgeous, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She flushed beautifully. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so. Could someone order tea?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already done that. \u201cIt should be here any minute. I ordered tea and some snacks. It\u2019ll be good to get some carbs, you know? And Law here promises me that Tal is sending us the big bus. It\u2019s going to be first class all the way home.\u201d</p><p>Alea nodded, but he could see the strain on her face. She could probably still remember how it felt to have the plane plunge and to wonder if they were going to make it. Hell, he didn\u2019t want to get on the plane and he used to jump off the fuckers.</p><p>There was a knock at the door. The tea service. He hoped they had gotten the order right, and there were some Cokes, too. Because he didn\u2019t do dainty teacups and cucumber sandwiches.</p><p>Alea moved for the door.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ll get it,\u201d Lan said, blocking her.</p><p>\u201cI can get a door, Lan,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not this one.\u201d He moved to the door but she stayed right behind him. As he pulled the door back, there was a flash and the quick sound of a camera shutter going off at high speed.</p><p>\u201cPrincess! Princess, is it true you have three lovers? What happened on the island?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to comment on the accusation that you aided your kidnappers in torturing young girls in Colombia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, the world would love to know what you were wearing when the plane went down.\u201d</p><p>There was a mob of them with cameras and video equipment, the light coming from the hall nearly blinding him. They were vultures, every single one of them. Rage popped through his system, adrenaline flooding his veins. They had no right to be here.</p><p>A microphone was shoved into his face. \u201cAre you the guard? What are you getting paid to be the princess\u2019s lover? How many of you are there? How does it work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you bisexual?\u201d</p><p>The questions peppered against him like rapid gunfire. He reached for the first camera he saw, blocking the doorway to keep the fuckers off Alea. He could make damn sure these reporters didn\u2019t get at her again. They would have to get through him, and he was going to let them know that wouldn\u2019t be an easy task. He reared back a fist, anger nearly choking him as they shouted crap about the woman he loved.</p><p>Before he could connect, something jerked him back into the room.</p><p>\u201cShut that fucking door,\u201d Dane snarled, still grabbing his biceps.</p><p>Law jogged to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of this. You don\u2019t open this to anyone but me.\u201d</p><p>Cooper moved in and locked the deadbolt. Lan saw red. His heart pounded. His fists clenched. Fuck, he had to get control of himself. He would check on Alea, then he was going to take apart some reporters. He would rip a couple of heads off and mount them at the end of the hallway, and maybe the next set of vultures wouldn\u2019t be so eager to knock on their door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Dane pulled him back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it quietly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. They\u2019re reporters. Do you forget who we are? I don\u2019t just mean our names. Now we\u2019re both the princess\u2019s guards and her lovers. You can\u2019t beat the shit out of people anymore. Everything we do reflects on her. Ultimately, we represent the sheikh and his family. Let Law handle it.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He hadn\u2019t thought about that. He forced himself to calm down. Never once during his pursuit of Alea had he thought about the dark side of royalty being his problem if he actually caught her. This was her life, and if he wanted her, it had to be his, too. He would have to put up with all the questions, the reporters, and the constant speculation. Oh fuck... Dane was smart; he could handle it. Cooper was charming enough to slide by. But he\u2019d just about walked out into the hallway and started tearing reporters up. It would have all been caught on camera for the world to see. Shit!</p><p>Lan looked up, and Alea was staring right at him, her dark eyes burning a hole through him as though she knew exactly what he was thinking. \u201cLea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it\u2019s always going to be now.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t look him in the eyes. Her face had flushed, her hands trembling slightly. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to have a normal life if you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>His stomach sank. God, why hadn\u2019t he just slammed the door? \u201cI don\u2019t want a normal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just the start, Lan. They will come at you every day. They\u2019ll drag you down with me,\u201d she said, her voice tight.</p><p>\u201cLea, come on. Let\u2019s dry your hair.\u201d Cooper reached for her hand and started to lead her back to the bathroom.</p><p>She walked with him, her head held at that regal angle she used for state appearances.</p><p>Damn it. He started to go after her. He had to explain...what? That he was sorry he\u2019d nearly started a new scandal for the entire royal family and made things much worse for her?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Dane stood in his way. \u201cLet Coop handle her right now. You need to decide.\u201d</p><p>He hated the fact that Cooper was with her and not him. \u201cI nearly fucked everything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have known this was going to happen. You\u2019ve been guarding this family for over a year. You know how the press can be.\u201d</p><p>He did, but he\u2019d never been in the middle of it. He\u2019d never had all that attention focused on him.</p><p>Dane frowned. \u201cWhat did you think would happen? What do you think is going to happen when we marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to have to get a grip on my temper. But they said some horrible things about our girl. How can I not defend her?\u201d He needed to get a fucking grip and wrap his head around it all.</p><p>Dane took a long breath and held his hands up, backing away slightly. \u201cWe have to find new ways to defend her because lashing out will only make things worse. Sorry, man. I think we\u2019re all on edge. We need to back off and reconvene after we\u2019ve gotten her safely back to Bezakistan.\u201d</p><p>Lan nodded. He could still hear the reporters clamoring outside the door, and over it all, Law\u2019s shouts. \u201cI wish they\u2019d never found us.\u201d</p><p>Dane\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cMe, too, man. Me, too.\u201d</p><p>Alea felt numb as she was led into Tal\u2019s office. She\u2019d pretended to sleep all the way home, keeping her eyes closed and ignoring the conversations around her.</p><p>But all she could hear in her head was those reporters and all she could see was the look of horror on Lan\u2019s face as he\u2019d realized what he\u2019d really gotten mixed up in.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to read some of the press surrounding her disappearance, despite Dane and Cooper\u2019s attempts to prevent it.</p><p>They were calling her all sorts of names. And despite the fact that it had been tradition in Bezakistan for hundreds of years for brothers to share a wife, her men weren\u2019t being considered brothers. Because they shared no blood, the press seemed to think they could deem their relationship kinky rather than traditional and savage it.</p><p>And who had even told them they had a relationship in the first place? Who the hell was this palace source they kept talking to?</p><p>And the worst part was the girl from the brothel recounting all the ways Alea had failed. According to Brittany Hahn, she was worse than a coward. The girl was telling the world that Alea had actually participated in the other women\u2019s torture to spare herself. It was a lie, but she still saw those women in her nightmares, their eyes pleading with her to help. She hadn\u2019t tortured them, but she hadn\u2019t been able to save them either. Had she tried hard enough?</p><p>\u201cLea!\u201d Piper nearly ran across the space that separated them, throwing her arms around Alea, tears streaming down her face. \u201cLea, I thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>She returned the hug, but Alea felt like she was on autopilot. She\u2019d tried to think of any way to spare her men the pain of the hell they were all about to endure, the constant exposure to the vicious side of the press. But every road led back to one conclusion. They were better off without her.</p><p>Her cousins were standing around Tal\u2019s desk, all of them showing signs of the strain the last month must have placed on them. Rafe and Kade looked like they hadn\u2019t slept, and Tal had a grimness about him she hadn\u2019t seen since he\u2019d married his Piper.</p><p>Piper stepped back, smiling at the men who had filed in behind Alea. \u201cDane, Landon, Cooper. Thank you so much for taking care of her. I heard how you managed to land the plane and get her to safety. You\u2019re heroes.\u201d</p><p>They were her heroes. How could she drag them into her world? It had been so simple on the island, but this was reality, and she feared that none of them were really ready for what it would mean to be married to her. Perhaps if she\u2019d never been kidnapped, they would only have to deal with reporters taking pictures and asking intrusive questions about their love life. But now, these \u201cjournalists\u201d were out for blood and called her very morality into question. How long could the press ask these questions before Dane, Cooper, and Lan would get tired of comforting or defending her? How long before they wondered if the reports were true? She had no doubt they would stand by her, but they would get hurt. How long before they resented her for their loss of privacy?</p><p>Tal walked around shaking hands with her men. \u201cThey are indeed heroes. The royal family cannot repay this debt to you, gentlemen. I will only promise this, no matter what happens in the future, you will always find aid and shelter in this house. I consider you family now.\u201d</p><p>Alea let her eyes close briefly because she was about to blow everyone out of the water. Damn. Damn. Damn. She didn\u2019t want to do it, but she didn\u2019t see another way to ensure their happiness. She hadn\u2019t been able to help the women she\u2019d been trapped with, but she could help the men she loved.</p><p>She\u2019d known the minute they\u2019d been rescued, seen the speculative looks on the scientists\u2019 faces, that it wouldn\u2019t work. Not here. The island had been different. She\u2019d been able to let go. There was no pushing away the past here.</p><p>The men began talking among themselves, and Piper started ordering food, talking to the staff about a fine welcome home dinner. Alea drifted to the window, staring at the gardens.</p><p>But all she could see was that young woman\u2019s face. She\u2019d managed to pull up one of the many TV interviews Brittany Hahn had given to various media outlets. Apparently she\u2019d been taken to the same brothel Alea had been held in. Brittany had been on a spring break trip to Mexico when she\u2019d been taken for her youthful blonde beauty and sold into prostitution.</p><p>Alea didn\u2019t remember her. She\u2019d been one of a hundred girls Alea had been forced to watch be raped and beaten as part of her \u201ctraining.\u201d In the beginning, Alea had fought and screamed, but she\u2019d quickly learned that they took her defiance out on the girls she was watching and not her. Oh, they would slap her, beat her silly, but the real pain happened to those young women.</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t remember Brittany, the girl remembered her. And hated her. She\u2019d blamed Alea for her rape, claimed Alea loved watching others be hurt. She\u2019d called the Princess of Bezakistan nothing but a sadist and hinted that other girls had claimed Alea herself helped hurt them.</p><p>Why was she spreading lies? Why was this happening? Pain ripped through Alea. She needed...god, she didn\u2019t even know what she needed, but she couldn\u2019t stand the waiting anymore. And she knew damn well, she wasn\u2019t going to bring these men into her hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Piper was right. Dane, Landon, and Cooper were heroes. They had saved her, and what did they get in return? Cameras shoved in their faces and their lives ripped apart in the press.</p><p>She\u2019d seen that, too. The press had been busy, interviewing their families and the people in their hometowns, asking all kinds of intrusive questions.</p><p>Dane\u2019s BDSM leanings had been splashed across the papers, his military career coming into question again. His family had publically disowned him, even when they thought he\u2019d been lost in the crash. He\u2019d been labeled perverse by his ex-wife, who seemed to have taken special delight in detailing all his flaws.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s family had been inundated. As far as she could tell, they had been busy trying to keep reporters off the ranch.</p> <p>Only Landon had been spared since he didn\u2019t have family, but that wouldn\u2019t last. The hotel had proven that. They would be all over him, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the unrelenting pressure.</p><p>None of them should have to.</p><p>\u201cHow was the flight back?\u201d Piper asked, walking up beside her. \u201cI was worried that it would be hard on you.\u201d</p><p>Her men had done everything they could to make it safe. They really were the best. \u201cIt was fine. Mr. Anders is an excellent pilot.\u201d</p><p>Alea turned slightly and saw that all three of them were watching her even as they talked to her cousins. This was going to be so hard, but she had to do it. Their time on the island was over, and Brittany Hahn had been right about one thing. She really hadn\u2019t done anything to help those other girls. She should have fought harder, found a way out, but no, she\u2019d given into the drugs they\u2019d put her on. She\u2019d closed her eyes and just prayed to die.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t deserve the heroes who claimed to love her, and they definitely didn\u2019t deserve this pain. But it seemed like pain and heartache was all she was capable of giving them.</p><p>\u201cTal, can I speak with you privately?\u201d</p><p>Piper frowned, obviously upset, but Alea was resolute. After this was done, she was going to lock herself away and just try to stay out of the public eye.</p><p>Tal\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cOf course. Brothers, Piper, if you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and get everything ready in the board room,\u201d Rafe said. \u201cDominic Anthony is scheduled to arrive in the next hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d Kade offered. They took Piper\u2019s hands and led her out.</p> <p>Dane, Lan, and Cooper stayed right where they were.</p><p>\u201cI would really like to speak to Tal alone, please.\u201d She would explain her position to Talib. He would understand. He, more than the others, knew what it meant to be in the public spotlight.</p><p>\u201cLan, Coop,\u201d Dane began. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go and find the Anders brothers and get things set up. I want to get a full update as soon as Dominic lands.\u201d</p><p>They nodded reluctantly and left. Then she stood alone with Tal and Dane.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Talib. Completely alone.\u201d</p><p>Tal shook his head. \u201cNo, Lea. At least for now, you won\u2019t be alone. At least one of your guards must be with you, even in your locked rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem, sheikh.\u201d Dane stepped forward, his expression a bit grim as though he knew he was about to go into battle. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving into the princess\u2019s suite this evening. She won\u2019t ever be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Tal said, and there was no way to mask his sigh of relief. \u201cI\u2019ll call the contractors tomorrow. Her suite is too small for all four of you. We\u2019ll start the expansion plans as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>She was rapidly losing control. \u201cNo, Tal. They can\u2019t move in with me.\u201d</p><p>The room got very quiet as both men turned to her. It was obvious she had their full attention.</p><p>\u201cAlea, where did you think we would stay?\u201d Dane asked quietly, his voice icy cold. \u201cDid you think we would go back to our own rooms? Just meet in the middle for a little rendezvous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain yourself, cousin. The way I heard it, you\u2019ve settled your relationship with your men. Are you telling me you haven\u2019t?\u201d Tal asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not moving in with me. It\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d She couldn\u2019t quite meet Dane\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally? So yesterday in the shower was good-bye, was it, Lea?\u201d Dane asked.</p><p>\u201cCould you be a little more discreet?\u201d She couldn\u2019t help how her face flushed.</p><p>Dane towered over her. \u201cNot a chance, and it\u2019s going to get uglier. If you had wanted to keep this between the four of us, you shouldn\u2019t have brought your cousin into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the head of my family.\u201d And she was counting on the way things worked here in Bezakistan. They might be modern, but when it came right down to it, Tal made the decisions. If she could get him on her side, she would be home free and there was nothing any of the guys could do.</p><p>Dane seemed to grow a couple of inches as he watched her, his whole body going into battle mode. \u201cIs he? Let me tell you something, Alea, because I apparently wasn\u2019t clear. I am the head of this family since you seem determined to go old school with this. I\u2019ve been extremely patient so far, but you need to think about what you\u2019re doing and stop. Nothing has changed. We\u2019re together, and we will get through all of this together. As a family. Making decisions together. If you continue down the path I think you\u2019re taking, you\u2019re going to put me in a corner and you won\u2019t like how I fight my way out of it.\u201d</p><p>Tal had stepped back, frowning as he watched them.</p><p>She felt her anger starting to simmer. \u201cEverything has changed, Dane. You know it. You can\u2019t be so na\u00efve as to think that anything is the same. You were in the hotel room when the press arrived. The island was just a little vacation, a dream. It\u2019s time to wake up now.\u201d</p><p>His face opened up, pure surprise hitting him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Dane wouldn\u2019t understand. She knew exactly how this would go down if she tried to explain herself. He would never admit that this relationship wouldn\u2019t work. He would force the issue, and they would all be torn up and miserable. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have a relationship with you in the real world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? The real world? Because the island felt pretty fucking real to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. We had all been through something frightening, and we bonded over our shared survival. That was all it really meant,\u201d she lied. \u201cDane, you couldn\u2019t expect me to marry my guards.\u201d</p><p>Alea held in her tears. It had been everything to her. It had been the best time of her life. She would hold those memories to her heart forever.</p><p>Dane stepped up, not respecting anything so civilized as personal space. \u201cShared survival? We\u2019re just your guards? Yeah, that doesn\u2019t fly with me, baby. There\u2019s nothing on the books that states you have to marry another royal.\u201d</p><p>She steeled herself. God, she hated this. \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry anyone, but if I do, I will marry someone who\u2019s lived in my world and understands it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Piper understood this world when your cousins married her? She was a research assistant from Texas. She wasn\u2019t royal and she definitely wasn\u2019t rich. What the fuck is this really about, Alea?\u201d</p><p>How could she make him understand? \u201cDid you see what happened with Lan? He\u2019s going to get hurt. Do you know what\u2019s going on back in America? They\u2019re going after your families, Dane. We need to be realistic. We had a wonderful time. I will never forget it, but it can\u2019t be more than a fling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about all that sex, Alea? Is that the fling you mean? Should I remind you just how many ways we had you? And I don\u2019t have that family anymore, Lea. I have you, Lan, and Coop, and we will get through this together.\u201d He took a long breath. \u201cBaby, calm down. I know being back here and being hounded by reporters is a shock.\u201d</p><p>It was more than a shock. Tears clouded her vision. She turned to Talib because talking to Dane would get her nowhere. \u201cWould you please listen to me, cousin? I would like to make a formal request to have my security duty turned over to other guards. I will submit to any security detail you deem fit. I will cooperate with the investigators and I will live a quiet life that will bring no further scrutiny to our family.\u201d</p><p>The press\u2019s accusations could hurt her cousins. They had kept everything so quiet, and now all the ugliness was out in the open. What would her people think? There would be some who would view her as sullied. Some parts of the country were still quite backwards.</p><p>She turned back to Dane, her head held regally. \u201cDane, you have to understand that my cousin\u2019s throne and our entire family is judged based on our actions. Any scandal hurts us. Our traditions might seem odd to the outside world, but in many ways our people are very conservative. The very fact that I was abused will make some people view me differently.\u201d</p><p>Tal ran a hand across his scalp, ruining his perfect hair. \u201cLea, you can\u2019t think about them. They\u2019re the mountain people. The citizens in our cities won\u2019t see you differently. It\u2019s one region of the country. Everyone knows they\u2019re out of touch with modern ideals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re not completely out of touch with the media. They will hear the story and they can cause trouble. It will be worse when they find out about my affair. If I cut it off now and go into seclusion, I can mitigate the damage to all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be damage if you make it legal,\u201d Tal drawled. \u201cI rather assumed there would be another wedding. Did you plan to live with my cousin, in my palace, without offering her your name, Dane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Dane shot back. \u201cNone of us would do that, and you know it. It has always been our plan to properly marry her with full Bezakistani rites. We talked about marriage on the island, in fact. We respect this family and would never do a damn thing to dishonor it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t marry them.\u201d She knew what Tal wanted, but couldn\u2019t he see how wrong it was to bring the men she loved into their world, especially now when the press seemed intent on ripping her apart? \u201cTal, please try to understand. You would try to protect Piper.\u201d</p><p>A small smile crossed Tal\u2019s face. \u201cPiper is strong, Alea. And so are your men.\u201d</p><p>Dane tried to reach for her. \u201cLea, we don\u2019t need protection.\u201d</p><p>Which just went to prove that he could be na\u00efve. What if Brittany Hahn wasn\u2019t the only one who had resented Alea\u2019s \u201cprivileged\u201d treatment? What if more women came out and accused her of cowardice or outright collusion? How could they build a family when she was covered in scandal? \u201cI won\u2019t marry anyone.\u201d</p><p>Dane proved he knew their customs way better than she\u2019d given him credit for. \u201cYour Highness, I would like to make a formal declaration of intent to marry your cousin. I meant to do this later and with proper pomp and circumstance, but she\u2019s not giving me room for that.\u201d</p><p>A single eyebrow arched over Tal\u2019s right eye. \u201cReally? You want to put her in a corner like that?\u201d</p><p>Alea turned to Dane, her eyes widening. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to force me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>According to strict law, because she\u2019d been formally adopted into the royal family and bore their name, she was actually considered to be Talib\u2019s property. It was an old law, but still a valid one. Dane wasn\u2019t asking her to marry him. He was petitioning Talib to force the marriage.</p><p>\u201cI believe I mentioned you wouldn\u2019t like how I fought. And don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in this. I have no doubt Landon and Cooper are ready to sign the paperwork, too. We\u2019re not going to let your fear rip us apart.\u201d He took a long breath and reached for her. \u201cLea, I don\u2019t want to do it this way. Let\u2019s go somewhere quiet and talk this out, you, me, Lan, and Coop. We\u2019ll hash this out.\u201d</p><p>So calm. So reasonable. And he\u2019d just threatened to treat her like property. \u201cI am trying to do what\u2019s right for all of us. You can\u2019t think for a second that my cousin is going to force me to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will admit, I would prefer not to,\u201d Tal commented.</p><p>\u201cBut he will because I haven\u2019t played my best card yet, baby. I\u2019m begging you not to make me do this.\u201d Dane spoke to him, but never took those predatory eyes off her.</p><p>His best card? What the hell? Her blood was pounding through her body. She\u2019d been treated like a sack of meat before, and she wasn\u2019t about to let anyone curtail her freedom. She\u2019d been willing to offer it up. She\u2019d meant what she said to Tal. She was willing to hire another guard and to submit to all of their security protocols. She would do it because it helped her family and it protected her men, but she would be damned if Dane and Tal decided her fate.</p><p>\u201cAlea, what is this really about?\u201d Tal asked, his voice softening marginally. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on here. This is between you and your men, truly, but you\u2019ve forced me into this situation. I believe Dane when he says he doesn\u2019t want to push the marriage rites on you, but I also think he will do it. Don\u2019t put me in a position where I have to choose between my family and my very good friends. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI won\u2019t marry them. After this, I won\u2019t even talk to them again.\u201d The words sounded stupid and stubborn, but she couldn\u2019t give in. They deserved good lives with someone less broken, with someone who wouldn\u2019t always have a horde of reporters trailing after her, intent on ruining her life\u2014and everyone around her.</p><p>\u201cDid you or did you not sleep with these men?\u201d Tal asked, though she was certain he knew the answer.</p><p>Alea knew immediately that her sweet cousin had left the building. This was the Royal Sheikh of Bezakistan addressing her as the head of her family, and she felt like she was five years old all over again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see that it matters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt matters, cousin. I will not ask again.\u201d</p><p>She felt her fists clench. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair. It\u2019s not like you, Rafe, and Kade were pure on your marriage bed. No one expected you to marry that first girl the three of you shared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about us, cousin. This is about you. You gave your body and, I believe, your heart to Dane, and yet you will not do him the courtesy of talking to him. It is a disgrace and not worthy of the woman I know you to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you don\u2019t know me as well as you thought.\u201d It was nothing less than the truth, but her heart broke at the thought.</p><p>Tal sighed, a weary sound. \u201cPlease, Lea. Don\u2019t make me turn them out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s for the best.\u201d God, she felt the burn of Dane\u2019s furious stare all over her and wanted this to be over so she could lock herself in her rooms and scream and cry and start to mourn them.</p><p>Tal turned to Dane. \u201cI am sorry, old friend. I cannot force her to my will. This scandal will pass. The family will survive. The press will turn around when the new baby is born.\u201d</p><p>Dane had gone cold as ice, his whole body perfectly still. His voice was frigid. \u201cAre you talking about your child, sheikh, or mine?\u201d</p><p>Alea felt like someone had punched her in the gut. She turned to Dane, her feet unsteady. Oh, god, she\u2019d thought about it, but it was like a little whisper in the back of her mind. She\u2019d known that she could become pregnant. How many weeks had gone by? She\u2019d lost count. Time seemed to flow differently on the island, but now it was speeding up like a carnival ride. It was making her sick.</p><p>Talib had gone an angry red. \u201cMy cousin is pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Alea shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>Was she?</p><p>Dane\u2019s smile was that of a man who had just tossed down the winning hand when everyone had thought he was played out. \u201cWe were on the island for over a month. She never had her period.\u201d</p><p>Oh god. She hadn\u2019t even thought of that until now.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t notice,\u201d Tal tried.</p><p>\u201cI was inside her every day, sheikh. I would have noticed. We didn\u2019t use protection. She\u2019s pregnant by one of us, but I assure you, we will all claim the child. We believed she loved us and had pure intentions. We always intended to marry her with full respect to her culture. I understand that you shouldn\u2019t have been placed in this position, sheikh, but you should understand that I have no intention of allowing my child to grow up without his fathers. If you choose not to honor my rights as the man who impregnated her, then Cooper, Landon, and I will be forced to petition your courts to have our rights recognized. Since she was in a relationship with the three of us, according to your laws, we all have rights to the child.\u201d</p><p>Alea felt sick. She managed to stay on her feet.</p><p>Tal was still talking, his voice rough. \u201cIf the doctors confirm a pregnancy, then the marriage will take place as soon as possible. We\u2019ll keep it private, but afterward, we will announce the union to the press. In a few months, we\u2019ll publicize the princess\u2019s pregnancy.\u201d Tal turned to her. \u201cI have no choice. You were right about our people. We could handle an affair. The heat would be on us for a few months, but we would survive the scandal. We cannot handle a princess with an illegitimate child. This isn\u2019t England or America where people just accept royalty and celebrities as human. If you don\u2019t marry, they will blame me for not protecting my family. It will weaken my position. Did they rape you?\u201d</p><p>Honesty would be her death knell. Alea knew it. Yet she couldn\u2019t lie. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you made your bed, cousin, and you will lie in it. I know it\u2019s not fair, but there are conservative factions in this country that would do anything to topple my throne and set us all back a thousand years. I cannot allow that to happen. In this, I must be the sheikh and not your cousin. I have to keep my throne stable for everyone in Bezakistan. You will marry them if you\u2019re pregnant. I would offer to allow you to marry someone of your choice and pay off these men, but I have a feeling they cannot be bought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for anything, sheikh,\u201d Dane confirmed, his face grim but resolute. \u201cWe will not back down and we are united in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs brothers should be.\u201d Tal reached out and shook Dane\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll sit down and talk about all the details this evening after dinner. Alea, I\u2019ll send the doctor up to you in a bit. You should rest until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me, Talib. You can\u2019t do this to them.\u201d Her voice sounded small and lost.</p><p>\u201cYou chose to sleep with them, knowing how they felt. You chose to not use protection. And now you\u2019re throwing a fit because there were consequences to your actions. I have to take charge because you\u2019re acting like a child and not a woman about to become a mother. You\u2019re still clinging to the pain and the guilt like they\u2019re security blankets. I know because I did the same thing, but I cannot allow it now. I\u2019m not stupid, Alea. I know your refusal has something to do with what happened to you, and I am so sorry it is being dragged up again, but your time to hide is over. You have to face what happened and decide if you are going to allow it to defeat you or if you will grow beyond it and move on. I love you, my cousin. I pray you can heal and embrace the future.\u201d He walked away, pulling out his chair and sitting behind that big desk where his fathers once worked.</p><p>\u201cTal?\u201d She\u2019d just lost something precious and she hadn\u2019t meant to. Tears threatened.</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to look up. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed, Alea. I have to prepare for the meeting with the investigators and then I must start the paperwork for your marriage. It\u2019s a matter of state, after all.\u201d</p><p>She felt tired. So weary. She\u2019d been trying to protect them, but it had blown up in her face.</p><p>Dane wouldn\u2019t look at her. He kept his attention on Tal. \u201cI will see you in the meeting, sheikh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCousin, please. You\u2019re family now, Dane. Address me as Tal or cousin as is your right and my privilege. Let Cooper and Landon know I expect the same from them.\u201d</p><p>Well, it was great that they were getting along. She felt more on the outside than she\u2019d ever felt in her life.</p><p>\u201cAlea, we\u2019ll see you in our room. I believe you\u2019ll find one of Talib\u2019s personal guards waiting outside to escort you. Obey him. And I wouldn\u2019t attempt to lock us out if I were you. I will kick the door in. This wasn\u2019t the way I wanted to start our marriage.\u201d Dane walked away without looking back.</p><p>Alea watched him go and then went to join her guard, her heart heavier than ever. She placed a hand on her belly. She could pretend all she liked, but she knew the truth. She could tell herself that she had been trying to protect them, but she\u2019d really been protecting herself. It had been easy on the island because she didn\u2019t have to deal with reality. She could simply be. No future. No past.</p><p>But the future was knocking at her door, and she couldn\u2019t lock it out.</p><p>\u201cI understand the impulse to push them away, Alea,\u201d Tal said from his desk. \u201cI really do. I thought it would be best to push Piper away. I thought I was too damaged for her, too dark. She was far smarter than I was. I wasn\u2019t too dark for her. That broken part of me was no match for her love. Her love was far stronger than any torture I\u2019d ever endured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t getting savaged by the press when you married Piper. Would you put her through this, Tal?\u201d</p><p>Her cousin\u2019s eyes grew misty, and he took a long breath. \u201cYes. I wouldn\u2019t have said it at the time, but now I know the truth. If you love those men, if you want to share a life with them, then you owe them the chance to stand by you. Would you walk out if one of them was in trouble this way?\u201d</p><p>God no. She wouldn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t. But she hadn\u2019t given them a chance. \u201cNo. I love them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen honor them by sharing all of your life. This is marriage, Alea. It\u2019s good and bad and everything in between, and it only works if you\u2019re in it together. Learn from my mistakes. Don\u2019t waste a minute of your time. Go upstairs and see the doctor and wait for your men. Talk to them. Be honest.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but couldn\u2019t seem to make her feet move.</p><p>\u201cAlea?\u201d Tal was softer now. \u201cAlea, do you need help?\u201d</p><p>They had been asking for over a year. Do you need help? She\u2019d seen it as pity then, viewed her silence as strength. But all she\u2019d done was shut out the people who loved her and closed herself off. \u201cYes, Talib. I believe I do. I would very much like to see the counselor again. If you could make the appointments, I would appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I can have her here this evening.\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cLea, I love you. I know where you are. I don\u2019t want this life for you.\u201d</p><p>This life she\u2019d been living could hardly be called a life at all because it allowed for no love, no future, just an endless stream of meaningless todays with no tomorrows. The past was an anchor that never allowed her to move on.</p><p>This was the life of a victim. But Piper\u2019s words of wisdom came back to her again. Suddenly she realized that her cousins\u2019 wife was right. She could choose. She could move from victim to survivor. Her choice. Her rules. She could defeat the bastards who had stolen her innocence by refusing to allow them to steal her future.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want it either.\u201d How long had it been since she\u2019d asked herself what she wanted? She wanted her men. She wanted this baby, and suddenly she began counting days and was almost sure that she was pregnant. What they had found on that island couldn\u2019t possibly have been left there. No. The love they had made had purpose and meaning, and she was full.</p><p>Alea rushed to her cousin and threw her arms around him like she had when she\u2019d been a child.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Alea.\u201d Tal held on to her, his arms tightening and his voice shaking. \u201cI know I call you cousin, but you\u2019re my sister. Welcome home.\u201d</p><p>Alea cried because she\u2019d been gone for so, so long.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Dane forced his feet to move, but he couldn\u2019t really feel them. He couldn\u2019t feel anything but this horrible aching knot in his gut. The scene with Alea played through his brain like a horror movie. Yeah, he\u2019d gotten what he wanted, but he didn\u2019t like the price he\u2019d been forced to pay.</p><p>He\u2019d hated the look in her eyes when he\u2019d shown her how far he would go. He was going to have to start his marriage by forcing his bride to a wedding. God, he\u2019d never imagined it would play out this way.</p><p>He stalked across the marbled floors of the palace, well aware that everyone was giving him a wide berth. It was a damn good thing because he really wanted to take someone\u2019s head off.</p><p>He\u2019d realized a few days ago that Alea was very likely pregnant, but he\u2019d wanted to give it time, to be sure, before they had to deal with the fact that they were on an island with no medical care. He\u2019d been standing by the fresh water pool Lan had discovered, watching her smile and swim and kiss his partners and he\u2019d just...known. She was carrying a child.</p><p>When they\u2019d been rescued, he\u2019d planned to keep his mouth shut until she figured it out. It was a woman\u2019s right to tell her men that she was pregnant, giving them the gift of a family.</p><p>He\u2019d been so happy. Something deep inside him had settled as though he\u2019d found a piece to his puzzle that had been wrenched out of place and had finally been made right. His child. His, Lan, and Coop\u2019s with Alea. And she\u2019d looked perfectly horrified at the idea of being pregnant. Like it was her worst nightmare.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with his eyes? He stopped, the room turning blurry.</p><p>Fuck all. He was not going to cry. He didn\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cDane? Is Lea coming to the meeting?\u201d Cooper asked, his voice drifting up from behind Dane.</p><p>Dane took a long breath and banished the unwanted emotion. He should have stayed calm, should have given her more time, but the idea that she thought they would be better apart had made him insane. Dane turned. \u201cNo. She\u2019s gone to her rooms. We can fill her in afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she would want to come.\u201d Lan joined them in the vestibule that led from the residences to the section of the palace that held staff offices and conference rooms. The early evening air filled the vestibule, and he could smell the scent of jasmine from the gardens where he\u2019d wanted to take Alea and propose when the time was right. They\u2019d talked about it, the three of them. It was traditional for the royal family to become engaged in view of the gardens. The gardens were blessed once a year and had been for the last two hundred years. They were said to be a lucky place for love and peace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Coop stopped, his eyes widening. \u201cWhat the hell happened to put that look on your face?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d lost his temper, and now he had to tell his brothers how screwed they were. \u201cWe had an argument.\u201d</p><p>Lan\u2019s jaw became a harsh line, his arms going over his chest. \u201cShe changed her mind about us. We\u2019re back here now, and she doesn\u2019t want to be with a bunch of broken down old soldiers, right?\u201d</p><p>His brain had gone there at first, too. He couldn\u2019t blame Lan. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem, but she did ask to have us removed as her guard and basically told Talib that it would be best if she didn\u2019t see us again.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be hard since she\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>When had Cooper figured that out?</p><p>Lan\u2019s jaw dropped. His eyes bugged out. \u201cLea\u2019s pregnant? How the fuck did that happen?\u201d</p><p>Cooper shook his head. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk about eggs and sperm. When three boys love a girl very much...\u201d</p><p>Dane stopped Cooper in his tracks. \u201cThis is serious, Coop. She really was trying to send us away.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper shook his head. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t changed her mind. The press is just freaking her out.\u201d</p><p>Lan\u2019s calm broke, and a hopeless look filled his eyes. \u201cI caused this, didn\u2019t I? I don\u2019t know anything about this royal shit. I\u2019ll just screw everything up. I almost did in Koror. I love her, man. I never loved anyone before, but I love her so damn much. I don\u2019t want to wreck her life. And I don\u2019t see what we can do. If she won\u2019t marry us, we can\u2019t force her.\u201d</p><p>Cooper\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cNo, but the sheikh can. I read up a little on their laws, and I bet Dane did, too. The sheikh can force members of his family to marry if he deems it critical to either state or familial relations. Alea being pregnant and unwed in this part of the world would be a huge scandal that could rock this palace. Shit, Dane. Did you pull him into this?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, that was where he\u2019d probably screwed up. \u201cShe didn\u2019t leave me a choice since she went to Tal without talking to us first. I\u2019m not going to be eliminated from our child\u2019s life. And she needs us, too.\u201d</p><p>Lan stood a little taller. \u201cDamn straight she does. I can learn the press stuff. I\u2019ll take a class or something. \u2018Learning How to Not Pound a Fuckwad 101.\u2019 Sign me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see your notes from that class, Lan.\u201d Cooper turned back to Dane. \u201cYou were right to bring Tal into this. She\u2019s stubborn as hell. This way she can\u2019t refuse and tell herself she\u2019s doing it all for us. I think she would have fought to protect us, even if it hurt her.\u201d</p> <p>Knowing Cooper and Lan were standing beside him gave him great strength. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let her go into this alone, but I\u2019m worried that she won\u2019t accept us now. We can force her to marry us, but we can\u2019t make her like it. Damn it, Coop, she\u2019s had all her choices taken away before. I hate to be the man who does that to her again. How the hell did she find out about how bad the press has gotten? I tried to protect her from it. I didn\u2019t want her to know what was going on with our families. How are your folks faring in all this?\u201d</p><p>Cooper was the one with something to lose. Dane couldn\u2019t care less if the press inconvenienced his father, but Cooper was still close to his family, and he\u2019d heard the press had been harassing them.</p><p>A low laugh escaped Cooper\u2019s throat. \u201cAre you kidding? Have you met Colorado ranchers before? My momma met those reporters at the gate with a shotgun in her hands, and my brothers decided it would be fun to drive the herd their way. Said they\u2019d never seen a bunch of city folks run so fast. And they want to be invited to the wedding so the guest list could get big, but I can\u2019t let Momma down. Not just because she\u2019s already bought a dress, but also because she still scares me a little.\u201d</p><p>There was a long laugh, and Dane looked back at Tal, who was walking toward them. He\u2019d been so grim before, but now there was a light in his eyes. \u201cRest assured, Cooper, that your family is more than welcome here. I can\u2019t wait to meet them.\u201d</p><p>Cooper reached out and shook Tal\u2019s hand. \u201cI thank you for that. And when the time comes, I\u2019ll consult with the kitchen staff because my parents don\u2019t eat anything that hasn\u2019t been fried and smothered in gravy. Now, do you happen to know if you have a battering ram handy because I suspect our fianc\u00e9e is currently barricading herself in her suite as we speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some climbing equipment. I can scale the balcony. The doors into her room are about half glass. I can cut through it and be in the room in about a minute and a half,\u201d Lan said with utter confidence. He shrugged a little when he noticed everyone was staring at him. \u201cI think about things at night. Do you really think she\u2019s going to lock us out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not believe so,\u201d Tal said. \u201cI think the possibility of her pregnancy has made Alea rethink her position.\u201d</p><p>So she knew she needed a father for her baby. It wasn\u2019t all he wanted from her, but a step in the right direction. He still had to wonder if she would always resent him for forcing the marriage. Would he always be just another man who bent her to his will?</p> <p>\u201cShe asked to start seeing the counselor again.\u201d Tal was practically beaming.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to talk about her captivity?\u201d Dane had tried every sneaky trick in the book to get her to open up. He wanted it to be him she talked to. He was a selfish bastard, but he was also deeply in love. He would take what he could get.</p><p>Fuck. He would take her any way he could and pray that he could make her love him. He\u2019d started their relationship with the firm belief that she\u2019d have to take him as he was because he couldn\u2019t change. But now he realized that he would. He refused to be another man who controlled her. All his life he\u2019d needed that control, craved it, but he needed her more. He needed to be a husband and father more than he needed to be a Dom.</p><p>\u201cIf you gentlemen would care to join us? We\u2019ve got everything set up and we\u2019ve found some interesting information,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>Dane joined his partners and walked into the conference room, the knot still in his gut.</p><p>Alea sat on the sofa in her living room, looking out the window as night began to fall. Pinks and oranges lit up the sky, and she took it in, feeling more settled than she had in years. All the time she\u2019d been held in that horrible brothel, she\u2019d wanted to come back to this place, to this room. When she\u2019d made it home, she locked herself in for days at a time, refusing all company. She\u2019d sat in this room time and time again, looking for safety and peace and finding none because rooms themselves didn\u2019t bring such gifts.</p><p>People did. Love did. She\u2019d been looking for something around her that could fix her when, all along, the power to heal had been deep inside her. Asking Tal to call the counselor had been a decision that only she could make. A decision to really live. A decision to be brave. She could be hurt again. Or her men could be hurt. The people she loved could die. Life had no guarantees.</p><p>But she could control allowing herself to love, to build a future and to fight for it. She could choose to face whatever future came with Dane, Cooper, and Landon, as well as the babies they had. She could choose to love them and be the best wife and mother possible.</p><p>And it was certain now. The doctor had just left. She was pregnant.</p><p>She took a long breath and waited. How long would their meeting take? She knew she could probably walk in and take part, but she didn\u2019t want to sit across the table from Dane with all that nastiness between them unresolved, and the last thing she wanted to do was have the discussion in front of her cousins and the investigators. She had already put Dane in that position once. She wouldn\u2019t do it again.</p><p>She would be patient and wait until she could close them off from the world and tell them\u2014all three of them\u2014how she felt. She would share how scared she was. She would tell them how wrong she\u2019d been to try to cut them out because now she knew that a family faced things together even when it hurt. Her job wasn\u2019t to shield them. It was to stand beside them, to hold hands and weather all the storms.</p><p>She would tell them she loved them so much.</p><p>\u201cPrincess?\u201d Her temporary guard had opened the door to her living area. He stepped through, looking young and so very serious.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The guard bowed slightly in deference to her. He seemed deeply solicitous toward females. As they had moved through the palace, he had been courteous to every female they had encountered. It had endeared the young man to her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man here to see you. He\u2019s your cousin\u2019s husband, Oliver Thurston-Hughes. I\u2019ve made sure he doesn\u2019t have any weapons. Should I tell him to go?\u201d</p><p>Oliver was here? She winced a little. She was going to have to apologize for destroying his plane. She doubted it would have crashed if she hadn\u2019t been in it. Oliver\u2019s family was ridiculously wealthy, but they would miss a plane. \u201cNo, not at all. Please show him in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I stay with you?\u201d the guard asked.</p><p>Alea shook her head. Her rooms were the only place she was going to be allowed any privacy for a while. She wasn\u2019t going to give it up. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. He\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>Oliver walked through, his face a dull red. He was a little disheveled, his normally perfect suit lacking a tie and his dress shirt slightly wrinkled. \u201cLea, thank goodness you\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>She tried to give him her best smile, but he wasn\u2019t the man she really wanted to see. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Oliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right? The guard was rather thorough in his pat down.\u201d Oliver smoothed down his shirt.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to explain that there was very likely still some crazy person out there who seemed to want her dead. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. I think Tal is just a little touchy right now. Now why are you here? Have you been here the whole time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went back home for a bit, but Talib asked Yasmin to come back to the palace once the horrible news reports began. I don\u2019t know what that terrible girl thinks she\u2019s going to get out of this.\u201d</p><p>She led him back to the sitting area. \u201cBrittany? I\u2019m sure she thinks she\u2019ll either get some closure or some money for her side of the story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should sue her. Yasmin has been representing the family on some news channels. I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019m rather worried she enjoys the fame a bit much.\u201d</p><p>Yas had always enjoyed attention. She\u2019d done some crazy things to get it. Alea had hoped she was over that.</p><p>Oliver was suddenly invading her space, hugging her close. \u201cGod, I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am. I was heartbroken. Lea, you were on my plane when it crashed. That was supposed to be me and Yasmin. I can\u2019t tell you how hard it\u2019s been knowing I caused this.\u201d</p><p>Alea tried to politely put some distance between them while reassuring him. \u201cOliver, this was about me. I\u2019m the one they\u2019re trying to kill.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, stepping back. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so. We\u2019ve been working with your investigators. It\u2019s why we came back here a few days ago. My brother got an e-mail after the plane went down. It said they wanted to take down all of the aristocracy, that our time was done. Yasmin was so upset by it that my brother gave her half a million pounds to upgrade security in all the homes and at the building where the charity is housed. How can we ever make it up to you? I shouldn\u2019t have allowed you to traipse off like that.\u201d</p><p>Allowed it? Something was tickling at the back of her mind. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Oliver. And I think it worked out for the best. If you and Yas had been on that plane, I doubt you would have survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, too. How exactly did you manage to escape? When I heard the plane went down over a remote part of the Pacific, I was sure you would drown. Or if you managed to survive the crash, you would likely die of exposure.\u201d</p><p>She shivered a little knowing how close she\u2019d come. It was funny, even afterward she hadn\u2019t had bad dreams about the crash. She\u2019d trusted her men implicitly. She\u2019d never really thought she would die. \u201cWe got on quite well, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know how many nights I sat up thinking about all the ways you could have died. I dreamed about sharks a lot. It\u2019s a bloody miracle you\u2019re alive.\u201d His voice shook a bit.</p><p>\u201cWell, I had three former special ops guys in my corner. They\u2019re kind of amazing.\u201d They had been calm and cool, thinking only of saving her. \u201cThey weren\u2019t about to let me die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them had to have known how to fly a plane, thank goodness. According to the news, the pilot killed himself and poisoned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we were lucky. The pilot wasn\u2019t counting on four of us splitting the wine. The sedative wasn\u2019t as effective as it could have been if it had just been me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr me and Yasmin.\u201d He turned his face to her, a grim expression darkening his eyes. \u201cYou have to know how much I\u2019ve always cared for you.\u201d</p><p>She was not going there. \u201cI\u2019ve always liked you too, Oliver. But I certainly know that I\u2019m never going to drink that particular brand of wine again. What was the name? Vallee d\u2019Harmonie. I did not find it harmonious.\u201d</p><p>Of course, she wouldn\u2019t be drinking anything for a while. At least nine months. And breast feeding time. She would want that. She would want to hold her baby, rocking and feeding the precious bundle of joy. She could imagine one of her men would bring the baby to her and they would talk quietly while she nursed. That would be harmonious.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>Alea looked up, pulled from her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the wine?\u201d Oliver leaned forward, his body a study in tension. \u201cWhat did you call the wine?\u201d</p><p>What had she said? \u201cI might not remember it right. It was a red. I just briefly looked at the bottle, but it translated to \u2018Harmony Valley.\u2019 I\u2019ve never heard of the vineyard before.\u201d</p><p>His face went white. \u201cOh, god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oliver, are you all right?\u201d His hands started to shake.</p> <p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard of the vineyard because the wine isn\u2019t on the market yet. It\u2019s one of my family\u2019s new ventures. We had the first batch brought in the week before the crash. I had it shipped out here because we were going to gift it to your cousins for Piper\u2019s coronation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she put it on the plane as a surprise for you and the pilot used it because it was convenient.\u201d That had to be it. Except the hostess had said that the pilot had brought it on board.</p><p>Oliver put a hand over his face, nearly moaning his words. \u201cIt was in our room that night. I joked with Yas that she wouldn\u2019t be able to drink it for another eight months. She wasn\u2019t in bed early that morning. I thought she\u2019d gone to say good-bye to you, but she didn\u2019t, did she?\u201d</p><p>Nausea washed over her. \u201cNo. Oliver, was it your idea for me to take the plane and go to Australia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The idea never even occurred to me. I actually argued against it when Yas brought it up. I didn\u2019t think you should go off on your own, but she was so insistent. She\u2019s been...unstable lately, very emotional and angry. I haven\u2019t quite known what to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you cheat on me with my whore bitch cousin?\u201d</p> <p>Alea gasped and whirled to the sound of that voice, completely startled as Yasmin entered the room, lifted a gun, and fired.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Cooper sat down and wished he could think of a damn thing to say to get that dark look off Dane\u2019s face. He\u2019d done the right thing. It was what Coop would have done himself. Alea needed to know they would never leave her. They would fight for her, even if she was the one they had to fight.</p><p>A massive man in a three-piece, charcoal-gray Armani suit stood at the front of the room. He was impressive from head to toe, every inch of his six foot seven inch muscled frame encased in what had to be a couple thousand dollars\u2019 worth of designer handmade wool. Cooper had to give it to him. Dominic Anthony made an impression. If he hadn\u2019t known what the man\u2019s profession was, he would have immediately thought gangster, and not the kind who followed orders. Oh, no, Dominic Anthony would be the one tasking his soldiers to kill. He had pitch-black hair and some of the darkest eyes Cooper had ever seen\u2014and he didn\u2019t just mean their color.</p><p>\u201cThanks for coming on such short notice, gentlemen.\u201d Dominic had a deep authoritative voice to go along with his intimidating physique. \u201cI know you just got off the plane, but I think it\u2019s important we go over some of the things Riley has uncovered in the last couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means. Tell us,\u201d Talib insisted, taking his seat between his brothers. \u201cI want my cousin to feel safe as soon as possible. She\u2019s getting married in the next few weeks. I would like to have some confidence that her wedding will be peaceful. We\u2019ll need added security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle it,\u201d Dane said, frowning. He was such a control freak. He wasn\u2019t thinking at all.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll need to handle Lea,\u201d Coop shot back.</p> <p>Dane had been married. Did he not remember everything that went into a wedding? Coop had been in the wedding party of three of his brothers\u2019 weddings, and they had all been nearly comatose by the end of it. This was a damn royal wedding to boot, one they had to throw together in a few weeks. Cooper could foresee all kinds of trouble. Alea was being forced to the altar. They\u2019d have to spend long hours convincing her that they could handle being her husbands. He had no doubt about how they would accomplish that. In bed. At least that made him smile.</p><p>\u201cI think we can handle security for our own wedding,\u201d Lan said.</p><p>\u201cAre you planning on standing at the altar covered in handguns?\u201d Coop asked.</p><p>Lan shrugged. \u201cNot just handguns. I was going to add a P-90 and some knives, too. I feel naked without them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be covered in firearms in our wedding pictures,\u201d Dane said, his lips curving up in the first smile Coop had seen on him all day. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Dominic sighed, those dark eyes rolling slightly. It was obvious the man was not impressed with their banter. \u201cIf the three of you are done making wedding plans?\u201d He turned to his two partners. \u201cThis shit is so not happening with us. If we find a chick, it\u2019s going to be no muss, no fuss. It\u2019s Vegas or nothing. Now, let\u2019s move on. Sheikh, we\u2019ve hit a brick wall with the whole Caymans account thing. I sent Law and Riley to the island where they canvassed the banks, and no one was talking. I tried bribes, but those are well-trained employees. Or they\u2019re terrified of the people they work for. Even if the clients are criminals, if something came out about secret accounts, the mob and the cartels would not be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told us you had some good news,\u201d Dane said, his jaw tight.</p><p>\u201cI have some news about the girl who\u2019s on the news right now.\u201d He looked down at his file. \u201cBrittany Hahn. She\u2019s a twenty-two year old from San Bernadino. She was partying in Tijuana during spring break a couple of years ago when she was taken by the same group that was hired to acquire Alea. I\u2019ve done a little more background on these thugs. They\u2019re tied to a cartel in Colombia. Real entrepreneurs, those guys. They\u2019re diversifying. This particular cartel has its hands in cocaine, slavery, and kidnap for fun and profit. It\u2019s a new enterprise that\u2019s starting to become more popular. They take high value targets like celebrities and upper-level businessmen, then they ransom them back to their families or businesses. Let me tell you, if you\u2019ve got money, you don\u2019t walk around parts of South America without ransom insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my cousin wasn\u2019t taken from South America,\u201d Kade said.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I believe this was a kidnap for hire all the same,\u201d Dominic said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone over and over everything, and it\u2019s the only thing that makes sense,\u201d Riley explained, taking over. \u201cIf she\u2019d been taken for use in the brothel, then she would have been raped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlea was raped,\u201d Cooper stated grimly. \u201cMaybe not physically, but she was violated all the same.\u201d</p><p>If Burke and Cole Lennox hadn\u2019t already killed the motherfuckers and burned down that house, Cooper would be on his way to Colombia.</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Riley nodded. \u201cBut nevertheless if the purpose of her kidnapping was to use her as a prostitute, she would not have been discovered fully intact, so to speak. So the question then is, why was she taken at all? And who was paying for her upkeep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume someone was going to buy her,\u201d Dane surmised, his hands tightening into fists. \u201cAnd they were holding her for this asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cPut yourself into the head of a man who would purchase a female for his own use. We\u2019re not talking about D/s, but true criminal slavery. Still, the owner\u2019s impulse would be very similar to what a real Dom would feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossessive.\u201d Cooper knew exactly what he was talking about. They all found the possessive instinct at first with Alea. \u201cAny man who would want to buy a virgin is going to be possessive and territorial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t leave her there for long. He wouldn\u2019t leave her training to someone else,\u201d Lan added. \u201cI know I wouldn\u2019t. And the so-called training they gave her was mostly psychological torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they got her hooked on drugs,\u201d Cooper added. He hated the thought of his Alea strung out and aching. They had used the drugs to keep her calm and quiet and to make her dependent. Alea was strong. He could imagine she\u2019d given the fuckers hell in the beginning. \u201cDo you think they would do that at some buyer\u2019s request?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, especially not heroin. That\u2019s not cheap,\u201d Dominic said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they had a buyer lined up for Alea at all. These are not the type of men who allow for installment plans. But they do love a little blackmail. I have a different theory of what happened. I believe the princess was kidnapped and that the men had help from an insider who plotted to draw Alea out, then help to urge the sheikh to pay the ransom as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Tal shook his head. \u201cI never got a ransom.\u201d</p><p>Dominic leaned forward. \u201cAh, yes, but from the kidnappers\u2019 point of view, why simply take money from the victim\u2019s family when they could first blackmail the person who set up the abduction? Once they bled their \u2018cohort\u2019 dry, they could always come to you with an exorbitant ransom request. And by doing it this way, they don\u2019t have to give their conspirator any of the promised kickback. They simply could have cut them out altogether or killed them. Either way, they\u2019re not sharing the fat ransom. So the longer they kept your cousin, the more likely you would be to pay an outrageous sum to get her back. In the meantime, they were busy getting paid by the same dirtbag who aided them in her kidnapping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the Lennox brothers found her first,\u201d Cooper pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYes, and their only job was to rescue the princess and save the girls. They weren\u2019t investigating the whys and wherefores because everyone assumed Alea had been caught up in a simple slavery ring. So the question becomes, who hates the princess enough to subject her to hell? And more than that, who needed the money her ransom would have brought?\u201d</p><p>Dane held up a hand. \u201cYou said this had something to do with that girl on TV, the Hahn woman. Are you trying to tell us she had something to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Riley replied. \u201cShe really was a victim, and as far as I can tell, she has some very dark emotions toward Alea. You see, we believe that her story is true. Alea really was there during her torture, but maybe she was forced to use drugs as well. If so, her memory is not necessarily accurate. She would have had nightmares and delusions. It would be easy in that situation to see Alea as a villain. She wasn\u2019t raped the way Brittany was. Even without the drugs, it\u2019s possible that, because Alea\u2019s torture was easier than her own, she would be resentful. I\u2019ve talked to some of the other victims, and most of them see Alea as one of them. A couple of the women asked me to reach out to her. They want to meet and talk because they\u2019re the only ones who really know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if she\u2019s not the one who helped with Alea\u2019s kidnapping, what does she have to do with the person who did?\u201d Cooper was starting to get antsy. His instincts had always been good, and he didn\u2019t like the way his spine was prickling now. Something was very wrong.</p><p>It was the same feeling he\u2019d had when he and Dane had been in the Korengal Valley just before everything went to hell. It was a combination of adrenaline and pure doom.</p><p>\u201cSomeone sent her money to buy a new wardrobe before her TV appearances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone put her up to this? Someone wants to ruin Alea\u2019s image?\u201d Lan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, the same someone who wanted to use her to make money. It would have been easy to hire someone to simply kidnap the princess. She was vulnerable in the States. She didn\u2019t have the same type of security. The flip side was not a lot of people knew her connections to the royal family. There were some people in the embassy, but almost no regular New Yorkers knew who she was.\u201d</p><p>Dominic Anthony seemed to deeply love the sound of his own voice. He was dragging this thing out like Sherlock Holmes reporting to the damn queen. \u201cWho? Just give us a damn name please.\u201d</p><p>Law seemed to be the only one who wasn\u2019t into theatrics. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the Thurston-Hughes people, most likely the chick, Yasmin. She was working for Reaching Across Cultures, the charity fund Alea had originally set up and planned to head once she got her master\u2019s degree. The money that went to Brittany Hahn came from an account directly accessed by the charity fund director. I also confirmed that the Thurston-Hughes family has several offshore accounts, several in the Caymans.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Talib had turned a dull red. Cooper briefly wondered if they still chopped off heads in Bezakistan. \u201cYasmin offered to head the charity in Alea\u2019s stead. She was also the first one to call and to beg me to pay whatever ransom they asked for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a jealous child,\u201d Rafe said, running a hand through his hair. \u201cShe had everything given to her, but she couldn\u2019t stand the fact that Alea lived in the palace. That Alea was called princess. Her mother and father were incredibly wealthy. Our parents were close to them. After Alea\u2019s mother and father died, Yasmin\u2019s parents offered to take her in, but my mother wouldn\u2019t have it. She told me she was afraid Yasmin would make Alea\u2019s life difficult. I would have thought she\u2019d have grown up and gotten over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe she has. She only married Oliver because she thought Alea wanted him. I overheard her talking to some friends at her engagement party,\u201d Kade said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you never bothered to mention this?\u201d Talib asked.</p> <p>\u201cI thought she was just a jealous bitch. I didn\u2019t realize she was crazy enough to have Alea kidnapped,\u201d Kade shot back. \u201cDo we know where Yasmin is in the palace?\u201d</p><p>Cooper felt his blood run cold. \u201cShe\u2019s in the palace? Why the fuck is she here?\u201d</p><p>Dominic answered that one. \u201cI thought it was best to bring her here. I wanted to be able to keep an eye on her. I suspected either she or her husband was involved about a week ago. I had Talib invite them here to discuss the further search for Alea. We told her that she could be critical to the effort. I knew she couldn\u2019t resist being the center of attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this time she just intended to kill Alea?\u201d Lan asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. That plane was insured heavily, plus she managed to bilk her brother-in-law into opening up his accounts so she could upgrade security. I had someone tailing her and listening in on her cell phone conversations for a couple of days. She pocketed the cash. I\u2019m a little worried though because she recently took out a twenty million dollar life insurance policy on her husband. I think once she decided Alea was dead, she no longer needed Oliver Thurston\u2013Hughes. Since she signed a prenup, eliminating him would be her only way of taking as much of his family\u2019s wealth as she could. I intend to have a discussion with Oliver as soon as this meeting is over.\u201d</p> <p>Tal reached for the phone on the conference table in front of him. He pressed a single button. \u201cI need you to put Yasmin Thurston-Hughes under lockdown. Yes, that\u2019s right. She does not have freedom to roam the palace. Cut her phone lines and her Internet access. Do not allow her to leave under any circumstances. And find her husband. Bring him to me in the conference room.\u201d</p><p>Dane stood, placing both hands on the table. \u201cDo you want to explain why you chose to cover this up until now?\u201d</p><p>Dominic went positively arctic. \u201cI didn\u2019t cover up anything, Mitchell. We just got confirmation today. At any point in time, she could have bolted and she has the resources to disappear. I wanted her brought here so she couldn\u2019t escape. Besides, it was rather safe since Alea wasn\u2019t in the palace. Now she\u2019s under guard, and I suspect you three won\u2019t let her out of your sight. She\u2019s locked up in her room. She\u2019s not allowed visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said she couldn\u2019t have visitors,\u201d Tal said, picking up that phone again.</p><p>Cooper didn\u2019t wait for the order. He shoved his chair back and took off running. He prayed Alea was safe and sound and locked away, but his instincts were screaming otherwise.</p><p>Even as he shoved through the doors and into the vestibule, he felt Dane and Lan beside him.</p> <p>Whatever happened, he wouldn\u2019t be alone.</p><p>Alea looked down at the floor and wondered how long Oliver had. He was bleeding badly, curled on his side. She couldn\u2019t see exactly where he was hit, but it had been somewhere in the torso, perhaps his stomach or right at the bottom of his rib cage.</p><p>Oliver probably didn\u2019t have long, but then she wasn\u2019t sure she had much time, either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home for just a few hours but you\u2019re already all over my husband.\u201d Yasmin stared down at the man she\u2019d promised to love and cherish, a disgusted look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI have never touched Oliver. Not ever.\u201d Alea tried to keep her voice calm. Where was the guard? How had Yasmin gotten in? She looked over to the door.</p><p>Yasmin\u2019s lips curled into a wicked smile. She was dressed to kill in all black, from her tight slacks to the shirt that clung to her. It had a plunging V-neckline that showed off her nearly skeletal chest. Yasmin had always been obsessed with being thin, but she was gaunt now. She sported a pair of leather gloves on her hands. She\u2019d obviously been concerned about leaving fingerprints. \u201cThe guard isn\u2019t going to help you, cousin. He was a little too trusting of females. He let me get really close, so I shot him. Do you like the silencer? It really helps. And of course you never touched Oliver. He never wanted you, you stupid cow. Who would want you when they had me? God, Lea, you were even in a brothel and no one wanted you.\u201d</p><p>Panic got shoved down in the place of anger. \u201cYou were behind all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Look, all of our lives, you\u2019ve always gotten everything. Poor little Alea. Her mommy and daddy died so she gets to be the princess. You were ugly and fat and everyone felt sorry for you. But it should have been me. I\u2019m princess material. I should have been the one who lived in the palace.\u201d</p> <p>Alea seriously wanted to slap the bitch. Yas was seriously screwed in the head if she thought that losing her parents and being an orphan had all been made better because she had Her Royal Highness in front of her freaking name. But she couldn\u2019t do what she wanted because that gun would take out more than just Alea. It would take out her baby. Her baby with Cooper, Dane, and Landon. She had to stay calm and give herself time until she could find a way out or her men came for her. Someone would come for her. As soon as that meeting was over, they would be beating down her door.</p><p>Unless they were still furious at her for what she\u2019d done and wouldn\u2019t talk to her tonight. They might go back to their rooms and let her stew. She wouldn\u2019t blame them. She\u2019d basically told Dane that she didn\u2019t love them. She\u2019d put him in a horrible position.</p><p>Oh, god, she couldn\u2019t die like this. She couldn\u2019t die when they thought she didn\u2019t love them.</p><p>Everything she\u2019d suffered before seemed to fade away. She\u2019d spent so much time holding her pain close to her that she hadn\u2019t embraced the love they gave her. Tears blurred her eyes.</p><p>She had to keep Yasmin talking. The balcony doors were open to her left. Her bedroom was to her right. If she got the chance, she could bolt one way or the other. Yasmin loved to talk about herself. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just have them kill me? Why have them take me to a brothel?\u201d</p><p>She glanced back at the door, but then turned back, the gun held casually in her manicured hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t care where they took you, but I laughed my ass off when I found out it was a brothel. I had a blast thinking about you taking it up the ass from anyone with a couple of pesos.\u201d She frowned. \u201cThey were supposed to ransom you. I was going to get a twenty percent cut as a finder\u2019s fee and for working Talib on this end. The assholes decided to squeeze me. If you hadn\u2019t been found when you were, I was going to be in serious trouble. They were going to turn me over to Talib.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think Tal is going to be mad that you killed me now?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged a little. \u201cI\u2019ve set everything up so it looks like you killed yourself and poor dumb Oliver. You couldn\u2019t handle the truth. Everyone knows you helped your kidnappers torture those girls. No one will be surprised you couldn\u2019t handle the guilt. And Oliver was having an affair with you. I\u2019ll tearfully testify to that. His brother already thinks very little of him. When he hears about this, he\u2019ll think even less. He\u2019ll open the checkbook to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this about money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about everything, Alea. I\u2019m not about to just accept my place in the world. I fight for more, unlike you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was racing, pounding in her chest like a barreling freight train. She was so mad, but that anger had to come second to survival. Which safe haven was closer? The balcony. But the doors to the balcony were made of glass. She would have to climb down the trellis. The bedroom was the safer bet, but it was much farther away and lacked cover. If Yasmin was any kind of shot, she would hit Alea in a second. What should she do? She had to make the right decision. Her baby was counting on her. And she wasn\u2019t the only one with a baby.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your baby, Yasmin? How could you kill the father of your baby?\u201d Keep her talking. She could still see the faint movement of Oliver\u2019s chest. He was still alive. She had to hope that he stayed that way.</p><p>A nasty laugh came out of Yasmin\u2019s mouth. \u201cAre you kidding? I\u2019m not pregnant. I\u2019m not some dumb animal who\u2019s going to allow a parasite to suck me dry and make me fat. I pretend to be pregnant every so often and then I tragically lose the baby. To soothe me, he\u2019ll buy me whatever I want for a while. I\u2019m not wrecking my body for some disgusting infant.\u201d</p><p>So pleading to her maternal side wasn\u2019t going to work. Alea drew a deep breath. Her cousin was lost, truly without any redemption. She wasn\u2019t sure how it had happened, but there was something missing in Yasmin that had allowed her to become a true sociopath. Nothing Alea could do would save her. The childhood they had shared had been a lie. The face Yasmin showed the world had been a mask.</p><p>Yasmin sighed as though the whole exercise bored her to tears. She reached into the pocket of her pants and pulled out a second pair of gloves. \u201cI need you to put these on.\u201d</p><p>Yasmin tossed them her way, but Alea allowed them to hit the sofa that came between her and Yasmin. The black gloves hit the cushions and fell to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d It was obvious, but Alea would do just about anything to put off that time when she had to make the decision. Her men just needed a little more time. They would be here. She just knew it. She let her eyes roam the room for anything she could use as a weapon.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll shoot you here and now.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Oliver move slightly, his head coming up. He was trying to change positions, turning very slowly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to work,\u201d Alea said quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt is. Men in this country can\u2019t believe a woman would do anything terrible. I used to get away with a lot when we were kids. I\u2019m just moving on to murder. And after this, I\u2019ll be set. The truth of the matter is, I got lucky when those mercenaries found you because they killed anyone who could have identified me as the person who set you up. I really owe them a lot. And now I\u2019ll get an even bigger slice of the pie because I\u2019ll get Oliver\u2019s insurance money, since you\u2019re going to go crazy and kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to cooperate.\u201d</p><p>Oliver got to one elbow. She could see blood on his hands as he pushed himself up. He was behind Yasmin, his stare finding her back and his fists clenched, red dripping from his palms. How much had he heard? Did he know she wasn\u2019t carrying their child? Did he know she\u2019d never loved him, wasn\u2019t capable of love?</p><p>Yasmin frowned. \u201cYes, you are because I\u2019ll shoot you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Another thing Yasmin rarely did was to really think something through. All throughout their childhood, Yas had come up with outrageous plans only to run up against a wall of logic anyone with half a brain could have seen a mile away. She needed Alea to cooperate, but there was no real incentive to, beyond making Yasmin\u2019s job of getting away with double homicide easier, and Alea just wasn\u2019t in a giving mood.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll shoot me anyway, so I don\u2019t see why I should help you out.\u201d Besides, if she moved, she left the relative safety of the sofa. It was an antique with a high back that reached the middle of Alea\u2019s chest. It had been a piece from her mother\u2019s childhood, handed down from generation to generation from the seventeenth century. It would survive a bullet better than she would.</p><p>Yasmin huffed a breath from her mouth in a frustrated sigh, but a grim light hit her eyes, and she leveled that gun again. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll put them on you afterwards.\u201d</p><p>Oliver was still fighting, now almost to his knees. \u201cAm I supposed to have shot myself in the head from ten feet away? You know the rest of the world watches TV. Everyone knows that the police can figure out the distance a gun was fired from. You need to be closer. You need to make this look like I shot myself in the head and my arms aren\u2019t that long, Yas. You always sucked at math.\u201d</p><p>If there was one thing Yasmin loved more than her clothes and shoes and money, it was complaining about how terrible things had been for her.</p><p>Yasmin\u2019s face went a dull red. \u201cWell, how could I compete with the egghead? I just went to school. I didn\u2019t have an army of tutors to do my work for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yasmin had gone to the world\u2019s most expensive private schools, but that had never been enough for her. There was something deeply empty inside her cousin, something no amount of money or fame or possessions could ever fill. Even if Yasmin succeeded, she wouldn\u2019t be happy. She would find all the flaws in life and hold them tight to her because she believed the world to be against her. She saw herself as a victim. It was how she excused everything she did. It was how she managed to live with herself. What a miserable existence. But it was all Yasmin understood.</p><p>Alea realized that she could have become just like Yasmin if she\u2019d kept trekking down the path to empty bitterness. She would have shut out anyone who could have loved her, and resentment would have ruled her life. Her men had saved her from that. The island had saved her, and now she wanted life and love in the real world, too. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but nothing worthwhile was. That simple truth was what Yasmin had never understood.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work, Yasmin. No one is going to save you from your short sightedness this time. Put the gun down, and I\u2019ll talk to Talib about sending you to a place where you can get some help.\u201d A psychiatric hospital would be a good place for Yasmin. They could figure out if she was a complete sociopath.</p><p>For the first time, Yas looked a little uncertain. \u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m not going down for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI disagree, bitch,\u201d Oliver\u2019s words were guttural as though forced through sheer willpower from his chest.</p><p>Yasmin screamed and turned, her gun firing wildly, hitting the balcony doors and sending glass flying out. The sound filled the room and her ears, making her heart pound again. Now she had to decide which way to run toward safety.</p><p>Oliver shoved at Yasmin, toppling her and sending her to the floor. His dress shirt had turned a horrible muddy red and she could see the gray cast to his skin. His hands shook as he reached for his wife\u2019s throat. Yasmin scrambled, the gun still in her hand. She kicked out and got to her knees.</p><p>The bedroom was too far away, and Yas had a direct line of sight. If she could get a shot off, it would likely hit Alea in the back.</p><p>Another little ping zipped through the air as Yasmin fired wildly.</p> <p>Alea dashed to the doorway, sprinting as she looked back, trying to see what was happening with Oliver and Yasmin. Yasmin kicked out, catching Oliver\u2019s chin and sending him flying. Alea heard his body fall, then another little ping.</p><p>She made it to the balcony before Yasmin turned. Alea forced herself to not breathe as she moved around the glass at her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go, bitch? Do you think I won\u2019t find you? I don\u2019t care about anything now. I just want to kill you! You wrecked everything! Everything!\u201d</p><p>Alea clung to the marbled walls, inching away from the door. She had to get to the trellis and hope that she could still make it to one of the trees that were planted close. When she\u2019d been a child, she\u2019d been able to make it to the ground by jumping from the railing to the tree and shimmying down. Her aunt and uncles had been horrified. Talib had called her a little monkey. Who knew the skill might come in handy now. God, would the branches even hold her?</p><p>She heard a door slamming open. No doubt Yasmin was searching for her in the bedroom.</p><p>This was her one chance. She stepped across the glass, crunching it under her shoes and stepped up on the terrace railing. Shit. It was a long way down.</p> <p>\u201cLea! Lea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLan?\u201d</p><p>Landon stood on the ground beneath her, a gun in his hand. He quickly shoved it into his holster and held his arms up. \u201cJump, Lea. Jump and I\u2019ll catch you. I swear I will. Jump, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot you,\u201d Yasmin snarled as she came through the doors.</p><p>Alea jumped. No question about it. She would rather die trying to get to Lan than face down a bullet. She heard herself scream as she made the short trip from the second story.</p><p>Her breath huffed from her chest as she landed in strong, warm arms.</p><p>\u201cI can kill you both.\u201d Yasmin stood on the balcony, her gun in her hand.</p><p>Lan moved fast, turning so his back was to the gun, and he pressed Alea to the ground.</p> <p>A loud report filled the air. That hadn\u2019t been Yasmin\u2019s gun with its silencer. Then whose?</p><p>\u201cThank god,\u201d Lan whispered and pulled Alea upright.</p><p>Yasmin\u2019s gun fell to the ground, her body slumping over the balcony railing. She hung there for a moment, eyes wide, as Dane and Cooper charged through, both with a semiautomatic in their hands.</p><p>Alea gasped in horror as Yasmin teetered, her body unbalanced, then tipped over the railing. She fell through the air, her blonde hair flipping with her body before she hit the ground with a sickening thud. A glance told Alea that Yas\u2019s neck hung at an unnatural angle. She was dead.</p><p>Dane looked over the railing. \u201cIs Alea okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d Lan yelled. He scooped her up, holding her to his chest.</p><p>Alea stared at Yasmin\u2019s dead body as he carried her away, brutally aware of just how close she\u2019d come to a very similar end. She clung to Lan and cried.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cHow is Oliver?\u201d Piper asked as she poured out the tea and waited for the servant to step back. \u201cThank you so much. That will be all for now. We should be finished in an hour or so. Until then, I\u2019d like to be alone with my cousin, please.\u201d</p><p>The servant frowned, but nodded and bowed as he left the room.</p><p>They were finally alone. It seemed like Alea was never alone these days. \u201cHe\u2019s recovering but very slowly. His brothers arrived a couple of days ago. When the doctors say he\u2019s stable, they want to move him back to England.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d met Callum and Rory at the airport and escorted them to their brother\u2019s side. She\u2019d felt a horrible pressing guilt the whole time. Oliver had been a target because of her. She\u2019d apologized, but the brothers had hugged her and assured her they placed no blame on anyone but Yasmin. Callum had mentioned that if Oliver had followed his initial instincts and pursued Alea instead, none of it would have happened.</p><p>Yasmin had already been cremated, her urn placed in the family crypt by her grieving mother. Alea had felt so badly for her aunt. Though Yasmin had been horrible, her aunt had loved her only daughter. Her grief was complicated. She\u2019d been horrified by what Yasmin had done.</p><p>So much sadness. And there had been so much rage in Oliver\u2019s eyes. Even through the pain of his surgeries, she could see the hatred there that burned for the woman he\u2019d once called his wife.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear he\u2019s going to make it,\u201d Piper said, putting her tea down and looking at the door as it closed. Landon was standing outside the door, his silent figure a monument to his protectiveness.</p><p>Unfortunately, she wanted his figure to be a monument to sexiness and love, but that hadn\u2019t happened. Despite the fact that she\u2019d tried to talk to them about why she\u2019d refused the marriage in the beginning, they didn\u2019t seem to be listening. Oh, the wedding plans were going through. They were scheduled to be married in the garden next week, but Dane and Landon seemed to be going through the motions with grim determination.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Piper asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine. No morning sickness at all. I feel great physically.\u201d</p><p>In fact, the doctor had said she was healthy and that sex wouldn\u2019t be a problem at all, even sex with all her fianc\u00e9s as long as they were careful.</p><p>But Cooper and Landon were the only ones who had slept beside her in the four days that had passed since she\u2019d leapt from the balcony and into Landon\u2019s arms. She\u2019d tried to explain, and Dane said he understood, but he\u2019d been remote.</p><p>They were circling each other like wary sharks, and she needed to break the stalemate. She wanted her wedding to be a joyous occasion, not something they all went through for the sake of the baby.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about your health physically. How are you emotionally?\u201d Piper asked. \u201cI saw that two of the other women from the brothel called you. How did that go?\u201d</p><p>Jennifer and Lisa. She barely remembered them, but they had given her so much strength. She\u2019d been terrified at first, but they had drawn her out, getting her to really talk about what had happened. They had cried, all three of them. They had cried for each other, for themselves, and for the girls who hadn\u2019t made it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting a new foundation. I\u2019m bringing Lisa and Jen into it with me. It\u2019s going to fight international slavery and push the United Nations and other countries to advance women\u2019s rights.\u201d</p><p>Tears formed in Piper\u2019s eyes, and she put down her teacup and reached for Alea\u2019s hand. \u201cA long time ago, Dane told me that how we handle the pain we\u2019ve been given is the way we\u2019re measured in life. A strong person can take the horror and pain and use it to make the world a better place. Lea, I think that\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>She was excited about it, and especially excited about the fact that Jen and Lisa were going to get some of the others together for a visit at the palace so they could meet and talk and help each other heal.</p><p>Alea was going to reach out to Brittany, too. She was letting go of her anger because it had no place in her life. It solved nothing, but forgiveness and understanding...those could solve everything.</p><p>She was done with anger and bitterness. She was ready to move on, but she had no intention of moving on without Dane Mitchell.</p><p>There was the sound of a door opening, and Landon walked in. His blue eyes found hers, and she was shocked at how her heart pounded in her chest at the very sight of him. He nodded toward Piper. \u201cYour Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Piper, Lan. In a couple of days we\u2019ll be family, and no one in my family calls me Your Highness. Well, except for my sister, but it sounds more like Your High Ass. She\u2019s a classy one, my little sis.\u201d</p><p>Lan\u2019s smile made him beam. \u201cI\u2019m excited to meet her. I\u2019m also excited that Coop\u2019s family is going to descend on the palace tomorrow morning. I think it might be the first time that monstrosity Tal calls a plane gets completely filled.\u201d</p><p>Alea couldn\u2019t wait to meet Cooper\u2019s family. She just hoped she could remember all their names. There were six brothers and five of them were married with eleven kids between them. But first, she had a job to do. \u201cAre you going to help me?\u201d</p><p>Lan put a hand on her hair, smoothing it back. \u201cAlways, Lea. You\u2019re sure the doc said it was all right?\u201d</p><p>He was killing her, treating her like she was made of glass. \u201cLan, have you ever heard of pregnancy hormones?\u201d</p><p>Piper shook her head. \u201cOh, honey. I have a load of those.\u201d She also proved she had Alea\u2019s back. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay because your men are taking care of you, right?\u201d</p><p>She was so glad Piper was on her side. She shook her head. \u201cNo. They\u2019re not taking care of me. They\u2019re very gently making love to me, but only once since we got back and only Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Lan went a stark red. \u201cLea, baby, should we be talking about this?\u201d</p><p>Piper stood up and wagged a finger at him. \u201cHow could you? Pregnant women need sex. Crazy, dirty, nasty sex. So, you liked having sex with her so much that she got pregnant, but now that she\u2019s expecting, you\u2019ve lost interest. Is that the way it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. God... N-no, not at all. I\u2019m so horny....\u201d He shut his mouth and started to laugh. \u201cThis is one of those times when you two are having fun with me, isn\u2019t it? Well, fine. I can deal. If you\u2019re going to make it a royal decree that I get down and nasty with the love of my life and share her with my best friends, then I have no choice. I have to follow a royal order. Do you have the key to the dungeon, Piper? Cooper is going to get Dane down there in twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>Piper smiled and handed over a key. \u201cYou guys have fun. The bed is in the back if you decide to stay down there. There\u2019s also a phone that goes directly to the kitchen. We had that installed a few months back because Kade gets hungry when he\u2019s playing. Y\u2019all have fun. I\u2019ll keep Tal busy elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Lan took her hand and started to lead her down the hall. She threaded her fingers through his, but worry still swamped her. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this with me?\u201d</p><p>Lan looked down at her. \u201cDo I want to play bondage games with the most beautiful woman in the world? Uh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seemed to want me lately.\u201d He\u2019d been perfectly polite and he\u2019d said all the right things, but he hadn\u2019t made love to her. \u201cI said some terrible things when we first arrived at the palace. I was reeling and I didn\u2019t mean them. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Lea, I love you. The last few days have been rough. You almost died, baby. You\u2019re pregnant. I\u2019m so worried that I\u2019ll do the wrong thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fragile, Lan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure felt that way when you jumped off the balcony and into my arms. If I had been off, if I\u2019d tripped or stumbled, I would have lost both you and the baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She hugged him close. \u201cOh, you never would have done that. You wouldn\u2019t have dropped me. Why do you think I just jumped? I realize now that no matter what way I would have gone, someone would have saved me. Cooper came in through the back rooms of the suite so he would have found me in the bedroom. Dane came in through the front. And you were going to climb right up to the balcony. I was protected on all sides. She didn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a chance to take a shot at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Lan. I want this afternoon to be perfect. I\u2019m alive. Our baby is alive. The doctor said I can have sex just about any way we want. We only have a few more days to have crazy single sex before we move on to crazy married sex.\u201d She sighed and rested her head on his chest, listening to the sound of his heart. \u201cPlease, Lan. I need to know if I\u2019ve lost Dane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t lost any of us, baby. Dane just feels the weight of what happened. And I\u2019m a little worried that he thinks he needs to change. That\u2019s why Coop came up with this insane plan.\u201d He leaned over and kissed her, his lips brushing against hers. \u201cYou have to prove to Dane you can handle the whole Dom thing. I know he thinks he can live without it, but there will be a huge hole in his life.\u201d</p><p>And in hers as well because she craved the kind of dominance only Dane could give her. \u201cI want him to be happy, Lan. And I want this part of him. I trust you and Dane and Cooper. I love you all so much. I want to try everything. I don\u2019t want any walls between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s get this ball rolling then. You\u2019re wrong about the single sex though, baby. I haven\u2019t been single since the minute I saw you. I think I married you in my heart a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>God, he always said the right things. He thought he was inept, but he always knew how to calm her. She smiled at him, and they started down the hall, to the dungeon, where their lives together were going to begin again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s down here,\u201d Cooper said, practically pulling Dane along.</p><p>What was up with that? Dane pulled back.</p><p>\u201cCoop, the only thing that way is the dungeon.\u201d And he didn\u2019t want to be there. God, he hated the fact that there was a dungeon right here and he would never step into it with Alea. He would never lovingly bind her and torture her for their mutual pleasure. He would never hear her call him Master.</p><p>Husband. He had to be satisfied with being her husband. She couldn\u2019t handle the missionary position, so he definitely couldn\u2019t expect her to climb onto a St. Andrews Cross and count it out for him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, what I need you to see is in the dungeon,\u201d Cooper insisted. \u201cCome on, man. It\u2019s a surprise for Alea. It\u2019s for our wedding night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the dungeon?\u201d</p><p>Cooper shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the one place I don\u2019t expect her to look. Come on, Dane. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re still having doubts.\u201d</p><p>About loving Alea? Not a chance. About being the right man for her? Yeah. He was having all kind of doubts about that. He could still remember the minute he\u2019d seen the guard dead in front of her room, his body lying there like a message to Dane. You\u2019ll lose her. You can\u2019t keep her, you fucking pervert. You ruin everything you touch.</p><p>He could still hear his ex-wife and his father. He\u2019d lost one family over his needs. Was he ready to lose another one? Did he even deserve another one?</p><p>\u201cI love Alea, but the last couple of days have been rough. I had to kill her cousin. I think I should give her some space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer cousin was a jealous whack job who was trying to kill her. I think she\u2019s going to be fine with you pulling that particular trigger. The al Mussads are wonderful, but I have to say that the extended family leaves something to be desired. First Khalil and then Yasmin. I think we should take a look at the old family tree and prune it proactively of any other cousins who don\u2019t live in the palace. Really, it\u2019ll save us so much time and crap in the future,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Dane turned to him. They were getting closer to the dungeon, and he really didn\u2019t get Coop\u2019s good mood. Well, he did. Coop had been making love to Alea. Coop had been wrapping himself in her sweetness. Lan was too worried. And Dane just kept his distance. She hadn\u2019t wanted him since their time on the island, and he couldn\u2019t shove his needs on her. Alea was pregnant, and he\u2019d forced her to marry the three of them. Oh, she\u2019d said all the right things lately, but she\u2019d only said them after she\u2019d learned about the baby.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t something to joke about,\u201d Dane growled.</p><p>Cooper sighed. \u201cBuddy, you have to get out of this mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe almost died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t. She\u2019s alive and needs to know that we still love her. She needs to know that her men will always be here for her.\u201d</p> <p>Probably. But did she love them? If he could shove his darker desires down, maybe after a while she would.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere, Coop.\u201d He would be right there standing beside them when they married Alea, and then he would prove he could handle being vanilla. He would prove he could find a place in this family. And not entering the dungeon would only prove now that he was a pussy. Tal was a Dom. If Dane was going to live in this palace, he had to get used to being around all the things he couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cI know, but you\u2019re not really here either. You\u2019re just existing, and it shouldn\u2019t be that way. We\u2019re getting married. We\u2019re having a baby. This is the time of our lives, and you\u2019re stuck in the past. It\u2019s time to get you unstuck.\u201d Cooper put a hand on the door.</p><p>\u201cMan, you need a key to that.\u201d Tal didn\u2019t just leave the dungeon door open.</p><p>\u201cNot today, I don\u2019t.\u201d Cooper turned the knob and pushed open the heavy door.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d Dane stood there for a moment because the dungeon wasn\u2019t empty. Not at all. Two occupants waited for them, one gloriously naked.</p><p>Alea. His beautiful Alea was bare and standing next to Landon, as they looked over a tray of jewelry. Not jewelry. Toys. Clamps and beautiful chains. All lovely things to decorate a submissive with. He felt his cock go stiff and long, pressing against his slacks as though trying to punch its way out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d Dane croaked hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re on,\u201d Cooper said. He was obviously in on whatever this was. He shrugged out of his shoulder holster and put it within reach, and started to pull off his shirt. \u201cJust like we practiced, Lea. Dane, lock that door. Piper knows we\u2019re in here, but I wouldn\u2019t want the staff to walk in.\u201d</p><p>Running on autopilot, Dane shut the door, his whole body on the edge. He locked it because they apparently had something to say, and Coop was right. They didn\u2019t want anyone walking in.</p><p>He stared at the dark wood of the door, unwilling to turn around and see her again. \u201cAlea, what is this about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about you, Dane.\u201d Her voice sounded slightly unsteady. \u201cI love you. I want to play with you now and for the rest of our lives. I want to give you what you need. Cooper and Landon want to play, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need this, Lea.\u201d He forced himself to swallow down a long breath. \u201cWe\u2019re fine the way we are.\u201d He would never force her to do something she didn\u2019t want. \u201cI won\u2019t treat you like your captors.\u201d</p><p>The last few days had been about far more than just the fact that Yasmin had tried to kill his woman. He\u2019d read every article that had been written about the crash and all the crap those reporters had dug up. Tal had done a good job of keeping it quiet the first time, but the press had gone insane when Alea\u2019s plane crashed. Every sordid truth had been detailed. From her kidnapping to the nastiness of the brothel, to ways she\u2019d been tortured and the fact that she\u2019d been force-fed heroin.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take her control again.</p><p>A soft hand cupped his shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever, ever compare yourself to them. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>He turned and was surprised at the anger in her dark eyes. Tears shimmered there, too, but her mouth was a flat angry line. \u201cLea...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ever, Dane. They were evil, and you\u2019re so good. You\u2019ve spent your life protecting people. You gave up your career to save lives. You are a hero, and I will not allow anyone to make you think less of yourself. I am so sorry I forced you into a terrible position in front of Talib. I really do want to marry you. I want you. Can you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>Something deep inside him softened. She was standing here, naked in front of him, her fierce soul finally on display. Yet she was trying to protect his nasty ass. Though he outweighed her by a hundred pounds, she looked ready to take on anything that might be a threat. For him. Cooper had been right. This wasn\u2019t a woman who gave a shit about how much money he had or his social status. She\u2019d been trying to spare him, but he didn\u2019t want to be spared. He only wanted her and he wanted her happy and safe and whole. After years of living the lifestyle, he finally understood. It wasn\u2019t just about putting her needs before his. It was about putting her first always. She was the center of their universe. Alea and their babies were everything to him. They were his future.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you. Alea, baby, I love you. I don\u2019t need this. I know I\u2019ve been a little aloof, but you just answered every question I had. We\u2019re okay. Let\u2019s get you dressed and go back to our room, and I\u2019ll make love to you properly.\u201d</p><p>With all the gentleness she deserved. He would let her make the pace and only take what she was willing to give. He could handle it.</p><p>\u201cProperly?\u201d She frowned his way. \u201cThat sounds boring, Dane. I want you, especially that dirty, nasty side you\u2019ve been trying to pretend doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>Dane sighed. She seemed determined to not make this easy on him. He felt his whole body tighten. \u201cLea, you don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re asking for.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back, and he missed the heat of her body. \u201cYes, I do. I was on that island. I know what you want. I can handle it, Dane. I can more than handle it. I want it. I crave it.\u201d</p><p>She was so fucking gorgeous. Her whole body was a fucking temple, and he worshipped it. From the pitch black of her hair to her round breasts to the sweet curve of her belly and the flare of her hips. He loved her fucking feet. He usually didn\u2019t give a shit about feet, but hers were so sweet. He always had the craziest impulse to rub them and kiss them because they held her up and moved her along beside him.</p><p>\u201cLea, after everything you\u2019ve been through, you don\u2019t need my damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not damage, Dane. It\u2019s part of you, and I damn well do need it. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am if you hadn\u2019t pushed me.\u201d</p><p>Tal had said that Alea needed him most of all, especially his Dom side. Maybe...the sheikh had been right.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I did today?\u201d</p><p>His heart was aching because she was everything he wanted in life. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI set up an international agency to fight for women\u2019s rights across the globe. I made plans to meet with women who were taken at the same time I was so we can talk and make plans so that what happened to us stops happening to other young women. I became more than a victim. I became a force that those who took me and everyone like them will have to deal with.\u201d</p><p>Damn, those tears were starting again. He\u2019d looked at her so long ago and he\u2019d known what she could be. This warrior in front of him was the woman that girl had become. She could change the world if she set her mind to it.</p><p>\u201cLea, baby, sometimes bad shit happens to the right people. It sucks and it\u2019s horrible but those people can fix things for everyone else. You\u2019re that person. You can stand up for everyone else. This is why it happened to you.\u201d He hated that she\u2019d gone through so much pain, but she had an opportunity to make the world better. He\u2019d spent years fighting in wars, but Alea was the one who would truly fight the good fight. And he would be right there, protecting her.</p><p>She stared up at him, her eyes so passionate. \u201cAnd this is why everything that happened in your childhood, with the Navy, and with your wife happened to you. Dane, can\u2019t you see that? These roads we\u2019ve traveled, they were hard and rough and they made us the people we are. They brought us here\u2014together. I couldn\u2019t have become this person without you, Landon, and Cooper. And this damage you\u2019re talking about...you endured and grew because of it. It\u2019s your strength. Damn it, Dane, it\u2019s our strength.\u201d</p><p>She took a step back and sank to her knees in a perfectly graceful move down to slave position, her knees splayed wide and her palms up. The black waterfall of her hair reached to her breasts, the ends almost tickling her nipples. She squared her shoulders. The deeply submissive position left her pussy and her breasts on glorious display. Her nipples were erect, pointing his way, as though trying to tempt him to lick them and suck them into his mouth. And her pussy was a jewel, gold and pink, with just a hint of the arousal he wanted to flow from her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Landon walked up to her left side, and Cooper to her right. They had both shucked their clothes and each one only had eyes for Alea. They were staring down at her, longing plain on their faces. They were ready for some playtime with their fianc\u00e9e, their woman, the center of their goddamn whole world.</p><p>\u201cWe all want this,\u201d Lan said.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t counted on the fact that he wasn\u2019t the only one who needed this.</p><p>\u201cNone of us would be here without you, buddy,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to claim our sub.\u201d</p><p>Their submissive. Such a misnomer. Submissive. Dominant. They were just words to describe a truth. In the end, they were just men in love with a woman. It was just another way to express the fact that he was crazy about her and he\u2019d do anything to show her.</p><p>\u201cDo you need this, Alea?\u201d This had to be about her. At some point, his world had shifted and his own needs had taken a backseat.</p><p>Her eyes came up, and he saw only truth in them. \u201cI crave this, Dane. I need you. I want to explore what we found on that island. I want to make it real.\u201d</p><p>It had always been real. He\u2019d just been afraid to trust in it. Fuck. It was everything he\u2019d ever wanted. More than he deserved, and only a stupid man would turn it down.</p><p>Dane Mitchell wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>\u201cEyes down, Alea. And spread your knees wider. Spine straight. For tonight, the only safe word you need is \u2018no.\u2019 Later we\u2019ll come up with a fun word so we can play all sorts of nasty games, but for now, a simple \u2018no\u2019 will suffice.\u201d Relief flowed through his body. He felt like a prisoner who had just been granted parole. Or a man who had received full forgiveness and learned that he\u2019d never really sinned at all.</p><p>This was his woman. This was his family.</p><p>\u201cLandon, I think we should warm our little sub up. She\u2019s been quite a brat lately. Actually I think she was born a brat, but we can handle that, can\u2019t we?\u201d Dane heard his voice go deep, and it felt so fucking good. He pulled his shoulder holster off. His eyes strayed back, thinking about the door.</p><p>\u201cWe absolutely can handle her. And relax. We\u2019re perfectly safe here,\u201d Cooper said as though he could read Dane\u2019s thoughts. \u201cThe whole palace is in lockdown for the rest of the day. I believe Piper and the al Mussad boys are having a private meeting up in her rooms. Talib doesn\u2019t like to be interrupted. We have nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>Dane would always worry about her. He would always need to keep her safe, but there was a time to let that worry go and to revel in the love they made. He pulled his shirt off. \u201cI need to order new leathers.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to take her to a club. He would take such pride in showing the world the woman he shared with the best men he knew. He imagined how beautiful she would be on a St. Andrews Cross, her trust for her men plain for the world to see.</p><p>\u201cI think we all need to order some leathers because the thought of really topping her is doing something for me,\u201d Lan said. \u201cI think the dungeon might be the only place where I can be in charge with her.\u201d</p><p>Alea frowned prettily. \u201cOh, it hasn\u2019t felt that way, Landon. You\u2019re always bossy with me. \u2018No, Alea. You can\u2019t have a moment to yourself. No, Alea, you\u2019re not going to the marketplace.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Dane stared down at her. \u201cEvery word that comes out of your mouth makes the orgasm trail that much longer.\u201d</p><p>She grinned, obviously misunderstanding.</p><p>Cooper snorted a little. \u201cHoney, he means your orgasm is at the very end of a long trail, not that the trail is littered with orgasms.\u201d</p><p>The sweetest pout hit her lips. \u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>Still, she put her head down again, regaining her submissive pose.</p><p>\u201cI think we all agree that in the real world, we\u2019ll let Alea have her say.\u201d Dane fixed his gaze on the most beautiful sight he\u2019d ever seen. \u201cBut here, we\u2019re the Doms. We\u2019re her princes and she\u2019s our princess.\u201d</p> <p>She kept her head down, but there was no way to miss her slow smile. \u201cYou three are always my princes. And I\u2019m ready to do your bidding.\u201d</p><p>Only one thing was holding him back. \u201cAlea, what about our baby?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to wait nine months to claim his sub, but he would. He would wait forever because there was no other woman for him. He\u2019d gone into his first marriage because it had seemed like it was time to marry. This was something different. This was worth waiting for. He\u2019d made a mistake before because there was only one marriage that counted, and that was the one he fought for, bled for, and lived for. Their Alea. Their family.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to the doctor, and he understands what is involved with a Bezakistani marriage,\u201d Alea explained. \u201cPiper is farther along than I am, and her activities haven\u2019t been curtailed yet. So we\u2019re in the clear for now. Let\u2019s not waste any time. Love me. I want you all to love me. I need my men to come to me as the Dominants you are.\u201d</p><p>His cock twitched, begging him to jump at the offer. She was a smart woman. She knew her mind, and she damn well knew what she wanted. He dishonored her to think she didn\u2019t. She was his and she was ready. \u201cHands and knees, Alea. Did you think you could refuse to marry us and there wouldn\u2019t be some punishment?\u201d</p><p>She moved, but not before he caught her smile. \u201cI should have thought about that, Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster,\u201d he corrected. God, he loved the way that word sounded. He\u2019d never been anyone\u2019s Master. He\u2019d only ever been a Sir. A Master was committed, devoted, forever. \u201cYou\u2019re about to marry me. I\u2019m your Master. I won\u2019t ever have another submissive. You are the end-all, be-all of my existence as a Dom, so give me my due.\u201d</p><p>She shifted on the floor, moving forward and finding her position on her hands and knees, her hair hanging down around her.</p><p>\u201cYes, my Master,\u201d she breathed, emotion choking her voice. \u201cAnd I deserve some discipline for the other day. It was never about not loving you all. I love you so much. I ached the whole time we fought. I should have trusted you to be strong enough to stand with me. I should have trusted us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What have you learned?\u201d He wanted to hear it. He wouldn\u2019t believe it until it came from her lips.</p><p>\u201cI should have turned to you because families face hard times together. Because my problems are your problems. We share everything. The good and the bad. I promise you, I will never push you away again. I will cling to this relationship because it\u2019s my life.\u201d</p><p>A well of peace opened inside Dane\u2019s heart. He\u2019d waited his whole life for those words with these people in this one place where he belonged. He let go of the leash he\u2019d kept himself on forever. \u201cNever again, Lea. You will never place me in that position again because I will do the same thing. I will fight back and I will fight dirty because you belong with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where we all belong,\u201d Cooper said, running his hand across her back, worshipping her skin with his own. \u201cDo you know how beautiful you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous.\u201d Landon touched her hair, skimming it with his fingers. \u201cI love you like this. You\u2019re pretty in those gowns and stuff, but I always think of you naked and kneeling.\u201d</p><p>Dane walked around to her back, enjoying every inch of the view. Her spine was straight, her knees splayed wide so he could just start to see her pussy. It pouted between her legs, glistening with a light coating of her juice. That peach would be even riper and more ready after he was finished. \u201cGentlemen, let\u2019s get started. We all need to know how to spank this ass. Landon, you start us out. For now, it\u2019s a count of twenty.\u201d</p><p>Landon didn\u2019t hesitate. He moved to her backside, getting on his knees and bringing his hand back. He proved he\u2019d been listening on the island. He used the flat of his hand on the fleshiest part of her ass. A loud smack reverberated through the room. He loved that sound and the way Alea gasped, her whole body flushing beautifully. She held herself still. Her hair moved, and he could see the way her shoulders shook as the erotic torture continued. Lan smacked her ass again and again. Dane walked over so he could watch. He loved the way her flesh moved under Lan\u2019s hand, the color turning a pretty pink.</p><p>\u201cHold your hand on her ass. Let the heat sink in.\u201d He needed to teach his partners so they would always know how to discipline their sweet sub. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d</p><p>Lan immediately stepped back, allowing Dane to move into place. They moved almost fluidly, and it sent a wave of calm through Dane. They could do this. The Dom in him was possessive, but it was easy now, because Alea needed Cooper and Lan. And he needed them, too. This life he was embracing would be extraordinary because he got to share it with his friends.</p><p>\u201cMake it a quick smack, then a slow burn.\u201d After five quick smacks to that round ass, he let his hand grip her, feeling the shudder go through her. And he could smell what getting naked and kneeling before her Masters had done to her. The musky spice of Alea\u2019s arousal tightened his cock and made him crazy. He wanted to mount her and shove his cock deep, taking her over and over until he\u2019d imprinted himself on her, but that wouldn\u2019t serve his purpose. Patience was required. Patience would make the pleasure so much more stronger, would bond them all together. \u201cAre you all right, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting my ass smacked, Dane. All right is a weak description.\u201d</p><p>He loved her bratty mouth because it just made it all the easier to discipline her. \u201cThat\u2019s another ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDane,\u201d she pleaded, her head turning back. \u201cDane, I\u2019m already dying here.\u201d</p><p>It was time to really begin her training. She needed to learn patience as well. \u201cYou keep your eyes to the front unless I tell you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack. Smack.</p><p>He held his hand tight to her flesh. She was turning a glorious shade of pink, and he could feel the heat radiating from her flesh.</p><p>Cooper got to his knees on the other side of Alea. \u201cLet me help.\u201d</p><p>And Landon could start getting things ready. It seemed to have been his role in this plot. Dane couldn\u2019t be angry about it. It had been a huge gift his partners and their woman had given him.</p><p>\u201cLandon, find a proper pair of clamps. I think we should dress our little sex toy before putting her to good use.\u201d</p><p>Alea\u2019s little moan let him know she was okay. There were still so many things that could trigger bad memories for her, but they wouldn\u2019t know how far they could go without pushing her boundaries. He nodded at Cooper, and they took turns smacking her ass, finding a rhythm. Alea swayed slightly and the throaty sounds that came from her mouth went straight to his dick.</p><p>When he finally counted thirty, her head had dropped, shoulders relaxed, and she simply swayed with every slap to her ass. She wasn\u2019t fighting or struggling. She was floating on pure sensation. She was right where he wanted her.</p><p>\u201cSuch a good sub,\u201d Dane muttered, allowing his hand to stroke her hip. He leaned over and placed a kiss on the small of her back. He wondered how pregnancy would change her. She would be so beautiful, all round and soft and filled with their child. He would coddle her and spend his days rubbing her feet and her belly. Yeah, he was looking forward to that. \u201cI think a good submissive should get a treat.\u201d</p><p>His fingers trailed down and found the soft flesh of her pussy. It was engorged with blood, a flower in bloom. His fingers slid easily around her labia and around her clit.</p><p>\u201cDane, Dane. It feels so good. I\u2019m so aware. I can feel everything,\u201d she said on a moan.</p><p>That was the whole purpose of the spanking. He\u2019d forced her out of her own head and left her no choice but to be in the moment with them. A woman as smart as Alea could sometimes get lost in her thoughts and worries and be unable to connect with the intimacy of sex. Especially given what she\u2019d been through, Dane wanted her wholly in the moment. In this dungeon, there was no room for anything but them. There was only pleasure and erotic pain and the deep connection between lovers.</p><p>She whimpered a little as he brushed against her core.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a cock up this pussy?\u201d He loved dirty talk, but he\u2019d hesitated until now, worried it would send her back to a bad place.</p><p>Not this time. She thrust her backside toward him, trying to lure his fingers deeper. He immediately pulled back and smacked her ass again.</p><p>\u201cDane, please.\u201d</p><p>He loved hearing her plead. It showed him just how far they would come that she felt safe enough to play this way. It gave him so much peace and made him feel powerful. \u201cNo, Alea. You\u2019re not in control here. I believe I mentioned there would be a point when I took the power back. Well, tonight is the night, my love. You\u2019re going to be sweet and obedient. Only then will you have pleasure like you\u2019ve never known. But not until we\u2019ve had our fun. Now, on your knees. I believe Landon has found some pretty clamps to decorate your nipples.\u201d</p><p>Landon walked up carrying two pretty ruby clamps. He approved of the choice. He could control just how tight they got, making them bite into her nipples but not so tightly she would be in danger of real damage. Lan turned them over and he held them up as Cooper helped Alea get to her knees, her lovely body flushed with frustrated arousal. That was just how he wanted her. He moved to the front and showed her the dangling clamps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey look like earrings, but I know what they\u2019re for,\u201d she said with a soft smile. \u201cDo you want me to hold my breasts up for you, Master?\u201d</p><p>God, she knew what she was doing. He dropped down beside her. \u201cI think I\u2019ll deal with that in a moment. First, I forgot to do something. I want to set up a few rituals and traditions. Rituals are very important in BDSM, but each relationship can have different ones. I want to talk about how you greet your Master, even when we\u2019re in the vanilla world.\u201d</p><p>She ran her tongue along her lower lip. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always kiss me. When I walk in a room, you are to find me and greet me with a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that, Master.\u201d She tilted her head up, offering her lips.</p><p>He took her head in his hands and kissed her. He didn\u2019t waste time with nibbling and playing. He devoured her like the starving man he was. Days had gone by without a single taste of her, and he couldn\u2019t do it again. He needed her. He would kiss her and love her every day. Even on days when they couldn\u2019t make love, he would get a taste of her like this so she was always on his tongue, a reminder of why it was so good to be alive. He forced her mouth open and slid his tongue against hers in a silky dance. Over and over, he thrust in and dragged out in a perfect imitation of what he wanted to do to her.</p><p>When he was breathless and aching, he brought his head up and broke the kiss. He stared down into the brown eyes that kicked him in the gut every time he saw them. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want from you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were warm as she looked up at him. \u201cI want it, too, Dane. I want it from all my men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have it.\u201d He got up and allowed Cooper to take his place.</p><p>Cooper kissed her, pulling her against his body and rubbing himself all over her. The minute he moved, Landon was all over her. None of them wanted to wait. They all wanted their kisses. And they were about to get a whole lot more.</p><p>\u201cLandon, I know how much you love our sub\u2019s breasts. Why don\u2019t you get them ready for her clamps?\u201d Dane asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Landon agreed. He wrapped her in his arms and forced her chest up so his mouth was level with her breasts. He sucked a nipple into his mouth, pulling hard on it.</p><p>Alea\u2019s breath hitched, her whole body wrapping around Landon as he began to suckle her breasts. Landon lavished them with affection, biting and sucking and rubbing his face against her. He made sure her nipples were hard little nubs, ready for the kiss of the clamp.</p><p>Landon pulled back, and Cooper had already moved into position. They were already a well-oiled machine. Cooper got behind her, his big hands cupping the breasts Lan had made ready. He held them up like the ripest of fruit, offering them to Dane.</p><p>Dane held the clamps up, allowing them to dangle so she could see them. \u201cThe rubies will look beautiful against your skin. Well, this pretty red glass will.\u201d</p><p>Alea shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? Tal doesn\u2019t do anything halfway. Those are two carats apiece, and I assure you they\u2019re natural and not lab created. Welcome to your new world, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He was about to clamp his sub with a hundred thousand dollars\u2019 worth of jewels. Before it would have made him nervous, but now he was happy they were real. She deserved real. Alea didn\u2019t need money from him. She had millions in her trust funds. But he did have something she needed, something only he could give her. He had his love, and she\u2019d made him realize that his love was worth something. \u201cI assume the actual clamp is real gold. All the better to bite you with, my dear.\u201d</p><p>He took the left peak in one hand and twisted it with a nasty little nip before sliding the clamp on and tightening it. She would definitely feel that. He gave the right nipple the same attention before he clamped it and sat back to look at his handiwork.</p><p>Her breasts were gorgeous, the nipples a dark red. He\u2019d been right. The rubies shone against the gold of her skin, making her look like a work of art. They would bounce with her breasts when they finally fucked her.</p><p>Dane got to his feet and made quick work of his boots and slacks, tossing them aside and setting his cock free. He was harder than he could imagine. The damn thing was nearly pulsing in his palm.</p><p>\u201cLea, it\u2019s time to serve your Masters.\u201d He stepped in front of her, placing his hand on her hair. \u201cI love you, you know that, right? You can stop this at any time, and we\u2019ll take it slower. We can take all night.\u201d His dick protested, but his dick wasn\u2019t as important as she was.</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Dane. This is nothing like what happened to me. This is warm and loving. I\u2019m not going to let what happened then hold me back now. Yes, I\u2019m ready to serve my Masters because they serve me so well. I want to return the favor.\u201d</p><p>A savage joy raced through him. She was fine. And it was time to push some boundaries. \u201cGentlemen, why don\u2019t you join me? It\u2019s time to see just how sweet our submissive\u2019s mouth is.\u201d</p> <p>Dane held his cock out and everything in him tightened as he gripped her hair and let his Dominant nature flow.</p><p>Alea looked at the cock in front of her and felt her eyes widen because Dane\u2019s big, beautiful cock wasn\u2019t alone for long. Cooper came to his left side and Landon to his right. Both had their cocks in hand, looking down at her with hot eyes.</p><p>Her whole body felt like it was on fire. Dane was a damn fine erotic torturer. She\u2019d hoped that they would just fall on her and start the evening right, but no. That wasn\u2019t Dom Dane\u2019s way. Her Master wanted to make her crazy for him, Lan, and Coop before he was going to give her what she needed so badly.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t matter. All that counted was that all three of her men were here and there were no more problems between them. The shadows of the past had been exposed to the light, and she didn\u2019t need to cling to them anymore. She could be with these men and figure out who she was becoming. She couldn\u2019t go back to the girl she\u2019d been, but she could move forward and be a woman they would all be proud of. A woman who was strong enough to survive. A woman who could love the way she needed to love, without apologies and with a heart full of passion.</p><p>If Dane Mitchell thought this was torture, well, two could play that game.</p><p>She leaned forward and licked at the head of the thick purple cock in front of her. Dane didn\u2019t say a word, but she could see how every muscle of his body tightened, and he was forced to change his stance so he wasn\u2019t off balance. A little pearl of silky fluid pulsed from the slit of his dick. Yeah, he wasn\u2019t as calm as he wanted her to believe. He was right here with her, desperate to connect in the way they only could through play.</p><p>Alea moaned a little as she swept the salty fluid up with her tongue and sucked the head of Dane\u2019s cock into her mouth. She lightly scraped him with her teeth, then rolled her tongue around the head. She\u2019d thought she wouldn\u2019t love this, serving her lover in this way, but she\u2019d been wrong. She loved sucking their cocks and feeling them in her mouth. So much power and so much trust between them.</p><p>She sucked Dane in long passes, forcing her jaw open a little more each time.</p><p>\u201cGod, baby, you give the best head. Do you have any idea what your mouth does to me?\u201d Dane growled the words.</p><p>Alea let her eyes drift up to see Dane was watching his cock disappear between her lips. His face was a hard mask of desire. His hands tightened in her hair, pulling her hard onto his cock.</p><p>\u201cTake more. Let me feel the back of your throat.\u201d</p><p>He was huge, but she worked at getting him all the way in her mouth, until he filled every inch and she couldn\u2019t move her tongue, could only move her mouth over and over his cock.</p><p>She pulled away finally, turning slightly toward Cooper. She had more than one Master. A long sexy huff came from Cooper\u2019s chest as he pulled her toward him.</p><p>\u201cTake my dick, baby,\u201d Cooper said, his voice a harsh grind of words. \u201cI want to feel you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suck their cocks, Lea,\u201d Dane commanded. \u201cYou don\u2019t stop until I tell you to.\u201d</p><p>He moved away, and she got the feeling that he was going to play some more. He liked to challenge her, and he had a pervertedly devious mind.</p><p>She sucked on Cooper\u2019s cock as she heard Dane moving around in the background, opening doors and pulling out drawers. What was he planning?</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter because she was caught in the moment. She loved the way Cooper tasted. Of all three of her almost-husbands, he was the one who loved to talk during sex.</p><p>\u201cI love how hot your mouth is. It\u2019s so fucking tight, Lea. Cup my balls.\u201d The hand in her hair became demanding, pulling and pushing her.</p><p>She reached a hand up and cupped his testicles. Landon hovered close, his hand on her shoulder as he watched her suck his best friend\u2019s cock. She loved the way he didn\u2019t blink, just stared. There was no jealousy between them, just lust and love. She reached up and gripped Landon\u2019s cock, running her hand across the velvety flesh.</p><p>\u201cTighter, harder,\u201d he commanded. \u201cBe rough with me, Lea. I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>She moved between the two of them, sucking each and running her tongue from tip to balls where she drew them into her mouth and reveled in the way her men shook.</p><p>She felt Dane move in behind her. \u201cKeep it up, Lea. You\u2019re handling them beautifully.\u201d</p><p>And then she gasped because Dane spread the cheeks of her ass and chilly lube dribbled between them.</p><p>So much sensation. She felt alive from her scalp to her nipples, to her pussy and ass now clenching in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop sucking, Lea, or we\u2019ll have to start all over again. Right from the beginning.\u201d She could hear the sadistic chuckle in Dane\u2019s words.</p><p>He was going to kill her. She couldn\u2019t go back. She was dying now. She sucked Landon\u2019s cock in her mouth while she stroked Cooper\u2019s.</p><p>Dane\u2019s fingers, warm and insistent, played at the ring of her ass, pressing in and circling. She shivered, but she didn\u2019t stop running her tongue over Lan. She wasn\u2019t going to let Dane win. This was play, but she was going to win.</p><p>She switched to Cooper as Dane breached her ass, his finger rimming her before going deep.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me out,\u201d Dane murmured. \u201cIn a minute, you\u2019re going to wonder why you ever wanted to. Let me show you a little trick. Keep pleasing Cooper and Lan, and I\u2019ll give you a treat.\u201d</p><p>She really wanted a treat. She wanted her men\u2019s cocks but Dane seemed determined to make this last hours.</p><p>A second finger joined the first, but not in her ass. This clever finger found her pussy and drove deep.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t nearly enough, but it felt so good. She pressed back.</p><p>Cooper groaned. \u201cWhatever you\u2019re doing, man, keep it up. Every time she moans, I feel it on my cock. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll last.\u201d</p><p>Dane was moving again, both fingers fucking into her. His free hand was around her waist, holding her still. \u201cDon\u2019t you come. Tonight we come together inside her. But she deserves to come more than once. After all, she has three men. She deserves all the orgasms we can wring out of her.\u201d</p><p>Cooper pulled away. She looked to Lan, but he shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m close too, baby. That mouth of yours feels so damn good. Go on and get on your hands and knees. If Dane is doing what I think he\u2019s doing, it\u2019s going to be easier for you.\u201d</p><p>He helped her ease to the floor, and she felt Dane\u2019s thumb slip over her clit.</p><p>Oh, holy hell. Her whole body felt like it was going to light up. He had fingers in her pussy and her ass and he was rubbing her clit. Lan slipped a hand under her and played with the clamps, making her breasts flare. The sensation went straight to her pussy. She\u2019d thought she was wet before, but now she felt her arousal peak, making her warm and wet. She felt Cooper\u2019s hands on her, stroking down her back.</p><p>\u201cGive it to us, darlin\u2019. I want to watch you come,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you like having something hard and warm in your pussy and your ass?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Dane had found a rhythm, his fingers fucking into her before he finished with a long slow glide over her clit, only to start the whole process over again.</p><p>A loud smack cracked through the air, and Alea yelped.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question, Lea,\u201d Cooper said, his hand touching where he\u2019d just smacked. He seemed to be finding his inner Dom.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to let her get away with anything. Dane\u2019s fingers were moving faster, making her blood pump and taking her breath away, but if she didn\u2019t give Cooper what he wanted, Dane might stop. \u201cYes, I like his fingers in my pussy and my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my sub,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>Lan twisted the right clamp, and Alea gasped. Dane found some magic place, and suddenly she went off like a rocket, the orgasm detonating deep in her body.</p><p>As she came down from the high, Dane pulled his hand free. \u201cThat was beautiful, Lea. I\u2019m going to clean up while Lan and Cooper get you on the bed. I don\u2019t want to wait another second to get inside you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sagged in Lan\u2019s arms. He moved her so he could get an arm under her legs. He picked her up as he stood, his strong body never showing a bit of strain. She loved it when they carried her around. It made her feel delicate and feminine and so beloved.</p><p>Lan looked down at her, a smile tilting up the corner of his lips. His blue eyes were shining. \u201cI love you, Lea.\u201d</p><p>Her Landon. He was so sweet under that badass exterior. He was her protector, the silent one who had always been there, waiting to step in front of whatever came her way. \u201cI love you, too. So much.\u201d</p><p>He took her to the big bed in the back of the room. Cooper was already there, lying on his back, his arms open. His muscular body was spread out for her pleasure. Her Cooper. He was the one who always made her laugh, who kept the peace between them all when her stubborn nature surfaced.</p><p>\u201cCome here, baby. I want you to ride my cock.\u201d</p><p>Lan set her on the bed, helping her to mount Cooper. Her body was already coming to life again.</p><p>\u201cI need to get the clamps off first,\u201d Dane said, joining them on the bed. \u201cI can\u2019t leave them on too long.\u201d</p><p>Her Dane. He was the one who held them together, the immovable object who wouldn\u2019t allow them to drift apart. He\u2019d been willing to fight everyone, even her, to make a place in her life. They were here because of him.</p><p>Her men. Her loves.</p><p>Cooper moved between her legs and she felt the head of his cock probing. He rolled his hips up and filled her with one hard thrust. \u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019ve wanted to be all day. Now hold still and let them do what they need to do.\u201d</p><p>It was hard to do when she could feel Cooper so deep inside her. All she wanted to do was ride that cock, but his hands were tight on her hips, holding her in place.</p><p>\u201cThis is going to hurt, but only for a second.\u201d Dane was to her right, his hand moving for her breast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make the pain go away,\u201d Lan promised.</p><p>They moved almost as one, both men removing the clamps from her nipples, while Cooper held her, his hips moving just a little, keeping them connected.</p><p>The blood rushed back into her nipples and she screamed, but her men were ready. Dane and Lan lowered their heads, each taking a tortured nipple into his mouth and soothing it with their tongues.</p><p>The pain that had flooded her sent a jolt of adrenaline through her system, rousing her from the drugged feeling the last orgasm had left her with. She came back to vibrant life as they suckled her nipples and Cooper filled her pussy.</p><p>Dane came off her nipple and kissed her roughly. His cock was straining and there was a tube of lubricant in his hand. \u201cI love you, Lea. Are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Was she ready to have all three of her men at the same time? Hell yes. She wasn\u2019t afraid of being held down by them. Dane would cover her body with his, but she wouldn\u2019t be caged. She was never more free than when she was with her men. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Dane kissed her again and disappeared from the bed. Lan got up on his knees, offering her his cock. She couldn\u2019t help but admire those perfect abs and his cut chest. He was beautiful from his sandy hair to his strong legs to his thick cock.</p><p>\u201cSuck me, Lea. I want to come in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She felt the bed dip as Dane moved in behind her. Cooper in her pussy, Lan in her mouth, and Dane taking her ass. With a smile, she leaned over and licked at Lan\u2019s cock.</p><p>\u201cTake a deep breath, then let it out, baby. You\u2019re ready for this.\u201d Dane rubbed more lube on her empty, clenching hole before lining up his cock. She could feel him, his hands gripping her waist as his cock probed.</p><p>He was so much bigger than the plug, and Cooper was enormous in her pussy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, baby.\u201d Lan smoothed her hair back. \u201cHe\u2019ll fit. It\u2019s just going to feel like he\u2019s splitting you in two for a minute. Then you\u2019ll stretch, and it\u2019ll feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone this much, Lan?\u201d Alea was panting. The pressure was making her crazy.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me spank you, Lea,\u201d Dane warned.</p><p>Lan winked down at her. \u201cYeah, baby, don\u2019t make us stop and spank you.\u201d</p><p>She had to watch her mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to spank me. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was best that he just shoved something in her mouth so she couldn\u2019t say anything sarcastic. A light joy overtook her. She wasn\u2019t worried about anything now. She was fully here with them. The past could never go away, but now she could see that it had brought her to this glorious future.</p><p>She sucked Landon into her mouth as Dane breached her ass. God, she was full, so full. They took up all the space inside her, clear to her heart, and Dane was ruthless. He wouldn\u2019t stop, gave her no moment to pause, simply fed his never-ending cock into her in one slow thrust. Dane and Cooper held on, forcing her to be still as they invaded, heating her from the inside out. She was full to bursting and they held themselves inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou ready, Cooper?\u201d Dane asked, his voice a low rasp.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s so fucking tight. I won\u2019t last long.\u201d Cooper\u2019s hands were restless on her skin.</p><p>\u201cI know I won\u2019t last long either.\u201d Lan winked down at her as he thrust into her mouth, filling her with his clean, masculine taste.</p><p>Her core was already humming, her skin sizzling with anticipation. She worked Lan\u2019s cock, trying to concentrate. She ran her tongue over him and sucked hard, trying to draw him out. His pleasure was her goal.</p><p>\u201cNone of us is going to last, but the good news is we\u2019ve got about fifty or sixty years to perfect it. I\u2019ll take that. Let\u2019s give this a shot.\u201d Dane started to pull out of her ass, and she couldn\u2019t help the gasp that erupted from her. Every nerve ending in her backside screamed with pleasure.</p><p>Dane pulled out while Cooper thrust up, his pelvis grinding at her clit.</p><p>Pure sensation wracked her. She sucked at Landon, trying to stave off the moment when she exploded. It felt so good, so sweet as she was rocked between them. She never wanted it to end. She was completely surrounded, utterly taken by them.</p><p>They found a pounding rhythm. In and out. Out and in. Someone was always deep inside her, filling her and bringing her closer and closer to the edge.</p><p>All the while she sucked at Landon. He fucked her mouth hard, thrusting until his cock hit the back of her throat. She swallowed hard and felt him pulse as warm come coated her tongue.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. That\u2019s what I need.\u201d Landon moaned, falling back as he popped out of her mouth.</p><p>As though they had been waiting, Dane and Cooper tightened, holding her close as they picked up the pace. She felt a hand slip between her and Cooper. Lan was on his knees beside her, helping his partners out.</p><p>\u201cGive it to us, baby,\u201d Landon said.</p><p>Alea rocked between them, her whole body on the edge, every sense engaged with them. They were her whole world, her sight and smell and feel. Her future.</p><p>Dane thrust in, his cock going deep, lighting her up. She rode the wave, rolling her hips, riding them as hard as they were riding her. She belonged here, with her men around her, worshipping her and allowing her to love them back.</p><p>Lan\u2019s fingers pinched her clit and the orgasm was on her, more powerful than anything she\u2019d felt before. She screamed with the pleasure, her whole body going nuclear. She felt Dane come, his big body shuddering as he spilled hot jets inside her.</p><p>And then Cooper thrust up, his cock surging and spilling, heating her.</p><p>She collapsed onto Cooper, Dane at her back. There wasn\u2019t any room for fear now. She laid her head on Cooper\u2019s chest as Dane rolled off, sliding to her side and wrapping an arm around her. Lan smiled down at her.</p><p>Dane\u2019s hand found her belly, his palm resting over the spot where their baby lay. \u201cGet used to this. No more sleeping alone for you.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes even as her body still pulsed with the love they\u2019d made.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be alone again. Not ever.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Eleven months later</p><p>The palace was filled with cries. They seemed to ring down the hallways at all hours of the night. The babies, born so close together, seemed to know when the other was awake, and they would yell out in chorus as though they were linked.</p><p>Alea heard Matin start to cry and wondered how long it would be before Piper\u2019s son howled in sympathy. Sabir, the future sheikh of Bezakistan, was a few months older than Alea\u2019s baby, but he was already turning over and trying to watch out for his cousin.</p><p>Alea picked up her sweet Mat and cuddled him, hoping to settle him down before the whole palace was up.</p><p>\u201cHey, baby, just bring him into bed.\u201d Lan stood in the doorway yawning.</p><p>She glanced at the rocker. \u201cI can nurse him in here and then the three of you can get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Coop strode up, looking over Lan\u2019s shoulder. His face lit up when he saw Mat. \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep when you\u2019re not around. Come on. Bring Matty to bed. You know he\u2019ll be up for an hour. Besides, it\u2019s close to dawn and we have to prepare for the trip to New York. The plane leaves in four hours. We can sleep on the plane.\u201d</p><p>She heard Dane\u2019s laugh as he joined them. \u201cSleep on the plane? With two babies? You are an eternal optimist, man. Besides, I just turned on the news and you\u2019re never going to believe what I saw.\u201d</p><p>She still wasn\u2019t in love with reporters, but she followed her men into their bedroom to hear the latest. The nursery was a new addition to their wing in the palace. It made nursing her very hungry little guy so much easier. She settled on to the bed and saw that Dane had paused one of the morning shows. She\u2019d barely uncapped her nursing bra before Mat had latched on and was enthusiastically sucking. He was a world champion nurser. She smiled down at his tuft of dark hair. He was the most beautiful thing in the world. \u201cAre they covering the speech at the UN?\u201d</p><p>She was due to talk about human trafficking in front of the United Nations Council as a part of her organization\u2019s push to raise awareness. All during her pregnancy she\u2019d worked hard. She\u2019d grown the charity with her new friends and she\u2019d seen a counselor who helped her break through the chains she\u2019d been in since that terrible day. And she\u2019d basked in the love of her husbands.</p><p>Sometimes bad things happened to the right people. Dane had told her that. Sometimes terrible things happened, but when the right person pushed through and found the other side, she could be a hand to lead others. She could be a voice for those who had none.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t cover your speech until Wednesday, baby. I have a whole lineup of interviews for you. Don\u2019t give me that look. You have to do them.\u201d Dane had taken over a position with the charity, organizing and planning her appearances. He was a whiz at getting her the best spots. \u201cNo, this is about our old friends at Anthony Anders Investigations.\u201d</p><p>He clicked the remote and the broadcast began.</p><p>Dominic Anthony and the Anders brothers, Lawson and Riley. She hadn\u2019t talked to them in a couple of months. They had sent Mat a lovely baby gift, but from what she understood, they were involved in a big case.</p><p>A picture of a beautiful blonde in a designer wedding gown filled the screen.</p><p>\u201cHeiress Kinley Kohl was kidnapped yesterday afternoon from her hotel room in New York City. She was preparing for her five o\u2019clock wedding to the controversial tycoon Greg Jansen. FBI sources have been quietly investigating Jansen for possible criminal activity, but no charges have been filed. At first Miss Kohl was considered a runaway bride, but security camera footage shows the bride in a laundry bin, being hauled out of the hotel by two men dressed as employees.\u201d</p><p>The grainy security footage flashed on. It was of two men rolling a large laundry cart down a hallway. The top of the cart opened and a woman\u2019s head popped out, complete with a veil. She shook a fist and tried to climb out, but one of the men stuffed a rag over her face, and she relaxed in his arms. He was deeply tender as he placed her back in the bin, smoothing the veil down so it didn\u2019t cover her face. The men seemed to argue for a moment, and then the camera caught a face.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, that\u2019s Law,\u201d Cooper said, staring at the TV.</p><p>\u201cIt could be Riley. They look so alike.\u201d Lan looked closer. \u201cNah, you\u2019re right. Only Law can look that mean. Damn. I figured they were serious about finding a woman to share, but I didn\u2019t think they would kidnap one.\u201d</p><p>The report went on, naming the Anders brothers and their boss, Dominic Anthony, as the men responsible for the heiress\u2019s abduction.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s up with them. Damn, but I would like to know what,\u201d Dane said with a wolfish grin. \u201cI\u2019ll have to see if I can get in touch when we get to the States. Well, if they haven\u2019t already been arrested, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can offer them asylum in Bezakistan,\u201d Cooper offered.</p><p>Alea frowned. \u201cThey just kidnapped a woman.\u201d</p><p>But she didn\u2019t buy it. She\u2019d gotten to know those men. They were rough but very gentle around women. Dominic had offered his services to her organization, and all three had put in hours of work to shut down trafficking and bring girls home to their families. If they\u2019d taken Kinley Kohl, it was for a good reason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Alea smiled at Dane. \u201cGive him a call. See if we can help.\u201d</p><p>It was what she did now. She helped and she opened her heart. She was so much richer for it.</p><p>The baby in her arms wriggled, and she settled in. She had a few hours to be warm and peaceful with her guys. Lan cuddled up beside her as Dane started talking about all their plans. Cooper got under the covers, his hand cupping Mat\u2019s little head.</p><p>Dane stopped at the end of the bed, staring at them. \u201cHey, have I told you you\u2019re beautiful today?\u201d</p> <p>Tears filled her eyes. He said it every single day, and every day she held the words to her heart and believed them just a little more. She nodded and blew him a kiss.</p><p>She was a princess by title, but her men had turned her into a queen. </p>  </body></html>"]
