Gripping the handrail to counterbalance his shaken composure, he rounded a bend in the stairwell and looked at the seraph who ascended abreast of him. With the relaying of the news, Jason Taylor advanced into Phineas\u2019s former rank as Adrian\u2019s second-in-command. \u201cWhen? How?\u201d</p><p>Jason easily kept up with Adrian\u2019s inhuman pace as they approached the roof. \u201cAbout an hour ago. It was called in as a vamp attack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one noticed a vampire within striking distance? How the fuck is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my question. I sent Damien to investigate.\u201d</p><p>They reached the last landing. The lycan guard in front of them pushed open the heavy metal door, and Adrian slipped sunglasses over his eyes before stepping into the Arizona sunshine. He watched the guard recoil from the ovenlike heat, then heard a complaining growl from the second lycan, who brought up the rear. As base creatures of instinct, they were susceptible to physical stimuli in ways the seraphim and vampires were not. Adrian didn\u2019t feel the temperature at all; the loss of Phineas had chilled his blood.</p><p>A helicopter waited on the pad in front of them, its whirring blades churning the oppressively dry and gritty air. Its rounded side was emblazoned with both MITCHELL AERONAUTICS and Adrian\u2019s winged logo.</p><p>\u201cYou have doubts.\u201d He focused on the details because he couldn\u2019t afford to vent his fury now. Inside, he was shattered by grief over the loss of his best friend and trusted lieutenant. But as leader of the Sentinels, he couldn\u2019t appear diminished in any way. Phineas\u2019s death would send ripples through the ranks of his elite unit of seraphim. The Sentinels would be looking to him for strength and guidance.</p> <p>\u201cOne of his lycans survived the attack.\u201d Despite the roar of the aircraft\u2019s engine, Jason didn\u2019t need to raise his voice to be heard. He also didn\u2019t cover his seraph blue eyes, despite the pair of designer shades perched atop his golden head. \u201cI find it a bit . . . odd that Phineas was investigating the size of the Navajo Lake pack; then he gets ambushed on the way home and killed. Yet one of his dogs survives to call it in as a vamp assault?\u201d</p><p>Adrian had been utilizing the lycans for centuries as both guards for the Sentinels and heeler dogs to herd the vampires into designated areas. But recent signs of restlessness among the lycans signaled a need for him to reevaluate. They\u2019d been created for the express purpose of serving his unit. If necessary, Adrian would remind them of the pact made by their ancestors. They could have all been turned into soulless, bloodsucking vampires as punishment for their crimes, but he\u2019d spared them in return for their indenture. Although some of the lycans believed their debt had been paid by their predecessors, they failed to recognize that this world was made for mortals. They could never live among and alongside humans. Their only place was the one Adrian had made for them.</p><p>One of his guards ducked low and pushed through the air turbulence created by the helicopter blades. Reaching the aircraft, the lycan held the door open.</p><p>Adrian\u2019s power buffered him from the tempest, allowing him to proceed without effort. He looked at Jason. \u201cI\u2019ll need to question the lycan who survived the attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell Damien.\u201d The wind whipped through the lieutenant\u2019s blond locks and sent his sunglasses flying.</p><p>Adrian snatched them out of the air with a lightning-quick grasp. Vaulting into the cabin, he settled into one of the two rear-facing bucket seats.</p> <p>Jason occupied the other one. \u201cBut I have to ask: is a guard dog that can\u2019t guard worth anything? Maybe you should put him down to reinforce that by example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s at fault, he\u2019ll pray for death.\u201d Adrian tossed the shades at him. \u201cBut until I know otherwise, he\u2019s a victim and my only witness. I need him if I\u2019m to catch and punish those who did this.\u201d</p><p>The two lycans dropped onto the opposite row of seats. One was stocky, a bruiser. The other was nearly equal in height to Adrian.</p><p>The taller guard secured his seat belt and said, \u201cThat \u2018dog\u2019s\u2019 mate died trying to protect Phineas. If he could\u2019ve done something, he would have.\u201d</p><p>Jason opened his mouth.</p><p>Adrian held up a hand to keep him quiet. \u201cYou\u2019re Elijah.\u201d</p><p>The lycan nodded. He was dark haired and had the luminous green eyes of a creature tainted with the blood of demons. It was one of the points of contention between Adrian and the lycans that he\u2019d transfused their seraph ancestors with demon blood when they\u2019d agreed to serve the Sentinels. That touch of demon was what made them half man/half beast and it had spared the souls that should have died with the amputation of their wings. It also made them mortal, with finite life spans, and there were many who resented him for that.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know more about what happened than Jason does,\u201d Adrian noted, studying the lycan. Elijah had been sent to Adrian\u2019s pack for observation, because he\u2019d displayed unacceptable Alpha traits. The lycans were trained to look to the Sentinels for leadership. If one of their own ever rose to prominence, it might lead to divided loyalties that could spark thoughts of rebellion. The best way to deal with a problem was to prevent it from occurring in the first place.</p> <p>Elijah looked out the window, watching the roof recede as the helicopter lifted high into Phoenix\u2019s cloudless blue sky. His hands were fisted, betraying his breed\u2019s innate fear of flying. \u201cWe all know a mated pair can\u2019t live without each other. No lycan would ever deliberately watch their mate die. Not for any reason.\u201d</p><p>Adrian leaned back, attempting to ease the tension created by restraining wings that wanted to spread and stretch in a physical manifestation of his pained rage. What Elijah had said was true, which left him facing the possibility of a vampire offensive. His head fell back against the seat. The need for vengeance burned like acid. The vampires had taken so much from him\u2014the woman he loved, friends, and fellow Sentinels. The loss of Phineas was akin to severing his right arm. He intended to sever far more than that from the one responsible.</p><p>Knowing his sunglasses wouldn\u2019t hide the flaming irises that betrayed his roiling emotions, he shuttered his gaze . . .</p><p>. . . and almost missed the glint of sunlight on silver.</p><p>He jerked to the side by instinct, narrowly missing a dagger slash to the neck.</p><p>Comprehension flashed. The pilot.</p><p>Adrian caught the arm reaching around his headrest and snapped the bone. A female scream pierced the cabin. The pilot\u2019s broken limb flopped against the leather at an unnatural angle; her blade clattered to the floorboard. Adrian released his harness and spun around, baring his claws. The lycans shot forward, one on either side of him.</p><p>Without a guiding hand at the stick, the helicopter pitched and yawed. Frantic beeping sounded from the cockpit.</p><p>The pilot ignored her useless arm. Using the other, she thrust a second silver dagger through the gap between the two rear-facing seats.</p><p>Bared fangs. Foaming mouth. Bloodshot eyes.</p><p>A goddamned diseased vampire. Distracted by Phineas\u2019s death, he\u2019d made a fucking major oversight.</p><p>The lycans partially shifted, unleashing their beasts in response to the threat. Their roars of aggression reverberated in the confined space. Elijah, hunched by the low roof, pulled back his fist and swung. The impact knocked the pilot into the cyclic stick, shoving it forward. The nose of the helicopter dove, hurtling them toward the ground.</p><p>The wailing alarms were deafening.</p><p>Adrian lunged, tackling the vampress with a midsection hit and smashing her through the cockpit window. Free-falling, they grappled.</p><p>\u201cOne taste, Sentinel,\u201d she sing-songed through froth, her eyes wild as she struggled to bite him with needle-sharp canines.</p><p>He punched into her rib cage, rending flesh and splintering bone. Fisting her pounding heart, he bared his teeth in a smile.</p><p>His wings snapped open in a burst of iridescent white tipped in crimson. Like a parachute deploying, the thirty-foot expanse halted his descent with teeth-rattling abruptness, ripping the beating organ free of the writhing vampire. She plummeted to the earth, trailing acrid smoke and ash as she disintegrated. In his hand, the heart still pumped, spurting viscous blood before losing life and bursting into flame. He crushed the fleshy organ into a pulpy mass, then tossed it aside. It fell in burning embers, billowing away in a glittering cloud.</p><p>The helicopter whined as it spiraled toward the desert floor.</p><p>Tucking his wings in close, Adrian dove toward the aircraft. One lycan peered out the windowless cockpit, his face blanched and eyes glowing green.</p><p>Jason shot out of the damaged helicopter like a bullet. He circled back, his dark gray and burgundy wings a racing shadow across the sky. \u201cWhat are you doing, Captain ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving the lycans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The ferocity of Adrian\u2019s glare was the only answer he deigned to give. Wisely, Jason banked and came around.</p><p>Knowing the beasts would need to be spurred through their innate terror of heights, Adrian compelled the one standing in the cockpit. \u201cJump.\u201d</p><p>The angelic resonance of his voice rumbled across the desert like thunder, demanding undeniable obedience. Mindlessly, the lycan tumbled into the open sky. Arrowing directly toward him, Jason snatched the guard out of harm\u2019s way.</p><p>Elijah needed no compulsion. Exhibiting remarkable courage, the guard launched himself from the doomed aircraft in an elegant dive.</p><p>Adrian swooped under him, grunting as the muscle-heavy lycan slammed onto his back. They were mere feet away from the ground, close enough that the beating of his massive wings sent sand twisting upward in spiraling gusts.</p><p>The helicopter hit the desert floor a heartbeat later, exploding into a roiling tower of flames that could be seen for miles.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>There was a walking wet dream in Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor International Airport.</p><p>Lindsay Gibson spotted him at her boarding gate during a cursory surveillance of her immediate perimeter. Arrested by his raw sensuality, she slowed to a halt in the middle of the concourse. A low whistle of appreciation escaped her. Perhaps her luck was finally turning around. She would certainly welcome a silver lining after the day she\u2019d been having so far. Her takeoff from Raleigh had been delayed almost an hour and she\u2019d missed her original connection. From the looks of it, she had barely made her rebooked flight, if the number of passengers standing by the gate was any indication.</p><p>Finishing her assessment of the crowd around her, Lindsay returned her attention to the most decadent-looking man she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>He paced sinuously along the edge of the waiting area, his long jeans-clad legs maintaining a precisely controlled stride. His thick black hair was slightly overlong, framing a savagely masculine face. A cream-colored V-neck T-shirt stretched over powerfully ripped shoulders, hinting at a body worthy of completing the package.</p><p>Lindsay pushed a lock of rain-damp hair back from her forehead and cataloged every detail. Unadulterated sex appeal\u2014this guy had it. The kind you couldn\u2019t fake or buy; the kind that made handsomeness a bonus.</p><p>He moved without looking, yet unerringly avoided a man who cut through his path. His attention was occupied by a BlackBerry, his thumb rhythmically stroking over the trackpad in a way that caused places low in Lindsay\u2019s belly to clench.</p><p>A drop of rainwater slid down her neck. The cool, slow trickle heightened her physical awareness of the guy she was devouring with her gaze. Behind him, the view of the tarmac revealed a gloomy gray late-afternoon sky. Sheets of rain pelted the windows framing the terminal. The inclement weather was unexpected, and not just because there\u2019d been no rain in the forecast. She always anticipated weather conditions with uncanny accuracy, but she hadn\u2019t felt this storm coming. It had been sunny when she landed, then began pouring buckets shortly after.</p><p>Usually, she loved rain and wouldn\u2019t have minded having to step outside to catch the interterminal bus to her connecting flight\u2019s gate. Today, however, there was a morose quality to the weather. A weight of melancholy, or mourning. And she was empathetic.</p><p>As long as she could remember, the wind had spoken to her. Whether it shouted through a storm or whispered through stillness, it always conveyed its message. Not in words, but in feelings. Her dad called it her sixth sense and he went out of his way to act as if it was a cool quirk to have instead of something freakish.</p><p>That inner radar drew her to the luscious man by her gate as much as his looks did. There was a brooding air about him that reminded her of a brewing storm gathering strength. She was strongly attracted to that quality in him . . . and to the lack of a wedding band on his finger.</p><p>Pivoting, Lindsay faced him head-on and willed him to look at her.</p><p>His head lifted. His gaze met hers.</p><p>She was hit with the sensation of being buffeted by the wind, the gusts whipping through her hair. But there was none of the chill. Only heat and seductive humidity. Lindsay held his stare for an endless moment, riveted by the drawing pull of brilliant azure irises, eyes that were as tumultuous and ancient as the fury of the weather outside.</p><p>Inhaling sharply, she turned and walked to a nearby gourmet pretzel shop, giving him the opportunity to chase her obvious interest . . . or not. She knew instinctively that he was a man who pursued.</p><p>She reached the counter and glanced up at the menu. The smell of warm, yeasty bread and melted butter made her mouth water. The last thing she needed before sitting on her ass for another hour straight was a carbohydrate bomb like a giant pretzel. Then again, maybe the rush of serotonin would soothe nerves jangled by the sensory input from the large number of people around her.</p><p>She ordered. \u201cPretzel sticks, please. With marinara sauce and a diet soda.\u201d</p><p>The clerk relayed the total. Lindsay dug into her purse for her wallet.</p><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><p>God . . . that voice. Tantalizingly sonorous. Lindsay knew it was him.</p><p>He reached around her and she breathed in his exotic scent. Not cologne. Just earthy, virile male. Crisp and pure, like air cleansed by a rainstorm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He slid a twenty-dollar bill across the counter. She smiled and let him.</p><p>It was too bad she was wearing her oldest pair of jeans, a loose T-shirt, and army-issue jungle boots. Great for ease of movement, but she would\u2019ve preferred to look hot for this guy. He really was way out of her league, from the movie-star good looks to the Vacheron Constantin watch on his wrist.</p><p>Turning to face him, she held out her hand. \u201cThank you, Mr. . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian Mitchell.\u201d He accepted the handshake, with the addition of his thumb stroking across her knuckles.</p> <p>Lindsay had a visceral response to his touch. Her breath caught and the tempo of her heartbeat accelerated. Up close, he was devastating. Both fiercely masculine and terrifyingly beautiful. Flawless. \u201cHi, Adrian Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>He reached down and caught her luggage tag with long, elegant fingers. \u201cNice to meet you, Lindsay Gibson . . . from Raleigh? Or returning there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m heading your direction. We\u2019re sharing a plane.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were the most unusual shade of blue. Like the vivid cerulean at the heart of a flame. Set within olive skin and framed by thick dark lashes, they were mesmerizing.</p><p>And they were focused on her as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of looking at her.</p> <p>He raked her from head to toe with a searing glance. She felt bare and flushed, left naked by the undressing he\u2019d done in his mind. Her body responded to the provocation. Her breasts swelled; everything else softened.</p><p>A woman would have to soften for him, because there was nothing remotely yielding about his body. From the sculpted definition of his shoulders and biceps to the chiseled features of his face, every angle was sharp and precise.</p><p>He reached around her for his change, moving with a lithe and primal grace.</p><p>I bet he fucks like an animal.</p><p>Heated by the thought, Lindsay caught the extension handle of her suitcase. \u201cSo is Orange County home? Or are you traveling for business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home. To Anaheim. And you?\u201d</p> <p>She moved to the pickup counter. He followed at a more sedate pace, but there was something inherently determined about the way he came after her. His pre-dacity sent a shiver of expectation through her. Her luck had definitely changed\u2014her final destination was Anaheim, too.</p><p>\u201cOrange County is going to be home. I\u2019m relocating for a job.\u201d She wasn\u2019t going to get as detailed as naming a city. She knew how to protect herself if she had to, but she didn\u2019t want to buy any more trouble than she already had.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a big move. One side of the country to the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was time for a change.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved in a half smile. \u201cHave dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>The velvety resonance to his voice engaged her interest further. He was charismatic and magnetic, two qualities that made short-term relationships memorable.</p><p>She accepted the bag and soda the clerk passed to her. \u201cYou get right to the point. I like that.\u201d</p><p>The calling of their flight number drew her attention back to the gate. A short delay was announced, causing the waiting passengers to shift restlessly. Adrian never took his eyes from her.</p> <p>He gestured to the row of chairs near where he\u2019d been pacing. \u201cWe have time to get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay walked with him over to the seating area. She canvassed the vicinity again, taking brief note of the numerous women following Adrian with their gazes. The sense of him being a leashed tempest was no longer so overwhelming, while outside the rain had abated to a heavy drizzle. The correlation was intriguing.</p><p>Her ferocious reaction to Adrian Mitchell and his unique ability to set off her inner weather radar cemented her decision to get closer to him. Anomalies in her life always bore greater investigation.</p><p>He waited until she was settled into a seat, then asked, \u201cDo you have friends picking you up? Family?\u201d</p><p>No one was meeting her. She had a shuttle reserved to take her to the hotel where she\u2019d be staying until she found a suitable apartment. \u201cIt\u2019s not wise to share that sort of information with a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let me address the risk.\u201d He shifted with sleek fluidity, reaching into his back pocket to grab his billfold. Withdrawing a business card, he held it out to her. \u201cCall whoever is expecting you. Tell them who I am and how to reach me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re determined.\u201d Also used to giving commands. She didn\u2019t mind. She had a strong personality and needed the same in return, or she took the lead. Docile men were fine in certain situations, but not in her personal life.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he agreed, unabashed.</p><p>Lindsay reached for the card. His fingers touched hers and electricity raced up her arm.</p><p>His nostrils flared. He caught her hand; his fingertips teased her palm. He could have been stroking between her legs, given how aroused she became from that simple touch. He watched her with an almost tangible sexual heat, dark and intense. As if he knew what her hot buttons were . . . or was set on figuring them out.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you\u2019re going to be trouble,\u201d she murmured, tightening her grip to still his questing fingers.</p><p>\u201cDinner. Conversation. I promise to behave.\u201d</p><p>Holding him captive, she reached for his business card with her other hand. Her blood was thrumming through her veins, roused by the excitement of such an immediate, unruly attraction. \u201cMitchell Aeronautics,\u201d she read. \u201cBut you\u2019re flying commercial?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had other plans.\u201d His tone was wry. \u201cBut my pilot dropped out unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>His pilot. Her mouth curved. \u201cDon\u2019t you hate when that happens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsually . . . Then you came along.\u201d He pulled his BlackBerry out of his pocket. \u201cUse my phone so whoever you call will have that number, too.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay reluctantly released him and accepted the phone, even though she had her own. Setting her soda on the worn carpet, she stood. Adrian rose with her. He was affluent, elegant, mannered, solicitous, and drop-dead gorgeous. Yet as polished as he was, there remained a dangerous edge to him that titillated a woman\u2019s basest instincts. Maybe the crowded terminal was provoking her sharp senses. Or maybe they just had a combustible sexual compatibility. Regardless, she wasn\u2019t complaining.</p><p>Leaving her pretzel bag on the chair, she moved a few feet away and dialed the number to her father\u2019s auto shop. While she was occupied, Adrian walked to the gate counter.</p><p>\u201cLinds. You\u2019re there already?\u201d</p><p>She was startled by the abrupt greeting. \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaller ID. It shows a 714 area code.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my layover in Phoenix, using someone else\u2019s cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with yours? And why are you still in Phoenix?\u201d A single parent for twenty years, Eddie Gibson had always been overprotective, which wasn\u2019t surprising considering the horrific manner of Regina Gibson\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cMy phone\u2019s fine and I missed my connection. I\u2019ve also met someone.\u201d Lindsay explained the situation with Adrian and relayed the information from the business card. \u201cI\u2019m not worried. He just seems like the kind of guy who could use a little resistance. I don\u2019t think he hears the word \u2018no\u2019 very often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. Mitchell is like Howard Hughes.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cHow so? Money, movies, starlets? All of the above?\u201d</p><p>She assessed Adrian from the back, taking advantage of the opportunity to check him out while his attention was diverted. The rear view was as impressive as the front, revealing a powerful back and a luscious ass.</p><p>\u201cIf you sat still for more than five minutes, you might know this,\u201d her father said.</p><p>God, she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d read a magazine, and she had stopped paying for cable television years ago. She rented movies and shows by the season, because even commercials were a luxury she couldn\u2019t make room for. \u201cI can barely keep my own life straight, Dad. Where am I supposed to find time to pay attention to someone else\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always poking into mine,\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cI know you. I love you. Celebrities? Not so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a celebrity. He actually guards his privacy pretty fiercely. He lives on some kind of compound in Orange County. I saw it on a television special once. It\u2019s some sort of architectural wonder. Mitchell is similar to Hughes in that he\u2019s a reclusive gazillionaire who likes planes. The media keeps tabs on him because the public has a fascination with aviators. They always have. And he\u2019s supposedly attractive, but I can\u2019t judge that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>And to think she\u2019d picked him out of a crowd. \u201cThanks for the heads-up. I\u2019ll call you when I get settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can take care of yourself, but be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. Don\u2019t eat fast food for dinner. Cook something healthy. Better yet, meet a hot chick and have her cook for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinds . . .\u201d he began in a mock warning tone.</p><p>Laughing, she ended the call, then went into the phone\u2019s history and deleted the number.</p><p>Adrian approached with a ghost of a smile. He moved so fluidly, exuding power and confidence, which she found even more attractive than his looks. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He held out a boarding pass. Lindsay saw her name and frowned.</p><p>\u201cI took the liberty,\u201d he explained, \u201cof arranging adjacent seats.\u201d</p><p>She took the ticket. First class. Seat number two, which was more than twenty rows closer to the front of the plane than she\u2019d had originally. \u201cI can\u2019t pay for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect you to foot the bill for a change you didn\u2019t ask for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need photo ID to mess with someone\u2019s ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I pulled a few strings.\u201d He retrieved the phone she handed to him. \u201cAre you okay with that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but her inner warning light lit up. With TSA security being what it was, it should\u2019ve taken an act of God to change her ticket without her permission. Perhaps the gate attendant had simply succumbed to Adrian\u2019s allure or maybe he\u2019d seriously greased her palm, but Lindsay never ignored alarm bells. She was going to have to dig deeper where he was concerned, and she would really have to think twice about what she\u2019d hoped would be a short and sweet, hot and raunchy, no strings attached affair.</p><p>Frankly, there was no need for a guy like Adrian to go to any trouble to get into her pants. Every woman in the terminal was eyeing him, some with the sort of searching glance that said, Give me the slightest encouragement and I\u2019m yours. Shit, even some of the men were looking at him like that. And he handled the prurient interest so deftly that Lindsay knew it was par for the course for him. He kept his gaze moving, never lingering, while wearing an air of indifference that acted like a shield. She\u2019d arrowed right through it with her direct come-and-get-it eye contact, but it truly made no sense that he\u2019d taken her bait. She was rain damp and scruffily dressed. Yes, self-assurance was a lure for powerful men, and she had it, but that didn\u2019t explain why she felt as if she was the one who\u2019d been snared.</p><p>\u201cJust so we\u2019re clear,\u201d she began, \u201cI was raised to expect men to open doors, pull out chairs, and pick up the tab. In return, I dress nice and try to be charming. That\u2019s as far as it goes. You can\u2019t buy sex from me. Work for you?\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved in that now familiar almost-smile. \u201cPerfectly. We\u2019ll have an hour to talk on the plane. If you aren\u2019t completely comfortable with me by the time we land, I\u2019ll settle for an exchange of phone numbers. Otherwise, I have a car picking me up and we can leave the airport together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>His gaze held a hint of self-satisfaction. Lindsay kept her similar response in check. Whatever else he may be and whatever his motives were, Adrian Mitchell was a challenge she relished.</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I have her. Adrian savored a ferocious surge of triumph.</p><p>If Lindsay Gibson knew how predatory and rapaciously sexual his sense of conquest was, she might have thought twice about having dinner with him. His first urge upon seeing her had been to press her against the most convenient flat surface and take her swift and hard. To her, they were meeting for the first time. In truth, they were reuniting after two hundred years apart. Two hellish centuries of waiting and craving.</p><p>Today, of all days. Life had a way of grabbing him by the balls at the most in-fucking-convenient times. But he couldn\u2019t bitch about this\u2014would never bitch about it.</p><p>Shadoe, my love.</p><p>They had never been apart this length of time before. Their reunions were always random and unpredictable, yet inexorable. Their souls were drawn to each other despite the disparate roads their lives were traveling.</p><p>The endless cycle of her deaths and her inability to remember what they meant to each other was his punishment for having broken the law he\u2019d been created to enforce. It was an excruciatingly effective reprisal. He was dying in slow degrees; his soul\u2014the core of his angelic existence\u2014was ravaged by grief, rage, and a thirst for vengeance. Each time he lost Shadoe, and every day he was forced to live without her, further compromised his ability to carry out his mission. Her absence impaired the commitment to duty that was the cornerstone of who he was\u2014a soldier, a leader, and the gaoler of beings as powerful as he was.</p><p>Two hundred damned years. She\u2019d been gone long enough to make him dangerous. A seraph whose heart was encased in ice was a hazard to everyone and everything around him. He was a danger to her, because his hunger for her was so voracious he questioned his ability to restrain it. When she was gone, the world was dead to him. The silence within was deafening. Then she returned, and the rush of sensation exploded around him\u2014the pounding of his heart, the heat of her touch, the force of his need. Life. Which was lost to him when she was.</p><p>As they returned to their seats, Lindsay said, \u201cMy dad says you\u2019re the Howard Hughes of my generation.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Impatience clawed at him. Discussing his necessary but meaningless facade after the events of the day was both perverse and anguishing. He was beyond agitated, his blood flowing thick and hot with fury and driving hunger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m less eccentric,\u201d he replied in a voice that betrayed none of his volatility. Every cell in his body was attuned to Lindsay Gibson\u2014the vessel carrying the soul he loved. The illicit physical needs of his human shell had roused with vicious alacrity, reminding him how long it had been since she\u2019d last been in his arms. He could never forget how good it was between them. A single scorching glance could set off an incendiary hunger that took hours to burn out.</p><p>He craved those intimate hours with her. Craved her.</p><p>While Shadoe\u2019s physical form reflected the genetics of Lindsay\u2019s family line, he felt and recognized her regardless of the body she was born into. Over the years, her appearance and ethnicity had varied widely, yet his love burned undiminished regardless. His attraction was borne of the connection he felt to her, the sense of finding the other half of himself.</p> <p>Lindsay shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t mind eccentric. Makes things interesting.\u201d</p><p>Raindrops glistened in her hair. She was a blonde in this incarnation, with tousled curls that were sexy as hell. The length was short, about four inches all around. His hands clenched against the desire to fist the lush mass, to hold her motionless while his mouth slanted over hers and quenched his desperate thirst for the taste of her.</p><p>He was in love with Shadoe\u2019s soul, but Lindsay Gibson was inciting a blistering lust. The combined response was devastating, blindsiding him when he was already on edge. His spine shifted with restless awareness, forcing him to restrain wings wanting to flex in sinuous pleasure at the sight and smell of her. Sitting beside her on the plane would be both heaven and hell.</p><p>He had the advantage of remembering every one of their past relationships, but Lindsay had only her instincts to go on, and they were clearly sending her signals she wasn\u2019t sure how to process. Her nostrils flared gently, her pupils were dilated, and her body language confirmed her reciprocating attraction. She watched him carefully, assessing him. There was no coyness to her. She was bold and self-assured. Definitely comfortable in her own skin. He liked her immensely already, and knew that would be the case regardless of his history with Shadoe.</p><p>\u201cWhere in Orange County are you heading?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd what was the draw worth uprooting for?\u201d</p> <p>Although Adrian knew her as deeply as any man could know his woman, in most ways he was starting from scratch every time he found her again. Lindsay\u2019s likes and dislikes, her personality and temperament, her memories were unique to her. Every reunion was a rediscovery.</p><p>She peeled back the flimsy plastic top to her soda cup and took a sip. \u201cAnaheim. I work in hospitality, so Southern California tourism is right up my alley.\u201d</p><p>He gave the appearance of reaching into his back pocket. With his hand behind him, he summoned a straw and then presented it to her. \u201cRestaurants or hotels?\u201d</p><p>How did she take her coffee? Did she even enjoy coffee ? Did she sleep on her back or her stomach? Where did she like to be touched? Was she a night owl or an early riser?</p><p>Lindsay stared at the straw, then arched a brow at him. She accepted it and tore into the protective paper, but was clearly wondering when he\u2019d picked it up. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p> <p>There was so much to assimilate and an unknown amount of time in which to work. Once, she\u2019d come back to him for twenty minutes; another time, twenty years. Her father always found her. The leader of the vampires was as drawn to her as Adrian was, and Syre was determined to finish what he\u2019d started. He wanted to make his daughter immortal through vampirism, which would kill the soul connecting her to Adrian.</p><p>That would never fucking happen as long as Adrian was breathing.</p><p>\u201cHotels,\u201d she answered, returning to his question. \u201cI love the energy. They never sleep, never close. The endless flow of travelers ensures there\u2019s always another challenge to tackle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Belladonna. It\u2019s a new resort near Disneyland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOwned by Gadara Enterprises.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. Raguel Gadara was a real estate mogul rivaling Steve Wynn and Donald Trump. All of his new developments were heavily advertised, but even without the publicity, Adrian knew Raguel well. Not just through their secular lives, but also through their celestial ones. Raguel was one of the seven earthbound archangels, falling several rungs below Adrian\u2019s rank of seraph in the angelic hierarchy.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s dark eyes brightened. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaguel is an old acquaintance.\u201d He began planning the steps required to research her history from birth until this moment. There were no coincidences in his world. He found Shadoe in every reincarnation not due to chance, but because they were destined to cross paths. But to move so near to his headquarters and end up in an angel\u2019s employ . . . ? Raguel owned properties all over the world, including resorts closer to her home on the East Coast. It could not be accidental that circumstances contrived to bring her to Orange County.</p> <p>Adrian needed to know the opportunities and decisions that led her so directly into his life. The discovery process was one he undertook whenever she returned. He looked for routines or patterns applicable to her former lives. He gained knowledge used to build her trust and affection. And he searched for any sign that they were being manipulated, because the time was fast approaching when he would have to pay for his hubris. He had committed the transgression he\u2019d censured others for: he had fallen in love with Shadoe\u2014a naphil, the child of a mortal woman and the angel her father had once been\u2014and he\u2019d succumbed, countless times, to the decadent sins of her flesh.</p><p>He had personally punished her father for the same offense. He\u2019d severed the wings from the fallen angel, an act that took Syre\u2019s soul and made him the first of the vampires.</p><p>The consequences of Adrian\u2019s hypocrisy would eventually catch up with him; it was an inevitability he\u2019d accepted long ago. If Raguel was the means the Creator intended to use to rebuke him, Adrian needed to know and be prepared. He had to ensure that Shadoe would be taken care of when his time came.</p><p>His gaze met those of his lycan guards, who were sitting a few rows away on either side. They were observant, curious. They couldn\u2019t help but see that he was reacting differently to Lindsay than he did to other women. The last time Shadoe\u2019s soul had been with him, neither of the two lycans had been born yet, but they knew his personal life. They knew how little attention he paid to the opposite sex.</p><p>He would need more than two guards now that he could resume his hunt for Syre, and Lindsay would need her own dedicated protection. Adrian knew he\u2019d have to manipulate that carefully. She was young\u2014twenty-five at most\u2014and starting out on her own in a new place. Now was the time for her to broaden her horizons, not find out that her new lover was micromanaging her life.</p><p>Lindsay rolled her straw between her fingers, her soft pink lips hovering momentarily before parting for a sip.</p><p>A wash of heat swept over him. Even the knowledge that he would lose her again, that he was forsaking his duty once again, couldn\u2019t dampen the rush of desire quickening his blood. He wanted those lips on his skin, needed to feel them sliding across his flesh, whispering both raw and tender words as they teased him mercilessly. Although the Sentinels had been forbidden to love and mate with mortals, nothing could convince Adrian that Shadoe hadn\u2019t been born to belong to him.</p><p>She talked to her dad on the phone . . .</p><p>He grew very still.</p><p>Adrian kept his face impassive, but he was intensely alert. Shadoe\u2019s various incarnations had always been raised by a single-parent mother, never by a father. It was as if Syre had marked her soul when he\u2019d begun the Change that would have transformed her into a vampire, ensuring that no other man would ever take his paternal role in her life. \u201cAre your parents in Raleigh?\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over her features. \u201cMy dad is. My mother died when I was five.\u201d</p><p>His fingers flexed restlessly. The order of her parents\u2019 deaths had never been mutable.</p><p>His long-stable world had canted that morning, and Lindsay Gibson continued to challenge his balance, causing the objects around him to begin a slow slide away from their predetermined place. The lycans had been growing more agitated by the day, the vampires had crossed a precipitous line with the death of Phineas and the attack in the helicopter, and now Shadoe had returned after an interminable absence with the most basic pattern of her reincarnations altered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for your loss,\u201d he murmured, adopting the customary remark offered to grieving mortals who so often viewed death as a sorrowful ending.</p><p>\u201cThank you. How about your family? Big or small?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig. Lots of siblings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI envy you. I don\u2019t have any brothers or sisters. My dad didn\u2019t remarry. He never got over my mom.\u201d</p><p>Adrian had become adept at winning over her mothers. Men, however, tended to give him a wide berth regardless of any efforts he made to put them at ease. They instinctively sensed the power in him; there could be only one Alpha in a designated space, and he was it. Gaining acceptance from her father might take some work, but it would be worth the time and investment. Familial support was just one of the many avenues he utilized to gain her complete and total surrender, which was the only way he could bear to have her. No holds barred.</p><p>He touched the back of her hand where it rested lightly on the armrest, relishing the charge he got from the simple contact. He heard the elevated beat of her heart as if his ear were pressed to her chest. Over the paging of flight information, boarding calls, and gate changes, the strong and steady rhythm of her heartbeat was crystal clear and deeply beloved. \u201cSome women are unforgettable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like a romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that surprise you?\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved gently. \u201cNothing surprises me.\u201d</p><p>His heart ached at that smile. He\u2019d gone too long without her, and his wait was hardly over. While she couldn\u2019t fail to feel the pull between them, she didn\u2019t love him. He\u2019d have only her body for a time, which would soothe the sharpest edge of his need but still leave him wanting.</p><p>His attention diverted to Elijah, who\u2019d pushed to his feet and moved off the carpeted waiting area to the main concourse. The lycans were uncomfortable in enclosed, crowded spaces. Adrian could have chartered a flight or waited for one of his own planes\u2014either action would have spared his guards their discomfort\u2014but he\u2019d needed to send a message to any vampire stupid enough to think he might have been weakened by the aerial ambush or the loss of his second: Come and try me again.</p><p>\u201cYou love surprises,\u201d she guessed.</p><p>Adrian looked at her. \u201cHate them. Except when they\u2019re you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay laughed softly. A forgotten warmth stirred in his chest.</p><p>A young woman pushing a stroller and carrying a fussy infant headed toward the gate counter via the carpeted pathway directly in front of them. As she argued with a toddler dragging a small carry-on, Adrian\u2019s phone rang. He excused himself from Lindsay and stepped a short distance away.</p><p>The caller ID on his phone showed a number, but no name. \u201cMitchell,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d The icy voice was instantly recognizable.</p><p>Primal aggression spurred Adrian\u2019s pulse. Lightning split the sky in tandem, followed by the roar of thunder. \u201cSyre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have something that belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Turning his head with feigned nonchalance, Adrian searched for surveillance. Was it possible Syre had found his daughter first and was tracking her? \u201cWhat might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be coy, Adrian. It doesn\u2019t suit you. Lovely brunette. Female. Petite. You will give her back\u2014unharmed.\u201d</p><p>Adrian relaxed. \u201cIf you\u2019re referring to the rabid, foaming-at-the-mouth bitch who attacked me today, I broke her heart. Crushed it in my fist, to be precise.\u201d</p><p>There was a long, terrible stretch of silence. Then, \u201cNikki was the kindest woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s your definition of \u2018kind,\u2019 I\u2019ve been too lenient. Try a stunt like that again,\u201d he warned smoothly, \u201cand I\u2019ll put you all down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t the authority or the right. Watch that God complex of yours, Adrian, or you\u2019ll end up like me.\u201d</p><p>Turning away from Lindsay\u2019s vigilant gaze, Adrian breathed carefully through his seething wrath. He was a seraph, a Sentinel. He was expected to stand above the vagaries of human emotions. Betraying otherwise\u2014through his tone of voice or actions\u2014exposed an unconscionable vulnerability. What was done could not be undone; his mortal love tethered him to the earth, holding him away from the serenity of the heavens.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019m authorized to do,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cShe attacked in broad daylight, proving that one of your Fallen ranks\u2014maybe you\u2014fed her in the last forty-eight hours. That opens the door for me to defend myself and my Sentinels in whatever manner I see fit. Think harder before sending another suicidal minion my way. I\u2019m not Phineas; you and I have already established that a fight with me is one you can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>It was the truth . . . albeit oversimplified. Syre lacked the formal combat training that honed the Sentinels, but he\u2019d had centuries to perfect guerrilla tactics. He was also older and wiser for his mistakes, and growing as restless as the lycans. His vampires would follow him into Hell if he asked them to. All of which made him exceedingly dangerous. While Adrian knew he could best Syre again, it would not be as easily accomplished the next time.</p><p>And Lindsay Gibson would be caught in the middle.</p><p>\u201cMaybe winning isn\u2019t the goal,\u201d Syre taunted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Casting a possessive glance at Lindsay, Adrian was acutely aware of the misery he was destined to bring into her life. But he couldn\u2019t walk away. Between himself and Syre, he was the lesser of two evils.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a death wish,\u201d Adrian said, as thunder rumbled across the sky, \u201cpay me a visit. I\u2019m happy to assist.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay frowned at something, and he followed her gaze. The woman with the antsy kids was still fighting with the elder. The boy\u2019s voice rose to a volume that drew attention from everyone in the immediate area.</p><p>The vampire leader laughed. \u201cNot until I\u2019m certain my daughter is free of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour death will take care of that.\u201d</p><p>Adrian would forever curse the weakness that had driven him to Syre when Shadoe was fatally wounded. He\u2019d mistakenly believed the Fallen leader\u2019s love for his child would ensure he would act in her best interests, but Syre\u2019s thirst for vengeance was as all-consuming as his thirst for blood. He would do anything to prevent his daughter from bringing happiness to the Sentinel who\u2019d punished him. He\u2019d attempted to turn her into a vampire like himself\u2014a soulless, bloodsucking creature who would have to live in darkness for eternity\u2014rather than allow her to love Adrian with her mortal soul.</p><p>Once Adrian had realized Syre\u2019s intent, he\u2019d stopped the Change, with unforeseen consequences\u2014her body had died, but her naphil soul had been immortalized. The partial Change had caused Shadoe to return again and again in an endless cycle of reincarnation, because, unlike a mortal, her soul was half angelic but independent of wings. Mortal souls died with the Change and angel souls died with the loss of their wings, but the nephalim had neither vulnerability. When Shadoe\u2019s body had been prevented from completing the transformation, her naphil soul survived to remain tied to the individual who\u2019d sired her into vampirism. Killing her father should free her by severing Syre\u2019s hold on her soul; only the vampire who initiated a Change could complete it.</p><p>But time was Adrian\u2019s enemy. He had only Lindsay\u2019s uncertain life span in which to work. It was a terribly small window for an immortal.</p><p>\u201cSelfish bastard,\u201d the vampire hissed. \u201cYou would rather Shadoe die than live forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you would rather she suffer your punishment, even though she doesn\u2019t deserve it. You broke the law, not her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she, though, Adrian? She lured you to fall as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe decision was mine. Therefore the fault is mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you don\u2019t suffer as we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d Adrian challenged softly. \u201cHow would you know what I suffer, Syre?\u201d</p><p>He looked at Lindsay again. She watched him from her seat with those dark eyes that seemed to catch everything. They were far too worldly for a person of her age.</p> <p>Her brows arched in silent inquiry.</p><p>He affected a reassuring smile. She was as attuned to him as he was to her, but she couldn\u2019t recall the history between them that had created the affinity. He would have to take care not to cause her concern or distress. His mercurial emotions were a sign of how far he\u2019d fallen. They were a testament to how human his love for her had made him. The heavens lamented his mortal weakness through the weather\u2014raining when he mourned, thundering when he raged, the temperature fluctuating with the heat or chill of his moods.</p><p>\u201cYou covet her soul,\u201d Syre purred, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the one thing that binds her to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you won\u2019t let me bring her into full awareness. Why is that, Adrian? What are you afraid of? That she\u2019ll weaken you all over again?\u201d</p><p>Nearby, the defiant young boy kicked his mother in the shin. She cried out. The startled baby in her arms flailed backward. Off balance and clearly beyond frustrated, the frazzled young woman lost her grip on the child.</p><p>Adrian rushed forward, forcing himself to move at a natural human pace\u2014</p><p>\u2014but Lindsay caught the infant first. Too swiftly. So damn swiftly it seemed as if the baby had never been in danger of hitting the floor at all. The mother blinked, her open mouth betraying her confusion at finding Lindsay directly in front of her instead of seated a few feet away.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget,\u201d Syre continued, \u201cthat soul you prize is clawing to the surface with every incarnation whether I help it along or not. Can you get to me before my daughter regains sentience? What will Shadoe think of you when it all comes back to her and she remembers the pain of the many lives you\u2019ve cost her? Will she still love you then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t forget anything. I certainly won\u2019t forget what you owe me for the losses I\u2019ve been dealt today.\u201d Adrian killed the call, his focus narrowing on the woman who\u2019d just revealed a colossal complication with her preternatural speed. Shadoe\u2019s naphil gifts were strong in Lindsay, suggesting a deeper entwining of the two women than had been manifested in previous incarnations.</p><p>He was running out of time. Souls grew in power with age and experience. It was an inescapable fact that Shadoe would one day have the strength to overpower the soul of the vessel she occupied.</p><p>None of them was prepared for that.</p><p>Shoving the phone in his pocket, Adrian closed the distance between them.</p><p>Adrian Mitchell had immaculate feet.</p><p>From her ridiculously comfortable seat in first class, Lindsay stared at the end of Adrian\u2019s long, stretched out legs and realized she\u2019d never paid much attention to a man\u2019s feet before. Usually, she thought they were ugly: callused skin, crooked toes, absently trimmed and yellowed nails. Not Adrian\u2019s. His feet were flawless in every way. In fact, everything about him was precisely symmetrical and expertly crafted. It was arresting how perfect he was.</p><p>Looking up, she met his gaze and smiled. She didn\u2019t explain her preoccupation with his sandaled feet. It didn\u2019t seem necessary, considering the way he was looking at her. The sexual attraction was a given. It was hot and edgy and made her body go a little haywire, but there was something softer in his regard, too. Something tender, almost intimate. She responded to it with fierce propriety. A primitive part of her was growling, He\u2019s mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating your pretzel,\u201d he noted, with that low sonorous articulation that made her want to settle in and stay a while.</p><p>He was so stringently contained, rigidly controlled. Even when she sensed turmoil in him, he gave no outward indication of it. His voice was always smooth and even, his posture relaxed and confident. Even when he\u2019d been pacing, he had done so leisurely. The combination of that tight leash and his unrestrained sexuality was a potent turn-on.</p><p>It was her nature to make waves and stir things up, and she was going to do that with him. She was going to dig beneath that calm surface, because she was pretty damn certain still waters ran deep in him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want it?\u201d she offered. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin my appetite.\u201d</p><p>His eyes sparkled with amusement and she realized he had yet to smile fully. Her life was dark enough as it was; she usually went for guys who were lighthearted and fun-loving. It was a testament to his appeal that his subdued intensity didn\u2019t dampen her interest.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like for dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAnything. I\u2019m easy.\u201d The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them. \u201cThat came out wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever worry about what you say around me, as long as you\u2019re honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonesty is my policy, which gets me in trouble a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome trouble is worth getting into.\u201d</p><p>She twisted within her slackened seat belt, canting her torso toward him. \u201cWhat kind of trouble do you get into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe epic kind,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>The faint touch of humor hit all her hot buttons. \u201cI\u2019m intrigued. Tell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s third-date material. You\u2019ll have to stick around.\u201d</p><p>What would it be like to keep a man like Adrian? Just for a little while . . . \u201cThat\u2019s extortion.\u201d</p><p>He looked completely unrepentant. \u201cI\u2019m ruthless about getting what I want, which leads me back to the topic of what to cook for dinner. What\u2019s your guilty pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cooking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you object.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved. Adrian was clearly used to getting his way with no questions asked. \u201cI should probably deny you at some point, just to keep you in your place.\u201d</p><p>His gaze smoldered. \u201cAnd where would that be? The place where you\u2019d like to put me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe place where I set the pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Lindsay gave an approving nod. He was becoming more approachable by the minute. More real. \u201cAs for dinner at your place, I\u2019m okay with that. But I want you to decide what\u2019s on the menu. Impress me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo allergies? Nothing off-limits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of liver, bugs, or meat that\u2019s still bleeding.\u201d Her nose wrinkled. \u201cAside from that, you\u2019ve got carte blanche.\u201d</p><p>Her stipulations elicited his first real smile. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of blood either.\u201d</p><p>The sensual curving of his lips caused heat to spread outward from her tummy, pushing languidness through her limbs even as it gave her a potent headrush. She felt flushed and totally smitten.</p><p>It figured that the one guy to set her off like a rocket was also one who obviously had a lot more to him than met the eye.</p><p>As if what met the eye wasn\u2019t enough . . .</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need bodyguards?\u201d</p><p>Adrian lifted his shoulder in an offhand shrug, his gaze trained on Lindsay as it had been since they\u2019d entered his local organic grocery. She was long and lean, athletic. Her body was a credit to the Creator, and she kept it in prime shape. The way she carried her weight on her feet was notable for its predaceous grace. While her outward appearance was relaxed, he sensed the edge to her. His mood was affecting her strongly, yet she rolled with it, maintaining an admirable level of control.</p><p>She was in a lot better state than he was.</p><p>Shadoe\u2019s return was shredding his equanimity. Shopping for dinner ingredients seemed absurd, considering the violent need tensing every muscle in his body. Here, finally, was the one woman who made him hunger and crave and feel as no other could. The one woman capable of making him acutely aware of every second of his two hundred years of celibacy . . . and he couldn\u2019t have her. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cNotoriety leads to unwanted attention,\u201d he explained with studious evenness.</p><p>Which was why he avoided going out in public when Shadoe wasn\u2019t with him. He did so now because it served a variety of purposes\u2014it continued his campaign to appear unfazed by the morning\u2019s attack, it established normalcy and intimacy with Lindsay, and it gave her the opportunity to select the ingredients she preferred.</p><p>She glanced at the lycans who stood on either end of the produce section. \u201cDangerous attention? Your bullet catchers are pretty big guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. Nothing for you to worry about. I\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I scared easily\u201d\u2014Lindsay picked up a sweet potato and dropped it into a plastic produce bag\u2014\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have left the airport in a strange city with a guy I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She knew him, even if she didn\u2019t realize why or how. It was obvious she relied on her gut instincts more than black-and-white reasoning, and that intuition was filling in the blanks on his behalf. She\u2019d taken one look at him and set her sights. No hesitation. Just a straight-up, in-your-face I want you look that had volleyed the ball into his court with a rapid-fire salvo.</p><p>Lindsay gestured at the nearly overflowing handbasket he was carrying. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to watching you cook all this and seeing if I can pick up a few tips on how to prepare tempura, which is one of my favorite dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you cook?\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh. \u201cStovetop stuff. Nothing complicated. With a single-parent dad and a crazy college schedule, I\u2019ve eaten out more than I\u2019ve eaten in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll change that.\u201d He reached for a Mayan sweet onion, then deliberately allowed it to tumble from his grasp.</p><p>She snatched it out of the air with nearly the same speed he\u2019d used to catch Jason\u2019s flying sunglasses earlier.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d Lindsay tossed the vegetable to him, then turned away as if nothing extraordinary had happened.</p><p>His hand fisted and the onion burst within his palm like a raw eggshell. As the fragrant juice flowed over his fingers, he cursed and willed the mess into a waste bin across the room with a terse thought.</p><p>Lindsay pivoted at the sound, turning so fluidly that her canvas messenger bag didn\u2019t sway from her side. She\u2019d withdrawn the large carryall from her checked luggage the moment she tugged it off the baggage carousel. Her haste had roused his curiosity. Why not carry it on the plane if the need for it was that immediate?</p><p>Adrian studied her. Her economy of movement was impressive. And worrisome. \u201cYou have great reflexes.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shifted downward. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have played professional sports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought about it.\u201d Grabbing a bag of carrots, she placed it in his basket. \u201cBut I lack stamina.\u201d</p><p>He knew why. Lindsay\u2019s mortal body wasn\u2019t built to sustain Shadoe\u2019s naphil gifts. What he didn\u2019t know was if she had just the speed or if there were other talents.</p><p>A sense of urgency swept over him. He had to take out Syre as soon as possible.</p><p>Even knowing how drastically, perhaps catastrophically, the world would change when he killed the leader of the vampires, Adrian wasn\u2019t deterred. Shadoe took precedence over everything. He\u2019d made the mistake of putting himself first the night he attempted to circumvent her death; he would not be so selfish a second time.</p><p>But the cost would be high.</p><p>His mission was to contain and control the Fallen, not execute them. When he ended Syre\u2019s life, he would be pulled from the earth for disobeying his orders, leaving the Sentinels without the captain they\u2019d served under from their inception. The two factions\u2014vampires and angels\u2014would both be leaderless for a time, throwing the world into temporary chaos. But Shadoe\u2019s soul would be freed of its enchainment to her father, and Adrian\u2019s hypocrisy would be at an end. The mistake he\u2019d made so long ago would finally be rectified. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In many ways, his actions would rebalance the scales. He and Syre had both proven unworthy of their leadership. Both the Fallen and the Sentinels deserved captains above reproach, individuals who could lead by example.</p><p>His cell phone rang. Pulling it out of his pocket, Adrian saw it was Jason. He apologized for the need to take the call, but Lindsay just shooed him off and continued on without him.</p><p>\u201cMitchell,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cDamien\u2019s flight is about to take off. He\u2019ll be home in a couple hours.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian knew everyone was moving as swiftly as possible, but that did little to temper his impatience. Phineas\u2019s death demanded swift retaliation, but he needed detailed information to begin his hunt. Damien had been the first Sentinel on the scene and he would have the surviving lycan in tow. They would be his starting point. \u201cI have Shadoe.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then a whistle. \u201cThe timing is perfect. Gives us some leverage if Syre\u2019s finally decided to go rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Adrian\u2019s spine rippled with tension. As distasteful as it was to use Lindsay as a lure to gain access to Syre, there was no denying that she was the best means of manipulating her vampire father into a vulnerable position. \u201cWe\u2019re in public now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I tell Damien to report to your office in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see him the minute he comes in. This is our primary focus until we find the one responsible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the pilot? Do we know what happened there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was thrown off the roof just before we cleared the stairs. It\u2019s all over the local news in Phoenix now.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Adrian rolled his shoulders back. \u201cHave HR send me his file; I want his family well taken care of. And get PR on damage control. His loved ones don\u2019t need to be hounded by the media now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it, Captain. Catch you in a bit.\u201d</p><p>Goaded to get Lindsay back to Angels\u2019 Point as soon as possible, he returned his attention to her and found her gone from the produce section. He approached the second lycan. \u201cWhy is she out of your sight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElijah\u2019s with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the car and wait out front.\u201d</p><p>The lycan nodded and left. Adrian walked the length of the front of the store, looking down each aisle for short golden curls and a svelte figure. He spotted Elijah standing at the back wall, a formidable sight with his wide stance and crossed arms. Lindsay wasn\u2019t with him.</p><p>Closing the distance between them in less time than it took to blink, Adrian asked, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom. Where\u2019s Trent?\u201d</p><p>Adrian was struck again by the confidence and command with which the lycan carried himself, an innate self-assurance that had enabled Elijah to swan dive out of a plummeting helicopter despite his terror of heights. It was also responsible for drawing attention to him as a possible Alpha in the lycan ranks.</p><p>Deliberately testing him, Adrian replied with provocative disregard and vagueness. \u201cObeying orders.\u201d</p><p>Elijah nodded curtly, hiding any adverse reaction he might have had to the nonanswer. \u201cThere\u2019s a demon in the store. One of the night clerks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot our problem.\u201d North America was Raguel Gadara\u2019s territory. It was the seven archangels\u2019 responsibility to police demons. Adrian had been created solely to hunt renegade angels. Aside from Sammael\u2014or Satan, as he\u2019d become known to mortals\u2014most demons were unworthy prey for a Sentinel.</p><p>\u201cI think this one might be a concern. He was trailing the woman around the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep an eye on him. And escort Lindsay to me the moment she comes out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to watch her? What about you?\u201d</p><p>Stopping when they were shoulder to shoulder, Adrian turned his head and met the lycan\u2019s gaze. He knew Elijah wasn\u2019t concerned about his well-being so much as curious about Lindsay\u2019s importance. \u201cI can manage on my own for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>He continued on, stopping in the Asian food section before rounding the endcap. He was halfway through the baking supplies aisle when Lindsay appeared at the end. Elijah was directly behind her.</p><p>\u201cWe have everything we need,\u201d Adrian told her, \u201cunless you have some requests.\u201d</p><p>She paused midstep. Although her pose appeared casual and relaxed on the surface, he felt the razor-sharp tension in her. An inexplicable breeze ruffled the thickest blond curl draping over her brow.</p><p>He sensed the demon behind him before Lindsay spoke.</p><p>Her brown eyes turned as dark and hard as black onyx. \u201cBack away from him, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Power rippled down Adrian\u2019s spine and spread outward, disabling the security cameras in the store with an electrical surge. Elijah bared his canines in a savage snarl.</p><p>\u201cCall off your dog and bitch, seraph,\u201d the demon hissed behind him. \u201cI don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Lindsay snapped. \u201cI can feel the evil in you.\u201d</p><p>Adrian made a quarter turn, affording him a simultaneous view of both Lindsay and the creature she was bristling at\u2014a dragon whose hands flexed beside his thighs, preparing to expel the not inconsiderable firepower Adrian sensed in him. As far as demons went, he was merely a nuisance to a being of Adrian\u2019s age and power, but the rapaciousness with which he regarded Lindsay and the disrespect he showed her was intolerable.</p><p>\u201cIf you apologize to the lady for your rudeness,\u201d Adrian said softly, \u201cI might refrain from eviscerating you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d The dragon held up both hands, his eyes darting. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, lady. Just tell her to stand down, seraph, and I\u2019ll walk out of here.\u201d</p><p>The demon\u2019s mortal guise was that of a sandy-haired, ponytailed teenager with baggy clothing and a name badge that read SAM, but there was a reptilian coldness to his gaze that betrayed a far darker interior. Dragons were a nasty class of demon, prone to terrorizing mortals for sport before making a snack of them. But this guy was Raguel\u2019s problem; Adrian had bigger game to hunt.</p><p>Adrian flicked his wrist dismissively, already bored with the delay. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think not,\u201d Lindsay growled.</p><p>A streak of silver raced past Adrian\u2019s eyes. His gaze followed with equal speed.</p><p>For an instant, the dragon swayed with a throwing dagger protruding from his forehead and his mouth agape in a frozen look of disbelief. Then his body disintegrated into embers, falling into a pile of ash half the height of the man. The suddenly anchorless blade cut through the debris and clattered to the floor amid a stunned silence.</p><p>Adrian crouched and picked up the small knife, which shouldn\u2019t have been able to wipe out a dragon; the breed had an impenetrable hide. If \u201cSam\u201d had suspected for even an instant that he was under attack, he would have shifted to protect himself. But Lindsay had blindsided him as well as Adrian.</p><p>A hot surge of desire rocked Adrian back on his heels, followed swiftly by the fury of a man who\u2019d just watched his reason for breathing put herself in incalculable danger. He stood and looked at her.</p><p>She returned his gaze with a tight smile. \u201cLooks like we both have some explaining to do.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>\u201cAre you planning on using that?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay fingered one of the throwing knives she carried in her messenger bag and made no apologies. When they\u2019d deplaned at John Wayne Airport, she\u2019d met Adrian\u2019s guards and had realized they weren\u2019t human. They also weren\u2019t inhuman or evil, because she would have felt it if they were\u2014just as the clerk at the grocery store had caught her eye like a neon sign. To be safe, she\u2019d grabbed her arsenal sack the moment her suitcase appeared on the luggage carousel.</p><p>She shrugged, deliberately affecting a nonchalance that mirrored his. \u201cIt calms me to have it in hand.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been slaying malevolent nonhuman . . . beings since she was sixteen and had long since stopped losing sleep over it. What was eating at her now was Adrian. That heinous thing in the grocery store had known him\u2014had deferred to him\u2014had shown fear when Adrian threatened him. While she, batshit crazy as she was, found herself feeling safer around Adrian than she had at any time since she was five years old.</p><p>God . . . She knew how to look away, how to wait for prime opportunities. She knew where Sam worked; she could have gone back at a better time and taken him down in privacy. Instead, she had exposed herself as completely as if she\u2019d ripped off her clothes.</p><p>She had done it because she couldn\u2019t not do it. She\u2019d been too young to save her mother, but in the years since, she had sworn she would never stand by and watch another innocent die. The look in Sam\u2019s eyes as he backed up was one she knew: he was spoiling for trouble. No way in hell could she let him leave in that frame of mind. She\u2019d never stop wondering who ended up bearing the brunt of his humiliation and frustration, and whether she could have prevented the consequences.</p><p>\u201cIt calms you to carry a weapon,\u201d Adrian repeated, studying her from his seat beside her. His sleek black Maybach purred up the side of a hill, following a winding road that left the city behind.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Her heart was beating too fast, forcing her to acknowledge how wound up she was. With rigid focus, she made her brain stop spinning around what she didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t slide back toward that dark precipice in her mind, that place where insanity whispered along her subconscious like a lover. Her childhood therapist considered her one of his greatest successes. He thought she was remarkably well adjusted for a woman who\u2019d witnessed the brutal murder of her mother at the tender age of five. He didn\u2019t know that when the foundation of her reality had been torn from her, she\u2019d forged a new one. An existence where creatures with inexplicable powers worked in grocery stores and ripped open the throats of parents in front of their children. She\u2019d become a warrior in that world of black and white, that world of humans and vicious inhumans.</p><p>Yet Adrian and his bullet catchers made a lie of what she\u2019d come to accept as the truth. What was he? What was she? Where did she fit in a construct where beings who weren\u2019t inhuman also weren\u2019t evil?</p><p>Lindsay swallowed past the lump of uncertainty and confusion clogging her throat.</p><p>Adrian\u2019s lips pursed so slightly the action was almost imperceptible. The hot, pulsing energy charging the air around him was totally at odds with his insolently apathetic demeanor. He sprawled elegantly in the bucket seat, sleekly graceful and inherently lethal. When Adrian had issued that softly voiced threat to Sam, she hadn\u2019t blamed the whatever-the-fuck-he-was for looking like he was going to piss himself. While there hadn\u2019t been even the tiniest fissure in Adrian\u2019s composure, he had felt like a tornado to her, a violent and sweeping unstoppable force of destruction.</p><p>If death had a face, it was Adrian\u2019s when he was pissed: a terror made more horrifying by its impossible beauty.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I am,\u201d he said, the unique resonance of his voice even more pronounced, \u201cbut you knew what the store clerk was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only time I like showing my hand first is when there\u2019s a knife flying out of it.\u201d</p><p>He moved so swiftly. One instant, he was arm\u2019s distance away; the next, he\u2019d immobilized her. Her hand holding the knife was pinned at the wrist to the leather seat, while the other was locked to the seatback in an iron grip. His blue eyes were aflame, literally glowing in the darkness.</p><p>Her heart raced in awe and mad fear. She had no idea what he was, but she knew he could break her far too easily. Power radiated from him like a heat wave, flushing her skin and stinging her eyes. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s gaze was hot with rage and sex. \u201cYou\u2019ll find me to be amazingly lenient with you, Lindsay. I\u2019ll concede and bend for you in ways I won\u2019t for anyone else. But when it comes to your safety, there can be no games or evasion. You just took out a dragon who didn\u2019t attack you first. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dragon?\u201d Shock stuttered her breathing. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t even know what he was before you killed him?\u201d</p><p>Realizing he was serious, Lindsay deflated into the seatback, all fight and resistance leaving her in a rush. \u201cI knew he was evil. And not human.\u201d</p><p>Just as she knew Adrian wasn\u2019t, either. Not human but not vile. Capable of being terrifying, yet he didn\u2019t incite the chilling and paralyzing fear that had afflicted her when her mother was killed. Lindsay searched for it, waited for it to rise and choke her with sick dread. But the anxiety never came. The tempest she sensed in him lacked violence, but even that\u2014his effect on her inner radar\u2014was unique. She read him as she would the weather, as if he was one with the wind that had spoken to her for as long as she could remember. There was a familiarity about him that she couldn\u2019t explain or deny. And though he subdued her, he did so with an unbreakable but gentle grip, the look on his face filled with longing and torment . . . Everything about the way he dealt with her humanized him.</p><p>Whatever he was, she saw him as a man. Not a monster.</p><p>Adrian stared at her, his jaw taut. Above them, the panoramic glass roof afforded a backdrop of black sky and stars. The moment lengthened into two, then three, with neither of them capable of looking away. Finally, he whispered in a language she didn\u2019t recognize, his voice throbbing with an emotion that elicited a quiver of warm surprise. His head bowed. His temple touched hers, nuzzling. His lips brushed against her ear, his hair drifting like thick silk against her brow. His scent\u2014the earthy, wild fragrance of the air after a storm\u2014enveloped her. Her lips parted on gasping breaths and she sought his mouth blindly, overcome by an inexplicable hunger for the taste of him.</p><p>He shoved back, reclaiming his seat. His head was turned away from her as he asked in too calm a tone, \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay sat unmoving, devastated by that moment of tenderness and yearning so fleeting she wondered if she\u2019d imagined it. She struggled to pull herself together, swallowing hard to find her voice. \u201cI can feel it. I know you\u2019re not human, either.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you intend to kill me, too?\u201d</p><p>His menacing purr set her teeth on edge. She straightened. \u201cIf I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore info.\u201d She deliberately flipped her small blade up and down through her fingers, trying to regain her center of balance by engaging in a familiar activity. She wasn\u2019t going to tell him about the wind and the way it spoke to her. For all she knew, it could be a major weakness he\u2019d know how to exploit. \u201cYou\u2019re . . . different. Not like the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, exactly, constitutes an \u2018other\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes. Sharp teeth, claws, bloodsuckers. Evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been killing vampires?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTen years.\u201d</p><p>A long stretch of silence. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough questions,\u201d she shot back. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear your heart racing,\u201d he taunted softly. \u201cYou\u2019re smart to be wary. You don\u2019t know what I am or what I can do. And you\u2019ve lost the element of surprise. Now I know what you\u2019re capable of.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay smiled without humor, rising to the challenge. He was in a volatile mood, and it whipped against her senses like the lash of tropical rain. \u201cYou have no idea what I\u2019m capable of. You haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d Leaning toward him, she repeated, \u201cWhat. Are. You?\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention ahead. \u201cWhen we get to the house, I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p> <p>Lindsay stared at him and played loosely with her knife. He\u2019d gotten the drop on her moments earlier, taking her completely unawares, and even that wasn\u2019t enough to put her on full alert. He disarmed her in every way, despite knowing how dangerous he was.</p><p>Whatever else she discovered about Adrian Mitchell, it was irrefutable that he beguiled. And that was more hazardous to her than any claws, fangs, or scales he might reveal. A damned sight scarier, too.</p><p>She focused on his magnificent profile. Even after receiving the entirety of his attention for the last few hours, she was still arrested by the strength of his jawline and the aristocratic line of his nose. And she loved the shape of his lips, which were so beautifully etched they were a work of art in their own right . . .</p><p>Mental images of that seductive mouth brushing across her skin, whispering heated, erotic words and curving in full smiles seized her heart in a fist. In her mind\u2019s eye there was an entire repertoire of intimate, shadowy images that were so moving they were almost like memories. Arousal swept over her skin, tightening her nipples and spurring a slow, hot trickle between her legs.</p><p>Tearing her gaze away, she looked out the window and fought to regulate her erratic breathing. Fuck. What was wrong with her? She was a mess. A quivering, pissed off, turned on, jittery mess.</p><p>The distance between the sprawling hillside properties was widening the higher they climbed. Soon the infrequent streetlights disappeared, the evening sky swallowing them whole except for the narrow swathe of the headlights. She reminded herself that Adrian was a known personage and her father knew where she was, but those safeguards didn\u2019t calm the part of her mind screaming, He\u2019s not human.</p><p>The car slowed when they reached a wrought-iron gate bisecting the road, cutting off further public access. She surveyed their immediate surroundings, her gaze pausing on a rough-edged granite slab on the shoulder that was sandblasted with the words ANGELS\u2019 POINT. A frisson of unease slid down Lindsay\u2019s spine.</p><p>A burly guard stepped out of a gatehouse. He looked at Adrian\u2019s driver\u2014Elijah\u2014and nodded, then retreated back inside to open the gate. The Maybach drove another half mile or so before the house came into view. As dark as the night was this high above the light pollution of the city, Lindsay had no trouble seeing the home. It was drenched in floodlights to the extent that the evening was lit like daylight. It would be impossible for anyone to approach the house from any side or from above without being seen.</p> <p>The residence scaled the side of the cliff in three tiers, each with its own wide wraparound deck. Distressed wood siding, rock terraces, and exposed wooden beams made the house seem almost as if it was part of the hillside. She knew nothing about architecture, but Angels\u2019 Point screamed affluence\u2014as everything about Adrian did.</p><p>The car rolled to a stop, and her door was opened by yet another guard. Lindsay was about to step out when Adrian appeared before her with his hand extended. She couldn\u2019t help but notice his speed, which he apparently felt he no longer needed to hide, but she made no comment. She appreciated him dropping the pretense of being human, but she wasn\u2019t going to praise him for it.</p><p>Her feet crunched atop the gravel driveway. She was attempting to absorb the grandeur of the house when movement in the periphery of her vision turned her head. A huge wolf prowled by.</p><p>Gasping in surprise and instinctive trepidation, Lindsay flattened herself against the side of the car. Adrian caught her by the elbows, the shield of his body filling her with indefinable comfort and relief. The beast sniffed a tire, then lifted its majestic head and studied her with undeniable intelligence. Her startled senses kicked into overdrive, prepping her body for defending herself.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need that,\u201d Adrian murmured, making her realize the readiness with which she held her knife.</p><p>Elijah rounded the hood of the car. A low growl rumbled from his chest as he stared at the wolf. The beast stepped back, lowering its gaze.</p><p>More wolves appeared. An entire pack, or perhaps two. Lindsay didn\u2019t know how many wolves made up a pack, but there were at least a dozen of the multicolored beasts padding around the driveway. Their size was imposing. Each one looked as if it ate an entire cow every day.</p><p>Lightning streaked across the sky, perfectly mimicking the electrical charge around Adrian.</p><p>Jesus. She exhaled in a rush.</p><p>The otherworldliness of both the place and the man beside her made her shiver. The wind caressed her, ruffling her hair but carrying neither a warning nor reassurance. She was on her own and feeling like she\u2019d fallen down the rabbit hole\u2014confused, fascinated, stoned.</p><p>Adrian gestured toward the house. \u201cCome inside.\u201d</p><p>She followed his lead. They entered through a double-door entrance, crossing over a slate foyer to reach a massive sunken living room. An enormous fireplace dominated one wall; Lindsay was fairly certain her Prius would easily fit inside it.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked, releasing her and watching her carefully, as if her opinion mattered.</p><p>The interior of Adrian\u2019s home was a thoroughly masculine space, decorated in shades of brown and taupe, with splashes of a burnt red that reminded her of rust. Renewable green materials had been liberally used\u2014carved woods, thick cotton linens, dried grasses. Directly opposite the front door was a wall of windows overlooking the smaller hills and valleys below. In the distance, city lights twinkled with multihued fire, but the metropolis seemed worlds away from this transcendent place. To call the residence amazing would be an understatement. It suited Adrian so well. For all his urbanity, she sensed an earthy connection to nature in him.</p><p>She kept her bag close to her side and faced him. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He gave a regal nod. \u201cYou\u2019ll be staying here indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>His imperiousness was stunning. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to keep you where I know you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p><p>I need to keep you . . . As if he had the right. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to be kept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have considered that before you killed a dragon in a public place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who gave me away. Or your bodyguards did. If I hadn\u2019t been with you, he never would have paid any attention to me. So if I\u2019m a target, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of who\u2019s to blame,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cElijah noticed you were being followed. There was a brief span of time while you were in the restroom when Sam\u2019s whereabouts are unaccounted for. It\u2019s possible he notified someone that he saw you with us. If he did, his disappearance will raise suspicions and we\u2019ll be the first place to start looking for him.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy would a chick hanging out with you interest him or anyone else? You\u2019re rich and hot as hell. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re seen with women all the time. Are you talking about him calling the paparazzi? Or more dragon dudes?\u201d</p><p>Adrian gestured down the hallway with a graceful extension of his arm. \u201cLet me show you to your room. You can freshen up; then we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll talk,\u201d Lindsay corrected. \u201cI\u2019ll listen.\u201d</p><p>His hand came to rest at the small of her back and she felt the power thrumming through him\u2014tremendous energy restrained by a cyclonic force of will that awed her.</p><p>He was something different in this place. The power she\u2019d felt in him from the beginning was sharper, more refined. Or perhaps it was just more apparent. Perhaps he made it so deliberately. Either way, the agitation he\u2019d exuded in the Maybach was tightly leashed now. Why would he betray that disquiet to her, a stranger, but restrain it in his own home, where he should feel the most comfortable?</p><p>She looked around and realized they weren\u2019t alone. There were others with them: more muscular guys as well as some who were elegantly built like Adrian. A few women, too\u2014all were stunning enough to rouse feelings of jealousy and possessiveness. All together, there were a dozen spectators hanging around the fringes of the room, sizing her up with examining and somewhat hostile glances.</p><p>She pushed her hand into her messenger bag and wrapped her fist around the hilt of a second blade. She was outnumbered by a huge margin and, as a human, definitely underpowered. Her pulse raced with foreboding.</p><p>\u201cLindsay\u2014\u201d Adrian\u2019s hand encircled her other wrist and instantly her heartbeat slowed, calm radiating outward from the place where he touched her. \u201cYou don\u2019t need those. This is the safest place on earth for you. No one will harm you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would make it as difficult as possible,\u201d she promised, speaking to the room at large. A possibly empty threat, considering she had no idea what the hell she was dealing with.</p><p>\u201cBe careful. You\u2019re mortal. Fragile.\u201d</p><p>She shot him an arch glance. She could hold her own against any other \u201cmortals,\u201d even men triple her size. For Adrian to call her \u201cfragile\u201d reaffirmed her belief that, whatever he was, he was powerful in a way she hadn\u2019t known existed. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t established what you are.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, relenting. \u201cYou spoke of vampires. What other creatures do you know of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDragons. Thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>He released her and stepped back. \u201cIf there were angels, would they be the good guys or the bad?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s mind spun. Angels had a biblical connotation, and she\u2019d turned her back on religion long ago. She\u2019d had to. She got too pissed off thinking about anyone having the ability to prevent her mother\u2019s death, yet doing nothing.</p><p>She forced her tense shoulders to relax. \u201cDepends on whether or not they were actively killing the vampires and dragons.\u201d</p><p>Sleek tendrils of smoke drifted up from behind him. The mist spread outward, taking on the shape and substance of wings\u2014pure, pristinely white wings touched with crimson tips, as if he\u2019d trailed the edges through freshly spilled blood.</p><p>Lindsay stumbled backward, barely catching herself with a hand against the wall. The purity of his true form threatened to blind her. Power emanated from him with a warm radiance that was tangible; she felt as if she was basking in the noonday sun.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes and her knees weakened. The hallway spun with a terrible sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, millisecond flashes of Adrian with wings. Different clothes . . . altered hair length . . . various backdrops . . .</p><p>For a moment, she feared she would pass out. And then it all coalesced into one thought: an angel.</p><p>Shit. She was so far removed from piety, the concept existed in a totally different universe. Even now\u2014presented with his wings and glorious golden glow\u2014what she felt was less about reverence and more about primitive, sinful lust. If anything, she\u2019d grown more enamored with Adrian as his wings unfurled, because seeing him without his facade exposed him as openly as she\u2019d exposed herself in the store.</p><p>She\u2019d been peculiar all her life. Faster, stronger, capable of sensing minute changes in the wind that told her when something wrong was nearby. As a child, she\u2019d often felt like a mutant, always having to be conscious of how quickly she moved. The last decade had been spent trying to be \u201cnormal\u201d while hunting dangerous things to kill. She\u2019d given up hope of having a serious romantic relationship. The need to hide an integral part of herself had left her utterly alone in the most fundamental of ways.</p><p>Now she faced someone who knew she was different. Someone who just might accept her being that way because he was different, too. She\u2019d been unable to confide in anyone about the underworld she knew existed. But Adrian knew . . .</p><p>\u201cYou were going to let that dragon walk away!\u201d she accused, shielding her sudden vulnerability behind anger. Just by knowing that she hunted, Adrian knew her\u2014in a deeply intimate way that no one else did. He was suddenly precious to her for that reason, this ethereal being of impossible beauty.</p><p>\u201cYour safety was my primary concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself. You should have taken care of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only hunt vampires,\u201d he said smoothly. \u201cAnd as I said, he was a dragon.\u201d</p><p>The front door opened and her gaze flew to it. Elijah walked in, carrying the groceries. He paused on the threshold, his handsome face impassive as he took in the tense scene before him. A lock of his thick brown hair slashed across his brow, framing eyes like emeralds. Although she hadn\u2019t seen him smile even once, she didn\u2019t get an unfriendly vibe from him. He just seemed watchful and sharply curious. Definitely smart. He was canny, she bet, and hard to catch unawares. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt Adrian come up beside her. The scent of his skin teased her with her next inhalation. He\u2019s an angel. And he hunts vampires . . .</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re hungry,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLet\u2019s get you settled, so you can come talk to me while I make dinner.\u201d</p><p>The thought of a celestial winged being slaving over a hot stove for her was bizarre, yet there was an eerie sense of rightness in being with Adrian this way, as if the intimacy of him preparing a meal for her was recognizable.</p><p>God, she had to get a grip. She had to figure out the new rules and how to either deal with them or circumvent them. She couldn\u2019t afford to be ignorant, and she certainly wouldn\u2019t have anyone dictating where she would stay and when she could go. Somewhere out there, the vampires who\u2019d killed her mother were certainly terrorizing someone else. They\u2019d taken such pleasure from the pain and fear they had wrought; she couldn\u2019t see them quitting until someone put them down. She wanted to be the one to do it, and she wasn\u2019t going to stop hunting until she knew for sure they would never destroy another child\u2019s innocence the way they had hers.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut, like I said, you\u2019re the one doing the talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Elijah leaned his forearm against a top bunk in the lycan barracks and looked at the men and women gathered around him. \u201cI don\u2019t see how Adrian knows. She just showed up in the airport and he\u2019s been all over her ever since. I\u2019ve never seen him glance twice at a woman, but he can\u2019t take his eyes off her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s just his type,\u201d Jonas said, showing the limits of his sixteen years with his na\u00efvet\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cSeraphim don\u2019t have a type. They don\u2019t have emotions like we do. They don\u2019t lust or hunger or crave.\u201d At least that\u2019s what Elijah had been taught as a pup, and what he\u2019d observed with his own eyes. But tonight, during the ride home from the grocery store, he\u2019d felt a raw energy radiating from Adrian that betrayed an emotional response to the threat Lindsay Gibson had faced in the dragon. And there was a sharp, intensely possessive edge to the way Adrian managed her. He acted as if she meant something to him, while she clearly had never met him before in her life.</p> <p>\u201cStill, she\u2019s hot.\u201d Jonas shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d do her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even joke about that,\u201d Elijah snapped. \u201cHe\u2019d shred you. He was ready to take down a demon, in public, just for looking at her wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would\u2019ve ticked off Raguel,\u201d Micah pointed out, rubbing his hand over his jaw thoughtfully. \u201cYou know how pissy the archangels get over their territory, especially with the seraphim. Not to mention the possibility of irritating the demon\u2019s liege. Adrian would have stirred up a lot of trouble for a woman he supposedly just met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy her? She\u2019s human.\u201d Esther\u2019s tone was scathing, inciting the other females to nod.</p><p>\u201cShe slew a dragon like she was swatting a fly.\u201d Elijah met the multitude of verdant gazes aimed at him. \u201cShe moved faster than I\u2019ve ever seen a mortal move, but you\u2019re right, Esther. She\u2019s human. I can\u2019t smell anything else in her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there has to be,\u201d Micah guessed, catching on to what was left unsaid.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elijah agreed. \u201cI overheard her tell Adrian she can sense demons and vampires, and she\u2019s been hunting them for ten years.\u201d</p><p>A rumble of disbelief moved through the pack.</p><p>His mouth curved wryly. \u201cAdrian was showing her his wings when I walked into the house. There\u2019s a story there. It would be good to know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Jonas asked, looking to Elijah for the answer, as all the lycans in the room did.</p><p>The others turned to him too often. It was a burden Elijah didn\u2019t want, one he couldn\u2019t afford to bear. Everyone seemed to forget that he\u2019d been transferred to Adrian\u2019s pack for observation. He told himself they were simply used to him being bullheaded. He just needed to break them of the habit of letting him do things his way all the time. But even that implied a power he shouldn\u2019t be capable of wielding.</p><p>\u201cKeep your heads down,\u201d he answered finally. \u201cKeep your noses clean. Jason made the suggestion that Phineas\u2019s death might have been lycan related. We don\u2019t want to give them any excuse to keep thinking that way.\u201d</p><p>Esther snorted. \u201cJason\u2019s never trusted us\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s second-in-command now,\u201d Elijah reminded. \u201cHis opinion matters.\u201d</p> <p>He looked down the length of the long, narrow room. It was a utilitarian space, filled with rows of olive green metal bunk beds and matching footlockers. Of all the packs, Adrian\u2019s was the least comfortable. Most of the others were in the remote areas where the Sentinels kept the vampires contained, locations where a lycan could run and hunt and pretend to be free. But Adrian\u2019s pack was considered the most prestigious. The Sentinel captain paid and fed his lycans well, but, more important, he hunted only the most egregious offenders, the most vicious, cunning, and dangerous vampires. And any lycan worth a shit hungered for worthy, challenging prey.</p><p>Elijah rolled his shoulders back. \u201cMy advice: listen carefully to everything said around you. Nothing is too unimportant to take note of. And, please, think twice before you do anything that attracts attention to you.\u201d</p><p>Growling their assent, the group dispersed before they were discovered. Collusion and mutiny were serious charges none of them wanted to face.</p><p>Micah stayed behind, running a hand through the striking red hair that carried over to his wolf pelt. Before speaking, he glanced over each of his powerful shoulders to search for eavesdroppers. Then, he leaned in and whispered, \u201cShe could be our ticket to freedom.\u201d</p><p>Elijah stiffened. \u201cDon\u2019t say another word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to say it! We shouldn\u2019t have to live like this\u2014fighting against our very natures and repressing our instincts. I saw you carrying Adrian\u2019s fucking groceries . You\u2019re better than that. Better than him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Elijah turned away. There was nothing he could do. An uprising would lead only to the deaths of everyone he cared about. \u201cHe saved my life today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d take it just as easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But right now I\u2019m indebted to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t not try, and we can\u2019t succeed without you. I know you see what an opportunity this woman is. If Adrian is attached to her, who knows what he might give up to see her returned to him safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t give up his control over lycans!\u201d Elijah sank heavily onto a bottom bunk. \u201cIf you think our protection has made the Sentinels weak, you\u2019re delusional. They\u2019re seraphim trained to overpower other seraphim, the most powerful celestial beings aside from the Creator. Adrian lives and breathes his mission. The Sentinels train every day as if Armageddon is tomorrow. They would slaughter us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to die as lycans than to cower as dogs.\u201d</p><p>Elijah knew Micah wasn\u2019t the only lycan feeling reckless. Many believed the power struggle between the angels and vampires was no longer a lycan problem, and that a revolution was in order to secure the freedom they felt was their due. Elijah didn\u2019t disagree, but he also didn\u2019t have a mate or pups to fight for. He had only himself, and hunting vampires was what he lived for. Working for Adrian gave him the intel and resources to do what he did best.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not cowering,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re responsible for containing former seraphim. That\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s servitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would we do with ourselves if we didn\u2019t have that? Where would we go? You gonna take a desk job? Have a commute? Have human toddlers over to your house for playdates with your pups?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I\u2019d be free. I could do anything I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be hunted. Every day we\u2019d be looking over our shoulders, waiting for Adrian to walk in the door and put us down. Running isn\u2019t freedom.\u201d</p><p>The redhead sat on the bed opposite him. \u201cYou\u2019ve thought about this\u2014a lot, it sounds like. Unfortunately, I have to pack\u2014I\u2019m heading back to Louisiana on a hunt\u2014but we\u2019ll talk more when I\u2019m home again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about. Escape would be futile. Stop pushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your Beta, El.\u201d Micah grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a Beta. I don\u2019t have a pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that. Still won\u2019t make it true. You control your beast, and somehow, that makes it strong enough to dominate the rest of us. I know you feel it, too, the way every lycan instinctively looks to you. We can\u2019t help it. That makes you boss whether you like it or not. We can stir shit up on our own, but when it comes down to it, we need a leader, and you\u2019re the only one who exerts the force necessary to become one.\u201d</p><p>Elijah stood. His uniqueness might be their one saving grace. If they couldn\u2019t band together cohesively without him, that might just save their lives. He knew what was said about him: his ability to rein his beast in at all times was an anomaly among lycans. Fear, anger, pain\u2014they could all trigger an unwanted shift, but he never altered unless he chose to. As far as he was concerned, that might make him a mutant, but it didn\u2019t make him an Alpha. It sure as hell didn\u2019t make it acceptable to lead his kind to slaughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to lead a charge into a bloodbath,\u201d he said, \u201cknowing it\u2019s pointless. Not gonna happen. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late to avoid, El. Centuries too late.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>As Lindsay licked a crumb from her lower lip, the thoughts sweeping through Adrian\u2019s mind were unrepentantly sexual. She was a beautiful woman\u2014a tigress with her golden hair and dark, watchful eyes\u2014but what roused him at that moment was the gusto with which she ate. She alternated between using chopsticks with skill and eating with her fingers, her enjoyment evident in her soft hums of appreciation and hearty appetite.</p><p>\u201cThis is really good,\u201d she praised.</p><p>Her fervency made him smile inwardly.</p><p>Sentinels were created to be too neutral to relish anything with such passion. The highs and lows of human emotion weren\u2019t meant for them. They were the weights that balanced the scales, the sword that leveled the field.</p><p>She held a shrimp up by the tail. \u201cMy dad took my grandma out to a teppanyaki restaurant for dinner once. She totally dug the flames and flying spatulas until the chef did this fancy maneuver that ended with a shrimp flicked onto her plate. I thought it was awesome. The guy had mad skills But my granny just stared at the shrimp for a long minute\u2014the stare of death, I\u2019m telling you\u2014then she tossed it back. She was so insulted. To her mind, the chef should have learned some manners before working in a nice establishment.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s brows rose.</p><p>Lindsay rocked back on the bar stool, laughing. \u201cYou should have seen the guy\u2019s face. My dad bought him a couple shots of sake just to soothe his pride.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter was infectious. The sound was so open and free he couldn\u2019t fight a smile any longer. His mouth curved for the first time in centuries. He liked her. He wanted to get to know her better.</p><p>But he had to maintain the appearance of a calm, unaffected host. Both for her sake and for the benefit of his Sentinels. He could feel their wariness and distrust. Although they would never voice the accusation, they knew Shadoe weakened him. Their concern for his well-being could foster a dangerous resentment if he wasn\u2019t cautious. His unit was comprised of seraphim who were better than him, angels who didn\u2019t suffer the same emotional frailties he did. They didn\u2019t fully understand what a vulnerability Shadoe was to him, because they couldn\u2019t grasp the mortal love he felt. If a Sentinel came to believe their mission had been overly compromised by Lindsay, they\u2019d kill her and be justified in doing so.</p><p>Focusing on deep-frying the vegetable tempura,Adrian resisted glancing at Lindsay too often. She sat on a stool on the opposite side of his granite-topped kitchen island, nursing her third glass of water. He found himself aroused by the way she swallowed. Two hundred years of celibacy had taken their toll. During Shadoe\u2019s dormancy, he craved no woman\u2019s touch. But when her soul returned, his repressed need and hunger surged to the fore, all the more voracious for having been contained for so long. He was aching to taste her, push inside her, make her writhe beneath relentless thrusts of his cock.</p><p>But that would have to wait. Lindsay needed to trust him first, then want him as much as he wanted her. When he finally had her, there would be no restraint. And he didn\u2019t expect she would allow him any. Not as fierce as she was. When she gave herself, it would be with abandon, he suspected. This woman with the heart of a warrior and a soul radiating such pain.</p><p>He would simply have to be patient through the necessary prerequisite steps: keep her safe, make her strong, win her trust.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating,\u201d she noted.</p><p>\u201cI am, actually. Just not in the same manner as you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Her tone was deceptively neutral. \u201cWhat\u2019s your way?\u201d</p><p>Her grip on her lacquered chopsticks changed, became lethal. He could snap her spine with the slightest touch, yet her sense of right and wrong coupled with her need to protect others goaded her to prepare for an offensive move in a no-win scenario. He admired that fighting spirit and strength of conviction.</p><p>Adrian considered his answer carefully. It would do him no favors to have her see him as a parasite like the vampires. \u201cI absorb energy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s energy all around us\u2014in the air, the water, the earth. The same energy harnessed by wind turbines and hydroelectric plants like the Hoover Dam.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBet that comes in handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s convenient,\u201d he agreed, returning his attention to cooking the last of the batter-coated shrimp and vegetables.</p><p>His energy levels were thrumming now, as they always did when Shadoe was near. Her proximity\u2014the unique force of two souls in one vessel\u2014allowed him to achieve the greatest levels of power of which he was capable. Life-force energy from souls was the primary source of seraphim sustenance and the reason why the Fallen had turned to blood drinking\u2014they still needed life-force energy to survive, but the stripping away of their souls forced them to obtain that energy through direct means.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lindsay began, \u201cyou hunt vampires.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the guy in the grocery store, he was a dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cAre there also demons? I mean, angels and demons always seem to go hand in hand.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the last of the tempura out of the oil with a strainer, then turned the burner off. \u201cThe dragon was a demon. There are other classifications of beings that fall under that designation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some creatures who have fangs and drink blood that are demons. But they\u2019re not my problem. My responsibility is other angels\u2014fallen angels. The vampires I hunt were once like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you. Angels. Really.\u201d Her lips thinned. \u201cBut aren\u2019t demons everyone\u2019s concern? They\u2019re the bad guys, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mission is sharply defined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a soldier, Lindsay. I have duties and orders, and I follow them. I expect those whose job it is to hunt demons feel the same way about their responsibilities. It\u2019s not my place to intercede and I wouldn\u2019t regardless. Frankly, I have enough on my plate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut someone is taking care of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a moment, then nodded slowly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. If someone\u2019s vibe is off, I\u2019ve taken them out.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s grip on the counter tightened. It was a miracle she was alive today. \u201cHow do you sense this vibe? How does it feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m walking through a Halloween fun house and I know something is about to jump out at me. My stomach quivers and the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. But it\u2019s really intense. There\u2019s no mistaking it for anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds scary. Yet you hunt the things that scare you. Why?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay set her chin atop steepled fingers. \u201cI don\u2019t have aspirations of saving the world, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. I hate killing. But I can feel the evil in these things for a reason. I can\u2019t turn my back on that. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel you have a calling.\u201d</p> <p>She took a slow, deep inhalation. The silence stretched out. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows that you hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your guards, and whoever you tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. This is a no-brainer, but I have to say it anyway: you\u2019re going to have to trust me,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI have no chance of helping you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you intend to do? Help me?\u201d Her shoulders went back. \u201cDid you know about me when you saw me in the airport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I know you could sense demons and vamps, and were actively hunting them?\u201d he clarified, deliberately narrowing the scope of her query so he could answer honestly. \u201cNo. I saw you, I wanted you, and you made it clear there was a possibility I could have you. I acted on that.\u201d</p><p>Lines bracketed her mouth and eyes. A muscle in her jaw twitched with tension. \u201cAnd that sort of coincidence just rolls right off your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happened to be in the same place you were at the right time. After that, we met because you sensed I was \u2018different,\u2019 right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I thought you were the hottest man I\u2019d ever seen. The vibe came later. As for right place/right time, I should have been on an earlier flight. I missed my connection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was attacked by a vampire this morning, which resulted in the crash of my helicopter and a need to travel commercial. See?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cRandom chaos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel. Aren\u2019t you supposed to preach about a divine plan or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom of choice, Lindsay. We all have it. Today you and I were affected by the ramifications of other people\u2019s choices.\u201d He held her gaze. \u201cBut you don\u2019t really want to get into a theological discussion with me. You want to avoid talking about the events that led you to hunt. I\u2019m not going to push you\u2014yet\u2014but we\u2019re at an impasse until I know what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d</p><p>She stared back. \u201cYou\u2019re so sure I have a story to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you in action. It takes years of practice to learn how to wield a blade like that. Who taught you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI taught myself.\u201d</p><p>Fierce admiration heated his blood. \u201cWhat materials are you using to forge your blades? You must use at least trace amounts of silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I figured out most . . . things have a negative reaction to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDragons don\u2019t. In fact, aside from two points of weakness, they have an impenetrable hide. Your blade would\u2019ve bounced right off of him if he\u2019d shifted.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay held up her left hand and showed the pad of her thumb. A straight crimson line betrayed a recent injury. \u201cSome creatures have a negative reaction to my blood, too. I always smear a little on my blades before I toss them, just in case. The blood by itself won\u2019t kill, but it gives my weapons a chance to get the job done. Found that out the hard way.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s mind spun with the implications. She was mortal, but even if she\u2019d been a naphil like Shadoe, her blood shouldn\u2019t have any effect on others.</p><p>She continued to eat, blissfully unaware of his confusion.</p><p>Reining in his thoughts, he said, \u201cSo you dedicated what had to be a substantial portion of your free time to learning how to kill things that frighten you. You have a strong sense of right and wrong, Lindsay, but no one who\u2019s sane begins killing things without provocation. No matter how evil you sense someone may be, you had to have witnessed that evil firsthand to resort to lethal force. Something tipped you off, and something else keeps you motivated. Vengeance, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to help me get it?\u201d Her expression was wary and assessing. \u201cHow would you do that, exactly ? Why would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Our goals are the same. You\u2019ve been lucky so far, but that won\u2019t last. One day soon you\u2019re going to take down a demon or vamp who has friends who\u2019ll hunt you, or you\u2019ll miss your target. Either way, your days are numbered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you teach me the difference between vampires and demons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you have a preference.\u201d He crossed his arms. \u201cI can point you in the right direction and give you backup. I can train you how to hunt more effectively and show you how to kill without relying on surprise. Right now you\u2019re floating aimlessly, waiting for random encounters. I can give you focus and specific targets.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay leaned back in her chair. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>Her proclivities, while deeply troubling, provided him with an ideal excuse to keep her close. \u201cI\u2019m holding the front line in a battle in which I\u2019m outnumbered. I can use every soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t all I do. I have a regular life and a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I. We can work out the logistics together.\u201d</p><p>She caught her lower lip between her teeth. After an interminable moment, she nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. He enjoyed a moment of sharp satisfaction. Then he heard the front door opening. A moment later, Damien stepped into view.</p><p>Adrian\u2019s focus shifted to the expected report on Phineas\u2019s death. \u201cJoin us.\u201d</p><p>The Sentinel entered the kitchen. He glanced briefly at Lindsay, then turned his attention to Adrian. \u201cCaptain.\u201d</p><p>Introducing them, Adrian made a point of identifying Lindsay as a recruit.</p><p>Damien\u2019s seraph blue eyes returned to her. \u201cMs. Gibson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Lindsay, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak freely,\u201d Adrian prompted Damien, giving the Sentinel a look that told him to hold his questions about Lindsay\u2019s incarnation of Shadoe until later.</p><p>There was a moment of hesitation; then Damien began relaying the details. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a lot of usable information out of Phineas\u2019s surviving lycan. The beast was incoherent with grief. He did say that the vampire who attacked them was sick. I\u2019m not sure if he meant physically ill or mentally twisted. The attack was especially brutal, so it could very well be the latter. Phineas\u2019s neck was gnawed down to his spinal cord.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay cleared her throat. \u201cLycans? As in werewolves?\u201d</p><p>Adrian glanced at her. \u201cWerewolves are demons. Lycans share a bloodline with them, which allows them to shape-shift in a similar manner. But unlike weres, they were once angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as a heads-up,\u201d Damien added grimly, \u201cthey get very offended if anyone calls them werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngels.\u201d Lindsay\u2019s eyes were wide and dark, the irises a mere sliver of brown around dilated pupils. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they become vampires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I needed reinforcement,\u201d Adrian said. \u201cWe came to an agreement\u2014I would petition the Creator to spare them from vampirism if they agreed to help me keep the vampires in line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they part of the same group of angels, the vampires and the lycans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her only sign of disquiet was the way she twisted her glass of water back and forth on the countertop. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your . . . Phineas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy second-in-command. My friend\u2014no, more than a friend. He was like a brother to me.\u201d Adrian had retracted his wings during dinner, but they unfurled again, flexing with his inner agitation and thirst for battle.</p><p>Her gaze followed the upper curve of one wing, softening. He felt that tender look as if she\u2019d touched him directly.</p><p>She slid off the stool and stood. \u201cDo we know enough to hunt the bastard who killed him?\u201d</p><p>Her use of \u201cwe\u201d didn\u2019t escape him. \u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>Damien shot her another look, this one less antagonistic than the previous. \u201cFrom what I could gather, Phineas was ambushed. He stopped only to feed the lycans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is the surviving guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t authorize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was him or me, Captain.\u201d Damien straightened his shoulders. \u201cHe charged me. I was forced to defend myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe assaulted you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried. In my opinion, it was a deliberate suicide.\u201d</p><p>Elijah had been correct in saying that no lycan would be able to watch their mate die on purpose\u2014they couldn\u2019t live without each other. But if the surviving lycan planned on dying shortly after . . . ? \u201cPhineas\u2019s wound\u2014you said his throat had been gnawed on. Is it possible the bite wasn\u2019t inflicted by a vampire?\u201d</p><p>Damien\u2019s head tilted to one side. \u201cAre you asking if it could\u2019ve been a lycan mauling? Yes, it\u2019s possible, although I would wonder about the lack of blood at the scene. There was some initial arterial spray, but otherwise, he was drained.\u201d</p><p>It was concerning that Phineas had walked into a snare. Sentinels weren\u2019t susceptible to hunger, so it was the lycans\u2019 prompting that led him to pull over where danger awaited him. If Jason\u2019s speculation about a lycan uprising had merit, Adrian was facing a battle certain to spill over into mortal lives. He couldn\u2019t afford to rule anything out. \u201cReport to Jason now, then see me in the morning. I want to go over this again after you two put your heads together. That will be all for tonight.\u201d</p><p>The Sentinel bowed slightly and left the kitchen.</p><p>Lindsay stifled a yawn behind her hand, reminding Adrian that she was mortal and her body was still running on eastern time.</p><p>\u201cLet me escort you to your room,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nodding, she rounded the island, her movements fluid and graceful, despite her exhaustion. \u201cYou and I need to talk tomorrow, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She came to a halt in front of him and crossed her arms. \u201cYou said you wanted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d The urge to pull her close, to take her lush mouth and discover the taste of her was riding him hard. A purely human reaction he couldn\u2019t control. They\u2019d never worked together before, in any of Shadoe\u2019s previous incarnations. Shadoe herself had remained neutral, preferring not to choose between her father and Adrian. This would be the first time they\u2019d work in alignment, pursuing similar goals. The thought of sharing his true purpose with Lindsay, of being known in all ways for whom and what he was, affected him in ways he couldn\u2019t have foreseen. \u201cWant\u201d seemed too tame a word for the power of his attraction to Lindsay Gibson.</p><p>Her lashes lowered, veiling her eyes. \u201cHow bad a sin is it to lust after an angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sin is mine, for lusting after you.\u201d</p><p>Her throat worked on a swallow. \u201cAnd if it goes beyond just lusting? Am I going to get struck by lightning? Or worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that deter you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped I\u2019d earned some brownie points by ridding the world of things like the dragon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you earn more.\u201d He couldn\u2019t wait to get started. Already, she\u2019d proven herself to be remarkably resilient and adaptable. In a matter of hours, she had learned that the vampires and humans she\u2019d thought she knew were only a small piece of a much larger underworld. And she had taken it all in stride, because she was a survivor, a fighter, a woman he anticipated having by his side in the days ahead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill I need them?\u201d Lindsay fell into step beside him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question, so I\u2019m thinking I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sin is mine,\u201d he repeated, leading her down the hallway to the room set aside especially for her. He always made room for her in his homes, as a reminder to himself of both his fallibility and his capacity for humanity. For him, the two were joined. He couldn\u2019t have one without the other, and he had neither without Shadoe.</p><p>They reached Lindsay\u2019s bedroom door. He opened it for her but didn\u2019t move inside. As unavoidable as his transgression was, it was resistible\u2014for now. It wouldn\u2019t be for long. Not after going without her for as long as he had. And Shadoe\u2019s innately assertive sexuality only upped the stakes. Whether she reincarnated during bawdy, adventuresome epochs or in eras of inhibition and repression, she was always quick to seduce him. And he was always quick to fall.</p><p>Lindsay stepped into her room, but hesitated just beyond the threshold. She spoke over her shoulder. \u201cIt probably wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian arched a brow in silent query.</p><p>\u201cDeter me,\u201d she clarified.</p><p>He was smiling when she closed the door.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to teach her how to hunt her own family? Her friends?\u201d Jason asked, following Adrian into his office.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s already doing that.\u201d Adrian rounded the desk. \u201cAnd she\u2019d continue with or without us. This way, I\u2019m giving her a chance to survive.\u201d</p><p>Jason whistled. \u201cAfter all these years, you\u2019re still an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you doubt it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But there are some who wonder if Syre\u2019s daughter makes you . . . human.\u201d</p><p>Not Shadoe herself, but his love for her. Mortal love was not for angels, whose objectivity must be absolute. \u201cThose who have doubts should take them to the Creator. I need the trust of everyone in this unit. If I\u2019ve lost it, I\u2019ve lost my usefulness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re well loved, Captain. I can\u2019t think of one Sentinel who wouldn\u2019t consider it an honor to die for you.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian settled into his chair. \u201cAs I consider it an honor to lead you all. It\u2019s a responsibility I don\u2019t take lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just hard not to feel restless.\u201d Jason scrubbed a careless hand through his blond hair. \u201cOur job is to babysit the Fallen forever. \u2018They shall never obtain peace and remission of sin. They shall petition forever, but shall not obtain mercy.\u2019 Sometimes the punishment seems as much ours as theirs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be it. We have our orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s everything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it should be for you. What are we, if not Sentinels?\u201d</p><p>Jason hesitated a moment, then smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Adrian returned the conversation to his immediate concern. \u201cI want Lindsay put into the training rotation as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? She\u2019s as fragile as an eggshell. She may hold her own with other mortals\u2014maybe even a vampire or lycan with the element of surprise\u2014but hand-to-hand with a Sentinel? Very few beings can survive that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all know our own strength. It\u2019ll be good for us to pay more attention to how we use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt what cost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be an asset.\u201d Adrian swiveled his chair around, absently noting the lightening of the sky that signaled the coming dawn. \u201cNo one sees her coming. That stealth can be useful to us in a variety of ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse her as bait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll definitely be that.\u201d</p><p>Adrian addressed the slightly mocking note he heard in his lieutenant\u2019s tone. \u201cDo you have a problem with your orders?\u201d</p><p>The smile left Jason\u2019s face. \u201cNo, Captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the last forty-eight hours, the two highest-ranking Sentinels were attacked. You saw the minion on the helicopter\u2014she was diseased\u2014and Damien mentioned possible illness in his report on Phineas\u2019s attack. I\u2019ve ordered updates from all the Sentinels in the field. I want you to sift through them as they come in and see if there are similar mentions there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne or more of the Fallen is giving their blood to enable these minions to come after us in daylight. Syre called me about the pilot, so he was aware of her location, but he sounded genuinely surprised by my assertion that I was attacked unprovoked. He suggested that it wasn\u2019t in her nature to make such a move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t trust him. He jacked her up with some kind of drug, then called to see how you fared in your run-in with her. How else would he know she was with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. That was my thought from the beginning\u2014that he was playing innocent to dodge the blame. We both know he wouldn\u2019t call me about just any vamp, so his interest alone speaks to his guilt. But when I mentioned the attack on Phineas, he didn\u2019t say a word. I didn\u2019t expect him to take responsibility for it, but the lack of any acknowledgment whatsoever . . . ? No denial, no questions to fake ignorance, nothing? I find that really fucking strange. He can\u2019t trust me any more than I can trust him, so he\u2019d never admit that his control over the Fallen is slipping. Maybe he\u2019s feigning cluelessness about the attacks, but if he\u2019s not and he really has no idea what\u2019s going on, there could be a cabal or even a coven of vampires out there who are setting us up to war with one another. They can\u2019t take Syre down, but they know I can and that I will if he\u2019s gone rogue, which would leave the field wide-open for a coup.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s brows rose. \u201cHoping you\u2019ll do the heavy lifting? Fuckin\u2019 A. It would be poetic justice if we completed our mission because of a vampire revolt.\u201d</p><p>Adrian had ceased to think in terms of justice and injustice long ago. \u201cI need to know if Syre is behind these attacks or not. Regardless of his culpability or innocence, we can use the information to weaken his hold on the Fallen. Either he\u2019s deliberately jeopardizing their dreams of redemption or he\u2019s jeopardizing them through neglect. Neither is helping their cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir hopeless cause. You want to turn the Fallen against Syre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? As you said, a revolt would benefit us. Especially if he\u2019s making it easy to incite one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Jason left.</p><p>Adrian decided a workout was what he needed to shed his lingering restlessness. Lindsay would wake soon. He needed to have a clear mind to solidify his plans for her before then.</p><p>Lindsay stirred from her dreams before she was ready. Part of her mind still clung to sleep, longing for another touch of wickedly knowledgeable hands, another whisper of firm lips across her throat, another brush of silky white and crimson wings . . .</p><p>Her eyes opened on a soundless gasp, her heart racing and her skin hot. She was painfully aroused, her thoughts filled with flame blue eyes and raw, sexual words spoken in a purring voice of sin.</p><p>Scrubbing a hand over her face, she kicked the covers off and stared at the exposed wood beams above her head. Her future had taken a monumental detour when she\u2019d caught Adrian Mitchell\u2019s eye. Her life had been so black and white before\u2014get up, go to work, come home, and in between kill anything that set off alarm bells. Now everything was so complicated.</p><p>Lindsay rolled out of bed and crossed the massive bedroom to a private bath that was the size of her old apartment back home. There was a fireplace by the bathtub and a stunning mosaic in a shower that had six showerheads. She\u2019d never even stayed in a hotel as luxurious, yet she felt comfortable and at ease. Despite the opulence, the overall effect was soothing. The soft yellow and blue palette kept the space light and airy, a look she gravitated to because her life could be so dark.</p><p>After washing her face and brushing her teeth, she returned to the bedroom and found her gaze drawn to the unadorned wall of windows facing the west. The view was of rocky hills covered in dry native brush. The vista inspired feelings of remoteness and isolation, but she knew the city wasn\u2019t far away.</p><p>She dressed, pulling on a pair of yoga pants and a ribbed tank top.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get used to this,\u201d she warned herself, even as she walked toward the windows. As she neared, the huge center pane slid leisurely to one side, opening the way for her to step out onto the wide deck. The morning air was cool and crisp, luring her outside. Clutching the wood railing in a white-knuckled grip, she took a deep breath and absorbed the enormity of her change in circumstance. The sun rose at her back and a soft breeze buffeted her from the front. Below, two more tiers of the house jutted over a steep craggy drop, but she couldn\u2019t look for more than a moment, her fear of heights kicking in with a vengeance.</p><p>The rush of anxiety startled her. Not because she was feeling it, but because she realized she hadn\u2019t been feeling it until now. All her life, she\u2019d felt rushed and agitated. The sensation was magnified by proximity to nasty creatures, but it was always thrumming inside her regardless. The expectation that she was waiting for something to happen, waiting for the other shoe to drop, had been a part of her existence forever. And now it was gone, leaving behind an unfamiliar but welcome calm. Whatever might happen next, right now\u2014at this moment\u2014she felt grounded and peaceful. To make it even better, she was actually enjoying the serenity.</p><p>As she backtracked away from the edge, a large shadow swept across her back and raced along the railing. She glanced up. Sucking in a sharp breath, Lindsay turned completely around.</p><p>The sky was filled with angels.</p><p>Against the pale pink and gray morning, they dipped and spun in unique, mesmerizing dances. At least a dozen, maybe more, gliding around each other with such grace and skill. Their wingspans were enormous, their bodies so sleek and poised. They were too powerful and athletic . . . too lethal to inspire piousness, but they stirred reverence nevertheless.</p><p>She moved around the corner of the house, discovering that the deck widened extensively at the rear, forming a landing area of sorts. Awestruck and faintly afraid, she remembered to breathe only when her lungs burned. She\u2019d thought she was in over her head with Adrian when he was just a man. Now\u2014</p><p>He stood out even among angels. His pearlescent wings glimmered in the rising sun, the crimson tips streaking across the horizon as he picked up speed. He shot upward like a bullet, then plummeted straight down, spinning in a blur of blood red and alabaster.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s trying to impress you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay dragged her gaze away. She found Damien standing beside her, his hands on his hips and his attention on the aerial acrobatics taking place above them. He was gorgeous: long and sculpted, with his dark brown hair cut short, and sleek, framing eyes nearly as blue as Adrian\u2019s. But unlike Adrian, there was a stillness about him\u2014like an ocean becalmed. His wings were on display, which she suspected was an intimidation tactic. They were gray with white tips, reminding her of a stormy sky. Framing his smooth ivory skin, they created the effect of a classical marble statue brought to life.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s working,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI am impressed. But don\u2019t tell him I said that.\u201d</p><p>A surge of air and the flap of great wings preceded Adrian\u2019s landing in front of her. His feet hit the deck almost silently, something she barely registered because he was bare chested and barefoot.</p><p>Holy shit.</p><p>Wearing only loose black pants and those glorious wings, his luscious body was on full display. Rich olive skin stretched taut over hard, lean muscle. Her hands ached to stroke his beautifully defined biceps and pectorals; her mouth watered with the desire to lick the fine line of hair bisecting his ridged abdomen. As real as her dream had felt, the reality of him was far more devastating. He\u2019d been crafted by a master hand and honed by battle, and she couldn\u2019t stop her mind from translating all that raw masculinity into hot sexual fantasy. The sheer force of his sex appeal was enough to rock her back on her heels and shorten her breath.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he greeted her, with that low resonance in his voice that damn near curled her toes. \u201cDid you sleep well?\u201d</p><p>She dismissed the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu she was feeling as a lack of coffee combined with the remnants of her very erotic dreams. \u201cI was very comfortable. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might sleep for another few hours yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine o\u2019clock back home. For me, that is sleeping in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>Knowing he didn\u2019t eat food himself made his thoughtfulness even more meaningful. \u201cI\u2019d like some coffee, if you have it. And a few moments of your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He shot a speaking glance at a man standing guard, one of the brawny ones. The guy gave a curt nod before entering the house. \u201cWould you like to go inside?\u201d Adrian asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd miss the air show? No way.\u201d</p><p>That earned her a slight smile. She was determined to coax a different sort of smile from him\u2014an intimate one like he\u2019d given her in her dream.</p><p>As he gestured toward a teakwood table set nearby, his wings dissipated like mist. \u201cDamien.\u201d</p><p>The other angel followed, his wings vanishing just as Adrian\u2019s had. Adrian pulled a chair out for her, then rounded the table and sat next to Damien.</p><p>Lindsay was situated so that she faced the east, which set the two impossibly gorgeous angels against the backdrop of sunrise. She took a deep breath, knowing she was at a crossroads. \u201cI\u2019ve taken a serious and sudden detour here. I relocated to California for a job. I had plans, including a hotel reservation last night that I didn\u2019t cancel and will have to pay for. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to take care of it. Just listen.\u201d Her fingertips drummed on the armrests of her chair. \u201cI appreciate the offer you\u2019ve made to train me, and I want to take you up on it. I\u2019d be stupid not to, since I\u2019m self-taught and apparently blind. I can feel what\u2019s not human, but I can\u2019t narrow that down to what I should\u2014and want\u2014to be hunting. That said, I need to be self-sufficient. I need to have my own place, pay my own way, and come and go as I please.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t allow you to put yourself in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t allow?\u201d Lindsay would\u2019ve laughed, but this was a deadly serious turning point in their association. She was well aware that he was a being not of this world, a man of immense wealth in his mortal guise and even greater power as an angel. But she would not be subservient to anyone. Especially him. If she didn\u2019t set the ground rules now, it would be too late.</p><p>The guard returned with a tray bearing a carafe, one mug, cream, and sugar. He set them down in front of Lindsay, then resumed his position nearby. Lindsay wondered why angels would need protection, especially protection provided by individuals who radiated less power. From what she\u2019d gathered from the conversation over dinner, lycans were guarding the angels. There was apparently some kind of organizational structure to this supernatural underground she\u2019d been brutally introduced to as a child. She realized she knew little about the things she\u2019d been hunting, which had made the killing so much easier. She was going to have to put them into context now, possibly humanizing them in the process, while still slaying them.</p><p>Not for the first time, Lindsay wished she could go back in time. If she hadn\u2019t begged her mother to take her on that damn picnic, Regina Gibson might still be alive now.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting down with you,\u201d she went on, \u201cin an attempt to discuss this situation reasonably so we can brainstorm ideas to meet the challenges while still giving me some independence. But if you\u2019re going to take a my-way-or-the-highway stance, I\u2019ve got nothing more to say to you aside from good-bye. I don\u2019t want to be a sitting duck out there, but, frankly, I\u2019d rather take my chances under my own free will than to lose my autonomy.\u201d</p><p>Damien shot a sidelong glance at Adrian, but Adrian never took his eyes off her. There was a faint lifting to one side of his mouth, as if he was tempted to smile. \u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then. Any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair, sliding his long legs forward to assume a graceful sprawl. Her attraction to him presented yet another hurdle. She\u2019d been looking forward to exploring their chemistry before she knew what he was. Now . . . ? Well, it was going to be very complicated. She didn\u2019t have long-term relationships\u2014she barely had time for herself\u2014and she\u2019d never had a fling with a man she worked with, to avoid the postbreakup awkwardness. She knew if she was still living with Adrian after their affair was over, she would have to watch him date other women. She\u2019d never lived with a lover before, let alone with a former lover who had a new girlfriend. Just thinking about Adrian looking at another woman the way he looked at her incited a possessiveness that startled her with its intensity, especially considering how short a time she\u2019d known him.</p><p>She poured herself a cup of coffee and sweetened it, needing her brain cells to hurry up and start firing.</p> <p>\u201cYou do realize,\u201d Adrian began, \u201cthat you can\u2019t continue to straddle your two lives? If you want normalcy, I can see that you have it. Raguel Gadara takes the safety of his employees very seriously. I can arrange for you to move into one of his residential properties. Between work and home and the cessation of your killing, you should be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t quit. Not until I find who I\u2019m looking for. Maybe not even then. I can\u2019t imagine going through life knowing those things are out there terrorizing others, and me not doing something about it.\u201d</p><p>Something flashed in his eyes. Triumph, maybe. \u201cThe alternative is for you to stay here, train hard, and focus on hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there some sort of compromise? Can\u2019t I live off-site, train on the weekends, and call you for backup when something sets off my freak-o-meter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if I could afford to reserve one of my men for the purpose of identifying classification for you, we don\u2019t hunt indiscriminately. We police the vampires, but we can\u2019t exterminate them.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s blood went cold. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheir punishment is to live with what they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we humans are . . . what? Collateral damage? We have to live\u2014and die\u2014with what they are, too.\u201d</p><p>The airborne angels began to land. She watched them with both wonder and fury. These beautiful creatures seemed so magical and powerful, yet they were allowing the parasitic vampires to live.</p><p>\u201cWe hunt every day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe kill every day. Is it such a bad thing that we focus on the ones causing the most damage?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him over the rim of her mug. \u201cFair enough. Maybe I can join you on my days off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaguel hired you for a reason. What position did he hire you for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssistant general manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA big job at a big new property. I\u2019m certain you\u2019re extremely qualified, but I imagine it\u2019s quite a step up for someone your age.\u201d</p> <p>Lindsay licked coffee from the corner of her mouth. \u201cAnd he\u2019s paying me too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he expects you to be ambitious, hungry, and willing to put in some long hours.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, resigned. The new job alone would take up all her time. That was one of the things that had made the position so appealing\u2014she might actually get to have a regular life, using her livelihood as an excuse for why she wasn\u2019t hunting as much. A cop-out, yes, but she\u2019d convinced herself that she was taking the best option open to her.</p><p>As angels alighted all around him, Adrian remained the calm center of activity. But he wasn\u2019t the eye of the storm. He was the storm. He was the dark clouds on the horizon, beautiful from a distance yet capable of great violence.</p><p>Lindsay realized she was sitting in the midst of angels, drinking coffee and talking about her new job. Normal, she was not.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She took a fortifying sip. \u201cWow . . . All those hours of studying. For what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you would give up your dream so easily,\u201d Damien said, examining her. \u201cMortals wither without dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHospitality wasn\u2019t her dream,\u201d Adrian explained, sounding so sure. \u201cAn ordinary life was, or at the very least, a semblance of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so wrong?\u201d she asked. She wanted a steady man in her life, the chance to fall in love, hang out with friends, and clock in at a job where she didn\u2019t get coated with ashes. But she also felt guilty for wanting ignorance. What kind of person would rather not know about other people\u2019s suffering just so they could be happy themselves ?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not wrong. Far from it. You\u2019ve never felt comfortable in the mortal world, have you? You\u2019re too beautiful and confident to be a loner, but you never really felt like you fit in.\u201d He looked at her with those knowing eyes, seeing right through her. \u201cThere\u2019s no shame in wanting to feel acknowledged for who you are and at ease in your surroundings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly don\u2019t fit in here.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t deny that, deep down, she felt as if she did. And that Adrian was a large part of the reason why. He knew what she did and he accepted her without hesitation. That gave her a sense of fulfillment she\u2019d never had before.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d But she thought she might.</p><p>God . . . What would it be like to work alongside others who fought the same fight she did, to not feel so utterly alone in this vicious, lethal world she\u2019d been initiated into with her mother\u2019s death?</p><p>Reaching up, Lindsay rubbed the back of her neck. \u201cThis decision should really be much harder to make\u2014 for both of us. I\u2019m going to slow you down and be a liability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>Adrian lifted one shoulder in an artlessly elegant shrug. \u201cThere\u2019s a use for every talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need income,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cRegardless of choosing one life over the other, I won\u2019t accept a free ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMortals,\u201d Damien drawled, \u201care so obsessed with material wealth.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s mouth curved in a ghost of a smile. \u201cEvery day, I\u2019m sending teams all over the world. The duty of making those flight and hotel reservations falls to whoever is unfortunate enough to be near me in the morning; I can\u2019t assign it to my office staff at Mitchell Aeronautics without rousing suspicions. Today, that individual will be you. Barring complete ineptitude or profound dislike, we\u2019ll keep you busy with that task indefinitely. We can negotiate your salary and rent. I provide cell phones, expense accounts, and transportation to all of the Sentinels. You can choose to maintain your own cellular service, but you\u2019ll be carrying two phones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSentinels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the angels you see around us.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s gaze swept over the wide deck. \u201cHow many of you are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne hundred and sixty-two, as of yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotal?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>A short laugh escaped her. \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re willing to put up with me. You need all the help you can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have the lycans,\u201d Damien rumbled.</p><p>She looked at the guards dotting the perimeter of the deck. The disparity in their physical build compared to the angels helped to distinguish them. The angels were lithe and lean, which probably helped them aerodynamically, while the lycans were thicker and more muscular.</p><p>Adrian glanced at Damien. \u201cI want to search the area around where Phineas was attacked, and I think it\u2019s time for me to visit the Navajo Lake pack again.\u201d</p><p>Damien nodded and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll send a reconnaissance team ahead to secure the base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That would allude to fear and distrust, which isn\u2019t a message I want to send.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend a different message then,\u201d Lindsay suggested. \u201cA real one, letting them know you\u2019re coming.\u201d</p><p>Both angels looked at her.</p><p>She waved one hand in a careless gesture. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, so maybe I\u2019m off base, but it sounds like you\u2019re going someplace that poses a risk and you don\u2019t want the people you\u2019re visiting to know you consider it risky. So . . . let \u2019em see you coming. Announce it. That shows fearlessness\u2014you\u2019re handing them the opportunity to do whatever it is you\u2019re worried about. But first, run with Damien\u2019s reconnaissance idea, but on the down low. Canvass the area without them knowing. Put some people around to scope the place out before you send the message that you\u2019re coming. Then watch what they do when they get it.\u201d</p><p>Damien\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cLycans have a strong sense of smell. They would know they were being watched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo send some lycans you trust to do the job.\u201d When she was met with heavy silence, her brows rose. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any lycans you trust? Then why are they your bodyguards? Keeping your enemies close?\u201d</p><p>Adrian gestured for Damien to leave with a jerk of his chin.</p><p>Lindsay watched the angel depart. \u201cAlrighty then. Teaches me to speak out of turn.\u201d</p><p>Unfolding from his chair, Adrian stood. \u201cIt\u2019s a sound, intelligent plan. I look forward to utilizing your input today and in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlatterer.\u201d She wondered where he was going and what she was expected to do in his absence. She needed to call her father, then take some time to figure out what she was going to do about her job.</p><p>He came around the table. \u201cWould you come with me for a few moments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the chair out for her, then set his hand at her lower back. The heat of his palm soaked through her thin tank top, perversely sending goose bumps spreading across her skin. He led her to the railing, away from the others. She was highly aware of his shoulder pressing against the back of hers, and of his scent, which was absolutely delicious. If she could, she\u2019d press her nose into the crook of his neck and inhale deep into her lungs. The fragrance of his skin was addictive, intoxicating . . . Familiar.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he asked softly, his breath gusting softly over the shell of her ear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you,\u201d she whispered back, racked by a shiver of delight.</p><p>They stopped at the end of the deck.</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d There was amusement in his low tone. \u201cWill you give me the benefit of the doubt?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay faced him. He stepped closer, into her personal space. Close enough that only an inch separated them, and she had to tilt her head back to look into his face. His wings materialized, shielding them from prying eyes. Her gaze slid over him, drinking in the leanly muscled expanse of his torso. The tight lacing of his abs stirred a deep, raw hunger to see them tighten in pleasure as he thrust into her. Sexual awareness sizzled across her skin, tightening her body. She licked dry lips and his eyes followed the movement. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He caught her close, one arm banding around her shoulder blades, the other hitching beneath the curve of her ass.</p><p>Every hard inch of him was pressed up tight against her. She felt his cock stir against her lower belly, inciting an answering ache between her thighs.</p><p>Her arms went around his neck. \u201cAdrian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold that thought,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAnd hold on to me.\u201d</p><p>He leaped over the railing.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>Lindsay screamed as they plummeted. She scrambled to wrap herself around Adrian\u2019s lean frame, her legs flailing. His lips pressed to her temple and she fell silent, the terror draining out of her, rushing from her body at the point where he kissed her. His wings spread and they caught air, soaring.</p><p>\u201cAerodynamically,\u201d he said calmly, \u201cI need you not to wiggle.\u201d</p><p>Ticked off that he\u2019d given her no warning, she nipped at his neck with her teeth. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid of heights!\u201d Her legs pretzeled around his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of falling,\u201d he corrected, nuzzling his lips against her cheek. \u201cI would never let you fall.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bullshit. She was falling for him already. Lindsay wondered if he had any idea how annihilating his occasional displays of tenderness were. They knocked her on her ass every time. She might have some defense against the searing intimacy if she thought it was a seduction tactic, but his behavior seemed devoid of ulterior motive. His actions seemed innate . . . or irresistible. The thought that he couldn\u2019t help but be tender with her scared her more than flying without a plane. Fear and arousal created a potent mixture.</p><p>Burying her face deeper into his neck, she clung to his powerful body, feeling every contraction of muscle as he climbed over a rocky hillside. He held her securely, so tightly no air passed between them, with a surety and confidence that soothed her anxiety. Flushed by surging adrenaline, she grew hotter by the moment despite the chill of the morning and her bare arms. Her breasts grew heavy and her nipples puckered into tight, hard tips.</p><p>As they banked to the right, her shirt rode up. Her breath caught at the feel of his bare flesh touching hers. His skin was hot, the hard muscles beneath it flexing as he beat his massive wings. Her hair whipped the sides of her face and her eyes closed. The wind sang with something akin to joy.</p><p>The rippling of his washboard abs against her flat stomach was undeniably sensual, the rhythmic clenching perfectly mimicking how he\u2019d feel while fucking her. The hard length of his erection was a demanding pressure, making it impossible to ignore her own growing arousal.</p> <p>She writhed, rubbing against the thick rigidness of his cock.</p><p>They dropped several feet. She screeched. He muttered something foreign with the vehemence of an expletive.</p><p>\u201cBehave,\u201d he admonished, tightening his hold to the point of immobilizing her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one with the hard-on.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her chest even closer, crushing her breasts against him. \u201cYour nipples prove I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d</p> <p>They crested another hill, then swooped downward, landing neatly in a small clearing on the far side. Lindsay didn\u2019t let go right away. Instead, she did what she\u2019d wanted to do earlier: she pressed her nose against his skin and inhaled. His fingers shoved into her hair, his palm cupping her scalp and holding her near.</p><p>He breathed roughly. \u201cHow you tempt me, tzel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be insulted or turned on when you call me things I don\u2019t understand?\u201d Her tongue fluttered over his throbbing pulse; then she scraped her teeth gently across it.</p><p>Adrian groaned. \u201cDo that again and I won\u2019t be responsible for the gravel you may later find embedded in your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d She stepped back. Glancing around, she realized he hadn\u2019t brought her here for an isolated tryst. The dry brush and rocky ground wasn\u2019t at all conducive to taking their clothes off.</p><p>\u201cSentinels and lycans have very keen hearing,\u201d he explained, restoring his immaculate appearance with a single swipe of his hand through his hair. \u201cIf I want to speak to you privately, I need to do so away from the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you have to say that you don\u2019t want them to hear?\u201d</p><p>His wings dissipated. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what I have to say, but the manner in which I say it. And how I look at you when I say it.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose questioningly.</p><p>His brilliant blue gaze swept over her, lingering on the hardened points of her nipples. She pulled her shoulders back and let him look.</p><p>Adrian\u2019s expression softened. \u201cI don\u2019t bring women to the house. The lycans don\u2019t know what to make of your presence and they\u2019re paying close attention to me, looking for cues.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay tamped down the warmth wanting to spread through her. After a lifetime of feeling out of sync with the world, she was now somewhere she felt comfortable, a place she alone fit into. Was it possible her square peg had finally found a square hole? \u201cOf course you don\u2019t bring women here. How could you explain a legion living under your roof and a pack of wolves prowling the perimeter? Unless there are others out there like me . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI can safely say that you are unique in the entire world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d invited me over for dinner before I killed the dragon.\u201d</p> <p>His arms crossed, which tightened his biceps and made her hot for him all over again. \u201cSome things you just know. I knew when I saw you that bringing you into my life was inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven as a human with nothing special about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was always something special about you, even then.\u201d</p><p>She turned her back to him. Her affection for him was building irrationally fast and she couldn\u2019t seem to stop it. \u201cI can\u2019t see how I\u2019ll be more than a pain in the ass for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you said, they don\u2019t see you coming. You can be a lure for vampires, and I can use you to my advantage. Is that answer acceptable?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay looked over her shoulder at him. Mercenary and ruthless: she didn\u2019t begrudge him that. She understood the need to be that way. If using her to draw in vampires was the way she could be helpful, she\u2019d go along with it. Innocent people were dying. Victims with families, including little children like she\u2019d once been. She wished someone had been mercenary and ruthless in saving her mother. \u201cAn artery to use for bait? Yes, that would be acceptable to me. But I want to know more about the whole angel-turned-vampire thing. And the angel-turned-lycan thing. Knowledge is power and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He waited until she faced him. \u201cShortly after Man was created, two hundred seraphim were sent to earth to observe and report on their progress. These angels were known as the Watchers. They were a scholarly caste and they were given strict orders not to interfere with the natural progression of Man\u2019s evolution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were only supposed to \u2018watch.\u2019 I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t obey.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cI figured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Watchers began to fraternize with mortals, teaching them things they shouldn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe creation of weapons, warfare, science . . .\u201d He waved one hand in a markedly casual gesture. \u201cAmong many other skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m following.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA warrior caste known as the Sentinels was created to enforce the laws the Watchers were breaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you lead these Sentinels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the one responsible for turning the fallen angels into vampires,\u201d she accused, her heartbeat quickening with anger and horror.</p><p>\u201cThey are responsible for what they are. They made the choices that led to their fall.\u201d He studied her with those fathomless eyes. \u201cYes, I administered the punishment. I stripped the Watchers of their wings. Wings and souls are connected, and the loss of their souls led to their blood drinking. But I\u2019m not accountable for their mistakes, any more than a police officer is responsible for the crimes committed by offenders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA better analogy would be a penal system that releases criminals who are more dangerous after incarceration than they were before it.\u201d Lindsay ruffled her curls in frustration. \u201cWhy do they have to drink blood? You don\u2019t, and they were once angels like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still physiologically seraphim. Severing their wings didn\u2019t make them mortal. They can\u2019t ingest the food you eat. We look similar to mortals on the outside, but we are not the same. We aren\u2019t built the same. Your bodies create energy through physical chemical processes; we aren\u2019t designed that way.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly. The wings\u2014and the way they appeared and disappeared\u2014were more than enough proof of how different they were. \u201cAnd what do the lycans do? How do you use them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey scent vampires in hiding, raid nests, and herd vamps into sparsely populated areas where they\u2019ll cause the least amount of damage to mortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said there are a hundred sixty-two Sentinels now. The rest . . . died?\u201d</p><p>His chest lifted and fell with a deep breath. \u201cThey were casualties, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many lycans are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeveral thousand from an original twenty-five, because they can breed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many vampire casualties have there been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundreds of thousands. But they\u2019re still ahead, because they can spread vampirism to mortals much faster than the lycans can reproduce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019ve been stuck with a static number, minus the ones you lose along the way?\u201d Lindsay exhaled in a rush, overwhelmed by the enormity of the task Adrian faced. \u201cWhy can the fallen angel-vampires spread their sickness? I don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an answer for that. If I was to hazard a guess, I would say it has something to do with freedom of choice. The choice of the Fallen to refrain from sharing their punishment, just as they should have refrained from sharing their knowledge. And the choice of the mortals who are Changed into vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming the mortals have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are those who seek the Change. Most especially ones who are ill or crippled in some way. Ones who want to live, no matter the cost.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cWho wants to live like that? I\u2019d rather be dead.\u201d</p><p>Adrian took a step closer. Then another. \u201cThe better question is, who wants to die like that? Most mortals don\u2019t survive the Change. Of those who do, many become feral and have to be put down. The Fallen don\u2019t have souls. When they spread their affliction to mortals, who do have souls, the Change causes irreversible damage. Some minions can survive without a soul, but most lose their empathy and then their minds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call them minions?\u201d Her nose wrinkled. \u201cEven the term is disgusting.\u201d</p><p>A breeze ruffled his hair, luring a thick black lock to hang over his brow. The slight blurring of his sharp perfection made him look younger than the early-thirties range she\u2019d originally pegged him for.</p><p>Lindsay now knew what an illusion that was. His eyes, so brilliantly hued, were ancient. The length of time he was discussing so casually was unfathomable to her. Ages. Eons. Trying to imagine the history he\u2019d seen was almost frightening.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d she said carefully, hooking her thumbs in the waistband of her pants, \u201cto punish angels who taught mortals things they shouldn\u2019t know yet . . . but you\u2019re going to teach me things I wouldn\u2019t know otherwise. Do the rules that applied to the Watchers not apply to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you how to better defend yourself, but within the limitations of your mortal body. Basically, nothing you couldn\u2019t learn elsewhere from mortal masters of self-defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She released the breath she hadn\u2019t known she was holding. \u201cNow that I know the basics, I want to go with you when you leave.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m dealing with. Until I do, it\u2019s too hazardous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someplace safer than by your side?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cBy my side is the most dangerous place for you to be.\u201d</p><p>The temptation he presented proved that, but . . . \u201cI\u2019ll take my chances. Besides, I\u2019m already packed.\u201d</p><p>When his face took on an arrogant look of command, Lindsay held up a hand. \u201cThink carefully,\u201d she warned, \u201cbefore you answer.\u201d</p><p>Adrian paused. The stillness that settled over him was absolute.</p><p>She\u2019d known within moments of meeting him that he was used to giving orders and having them obeyed without question. He was going to have to get over that with her.</p><p>\u201cYour way or the highway?\u201d he asked with dangerous softness.</p><p>Lindsay lowered her hand. \u201cI do what I do\u2014I kill heinous things\u2014to avenge someone. I do it for the victims, because they couldn\u2019t do it for themselves. If I can help someone who has a name and a face, friends, a life I\u2019ve seen . . . Do you understand? You said you would give me a focus, and that\u2019s the kind of focus I want. I want to help you find whoever killed your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hunting today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You\u2019re going after information. You want to see if you can pick up anything around the scene where your friend was killed. And if you find something, you\u2019re not just going to call it a day and come home. I don\u2019t need to be trained to be helpful. I\u2019m lethal already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the element of surprise,\u201d he qualified. \u201cIn hand-to-hand combat you\u2019d be dead before you could blink. And when word gets out about you, you\u2019ll be hunted. You\u2019re not ready for that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can be totally ready for that. And when my time comes, it comes. Everything happens for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m calling bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to take me with you,\u201d she said in a voice that brooked no argument. Then she gave him \u201cthe look,\u201d the one she\u2019d given him in the airport to snare his interest. She wasn\u2019t above using her feminine wiles to get her way.</p><p>He smiled. A full, seductive smile that rocked her back on her heels. \u201cYou can\u2019t manage me, Lindsay. I\u2019m more than happy to be the recipient of your persuasive skills, but not if you\u2019ll be pissed off when it doesn\u2019t get you what you want.\u201d</p><p>That smile was kicking her ass. Crackling electricity raced across her skin, making the hair on her nape stand on end. \u201cAdrian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The curve of his mouth straightened abruptly. \u201cI won\u2019t make a tactical error because of my craving for you. My mission\u2014and, most of all, you\u2014are too important to risk.\u201d</p><p>The tightness that constricted her chest was fueled by respect. She had a sudden crazed desire to crawl all over him naked. \u201cI have responsibilities, too, Adrian. I know those things are out there. I wish I didn\u2019t. I wish I couldn\u2019t feel them coming. But I can, and there\u2019s an accountability that comes with that curse. But that\u2019s all about what\u2019s in it for me. For you, I can be useful and I can watch your back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a Sentinel. I can take care of myself.\u201d As firm as his voice was, it was softened by the warmth in his extraordinary eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay here if you won\u2019t let me come. Childish, I know, but it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got as leverage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blackmailing an angel.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSo sue me.\u201d</p> <p>His wings materialized, flexing along with his jaw. \u201cI can detain you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then my father will create a big stink about me falling off the face of the earth and you\u2019ll have even more trouble on your hands. Hey\u2014don\u2019t get your wings in a twist. It was partly your idea to keep him in the loop. Besides, I know you want to catch the ones responsible, and every day that passes, the trail grows colder. I don\u2019t know if you have the same sixth sense I\u2019ve got or not, but if not, we both know I can find them real quick. And they won\u2019t see me coming. I\u2019m just an average, everyday artery to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmail works both ways, Lindsay. I want something in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d She was instantly on alert. The glimmer in his eyes was too . . . triumphant, almost as if she\u2019d played right into his hands.</p><p>\u201cYour reason for hunting\u2014the someone you\u2019re avenging\u2014I want to know who it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was talking about a generalized \u2018someone,\u2019 \u201d she prevaricated.</p><p>Adrian studied her for a long moment, then said, \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll take something else, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was kissing her before she could blink, having moved so fast it felt like she\u2019d missed entire frames in a film reel.</p><p>She was shocked into stillness. He sealed his mouth over hers, his firm, sensual lips pressing softly. The gentleness was unexpected, considering the tightness with which he cupped her face in his hands. His tongue slid along her bottom lip, then slipped inside. The silken caress in her mouth made her shiver, then moan. Adrian kissed with the leisure of a man who took his time making love, which was a luxury she\u2019d never had time for. Sex was for scratching an itch and for feeling human for a few stolen moments. It had never been this slow, deep melding. And this was only a kiss. What the hell would he be like in bed?</p> <p>Her toes curled. Her hands caught his waistband, hanging on for the ride. Behind her closed eyelids she absorbed the taste and scent of him, the feel of him so close. She felt as if he\u2019d found a way inside her. She was aware of nothing else. Just the feeling of him sifting through her like curling smoke . . .</p><p>Lindsay wrenched away with a curse. \u201cWere you just inside my head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI needed to know if your past was a liability.\u201d Adrian licked his lips as if savoring the flavor of her.</p><p>The primitive gesture did crazy things to her insides, but she was too furious to be swayed by it. \u201cSo you violated my privacy by digging in my brain to find the personal things I didn\u2019t want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d Lindsay would\u2019ve loved to walk away in a huff, but she was stuck by their location. She wondered if he\u2019d planned that all along.</p><p>\u201cI know who you want,\u201d he said, \u201cand I assure you, you\u2019re going to need my help to snare her. You\u2019re definitely going to need my help getting her to identify her accomplices.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, wondering how it was possible to feel violated and hopeful at the same time. He\u2019d seen the attack in her mind, seen that Amazon-sized bitch with the flame red hair and skintight black leather outfit. \u201cYou didn\u2019t recognize the two guys with her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are thousands of vamp males with spiky, crayon-hued hair like that. Even body size and ethnic features aren\u2019t much help when the memory is as fractured by terror and grief as yours is.\u201d His wings flapped restlessly, as if her remembered pain affected him. \u201cAt some point during the attack, you stopped seeing and started focusing on feeling. That\u2019s what resonates most in you\u2014how it felt to watch your mother bled dry, how it felt waiting for your turn.\u201d</p><p>Which never came. There hadn\u2019t been a scratch on her when she broke away screaming for help. The damage they\u2019d inflicted had been entirely mental and emotional. Watching her mother being drained of life. Hearing the lurid taunts. Feeling the pressure of claws against her flesh as she was being held down . . .</p><p>\u201cBut you know the woman?\u201d she pressed, needing a clue. Anything at all that could help her find the vampires responsible for the event that had forever changed her life.</p><p>\u201cOh yes. Vashti is unmistakable. She\u2019s second-in-command of the vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond-in-command . . . Vampires like that are running the show? And that\u2019s not enough to wipe them all out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s enough to wipe her out, and her accomplices.\u201d Adrian\u2019s mouth thinned into a grim line. \u201cYou and your mother were ambushed in broad daylight. The Fallen are the only vampires who aren\u2019t photosensitive. They can bestow temporary immunity to minions by sharing their blood, but either way, one\u2014or more\u2014of the Fallen is ultimately responsible for the attack. Considering that, it\u2019s a wonder you survived. They should have killed you, too, to protect their identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t enough of a threat, I guess. Stupid move on their part.\u201d She blew out her breath in a rush. As pissed off as she was at Adrian for picking her brain without her permission, she also wanted to kiss him senseless. He was now the key to unlocking the mystery of that day. She now had the \u201cwho\u201d; she just needed the \u201cwhy.\u201d Then she could kill the fuckers and close that chapter of her life. \u201cSo, now that we\u2019ve gotten the extortion portion of this discussion out of the way, I\u2019ll be going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will follow orders implicitly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I promise.\u201d Lindsay made a gesture of an X over her chest. \u201cCross my heart.\u201d</p><p>Adrian beckoned her with a crook of his finger. \u201cWe need to head back.\u201d</p><p>Her body hummed with excitement and growing exhilaration. She suspected that if he ever flew with her over longer distances, she just might orgasm midflight. Like a biker bunny who got off on the vibrations of a Harley-Davidson. Adrenaline had always made her hot. Adrenaline combined with Adrian was an inferno. Her gaze took him in, sliding over him from the top of his dark head down to his bare feet . . . which weren\u2019t quite touching the coarse ground.</p><p>She was so screwed.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>Syre swiveled his desk chair around and faced the carefully crafted Main Street scene outside his office window. Reminiscent of a Norman Rockwell painting, the small town of Raceport, Virginia, was modernized by the dozens of Harley-Davidson motorcycles lined in neat rows along the curbs.</p><p>\u201cAdrian admitted he killed her? He just came right out with it?\u201d</p><p>His lieutenant\u2019s normally melodic voice throbbed with anger and sorrow. Vashti paced like a caged animal, her stiletto-heeled boots clicking rhythmically across the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered quietly.</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to retaliate? What are we going to\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything, Father.\u201d</p><p>The eerie calm in his son\u2019s voice broke Syre\u2019s heart more than fury would have. Pushing to his feet, he faced his only living child. Torque lingered in the shadows by the threshold, avoiding the advancing rays of the sun that slanted over Syre\u2019s desk and cut the room in half.</p><p>\u201cNikki wants\u2014wanted\u2014peace between us and the Sentinels.\u201d Torque\u2019s handsome features were ravaged by grief, his sloe eyes red rimmed and his mouth bracketed with deep-set lines. \u201cShe would never wish to be the cause of a war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife didn\u2019t cause this,\u201d Vash snapped. \u201cAdrian\u2019s brought war on himself.\u201d</p><p>Syre clasped his hands at the small of his back. \u201cHe claims she attacked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would agree, but he said she was foaming at the mouth. Rabid. And he didn\u2019t recognize her\u2014he has no idea he killed my daughter-in-law. How is that possible, unless her appearance was drastically altered? Nikki\u2019s been missing for two days. Who knows what was done to her during that time? She could\u2019ve been poisoned with drugs.\u201d He looked at his son, who\u2019d often witnessed just how horribly a minion\u2019s unique body chemistry could react to certain human drugs.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not Nikki, then,\u201d Vash said quickly. \u201cMaybe it was someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was her,\u201d Torque confirmed hoarsely. \u201cI felt the moment her life slipped away.\u201d</p><p>Syre nodded, knowing that the usual bond between vampire and minion was doubly strong when love was involved. He himself felt Shadoe\u2019s deaths keenly, no matter the distance between them. \u201cWhat do we know about the abduction?\u201d</p><p>Torque scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cShe was dropped off at the airport around ten o\u2019clock. I called the coven at midnight, because she was late picking me up in Shreveport. Viktor was sent to look for her. Nikki was gone and there was a trace scent of lycan dogs around the helicopter.\u201d</p><p>Looking at Vash, Syre commanded, \u201cTrack the lycans. Bring them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask.\u201d Her amber eyes were cold and hard as stone. A half century past, a pack of lycans had ambushed and killed her mate. She now harbored hatred so poisonous it was killing her in slow degrees. \u201cI can get them to tell us what Adrian\u2019s orders were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Adrian had something to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Torque frowned. \u201cWho else would be responsible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the bigger question.\u201d</p><p>Vash cursed under her breath. With her waist-length red hair and black leather bodysuit, she embodied popular-fiction descriptions of vampiric beauty. She never hid her fangs, arguing that some mortals paid for vampire teeth veneers. \u201cAdrian told you he killed Nikki. What more do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotive.\u201d Syre arched his neck to relieve the building strain there. His fangs descended with the stretch, just as his former wings used to express his mood. \u201cAt his deepest core, Adrian is a Sentinel. That sounds simplistic, but it\u2019s really not. He\u2019s like a machine\u2014he has his orders and he doesn\u2019t deviate from them. That adherence to accountability is his greatest strength\u2014and his most predictable weakness. He wouldn\u2019t suddenly go rogue; it\u2019s not in his nature. To strike this way\u2014this would be a countermove, not a first assault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe his orders have changed,\u201d Torque suggested wearily.</p><p>Vash snorted. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s lying. He might\u2019ve made up the self-defense story to cover his ass, with the ultimate goal being to piss us off and make us retaliate, so he has an excuse to come after us. Maybe he\u2019s sending a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget, he still answers to the Creator,\u201d Syre said wryly. \u201cAnd if he wanted to make a statement, he would have pinned a note to Nikki\u2019s broken body and left her on my porch. He wouldn\u2019t leave any room for speculation. My guess? Someone wants us to blame him. More disturbing, he thinks I sent Nikki to him in some compromised state of mind, so the reverse is true: we\u2019re being blamed for Nikki\u2019s actions. Who has the most to gain from a war between vampires and angels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lycans.\u201d Vash exhaled harshly and began to pace again. Her long-legged stride ate up the twenty-foot distance between walls, back and forth, at a speed that would give most mortals a headache to watch. \u201cUnderhanded and clumsy suits the dogs, I suppose. But I didn\u2019t think they had the balls\u2014or the brains\u2014to wriggle out of the Sentinels\u2019 collar.\u201d</p><p>Syre smiled grimly. It was a testament to Adrian\u2019s leadership that he\u2019d kept the lycans in his service for so long. Somehow he managed to keep each successive generation indentured by the bargain he\u2019d made with their ancestors.</p><p>To this day, Syre admired the Sentinel leader for his foresight. The lycans\u2019 finite life spans enabled them to breed. Unlike the vampires, who were sterile. Or the Sentinels, who were forbidden to procreate. Adrian needed those lycan pups to supplement his Sentinel ranks, which had never been reinforced.</p><p>\u201cRemember,\u201d Syre said grimly, \u201cthe lycans are descended from our fellow Watchers. They\u2019re distantly related to you and me, so certainly some of our rebellious temperament exists in them. And while they were little more than beasts when they were first infected with demon blood, their mortality has given them an advantage\u2014we remain the same while they\u2019ve evolved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo a renegade lycan or few sets us up to war with the Sentinels. Why? Mass suicide? Their sole purpose for drawing breath is to serve the Sentinels. They\u2019re stuck right in the middle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they no longer want to be. Find the ones responsible for Nikki\u2019s abduction and we\u2019ll ask them, but hold off on taking down any Sentinels for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re justified,\u201d Vash argued.</p><p>\u201cDo as I say, Vashti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Syre.\u201d Pivoting, she went to the door. She moved like the huntress she was, with precision and deliberation. Syre trusted her with his life, just as he\u2019d trusted her with Shadoe\u2019s in her original incarnation. Vash had trained his willful daughter, instilling some much-needed discipline in her, and together the two women had been responsible for the eradication of thousands of demons.</p><p>Vash hugged Torque before passing him, murmuring a promise to hunt down the bastards who\u2019d killed his wife. Then she left, taking her agitated energy with her. In the sudden stillness that descended in her wake, Torque\u2019s shoulders drooped as if the weight of the world was upon them. He\u2019d Changed Nikki because he had fallen in love with her, bestowing immortality so that she\u2019d always be with him. Forever. Unfortunately, immortality was no safeguard against a Sentinel.</p><p>Torque crossed his arms and glared, his eyes glowing a molten amber. \u201cAvenging Nikki is my right, not yours or Vash\u2019s.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbsolutely. But I need something looked into, and it\u2019s too delicate an assignment to trust to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Stepping deeper into the room, Torque halted when the tips of his steel-toe boots touched the line between sunlight and shadow. His brutally short hair stuck straight up in opposing directions, the thick Asian locks bleached nearly white at the tips. It was a style that suited both the exotic features he\u2019d inherited from his mother and his sharp-edged lifestyle. While Syre nurtured small towns that attracted motorcycle enthusiasts, ensuring a steady flow of fresh blood to local cabals and covens, Torque managed an expanding chain of nightclubs that offered haven to fledgling minions.</p><p>Approaching his son, Syre clasped him by the shoulders. There was so much of Shadoe in Torque\u2019s features, all the haunting similarities of twins. Now his daughter was stripped of her genes along with her memories. Once the spitting image of her mother, her incarnations bore the trademarks of someone else\u2019s lineage. Although he loved Shadoe regardless of her exterior, there was a part of him that felt as if he was losing her mother anew every time their daughter was reborn with another woman\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI know this is a terrible time,\u201d he said softly, \u201cbut I have to ask you to drop off the map. In addition to Adrian\u2019s comments about Nikki attacking him, he made a reference to Phineas that concerns me. I need you to find out what\u2019s happened in the last forty-eight hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it.\u201d Torque set his hands over Syre\u2019s. \u201cI need something to focus on now, or I might do something we\u2019ll all regret.\u201d</p><p>Syre pressed his lips to his son\u2019s forehead. He understood all too well. He\u2019d barely survived the loss of his wife and Shadoe. If not for Torque, their deaths would have killed him long ago. \u201cWhen we spread the word that you\u2019ve gone under in mourning, no one will question your absence.\u201d</p><p>It was heartless to use his son\u2019s grief to further his agenda, but he didn\u2019t have the luxury of passing up perfect opportunities.</p><p>God, he felt old and callous. So old that he didn\u2019t recognize the youthful face staring back at him from the mirror on the wall by the door. He looked to be only ten years older than Torque, who most people would guess was in his mid- to late-twenties.</p><p>Torque spoke gruffly. \u201cHow does Adrian maintain control when he\u2019s losing the love of his life every few hundred years? Can you be sure he\u2019s got it together? Shadoe\u2019s been gone a long time, Dad. It has to be fucking with his head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat might be true if he gave a shit. Letting her die again and again . . . never having any memory of her family and the people who love her? That\u2019s cruelty, not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Torque\u2019s eyes reflected his inner torment. \u201cI think I\u2019d do anything to get Nikki back, whatever the cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not like us. If you\u2019d heard him on the phone . . . so calm and unaffected. He\u2019s a seraph in every sense of the word. The soul is everything to him. He can see no purpose in existing without one. You say you\u2019d do anything, but if you were faced with the choice, I know you\u2019d make the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that. I can\u2019t know that. I feel like ripping apart every Sentinel and lycan who crosses my path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s precisely what Nikki\u2019s death was designed to do\u2014make us wild with rage. We have to be smarter than that. If we gather intel first, we can move with precision instead of shooting in the dark. Think of how it would benefit us to cause a rift between the Sentinels and the lycans. All we need is proof that the dogs are conspiring against their masters. We turn that over to Adrian and he\u2019ll do the dirty work for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I looking for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll know it when you see it. If something\u2019s off, you\u2019ll catch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuggestions for where to begin?\u201d</p><p>Syre held his wrist before his son\u2019s mouth, offering the potency of his Fallen blood to assist him on his way. Although Torque\u2019s naphil state gave him an advantage over minions, he was still disadvantaged when compared to the Fallen. Drinking a pint or two of pure Fallen blood would negate that deficiency for a few days.</p><p>Hissing as Torque\u2019s fangs sank into his artery, Syre closed his eyes. \u201cPhineas will be near Adrian. Go to Anaheim. Start there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like flying?\u201d Lindsay queried, eyeing the white-knuckled force with which Elijah clutched the armrests of his seat.</p><p>He looked at her with those beautiful emerald eyes. \u201cNot especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit, taking a private jet is way better than flying commercial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paled as the plane banked slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth quirked. She looked around the luxurious cabin, her palms rubbing over the tan leather of the bucket seat she lounged in. Adrian sat a few feet away, deep in conversation with Damien and a blond guy\u2014Jason\u2014who was smokin\u2019 hot, as all the angels appeared to be.</p><p>She returned her attention to Elijah, who sat across from her on the other side of a table. A table. On a plane. The aircraft was about as cozy as an RV. \u201cYou got stuck with babysitting duty, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He just looked at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that,\u201d she said, feeling bad for him. \u201cI won\u2019t give you any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say that, but I can tell Adrian isn\u2019t happy about bringing you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay finished his thought. \u201cAnd you think that means he\u2019s acting under duress, which makes me troublesome?\u201d</p><p>Again, he just looked at her with those keen eyes. A hunter\u2019s eyes, watchful and assessing.</p><p>Knowing she had to mitigate any speculation that she was a weakness, she said, \u201cCome on. You know him better than that. He\u2019s not the type of guy who does anything he doesn\u2019t want to do.\u201d</p><p>Elijah lifted a thickly muscled shoulder in reply.</p><p>She set her elbow on the table and her chin in her hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk much, do you? I think I\u2019m going to like you, if only because Adrian trusts you to watch his back, but I think for more than that. Hopefully, you\u2019ll grow to like me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to face danger only on the hunt.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay had to absorb that a moment before she understood. \u201cYou think you\u2019ll get in trouble for being friendly with me? If Adrian intended to be territorial, he wouldn\u2019t have assigned you to babysitting duty.\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s face gained more color as his attention shifted from his fear to their conversation. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between ordering me to take a hit for you and allowing us to be . . . friends.\u201d</p><p>Looking over her shoulder again, she found Adrian watching her. He was dressed in tailored khakis and a black dress shirt that she knew must be worth a month\u2019s pay for her, at least. The sleeves were rolled up and the collar undone, exposing just enough of his olive skin to captivate her. So far she\u2019d seen him casually dressed in the airport, half naked just that morning, and now urbanely elegant. Of course, he was stunning in all ways. She was so infatuated with him that she had difficulty looking away. It was Adrian who broke the contact first, smoothly returning his attention to his men.</p><p>Lindsay looked back at Elijah. \u201cSee? Not territorial at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have the same bloodline,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot all of the beast in us comes from demons.\u201d</p><p>Momentarily taken aback by the notion, she eventually nodded her comprehension. Adrian definitely had some wildness in him; she felt it thrumming just beneath the surface.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not surprised.\u201d His verdant gaze narrowed. \u201cHe told you what we are.\u201d</p><p>His tone was pitched so low she had to lip-read as well as listen. She was amazed he was able to speak that quietly with a voice as deep as his.</p><p>\u201cI got the Cliffs Notes version,\u201d she replied, lacking the practice to speak as softly as he did, but trying her damnedest. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure I understand the whole hierarchy thing, though. I mean, clearly the Sentinels are bad-ass, or else they wouldn\u2019t have been able to subdue the Watchers to begin with. Unless the Watchers didn\u2019t put up a fight . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps not as much as they would have, had they known what they would become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? You can\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. Lycans aren\u2019t immortal. I\u2019m only seventy years old.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. Her idea of a seventy-year-old man so did not fit with the serious hunk of beefcake sitting across from her. His thick sable hair hadn\u2019t even one strand of gray in it and his strong, handsome features were unmarred by lines. \u201cWow,\u201d she said.</p><p>Silence descended. Surprisingly, it was Elijah who finally broke it. \u201cWhy do you hunt?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay thought about her answer for a moment. It was a topic she never discussed, because talking about her mother\u2019s death meant reliving the memories of it. But Adrian knew now, and in this new world she was living in, her past was relevant to understanding her. That was something she didn\u2019t take lightly. She had never been fully understood before and hadn\u2019t realized how much she craved acceptance until she\u2019d found it in Adrian. Taking a deep breath, she answered, \u201cI was a victim of a vampire attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you directly, or you\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA family member.\u201d</p><p>Elijah nodded. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re fighting the good fight?\u201d</p><p>His dark brow arched. \u201cAs if I had a choice. But yes, that motivates me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Lindsay sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t have a choice, either. I thought I did, but I was deluding myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that was a demon last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She winced. \u201cI\u2019m a human\u2014mortal\u2014with bad luck, I guess you could say.\u201d She used to wonder what it would be like to be blissfully ignorant like other mortals were, but it\u2019d been a long time since she had entertained such thoughts. It was pointless, like wondering what her life would be like if she were a cat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything. I feel things. Like a ghost walking over my grave, if you\u2019re familiar with that saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went straight to Adrian the moment you saw him. Is that why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I picked him up because he\u2019s hot.\u201d She embellished the half-truth with a smile, keeping her sense of the weather and its connection to Adrian close to the chest. \u201cI\u2019m a woman, too, you know. Heterosexual. Good-looking guys attract my attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t find it coincidental that you happened to pick out the one angel in the terminal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I said the same thing to Adrian last night, but he had some six-degrees-of-separation explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much my reaction, too, but what do I know? I\u2019m not religious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo says the woman who now lives with angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d Lindsay grinned. \u201cDid you see Adrian\u2019s face when the dragon went down?\u201d</p><p>Elijah\u2019s eyes lit with amusement. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The plane began to descend. She rubbed her hands together. \u201cI hope we find whoever it is we\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d His face hardened, taking on the fierce cast of a predator.</p><p>\u201cYou like hunting, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This time especially.\u201d His irises took on a preternatural glow. \u201cIn addition to Adrian\u2019s lieutenant, this vamp is responsible for the death of two lycans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay wondered how many people Elijah called friends and suspected it was a small, elite group. She rolled her shoulders back and exhaled audibly.</p><p>\u201cYou all right?\u201d he asked, blanching as the plane dropped swiftly.</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, she was actually looking forward to killing something. And she didn\u2019t feel nearly as bad about that as she thought she should.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>Lindsay stepped out of the plane, slipped on her sunglasses, and looked around. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>A warm hand settled in the small of her back, followed by Adrian\u2019s murmur. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She turned all the way around, slowly, until she faced him directly. \u201cWhere is the ground?\u201d</p><p>The runway ended . . . in midair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on a mesa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s crazy enough to build a landing strip on a mesa? If the pilot overshoots, you\u2019re toast.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched, making her long to see him smile again. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>He led her to the airport\u2019s small parking lot, where two sleek dark town cars awaited them. Jason and Damien climbed into the back of the first vehicle, while Elijah slid into the front passenger seat of the second one.</p><p>\u201cSaint George, huh?\u201d she said as Adrian opened the door for her. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to Utah before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful state.\u201d He took the seat beside her and shut the door. The cars rolled into motion. \u201cThe southern half has some gorgeous red rock formations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot far. A little town called Her-ah-kun.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay frowned. \u201cHer-ah-kun? Weird name.\u201d</p><p>Again, he almost smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s spelled like \u2018hurricane.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>A storm. Oh man . . .</p><p>Resolve strengthened her.The city\u2019s moniker couldn\u2019t be a coincidence, not on top of everything else that had happened to her since she\u2019d left Raleigh.</p><p>As they descended into the city, Adrian grew still and silent, but she felt his volatility gathering force with every mile that passed. His best friend was dead. As stoic as Adrian appeared, it was clearly a loss he felt deeply. His pain humanized him, made him more man than angel. It also made her wonder where he sought comfort when he needed it, or if he internalized everything. Surrounded by angels who would die for him, he still seemed so alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She set a hand on the seat between them and surreptitiously linked her pinky finger with his. Although he gave no outward sign of it, Lindsay felt the surprise that jolted him. He caught her hand in a fierce grip, his gaze trained out his window. She draped the top of her canvas messenger bag over their joined hands, shielding the contact from the rearview mirror\u2019s reflection. He gave a quick squeeze of gratitude.</p><p>Oddly moved by being a source of comfort to him, Lindsay contemplated the closeness that had developed between them already. They were opening up to each other in ways they didn\u2019t with others they\u2019d known longer. Why? Why had Adrian planned on taking her to his home last night? A restaurant would have been the wisest choice to prevent her from discovering his secrets. And why was he so intimate with her? So tender . . .</p><p>Why did she let him? Why wasn\u2019t she more guarded with him, as she was with everyone else whose path she crossed?</p><p>She stared sightlessly at the passing vista, wondering why she seemed to attract the strange and weird. Why did she move so fast when she was only human? Her dad had taken her to the doctor for every runny nose and minor rash. She\u2019d had her share of dental and bone X-rays, routine blood work, and even a CAT scan when she\u2019d gotten a concussion from falling off a friend\u2019s backyard playground. There was no medical explanation for her abilities. But she was undeniably different, and her anomalies were fostering an affinity between her and Adrian. She couldn\u2019t decide if that was a blessing or not.</p> <p>They pulled off the road and into the parking lot of a small country hardware store. As the car slid smoothly into a marked space next to the vehicle carrying Jason and Damien, Lindsay looked around to gain her bearings.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Adrian said, before exiting the vehicle.</p><p>Her door opened, and Elijah stood there, tall and impressively intimidating. Although he was a muscular man with broad shoulders, he wasn\u2019t oversized, yet his presence made him seem so. Like Adrian, he clearly was someone you wouldn\u2019t want to piss off.</p><p>Stepping out, Lindsay took a deep breath and scanned her surroundings. Hurricane seemed to be a small, one-main-street sort of town. In addition to the hardware store, there were a couple fast-food establishments, one chain grocery store, and a couple mom-and-pop shops.</p><p>The wind whipped through her hair, screaming. She gasped and took a step back from its vehemence. Elijah caught her arm to steady her.</p> <p>Adrian was beside her before she could catch her breath. \u201cWhat do you feel?\u201d</p><p>She shivered. \u201cThis place crawls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nest, perhaps?\u201d Damien said, joining them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA group of rogue vamps,\u201d Adrian explained.</p><p>Great. Just what she\u2019d always wanted. \u201cThere are definitely more than a few.\u201d</p> <p>Damien looked at Adrian. \u201cYou weren\u2019t kidding. She\u2019s hypersensitive.\u201d</p><p>Adrian gave a curt nod.</p><p>She pulled herself together. \u201cDo we want to dig around now? Or wait for reinforcements?\u201d</p><p>Jason gave her a thorough once-over. \u201cCan you pinpoint their location?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, knowing the wind would steer her in the right direction if she gave it a chance. \u201cThe closer I get to them, the more I\u2019ll feel it. I just need to wander around a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Adrian turned away as if that was all there was to say on the matter. \u201cNow we know Phineas wasn\u2019t followed; he walked into a nest. We can take it from here and track without risking her.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay debated her next move. Challenging him in front of his men wasn\u2019t an option for her, but she also wasn\u2019t going to be denied the chance to help \u201cfor her own good.\u201d</p><p>When no better idea presented itself, she went with the only solution that came to mind\u2014she walked away.</p> <p>She headed toward the main street, figuring the road most traveled was the best place to start; plus she was hoping the highly visible location would prevent Adrian from restraining her\u2014she wouldn\u2019t put it past him. She didn\u2019t doubt that he was capable of tossing her over his shoulder and putting her where he felt was safest. As it was, she felt his gaze on her. For better or worse, her senses were as focused on him as they were on finding their prey.</p><p>Elijah fell into step beside her. His eyes were shielded behind shades, but she knew he was surveying the area with a predator\u2019s meticulousness. \u201cFYI: there are usually consequences for defiance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured. I\u2019m a big girl; I can handle it. Are you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to let you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re damned if you come with me and damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d Her lips pursed. \u201cWhat do you think he\u2019ll do?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNot sure. Insubordination is usually fatal, but I suspect he\u2019ll go easier on you.\u201d</p><p>Apprehension rippled through her, intensifying the disquiet caused by the frantic wind. She was certain Adrian was capable of things she couldn\u2019t even imagine; he wouldn\u2019t have been placed in charge of the Sentinels otherwise. Still, she didn\u2019t fear him\u2014after all, it was her safety he was concerned with in the first place. Worrying about the consequences wasn\u2019t going to get her anywhere. The only thing she could do was what she\u2019d always done: put one foot in front of the other and keep moving forward.</p><p>Fortunately, that reasoning seemed to be doing her good now. With every step she took, Lindsay grew more comfortable. However Adrian felt about her mutiny, he was giving her the lead. She appreciated that. It gave her credit for having a brain and some experience. Considering the cavernous gap between her abilities and his, his show of trust meant a lot to her.</p><p>As she and Elijah walked past a Dairy Queen, she glanced through the windows. There were families and teenagers inside, laughing and eating and living so happily unaware. Lucky bastards.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a girlfriend?\u201d she asked. \u201cOr a wife? Kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not mated.\u201d</p><p>She resisted the urge to see how closely Adrian was following. It would actually be better if she were alone; a group of intimidating hot guys in a town of this size was a dead giveaway that something unusual was going on. \u201cIs that who you lost? Your mate? Sorry\u2014I shouldn\u2019t pry.\u201d</p><p>Elijah looked at her. \u201cIf I\u2019d lost my mate, I wouldn\u2019t be alive now. Lycans languish when their mates die. Death follows swiftly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Like wolves? The real ones. I read that they mate for life.\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention forward again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat happens to humans, too, you know. With couples who\u2019ve been married a long time. The surviving partner usually doesn\u2019t last long after their spouse passes away. Does the same thing apply to vampires? And Sentinels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires pair up, but not for life. Sentinels don\u2019t date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well . . . They\u2019ve got a lot to hide and it\u2019s not like they can commingle among themselves\u2014there aren\u2019t enough of them. I can see why one-night stands would be the best route under those circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo my knowledge, they don\u2019t even have sex. Period. They don\u2019t seem to have a craving for it as far as I can tell. I\u2019ve always gotten the impression the urge was beneath them.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay grinned, knowing damn well Adrian craved sex. The man practically dripped it from his pores. \u201cYou\u2019re just not their type, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSentinels are never without lycans nearby,\u201d he insisted quietly. \u201cI would have heard something from someone.\u201d</p><p>It was the unwavering conviction in Elijah\u2019s tone that caught her, followed by recollections of how collected the Sentinels were. She had yet to see one laugh or really smile. They didn\u2019t even raise their voices, whether with excitement or anger. Not that she\u2019d been around them long enough to make a comprehensive study of it . . .</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d</p><p>She was surprised to realize she believed him. He was one of those guys who just didn\u2019t bullshit. Which left her confused. She knew masculine interest when she saw it\u2014not to mention Adrian had come right out and said what his intentions were. What else could he want from her, if it wasn\u2019t to explore the attraction between them?</p><p>They reached the end of the main drag, where the road veered to the left, turning into a more residential area. Signs said the turnoff for Zion National Park was close.</p><p>\u201cSo are you looking for your soul mate?\u201d she asked. \u201cDoes it work like that? Only one person in the world for you sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. And no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya. This is the wrong kind of life to want any sort of long-term relationship. I threw out that possibility a long time ago.\u201d The wind whipped through her hair. \u201cWe\u2019re close.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cCare to explain the crazy gusts of wind that follow you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in a place called Hurricane. What do you expect?\u201d She jerked her chin at a rocky hill across the street; then she darted across the road at full speed.</p><p>Elijah stayed directly on her heels. \u201cLycans sense danger in the air before we catch scent of it,\u201d he pressed.</p><p>She still considered her weather radar too personal and too revealing to share. She wasn\u2019t sure what exactly it revealed, but it said something about her she\u2019d rather keep to herself\u2014for now.</p><p>Her hand slid under the flap of her messenger bag and gripped the hilt of a throwing knife. They passed some sort of monument, a stone pillar with a brass plaque. There were small homes fanning out in a horseshoe behind it. Old homes from the fifties or earlier.</p><p>\u201cDo you scent equally well in both forms?\u201d she asked, raking the area with an examining gaze.</p><p>The next minute she was bumped in the thigh, drawing her attention to a massive chocolate-colored wolf beside her. She supposed that answered her question.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d She was seriously impressed. \u201cHow did you do that so fast? And where are your clothes?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look that she pegged as exasperated.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she conceded, reaching out to touch his fur to see if it was soft or coarse. It turned out to be somewhere between the two. The lustrous cocoa pelt was relieved by patches of white on his chest and paws, making the overall package both beautiful and regal. \u201cYou\u2019re a really good-looking wolf, you know.\u201d</p><p>Elijah snorted.</p><p>Lindsay moved forward, noting how still the air had suddenly become. Almost stagnant. Protecting her by not blowing the scent of lycan and angel around. Somehow, she knew the angels had taken the high ground. She didn\u2019t look up, but she suspected they were on the hilltop above her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking basement,\u201d she said, to which Elijah chuffed in agreement.</p><p>They moved forward, circling around the horseshoe. An elderly lady sat in a swinging bench on a covered porch. She smiled and waved as they passed, apparently not the least bit concerned by the humongous canine beside Lindsay. Considering the thickness of the woman\u2019s glasses, Lindsay assumed she couldn\u2019t see all that well. It was the only explanation\u2014aside from senility\u2014for dismissing a pony-sized wolf prowling around.</p><p>A gravel path marked by two squat brick lampposts appeared before them in the space between two homes. They followed it around the hill. At the end was a surprise\u2014a home marked by antebellum-style architecture and a dilapidated bed-and-breakfast sign.</p><p>An icy breeze caressed the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding,\u201d she groused aloud.</p><p>While it was obvious the building was no longer in use as lodging, it retained a dignity and style that belied its use as a vampire \u201cnest.\u201d A gardener and a fresh coat of paint was all that was needed to revive the exterior.</p><p>As they neared the small opening in the brick fence surrounding the property, a massive shadow and the flap of wings announced Adrian\u2019s graceful landing in front of her. \u201cThat\u2019s far enough, Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cThink nothing of it. Glad I could help.\u201d</p><p>His features softened. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jason and Damien landed on the other side of the fence in the front yard. To the right was the hill. Behind them, about a half mile away, were the road and the horseshoe-shaped street of vintage homes. To the left were acres and acres of undeveloped land. The nest was hiding in plain sight. Not that Lindsay was overly surprised. The things she killed were usually normal-looking on the exterior. Freakishly so.</p><p>She hung back, staying a good twenty feet away from the fence. Elijah sank onto his haunches beside her. The angels moved forward\u2014Adrian in the middle, Jason to the left, and Damien to the right. Two more wolves appeared, startling her. She wondered where they\u2019d come from, then remembered the two drivers, one for each town car. Or a lycan for every angel. One was a mixture of charcoal gray and white, and the other was a rusty brown and taupe. Both panted softly, as if they were barely containing their eagerness.</p><p>Yet the three beasts surrounded her. Leaving the angels to fend for themselves.</p><p>She reached down and stroked Elijah\u2019s huge head in silent gratitude. The other two took up positions behind him, giving him the lead. Only his ears and eyes moved. Although his stance appeared casual, she knew he could explode into powerful movement in the blink of an eye. All the hunter traits she\u2019d observed in him as a human were multiplied in his lupine form.</p><p>Her attention moved to the angels, who approached the house with their wings flexing at their backs. That surprised her. Why expose such a vulnerability when they weren\u2019t flying? Jason and Damien might be able to retreat by air if they were capable of taking off vertically, but Adrian was on the porch, caged in by two-story-high columns and an overhanging roof.</p><p>Adrian entered the house through the front door, while the other two found alternate ways in that Lindsay couldn\u2019t see from her vantage. Quiet blanketed the area. She shifted from one foot to the other, twirling a throwing blade in one hand and playing absently with Elijah\u2019s ear. \u201cI have a really bad feeling about this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The wind screeched across the vacant plain, making the fine hairs on her arms stand up. Then all hell broke loose.</p><p>Glass shattered as angels exploded out of draped windows in unison, followed by a veritable horde of vampires.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit!\u201d</p><p>The flood of vamps poured toward her, surging over the short wall. Lindsay tossed the blade in her hand, nailing a foaming-mouthed vampire right between the eyes. She kept on throwing, one right after the other, retreating as the lycans lunged forward, forming a barrier to protect her.</p> <p>She looked for Adrian over the writhing mass of limbs. Oh man . . .</p><p>He was cutting a swath through the throng . . . literally. Had she thought his wings were vulnerable? They were deadly. He wielded them like blades, slicing through limbs and torsos, spinning with lethal precision. The sight of him and the other two angels was riveting. Their wings flared like capes, snapping wide, then curving fluidly around their bodies. The burning embers of vanquished vamps spiraled around them in glittering clouds. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off their eerily graceful, macabre dances.</p><p>A high-pitched yelp yanked her attention back to the lycans, and the suicidal vampress who\u2019d latched on to the back of Elijah\u2019s neck. Resisting his violent efforts to shake her off, the wild-eyed bitch held on even as Elijah threw himself to his back and writhed, grinding her into the ground beneath him.</p><p>Lindsay looked frantically for the other two lycans and found them with their jaws full. Steeling her courage, she leaped into the fray. A male vampire darted toward her head-on, playing chicken. Knowing that changing course would only weaken her footing, she charged ahead with a dagger in hand. She staked him in the heart, then used the protruding hilt for leverage to flip over his shoulder and land on the other side.</p><p>She continued without breaking her stride, diving forward as Elijah straightened. Her fist collided with the vampress\u2019s jaw and it gave way with a sickening crack. Dislodged from her hold, the vampress hit the dirt on her back. Elijah rounded on her with a roar, grabbing her by the throat and ripping the flesh to the spine. Lindsay finished her off with a throwing knife to the forehead.</p> <p>A gunshot echoed off the hillside, followed by the unmistakable whine of a ricochet.</p><p>She pivoted. A woman stood on the steps of the house with a shotgun, pumping another round into the chamber. She took aim at Adrian and pulled the trigger. As the report reverberated through her, Lindsay\u2019s lungs seized, preventing her from screaming the warning that howled inside her horrified mind.</p><p>Adrian whipped one wing around, deflecting the bullet with the harsh ping of metal on metal.</p><p>The gun disappeared from the vampress\u2019s hands and appeared at Lindsay\u2019s feet.</p><p>It took a half minute for Lindsay\u2019s brain to lurch into full understanding. Then she caught up the weapon and pumped the fore-end, firing at a vampire charging one of the wolves. She got off six more shots, providing cover for the lycans. When the last chamber was spent, she wielded the shotgun like a club, whacking a vamp attempting to get up from where he\u2019d been sprawled on the ground.</p><p>Risking a glance at the house, she searched for Adrian.</p> <p>He was surrounded on all sides and kicking some serious ass. But the chick on the porch had retrieved another shotgun\u2014a sawed-off one this time\u2014and was lifting it to aim . . .</p><p>Lindsay darted through the opening in the fence, dodging flying bodies and barreling through ash piles. A vamp flew at her from the right and she ducked beneath his sailing body, startling herself with her own agility. She grabbed the last throwing knife from her bag and prepared to hurl it.</p><p>The barrel of the gun swung toward her.</p><p>Lindsay caught the nearest vampire and hauled him in front of her. The shotgun discharged with a deafening boom.</p><p>The vamp jerked against her. Agonizing pain radiated through the forearm she had wrapped around his waist. She dropped to her knees in an exploding cloud of ash, the vampire disintegrating from the fatal shot.</p><p>The three lycans tore up the stairs and attacked the shooter.</p><p>Lindsay gulped in air but couldn\u2019t breathe past the pain. She kept her gaze averted, afraid to look at her arm.</p><p>A vamp galloped on all fours out of the black pit of the front door and leaped toward Adrian. She took him out with the final blade still clutched in her uninjured hand. His ashes billowed over the yellowed, weed-infested lawn just as Adrian slammed his fist into the frothing maw of a snarling vamp.</p> <p>The vampire hit the ground, unconscious. A second later, Lindsay joined him.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>Lindsay woke in a shadowed room. She blinked the sleep out of her eyes, her head turning to figure out where she was.</p><p>Her cheek touched the cool cotton of the pillowcase and she saw Adrian. He sat to the left of her in a round low-backed chair covered in silver damask. He was bare except for a pair of loose-fitting white pajama bottoms and whatever he might be wearing underneath them. He watched her with a searing intensity, his mouth straightened into a dangerous line. Although he didn\u2019t move a muscle aside from blinking, she felt a tornado churning inside him.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she croaked past a dry throat. She must have pushed her body too far; she always felt like hammered shit when she exerted herself beyond her limits.</p><p>He reached for the clear glass pitcher of water on the bedside table and poured a large ration into a waiting tumbler. Then he stood and helped her sit up, propping her back with some pillows before handing her the drink.</p><p>She accepted with a grateful smile. There was a thick cushion of white gauze bandages on her left forearm. Beneath them, pain throbbed dully. She downed the entire contents of her glass and passed it back.</p><p>He picked up the phone beside her and punched a button, ordering room service. They were in a hotel, she realized. The windows to the right of the bed were at least two stories tall and had Tiffany Blue drapes drawn across them. There was a large sitting area beside her and a massive entertainment center at the foot of the bed. Considering the size and opulence of the room and the grand piano she saw through the open living room doorway, they were in . . .</p><p>\u201cLas Vegas?\u201d she queried.</p><p>Setting the phone down, he nodded. He poured her a refill and returned the tumbler to her.</p><p>She blew out her breath. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in Hurricane the day before yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Yikes. \u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d</p><p>His gaze bored into her. \u201cYou were the only one seriously hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is,\u201d he growled, his voice rumbling through the room like thunder, rattling every loose object. \u201cI told you to stay put.\u201d</p><p>Here we go. \u201cThat was my plan, too. Until the vampire on the porch aimed a shotgun at you. Then I couldn\u2019t stand still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck not?\u201d</p><p>God, he was sexy when riled. She\u2019d never seen him show anything besides total self-possession, but he was visibly seething now. \u201cBecause you needed someone at your back. Everyone else had their hands full. I couldn\u2019t take the risk that you\u2019d be spread too thin and leave an opening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could survive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that! You told me yourself that you\u2019ve had casualties. You\u2019re not indestructible. I wasn\u2019t going to stand around and watch you die.\u201d</p><p>If there was any mercy in the world, she\u2019d never have to watch another person she cared about die.</p><p>\u201cSo you decided to make me watch you die?\u201d Again . . .</p><p>The unspoken word slid insidiously and inexplicably through Lindsay\u2019s mind. She winced and pressed her palm against a suddenly throbbing temple. Adrian took the glass from her other hand\u2014the hand that should have been too weak to hold it\u2014and bent to press his lips to her forehead. The pain left her like a receding tide.</p><p>\u201cIf only you could bottle that talent,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Remembering the ninja/Matrix vault she\u2019d done over the vampire, she freaked herself out with her own coolness. How the hell had she known how to do that?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to drive me insane.\u201d Although his voice was once again smooth as silk, the turbulence inside him hadn\u2019t abated. He straightened.</p><p>\u201cCan you open the curtains?\u201d</p><p>Adrian hit a button on the nightstand and the drapes parted, revealing an overcast sky and drizzle. In Las Vegas. Not that it never rained in the desert city, but at this time of year . . . ?</p><p>She looked at him, knowing his mood was once again affecting the weather, which affected her in turn. \u201cYou were really worried.\u201d</p><p>His hands went to his lean hips, exposing the entirety of his perfect torso and delicious biceps. His wings materialized, extending with a sinuous grace. He was so damn beautiful. So fierce and proud. He was like catnip to her. She wanted to roll around with him in a blissful stupor, breathing in that scent of his that drove her wild.</p><p>\u201cWhen you fell to the ground\u2014\u201d He exhaled harshly, his lashes lowering to hide the sudden flaring of his brilliant eyes. His arms crossed his chest and his feathers ruffled, giving so much away with his restless movements. \u201cYes, I was worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t care so much. You don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself. You risked your life for me.\u201d</p><p>He was right. A hard-driving fear of losing him had spurred her into charging a vampire holding a shotgun. It had been a suicide run for anyone, especially for a weak human. But he was . . . Well, he was invaluable to her.</p><p>In such a short time, he\u2019d given her a sense of belonging. He knew the worst and best of what she was, and passed no judgment. As much as her father loved her, Eddie Gibson didn\u2019t know the truth of what she\u2019d seen the day her mother died or how she hunted because of it.</p><p>Lindsay tossed the covers back and swung her legs off the side of the bed. Her bare legs. She froze, realizing she was wearing only a ribbed tank top and boy-shorts underwear. Although she was decently covered, she was suddenly conscious of her need to shower, brush her teeth, and shave her legs. \u201cI have to freshen\u2014\u201d</p><p>The clicking of the door latch told her Adrian had already left the room.</p><p>Vash raced through the forest, darting through dappled sunlight and around bald cypress. Ahead of her, she could hear the harsh and heavy breathing of the lycans she pursued. Flanking her, three of her Fallen captains gave chase with the same penetrating focus she did. The underbrush rustled beneath their feet as they traversed miles in minutes, the fire of vengeance scorching their veins.</p><p>I need only one . . .</p><p>One of them would tell her what she needed to know about Nikki\u2019s death.</p><p>She heard one stumble, then fall. The lycan\u2019s roar of frustration brought a smile to her lips. Reaching over her shoulder, she gripped the hilt of her katana and slid it free of the scabbard slung across her back. The whisper of the blade against the sheath was thunderous to her ears, as she knew it would be for the lycan. The sudden kick of his heartbeat made her fangs extend in anticipation.</p><p>Leaping over a fallen pine tree, she closed the distance between them\u2014close enough to smell the fear underlying the lycan\u2019s natural scent. It was her favorite fragrance, sweeter even than the smell of their blood.</p><p>The charge from the left caught her completely unawares.</p><p>Vash was tackled into the trunk of a nearby tree, her blade flying from her hand to spin madly through the debris of vegetation littering the forest floor. The massive old-growth pine shuddered in protest, leaves falling around her like rain.</p><p>Dazed by the ambush, it took her a moment to register the threat. The red wolf was lunging toward her again before she even had a chance to summon her blade.</p><p>She could only tense for the blow and pray it didn\u2019t kill her.</p><p>Then she\u2019d be able to kick his ass.</p><p>Adrian stood at the window overlooking the Las Vegas Strip and struggled with the roiling emotions he shouldn\u2019t be feeling. When the door opened behind him, he turned, expecting Lindsay. Instead he found Raguel Gadara entering the penthouse suite as if he owned the place\u2014which he did. The world-famous Mondego Hotel and Resort was the archangel\u2019s property. Regardless, Raguel ranked far below Adrian\u2019s station in the angelic hierarchy. He should show more respect.</p><p>\u201cRaguel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian. I expect you are comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would know if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The archangel hesitated a moment, then dipped his head with the expected deference. His smile was dazzlingly white within the framework of skin as smooth and rich as the finest milk chocolate. There was a smattering of tight gray curls at Raguel\u2019s temples, but that telltale sign of aging was an affectation to disguise his immortality. Unlike Adrian, the archangel embraced the media attention that came his way.</p><p>Raguel withdrew a cigar from his pocket and offered it to Adrian.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The archangel\u2019s grin widened. He was dressed in a loose guayabera and linen pants, but the man-of-leisure appearance was as much of a guise as his gray hair. Like the other six archangels, Raguel was intensely and ruthlessly ambitious. \u201cThat minion you brought along with you . . . He is sick.\u201d</p><p>Foaming mouth. Reddened eyes. Nearly mindless. The infected were like zombies. The nest had been partially filled with them\u2014the diseased living alongside the healthy. Adrian had interrogated the vampress with the shotgun, questioning her about who was responsible for the attack on Phineas the day before. How many of the Fallen were feeding them? Only a few of the members of the nest had been photosensitive. The rest of the group\u2014a rough guesstimate of nearly one hundred minions\u2014had been able to charge into the light of day.</p><p>The woman had laughed for long minutes, gasping for breath. Then, with her amber eyes bright with malice, she\u2019d hissed, \u201cHow does it feel to be hunted, Sentinel? You\u2019d better get used to it.\u201d</p><p>In the end, she\u2019d revealed nothing at all. He\u2019d severed her head with frustration eating at him and fear for Lindsay still riding him hard. The sight of her crumpling to the ground had broken something inside him. He remembered nothing of what he\u2019d done between her collapse and the moment he determined she would live. If Lindsay Gibson died before Syre, the cycle of Shadoe\u2019s reincarnation would continue\u2014another round of waiting for her return and the numbness that accompanied it. But more than that, watching Lindsay fall had elicited a different kind of horror. He\u2019d just discovered her, just begun getting to know her, just started envisioning a few years of hunting with her at his side. Faced with losing the myriad possibilities that lay between them, he\u2019d found a unique hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fear. That\u2019s what he\u2019d felt. He hadn\u2019t recognized it at first because he\u2019d never experienced it before. He knew it now because he had lived through it via Lindsay\u2019s memories; he\u2019d felt the raw terror that had frozen her from the inside out. What she recalled of her mother\u2019s murder was a nightmare capable of warping the minds of adults, let alone that of a child of five\u2014a blood-splattered picnic, a mother\u2019s pleas for mercy for her daughter, a sunny summer afternoon shattered by a child\u2019s screams. The images of crimson dripping from blades of grass and the remembered feel of claws almost breaking fragile skin were so vivid in her mind they\u2019d imprinted themselves in his.</p><p>It was nothing short of miraculous that Lindsay Gibson had matured into the woman she was\u2014strong and sane, determined and compassionate. It was one of the many great ironies in his life that the woman who was his downfall was also responsible for restoring a little of his tarnished faith. She proved that redemption was always possible, no matter how dire the circumstances or how insurmountable the odds.</p><p>And so with his heart racing with fear, he\u2019d joined her in the backseat of the town car and gingerly lifted her unconscious body into his lap. Her decimated arm had lain across her chest, the bone exposed and tendons flayed. The flesh sizzled as the blood he\u2019d squeezed out of a slice in his palm worked its miracle, mending the rent tissues and rebuilding what had been blown away by the shotgun blast. Had she been hit directly, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to save her arm. He couldn\u2019t give her back a lost limb; he could only heal what was still alive.</p><p>She\u2019d risked her mortal life for his.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the first diseased minion I\u2019ve seen lately,\u201d Adrian said, forcing his focus back to Raguel. \u201cI need to figure out what\u2019s wrong with him and how widespread the illness is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the vampires\u2019 time has finally come. Jehovah does love his plagues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI considered that and I can\u2019t rule it out, but I think it more likely that they\u2019re trying to combat their photosensitivity with a new drug that has horrendous side effects. There were too many minions in that nest capable of tolerating sunlight.\u201d Another alternative was that Syre had sent large quantities of Fallen blood to Hurricane. Considering how close the nest was to the Navajo Lake pack, it was a very real possibility. But that wasn\u2019t a speculation he would share with Raguel at this time, if ever.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to have his blood tested?\u201d The glimmer of avarice in the archangel\u2019s dark eyes belied the altruistic nature of his offer.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Adrian intended to have a full blood workup done at home, but he still had to make the trip up to Navajo Lake. Meanwhile, he needed answers and he needed them now. Although it had been proven to be a vampire attack that killed Phineas, it was still necessary to finish the lycan population reduction the lieutenant had started.</p> <p>\u201cI will see to it. If I can be of further assistance, just let me know.\u201d</p><p>Adrian arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019re being helpful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt pays to be useful.\u201d Raguel smiled enigmatically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. If there\u2019s nothing else . . . ?\u201d</p><p>With a slight mocking bow, the archangel left without getting what he\u2019d really come for.</p><p>Adrian stared at the door after it closed, knowing Raguel had visited for one reason and one reason only: to see Lindsay. To see Adrian with Lindsay. To see how vulnerable she made him. The conversation itself could have been managed over the phone.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just the vampires who would smell blood and circle like vultures.</p><p>Fresh from the shower, Lindsay stood in front of the brightly lit vanity mirror and examined her left forearm. Twisting it to and fro, she noted the baby pink hue of the hairless flesh. Although it looked tender, the muscles and tendons beneath had been strong enough to wash her hair with. Her fingers and hand flexed smoothly and with only slightly compromised strength.</p><p>Her arm was regenerating. A fucking miracle.</p><p>She exited the bathroom wrapped in a towel . . . and found a lover\u2019s gift waiting on the bed\u2014champagne-colored silk pajama pants and tank top with a luxurious full-length robe in the same hue. The matching lace thong sealed the deal.</p><p>She stared down at the ensemble for a long moment, then removed her towel and dressed. She couldn\u2019t fight the flare of desire the feel of the silk evoked, but it was tempered by everything she knew and everything she didn\u2019t know. Adrian was intricately complicated, and she had more than enough complications in her life.</p><p>Belting the robe, she moved to the door and stepped out into the living room. Its massive size froze her in midstep. Aside from the grand piano, there was also a full-sized kitchen, dining room, and billiards table. Through a glass partition, she spotted an indoor swimming pool.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s here,\u201d Adrian said, drawing her gaze to where he sat on the couch. His bright white pants were a sharp contrast to the blue of the upholstery. The way his legs were propped on the mahogany and glass coffee table, crossed at the ankles and barefoot, was gracefully erotic. He stood when she entered, his gaze sliding over her in a heated caress.</p><p>He was so human-looking . . . if not for his impossible beauty and sensual elegance.</p> <p>Lindsay went to the dining table and lifted the domed lids from the plates one by one. Pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage and ham, hash browns, orange juice and coffee. A feast for two, but he wouldn\u2019t be eating. She, however, would eat every bite. She always ate for an army after one of her power binges.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he murmured as he resumed his seat and retrieved the iPad lying on the cushion beside him.</p><p>She sat and picked up her fork. \u201cThank you. So do you.\u201d</p><p>His dark head tilted in acknowledgment.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d she asked while slathering butter in between each layer of pancake.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re regrouping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say I\u2019m holding you back.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at whatever was on the screen. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for whatever you did to my arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. But if you ever put yourself in danger for me again, I\u2019ll make you sorry you did.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a glare he didn\u2019t see, while secretly wondering if she was crazy. No sane modern woman would listen to that chauvinistic bullshit and hear a sensual threat in it. But she did, and some primitive recessive gene made her body tingle in response. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a threat. I won\u2019t lose you. I\u2019ve lost too much already.\u201d</p><p>Wincing, she remembered he\u2019d just lost a friend who had been like a brother to him. Her affront drained away. Struggling to find something to say to fill the sudden void, she floundered and managed a lame \u201cThank you for the clothes.\u201d After a mental smack upside the head, she added, \u201cThey\u2019re lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like them,\u201d he said, too neutrally. His control appeared absolute, but the softly howling wind outside and the steady rain told her otherwise.</p><p>Lindsay couldn\u2019t bear his turmoil. She was as scrambled as he was\u2014vulnerable\u2014but she couldn\u2019t hide it the way he did. And she couldn\u2019t let him hide it, either. He knew her secrets, and she needed to maintain that openness now that they\u2019d achieved it. \u201cAlthough they\u2019re clearly not suitable for wearing in public. Are you leaving me behind?\u201d</p><p>Without looking up, he replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll be heading out tomorrow. Together. Until then, you need to eat and rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not really suitable for resting, either.\u201d She poured syrup over her pancakes and began to eat.</p><p>He lifted his head to study her. \u201cAren\u2019t they comfortable?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed her food. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s brows rose in silent inquiry.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re also very sensual.\u201d She stabbed her fork into a sausage link. \u201cDesigned to be sexy for the wearer and for the beholder. But I heard angels might not be wired the same way\u2014sexually\u2014as we mortals are, so maybe you weren\u2019t thinking along those lines when you bought them.\u201d</p><p>Very calmly, he turned off his iPad and set it on the seat beside him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking to Elijah. I would prefer it if you would pose your questions to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, see, that\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t know what to ask.\u201d She bit the end off the link with more gusto than necessary.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps because there\u2019s nothing to question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d she said, chewing. \u201cAre you leading me on? Maybe you picked me up because you needed a female companion for media purposes or a date for an upcoming event. Then I surprised you with the dragon and you\u2019re not sure what to do with me now.\u201d</p><p>He set his elbow on the couch arm and settled in, displaying his body to even better advantage. He might be an angel, but he knew his assets and her weakness for them, and he wasn\u2019t above exploiting both. \u201cOh, I know what to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t do it the other night. And apparently you haven\u2019t been doing it for a long time\u2014if you\u2019ve ever done it.\u201d Oh god. She was getting turned on by the idea of him being a virgin. The thought of training a man like Adrian\u2014the things she could teach him . . .</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he murmured, \u201cthe fact that I\u2019m not promiscuous disturbs you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Lindsay wagged her knife at him. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between discerning and celibate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the celibacy exists because of the discernment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your answer?\u201d</p><p>He examined the fingernails of his right hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was a question on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here\u2019s one. Are angels forbidden to have sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cAny truth to the rumor that lust is beneath you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I want to be beneath you. And I thought we were headed there\u2014eventually\u2014but I\u2019m sensing there\u2019s a whole lot going on I don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p><p>His tongue slid along his bottom lip, making her as damp as if he\u2019d licked her with it. \u201cLet\u2019s head there now.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay wiped her mouth with the napkin in her lap, then pushed back from the table. She moved toward him with a deliberately slow and sultry stride. Her hands went to the belt of her robe, her fingers sliding through the silken knot and loosening it. Reaching the coffee table, she allowed the robe to slide to the floor. She smiled when Adrian\u2019s breath hitched. He straightened, planting his feet wide on the floor and revealing the thick length of his aroused cock. The act of the tease was enticing on its own, but his physical response took her quickening hunger to another level.</p><p>She was yanking an edgy tiger by the tail, and from the sharp, rapacious hunger in his gaze, Adrian was getting ready to pounce. And bite.</p><p>Leaning over him, Lindsay balanced herself with one hand on the back of the couch and allowed her camisole top to gape open. When his gaze slid to the view, she used his distraction as an opportunity to snatch his iPad.</p><p>Straightening, she returned to the table. She resumed eating while using the browser to Google some choice keyword phrases. Like \u201cangel sex\u201d and \u201csentinel angels\u201d and, finally, \u201cwatcher angels vampires.\u201d She was briefly distracted by an article speculating that male Watcher angels had been capable of endless erections, but the deeper import of what she discovered was what, exactly, the Watcher angels had done to get damned with vampirism\u2014they\u2019d lusted after and fucked mortals.</p><p>While she read, Adrian sat on the couch, still and silent. She didn\u2019t look his way, but she sensed the coiled expectancy in him and heard it in the rumble of thunder outside. Inside the air-conditioned suite, it felt like the hour before a heat wave broke with a summer storm\u2014unbearably hot and humid, crackling with bated energy. All the turbulence inside him was primed to explode. She knew he needed the release, just as she instinctively knew she could take him to that point of exposure. But at what cost?</p><p>She forked the remnants of her hash browns into her mouth, then sat back, chewing thoughtfully. Their gazes met and held.</p><p>\u201cAs I suspected, I didn\u2019t ask the right question,\u201d she said, after finishing off the orange juice. Now fed, her body was recharging so swiftly she felt light-headed. \u201cAre you forbidden to have sex? Is that the sin you were talking about the other night? Not the lust itself, but the culmination of it?\u201d</p><p>Adrian set his elbows on his knees and steepled his fingers together. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose my telling you to leave the consequences to me will satisfy you?\u201d</p><p>What would satisfy her was him, hot and hard and deep inside her. But there were consequences, and then there were consequences. \u201cCould you lose your wings and soul and become a vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could lose my mind wanting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d He was killing her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d He set his chin atop his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo. You can\u2019t. And I\u2019d be an idiot to think I\u2019d get away scot-free. My life doesn\u2019t work that way. I pay for everything. In fact, I might have been paying for this\u201d\u2014she gestured between them with an impatient flick of her wrist\u2014\u201cmy whole life. I mean, who has the shit happen to them that\u2019s happened to me? When I was born, maybe someone said, \u2018Yep, that\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to fuck with Adrian\u2019s perfection.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>He straightened abruptly, his gaze haunted. \u201cLindsay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the most powerful warrior in the highest rank of angels. I\u2019ve seen how the others look at you. They trust you. Admire you. To have the power you do, and to look like you do . . . someone up there loves you madly. I\u2019m not going to be the one who screws you up.\u201d Pushing back from the table, she stood, feeling agitated enough to run five miles just to burn energy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adrian stood, too. \u201cThe decision belongs to both of us. There\u2019s something between us. Something precious and powerful. I want it. I want you.\u201d</p><p>His wings materialized, fanning wide. The pearlescent expanse shimmered so beautifully it made her eyes sting. She hadn\u2019t cried since her mother died, but Adrian had brought her close to tears more than once since she\u2019d met him. The way he made her feel important and valuable, the ease with which he accepted her just the way she was . . . For his tenderness alone, she couldn\u2019t allow him to take the fall for her. He made her feel human; he made her feel\u2014period. She was so vibrantly alive when she was with him, as if she\u2019d been half asleep her whole life and was finally stirring. But the humanity he\u2019d returned to her was forbidden to him and she couldn\u2019t afford to forget that. He couldn\u2019t afford for her to forget.</p><p>\u201cI like sex as much as the next gal,\u201d she said, beginning to pace. Adrian was a seraph, just like the Watchers. Same class of angels, same offense\u2014same punishment? She had no reason to believe Adrian wouldn\u2019t suffer the same fate, and he apparently wasn\u2019t going to give her one. \u201cIt can be a lot of fun and a great stress reliever. In a twisted way, I\u2019m flattered to get you so hot and bothered. But it\u2019s not worth sucking blood over. It\u2019s not worth losing those gorgeous wings. Trust me\u2014the buildup is the best part. You\u2019re not missing anything.\u201d</p><p>He moved, traversing the space between them in the blink of an eye and blocking the path of her pacing, forcing her to confront him directly. She stumbled to a halt just before she ran into him. Thunder boomed directly overhead, rattling the silverware on the table.</p> <p>His arms crossed his powerful chest; his irises glowed with pure blue flames. He bared his teeth in a predatory smile. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>Lindsay shook her head emphatically. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Adrian caught her by the shoulders when she made a move to step back. The moment he touched her, he was reminded of the fragility of her mortal body.</p><p>And she\u2019d risked her life for his.</p> <p>He wanted her so much he ached with it. His own vulnerability where she was concerned both enraged and humbled him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI need you, tzel,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo, what you need is for me to be the one strong enough to say no and try to talk some sense into you.\u201d Her gaze lifted beyond his shoulder. Pulling free of his grip, she circled him. \u201cI should have realized before . . . You\u2019re having a rough time right now. You\u2019ve been through a lot in a short amount of time and you\u2019re not thinking clearly. You\u2019re being reckless. Shit, you took on a nest with suicidal odds.\u201d</p><p>She was exquisite. Her hair was still damp, giving the thick curls the hue of pure honey. When she\u2019d come for his iPad, he\u2019d been riveted by her predatory stride\u2014the sensual sway of her hips, the soft rustling of silk as she drew closer. A golden lioness on the hunt. More than a match for him. More than willing to take him on . . . until she discovered the risks he faced.</p><p>Lindsay Gibson was holding back for his benefit, because she was worried about him.</p> <p>Anticipation tightened his spine, the weighted expectation for a touch he wasn\u2019t sure was coming but hungered for anyway. When her fingers brushed tentatively over feathers on his right upper wing, his eyes closed as the barely-there caress moved through him.</p><p>\u201cThese are beautiful,\u201d she whispered in a voice filled with awe. \u201cOh! I thought they were one pair. But there\u2019s . . . three? Oh my god. You have six wings.\u201d</p><p>He could only nod, his throat too tight to speak.</p><p>Her touch grew bolder. She stroked along the upper curve and the wing stretched slightly in bliss. She gasped and stumbled back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause. \u201cThey\u2019re sensitive? But you deflected bullets with them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing manmade can wound a seraph\u2019s wings.\u201d</p><p>She stepped forward again, splaying her fingers and running them lightly over his feathers. \u201cWatching you in action was amazing.\u201d</p> <p>He knew from the low pitch of her voice that the memory was an arousing one, a lingering effect, perhaps, from her time as Shadoe. Or maybe that\u2019s just who she was. Lindsay was a warrior in her own right.</p><p>Eager to soak up the heat of her focused attention and admiration, he unfurled his wings slowly, a silent encouragement for her to continue touching him.</p><p>\u201cEvery angel I\u2019ve seen has had a unique set of wings,\u201d she murmured, torturing him with her gentle petting. \u201cJason\u2019s are dark. Damien\u2019s are gray. There are some similarities among the others, but no one has wings like yours. The touch of red at the tips . . . Gorgeous. Does it signify anything? Or are wing patterns randomly individual, like fingerprints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stain appeared when I severed the wings from Syre. I was the first to spill the blood of an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first ever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay touched the nape of his neck, then slid her fingertips between his wings down the length of his spine. His back arched with a serrated groan, his body trembling.</p><p>\u201cIs this\u2014?\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cIs this erotic to you?\u201d</p><p>Reaching behind him, Adrian caught her right hand. He pulled it beneath his wings and around to his front. She was forced to step closer, her breath near enough to sink through the down to his skin beneath. He wrapped her fingers around the rigid length of his cock.</p><p>She made a soft sound, one he recognized as a cry of vulnerability. Ruthless, he pressed his advantage, stripping the pants from his body with a terse thought and pressing her palm against his bare flesh.</p><p>There was a moment of breathless stillness. He waited for her to jerk away or take over.</p><p>Her voice, when it came, was quiet. \u201cYou did that with the shotgun, too, didn\u2019t you? You took it from the vampire and sent it to me. You did it with the straw in the airport. You can move things, just by wanting to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her hand closed around him.</p><p>His arms fell to his sides, his fists clenching. The clean scent of her body and the rich undertone of her arousal permeated his senses. Lindsay was intoxicating\u2014certain to be addicting.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re burning hot,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou make me that way.\u201d His blood had gone cold the moment he\u2019d learned of Phineas\u2019s death. It had turned to ice when Lindsay had collapsed to the ground with blood splattered all over her. It wasn\u2019t until now, under the heat of her touch, that he finally felt . . . human again.</p><p>She fisted him at the root, then stroked to tip. \u201cAnd big. God, you\u2019re so thick and long. I want this. I want you. So badly. From the moment I first saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me.\u201d His voice was a rasp.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. She had every right to be afraid. She was smart to be. It was only going to get more difficult from here.</p><p>Lindsay pumped him again, harder. Then again.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he growled, thrusting into her hand. \u201cJack me off. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus . . .\u201d She released him.</p><p>Adrian shook with his hunger. He needed her touch. Two hundred years without it had left him dead in all the most fundamental ways. Now every sense and nerve ending was alive again, and desperate for her.</p><p>She came into view, rounding his right wings.</p><p>He stood there, exposed in every way.</p><p>Her gaze locked with his. \u201cTell me the truth, angel. Is this just you and me? Or is this you, me, and a motive I haven\u2019t figured out yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you and me.\u201d His chest tightened with the half-truth. In reality, everything stood between them. His mission, her father, the rules that would deny him the solace of Lindsay\u2019s body . . .</p><p>Tell me the truth, angel.</p><p>He choked on the truth. It wrapped around his throat and squeezed so tightly he could barely breathe, let alone give her the disclosure she deserved. I\u2019m going to pit you against your own people. I\u2019m going to train you how to kill your father. I\u2019m going to send your soul from this earth once and for all. My love will destroy you, and me, and everything we care about. I can\u2019t stop it.</p><p>She slid her recovering left arm around his waist, tucked beneath his wings. Her right hand reached for him again. His breath hissed out between his teeth.</p><p>She stroked him firmly. His wings trembled as lust surged through him. The next pump of her fist was so perfect it was painful.</p><p>\u201cFaster.\u201d He gasped, pulling her closer with an arm around her shoulder.</p><p>Lindsay widened her stance, stabilizing herself with her arm at his waist. She faced him directly, standing perpendicular to his body. He was seared by her proximity. The side of his torso was tucked between her breasts, while her thighs were planted on either side of his. Anchored, she used the leverage she\u2019d gained to fist his aching cock with greater power and speed.</p><p>Adrian\u2019s head fell back in supplication. His wings lifted and curved around them, sheltering their precious intimacy.</p><p>All the while her hand moved on him, her grip strong and the tempo steady. His chest lifted and fell with rapid, heaving breaths. Her breath, too, came quick and hot, gusting over his chest. Her nipples were hard and tight against him, her hips moving in quick, needy little circles. He pressed his lips to her forehead, his eyes stinging.</p><p>\u201cYou get thicker before you come,\u201d she breathed. \u201cAnd harder.\u201d</p><p>Her hand flew as she worked him, pumping him, her speed preternaturally quick\u2014and just what he needed. Two centuries of pent-up desire demanded release now. Then he could seduce her properly. He would lure her into his bed, where he could wrap himself around her and pretend that nothing and no one existed but the two of them. No consequences, no deception, no inevitable and eternal parting.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he panted against her perspiration-damp forehead. \u201cI\u2019m almost there . . .\u201d</p><p>Need coiled around his spine and pooled like molten iron at the base of his cock.</p><p>Ever his temptation, she coaxed him with a voice made husky by her own desire. \u201cShow me. Come for me, Adrian. Come hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep touching me . . . don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I can\u2019t. Let me see you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His entire body jerked with the first wrenching spurt. \u201cLindsay.\u201d</p><p>She made a soft sound of hunger as he shuddered through the explosive climax, her arm tireless as she brought him off with the dedication of a woman who wanted nothing more than to pleasure him.</p><p>I love you. The words clawed their way up from the depths of his soul, threatening to escape.</p><p>Unable to stem the rush of feeling, Adrian smothered the truth with the softness of her mouth.</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s knees buckled the instant Adrian\u2019s mouth sealed over hers.</p><p>He turned in her embrace, cupping her face with gentle hands. As ferociously lustful as he\u2019d been while desperate for orgasm, he was devastating with his tenderness now. His lips were light against hers, his tongue a velvet lash. She caught his wrists, so lost to the scent and taste of him that she didn\u2019t realize they were moving until her back came up against a wall.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, before licking into her mouth.</p><p>A low whimper escaped her. He moved his head slowly, from side to side, sliding his parted lips back and forth across hers. His fingers pushed into her hair and kneaded her scalp. Heated delight coursed through her, permeating her overeager body and soothing her frantic desire. Growing languid under the surprisingly delicate onslaught of his mouth, she reached for his lean hips, pulling him closer.</p><p>\u201cStay out of my head,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your head I want to get into right now.\u201d</p><p>The feel of his cock against her belly, still hard as steel, made her breath catch. Adrian breathed into her mouth, filling her lungs with air from his own. The intimacy was more potent than his fingers sliding down and across her shoulders, pushing aside the thin straps of her camisole. Her back arched, offering her breasts.</p><p>In her mind, she knew it was wrong to be this way with Adrian. She knew she had to stop, that she had to make him stop. Her hands fell away, her palms pressing flat against the wall. But the feel of his touch on her bare skin, his fingertips following the line of her waistband before slipping beneath her top, was sublime . . . so perfect . . .</p><p>She gasped out a laugh, her stomach concaving to flee his questing fingers.</p><p>His beautiful lips curved against her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re ticklish.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s delight was palpable, reverberating through her and shaking her resolve. He gripped her waist and tugged her into an exuberant embrace.</p><p>Oh god . . . she couldn\u2019t take him like this. Sensual. Playful. His brilliant eyes no longer stormy but lit with joy\u2014because of her. It was a level of intimacy she didn\u2019t know, had never experienced in her previous brief sexual encounters. She hadn\u2019t known what she was missing . . .</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . . ?\u201d He kissed her temple, then moved lower, to her ear. \u201cWhere else are you ticklish, Linds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014\u201d The flick of his tongue along the shell of her ear made her shiver. Her hands fisted. \u201cW-we shouldn\u2019t be doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d he purred, cupping her swollen, tender breasts.</p><p>A low moan escaped her. She turned her face toward the wall of windows beside them. The sun was shining brightly, sparkling through the rain droplets clinging to the glass\u2014a reflection of his mood and how she\u2019d lightened it.</p><p>He caught her nipples between thumb and forefinger, tugging lightly. \u201cSuch tiny, delicate nipples for such lush breasts. I\u2019m going to tongue them until you come.\u201d</p><p>Her hips thrust forward without her volition, her sex clenching in greedy demand. \u201cFor a virgin\u201d\u2014she gasped\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re damn good at seduction.\u201d</p><p>Adrian paused, his cerulean eyes glittering with amusement. \u201cYou think I\u2019m virginal?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you saying you\u2019ve done this before?\u201d Jealousy ate at her, cooling her blood. \u201cI thought you\u2019d grow fangs if you got some.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved in a purely male smile. \u201cThere\u2019s only you, neshama. You alone bring out this side of me.\u201d</p><p>She had no idea what he\u2019d just called her, but it struck a deep chord with her, and the way his voice sounded when he said it gave her butterflies. \u201cAdrian . . . Shit. I\u2019m going to burn in hell for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor leaning against a wall?\u201d He licked erotically into her ear. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to do the right thing,\u201d she protested, even as she couldn\u2019t seem to find the will to push him away. Not when one of his wickedly talented hands was sliding into her pants while the other was pushing up her camisole and baring her chest.</p><p>\u201cThis was inevitable. We are inevitable.\u201d His gaze lifted to look into her dazed eyes. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more afraid of not having you than of paying for the privilege.\u201d He cupped her possessively through the lace of her thong.</p><p>Her head fell back, all resistance leaving her as his finger teased along the sensitive crease of her thigh where skin met the edge of lace. There was a vibrating anxiety inside her, a piercing hunger and longing that scared her more than the ramifications of what they were doing. The steamy sensuality that clung to him enveloped her, stoking her desire until she couldn\u2019t think for wanting him. She wanted his touch so badly\u2014craved it.</p> <p>Adrian supported her spine in the cradle of one large hand and arched her toward him. She held her breath, waiting. He blew a cool stream of air over her puckered nipple, and the light constriction of her thong disappeared along with the garment itself. His hot, wet tongue stroked across her at the same moment his fingertips parted her and stroked across her clitoris. She shuddered violently and cried out, so damn turned on she thought she might combust. She was feverish, damp with sweat and the slickness of her arousal.</p><p>He gave a rumbling sound of approval. \u201cSoft and wet. And waxed. Nothing to get in the way while I eat you for hours.\u201d</p><p>Not wax. Laser. But why argue? He liked it. And she liked that he liked it. She also liked the feel of his feather-light touch circling the trembling entrance to her body, and his tongue fluttering over her hardened nipple. She liked the way his wings curved nearly to the wall, forming a shield of white that made her feel safe and protected. Cherished.</p><p>Reaching up, Lindsay ran her hands through the thick strands of his black hair. She lifted one leg and slung it around his hip, opening herself further. \u201cTouch me,\u201d she gasped, writhing as his cheeks hollowed with a quick tug on her breast.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d His breath gusted warmly over the cooling wetness left from his mouth.</p><p>She growled.</p> <p>Two long, elegant fingers pushed inside her. \u201cIs this what you want?\u201d</p><p>Pulling herself up with a grip at his nape, she took his mouth, ravishing it; then she nipped along his jaw down to his throat. Her lips parted over his throbbing pulse, her tongue stroking over it, plumping the thick vein. Then she raked her teeth across it.</p><p>He groaned, catching her with an arm around her back. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking hot. You\u2019re driving me insane.\u201d</p><p>Her hips pumped and circled, riding his fingers. She tossed his words back at him. \u201cGet me off. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s mouth slanted across hers. His thumb pressed against her throbbing clitoris, massaging it with every plunge of his fingers. She sobbed her pleasure into his mouth, her short nails digging into the rock-hard muscles of his shoulders. He caught her tongue and sucked on it, making her sex clench hard on his working hand.</p><p>The silky soft stroke of his chest hair across her aching nipples was killing her, finishing the job begun by his tenderness. Everything about the way he touched her was reverent. Worshipful. Even in the midst of the rawest sexual encounter she\u2019d ever had, she felt like it was all about her. About being with her in every intimate way possible.</p><p>The orgasm hit her like lightning. She quaked in his arms, climaxing violently, the delicate tissues of her sex rippling along wickedly knowledgeable fingers that curved and rubbed in a way that kept her coming.</p><p>Lindsay could only hold on to him, tears squeezing past tightly closed eyelids. Her panting breaths exchanged with his. All the while he kissed her as if he\u2019d die if he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>She\u2019d barely stopped shaking when his fingers left her and she was lifted against him\u2014naked, her clothes gone the way of his . . . wherever that was. Entwined, they spun in a controlled rush; then the cool surface of the dining table was beneath her buttocks and she was reaching back, propping her torso up with her arms canted behind her. Adrian pushed her knee aside with one hand and took his cock in hand with the other. The broad crown was tucked against her.</p><p>His eyes, shimmering with raging blue flames, stared into hers. \u201cI\u2019ve been starving for you, neshama sheli.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d barely sucked in the shaky breath required to ask him what he said when he began the hot, hard slide into her, pushing her to lie back, blanketing her with the scorching heat of his body. Writhing to accommodate him, she gripped his hips, trying to slow the relentless stretching impalement.</p><p>\u201cJesus\u2014\u201d She gasped, her back arching. \u201cWhy the hell are you built like a porn star if you\u2019re not allowed to have sex!\u201d</p><p>His laugh swept over her, leaving goose bumps in its wake. It was such a rich, deep sound\u2014infinitely beautiful and soul stirring. Her heart swelled as if she lived and breathed to hear that sound from him.</p><p>He sank to the root, touching the end of her. His wings extended and flexed luxuriously, reminding her of the sensual stretching of a well-fed feline. Their eyes met and held; so did their breaths. He cupped her face in that breathless moment, staring at her in a way that melted her.</p><p>\u201cAni ohev otach, Lindsay,\u201d he whispered, before taking her mouth and filling her burning lungs with his exhalation. He rotated his hips, sinking a fraction deeper. She swore she felt every inch\u2014every ridged vein and every beat of his pounding heart.</p><p>She held his nape with one hand, licking across his lips, shaken by the absolute surety that she was right where she\u2019d always longed to be and hadn\u2019t known it. \u201cAdrian, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of resonating chimes froze her. And him.</p><p>They clung to each other, breathing hard, his penis a thick, throbbing presence inside her. The full import of what she was doing and who she was doing it with hit her like a deluge of ice water.</p><p>The sound came again, followed by a brusque knocking. A damn doorbell.</p><p>She gasped a sound of relief, then whimpered as Adrian began to withdraw. His gaze never left her as he pulled out with aching slowness and a tightly clenched jaw. The moment he fell heavily from her body, she scrambled from the table and ran to her bedroom.</p><p>He redressed her in her pajamas before she slammed the door shut, but nothing so simple as clothes could make her feel less raw and exposed.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Adrian pushed shaking hands through his hair to straighten it before looking into the oval foyer mirror. Although the sleeveless Asian-style tunic he\u2019d summoned fell to his midthigh and hid his erection, his flushed face and bright eyes, along with lips swollen by Lindsay\u2019s fervency, betrayed his mortal weakness.</p><p>He stared at his reflection, regulating his breathing and willing his countenance into the tight, austere lines he was expected to present. He tucked his wings away, knowing they\u2019d betray his roiling emotions as surely as his gaze did.</p><p>The bell rang a third time, followed by another round of knocking. He yanked on the levered handle of one of the double doors, then walked away as the door began its automated glide back into a locked position. As he crossed the room, he mentally crushed some of the most fragrant flowers in the massive floral arrangements scattered about the vast suite. The cloying scents couldn\u2019t hide the lush smell of sex from the powerful nostrils of an angel, but at least he could show respect by making the effort.</p><p>\u201cCaptain,\u201d Jason greeted him in a slow, knowing drawl.</p><p>\u201cYou have news for me?\u201d He went into the kitchen and washed his hands, rinsing away the now beloved smell of Lindsay\u2019s desire. His blood still raged from the remembered feel of her body\u2019s tight hot clasp. That bright moment of connection would have shattered him if she hadn\u2019t made him laugh, which he hadn\u2019t done in so long he couldn\u2019t recall the last time. He\u2019d forgotten how potent their affinity was. He couldn\u2019t remember it ever scorching him so completely. He felt as if he\u2019d been run through a forge, heated until he was molten, then refashioned into something new and untarnished.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Shadoe?\u201d</p><p>He turned around, feeling an odd agitation at the use of a name he couldn\u2019t yet explain to Lindsay, and found Elijah with Jason. The truth of what he\u2019d been doing before their intrusion wouldn\u2019t escape the notice of a lycan\u2019s more primal instincts. Lindsay\u2019s scent was all over him, and from the flaring of Elijah\u2019s nostrils, the lycan recognized that.</p><p>\u201cLindsay,\u201d Adrian emphasized, \u201cis still recuperating.\u201d</p><p>Jason studied him openly. \u201cBut she\u2019s been up. She . . . ate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a lumberjack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s her arm?\u201d Elijah asked, his face studiously impassive.</p><p>\u201cHealing nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d The lycan gave a brisk nod of satisfaction.</p><p>Adrian crossed his arms, appraising Elijah. There was no longer any doubt the lycan was an Alpha, not after watching him with the other lycans when they cleaned out the Hurricane nest. Also no doubt he was dangerous\u2014his inherent dominance and ability to draw other lycans into following his lead could only result in trouble. For now, however, he was committed to Lindsay. She\u2019d saved his hide\u2014more than once, he said. He would repay that debt by protecting her with his life and, right now, that was just the level of loyalty Adrian needed to keep her safe.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to check with you,\u201d Jason began, moving to the dining table, \u201cabout our plans to head back up to Utah tomorrow. Is that timeline still doable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it was.\u201d Adrian\u2019s voice was low and smooth, but he had to make a concerted effort not to clench his fists as Jason paused before the very spot where he\u2019d been buried inside Lindsay just moments earlier. \u201cSix o\u2019clock sharp I want to be on the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jason set his hand on the table and looked at him. \u201cHelena\u2019s in Vegas. She wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet with her as soon as I change. Elijah, stay with Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>Adrian headed toward his bedroom on the opposite side of the living area from Lindsay\u2019s. He closed the door and sat on the edge of the bed, exhaling harshly before picking up the phone and hitting the button that connected him to her room.</p><p>It took her a long time to answer. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinds . . . Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNo. I\u2019m pretty far from okay.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed. Her embarrassment and confusion were tangible. \u201cI have to go out. Elijah will stay with you. When I get back, you and I will talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need or want anything while I\u2019m gone, charge it to the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh god.\u201d She groaned. \u201cPlease don\u2019t buy me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t think of it. You\u2019re priceless.\u201d</p><p>There was another long pause. When her voice came again, it was laced with steel. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Adrian. You can\u2019t afford me. The price is too high. I won\u2019t let you pay it.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the closed door and cursed under his breath. She needed his attention and reassurance after what they\u2019d just shared, but with the others here he could do nothing to soothe her. There were things he couldn\u2019t yet say, but could show her, if only they had privacy. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk when I get back,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of trouble.\u201d Adrian returned the receiver to the cradle and pushed to his feet. The sooner he took care of business, the sooner he could return to Lindsay.</p><p>Lindsay took a second shower. When she came out of the bathroom, there was another outfit laid out on the bed. This one was on a hanger and covered by a boutique\u2019s protective bag. She revealed the garment inside, finding the outrageously priced tags still attached. It was a beautiful ensemble, with chocolate-hued palazzo pants paired with a multihued turquoise and gold shell. Expensive and elegant, so suited to Adrian\u2019s taste.A makeup case sat beside it, filled with brand-new MAC makeup. And lying innocuously on the bed beneath it all was a money envelope branded with the hotel\u2019s logo, filled with a two-inch-thick stack of crisp hundred-dollar bills.</p><p>She ran her hands down her face with a groan. She was in so far over her head she was drowning. Adrian was too much for her. She couldn\u2019t handle it. Couldn\u2019t handle him. The looks he gave her, the way he spoke to her and touched her . . . whatever the hell they were doing wasn\u2019t a fling for him. And no matter what she said, no matter how hard she tried, he was determined to have her at any cost.</p><p>She dressed and made herself presentable, then settled into the seat Adrian had occupied earlier and called her dad.</p><p>\u201cEddie Gibson, Gibson Automotive,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d She heard the whirring of air tools in the background, and her throat tightened with homesickness. Her father didn\u2019t know about the darker aspects of her life, but he knew she was unusual and he loved her unconditionally anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s me. Sorry I didn\u2019t call sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, baby. Are you feeling better?\u201d His beloved voice was gruff with concern.</p><p>Frowning, she asked, \u201cBetter? Yes, I feel good. Great, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d A relieved sigh crossed the line between them. \u201cI was worried when I couldn\u2019t get ahold of you. Every time I tried your cell, it went straight to voice mail.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah. I haven\u2019t charged it since I got here. It might\u2019ve died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Adrian I appreciate him calling and letting me know you\u2019re all right. If he hadn\u2019t done that, I\u2019d probably have called the national guard to hunt you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian called you?\u201d A tingle moved through her. With everything else he had on his plate, he\u2019d taken a parent\u2019s concern into consideration and went out of his way to alleviate it. His thoughtfulness touched her deeply.</p><p>\u201cYesterday. Told me you were knocked out by a stomach bug. You should take it easy for the next couple of days and drink lots of liquids. And you might consider investing some time in Adrian Mitchell. He sounded like he really cares about you. Could be something there.\u201d</p> <p>If only. She\u2019d finally met a man she didn\u2019t have to lie to or hide from, and she couldn\u2019t have him. \u201cAre you taking care of yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing you\u2019ll nag me if I don\u2019t, yes. Went over to Sam\u2019s last night and played poker, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She\u2019d been pushing him to get out more. A poker night with the guys was a good first step.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you? The caller ID says Mondego Resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Gadara property,\u201d she explained, having noted the Gadara Enterprises logo on the bedside phone as she dialed.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re already back in the saddle then. You need to take care of yourself. You\u2019ve always pushed yourself too hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d she shot back. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal: every time you take a day off, I\u2019ll match it with one of my own.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and she absorbed the sound with delight. \u201cAll right. Deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you. I\u2019ll call again in a couple days, but if you need anything or just want to chat, I\u2019ll make sure my phone is charged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Love you.\u201d</p><p>Returning the receiver to the cradle, Lindsay stood and moved to leave the bedroom, grabbing her messenger bag on the way out. The living area had been devoid of masculine voices for a while now, but she still took a deep breath of courage before opening the door. Hearing her father\u2019s voice had helped her get her focus back, but the feelings of vulnerability and exposure remained. Adrian got to her. As much as she wished it otherwise, she had so few defenses against him.</p> <p>Lindsay found Elijah waiting by the couch, standing with his arms crossed. He was a big, formidable presence. His olive green T-shirt and loose-fitting jeans did little to hide the power of his body. There was such a sense of solidness and steadfastness to him; he was the kind of guy you could trust with your life. He reminded her of Adrian in that respect. Adrian, too, was august and stalwart in an extraordinary way. The feeling he gave of anchoring her was the most difficult aspect of him to resist. She desired him, she liked him, she trusted him. And when she was with him, she felt peaceful, which was a state of being the vampires had stolen from her that long-ago nightmarish day.</p><p>Adrian had given her equanimity back to her. But to return the favor, she had to let him go. As much as he gave to her, she could take everything away from him in a single selfish moment.</p><p>\u201cHi, El.\u201d She smiled at the handsome lycan. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive.\u201d Elijah\u2019s deep voice rumbled across the room. \u201cIn large part, because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You were kicking ass. I just tried to be more than a helpless human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelpless.\u201d He snorted. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not helpless. You\u2019re fucking crazy.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay nodded grimly. \u201cFor the most part.\u201d</p><p>His brilliant emerald eyes swept over her in a clinically examining glance. \u201cHow are you feeling? Is the arm hurting you at all?\u201d</p> <p>She approached him with her hand extended. The pinkness of the flesh was fading and a light dusting of peach fuzz had sprung up since she\u2019d taken her first shower earlier.</p><p>Elijah looked at her arm and whistled. \u201cI thought for sure you\u2019d lose it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was bad, huh?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a wry glance. \u201cYeah. It was nearly blown off by a shotgun.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay remembered the searing agony and hugged her arm, massaging the phantom pain. \u201cHow did he do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish I knew.\u201d</p><p>Since he seemed so fascinated by it, she offered, \u201cYou can touch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>One brow rose. \u201cI don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pissing Adrian off. Curiosity killed the wolf, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. You\u2019re totally overestimating any possessive tendencies on his part. Besides, how would he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d smell me on you.\u201d</p><p>The other brow rose to match the first.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he parroted drily. \u201cHate to embarrass you, but I smell him all over you.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach knotted. \u201cDid you also smell me on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She shook out her hair with agitated hands. \u201cIf I wanted to pack up and run, would I have to ditch you? Or would you let me go peaceably?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to ditch me.\u201d He growled softly. \u201cSee how far you get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have orders to detain me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I won\u2019t let you out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>Because she trusted him, she let him see her turmoil. \u201cI\u2019m playing with fire and I\u2019m going to get burned. I could live with that, but Adrian\u2014he doesn\u2019t need this kind of heat. He\u2019s still recovering from Phineas\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a big boy. He can take care of himself.\u201d Elijah\u2019s features softened. \u201cWorry about taking care of you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved to the table. She remembered vividly what it felt like to have Adrian inside her. The edge to his voice had been as intimate as the physical act, and the foreign words he spoke resonated inside her, striking her in a way that was distantly familiar. She didn\u2019t know their meaning, but she knew they were words spoken from one lover to another. They were as potent as tangible caresses, drifting softly over her skin like a warm breeze. If she was the only one to face consequences, she would take him. Keep him. Make him hers. But it wasn\u2019t that way. He would suffer . . .</p><p>She exhaled in a rush. \u201cMy self-preservation warning light appears to be on the fritz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I noticed the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go pig out, then ride a roller coaster until we vomit.\u201d An adrenaline high or two was the only thing that might save her from bolting. She was strung too tight. If she didn\u2019t loosen up, she was going to snap.</p><p>Elijah sighed. \u201cYou saved my ass for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either that or run away. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He swept his arm toward the double-door entrance to the suite. \u201cBut I\u2019ll warn you now\u2014you really don\u2019t want to puke on me.\u201d</p><p>She started walking, eager to escape the place that had too many dangerous memories. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll puke back,\u201d he said, pulling the door open. \u201cI guarantee I eat more than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEww.\u201d Lindsay was about to step out to the hallway when a dapper African American man filled the threshold.</p><p>She stumbled to a halt, arrested by his megawatt smile. He was instantly recognizable. He was also her boss. \u201cHello, Mr. Gadara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Ms. Gibson. You are just the person I wanted to see.\u201d</p><p>Adrian entered the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 and asked for Helena Bardon. The hostess offered him a bright smile and tried to engage him with small talk, but he offered only monosyllabic answers, his thoughts firmly on Lindsay. The pretty brunette continued to flirt with him as she led him to Helena\u2019s booth, but her warmth quickly faded when she spotted the blonde sliding from the bench seat to greet him. He knew what the hostess saw\u2014a stunning, statuesque, radiantly beautiful woman with waist-length blond hair and seraph blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d Helena pulled him into a warm embrace. \u201cWhen I heard about Phineas, I was so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m managing.\u201d</p><p>Her delicate nostrils flared as she studied him. \u201cYour Shadoe has returned to console you.\u201d</p><p>He gestured for her to sit.</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t judge you,\u201d she said softly, returning to her seat.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d After all this time, Helena remained pure of heart and soul. Her piety was so unassailable; she seemed untouched by the world they lived in. He envied her that serenity.</p><p>\u201cDoes she truly bring you solace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolace and torment, pleasure and pain. All of it in the extreme. It is sublime and it is hell, and I need it to exist. I need her.\u201d There were few Sentinels he could speak so freely to. Helena\u2019s unwavering faith gave her an impartiality few could lay claim to.</p><p>A waiter intruded and they ordered. They would push the food around for appearance\u2019s sake, then box it up for their lycans. When they were alone again, Helena leaned back in her seat and suddenly looked very weary.</p><p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t show how her unrest affected him, but it did. Deeply. She\u2019d always been one of the immutable things in his existence. But then, so had Phineas.</p><p>\u201cBy commiserating.\u201d Her delicate hand rested on the table. \u201cHave I told you that one of my lycans, Mark, claims to be in love with me?\u201d</p><p>Adrian stilled. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, that\u2019s what he believes.\u201d</p><p>Recovering, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not overly surprised by the possibility. You\u2019re a beautiful woman with a gentle soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where the praise for such things should be directed, but thank you.\u201d Her fingertips drummed lightly into the tabletop, a revealing action she seemed to be unaware of. \u201cI made every attempt to be respectful of his feelings, however inconvenient they are. He\u2019s done his job very well because of them. Mark has risked himself in ways and situations no other lycan would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he become a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, he caught her hand, stilling its fidgeting. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew he had . . . needs. I understand the lycan breed. It\u2019s just . . . I refused to see how he handled those needs and he made every attempt to hide his activities.\u201d Her fingers tightened on his. \u201cBut the other day, when I heard about Phineas, I called Mark in after I\u2019d already given him the afternoon off. When he returned, I smelled\u2014I smelled a woman on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelena.\u201d His chest tightened with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI was furious, Adrian. As I have never been before. I raged at him. Said cruel and deliberately hurtful things. Accused him of being weak and flawed. And more . . . so much more. I couldn\u2019t stop. Ugliness poured from me and I couldn\u2019t stop it. I made him hate himself. He was already suffering guilt and shame on his own, and I added the burden of my pain to his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were jealous.\u201d And now she knew what few Sentinels did\u2014that they were as possessive as the lycans and vampires could be. The trait, it seemed, was inherent in the seraphim and was passed on to the Fallen. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been worse. It would have been, had you been sleeping with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the dilemma I come to you with.\u201d Her chin lifted. \u201cYou, of anyone, know how I feel. All this time, I believed the urges of the flesh were beyond us. That lust was one battle we didn\u2019t have to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meant to be tested\u2014you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but as I attempted to explain the situation to Mark, to apologize for the hurt I\u2019d caused him and to prepare him for a transfer away from me, he caught something I had missed. We are forbidden to mate with mortals, Adrian. Lycans, vampires\u2014even demons\u2014are not mortals.\u201d</p><p>He released her hand and sat back, removing himself from the role of friend and returning to that of her commanding officer. \u201cYou\u2019re hoping for a loophole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me!\u201d she snapped, too upset to maintain courtesy. \u201cHow can you even presume to, after coming here with the scent of a mortal woman all over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you expect me to say? Ask yourself\u2014honestly\u2014did you come to me for commiseration? Because you know you have it. My heart breaks for you. But if you came for absolution, I can\u2019t give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I gave you license to make the mistakes I\u2019ve made I\u2019d be no better than Syre. I won\u2019t lead you to damnation, Helena. It\u2019s my responsibility to do everything in my power to prevent your fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo as you say,\u201d she said bitterly. \u201cNot as you do.\u201d</p><p>Her fulminating glare cut into him. In just a few short moments, he\u2019d become her enemy. As deeply as her anger hurt him, he could do nothing differently. \u201cThe answer to your question doesn\u2019t lie with me. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Helena\u2019s lush lower lip trembled. \u201cI ask, and hear nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe conclusion I drew from that,\u201d he said gently, \u201cwas that the silence was answer enough.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a deep, shaky breath. \u201cI thought you would help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. But not in the way you want.\u201d</p><p>A tear formed, then fell down her flawless cheek. Her pain radiated from her and echoed through him. She slid out of the booth. \u201cI need a moment to collect myself.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and watched her weave her way through the dining room and turn down the hall to the restrooms. He pulled his cell phone out and dialed.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d he said when the lieutenant answered. \u201cFind Helena\u2019s personal guards and recall them immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it personally. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it later. If you haven\u2019t recovered both guards within a half hour from now, I need to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d</p><p>The food arrived and Adrian sent it back to be boxed. It took the waiter several minutes to see to it, and Helena failed to return during that time. But Adrian had known the chances of her doing so had been fifty-fifty at best. He understood what she was going through and he knew what he would do if there had been anyone capable of stepping between him and Lindsay\u2014he\u2019d grab her and run, buying what precious little time he could before they were caught.</p><p>He tossed cash on the table to settle the bill. He collected the bagged food containers with one hand while rubbing at the constriction of his throat with the other. He\u2019d given Helena an hour\u2019s head start. It was a pitiful concession, but the only one he could make before the hunt for her and her rogue lycan would begin.</p><p>Adrian hoped she\u2019d had the foresight to have Mark waiting nearby. The alternative\u2014that she might have thought, for even a moment, that he would condone her decision\u2014was too painful to contemplate.</p> <p>If he\u2019d fallen that far in the eyes of his Sentinels, the trials they would face in the days ahead would be insurmountable.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>Vash wiped the blood from her mouth with the back of her hand and bared her fangs at the lycan she\u2019d pinned to a pine tree with a silver-coated blade. Forced into his human form by the silver\u2019s poisoning of his blood he slumped naked with his head hanging, breathing shallowly.</p><p>\u201cYou know whose blood this is,\u201d she said again, nursing her own myriad collection of deep bites and gouges. She waved the rag with the telltale bloodstain on it under his nose. \u201cWhich one of your packmates took the pilot from the airport in Shreveport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. You. Bitch,\u201d he gasped, gripping the hilt of the sword but too weak to pull it free of the wood behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be at this all day.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her from beneath a hank of red hair that was lighter than hers by a few shades. \u201cI\u2019ll be dead in an hour. And you\u2019ll have nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to keel over before you tell me what I want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarking up the wrong tree.\u201d He managed a croaked laugh at his lame pun.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a real comedian.\u201d She gripped his chin and forced his head up. \u201cI see recognition in your eyes. If you\u2019d just spill the name, your pain would be over.\u201d</p><p>He flipped her the bird. \u201cSee this, too?\u201d</p> <p>Vash stared at the lycan with a clenched jaw, wondering if he could possibly be responsible for the death of her mate. It was a question that haunted her with every lycan she met. She had to believe the responsible party was still alive and out there somewhere, waiting for her to exact retribution for the atrocities committed against her beloved Charron. \u201cHow many vampires have you killed, dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-not enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s young,\u201d Salem said beside her, momentarily distracting her with his latest blinding hair color of primary blue. It was fortunate for him that he possessed classical bone structure; there was a regal quality to his handsome face that transcended whatever crayon hue adorned his head. He was also a badass motherfucker. If he hadn\u2019t been, the bull\u2019s-eye on his noggin would have seen him killed long ago.</p><p>She examined the lycan\u2019s face. Beneath the agony and exhaustion that marred it, she could see youth. Perhaps he was too young. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck my dick.\u201d</p><p>Bending forward, she aligned their gazes. \u201cI\u2019m teetering on the brink of releasing you, stupid. Don\u2019t fuck it up.\u201d</p><p>The redhead glared. \u201cFifty.\u201d</p><p>Not him. He would have been a five-year-old pup at the time of Char\u2019s death. She yanked her blade out of the tree and watched the lycan crumple to the forest floor. \u201cGo to the asshole who kidnapped my friend. Tell him Vash is coming for him. Tell him he can meet me like a man, or he can cower like a dog and find himself with my blade in his back.\u201d</p> <p>The lycan\u2019s skin began to ripple with the shadow of fur, a last-ditch attempt to save himself by shifting into his lupine form. In the process, his altering flesh would knit back together faster than it would without a shift.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting him go?\u201d Raze asked, his massive biceps bulging as he cleaned the lycan blood from his blade.</p><p>\u201cIf he makes it out of the woods alive, he deserves to die another day.\u201d</p><p>She turned away and began tracking the path the two lycans had taken as they fled from her. The two Fallen captains fell into line behind her.</p><p>A mile away, Raze caught her arm and looked down at her through his sunglasses. Vash was a tall woman, but the captain towered above her. \u201cSyre wanted us to bring the lycans back to Raceport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one isn\u2019t going to crack, not even for Syre. If we want him to be useful, we need to give him his freedom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chances of him making it back to civilization are practically nonexistent,\u201d Salem pointed out drily.</p><p>Her returning smile was grim. \u201cHe\u2019s motivated. He was willing to die to protect whoever it is we\u2019re after. He\u2019s going to want to get back and give a heads-up that we\u2019re coming, and when he does, he\u2019ll lead us right to the one we want. If necessary, we\u2019ll help him along and make sure he survives long enough to give us a trail.\u201d</p><p>They located the remnants of the lycan\u2019s clothing two miles farther. In his pants pocket, they found his wallet. Pulling out his Mitchell Aeronautics identification card, Vash smiled and waved it. \u201cI thought so. His home address is Angels\u2019 Point. I knew Adrian was involved. Now maybe we\u2019ll be able to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>Adrian paused as he moved past the Mondego\u2019s registration desk. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The front desk clerk reached for the phone. \u201cMr. Gadara would like to see you when you have a moment.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod and continued toward the elevators. His cell phone beeped with a text message just before the doors opened. He pulled it out of his pocket as he stepped inside the waiting car.</p><p>The principal\u2019s on the move, via Gadara. Heading to airport to intercept, but may have to follow to CA. Will report ASAP.</p><p>Because he was partially distracted by planning the logistics of the hunt for Helena and her lycan, it took Adrian a split second to register who\u2019d texted\u2014Elijah\u2014and who the principal was\u2014Lindsay. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>He thrust his hand out just before the doors slid closed, then exited the car in a rush. \u201cI\u2019ll see him now,\u201d he said to the front desk clerk, who directed him to another elevator, which required a key code from the occupant or the front desk to activate it.</p><p>The elevator had only two stops\u2014Raguel\u2019s office and the roof. The doors slid open directly into a massive reception area that kept visitors at bay until Raguel was ready to receive them. Adrian set the bag of food on the receptionist\u2019s desk, then walked right through to Raguel\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d Raguel rose gracefully to his feet from behind his desk and waved off his secretary with an insolent flick of his wrist. Behind him, a wall of windows offered a panoramic view of the city, creating an impressive backdrop for the overly ambitious archangel. \u201cI am afraid the test results have yet to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fucking with the wrong seraph.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Raguel\u2019s smile was knowing. \u201cYou are here about Ms. Gibson. I had assumed your thoughts were focused on more pressing matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now my thoughts are focused on making your life hell. You don\u2019t want me to do that. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no emotion at all in your voice, yet your words are so fierce. Which is it, Adrian? Does Ms. Gibson\u2019s departure truly upset you, or have you simply failed to acquire suitable social skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bait me, Raguel. Where is she?\u201d</p><p>The archangel sank back into his seat with an elegant economy of movement. \u201cShe took my helicopter to the airport, where I believe she intends to catch a flight to California. She was most eager to begin her work as the Belladonna\u2019s assistant general manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour interference in my matters is exceptionally foolhardy. I thought you were smarter than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no right to detain her. Once she stated her desire to leave, I had no choice but to allow her to go. What would you have had me do? Restrain her?\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s back rippled with his aggravation. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to assist her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works for me. How could I not help her when she asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she ask? Or did you offer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it matter? She accepted eagerly.\u201d Raguel\u2019s smile was filled with calculation.</p><p>Pulling out his phone, Adrian sent a quick text to Elijah. Find the principal. Protect her until further notice.</p><p>\u201cI am more than happy to lend you my helicopter as well,\u201d Raguel offered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. If something pressing comes up.\u201d He was almost decided that he shouldn\u2019t go after Lindsay even when it became possible for him to do so. She would be safer if he stayed away. He no longer needed her to lure Syre\u2014the vampire leader was giving him all the excuse necessary without her help.</p><p>And maybe letting Shadoe go was the lesson he\u2019d never learned. Maybe she\u2019d been his test at selflessness and he\u2019d failed to pass it over and over again. Maybe freeing both Shadoe\u2019s soul and the vessel carrying it was the true sacrifice he was expected to make. There was no reason Lindsay Gibson couldn\u2019t live a life separate from him. He\u2019d given her the choice between relative normalcy\u2014a secular job and the cessation of her hunting\u2014or training with him. If she\u2019d chosen the former, there was no good reason for him not to let her go. He knew where she was; he could keep Syre away from her until the time came when he could end this.</p><p>That time was coming soon. Very soon.</p><p>In the interim, he had Helena to contend with. Finding her wasn\u2019t something he would delegate to anyone else. He respected his Sentinels too much to not see to them personally. And when he did find her and separate her from her lycan, it would be best if he could look her in the eye and tell her that he\u2019d made the same sacrifice to his happiness that he was demanding she make to hers.</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me,\u201d Raguel murmured. \u201cYou have risked so much for something you relinquish so easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, Raguel.\u201d He pivoted to leave the room. \u201cBut I know you. Your ambition will be your downfall. Especially if you make an enemy of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you will find,\u201d the archangel called after him, \u201cthat I am a friend worth having in your corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike you, I don\u2019t have a corner.\u201d Adrian stepped into the elevator and faced Raguel, baring his teeth in a feral smile. The archangel\u2019s territory extended only across North America; Adrian had no such limits.</p><p>The elevator doors closed, shutting out the look of sharp consideration on Raguel\u2019s face.</p><p>Shadoe had never run from Adrian before. From the first time she\u2019d seduced him past all restraint, rules, and better sense, she had been ferociously determined to keep him enthralled. It had taken her a long time to break him down initially, a relentless and passionate assault on his senses that led to him falling on her in a mindless rut, driven past all reason. Since then, her incarnations had been consummate seducers and she\u2019d relished his every surrender.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Now he was alone, stripped of the people he\u2019d relied on for support. First Phineas. Then Simone. Lindsay\u2019s departure was equally hard to take. He\u2019d found comfort in her presence and he missed her already. But Adrian refused to allow his losses to impact his ability to carry out his mission.</p><p>He did concede, however, that they were likely the first of many signs that his retribution was nigh.</p><p>Lindsay was still kicking herself when her plane landed at John Wayne Airport. It wasn\u2019t like her to run. She was a doer. A woman who faced things head-on. She didn\u2019t like leaving things to chance or not knowing the score.</p><p>Yet the minute an escape route had been opened to her, she\u2019d bolted. Not because she was frightened. No\u2014that was a lie. Everything about Adrian Mitchell scared the shit out of her. The way he affected her was damn scary. She was so used to making do by herself, keeping to herself, and he got under her skin so deeply, she was already beginning to forget what it felt like without him there. She couldn\u2019t forget, however, what it felt like to be herself. The experience had been freeing, and now she was returning to the cage of the \u201creal\u201d world.</p><p>The sense of loss was almost like grief.</p><p>But she would learn to deal with it. Having Adrian\u2019s soul on the line was powerful motivation. He was too valuable to waste on her.</p><p>The wind, that fickle bitch, taunted her with soft whispers. Adrian . . . Go back to Adrian . . .</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d She exited the terminal with no more than the designer clothes on her back, her cell phone and emergency charger she\u2019d bought at McCarran Airport, and a ridiculous amount of cash in her messenger bag. She intended to pay back every penny she spent, but she hadn\u2019t had the luxury of leaving the money behind. Not while Adrian had her suitcase at his house. Which made it inevitable that she\u2019d see him again. At the very least she had to retrieve her luggage. She could ask him to send someone down the hill with it and spare them both the awkwardness, but she wouldn\u2019t. They had unfinished business, and he deserved the courtesy of hashing it out in person.</p><p>She headed to the nearest taxi stand. For a single surreal day, Adrian\u2019s life had felt like it could be her life. But that was a ridiculous fantasy. His existence was filled with private jets, presidential suites, Maybachs, a home that was showcased on television, dragons, demons, vampires that foamed at the mouth, skies filled with angels, guys that turned into wolves, and regenerating limbs. Meanwhile, she was a mentally scarred, slightly crazy, middle-class mortal with a death wish. Nary the twain shall meet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Downtime to get her head on straight and catch her bearings\u2014that\u2019s what she needed. Then she could plan her next steps. Steps that would lead her away from Adrian. The temptation he presented was too great. She couldn\u2019t trust herself around him.</p><p>Sliding into the backseat of a cab, Lindsay directed the driver to take her to the Belladonna hotel. Mr. Gadara had offered her one of the finished suites until he could make arrangements for her to move into one of his residential properties. She\u2019d been surprised by how sweet he was. For such a powerful and well-known public figure, he seemed remarkably down-to-earth and approachable.</p><p>She pointedly ignored the fact that whatever sort of being was driving the cab was sending out the kind of malevolent, inhuman vibes that would formerly have put him on her hit list.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your lucky day,\u201d she murmured, meeting the curious glance the driver shot her through the rearview mirror.</p> <p>Lindsay pulled her phone out of her pocket and turned it back on. She wasn\u2019t surprised when it chirped a multitude of voice mail and text message alerts. Steeling herself against a suddenly knotted gut, she read the text messages first.</p><p>No trouble til I get there, pls (this is Elijah BTW)</p><p>\u201cAw, fuck,\u201d she muttered, feeling like an asshole for leaving him holding the bag. If he got in trouble because of her . . . Well, he just better not or she\u2019d be pissed at Adrian for not being fair.</p><p>Then Adrian. Call me.</p><p>She dialed his number.</p> <p>\u201cLindsay.\u201d His voice, modulated and smooth, made her grip tighten on her phone. \u201cAre you in Anaheim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I just landed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have left,\u201d he said with the arrogance she was beginning to adore. \u201cThat said, it\u2019s best that you did. Something\u2019s come up. It\u2019ll be a day or two before I can get to you. Elijah will join you until then. Don\u2019t ditch him again.\u201d</p><p>Even across the cellular waves and despite his steady tone, which gave nothing away, she knew he was troubled. She could feel it. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . .\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not okay.\u201d</p><p>Her spine straightened. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a place where it would be safe to discuss it.\u201d He exhaled audibly. \u201cI wish I could speak freely. There are things I want to get off my chest that only you would understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d She leaned forward, prepared to tell the driver to turn around. \u201cI\u2019ll come back if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he said, so simply, as if it wasn\u2019t deeply profound that a being of his power was reliant on her for anything. \u201cBut not now. You\u2019ll be safest at Angels\u2019 Point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually . . .\u201d Lindsay found herself hesitating to put the necessary distance between them. It didn\u2019t seem like the time\u2014not while he needed her. But she couldn\u2019t lie to him or hold off the inevitable, either. Whatever it was they had between them, it was based on baring sides of themselves they exposed to no one else. \u201cI\u2019m on my way to the Belladonna. I\u2019m going to stay there until I can find a place of my own. You said I\u2019d be safe with Gadara.\u201d</p><p>There was a short pause. \u201cKeep Elijah with you at all times. Stay in the hotel as much as possible and don\u2019t hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I know we need to discuss the logistics first.\u201d She\u2019d need his help to take down the vamps who had killed her mother. As reckless as she could be at times, she didn\u2019t have a death wish, and she didn\u2019t want to inadvertently endanger Adrian by crossing a line or breaking a rule she wasn\u2019t aware of.</p><p>\u201cWhen you left Vegas, were you leaving me as well?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach tightened. \u201cI felt like I had to. I . . . want you. If it was just sexually, I\u2019d be okay. But the more I\u2019m with you, the more I like you. I\u2019m not as good at fighting those kinds of feelings. I can\u2019t say no to you, and we both need me to.\u201d</p> <p>The silence stretched out this time. Long enough that Lindsay feared she\u2019d lost him. \u201cAdrian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. You just . . . surprised me. Your decision to leave in order to protect me is unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worth falling over,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d Although his tone didn\u2019t alter, she sensed a change in him. \u201cI like you, too, Lindsay. You fascinate me. For someone of my years, that\u2019s a rare gift. I intended to let you go, if you agreed to stop hunting. But I\u2019ve changed my mind. We\u2019ll pick this up when I get back and reach a compromise.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s brow arched. Adrian compromising on anything wasn\u2019t something she pictured easily. He always seemed to end up getting what he wanted. He was a favored son, this warrior angel with his bloodstained wings. And he captivated her completely.</p><p>\u201cI have to thank you,\u201d she said, \u201cfor calling my dad. He would\u2019ve worried himself sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means a lot to me that you thought of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help but think of you,\u201d he said in a low, intimate tone. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to stop since we met.\u201d</p><p>God . . . she felt the same way. They were in such deep shit with each other. \u201cWhatever you have to do, please be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, neshama. Nothing can stop me from finishing what we started today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to tell me what you\u2019re calling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me again,\u201d he purred, \u201cthe next time I\u2019m inside you.\u201d</p><p>Shivering against a sudden flare of sexual heat, Lindsay said a hasty good-bye and ended the call.</p><p>She knew she\u2019d done the right thing by leaving, but that didn\u2019t stop her from regretting it. Especially now that she knew he needed her with him to listen and offer support.</p><p>Damn it . . . she had to get a grip and think, but her lungs were constricted by a ferocious pressure to return to him. Although her mind knew the most reasonable and selfless course was to stay away, there was a driving need inside her demanding she go back and take him. Claim him. Make him irrevocably hers. The rapacious urge was so intense, it frightened her.</p><p>She\u2019d never had trouble holding to her decisions, but with Adrian it felt like she was battling with herself . . . with a high risk of losing. He was a glorious being, proud and dangerously beautiful. His sole purpose was hunting the very creatures she hated and wished dead. If she destroyed him, if she derailed the work he did\u2014which was so important to her\u2014she\u2019d destroy herself. But knowing the consequences didn\u2019t seem to quiet the furiously whispering devil on her shoulder.</p><p>Holding to her chosen course of action by more willpower than she should have needed, she sent Elijah a text message: c u @ the Belladonna.</p><p>She was glad he was going to be with her. He was a straight shooter. He\u2019d help her keep her head out of the clouds, where angels flew and mortals had no business treading.</p><p>\u201cThis is for the best,\u201d she told herself, earning another wary glance from the driver.</p><p>The verbal reinforcement didn\u2019t help as much as she wished it would.</p><p>\u201cWhatever the most disastrous thing you can imagine is, the reality is worse.\u201d Torque shoved a pillow behind his back and leaned into the headboard attached to the wall. He was careful to keep his leg away from the slender shaft of sunlight sneaking through a tiny parting in the blackout curtains of his motel room. \u201cWord on the street says Phineas is dead\u2014from an unprovoked vamp attack.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause, filled only by his father\u2019s deep and steady breathing. \u201cDead? Are you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs certain as I can be without hearing it from Adrian himself. He\u2019s been out of town since I arrived. My guess is that he\u2019s hunting down those responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt.\u201d</p><p>Torque allocated unlimited resources to the cabal he\u2019d managed to infiltrate into the area, which gave him\u2014and his father\u2014access to fairly accurate reports of Adrian\u2019s and the other Sentinels\u2019 activities. Of course, Adrian kept a high profile on purpose, and Torque had long suspected that the cabal members had gone unmolested only because the Sentinel leader willingly looked the other way. You can see me coming and I\u2019ll still get the jump on you seemed to be his message.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping to meet with him,\u201d Torque said, toying with a throwing star, \u201cto let him know we had nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He might see you as a fair trade for Phineas\u2014someone he loved and relied upon for someone equally valuable to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small sacrifice to keep a war from erupting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t your decision to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d Torque threw the hira-shuriken at the wall, absently noting the star\u2019s position in relation to the wallpaper pattern. His father was too protective, to the point that Vash served as his second-in-command to keep Torque out of the direct line of fire. While Torque understood the motives\u2014and the paranoia that fueled them\u2014it didn\u2019t make the bitter pill any easier to swallow. He wanted to serve the vampire community to the fullest extent he could. There wasn\u2019t anything he wouldn\u2019t do or sacrifice to see them thrive and flourish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already lost one child. I won\u2019t lose both of you.\u201d Torque could imagine his father\u2019s head leaning heavily into the headrest of his office chair. \u201cCome home, son. We have the information we need. Now we need to figure out what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should send Vash on cleanup duty. If we police ourselves first, maybe that will reinforce our innocence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. You can take over the hunt for Nikki\u2019s abductors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like nothing more, but there\u2019s something else.\u201d Torque threw another star, embedding it in the wall directly beside the first. \u201cAdrian\u2019s been spotted with a woman recently.\u201d</p><p>Again, a lengthy stretch of silence. \u201cYou think it\u2019s Shadoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t known him to show interest in any other women. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhineas is gone. Adrian will be deeply aggrieved, maybe enough to break a cardinal rule. We need to be certain of the woman\u2019s identity before we take her.\u201d</p><p>Torque\u2019s hand relaxed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep digging until I know for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s your sister, we need to bring her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll keep you posted.\u201d Pulling the phone away from his ear, Torque turned it off and tossed it on the bed beside him. The hunt for intel distracted him from the grief he couldn\u2019t bear to deal with now. When he\u2019d Changed Nikki, he had done so because he wanted her immortally by his side. Nikki\u2019s life was a sacrifice he hadn\u2019t expected he would have to make. Living without her was killing him. He now understood the venom that coursed through Vash\u2019s veins over the loss of her mate. His agony fueled him, keeping his focus sharp and his need for retribution simmering in his blood.</p><p>A couple more hours until dusk, and then he could hit the streets again. And god help any Sentinel unfortunate enough to cross his path.</p><p>Adrian had just reached Mesquite when his phone rang. \u201cMitchell,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cDo you have an idea of how long the vampire was infected before you captured him?\u201d</p><p>The somberness of Raguel\u2019s voice snared Adrian\u2019s complete attention. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vamp is dead, and the blood sample degraded during testing. It was, I am told, as if his blood turned into a \u2018motor oil\u2013type sludge\u2019 in an instant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to hear that.\u201d Furious was more apt, but he made certain that wasn\u2019t evident in his tone.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you are dealing with,\u201d the archangel went on, \u201cis apparently lethal and perhaps fast-acting, depending on when the subject was infected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Your help is appreciated.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call, Adrian looked at Jason and Damien. They were waiting nearby, looking bleak and disheartened beneath a flashing neon keno sign. Adrian wished he could have spared them this hunt for one of their own, but he couldn\u2019t risk losing Helena or her lycan if they decided to split up. Already Helena\u2019s second guard was traveling separately from the couple, stopping less frequently and swiftly pulling ahead.</p><p>\u201cWe need to capture more minions,\u201d he told them. \u201cInfected and not.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s golden good looks were made stark by concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the end of the vampires is finally nigh.\u201d Adrian returned his cell phone to his pocket. Jehovah does love his plagues, Raguel had said. Perhaps the archangel had been onto something.</p><p>\u201cWhat a blessing that would be,\u201d Damien said grimly, following Adrian around the corner of the casino parking lot in preparation for takeoff.</p><p>Adrian didn\u2019t voice the rest of his thoughts.</p><p>Or we are about to be tested in ways that may yet see the end of us all.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>Lindsay fingered the keypad on her cell phone and debated the wisdom of calling Adrian. She\u2019d been strong the first few days and refrained from contacting him, but the night before had been hard. She had roused from sleep at three in the morning, her thoughts filled with memories from a dream so vivid she still recalled it eight hours later.</p><p>She\u2019d been standing with Adrian in a lush valley. A massive river had flowed beside them, providing the water necessary to support the miles of grasses spreading outward from its banks. The sun was bright and fierce, the air humid and almost too hot. Adrian wore only coarse linen pants and leather sandals, his hair long enough to hang to the tops of his broad, powerful shoulders. His head was tilted back, his eyes closed, his sensual mouth thinned with frustration or displeasure. There was a blade in his hand\u2014a thick, sturdy weapon that reminded her of a medieval sword or glaive, like King Arthur\u2019s Excalibur. He spun it deftly, absently, his skill apparent in his easy familiarity with its weight and length. He was both regal and fierce. Heartrendingly beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As the wind slid lovingly through his hair, he looked at her with such torment. She felt pierced by his gaze, as if he\u2019d stabbed her with the weapon he wielded with such obvious agitation.</p><p>Ani ohev otach, tzel, he\u2019d said to her dream self. I love you, shadow. But I cannot have you. You know this. Why do you tempt me? Why do you flaunt what I crave, yet am forbidden to possess?</p><p>Her sorrow over his pain had constricted her lungs and created an ache so overwhelming it roused her from a dead sleep. She\u2019d bolted awake to find tears wetting her face and pillow, and the remnants of sympathy and grief twisting in her stomach. He\u2019d been talking to her, as if she was the source of his agony, yet she couldn\u2019t imagine doing anything to elicit that devastated look on his face. She would die before she ever wounded him so deeply.</p><p>Spending the rest of the night alone in her suite at the Belladonna had felt nearly as desolate as when she\u2019d talked to Adrian on the phone four days earlier. The urge to call him again was becoming too forceful to resist. She was worried about him and missed him more than she should.</p> <p>She sucked in a sharp breath, fighting through a rush of greedy desire and feelings of possession she had no right to. She\u2019d lived her entire life struggling to find a place for herself on the outside looking in at the \u201cnormal\u201d people, but it had taken only a couple days to get irrevocably used to fitting in somewhere. Forging it alone after that acclimation was damn hard; wondering if Adrian might be feeling equally adrift was even harder.</p><p>Lindsay hit the DIAL button on her phone and lifted it to her ear.</p><p>He picked up almost instantly. \u201cLindsay\u2014is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>The knot in her stomach loosened at the sound of his warm, confident voice. \u201cI called to ask you the same question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me . . . ?\u201d His voice faded. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdrian? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m still getting used to being asked that question. It\u2019s been a rough couple of days, but it\u2019ll soon be over.\u201d</p><p>Her heart faltered a beat. He was so collected and smooth, so pulled together and in command of himself and others; she could see how easy it would be to assume he was always all right. Whom did he lean on when his burdens wearied him? With Phineas gone, did he have anyone?</p><p>He\u2019d given her an outlet for her private self. If she could return the favor, if he trusted her enough to do so, she\u2019d consider it an honor. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound happy about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone I care about is hurting, and I will have to inflict more pain on her before all is said and done.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy dug its claws into her, a response so alien and unwelcome it unsettled her deeply. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wish there was something I could do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust hearing your voice and knowing that you\u2019re thinking of me is enough.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay felt a fierce rush of pride that she might continue to be a source of comfort for him, despite everything that stood between them. \u201cI dreamt about you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d His voice took on a seductive smoothness. \u201cWill you tell me about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to leave you alone. To stop tempting you.\u201d Sighing heavily, she slumped over the table. \u201cAnd some horrible part of me didn\u2019t care that I was hurting you by making you want me. I was almost giddy over your anguish. It made me feel powerful to have such a hold on you. I wanted you\u2014whatever the cost.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled slowly. \u201cThe dream disturbed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight it did! I hate that I would think that way for even a moment. I don\u2019t feel that way. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay.\u201d He paused. \u201cI know you don\u2019t. It was just a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means that somewhere in my subconscious that thought exists.\u201d She shoved a hand through her curls. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be that person, Adrian. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, but look at me. I can\u2019t even go a few days without calling you, even though I know we need to keep a professional distance between us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are not that person.\u201d The gruff note of vehemence in his tone took her aback. \u201cJust as I\u2019m not the Adrian you dreamt of. If anything, the roles in your dream were reversed. You\u2019re asking me to let you walk away, and I won\u2019t. I know you want me, and I\u2019ll exploit your desire to the fullest\u2014I want you that badly. With every day that passes, with every conversation we have, I want you more. It burns in me, Lindsay. I ache for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian\u2014\u201d Her eyes closed on a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry we met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re only sorry that there are risks involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should run while I can.\u201d She\u2019d moved so far away from her dad for the same reason, because she knew it was too dangerous for him to be around her. She would never forgive herself if something happened to him because of her hunting, just as she\u2019d never forgive herself if Adrian paid a price for being with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d find you,\u201d he said darkly. \u201cWherever you\u2019d go, however you\u2019d hide . . . I would find you.\u201d</p><p>A knock came to the adjoining door, yanking her rudely back into the here and now. \u201cI should let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, neshama. Stay out of trouble until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries there. You\u2019re all the trouble I can handle right now.\u201d</p><p>She hung up, then called out, \u201cCome in, El.\u201d</p><p>Elijah entered. His hair was still damp from a shower and slicked back from his forehead. He was dressed in his usual loose jeans and T-shirt, and his gaze raked the room as it always did whenever he entered one. The man was a warrior through and through.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d she asked, even though she knew the answer already. The guy ate like a . . . wolf.</p><p>\u201cStarved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we please not have room service again? I need to get out of this hotel. It can\u2019t be that dangerous to hit up the Denny\u2019s around the corner, can it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . .\u201d He glanced out the window at the cloudless, sunny day. \u201cAll right. Bring your bag of tricks.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay stood. \u201cI know it sucks for you to be stuck with me, but I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She adored Elijah, despite the fact that he was a constant reminder of Adrian and the life she could have shared with the angel, if only they were friends and not crazy with desire for so much more. After losing her mother, she couldn\u2019t bear to lose anyone else she loved, and with her hunting, her life was too dangerous to pledge to someone else. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to anyone. But Adrian was special. He shared the life she did, and she resented that she couldn\u2019t even try to have a relationship with him. After all the times she\u2019d wished for someone who could know and understand why she hunted, she\u2019d finally found him\u2014only to discover they could never be together. Even the wind seemed to mourn that injustice, howling softly every time she stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cThis is a good place for me to be,\u201d Elijah said, rolling his shoulders back as if the muscles were too tight.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bored out of your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I need to keep a low profile now.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cBecause of me? Because I took off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He exhaled audibly. \u201cI used to be a member of the Navajo Lake pack. Then I was sent to Adrian for observation. Right now, the less I\u2019m observed, the more likely it\u2019ll be that they forget I was any trouble at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t peg you for the troublemaker type.\u201d He was too stoic, too honorable. He took his commitments seriously, as evidenced by the fact that he\u2019d jumped on a plane to come after her in spite of being terrified of flying.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm . . . Let\u2019s head someplace to eat, and you can tell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up for the food, not for the talking.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a wry look. \u201cAfter nearly a week in my company, you still haven\u2019t figured me out yet?\u201d</p><p>Elijah gave a long suffering sigh and gestured toward the door. \u201cIt was worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay managed to let Elijah mow his way through two full stacks of pancakes and six over-easy eggs, before she pressed him for more information. \u201cSo why do people think you\u2019re a troublemaker?\u201d</p><p>He dropped a pat of butter onto his hash browns. \u201cI said I was being observed, not that I\u2019m a troublemaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d She pushed aside the remnants of her breakfast. \u201cWhat are you being observed for?\u201d</p><p>He shoveled a massive forkful of potatoes into his mouth. After he chewed and swallowed, he said, \u201cThere are some who think I show Alpha traits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlpha. Like top dog? King of the hill? Master of all he surveys?\u201d She nodded. \u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>He paused with another heaping forkful suspended halfway between his plate and his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She leaned back into the booth. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? Better than being a Beta male for sure. I mean, they have their uses and all. But really, women are looking for sexy, hunky Alpha males. We like that take-charge, take-no-shit, bad-boy vibe. It really does a number on us, which I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed in the course of your seventy-some-odd years of living.\u201d</p><p>Elijah exhaled in a way that conveyed endless patience. \u201cWomen aside,\u201d he said drily, \u201cit\u2019s not good to show Alpha traits when you\u2019re a lycan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment, as if debating what to say or whether he should say it at all. \u201cThe Sentinels are supposed to be the only Alphas. The lycans are supposed to look to them for guidance, not to each other.\u201d</p><p>The gravity in his voice sobered her. Lindsay waited until their waitress had topped off her coffee and moved on to another table, then asked, \u201cWhat happens if it\u2019s decided that you\u2019re an Alpha lycan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be separated from the others and . . . I don\u2019t know. Alphas don\u2019t come around very often, so I don\u2019t know what happens to them. I\u2019ve heard rumors that they\u2019re kept together and used for non\u2013field assignments, like interrogations, but frankly I don\u2019t see how that would work. You can\u2019t put a bunch of Alphas together and expect them to play nice. But maybe that\u2019s the point\u2014make us kill each other, so the Sentinels don\u2019t get their hands dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe Adrian would condone that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter working with him, I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s fully aware of how the lycan system is run.\u201d He grabbed the top half of an English muffin and eyed the amount of butter already on it. \u201cHe\u2019s out there in the trenches, more so than any other Sentinel I\u2019ve seen. He\u2019s always on a hunt. He hadn\u2019t been home in almost two weeks when you saw us in Phoenix. We\u2019d taken out a rogue minion just a few hours before we ran across you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been away from home for days now.\u201d</p><p>Elijah opened two jelly packets and scraped the contents onto his muffin. \u201cYeah. Hunting is what he lives for. It\u2019s his way.\u201d</p><p>She blew out her breath. It was her way, too. The only way she knew. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ll think this is crazy, but . . . what about going into business with me? Bounty hunting maybe? Private investigations? You\u2019d still be hunting. Plus, I\u2019ve got a score to settle that I could really use your help with. We both know I need someone to be the level-headed voice of reason.\u201d</p><p>He paused in the act of chewing, staring at her, then washed down his food with half a glass of orange juice. \u201cYou think I can just quit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019d have to quit my job, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way out of working for the Sentinels is death.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s pulse stuttered. \u201cWhat are you saying? You\u2019re prisoners? Slaves?\u201d</p><p>He resumed eating. After he swallowed, he said, \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna bring another lycan on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, ignore the big question. I\u2019ll worm it out of you eventually. As for another lycan, do whatever you think is best. I trust you. I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s a woman . . . ? I\u2019d feel a lot better about you having to babysit me if you had some fun doing it.\u201d</p><p>His green eyes sparkled with laughter.</p><p>Realizing how that sounded, she groaned. \u201cThat came out wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a woman. Just someone who could use a little time away, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he an Alpha?\u201d</p><p>Elijah shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s not. Thank god.\u201d</p><p>More than anything he\u2019d said, it was the relief in his voice that gave Lindsay chills.</p><p>Adrian exited Yellowstone into Gardiner, Montana, just after dusk. He\u2019d located Helena and Mark early in the morning, then held Damien and Jason back until nightfall, giving the two lovers one last day together.</p><p>It was a concession the Sentinels obeyed without question but couldn\u2019t understand. Love in the mortal sense was unknown to them. They didn\u2019t grasp the desperate desire, the aching longing, or the purity of joy a mortal felt in finding the other half of his or her soul.</p><p>Adrian knew those extremes far too well, but this time with Lindsay was novel in many ways. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her, couldn\u2019t stop comparing her incarnation to the ones that had come before. He was used to starting from scratch, but there were always certain constants he\u2019d come to expect. Lindsay deviated from the pattern to such a degree that he could find few markers with which to map their interactions. It was all new and uncharted. And he was captivated by the mercurial emotions she roused in him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, Captain?\u201d Damien asked as they entered the small town on foot.</p><p>\u201cArrangements have been made for the lycan to join the Hokkaid\u014d pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think you should put him down,\u201d Jason said. \u201cIf ever there was a time to make an example out of a lycan, this is it. When this gets out\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adrian cut him off with a look. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to get out.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d tracked Helena\u2019s other lycan guard first, catching up to her halfway to Cedar City en route to the Navajo Lake pack. Her destination showed the strength of her self-preservation instincts. Given the opportunity to flee while the Sentinels were distracted by Helena\u2019s desertion, she chose to head to the nearest pack instead. Without hesitation, she had agreed to never speak of Mark and Helena again for the rest of her life. For her loyalty and common sense, Adrian had offered her reassignment to his pack, a promotion she\u2019d readily accepted. He had learned long ago that positive reinforcement was a far better motivator than fear and intimidation.</p><p>\u201cOnce Mark is in Japan and Helena is Anaheim,\u201d he continued quietly, \u201cwe\u2019re all going to forget the last four days. None of us wants to deal with what will happen otherwise.\u201d</p><p>A Sentinel and lycan affair. The two running away together. The consequences of that choice. All of it would be a ticking time bomb, giving ammunition to the malcontents. With the recent spate of vampire attacks and the infection he\u2019d witnessed in Arizona and Utah, he couldn\u2019t risk unrest among the Sentinel ranks now. The balance he\u2019d preserved for so long was crumbling around him. If he lost control of the Sentinels, nothing would save the world from the chaos that would ensue.</p> <p>Because of the pressing need for secrecy, he\u2019d conducted the entire hunt thus far without any technological help, unable to risk leaving a trail by using Mitchell Aeronautics resources. Being able to track Helena\u2019s rental car via GPS would have shortened the hunt, but he hadn\u2019t been in a hurry. Affording her a few days of whatever happiness she could find while on the run was such a small concession, and it was the only one he could make. The longer she was AWOL, the more volatile the situation became.</p><p>\u201cYou and Helena can\u2019t be the only ones to form attachments,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Everything seemed to be coming to a head at once. Or maybe it felt that way because he was still reeling from Lindsay\u2019s decision to leave him. She was being selfless for him. He had to try to be the same for her, which might mean letting her go.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Jason went on. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on this mission forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only surprised it took this long.\u201d Adrian looked at Damien, who lifted both shoulders in an offhand shrug that neither confirmed nor denied whether his opinion aligned. \u201cBut what are the alternatives? Dereliction of duty? The forfeiture of our wings? Preying on the mortals we were created to protect? Who the fuck wants to live that life?\u201d</p> <p>Damien exhaled harshly. \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask the Fallen about that.\u201d</p><p>They walked through Gardiner, then beyond to the rental cabins where Helena was holed up. Adrian had shadowed her and her lycan by air during the night, following them along the winding back roads and small towns they\u2019d traveled through until they\u2019d stopped near dawn.</p><p>Reaching into his pocket, he wrapped his hand around his cell phone. He wished he could talk with Lindsay now. Her mortal heart might not understand why he would part two lovers, but that heart would know it killed him to do so. She wouldn\u2019t see his sympathy and compassion as weaknesses. Even if she argued against the actions he was forced to take, it would soothe him just to hear her voice and unvarnished reasoning, strengthening him for the pain he was about to inflict on a friend he loved.</p><p>When his phone vibrated with an incoming call, his grip tightened on it in surprise. He slowed his stride, wondering if Lindsay had actually felt compelled to call him by the force of his desire for her to do so.</p><p>The caller ID told him it was the Point. He answered.</p><p>\u201cWe might have a problem,\u201d Oliver said without preamble.</p> <p>Adrian stopped. Oliver never labeled anything a problem unless it was very much a problem. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just talked to Aaron. He went to Louisiana on the hunt for a rogue we\u2019ve been tracking. They were ambushed by Vash and two of her captains. Aaron was wounded enough to put him out of commission for a while. He has no idea what happened to his lycans while he was regenerating. He\u2019s been searching for them for three days.\u201d</p><p>Looking at Jason and Damien, who could easily hear what was being discussed, Adrian saw the despair he felt reflected on their faces. Too much. Too fast. Like dominoes, everything was toppling in rapid, unstoppable succession.</p><p>\u201cYou sent a team to retrieve him?\u201d Adrian asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. But after Phineas and the attack on you, I thought you should know it was the lycans Vash was after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible they\u2019re the ones responsible for Charron\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of that. Too young, the both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me posted.\u201d Ending the call, Adrian started forward again, spurred by the driving need to get back home, where he could regroup and take the offensive. He could only hope that compiling all the information he\u2019d obtained over the last week would lead to an understanding of what the fuck was going on and why everything had gone to shit in a matter of days. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done,\u201d he said to Jason and Damien.</p> <p>As they neared the cabin, he freed his wings. The metallic odor that teased his nostrils was instantly recognizable. No light shined from the unit, intensifying Adrian\u2019s foreboding. He raced the final distance to the door, disengaging the lock with a thought before he reached for the knob. The stench of congealing blood hit him with enough force to rock him backward a step. He willed the lights on, even though he didn\u2019t require illumination to see.</p><p>With a curse, he averted his gaze from the carnage that was more horrifying under the harsh glare of flickering fluorescent lighting.</p><p>Jason stepped into the cabin and froze. \u201cFuck me,\u201d he gasped, before pivoting and stumbling out the door.</p><p>Damien entered next. His sharp inhale betrayed his shock and dismay, but he remained at Adrian\u2019s side, his gaze darting around the room as he took in the entirety of the grisly tableau before them.</p><p>Knowing he needed to provide strength to the two Sentinels, Adrian scrubbed both hands over his face and rolled his shoulders back. He turned his head forward again, breathing through his mouth. The sight of a wing lying on the floor blurred, then cleared as tears coursed down his face. The other wings were scattered about the room as if they\u2019d been tossed away like so much trash. One hung off the end of the bed, the soft pink and gray feathers now stained with blood. They\u2019d been clawed from Helena\u2019s back, leaving two rows of three stumps protruding from her graceful spine.</p><p>The fallen Sentinel lay prone on the bed, her sightless eyes trained at the door, her golden hair plastered to her cheeks and back with dried sweat and blood. Her lycan lay sprawled on the floor at the foot of the bed. Two unsealed punctures in his neck explained the sickeningly white pallor of his skin. Adrian doubted there was a drop of blood left in Mark\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cThis is hell,\u201d he said gruffly, shaken to his soul by the waste\u2014the wrongness\u2014of it all.</p><p>Damien looked at him. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it have? She wasn\u2019t punished. Her wings were taken by her lycan lover, not a Sentinel. He was bitten by a\u2014\u201d Adrian walked over to Helena\u2019s body and peeled back her upper lip. He stared for a long moment. \u201cHer canines aren\u2019t elongated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they retracted when she didn\u2019t fall completely.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s gaze lifted skyward, corrosive grief burning through his veins. His fingers sifted through the once glorious strands of Helena\u2019s hair. She\u2019d been more than a friend. She had been proof that failure was not inevitable, that it was possible, if they were strong enough, to serve their mission without forfeiting their faith in the process. Now that hope was lost, withering in an agonizing death along with a seraph whose heart had been so pure that only love could destroy it.</p><p>For the first time, he thought perhaps the Sentinels hadn\u2019t been tested so much as served as test subjects to answer the question: Was the Watchers\u2019 fall unavoidable?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Captain,\u201d Jason said, remaining on the porch. \u201cThis can never get out.\u201d</p><p>Damien ran a shaking hand through his dark hair. \u201cWe need to clean this place.\u201d</p><p>His hands fisting at his sides, Adrian continued to survey the damage. More than two lives had been lost here. A seraph had willingly mutilated herself in an attempt to fall. Then she\u2019d tried to turn her lycan. If they\u2019d succeeded, they would both be vampires now\u2014a new class of vampire. And they would have opened the door to others to try the same. The mere knowledge of what they\u2019d done held immeasurable power.</p><p>\u201cSomething went wrong here,\u201d Adrian thought aloud. \u201cMaybe ingesting lycan blood affected her fall. Maybe he could have Changed if she\u2019d fed him her blood sooner. Maybe there was no way for them to succeed. We can\u2019t know unless it\u2019s tried again. Perhaps again and again. Whatever possibilities this desperate act might inspire in others must die here, with them.\u201d</p><p>Although he spoke as if it could be contained, Adrian knew the idea would merely lie dormant for a time, waiting for another fertile mind to conceive of it.</p><p>He knew, because the idea had once been his, long ago.</p><p>And not so long ago.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here in Anaheim.\u201d Torque shielded his eyes against the headlights of a car pulling into the parking spot in front of his ground-floor motel room. \u201cBut Adrian\u2019s been gone almost a month, barring a one-night visit over a week ago when he was seen out with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be Shadoe then,\u201d Syre said with a sigh of regret.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that for certain. She has a lycan guard. If she leaves the hotel for any reason\u2014which is rare\u2014he\u2019s with her. It\u2019s possible that Adrian just doesn\u2019t want to put her at risk while he\u2019s hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving her with one guard? Away from the Point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working for Raguel and living on his property. She doesn\u2019t need a lot of protection when she\u2019s under the wing of an archangel.\u201d</p><p>Syre exhaled harshly.</p><p>Torque frowned at the sound, hearing a wealth of disquiet and frustration in it. Not what he would have expected from his father while discussing Shadoe\u2019s possible reincarnation. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember what Adrian said about Nikki? About her appearance and behavior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d forget fucking lies like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorque . . .\u201d Another weighted pause. \u201cI\u2019ve received two reports of similar sightings. These came from within our own ranks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSightings of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisease. Infection. You haven\u2019t heard anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But the cabal here is successful because of its discretion. They keep to themselves and stay focused on watching Angels\u2019 Point.\u201d Torque\u2019s spymaster cabals, known as the kage, were comprised of his most trusted minions, those who took orders without question and deeply respected that he was the son of Syre. \u201cWhat kind of infection are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnreasoned aggression, mindless thirst. Adrian\u2019s description of foaming at the mouth and bloodshot eyes has been corroborated.\u201d</p><p>Torque sank onto the edge of the bed, his heartbeat quickening. \u201cNikki was only gone two days . . .\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s worn, comfortable desk chair creaked over the cell phone receiver. \u201cIf it\u2019s not possible for you to definitively establish the woman\u2019s identity by the end of the week, I want you to come home. Depending on how widespread this sickness is, we could be looking at an imminent war with the Sentinels. We need to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>A young family of tourists walked by Torque\u2019s window, laughing and chattering with little regard for the lateness of the hour. He turned his head away from the simple happiness he would never know and looked at the clock on the nightstand. \u201cI think it\u2019s even more important that I find out who this woman is. Think about it, Dad. What if Adrian\u2019s behind everything that\u2019s happening? What if he\u2019s deliberately staging these attacks to give him the excuse to come after you? It would make sense if the blonde is Shadoe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blonde?\u201d</p><p>The pain in his father\u2019s voice iced Torque\u2019s blood. If the woman was his sister, they were as far from looking like twins as could be. \u201cYeah. And I\u2019m dying my hair now to get the blond out. How ironic is that? I\u2019ve got a job interview with her tomorrow and we\u2019ll see what happens. That\u2019s why I asked you to overnight the Fallen blood to me. I have to head out in daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it arrive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVashti should be there shortly, if you need more. I\u2019ll be waiting to hear reports from both of you.\u201d</p><p>Torque was tired of waiting. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch as soon as I can. In the meantime, think about the possibility of Adrian orchestrating these attacks and the illness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t go to the extent of killing Phineas. They were as close as brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone will sacrifice a lot, Dad, if they\u2019re desperate enough. It can\u2019t be a coincidence that Vash is tracking Nikki\u2019s abductor right back to the Point. While you\u2019re investigating the reports of sick minions, see if you don\u2019t also hear reports of vamp abductions.\u201d Torque scrubbed a hand over his face, feeling weary and irritated by the chemical stench of hair dye. \u201cI think what you\u2019re hearing are carefully planted rumors, but if there\u2019s any truth to them and Adrian is involved, he has to be abducting vamps to infect. And if so, someone out there is missing those who\u2019ve been abducted. Like I\u2019m missing Nikki.\u201d</p><p>Missing her so badly it was eating him alive. Inside, it felt like he was screaming at the world through soundproof glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll look into it, son.

She had fifteen minutes until her next interview. Although she knew she shouldn\u2019t, she wanted to call Adrian. The phone call she\u2019d just ended\u2014the one to the bladesmith who fashioned her custom throwing knives\u2014made her want to hear Adrian\u2019s voice. She spent a moment spinning her phone around and around on her desk; then it rang. When she saw Adrian\u2019s name on the caller ID, she snatched it lightning quick.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she answered, too fast. \u201cI must have thought you up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLindsay.\u201d He exhaled harshly. \u201cI needed to hear your voice.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded instantly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. I . . . I lost a Sentinel last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d She sagged back into her desk chair, knowing how seriously he took his commitment to his mission and his Sentinels. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Do you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did it to herself. I put her in a position where she felt like taking a fatal risk was her only option to being happy, and she paid with her life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe had a choice,\u201d Lindsay argued. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault she picked the option she did.\u201d</p><p>He breathed softly into the phone. \u201cDo you believe in leading by example?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I have some culpability. And truthfully, I envy her strength of will. I\u2019ve faced the choice she did. I didn\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014have the courage to do what she did.\u201d</p><p>The steadiness of his voice was more alarming than if he\u2019d been noticeably upset. \u201cShe\u2019s dead. That\u2019s not courage; that\u2019s nuts. You need to come home. You\u2019ve been away too long, and you\u2019re tired. You need a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p> <p>Her free hand curled around the arm of her chair. She couldn\u2019t help wanting to be the friend he needed. Just as she couldn\u2019t stop wanting to talk to him about her new job, her weapons, her day\u2014anything and everything. Because he got her. And she was pretty sure he felt that way about her in return. \u201cYou know where I am.\u201d</p><p>He said good-bye and she hung up, her heart heavy with worry.</p><p>The dreams she had about him each night kept her connected to him. She felt almost as if she was seeing him every day, as if they hadn\u2019t been apart since she\u2019d left Vegas.</p><p>The night before she\u2019d dreamt of them making love in a horse-drawn carriage. They\u2019d been in costume. Something historical, like she\u2019d seen in movie adaptations of Jane Austen stories. She\u2019d climbed onto his lap, pulling up yards of skirts and underskirts while he unbuttoned a pair of breeches. As she\u2019d enveloped his rigid length within her, he cupped her face in his hands and kissed her, disheveling her upswept hairdo and freeing strands of long dark hair. Gripping her hips, he\u2019d thrust upward with barely restrained ferocity, driving her toward orgasm with single-minded determination. His eyes had glowed with that preternatural blue flame as he grated, \u201cAni ohev otach, tzel.\u201d</p><p>I love you, shadow.</p><p>Lindsay was frightened by her understanding of a language she shouldn\u2019t know. She was confused by both the vast differences in each dream\u2014exotic locations and an endless spectrum of clothing from all time periods\u2014and the repetitious similarities. Adrian was always with her. He was always in love with her, and she was always insatiable. Their time together was always marred by a pervasive sense of desperation and her greedy determination to conquer him no matter the cost. She was always a woman who loved Adrian with a dangerous disregard for the consequences, yet she was never the same woman. Her appearance, her culture, her language and background\u2014it was all mutable.</p><p>Lindsay straightened, taking a deep breath to clear her mind. She was growing more scattered as the days passed. More restless and unable to concentrate. She needed to resume hunting. Until she made peace with her past, there would be no peace for her in the present.</p><p>The phone on her desk beeped a notice that her next interviewee had arrived. A moment later, a handsome young Asian man appeared on the other side of her clear glass office door.</p> <p>She gestured him in with a smile.</p><p>He entered with a quick and confident stride. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Lindsay stood, shooting a quick glance at his application to read his name. Kent Magnus. She liked the sound of it. As they shook hands, she felt herself responding to him immediately and surprisingly\u2014he wasn\u2019t human, but he wasn\u2019t making her hair stand on end either. He was dressed in a loose pair of khaki Dickies pants and a short-sleeved black dress shirt. His smile was wide and charming, and when they shook hands, his grip was dry and strong.</p><p>Good or bad, she couldn\u2019t tell, because she was hit with the overpowering feeling that she\u2019d met and talked to Kent before. \u201cHave a seat, Mr. Magus. Please.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to sit before he did. \u201cThe Belladonna is impressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d A fact that made Lindsay\u2019s discontent only more annoying. Her job was a fabulous, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and she wasn\u2019t appreciating it the way she should be. \u201cYou\u2019re applying for the night auditor position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to say, you\u2019re overqualified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping the position has room for advancement . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay gripped her armrests. The especially strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu his presence evoked made the room tilt. The previous address he\u2019d listed on his application was Virginia, a state she\u2019d driven through many times. It was possible she\u2019d crossed paths with him at a gas station or diner at some point. She blinked through the black spots dancing before her eyes, then made a concerted effort to get her brain firing on all cylinders.</p><p>Kent wore his hair cut short. Like hers, it was the same length all around. He also had a great build, with broad shoulders and thick biceps, but he wasn\u2019t as big as a lycan. She made a mental note to have Elijah classify him for her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely room for advancement,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI noticed you\u2019re new to the area. I confess I\u2019m worried about whether you\u2019ll decide to stay or not. The West Coast is very different from the East Coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you traveled to the East Coast often?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just moved from North Carolina.\u201d Unable to shake off her wooziness, she stood. \u201cWould you care for some water?\u201d</p><p>He stood when she did, displaying the etiquette she expected in men but had found sadly lacking in most of the applicants she\u2019d seen over the last two days. \u201cNo, thank you. So you and I were practically neighbors.\u201d</p><p>Pulling a bottle of water out of the minifridge in the bookcase behind her desk, Lindsay was relieved to feel less disoriented after standing. She took a long drink and noted his wedding band. An inhuman who was married. That threw her for a loop. \u201cThe hours are from eleven p.m. until seven a.m., and the days are Tuesday through Saturday. Will that be a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m a night owl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife, too?\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to pry, but she also didn\u2019t want to train a night auditor only to lose him a short time later.</p><p>All charm and humor left his face. His beautiful amber eyes revealed a deep sadness. \u201cMy wife recently passed away.\u201d</p><p>His application said he was twenty-six. Far too young to have suffered such a loss. Then again, maybe he was thousands of years old like Adrian. Or even several decades like Elijah. \u201cI\u2019m very sorry.\u201d</p><p>He gave a short nod. \u201cI want a fresh start, in a new place, with a new job that keeps me busy at night. If you hire me, I promise you won\u2019t be sorry.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay sucked in a deep breath, feeling sympathy for Kent Magus, regardless of whatever kind of being he was. She knew how hard the nights were when dealing with the loss of a loved one. It was easy to stay busy during the day, but nighttime was when one closed ranks with family and settled into private routines\u2014dinner, favorite television shows, before-bed rituals. His confidence and quiet dignity were two traits she very much admired, and his earnestness suggested that he gave a hundred percent to everything he set his mind to. She also acknowledged the possibility that she liked him because he was something \u201cother\u201d yet had loved and lost and grieved, just like she did. Just like Adrian did. Her angel had shown her that not every preternatural creature was bad.</p><p>\u201cHow soon can you start?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Kent\u2019s smile returned. \u201cWhenever you say. I\u2019m ready when you are, Ms. Gibson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>The minute Lindsay spotted Elijah waiting for her in the Belladonna\u2019s expansive lobby, she knew something was wrong. It was visible in the set of his shoulders and the grim line of his mouth. And he was pacing\u2014prowling, actually, like an agitated panther. Scratch that\u2014like a wolf.</p><p>Her heart sank into her stomach. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Is it Adrian?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his hands going to his hips. A low growl rumbled up from his chest. \u201cRemember that friend I told you about? The one I wanted to have reassigned to partner with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went on a hunt in Louisiana right before we left for Utah. I just found out he was missing until this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d Lindsay crossed her arms tightly, knowing Adrian was taking hits left and right, and suffering for them.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s half dead, I\u2019m told. And he\u2019s asking for me.\u201d His verdant gaze was sharp as he looked at her. \u201cI need you to stay put. Don\u2019t leave the hotel until I get back or someone else comes to watch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go with you, El. I don\u2019t want you going alone, and I know you don\u2019t want to leave me here. If you do, you\u2019ll be worried about me and your friend at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask you,\u201d he said gruffly. \u201cMicah\u2019s at Angels\u2019 Point.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing quickened as she remembered the morning Adrian had taken her flying over the hills around his home. Her body responded to the memories as if she was experiencing them all over again. The wind had been happy that day, whistling with a joy she so rarely felt in it. Or maybe the joy had been hers.</p><p>Abruptly, the fragrance of the massive floral arrangements decorating the lobby became cloying. The soaring ceiling seemed to close in on her. Everything about the hotel felt entrapping. She didn\u2019t fit in here. As much as she was trying and giving it her best shot, she was still\u2014and would always be\u2014a misfit in the \u201cnormal\u201d world.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she assured him, as much for herself as for him. \u201cIf you need another reason to take me, I\u2019ll remind you that I need to get my suitcase anyway. It\u2019s a good time for me to get that done.\u201d</p><p>Elijah nodded. \u201cDo you want to change or need to grab anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes to both.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were climbing into her powder blue Prius hybrid, which had been delivered by the car transport service just the day before. Elijah sucked up all the space in the vehicle, even with the passenger seat shoved back as far as it could go. She felt bad about cramping him, but she liked her car. She\u2019d told Adrian she had no aspirations of saving the world, but she did try to not pollute it or drain its natural resources.</p><p>They hit the road. Elijah was a great side-seat driver, telling her where to turn in time for her to maneuver across lanes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twitchy,\u201d he noted when she rubbed her damp palm against her jeans\u2014again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about all the bad stuff that\u2019s been happening since I met you and Adrian. It\u2019s a lot more than usual, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re always busy, but it\u2019s definitely getting more intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d She exhaled in a rush. \u201cI\u2019m sick over Adrian. He\u2019s lost too many of his friends lately and he\u2019s not getting a chance to grieve properly with everything falling apart at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMortals don\u2019t mate so quickly.\u201d</p><p>She shot him an arch glance. \u201cNot sure where that came from, but I have to disagree. Haven\u2019t you ever heard of a one-night stand? Some mortals mate within minutes of meeting each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot mate as in fuck,\u201d he corrected drily. \u201cMate as in take a bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take a bullet for you. And while you\u2019re very hot, I don\u2019t want to mate with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nuts, you know that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cAnd you\u2019re my friend. So what does that make you?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her profile for a long time, then finally turned his head to look out the passenger window.</p><p>As they climbed the hill toward Angels\u2019 Point, Lindsay\u2019s cell phone rang. She pulled it out of the cup holder where she\u2019d dropped it and answered, fumbling to hit the SPEAKER button. \u201cDad. How the heck are ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing you. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hanging in there. Hiring staff for the grand opening and trying to stay out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Adrian?\u201d</p><p>Recalling the weariness she\u2019d heard in Adrian\u2019s voice, she sighed and said, \u201cHe\u2019s having a rough time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re still sticking with him. That\u2019s hopeful. It must be serious between you two.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at Elijah, Lindsay spoke the truth because she knew both men had her best interests at heart. \u201cActually, I kinda put on the brakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Unlike Adrian, Eddie Gibson revealed every emotion in his voice. The undertone of disappointment was unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re . . . incompatible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say that?\u201d Now he sounded pissed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cHe wants to go for it. I just see the trouble ahead, and it\u2019s best to cool things off now, before we\u2019re invested.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re already invested, baby,\u201d he argued. \u201cOr you wouldn\u2019t be worried about trouble ahead.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed. \u201cHmm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been keeping guys at arm\u2019s length your whole life. I was happy about that when you were younger, and later on I figured if your dates were worth anything, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy to cut them off. But shutting Adrian out isn\u2019t easy, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, can you please not psychoanalyze me? Or at least save it until you\u2019ve tried dating again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I called. I\u2019m taking someone out to dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s hands tightened on the steering wheel. For a moment, she couldn\u2019t decide what she was feeling. It wasn\u2019t all good. She was surprised and scared, dismayed and hurt, happy and excited.</p><p>\u201cLindsay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad.\u201d Her voice was too husky. She cleared her throat. \u201cWho\u2019s the lucky lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA new customer who came in today. She asked me out after I changed her oil.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like her already. She\u2019s obviously smart and has great taste in men.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d she fibbed. \u201cI\u2019d be mad if you didn\u2019t go. You better have a good time, too. And wear the shirt and slacks I got you for your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Got it: Go. Have fun. And don\u2019t dress like a bum. But you have to do something for me, too\u2014give Adrian a shot. A real one.\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d her dad said in his no-nonsense voice. \u201cAdrian Mitchell is a big boy. He can take care of himself. If he doesn\u2019t see a problem, don\u2019t make one. You deserve to be happy, Linds, and no relationship is risk-free. I\u2019m dipping my toes in the dating waters again. But you\u2014you\u2019ve never jumped in at all. I think it\u2019s time you took the plunge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Daddy, but the metaphors are killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I love you, too, baby. Be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll want a rundown tomorrow,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cAs if I kiss and tell. Talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>Hitting the END button, she looked at Elijah, who met her gaze. Her dad was finally putting himself out there. She thought she\u2019d be happy about that. She was\u2014mostly. But there was a part of her\u2014an admittedly childish part of her\u2014that felt as if her dad was leaving her mom behind. Which was something Lindsay still couldn\u2019t do.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re close to your sire,\u201d Elijah noted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all the other one has, if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he said, \u201cExplains why Adrian has lycans guarding him.\u201d</p> <p>Her foot lifted from the gas pedal. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian assigned lycans to watch your father. I didn\u2019t know why. Now I do. He\u2019s doing it for you, because your sire is important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did he set that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Vegas.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay pushed harder on the gas, thinking it would be better not to be behind the wheel at the moment. \u201cWhy would my dad need guards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone important to Adrian is at risk of being used against him.\u201d</p><p>Getting to her dad would get to her, which would get to Adrian. \u201cIf something ever happened\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Elijah offered a reassuring smile. \u201cAdrian asked me to pick the team, and I suggested the best of the pack. They\u2019ll keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>She might have kissed him, if she hadn\u2019t been driving. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You should thank Adrian, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly, her heart softening further. Adrian\u2019s fall wasn\u2019t the immediate concern; it was her own fall that was imminent. \u201cI should. I will. Shit, everything\u2019s a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Which reminded her why they were driving to the Point to begin with. \u201cDo you know what happened to your friend? Why he was missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was ambushed and left for dead. It took him a couple days to make it to the highway, where he was found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she breathed. \u201cWas it vamps?\u201d</p><p>Elijah gave a curt nod and gestured for her to turn left up ahead.</p><p>\u201cFuckers. I want to kill them all.\u201d Even as Lindsay said the words, the depth of hatred in them surprised her. Her life had changed so much in the last couple of weeks. Vampires were now hurting her friends, and they were responsible for making it impossible for her to have Adrian. She couldn\u2019t think of one good reason for them to exist. They were like fleas or mosquitoes\u2014disgusting, worthless, bloodsucking parasites that were better off extinct.</p><p>She pulled up to the wrought-iron gate and gatehouse that protected the Point. The guard took one look at Elijah and let them in. It was midafternoon. The sun was still high in the sky, affording her the opportunity to check out all she\u2019d missed the first time she\u2019d driven through the elegant gate. The wolves stayed on the other side of a rise in the road, keeping themselves hidden from public view. When she crested the top, she saw them dotting the native landscape. So many of them. So majestic and imminently dangerous.</p><p>Pulling around the circular driveway, she parked. She tried to expel some of her tension with a swift, audible exhalation.</p><p>Elijah was out of the car in a controlled yet powerful rush of movement, opening her door before she had released her seatbelt. He waited until she climbed out, then pointed to a large hangarlike building set atop a hill about a half mile away. \u201cI\u2019ll be there. You can come up when you\u2019re done grabbing your things, or wait for me here. If I\u2019ll be more than an hour, I\u2019ll send word.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay caught his arm before he turned away.</p><p>He stared down at her hand, which she pulled back quickly. \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to put my scent on you. I just\u2014I\u2019m sorry about your friend, Elijah.\u201d</p><p>His gaze lifted to hers and his features softened. \u201cI know you are. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, I\u2019m here for you.\u201d She offered a commiserating smile, then headed toward the double-door entrance. She\u2019d just lifted her hand to knock when the door opened.</p><p>\u201cMs. Gibson.\u201d</p><p>A tall, sinewy redhead filled the doorway. His hair was long, hanging past his shoulders, but there was nothing effeminate about him. He brought to mind a Viking warrior of old, grim faced and resolute.</p><p>Lindsay hesitated. \u201cHi. I just need to grab my stuff; then I\u2019ll get out of your way.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a moment, assessing her in a way that suggested he found her lacking. Then he gestured her in.</p><p>She knew he was an angel. All the Sentinels had the same flame blue eyes, although only Adrian\u2019s ever gave off heat. The Sentinels were works of art, really. It was rather intimidating being surrounded by dozens of perfect, gorgeous beings.</p><p>Since the redhead declined to say anything further, Lindsay headed straight for the bedroom she\u2019d used when she\u2019d spent the night. Everything looked the way she had left it\u2014the bed was made and her toiletries were neatly arranged on the bathroom counter. When she\u2019d last walked out of the room, almost two weeks earlier, she had expected to be back that night. The loss of what she might have had if she could\u2019ve joined Adrian\u2019s world tightened her throat and made it hard to swallow.</p><p>In hindsight, the plans she\u2019d made to live in this sumptuous space, with its balcony that led to a deck where she could watch angels take flight with the sunrise, and its owner, who was the most magnificent creature on earth, seemed preposterous. But she had held the dream for a moment, and she missed it terribly.</p><p>Lindsay looked at the bed as she moved past it, remembering how she\u2019d fantasized about seducing Adrian there. Her imagination in that regard had been especially vivid, yet nowhere near as raw and searing as the real deal had turned out to be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d she muttered, fighting the fierce desire to stay\u2014forever. Fighting the aching longing to embrace the angel, his life, and the possible friends\u2014like Elijah\u2014who would understand what drove her.</p><p>Packing in record time, Lindsay grabbed the handle of her suitcase and wheeled it out of the house. She had to pass a large number of Sentinels who\u2019d crawled out of the woodwork to get a look at her. She now understood why they eyed her the way they did. She was the interloping human who was fucking with their leader\u2019s head. Despite their palpable animosity, she paused on the threshold of the open front door and faced them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rooting for you guys,\u201d she said. She wanted to ask them to take care of Adrian for her, but she didn\u2019t have the right to do so. He belonged to them, not her.</p><p>The front door shut behind her with a soft click of finality. She didn\u2019t cry; she refused. She would not feel sorry for herself for doing the right thing for Adrian. For the world, actually, which was dependent on him but didn\u2019t know it.</p><p>Popping open her trunk, she collapsed the telescoping handle of her suitcase and lifted the carry-on from the ground. The wind kicked up, swirling in a funnel that encompassed only her. She was held motionless in the churning embrace.</p><p>Stay, stay, stay, it crooned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve caused enough trouble,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>Don\u2019t go, Lindsay. Lindsay . . . Lindsay . . . The wind ceased abruptly, leaving a vacuum in which her name cracked like a whip.</p><p>\u201cLindsay.\u201d</p><p>Her head turned. Adrian stood beside the open rear door of the Maybach, which sat idling at the start of the circular part of the driveway. The wind was all over him like a lover, riffling through his dark hair, which had grown at least a half inch since she\u2019d last seen him. He looked rakish and beautiful in a black long-sleeved henley and dark blue tailored slacks. His face was serenely composed and his posture relaxed, but she sensed the raging turmoil in him. His gaze dropped to the suitcase in her hands and an icy surge of desolation washed over her, making her shiver. She\u2019d never felt such hopeless despair, such heartrending guilt and pain. His and hers.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. She could scarcely catch her breath.</p><p>God. Of all the things she had to give up, why did it have to be him? She\u2019d give up food. Chocolate. Water. Air. If it meant she could have him without restriction for any amount of time.</p><p>He shattered his stillness by lunging toward her and breaking into a dead run.</p><p>The carry-on fell from her slackened grip and hit the gravel drive. \u201cAdrian.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d barely taken a few steps when he snatched her up, tackling the breath from her lungs.</p><p>His wings burst free in an eruption of crimson-stained alabaster, and they surged into the air.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>Elijah entered the lycan barracks and was met with chilling silence weighted by the expectation of imminent death. The rows of neatly made bunk beds stretched on endlessly, the far side of the room extending away from him even as he traversed its length.</p><p>He followed the sound of a beeping heart monitor, but he knew where he was going without that guide. Micah had one of the private rooms at the end, those that were set aside for the mated pairs. The door was open and a handful of lycans, including Esther and Jonas, formed a gauntlet to the threshold.</p><p>They watched him with haunted and beseeching eyes. He looked away from their crushing expectations, hating their belief that he was some kind of messiah. Just because he held absolute control over his beast didn\u2019t mean he exerted a similar level of control over other lycans\u2019 fates and circumstances, but that\u2019s what so many hoped for and believed.</p><p>Entering the room, he found Micah in bed, stuck with multiple intravenous lines and tended to by Rachel. She stood when Elijah approached and met him partway, looking as pale and thin as her mate.</p><p>Swallowing past the tightness in his throat, Elijah asked, \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>She ran a shaking hand through her dark hair and jerked her chin in a silent gesture for him to step outside. Back in the barracks\u2019 great room, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s dying, El. It\u2019s a miracle he\u2019s even alive now.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed at his eyes with his fists, trying to rub out the sting of grief.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been waiting for you,\u201d she went on. \u201cHonestly, I think that\u2019s all he\u2019s been waiting for.\u201d</p><p>Elijah looked at her helplessly.</p><p>She swiped tears from her cheeks. \u201cHe really loves you.\u201d</p><p>Pushing past her in a desperate rush, he reentered the room and took the seat she\u2019d vacated. He scooched it closer to the bed, then reached out and gripped his friend\u2019s cold hand.</p><p>Micah\u2019s eyes slitted open. Turning his head, he met Elijah\u2019s gaze. \u201cHey,\u201d he whispered. \u201cYou made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my line.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile briefly transformed the lycan\u2019s features, but was quickly gone. \u201cHad to tell you . . . Vash\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVash did this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s looking . . . for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA vamp in Shreveport . . . missing. Your blood was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been to Shreveport.\u201d</p><p>A violent shiver racked Micah\u2019s emaciated frame. \u201cYeah, well . . . your blood was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking. Get some rest. We\u2019ll catch up later.\u201d</p><p>Micah\u2019s once clear green eyes were cloudy with pain and weariness. \u201cNo time. I\u2019m going, Alpha. This is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your back. Blood . . . It\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>Elijah looked at Rachel hovering in the doorway. She nodded grimly. His blood. At an abduction scene in a town he\u2019d never visited.</p><p>A high-pitched wheeze from the bed drew his attention back to Micah.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Elijah said gruffly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Worry about getting better.\u201d</p><p>Micah\u2019s hand tightened on Elijah\u2019s with surprising force, his claws extending enough to break the skin of his own palm and Elijah\u2019s. Blood, hot and slippery, pooled between their joined grips. \u201cListen. You\u2019re the one. Hear me? It\u2019s you. Get Rachel out . . . Get them all out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elijah jerked backward. \u201cDon\u2019t put that on me, Micah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe trusts you\u2014\u201d The redhead erupted into violent, hacking coughing that left flecks of blood on both his lips and the pristine whiteness of his sheets.</p><p>\u201cRachel will be fine. I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Rach\u2014\u201d He gasped. \u201cAdrian\u2019s woman . . . trusts you. You can abduct her . . . Leverage.\u201d</p> <p>Elijah pulled free of Micah\u2019s grip, furious and sick that his best friend would dump this shit on him now. On his fucking deathbed. \u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d he hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me this. She risked her life for me.\u201d</p><p>Micah\u2019s head lifted from the pillow, his gaze an echo of its former fierceness. \u201cAdrian will bend for her. Promise me. Step up. Make it happen. You can free them all. Only you.\u201d</p><p>Lurching to his feet, Elijah stumbled out of the room.</p><p>\u201cBlood oath, El,\u201d Micah whispered, holding up his bloodied hand. Then he deflated into the bed, his chest rattling with every labored breath.</p><p>Elijah cleared the threshold. He looked at the lycans waiting outside the room. There were more of them now. A dozen familiar faces, all looking at him with somber, unwavering expectancy.</p> <p>\u201cYou all put him up to this,\u201d he accused. \u201cYou told him where I\u2019ve been these last couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>Esther stepped forward. \u201cElijah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou selfish fucking bastards.\u201d</p><p>He looked at his hand and the already healing punctures marring it. With a roar, he shifted. Bursting free of his clothes, he vaulted forward in a powerful lunge that took him almost to the end of the building.</p><p>He rammed through the door to the outside and ran.</p><p>Lindsay was still gasping, trying to regain the breath Adrian had knocked from her, when he landed on the other side of the house. She heard the slide of a glass door at her back; then she was being carried through it and into a room containing a massive desk and a wall of overflowing bookshelves.</p> <p>Leaning back in his embrace, she looked at his face. His features were stark, the skin stretched taut with fierce determination. Another door closed behind her, this one an interior door, and she was pushed up against it, pinned by Adrian\u2019s hot, hard body. The drapes began their automated glide shut along with the sliding glass door, plunging the room into silence and darkness.</p><p>\u201cAdrian . . .\u201d</p><p>His mouth sealed over hers. He caught her wrists in his hands and pulled them above her head, one after the other. His tongue thrust into her mouth, a swift plunge that turned her on instantly.</p><p>The warm, vibrant scent of his skin filled her nostrils, wilder today than she\u2019d remembered. Sexier.</p><p>She struggled against his grip and found her wrists tied to a coat hook on the back of the door. As his hands slid down her arms, she tugged to no avail, then grasped frantically with her fingers. Feeling lace, she realized he\u2019d done that undressing thing with his thoughts and secured her to the hook with her own panties. A tentative squirm confirmed she was now commando in her jeans. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me.\u201d His voice was low and deceptively even, but the rigidness behind it was as tangible as the thong around her wrists.</p><p>Lindsay tugged again. The lace tore and immediately something stronger bound her to the door. When Adrian\u2019s hands pushed up beneath her T-shirt and cupped her bare breasts, she realized it was her bra. A shiver moved through her. The only time she\u2019d ever been held against her will was the day her mother had been killed. \u201cCut me loose, Adrian.\u201d</p><p>His mouth latched on to the side of her neck. His fingers tugged her nipples into hard tight points. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>Without volition, she arched into his hands, her breasts growing heavy and tender. \u201cYou\u2019re upset. We should t-talk. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now.\u201d He gripped her hips, making her aware that she was now completely nude. When a hair-dusted thigh pushed between her own, she realized he was naked, too.</p><p>Her breathing was loud in the otherwise quiet room. Her heart raced with a potent mixture of fear and forbidden desire. If it had been anyone else restraining her, she would\u2019ve lost it. But it was Adrian, and the feel of his hands against her skin kept the terror she might have felt at bay.</p><p>\u201cYou should think about this.\u201d She panted, attempting to wriggle away from his inflaming touch. \u201cYou don\u2019t want this. You don\u2019t want what\u2019s going to happen to you if you do this.\u201d</p><p>His cock glided between the slick lips of her sex. Lindsay froze. He was hot and hard, delectably long and thick.</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel,\u201d he purred, \u201cas if I don\u2019t want this?\u201d</p><p>She bucked when his lips wrapped around her nipple. The coat hook creaked in protest but held fast. Adrian didn\u2019t have the hollow particleboard doors that would have given her a chance to escape. The solid wood his architect had used was more than strong enough to take her weight and abuse.</p><p>He drew on her breast with long, deep pulls of his wicked mouth. Her good intentions started to melt away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid\u2014\u201d She spoke the lie, hoping it would deter him.</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re on fire with it.\u201d He parted the lips of her sex and stroked a fingertip through the silken liquid of her desire. \u201cYou\u2019re always so fearless, but you trust me enough to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>Her moan echoed through the room. She was achingly aware that the hallway must be on the other side of the door behind her, along with a dozen or more angels who disliked and distrusted her for this very reason\u2014she reduced their leader to a mere man, with all the weaknesses and lusts and desire for comfort that came with that mortal state. \u201cStop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He kissed her again. A hot, wet, lush kiss that spoke of a man who\u2019d crossed his limits at some point in the days they\u2019d been apart. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Adrian.\u201d She writhed in his grip as he captured her neglected nipple in his mouth, his tongue licking and worrying the rigid peak. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you let me save you?\u201d</p><p>He released her with a soft pop, then straightened to rub his temple against hers. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to save. It\u2019s all falling apart.\u201d</p><p>The painful emotion in his words broke her heart. She longed to pull him close and embrace him, to soothe his torment. But she couldn\u2019t move, had only her voice with which to comfort him. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d He slid down her body. His lips brushed between her cleavage; then his tongue darted into her navel. When he nuzzled between her legs, Lindsay bit her lower lip to keep from crying out. Beneath her distress at being immobilized in the dark and her worry over Adrian\u2019s volatile mood, she was ferociously aroused. In an untenable situation. She couldn\u2019t forget how exposed they were and how many people\u2014angels\u2014were nearby.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this. You\u2019ll regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regret not doing it.\u201d He held her open with his thumbs. The tip of his tongue fluttered maddeningly over her clitoris. As her sex clenched in greedy hunger, a rough noise escaped him. \u201cI should have finished what we started in Vegas. I should have ignored the damn door and fucked you until you\u2019d never even think about leaving me.\u201d</p><p>His serrated voice revealed his anguish and cut her deeply. She wanted to push her fingers into his hair and hold him close. She wanted to gentle him with soft strokes of her hands down his back. She wanted to give him the freedom to put down his burdens in total safety, away from the eyes of those who needed him to be strong all the time. But doing so would make him confront what ate at him, when what he wanted now was the oblivion he could find in her body.</p><p>Oblivion she couldn\u2019t offer him. Not at the price he would pay for it.</p><p>Adrian caught her right leg behind the knee. He lifted it over his shoulder, opening her to the sudden thrust of his tongue. Her back arched and her head hit the door, the thud reverberating through the room and surely out into the hallway as well. He either didn\u2019t hear or didn\u2019t care. His mouth was buried in the slick folds of her sex, his tongue shoved as deep into her as he could go. He worked her tender flesh with rapacious hunger, as if he could drink her in. Consume her. Brand her body with his scorching, intimate kiss. She trembled and gasped, her toes curling so tightly they began to cramp. She hung on to that twinge of pain, fighting the orgasm he was determined to force on her.</p><p>His abrupt, drawn-out groan brought tears to her eyes, the sound so lost and desolate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not t-too late,\u201d she managed through heaving breaths. Hot tears fell onto her breasts, her heart torn because she knew it was too late. They were both too far gone to turn back now. They\u2019d passed the point of no return the moment she killed the dragon in front of him. She could have walked away from the kill just that once, but she hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d bared her most personal secret within hours of meeting him, as if she\u2019d needed him to see her for who she really was.</p><p>Still, she fought the inevitable because she cared about him. Deeply. So deeply that the thought of him suffering for her made her insane. \u201cYou can stop this, Adrian. Before it goes too far.\u201d</p><p>He growled then, a deep rumbling sound of aggression and determination. He latched on to her clitoris and sucked in rapid, forceful rhythm. A steady, drawing tempo that kicked her into an explosive climax. Her perspiration-slick body was wrenched by brutal spasms of release, devastated by a scorching pleasure she couldn\u2019t defend herself against.</p><p>Turning his head, Adrian wiped his wet mouth on her inner thigh. Then he shrugged out from under her leg and stood.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you consider too late and too far?\u201d he asked with dangerous softness. \u201cI\u2019ve already been inside you. With my fingers. My tongue. My cock.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes squeezed shut and her head hung limply. She struggled to regulate her breathing, to regain some control over her own body. Even shrouded in darkness, Lindsay felt raw and exposed, seared by his blistering emotional turmoil. \u201cT-technically, yes,\u201d she managed between deep gulps of air. \u201cBut you stopped. You restrained yourself once. You can do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, you say.\u201d His hands cupped the cheeks of her ass and squeezed roughly. His teeth nipped at the upper swell of her breast, over her heart, hard enough to hurt. The tightly leashed control she associated with him was gone. He was ruthless, predatory, single-minded in his need to dominate her from the outside in. \u201cNeither of us came, so it doesn\u2019t count?\u201d</p><p>He hefted her up and yanked her legs around his hips. A heartbeat later he was penetrating her with his brutally hard erection. She shuddered and strained to accommodate him, but he took a swift step forward and drove himself in to the root.</p><p>Pinned to the door, she whimpered in exquisite agony. Although primed by a half dozen nights of tender, erotic dreams, she still needed time to adjust to his size.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, although she didn\u2019t know what she was asking for. To stop? To start? To never give up, even though she begged him to? She couldn\u2019t say yes\u2014not when she knew what he was risking. But she couldn\u2019t stem the selfish longing that wanted him to refuse to accept no for an answer. There was nowhere else she\u2019d rather be than right where she was, but her refusal wasn\u2019t about her. It was about him and what was best for him.</p><p>She heard the rustle of Adrian\u2019s wings, felt the soft breeze they created as they unfurled and moved. That telltale kiss of air betrayed the emotions he fought to hide.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moaned, a final, futile effort to save him.</p><p>One of his hands went to her hair, lifting her head so he could take her mouth. His lips slanted across hers, his lungs inhaling her every gasping exhalation. He rolled his hips and screwed deep into her, grinding with just enough pressure to stimulate her swollen, sensitized clitoris. Lindsay\u2019s body tensed in heated expectation, her greedy sex rippling along the length of his throbbing penis.</p><p>His breath caught. His irises flared bright enough to delineate the sclera of his eyes and the thickness of his lashes in the darkness. He exhaled into her lungs. \u201cNo more technicalities.\u201d</p><p>Adrian came so hard she felt it like a deep, hard thrust inside her. The violent jerking of his spending cock . . . the wash of molten liquid that caused sweat to slide between her breasts . . .</p><p>Her orgasm took her by surprise.</p><p>She shook with the unexpected surge of pleasure, her blood roaring through her ears so that she barely heard him moan her name.</p><p>The need to sob and cry out welled inside her. Lindsay caught his neck in her teeth, biting down to stem the sounds she wanted no one else to hear.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he hissed, thrusting mindlessly. \u201cFuck yes.\u201d</p><p>Her wrists were freed. Her arms fell to his shoulders, her muscles twitching and tingling from the strain of pulling for freedom.</p><p>He pivoted away from the door, carrying her unerringly in the dark\u2014still joined, still coming. He sat, and Lindsay felt cushions beneath her knees. A love seat, maybe. Or an armless chair. Her jaw unclenched, releasing his throat, and her head lifted. Behind her, a soft glow built like a light on a dimmer switch\u2014a barrister\u2019s desk lamp illuminating gradually until she could see everything in the room.</p><p>She looked upon his face, her heart thudding with joy at the sight of him. He was flushed, his eyes feverishly bright, his lips swollen from the ferocity of his kisses. But what ruined her was the moisture glistening on his lashes.</p><p>Tears. From her indomitable, implacable angel.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already too late,\u201d he said hoarsely, wiping her own tears from her cheeks with soothing strokes of his thumbs. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He kissed the marks on her wrists left by the bonds he\u2019d restrained her with. \u201cI know you wanted to protect me from this. I tried to let you, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so damn sorry I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d His head fell back. Upholstered in black suede, the love seat they occupied framed Adrian\u2019s dark splendor and offset his rich olive-toned skin. \u201cDon\u2019t apologize for caring enough to be strong when I\u2019m weak. Don\u2019t be sorry for being the one thing that makes me happy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cAs long as we can beg, borrow, and steal.

It is what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey already hated me.\u201d She dreaded leaving the room and facing all those accusing cerulean eyes. \u201cNow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey heard you say no. They can\u2019t hold this against you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay cupped his face in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m not worth all this. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just a crazy mortal who has no self-preservation instincts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m an angel who\u2019d die for you. See?

She\u2019d gotten what she wished for. And again, she regretted it. She couldn\u2019t say yes, and he wouldn\u2019t hear no. \u201cI don\u2019t belong anywhere else, you know. I\u2019ve never fit in with \u2018normal\u2019 people. I don\u2019t fit in with your people. But I fit with you. I know it. I feel it. None of that matters, though, because it\u2019s forbidden. I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m the reason you fall and lose your wings. I\u2019d rather die than see you turned into a soulless, bloodsucking vampire.\u201d</p> <p>He nuzzled his nose against hers. \u201cAni ohev otach, Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>Oh god . . . Now that she knew what that meant . . .</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d he whispered, pulling her mouth down to his and teasing the seam of her lips with the tip of his tongue. \u201cShow me you want this as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>Her hands gripped the back of the love seat.</p><p>\u201cTake me, neshama sheli,\u201d he coaxed, flexing his still hard cock inside her. Sprawled beneath her in all his gorgeous magnificence and purring an erotic invitation, he looked every inch the sinful, decadent, unabashedly wicked fallen angel. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s features lit with a glorious smile. He twisted swiftly and she found herself beneath him, filled with him.</p><p>\u201cI know what it means when you say that,\u201d he murmured, hooking his arm beneath her leg and drawing it up, opening her so completely he hit the end of her.</p> <p>Panting in exquisite torture, she managed, \u201cIt means run. Save yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of which says, \u2018I\u2019m falling for you, Adrian.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>His tongue traced leisurely along his lower lip before he caught the firm curve in his teeth. He watched her with heavy-lidded eyes, gauging her reaction as he gave a practiced roll of his hips. The thick crown of his penis rubbed against all the deliciously tender erogenous zones inside her\u2014a deliberate sensual assault.</p><p>She whimpered as he withdrew slowly, then thrust home deeply. Smooth and easy. He\u2019d taken the edge off and was now settling in for what she knew would be a long, unhurried ride. Her fingernails dug into his tapered hips. \u201cAdrian.\u201d</p><p>He bent his head and groaned into her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m falling for you, too, Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>\u201cIt has to be her.\u201d</p><p>Syre pushed aside the slender female arms crossing his chest and slid from his bed. He exhaled harshly, fighting the growing hope that so often led to disappointment. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t at first,\u201d Torque said. \u201cEven after meeting with her, I couldn\u2019t say absolutely. She\u2019s different this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a lot of ways. For one, I\u2019m pretty sure I got to her. There were a couple times when she looked at me funny, like she might know me but couldn\u2019t quite place me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but two hours after I met with her, she headed up to Angels\u2019 Point. Adrian returned shortly afterward.\u201d</p><p>Restless with excitement, Syre paced the length of his bedroom. \u201cHow will you get to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to come down into the city to go to work.\u201d There was a smile in his son\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd she hired me, so I have an excuse to be in the hotel most nights of the week. It won\u2019t be long before the perfect opportunity presents itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best opportunity we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>Syre rubbed at the ache in his chest. \u201cI should come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Torque\u2019s voice was sharp, his tone implacable. \u201cVash is here now, with Raze and Salem. I\u2019ve got all the backup I need. Your coming here will only give Adrian the opportunity to take you out. You need to stay in Raceport and out of sight as much as possible for the time being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you love Shadoe, and you want to see her again. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll be more than a couple weeks before that happens.\u201d</p><p>Syre looked out the window at the moon, a sight he\u2019d seen too many times to count. Too many times without Shadoe. Grieving parents didn\u2019t get opportunities to be reunited with the children that were lost to them, but his curse was also his blessing. He\u2019d fallen from grace for siring Torque and Shadoe. Nephalim, they were called. Angel halflings. Yet it was that specialized hybridization that had spared her soul when he\u2019d begun the Change to save her life. All of the nephalim vampires were unique in that way. Their souls survived the Change because they were as strong as an angel\u2019s, without the vulnerability of wings.</p><p>\u201cTake as long as you need, son,\u201d he said quietly, stepping farther away from the bed as one of the two women occupying it rolled to the side with a disgruntled sigh. \u201cIt does me no good to lose one child while trying to recover the other. I need both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d Torque laughed softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t reach this age by making stupid mistakes. Don\u2019t worry. Just make arrangements for Shadoe\u2019s return. Before you know it, we\u2019ll all be together again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMicah says Vash had a rag or cloth . . . some bit of material with my blood on it.\u201d</p><p>From Adrian\u2019s elevated position on the stairs leading down into the sunken living room, he studied Elijah, who looked unusually agitated. \u201cAnd she claims it came from the scene of an abduction in Shreveport?\u201d</p><p>The lycan nodded. His arms were crossed and his stance was wide, as if anchoring himself for an expected blow. \u201cThe airport there. But I was with you in Phoenix then. The vamp was snatched a couple days before the chopper crash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Jason asked from his position by the fireplace. \u201cHow would your blood end up states away from where you were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d the lycan said. \u201cIn order to have been that readily identifiable, it couldn\u2019t have been more than a month old. Prior to hitting the nest in Utah, I haven\u2019t lost enough blood on any hunt in the last thirty days to leave some behind for someone to jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me . . .\u201d Lindsay began, drawing Adrian\u2019s attention. She sat on one of the sofas, looking petite and fragile in the massive room.</p><p>She\u2019d been silent since she emerged from his bedroom, fresh from a shower and smelling like his soap and shampoo. Neither did anything to disguise the scent of sex with him, which was skin deep. Still, she\u2019d been so embarrassed by the thought of everyone being able to smell his lust on her that he\u2019d tried to comfort her the only way he could think of\u2014he\u2019d told her it would make perfect sense to smell like him if she used his toiletries.</p><p>\u201cYes, neshama?\u201d he coaxed. Power was thrumming through him, his soul recharged by its growing attachment to hers. Added to the more primitive rush he felt from having made love to her for hours, he felt ready to take on anything. The Sentinels thought his love for a mortal made him weak, when the opposite was true. Lindsay gave him strength in ways he couldn\u2019t explain to anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure figuring out how is important,\u201d she began. \u201cBut I\u2019m curious as to why. Why would anyone want to set up Elijah? What do they get out of it?\u201d</p><p>She looked at the lycan and offered him a brief, supportive smile. She seemed to have a fondness for him, which made Adrian determined to keep the beast close and safe for her sake. Whatever stability and grounding he could offer her in their present tenuous circumstances, he would.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not him in particular,\u201d Jason suggested. \u201cMaybe any lycan would have served the purpose. Anything they do reflects on Adrian.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twisted thoughtfully. \u201cSo someone sets it up to look like the vamp was snatched by Adrian . . . ? Why is that news? That\u2019s what he does. It\u2019s what you all do, lycans and angels alike.\u201d</p><p>Adrian relished an inner smile, pleased with her participation and clever mind. She enhanced him. Lindsay was a warrior, just like he was. Just as Shadoe had been. But Lindsay was cerebral about it, analytical, while Shadoe had used her sexuality as a weapon.</p><p>\u201cVash wouldn\u2019t retaliate for just anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cDid she say who was abducted?\u201d</p><p>A shadow passed over Elijah\u2019s face. \u201cNo name. Just that the vamp was a woman. A pilot and a friend of Vash\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA female pilot.\u201d Adrian looked at Jason, wondering if his second was reaching the same conclusion he was.</p><p>Jason whistled. \u201cCan\u2019t say for sure, Captain. I didn\u2019t get a good look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was diseased and unrecognizable. Sick like the vamp we caught in Hurricane.\u201d</p><p>Aaron entered the room. The recently returned Sentinel had already made his desire for retribution clear. In addition to Micah\u2019s deteriorating health, he\u2019d lost his other lycan guard in Vash\u2019s attack. \u201cVash had Salem and Raze with her. They hit us in full daylight.\u201d</p><p>Three Fallen on the hunt together. Not unheard of, but rare. They didn\u2019t have many occasions to exert that much force at once.</p><p>Adrian remembered his conversation with Syre. Nikki had one of the kindest hearts among us . . .</p><p>Shit. He looked at Damien, who stood behind the sofa Lindsay was occupying. \u201cTorque\u2019s wife. Nicole, right?\u201d</p><p>The Sentinel nodded. \u201cThat sounds right. And she\u2019s a former Army pilot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Torque?\u201d Lindsay asked, her gaze darting from one face to another.</p><p>Your brother. Your twin.</p><p>Adrian looked at Jason, whose brows were raised in a look that asked, How much are you going to tell her?</p><p>Elijah replied. \u201cSyre\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Syre is . . . ?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cThe leader of the vampires,\u201d Adrian said, with an evenness that belied the twisting of his gut. She wasn\u2019t ready to hear everything yet. He would prefer that she never hear it. If the Creator was kind, Adrian would succeed in killing Syre. Then Lindsay would be freed from Shadoe\u2019s naphil gifts, Shadoe\u2019s soul would be freed from purgatory, and Adrian would be recalled for disobeying the standing order to keep the Fallen alive. It was the closest he could come to rectifying his mistake.</p><p>\u201cThe Watcher whose fall got you those crimson tips on your wings?\u201d Lindsay asked.</p><p>He gave a brisk nod.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Before we move on . . . What\u2019s up with the superhero names? Syre, Torque, Vash, Raze . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the Fallen gave up their angelic names when they fell. Syre was once known as Samyaza. Raze was once Ertael. As vampires, they have a proliferation of legal names they switch out every now and then as time passes, so they\u2019ve established a culture in which there\u2019s almost a competition for the most outrageous handles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-kay . . . To be clear,Vash\u2014an important vampire\u2014is involved because the gal who was abducted was important, because she\u2019s related by marriage to the leader of the vampires. Am I following so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they just call you and ask what the ransom terms are? It\u2019s not like they can\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t believe you\u2019re innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed her. I told Syre that.\u201d Adrian met her gaze unflinchingly, knowing she would understand such a brutal admission of murder.</p><p>Lindsay blinked in surprise. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>He descended into the living room. \u201cWhen did I tell him? In Phoenix. In the airport, right after I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Vash knows this isn\u2019t a rescue mission. She\u2019s out for blood in retaliation for a death. She managed to corner Aaron and his two lycans. But instead of holding Aaron for ransom or targeting him because he\u2019s higher up the food chain than the lycans, she lets him go. I\u2019m confused as to why a vamp who usually only hunts big fish would toss the biggest fish back.\u201d She looked at Elijah. \u201cNo offense to your friend.\u201d</p><p>The lycan met her gaze. \u201cNone taken.\u201d</p><p>Jason crossed his arms. \u201cKilling a Sentinel would escalate the situation beyond what Syre would condone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis son\u2019s wife is dead, thanks to Adrian, but he balks at taking out one of the Sentinels?\u201d</p><p>Damien looked at Adrian. \u201cGo on, Lindsay. This is getting interesting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lindsay twisted on the sofa, bringing him more fully into the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s going on here. The vampire head honcho\u2019s daughter-in-law gets nabbed by Elijah. Allegedly,\u201d she qualified when Elijah opened his mouth. \u201cVamp dude calls Adrian to ask for her return and Adrian says he killed her. Yet Vash remains focused on the lycan involved and not the Sentinels. How come?\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s wings unfurled. \u201cI accused Syre of sending Nikki to attack me. He didn\u2019t respond to the accusation as I would\u2019ve expected, nor to my mention of Phineas, which led to me wondering whether he was losing control of his vamps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible that he thinks you\u2019re losing control of the lycans? I mean, the reverse is true. You probably didn\u2019t respond the way he expected. He called you because he was worried about his daughter-in-law, and you didn\u2019t even know who she was. You didn\u2019t recognize her. But the lycans who took her knew her identity\u2014assuming she wasn\u2019t sick then. He\u2019s got to be thinking that the lycans made a pretty bold move taking someone so valuable to him without you knowing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d Jason said, looking at Adrian.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you all going with this?\u201d Aaron asked.</p><p>Jason\u2019s brow arched. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the lycans are working on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Lindsay interjected, shooting a glance at Elijah, who gave nothing away on his face, \u201cwhy implicate one of their own by leaving Elijah\u2019s blood at the scene?\u201d</p><p>Aaron exhaled harshly. \u201cWhich resulted in the death of Luke\u2014my other lycan\u2014on sight. There was no attempt made to capture or speak to him. And Micah is as good as dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey captured him, then let him go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey left him for dead,\u201d Aaron said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there?\u201d she challenged. \u201cThe whole leaving-someone-for-dead business is beyond me. Either something is dead or it\u2019s not, and if it isn\u2019t and you want it dead, you don\u2019t leave it to chance. Why would Vash\u2014?\u201d</p><p>A silence fell over the room as Lindsay abruptly stopped speaking. All eyes rested on her until she shrugged blithely and said, \u201cNever mind. Too complicated for me. My brain hurts.\u201d</p><p>She stood and walked toward the windows, stepping through when one large pane of glass slid automatically to the side.</p><p>Resisting the urge to flex his wings, Adrian dismissed Jason and Aaron with an accompanying order to report to his office in the morning. He feigned nonchalance, but inside he was weighing the myriad possible reasons for why Elijah\u2014the first Alpha to make an appearance in many years\u2014had been set up to take the fall for Nikki\u2019s abduction. He knew Lindsay\u2019s mind had followed the same train of thought and she\u2019d ceased her speculations the moment she realized how dangerous they were to Elijah.</p><p>Adrian studied the lycan as the living room cleared, noting how Elijah followed Lindsay as far as the window, guarding her still, yet making a pointed effort to stay within boundaries that wouldn\u2019t incite Adrian\u2019s fierce possessiveness. The lycan and Lindsay clearly had a friendship of sorts, which was why Adrian entrusted him with her protection, but that didn\u2019t mitigate the danger Elijah presented as an Alpha. Whether he had any culpability in the abduction or not, it appeared someone had gone to great lengths to bring the Alpha lycan to the attention of the vampires, and the vamps were taking the steps necessary to formalize that introduction.</p> <p>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</p><p>Collusion between the lycans and vampires would lead to the annihilation of the Sentinels. The numbers against them would be far too great to withstand.</p><p>Gauging Elijah\u2019s loyalty was more important than ever. Adrian expected that fidelity would be strongest with other lycans, but it just might be strong enough with Lindsay to make defection difficult.</p><p>Elijah met his gaze as he moved to follow Lindsay outside.</p><p>Adrian paused on the threshold. \u201cWhat do you think, Elijah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVash was empty-handed after speaking to Micah. She was left with the choice of interrogating another lycan before my blood sample deteriorated or following Micah back to me. I think that\u2019s why she let him live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do should she come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEviscerate the bitch.\u201d He growled, his eyes glowing with green fire. \u201cMicah is my friend. He\u2019s like a brother to me, as Phineas was to you. And she killed him. I could\u2019ve lived with that if she\u2019d fought him for it. But to die like this, sick and broken in a bed\u2014no lycan should have to die like that.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian set his hand on Elijah\u2019s shoulder and swiftly searched the lycan\u2019s mind. A red haze of fury and grief washed over every sifting thought, none of which dealt with mutiny or treachery. Momentarily reassured, Adrian murmured, \u201cMay we all go down fighting.\u201d</p><p>He released the lycan and stepped outside, finding Lindsay standing a safe distance away from the railing while staring at the cityscape in the distance. He embraced her from behind, wrapping her within his arms and wings.</p><p>\u201cYour participation helped immensely,\u201d he said with his lips to her ear. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate that you\u2019re dealing with so much crap at once.\u201d She leaned into him, placing her arms over his. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had any time to grieve. And my being here is just making things worse.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s arms tightened around her. \u201cYour being here makes things bearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a glutton for punishment,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHe\u2019s loyal to you, you know. Elijah. And he\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily make him less dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does being an Alpha mean? What makes him different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beast within the lycans is powerful. They were created with demon blood\u2014the blood of werewolves\u2014 and it\u2019s very much like being possessed. They have two natures warring inside them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI can guess how that must be for them. I feel like I\u2019m warring with myself sometimes. Especially with you. I know what I need to do, but it\u2019s hard to shut out the voice in my head that says, To hell with the consequences.\u201d</p><p>Shutting his eyes against her inadvertently accurate confession, he went on, \u201cAt times, the beast takes over. The lycan can\u2019t control the need to shift or the violence that comes with it. The Alphas are different. They have the power to decide which half of their nature is most dominant, regardless of triggers or provocation, and that power seems to extend outside of themselves. They can calm and subdue the beasts in the lycans around them. The others are drawn to that force of will, and their beasts subjugate willingly to the Alpha, but their allegiance must be with the Sentinels first and foremost.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back into the crook of his shoulder, her silky golden curls brushing across his jaw. \u201cWhat do you do with the Alphas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe segregate them from the others and use them for assignments in which a lone hunter is required. The other lycans must work in teams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho oversees that for you? Or do you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dispatching of the Alphas is delegated to Reese. I can introduce you, if you like. He can answer your questions more thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she tilted her head to the side. Her soft lips whispered against his chin. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you carry the weight of everything you\u2019re responsible for, but I respect you for doing what has to be the most difficult job ever.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d noticed in Utah that Lindsay refrained from contradicting him in front of an audience, showing him respect and displaying a restraint that was unique to her. Although she was as strong willed and passionate as Shadoe, she was far less impetuous when it came to weighing the ramifications of her words and actions. She maneuvered well through group interactions, but in a way that minimized her presence and participation. While Shadoe had always been the most vibrant individual in any gathering, Lindsay could recede from notice when she chose to. It was a defensive tactic she must have cultivated to deal with her feelings of abnormality. Who would notice she was strange if they didn\u2019t notice her at all?</p><p>Adrian admired her ability to be circumspect, which made him ever more determined to protect her from further experiences that might erode her confidence. Lindsay Gibson was an extraordinary woman in so many ways. He never wanted her to question her worth for a moment.</p><p>Yet he\u2019d put her in a position of being surrounded by those who distrusted and resented her. When he took himself out of the equation and thought only of her, he knew what had to be done. The sooner he killed Syre, the sooner she would be free of Shadoe\u2019s soul and this life of war that wasn\u2019t meant for her. But with every hour that passed, he fell a little farther and the thought of losing her gnawed a little deeper.</p><p>He knew he must have dreaded losing her with such ferocity before, but he was damned if he could remember when.</p><p>Lindsay sank into the chaise in Adrian\u2019s bedroom and stretched out. His personal space was surprisingly spartan compared to the bedroom that had been given to her. No art adorned the walls, and the furniture was Shaker in style.</p><p>This, she thought, was more like him. Although he appeared at home surrounded by the trappings of massive wealth, it was in this room that he fit best. As she surveyed the space, the affinity she felt for him deepened. She knew how it felt to wear a guise all the time. It was exhausting and wore away at a person after a while.</p><p>Adrian was busy unpacking his bags. It didn\u2019t escape her notice that he did it the old-fashioned way\u2014with his two hands. Busywork hinted at agitation. Or avoidance.</p><p>Tucking her hands behind her head, she stared up at the ceiling. It was something she and her father had often done over the years\u2014had lain on their backs and looked up at the sky, feeling the wind move over them as it whispered softly. Eddie Gibson never doubted that Lindsay heard voices in the air, even though he couldn\u2019t hear them himself. She was so grateful to him for that unconditional love. It enabled her to love others who were extraordinary, like Adrian.</p><p>\u201cThank you, by the way,\u201d she said, \u201cfor looking out for my dad. I know you need every hand right now, but I won\u2019t talk you out of watching his back. He\u2019s my rock. I couldn\u2019t get by without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed absently at the ache of homesickness in her chest. \u201cYou\u2019re being quiet. A penny for your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about the questions you brought up earlier.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cYou\u2019re quiet, too. What are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad, which led to me thinking about the lycans guarding him. I\u2019m trying to wrap my mind around you enforcing this you-work-for-me-or-die rule. I can\u2019t see it in you. Commander of military forces, yes. An employer, yes. Even an angel\u2014no problem. But someone who forces people to do things against their will under threat of death? No.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled audibly. Although his facial expression didn\u2019t change, she sensed disquiet in him.</p><p>\u201cAre they slaves?\u201d She looked at him again. \u201cAdrian?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d paused with his hands in his duffel bag, frowning. \u201cI\u2019ve always used the word \u2018indentured.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a form of servitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t abuse them. I make every attempt to see to their comfort. I try, in all ways, to be fair to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they can\u2019t quit? Or leave?\u201d</p><p>His chest lifted and fell on a deep breath. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah . . . I see a problem there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut neither can the Sentinels. Or the vampires. We\u2019re all trapped in our roles, which were established eons ago. This push and pull between us\u2014it\u2019s bigger than all of us. The brutal fact of the matter is, if the lycans don\u2019t help me keep things together, there won\u2019t be a world to be free in.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay pushed her hair back from her forehead. \u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying. But I still don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you do. I don\u2019t think you have it in you to like it, which is why I wonder how you\u2019ve done it for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a soldier, Linds. I\u2019m given orders and I follow them. It\u2019s all I can do.\u201d</p><p>There was something in the softness of his tone that made him seem so alone. As alone as she\u2019d often felt over the years. She held her hand out to him. \u201cI\u2019d like for you to tell me what happened over the last week.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the room to her. Not here, he mouthed, catching her fingers with his own. He pulled her up, then tugged her out onto the wraparound deck.</p><p>Stepping into his arms, she said, \u201cWait a minute before you take off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now, but I will be in a minute.\u201d She smiled, knowing there was nowhere else she\u2019d rather be than with Adrian. All the restlessness that had been vibrating within her for the last week\u2014and most of her life before that\u2014was gone, replaced by a languidness that came from more than great sex. It came from him alone. He centered her. \u201cI just love the way your body feels against mine when you\u2019re exerting yourself. And since this is pretty much the only guilt-free way to have you doing that, I want to make sure I enjoy every minute.\u201d</p><p>His hands slid to her hips and urged her against him. \u201cAnytime you want me to exert myself against you, just ask.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay wrapped herself around him from shoulder to ankle. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her with eyes that were hot with desire and soft with affection. \u201cYes. I know, neshama. Ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>His wings snapped open and he leaped over the low railing. They caught air and soared over the darkened hills with the wind singing softly. In the near distance, the lights of the city twinkled like a blanket of multicolored stars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flight was over too quickly. Adrian landed a few miles away, directly in front of a metal-sided building that sat unlit on a barren plateau.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked breathlessly, her heartbeat still wild from exhilaration.</p><p>\u201cOne of the training camps. If you like, you\u2019ll be enduring it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and the fluorescent lights flickered on automatically, revealing a large warehouse-type room with a half dozen bunk beds, two sofas, and walls covered in every weapon she knew of as well as several she\u2019d never seen. It was like a giant man-cave great room, homicidal-style.</p> <p>\u201cWhy,\u201d she queried, \u201cdo lycans and Sentinels, who have such awesome natural defense mechanisms, need any of these things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the vamps use them. We need to know how to fend off attacks made with these weapons and to improvise, if any of them should fall into our hands.\u201d</p><p>Admiring a blade that looked somewhat like a scythe, Lindsay looked over her shoulder at him. \u201cI\u2019m worried about how the other Sentinels will deal with me training with them.\u201d</p><p>Adrian stood nearby, watching her with heated pride. \u201cLet me worry about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause problems for you, Adrian. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m doing. I hate that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI woke this morning praying for the end to come quickly. Now I have you, and the end is the last thing I want.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay couldn\u2019t stop the tear that ran down her cheek. She could be strong about a lot of things, but Adrian\u2019s tenderness had been devastating her from the beginning. He made her feel as if she was precious to him. It killed her that he would try to give her all of himself, but she would still have only a portion. There was nothing she could do about that except offer him what comfort she could, and refrain from asking for anything in return. \u201cTalk to me. Tell me why you were ready to give up.\u201d</p><p>His wings flexed restlessly. The pearlescent backdrop showcased his dark beauty to breathtaking effect.</p><p>After her mother had died, she\u2019d been so angry. She had railed at the entity other people believed in, the God others claimed was so generous and loving. She\u2019d found little in life to redeem her lost faith in a benevolent higher power, but Adrian\u2019s existence softened that skepticism. If the same being who\u2019d allowed her mother to be brutally murdered was also responsible for creating Adrian, then there was something magical and praiseworthy in the world, even if none of it was ever shared willingly with her.</p><p>\u201cThe Sentinel I lost was a friend,\u201d he said softly, inadvertently wounding her with his pain. \u201cBut more than that, she was a pristine example of what a seraph should be. She was pure of spirit and purpose, focused solely on our mission.\u201d</p><p>She moved toward him, reaching for his hand and clasping it in her own. So much death. He\u2019d dealt with too much of it. \u201cAnother vamp attack?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat would have been kinder than the reality.\u201d</p><p>She stepped closer and he embraced her, settling his chin atop the crown of her head. Her connection to him in that moment rocked her. In a remote hillside warehouse, surrounded by implements of destruction and the arms of an angel, she felt at peace in a way she never had before. \u201cYou said you\u2019d have to hurt someone you cared about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe fell in love,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWith a lycan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Lycans aren\u2019t mortals.\u201d</p><p>He barked a humorless, bitter laugh. \u201cHelena said the same thing, but seraphim aren\u2019t designed to experience mortal love. We\u2019re not supposed to have mates. She wanted my blessing. She hoped I would give it to her, because I have you. But it\u2019s not my place to make that decision. It\u2019s my responsibility to keep the Sentinels on the right path.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay felt the progress she\u2019d recently made in regard to having some faith backslide again. How could love, in any form, be wrong? \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p> <p>As he explained the actions Helena had taken, Lindsay\u2019s blood chilled and goose bumps spread across her skin. She relived the horror and agony of that night with him, her shoulders sagging under the growing weight of his despair. There was no greater proof of the impossibility of loving Adrian than the suicide of Helena and her beloved lycan.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she whispered when he was done. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d His chest expanded with a deep inhalation. \u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped, then lurched into a double-time rhythm. She pulled back and glared up at him.</p><p>\u201cI swear to you\u2014\u201d Her voice cracked, forcing her to clear her throat before continuing. \u201cIf you ever try something like that, I\u2019ll make you regret it.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed to her forehead. \u201cYou worry too much about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d Her fingers dug into his waist. \u201cWhatever consequences we face for being together is out of our hands. We don\u2019t need to borrow trouble on top of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we won\u2019t.\u201d For a moment, he looked so resolute and somber, giving her the impression there was something more he needed to say. Instead he said, \u201cWe should head back. You have an early day tomorrow, and I have to look into how Elijah\u2019s blood ended up in Louisiana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any guesses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe take and store blood from each lycan for identification and genetic purposes. If any of Elijah\u2019s stored blood is missing, I have a traitor in my ranks. The alternative would be that someone collected his blood from a hunt at some point in the past and saved it, which would speak to lengthy premeditation. There\u2019s really no good way to look at this. Someone out there has an ulterior motive that can only cause me a lot of trouble.\u201d His thumb brushed over her cheekbone. \u201cI know how you feel about the lycans, and I don\u2019t disagree, but there\u2019s no way one hundred and sixty-one Sentinels can contain the thousands of vampires in the world without their help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me help you, brainstorm with you. I want to support you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, neshama. I look forward to it.\u201d He urged her toward the door. \u201cBut first, you need to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d She preceded him out of the building. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept well since Vegas, and it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>His mouth lifted in a half smile that charmed her. \u201cYour definition of a long day may change after training tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay looked at him through the lock of hair the evening wind blew across her cheek. \u201cYou can\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>He turned off the lights and stepped outside with her. The wind kissed him, too, whispering across his wings. \u201cYou\u2019re fearless. That\u2019s one of the many reasons I want you.\u201d</p><p>A quiver of sexual awareness moved through her, heating her blood.</p><p>When they got back to the house, she didn\u2019t go inside, knowing it was best not to confront temptation directly. \u201cI\u2019m going to head back to the hotel. Is my stuff still out front?\u201d</p><p>Adrian paused on the threshold of the sliding glass door leading back into his bedroom. \u201cI want you to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good idea. Besides,\u201d she rushed on, when his eyes took on the glitter of determination, \u201cI need to give two weeks\u2019 notice, and the sooner I do that, the better.\u201d</p><p>He weighed that a moment. \u201cOnce you quit, you\u2019ll stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her.</p><p>She knew what would happen if he touched her. \u201cCan we talk about it later? I\u2019m beat.\u201d</p><p>After a brief hesitation, he nodded. \u201cTomorrow. Leave your suitcase here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014no idea what it did to me to see you putting that in your car.\u201d Catching her hand, he stroked his thumb over the back of it. \u201cLeave it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She squeezed his fingers, a faint echo of the constriction around her heart.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t say the words, but she could show him. That would have to be enough for both of them.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>\u201cI knew they were going to have a hard time with this,\u201d Lindsay muttered to Elijah, watching as more and more Sentinels began to land in the field by the training warehouse.</p><p>The sun had just risen. Adrian had insisted Elijah drive Lindsay back to the hotel the night before, arguing that she was too tired to be behind the wheel. Since her Prius was a bit small for a large lycan, they\u2019d taken one of the Point\u2019s Jeeps. She thought leaving her car behind might have been another way for Adrian to keep something of hers with him, something she\u2019d have to come back for, so she\u2019d refrained from arguing.</p><p>\u201cThings have been the same for the Sentinels for a long time,\u201d Elijah said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably been a while since anything threw them a curveball.\u201d</p><p>She pivoted to face him. \u201cAre you going to be all right, El? With the whole Alpha business and now the blood thing yesterday . . . Is there something I can do?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her. With his green eyes hidden behind dark sunglasses, she couldn\u2019t get a read on what he might be thinking. \u201cJust stick close to me. I\u2019m supposed to keep you safe. If I fuck that up, I\u2019m toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine you fucking anything up.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p><p>\u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even want to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>Damien approached. While the morning was chilly and fog hugged the ground, he was dressed like the other Sentinels on the field: in loose pants and leather sandals. The women wore sports bras, but otherwise everyone sported bare torsos. Just looking at them made Lindsay shiver. She was wearing a lined jogging suit, but she was still just short of having chattering teeth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you with knives and a shotgun.\u201d The Sentinel raked her with a clinical glance. \u201cYou were fairly skilled with both. How are you in hand-to-hand combat?\u201d</p><p>Her brow lifted. \u201cSeriously? I\u2019m human. That\u2019s what the knives and guns are for, to keep the inhumans from getting close enough to tear me to shreds. Plus knife throwing and marksmanship are solitary activities, so I taught myself\u2014Whoa!\u201d</p><p>Lindsay arched back and away from Damien\u2019s fist flying toward her face. The smack of flesh meeting flesh rent the air. She hit the dirt on her ass and stared up with wide eyes.</p><p>Elijah had blocked Damien\u2019s blow with the palm of his hand. The two men were in a standoff, their arms shaking with the force each exerted in a brutal sort of strong-arm competition.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>The two men pushed away from each other, each taking a step back. They turned to her in unison, both extending a hand to help her up. She grabbed them both and let them haul her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cAdrian said you were quick,\u201d Damien said calmly, as if he hadn\u2019t just struck out at her with a blow that would have shattered bone. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to see you move in Hurricane, so I had to gauge your speed.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay gaped at him, then shot a look at Elijah. A muscle was ticcing in the lycan\u2019s jaw. Maybe the test hadn\u2019t been just for her. Maybe they\u2019d been testing him as well.</p><p>The rest of the Sentinels, about ten evenly divided between men and women, dotted the field around them, sizing her up. She felt like a raw slab of meat tossed to voracious raptors.</p><p>She rolled her shoulders back.</p><p>\u201cIf you get me squared away,\u201d she said to Damien, \u201cAdrian will worry less about me and more about the shit you\u2019re dealing with. We all want that.\u201d</p><p>The Sentinel held still for a moment, staring her down. She didn\u2019t flinch.</p><p>Finally, he nodded. They might all want a pound of her flesh, but Damien would keep them focused on the big picture. Hopefully.</p><p>Elijah stepped closer to her. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he promised, in a way that sounded like a threat. A gauntlet thrown down for the others.</p><p>Damien gestured for her to join the Sentinels on the field. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She realized Adrian hadn\u2019t been kidding about revising her definition of a long day. This one was going to be endless, she knew. And it hadn\u2019t even started yet.</p><p>\u201cElijah\u2019s blood is missing from Navajo Lake.\u201d</p><p>Adrian looked away from the view speeding by the Maybach\u2019s rear passenger window and faced his lieutenant. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jason returned his cell phone to his pocket. \u201cNot the whole sample, just some of it. They had to weigh the bag to detect it.\u201d</p><p>The sun glinted off the Sentinel\u2019s golden hair through the panoramic glass roof, creating a halo effect. For a moment, homesickness was a deep ache in Adrian\u2019s chest.</p><p>The longest they could store blood before the cryo-preservation affected the quality of the sample was ten years. Someone had accessed the blood, removed what they needed, and returned the sample.</p><p>\u201cWhen we reach the airfield,\u201d Adrian said, \u201cI want you to head to Navajo Lake and find the one responsible. Only Sentinels are authorized to access the cryogenic storage facility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019s one of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter Helena . . . who can be certain? I need to know for sure.\u201d</p><p>Jason sighed. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d have any sympathy for what Syre and the Watchers did. But it seems like the longer we\u2019re here, the more human we become. We want things . . . feel things . . . Well, you know.\u201d</p><p>Adrian studied his second for a long moment, looking at Jason with a thoroughness he hadn\u2019t employed for quite some time. He\u2019d stopped paying attention to a lot of things, it seemed. Too lost to the apathy fostered by his grief and guilt.</p><p>\u201cDo you desire, Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to the extent you do and not for sex. My restlessness stems from frustration. I\u2019m tired of carrying a yoke that can never be put down.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI would ease your disquiet, if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well.\u201d Jason lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll live. And I have hope that this vamp illness signals the end of our mission. God willing, it will take them all out and we\u2019ll be able to go home.\u201d</p><p>Adrian looked back out the window.</p><p>Home. For him, that was now wherever Lindsay was.</p> <p>They reached Ontario and the hangar Mitchell Aeronautics kept there. They waited briefly as the massive metal doors parted; then they drove the Maybach inside. Jason set off to make flight arrangements for his trip to Utah. Adrian moved deeper into the building, heading down into the subterranean storage areas. The farther he descended, the easier it was to hear the growls and hissing. Unintelligible sounds mingled with shouted threats and profanities from those captives who hadn\u2019t yet been infected.</p><p>It felt very much like entering the bowels of hell.</p><p>\u201cCaptain.\u201d</p><p>A petite brunette approached him with a clipped, precise stride. Dressed in urban camouflage and sporting a pixielike cropped hairstyle, Siobh\u00e1n looked too delicate to be formidable, which helped her immeasurably in battle. Her opponents always underestimated her. It was one of the reasons he\u2019d put her in charge of rounding up infected vampires. The other reason was her fascination with science. This hunt had required someone who understood that capturing the vamps was only the beginning.</p><p>With gloved hands, she pulled down the surgical mask covering her face. \u201cWe\u2019ve already lost two of the six I caught. Four is a very small pool of subjects, so I\u2019ll need to hunt again soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo any of the noninfected have useful information about when the illness was first sighted? Or how it might be spread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne was willing to talk.\u201d She dug into the cargo pockets of her pants and withdrew a mask and gloves, which she handed to him.</p><p>\u201cAre these necessary?\u201d Sentinels were impervious to disease.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She gestured for him to walk with her, leading him to a room filled with a dozen silver-plated cages. \u201cBut you don\u2019t want their spittle on you, just for the ick factor.\u201d</p><p>He donned the protection without further questions. \u201cWhat do we know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe disease first appeared about a week ago. It infects at a varying rate. Some succumb swiftly and die within a matter of days. Others take longer to show symptoms and live up to two weeks. This group wasn\u2019t aware that there are other incidents of infection in other states, which makes me wonder how much Syre actually knows.\u201d</p> <p>Adrian walked by the cages, examining the infected vamps with morbid fascination. Red-eyed and frothing at the mouth, they seemed mindless. They bashed themselves against the unforgiving metal bars and reached out with clawed fingers, grasping for Adrian and Siobh\u00e1n with malevolent desperation. Their gazes were wild, yet lifeless. \u201cDo they show any signs of intelligence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re like bad B-movie zombies. Aside from a fierce thirst for blood, there seem to be no lights on and no one home.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled harshly. \u201cAre we testing their blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took samples from both the infected and noninfected while they were still tranquilized on the plane. However . . .\u201d</p><p>Her pause caught his attention and he tore his gaze away from the macabre freak show to look at her. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms. \u201cTheir metabolisms are extremely accelerated. While the noninfected vamps stayed under induced anesthesia for the duration of the flight, the sick ones woke up shortly after we took off. Malachai was bitten by one of them while drawing blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, he\u2019s fine. But I have him quarantined until I know for sure. The vamp that bit him was the first of the two causalities. I had to put him down to get him off Malachai.\u201d</p> <p>Siobh\u00e1n resumed walking, stopping before a cage in which a male vampire sat in the corner with his arms wrapped around his drawn-up knees. \u201cThis is the talkative one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the great Adrian,\u201d the vamp said, his voice shaking. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so scary with that mask on. You look scared.\u201d</p><p>Crouching, Adrian asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does to me.\u201d</p><p>The vamp lifted a shaking hand to push back a grimy lock of dark hair that had fallen over his brow. \u201cSinge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you like to burn?\u201d Adrian asked, recognizing the signs of withdrawal and knowing that the monikers vampires chose often had significance.</p><p>\u201cCrystal dream.\u201d</p><p>Looking at Siobh\u00e1n, Adrian asked, \u201cAny possibility the drug is connected? Perhaps it affords a level of immunity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything is a possibility at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for your help, Singe.\u201d Adrian stood and faced Siobh\u00e1n. \u201cTake me to Malachai.\u201d</p><p>They left the room and moved down the hall.</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you,\u201d Adrian said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Captain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay Gibson mentioned that her blood has a negative effect against some of the beings she\u2019s hunted. Since she\u2019s taken down both vampires and demons alike, I assume it\u2019s the latter group that was susceptible.\u201d He thought of the vampress he\u2019d interrogated in Hurricane. He\u2019d had Lindsay\u2019s blood on his hands, but it didn\u2019t spark a reaction of any kind, adverse or otherwise. \u201cCan you explain why her blood would allow a blade to slice into a dragon\u2019s impenetrable hide?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cInteresting. I\u2019d have to think about it. I\u2019d certainly love to test a sample.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible that having two souls inside her would be the cause?\u201d</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n slowed before a metal door with a window. \u201cYes, it\u2019s possible. You know how powerful souls are. Two in one vessel likely creates a unique force we will probably never fully understand.\u201d</p><p>Looking through the glass, Adrian saw Malachai kicking back on a cot with his cell phone in hand. Adrian knocked. Malachai looked up, his face breaking out in a smile when he recognized his visitor.</p><p>\u201cI feel fine, Captain,\u201d the Sentinel shouted.</p><p>\u201cGood to hear.\u201d Adrian was about to say more when a ferocious pounding came from down the hall. He looked over his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>A few more Sentinels appeared in the hallway as the violent thumping continued. They all looked to Adrian, who swiftly passed them en route to the source of the sound.</p><p>As the location of the noise became apparent, Siobh\u00e1n said, \u201cThat\u2019s the makeshift morgue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAside from the corpses of the two infected vamps? No one.\u201d</p><p>The sound of glass shattering preceded a shout. \u201cLet me out of here!\u201d</p><p>They turned a corner into a short hallway that ended with a single door. A masculine face stared out through the broken window, amber eyes glowing with ire. \u201cFuck you, Sentinels,\u201d the man growled. \u201cEither kill me or let me go. Don\u2019t fucking leave me in here with a rotting corpse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a corpse,\u201d Siobh\u00e1n whispered. \u201cI shot him myself after he bit Malachai.\u201d</p><p>Adrian didn\u2019t take his eyes off the vamp in front of him. \u201cHe\u2019s made a miraculous recovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the other one is still dead . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is the one I caught. Turned into an oil slick, I was told.\u201d He contemplated the seemingly cured vampire with narrowed eyes, the tempo of his heartbeat accelerating as he considered the possibilities.</p><p>\u201cOne of these things is not like the others,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThe only difference being . . . what? The ingestion of Sentinel blood?\u201d</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n made a choked noise. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, deep shit.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d Elijah asked as he watched Lindsay exit her adjoining bedroom.</p><p>He sat at the small desk in his suite, working on his laptop and trying not to feel like everything was closing in on him. That was pretty damn difficult, considering the wariness with which the Sentinels were watching him and the expectation that weighted the gaze of every lycan he crossed paths with. Everyone was waiting for him to make a move, one that would rip apart the well-oiled system that kept mortals blissfully ignorant. One side wanted to defuse his perceived power, while the other wanted him to blow up like a powder keg. He was fucked coming and going.</p><p>\u201cDude.\u201d Lindsay shook out her wet curls with her hands. \u201cDid you get that vitamin water I asked for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in your minifridge, Your Highness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood grief.\u201d She stared at him with exaggerated shock. \u201cDid you just make a joke?\u201d</p><p>He refrained from smiling. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you did.\u201d</p><p>Elijah looked back at his laptop screen. He liked her. And after the multiple times she\u2019d gone out of her way to save his sorry hide, he thought of her as a friend. He didn\u2019t have too many of those, which was why he\u2019d been speechless when she\u2019d said they were friends. Somewhere over the days he\u2019d been guarding her, he had stopped thinking of her as just a principal and started thinking of her as just Lindsay. He was more relaxed around her than he\u2019d been around anyone in a long time, because her friendship came without strings or expectations. She was crazy and fun, and blunt to a fault. She was just goofy enough to reveal that she hadn\u2019t socialized much as a kid. Like him, she probably had a very small group of people she trusted. He wondered if she\u2019d ever shared her gifts with anyone else. Shit, why did she have them in the first place? She was a great big question mark, and everyone wanted a piece of her. And it was his job to make sure no one but Adrian got any.</p><p>She reappeared a moment later, swigging from a bottle of some neon-colored liquid that boasted its nutritional content. \u201cYa know . . . I feel like I got run over by a freight train while suffering a hangover.\u201d</p><p>The Sentinels had worked her hard all morning, so hard Elijah had had to step in a couple times. They hadn\u2019t liked that, but they knew Adrian would back him up. As for Lindsay, she\u2019d put up with the brutal pace without protest, taking the occasional dirty hit and brushing it off.</p><p>The Sentinels clearly didn\u2019t understand the significance of Adrian\u2019s display of sexual dominance the day before, or they would have been more careful with her. Perhaps even Adrian didn\u2019t understand the entirety of the driving need he\u2019d felt to claim, mark, and possess her, a need aggravated by her attempt to get away. Female lycans knew better than to flee. Rousing the beast by denying him his mate wasn\u2019t the smartest idea. Elijah had once assumed it was the demon in the lycan bloodline that made them so primal with their mates, but he\u2019d been careful with Lindsay from the beginning, just in case. A smart move, if he said so himself. Now it\u2019d been proven that the angels were capable of the same possessive and wild carnality. Perhaps the angelic contribution to the lycan genetic makeup was the largest source of that near violent covetousness.</p><p>Regardless, the lycans had gotten Adrian\u2019s message loud and clear. Unfortunately, Elijah feared the awareness of Lindsay\u2019s importance to the Sentinel leader only made her more vulnerable. Those who whispered about rebellion had been looking and waiting for a chink in Adrian\u2019s inviolate power, Elijah realized, and Lindsay was it.</p><p>Fuck. He scrubbed both hands over his face. How had he missed how fanatical the others had become? How long had Micah been filling the others\u2019 heads with the pipe dream of freedom?</p><p>\u201cI can hear the wheels in your head turning,\u201d Lindsay said drily, setting her empty bottle on the dresser so housekeeping would recycle it. She was somewhat of a tree hugger, he\u2019d noticed.</p><p>He needed to be hunting down whoever had set him up, but he couldn\u2019t leave Lindsay, and there was no one he could trust with her.</p><p>She went to the closet and pulled out her messenger bag, perfectly comfortable with walking around with an arsenal slung over her hip. \u201cI need to go out.\u201d</p><p>He pushed back from the desk. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously tacky touristy Disney and California stuff. Hats, sweatshirts, shot glasses, et cetera.\u201d</p><p>His lack of excitement must have shown on his face, because she laughed.</p><p>\u201cI have to get my dad stuff he\u2019ll roll his eyes over,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut, lucky for you, we won\u2019t be gone too long. I\u2019ve got an interviewee coming in at three.\u201d</p><p>Elijah looked at the clock and noted it was one. He had to hand it to her\u2014she\u2019d taken a beating all morning and kept on ticking. \u201cDo you have plans tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get my car from the Point, but otherwise you\u2019re free to do whatever.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cGood. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Once she was settled in the hotel for the night, he could talk to Rachel by phone. He had to get some idea of how pervasive Micah\u2019s rebellion plans were. Elijah knew he had to rip that weed out by the root as soon as possible\u2014a damn near impossible task when he was away from the rest of the pack most of the time.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201d Lindsay asked him as they exited the elevator on the bottom floor. They usually took the stairs\u2014all seventeen floors\u2014but she was too wiped out to need the exercise today.</p><p>\u201cToo complicated, too time-consuming, too much work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you like girls, right? Or don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His gaze darted to hers, only to find her dark eyes laughing.</p><p>\u201cMade you look,\u201d she teased.</p><p>He snorted in lieu of laughing, but it was a close race between the two.</p><p>Lindsay stopped abruptly just outside the revolving doors leading to the awning-covered bellhop and valet area. Bellmen were going through training in front of them, while gardeners put the finishing touches on the flower bed framing the crescent-shaped driveway. Life as mortals knew it was carrying on as usual, but the sudden stiffening of Lindsay\u2019s posture and her intense focus was like a dog on point, signaling the proximity of prey nearby. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Abruptly, his senses went on alert. Elijah scanned the immediate area again, just as he\u2019d automatically done before they\u2019d exited the lobby. The uncanny wind that always seemed to follow Lindsay blew past him, carrying the blood-rich scent of vampire. The beast inside him coiled in readiness, growling softly in anticipation of his order to attack.</p><p>The vamp responsible for their instinctive reactions appeared a moment later, strolling into the parking lot from the public sidewalk, blissfully unaware of the predators she\u2019d roused.</p><p>Her looks hit him like a sledgehammer. She was tall and stacked, with curvy hips and full, firm tits. Her hair hung to her waist, straight as a board and blood red. She was clad like a goddamned dominatrix, with spiky-heeled boots, tight black pants, and a leather vest dipping in a low V that displayed the deep valley of her cleavage.</p><p>Elijah was blindsided by the insane urge to bend her over the hood of the Mercedes she was walking past, wrap her hair around his forearm, and drill her lush body until he came with a roar.</p> <p>He fucking hated vampires, especially the females, who were more vicious than the males. Yet his cock was swelling with feral lust the longer he watched her.</p><p>She jerked violently, jolting him back to reality. She spun wildly, as if felled by a blow, then rounded back with fangs bared.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he saw the glint of sunlight on something metallic embedded in her shoulder that he realized what had happened.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered, barely catching Lindsay by the shoulder as she darted forward.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, El,\u201d she snapped, yanking to be free of his unyielding grip.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d he barked. \u201cIt\u2019s goddamned daylight. That\u2019s one of the Fallen.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay sliced across his forearm with her blade, eliciting a roar of pain and garnering her release.</p><p>She was halfway to the vampire when she answered him.</p><p>\u201cThat bitch killed my mother.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>Vash stared down at the burning pain in her shoulder and realized she\u2019d been hit with a silver-plated throwing knife. Ripping the blade free, she looked up in time to catch sight of another volley a split second before it caught her in the bicep.</p> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d she hissed, unprepared for a full-on attack in the middle of the damn day.</p><p>A blonde was racing toward her, another blade flying from her grip. Vash barely lurched out of the way in time, the smell of her own blood stirring the hunger in her.</p><p>A human. What the hell?</p><p>Vash charged, ready to take the crazy bitch down, when she smelled lycan. He raced out from beneath the shadow of the hotel\u2019s front awning, chasing the crazy blonde with the death wish.</p><p>It hit her then: Shadoe. Followed swiftly by the identifying scent of her guard dog . . .</p><p>The fucking bastard who\u2019d kidnapped Nikki.</p><p>Stunned into senselessness, Vash skidded to a halt, earning her another blade in the thigh.</p><p>The two people she was in town to capture were coming straight toward her, and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing she could do about it. Not while she was alone. Not without her weapons. Not with witnesses.</p> <p>Another blade nailed her in the shoulder, damn near dead center of the first hit she\u2019d taken.</p><p>She had taught Shadoe how to throw like that. She had taught her how to hunt, how to kill. It was clear to Vash right away: Shadoe was deliberately avoiding hitting vital organs and arteries. The crazy blonde thought she was going to capture a vamp.</p><p>Vash grabbed a blade out of her shoulder and lobbed it at the lycan, then discarded the one in her leg and lunged forward, hitting Shadoe in the chest with her palms and throwing her backward several feet to crash into her lycan guard. The two went down, and Vash fled, leaping onto the hood of a nearby Jaguar and running up to its roof. She vaulted up and over the stone wall that divided the Belladonna parking lot from that of the dinner theater\u2019s next door, her rage so wild she could barely see straight.</p><p>She never ran away. She never took multiple hits. She never let anyone live who spilled her blood. But she couldn\u2019t take out Syre\u2019s daughter. She couldn\u2019t kill Shadoe.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn! Shit! Fuck!\u201d she shouted.</p><p>Her boots hit the roof of a Suburban on the other side of the wall, the alarm activating in an eruption of horn blaring. Her right heel broke off and stole her balance, sending her tumbling down the windshield, across the hood, and onto the asphalt.</p><p>She\u2019d barely regained her footing when she heard another body hit the car behind her. Glancing over her shoulder, she saw the blonde hot on her heels. Vash took another hit in the shoulder, the sizzle of silver sending agony racing through her veins. Unable to pull a dagger out of her back, she could only run forward and hope like hell an escape route opened up. Ahead of her was a busy street, but that didn\u2019t seem to deter Shadoe. Whatever had crawled up Syre\u2019s daughter\u2019s ass was goading her like a cattle prod.</p><p>A white full-sized pickup truck bounced into the lot with too much speed, racing toward her. Vash was calculating the trajectory needed to leap over it when it spun out and swung around. Salem\u2019s head shot out the driver\u2019s-side window. \u201cGet in!\u201d</p><p>She jumped into the back and he hit the gas, kicking up loose asphalt and leaving behind a cloud that smelled of burning rubber. A throwing knife hit the rear of the cab with a sharp ping. Vash ducked with a curse.</p><p>The truck squealed into the swift-moving traffic to a chorus of angry horns and the crunch of metal and fiberglass. They were a good two miles away before Vash felt safe enough to pop her head up.</p><p>\u201cYou asked for reports of abductions.\u201d</p><p>Syre looked up from the spreadsheets on the monitor in front of him and met the gaze of the vampress in his office doorway. \u201cYes, Raven.\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired beauty entered with an unconsciously sensual stride. She wore mile-high black stilettos, a knee-length pencil skirt, and a button-down shirt that hugged full breasts. Apparently she was acting the role of naughty secretary, one of the many games she played to keep things interesting.</p><p>\u201cThere was a raid last night in Oregon,\u201d she said. \u201cA group of Sentinels invaded a nest and took several minions with them.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back in his chair, Syre wondered at Adrian\u2019s growing boldness. To infect minions with a disease seemed unlike him. He was a warrior who engaged in and excelled in physical combat. Biological warfare wasn\u2019t a tactic Syre would ever have attributed to the Sentinel leader. Something had changed, or was in the process of changing.</p><p>For the first time in many, many years, Syre felt the clock ticking with brutal impatience. Torque had been pushing him to act, instead of react, for many years now. It looked like that time might indeed be nigh.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSend a team out to Oregon. I want to know every detail of the raid. And keep me apprised of any further reports immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Syre.\u201d</p><p>Raven left the room. He attempted to return his focus to the screen in front of him. The effort was futile. When the phone rang, he reached for it with relief, his thoughts still occupied by Adrian\u2019s offensive moves.</p><p>You have no idea of what I\u2019m authorized to do, the Sentinel leader had said just a few short weeks earlier. Perhaps there was a wealth of threat in those words that Syre had been oblivious to.</p><p>The raised voice of the caller on the other end of the line was audible before he even placed the receiver by his ear.</p><p>\u201cCalm yourself, Vash,\u201d he soothed. \u201cSlow down. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stiffened as she continued spewing words in a rush, all but one thought dissipating from his mind. Act, instead of react.</p><p>It was indeed the time.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck were you thinking?\u201d Adrian asked in that cool, modulated tone of voice that made Lindsay grit her teeth.</p><p>As wired as she felt, she\u2019d prefer him to yell or raise his voice, pace or glower\u2014something. Instead, he stood casually in front of his desk and spoke so calmly he might have been commenting on the weather. It was only the distant rumble of thunder that told her he wasn\u2019t taking the news of her reckless assault on one of the Fallen with anything less than total aplomb.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for that vampire my whole damn life,\u201d she bit out, \u201cand there she was, strolling right by me. I had to do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the middle of the day. You were surrounded by dozens of tourists.\u201d</p><p>Her arms crossed. \u201cI don\u2019t have forever to hunt her down. If I have to wait another twenty years to find her, I might not be physically capable of doing anything about it. I might not even be alive. It\u2019s now or never.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s flame blue gaze bored into her, searing her with its heat. \u201cYou\u2019ve now exposed yourself to the Fallen. They\u2019re going to come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope they send her,\u201d Lindsay shot back defiantly. \u201cNext time, I won\u2019t play with her. I\u2019ll just take her down.\u201d</p><p>Damien made a noise that drew her attention. \u201cIf you could have killed her, why didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I need to know where the other two assholes are. She was alone when I first saw her. I didn\u2019t see anyone with her until she was rescued. And, by the way, the guy driving the getaway vehicle had the same crazy crayon-colored spiked hair I remember from the day they attacked my mother. If she\u2019s still hanging with that dude, I\u2019m guessing the other one isn\u2019t far away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ramifications of what you\u2019ve done are going to haunt us. We don\u2019t hunt the Fallen. We can\u2019t. Their punishment is to live with what they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t suffering when she terrorized my mom; she was having a damn good time. That bloodsucking cunt doesn\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d She shot a look at Adrian, whose impassive face gave nothing away. Her stomach knotted. God, she didn\u2019t want to cause him any more trouble. But what could she have done? Her entire life had been built around avenging her mother. \u201cShe left me alive, so it\u2019s her stupid mistake that I\u2019m hunting her now. I guess she figured that, as a human, I wasn\u2019t going to grow up to be a threat. But that should absolve you of any blame. I\u2019m not one of you. I don\u2019t operate under the same rules. What I do shouldn\u2019t affect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a lycan with you,\u201d Adrian reminded. \u201cThat involves us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo cut me loose.\u201d She hated the soft note of pleading in her voice. \u201cI can\u2019t bring you anything but trouble. That\u2019s killing me, Adrian. It\u2019s breaking my heart.\u201d</p><p>With a harsh exhale, Adrian leaned his hip against his desk and wrapped his hands around the edge. \u201cWhen Vash shoved you into Elijah, she could have just as easily punctured your rib cage with her fist and ripped out your heart. You\u2019re only breathing now because she let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck would she do that? Again? I got the drop on her; I can do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Vash?\u201d Elijah\u2019s growl rumbled through the room. \u201cI want that hunt.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay glanced at him and gave a curt nod. Vash had taken people they loved from them, and it was time to make her pay.</p><p>Looking back at Adrian, Lindsay said, \u201cYou told me you\u2019d help me hunt her down. You dug around in my brain. You knew who she was. Were you lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But we need to provoke them into attacking us, not launch a war ourselves. We can take defense, not offense. There are rules and there are ways around those rules\u2014\u201d His cell phone rang, drawing his attention to where the phone rested on his desk. Frowning, he said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>He answered with a clipped \u201cMitchell.\u201d</p><p>As she watched, Adrian\u2019s face took on the hardness of stone. She could hear someone speaking rapidly, but couldn\u2019t make out the words. Elijah exhaled in a rush and stepped closer to her, as if to stand with her. Support her. A chilly sense of foreboding swept over her.</p><p>A long, drawn-out moment passed. Finally, Adrian nodded. \u201cYes. Stand by. I\u2019ll make the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>Putting the BlackBerry down with far too much care, Adrian swept his gaze from Damien to Elijah. A silent communication passed between them, and the two men moved to leave the room. Elijah\u2019s brief squeeze to her shoulder and Damien\u2019s pitying look tightened the cold knot of dread in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked when the door shut, leaving her and Adrian alone in his office.</p><p>He stepped toward her and gripped her upper arms in gentle hands. \u201cIt\u2019s your father, Lindsay. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The floor fell away from her and she swayed. Her chest felt as if it had just cracked open, the pain so excruciating she would have sunk to the floor if not for Adrian\u2019s hold.</p><p>\u201cHe was driving and swerved off the road. He hit a tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Tears streamed down her face. \u201cI don\u2019t fucking believe it. My dad handles cars like a pro. This is Vash\u2019s fault. She\u2019s Syre\u2019s second. She could order this.\u201d</p><p>Which made this partly her own fault.</p><p>His wings unfurled and wrapped around her, sheltering her. He caught her close, gripping her nape and hip to press her fully against him. \u201cI can\u2019t rule that out. I\u2019ll investigate until I know for sure.\u201d</p><p>A broken, serrated noise filled the room. Lindsay realized she was sobbing, her entire body racked by violent quaking.</p><p>Adrian held her, his warmth penetrating from the outside and sinking into her. No\u2014he was inside her. Inside her mind like before, curling around everything like insidious tendrils of smoke. Her agonized grief began to fade, the sharpest edges softened by a strange sense of comfort.</p><p>Lindsay wrenched away from him, stumbling backward before crumpling to the floor. \u201cWhat the f-fuck are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Crouching beside her, he reached to brush her hair away from her face. His eyes flickered with preternatural flame and glistened with tears. \u201cTaking away your pain. I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-what? How . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can pull the painful memories from you, neshama. I can heighten your recollection of the happy ones.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d She pushed to her feet, shoving away his hand when he reached to steady her. \u201cIf you ever steal a memory from me, painful or not, I\u2019ll never forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t resent the loss of something you don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>How she remained standing when it felt like a glowing-hot poker was piercing her chest was a miracle. \u201cIf you care about me at all, you won\u2019t take away the events that shaped me into who I am today . . . God\u2014\u201d She gripped her pounding head in her hands, her thoughts tumbling through her mind in a chaotic deluge. Her chest was heaving in its struggle for air, her sobs half crazed to her own ears. \u201cI have to go. I can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay tonight,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cCan you do that for me? You\u2019re in no condition to be alone now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdrian\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t even see him through the rush of tears that burned her eyes and throat. They\u2019d made love in this room, held each other for hours. It was fitting that she would face the punishment for that transgression in the same space. \u201cWe\u2019re killing each other. Every moment we spend together comes back to us in torment inflicted on people we love. We have to stay away from each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll let you go. But not tonight. Not like this. One night in my home, where I know you\u2019ll be safe. I won\u2019t disturb you. Can you give me that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise to let me go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, neshama sheli. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She no longer wanted to know what that meant. It was all too painful, the sweet and hot intimacy they shared. She nodded in acquiescence to his request, her mouth too dry to allow her to speak.</p> <p>He bowed his head slightly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>There was something in the severe austerity of his features that unsettled her. A hint of grim determination. But she couldn\u2019t take any more right now. She was falling apart, shattered by a blow she\u2019d never recover from.</p><p>Daddy . . .</p><p>Without another word, Lindsay left the office and shut the door behind her. She was a mess. Her life was a mess. And she was fucking up the lives of everyone around her.</p><p>She retreated to her room and crawled into bed, crying herself into dark, restless sleep.</p><p>Adrian packed an overnight bag with quiet deliberation. He set aside a week\u2019s worth of clothes, but didn\u2019t anticipate needing all of them. God willing, Syre would be dead within the next forty-eight hours.</p> <p>There was so little time. Vash had recognized Lindsay as Shadoe; there was no other reason for why she would\u2019ve allowed Lindsay to live. At this very moment, Syre knew his daughter had returned. The Fallen leader would be weighing his options. He\u2019d be consulting those he trusted, gathering data, and deciding what to do with it. Adrian had to get to him before that decision was made.</p><p>Then he had to get to Vashti. The attack on Lindsay\u2019s mother had been so unlike Syre\u2019s second that it could only have been done as a message to Adrian. Vash had to have known Lindsay was Shadoe and anticipated his learning of the murder when they inevitably met. The few decades in between were nothing to an immortal, the wait inconsequential.</p><p>The question was: why? If she\u2019d known who Lindsay was that long ago, why not tell Syre? Adrian intended to get the answer directly from the source.</p><p>Damn it. He hated hunting like this\u2014too poorly thought out, too hasty. That was why, in all of Shadoe\u2019s past incarnations, he\u2019d waited for Syre to come to him. Better to face his opponent on his home turf, where every advantage was at his fingertips. But sometimes a swift, foolhardy strike was just what was needed to slip beneath an enemy\u2019s defenses. He prayed that was the case this time, because he was going for it. Because this time was different. Lindsay was different. He was different with her. That was worth whatever price he would pay.</p><p>His gaze darted to the clock on the nightstand. It was shortly before midnight. Blessedly, Lindsay had stopped crying around ten, then fallen asleep. Every sob from her room had cut him deeper and deeper until now his heart bled steadily. It had never been like this between them. In the past, she\u2019d always swiftly wiled her way into his bed and stayed there. In any other incarnation, he\u2019d be in her arms now. Holding her, making love to her, choosing not to rush the inevitable confrontation with Syre, so that he could steal one more day with the woman he loved.</p><p>Now he had a flight booked that would take him to Raceport in a few short hours. He was traveling alone, flying commercial, and arriving just after sunrise. The time of day wouldn\u2019t affect Syre, but it would limit the number of minions Adrian had to contend with.</p><p>He was shoving another henley into his bag when he heard her whimper. He stilled, his senses zeroing in on the woman who was sleeping in the room next door. The mattress sighed as she moved; then a soft, sultry moan drifted over his senses.</p><p>Gooseflesh spread across Adrian\u2019s skin. He moved away from his bed, stepping closer to the wall, although proximity wasn\u2019t required. He could be up at the lycan barracks and still hear her breathing as if his ear were pressed to her chest.</p> <p>She began panting, then writhing. Another whimper shook him.</p><p>Incapable of resisting her when their time together was nearly at an end, Adrian left his room and moved the short distance down the hall to her door. He released the lock with an impatient thought and entered.</p><p>Her bedroom was shrouded in darkness. The drapes were drawn to block the views of the city in the distance. He closed the door behind him and moved silently toward the bed, his vision seeing her as clearly as if every light were on.</p><p>Lindsay had kicked off the covers. She twisted on the bed with sensual abandon, the lush scent of her desire going to his head and intoxicating him. Her hands cupped her breasts, squeezing through the satin of the tank top that matched the thong she wore.</p><p>Her back arched, offering up her beautiful breasts like a gift.</p><p>\u201cAdrian . . .\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a sharp breath at the erotic invitation in her voice. Reaching down, he rubbed the aching length of his erection through his slacks, his blood flowing hot and thick through his veins. He was so turned on by the willingness she displayed while sleeping, a willingness she denied him while awake because she cared for him. He understood the affection that motivated her. If she didn\u2019t love him, she wouldn\u2019t deny the needs that haunted her even in dreams.</p><p>Knowing he shouldn\u2019t, he willed his clothes into a haphazard pile on the floor. The cool night air felt good against his heated skin, almost like a caress from her hands. Lindsay gave another soft moan. His knee settled on the bed.</p><p>As the mattress dipped with his weight, her eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cAdrian,\u201d she whispered, rolling swiftly into his arms.</p><p>He groaned as her mouth pressed ardently to his, her tongue thrusting with a hunger that made his cockhead slick with wanting her. She pushed him back, tossing one silken leg across his hips and reaching between them to grip his cock in her slender hand. His neck arched with the pleasure of her touch, of her desire, of her lust given without reserve for the very first time.</p><p>She pressed down, the humid warmth of her sex soaking through the satin of her thong and searing the sensitive skin of his erection. Needing to feel her skin bare against his, he fisted her underwear, ripping it off her body. A hard shiver moved through him at how wet she was. The petal-soft feel of her denuded lips stroking along his length nearly brought him to climax.</p><p>\u201cAni rotza otha, Adrian.\u201d She purred, gliding her slick sex back and forth over him.</p><p>I want you.</p><p>He froze, his heart stilling in his chest. He knew that seductive tone all too well. \u201cShadoe?\u201d</p><p>She reared up, her hands sliding into Lindsay\u2019s sexy blond curls, undulating Lindsay\u2019s body as she weaved her sensual spell over him.</p><p>But it was no longer lust he felt as Shadoe\u2019s soul stared back at him from Lindsay\u2019s beautiful face.</p><p>A shivering exhalation left him.</p><p>She\u2019d lured him like this the very first time. It started with a stolen kiss. Then the taste of her breasts, offered up to him with both of her hands, the dark brown nipples peaked tight in the open air. He\u2019d begged her to leave him in peace, to respect the very law he had enforced on her father. He\u2019d begged her to be strong for him because he had been so weak over her.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d grown bolder with every month that passed. She had played with her body in front of him, deliberately haunting the places he frequented, teasing him with the sight of her glistening fingers pushing in and out of her pouting sex until she climaxed with his name on her lips. He\u2019d resisted her until she threatened to take a lover to her bed, then made sure he stumbled upon her fondling another man\u2019s cock through his clothes. Angry, possessive, tempted beyond reason, Adrian had given her what she\u2019d been asking him for, taking her on the ground like an animal in heat. And once he\u2019d fallen, there had been no turning back.</p><p>\u201cAni rotza otha,\u201d she said again, her hips rocking almost violently over him, riding him toward orgasm.</p><p>\u201cNo, tzel.\u201d</p><p>He caught her by the hips and rolled her off him, then moved away. Gaining his feet, he ran his hands through his hair, painfully aroused by the feel of Lindsay, the scent of her, the sound of her voice.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Lindsay who called to him from the bed behind him.</p><p>\u201cAni ohevet otchah,\u201d Shadoe whispered, rustling the sheets with sinuous movements.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>Adrian squeezed his eyes shut. His wings burst free and flexed angrily. He should have known better. Lindsay would never seduce him. She would have denied him, as she\u2019d been trying to do from the beginning. For his sake. Because she loved him.</p><p>He willed his clothes back on, then shoved his hands through his hair. When Shadoe\u2019s hand touched his bare shoulder, he grabbed it and spun, facing her.</p><p>\u201cTake me,\u201d she whispered, standing naked before him, possessing the body that so perfectly fit his, that held him so sweetly, that gave him such pleasure he wept with the power of it.</p><p>It was only a shell without the woman he loved inside it.</p><p>Adrian cupped Lindsay\u2019s face in his hands, looking into her eyes, the windows to a soul that wasn\u2019t her own. Bending his head, he pressed his lips to hers, softly, chastely, his heart aching for the woman he\u2019d once loved long ago. A woman so beautiful, fierce, and seductive she\u2019d lured an angel to fall. He had loved her with hot, saturating abandon.</p><p>But Shadoe\u2019s time had passed, and he had since fallen in love with someone else. A mortal whose love was selflessly given. A woman who accepted him just as he was, including the law and rules that had forged him yet also forbid them to be together.</p><p>His thumbs brushed over her cheekbones, and he pressed his forehead to hers. \u201cI\u2019m going to free you, Shadoe. I\u2019m going to let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she said again, reaching between them for his flagging erection.</p><p>Adrian arched his hips away from her touch and sent a rush of languidness through Lindsay\u2019s body. He caught her as she sagged unconscious, lifting her and carrying her to the bed. He could do nothing about the thong he\u2019d destroyed in the extremity of his need, so he covered her with the sheet. Brushing her hair back from her face, he kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cLindsay.\u201d He nuzzled his lips across her perspiration-damp skin. \u201cSoon it will all be over.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and left the room with a purpose-driven stride. The beating of his heart was quick and heavy, but his mind was clear for the first time in ages.</p><p>The weight of the past dissipated along with his wings.</p><p>As he undressed again and stepped beneath a cold shower, it all washed away\u2014the guilt and pain, the sorrow and remorse.</p><p>Why won\u2019t you let me save you? Lindsay had asked, unaware that she already had saved him in the most fundamental of ways. She\u2019d given him the strength he\u2019d lacked, and a sweet, precious love. There was so much she could teach him about how to love from the inside out. His biggest regret was that he\u2019d never have the chance to follow her lead.</p><p>But at least he could free her from his past. All the fear and indecision that had plagued him for centuries was gone. He was no longer debating the wisdom of his decision to strike first, within enemy territory. Lindsay was unhappy and Adrian couldn\u2019t bear it. He couldn\u2019t stand being the cause of her pain. If it was in his power to end her suffering, he had to try.</p><p>All these years, he\u2019d wanted to spare himself further self-recriminations. Instead of allowing Shadoe the peace of an honorable death in battle, he\u2019d selfishly tried to bind her to him with immortality. It was not his place to intercede once the Creator decided it was time for someone to die, and his punishment for doing so had been long and agonizing. He\u2019d intended to end the cycle as much for himself as for Shadoe.</p><p>Now he would act for Lindsay alone. He would give her back the life that should have been hers. A life of normalcy. A chance to be happy. The opportunity to find a man who would love her without all the chains that bound Adrian to his duty.</p><p>It was a gift he could give to her without strings. It wasn\u2019t equal to the gift she\u2019d given him, but it would be given selflessly and out of a deep love, the likes of which he\u2019d never known before.</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>The moment Lindsay awoke, she knew Adrian was gone. The feeling of emptiness inside her was so pervasive, it was gnawing. She moved to leave the bed and realized she was nude. For a second, she wondered why. Then the memories hit her in a rush.</p><p>I\u2019m going to let you go.</p><p>Soon it will all be over . . .</p><p>With a gasp, she bent at the waist, her rib cage gripped in a vise of excruciating heartbreak. Her father was dead. Daddy.</p><p>And she knew, as only a woman in love could know, that Adrian didn\u2019t intend to ever see her again.</p><p>Her eyes closed, but tears leaked free. She\u2019d lost the two most important individuals in her life at the same time. As she rocked with the pain, the echoes of her dreams came back to haunt her. She felt the burning desire coursing through her, so hot and powerful she couldn\u2019t resist it. Instead she had embraced it, amplified it, taken fierce pleasure in making Adrian bend like a reed beneath it. The power she\u2019d felt in garnering his capitulation against his will had been heady and addictive. And sickening. She had felt almost as if she was watching herself from the outside, unable to control her own wild impulses. When Adrian had turned away from her, she\u2019d been so relieved for both of them. So grateful that he possessed the strength she lacked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he hadn\u2019t turned away for a moment. He\u2019d turned away from her forever. His voice in her dreams had been devoid of the aching tenderness she had become accustomed to feeling in it.</p><p>A half-crazed, half-sobbing laugh escaped her.</p><p>Pushing to her feet, Lindsay straightened and knew she had to get her head on straight. She had to return to Raleigh, and she expected to stay there for a while. She needed to get her bearings, figure out where she was going from here. She needed to regroup, then plan for how to hunt down Vash. The desire for vengeance was so pervasive she could barely think beyond it. That was a blessing in a way. Revenge gave her something to focus on beside her debilitating grief.</p><p>She showered and dressed. When she made the bed, she found her shredded panties. Whether she\u2019d ripped them off herself in the throes of her erotic dream or Adrian had actually been with her and done it, the end result was the same\u2014it was over between them.</p> <p>\u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d she muttered, wondering why she didn\u2019t just learn to stop wishing for things at all.</p><p>She stepped out onto the wraparound deck, noting from the position of the sun in the sky that it was late morning. There were no angels flying; no clouds, either. It was a beautiful day, the kind Southern Californians enjoyed most of the year.</p><p>Lost in her misery, Lindsay took a set of stairs leading down the side of the hill to a smaller deck a few hundred yards below. From there, the city view was lost, leaving one with the impression that they were alone in the far reaches of the native SoCal landscape.</p><p>She set her elbows on the railing and began searching the contacts list on her cell phone. There were so many calls and arrangements to make. She made herself go through the motions, despite feeling so hollow and cold inside. Dead.</p><p>A massive winged shadow swept over her.</p> <p>An angel\u2019s shadow, followed by the rustling of feathers as the Sentinel landed behind her. Feeling a desperate, futile hope that it might be Adrian and not wanting to let go of it, she hesitated a second before turning to face her companion.</p><p>A hand touched her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGood morn\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>She fell into unconsciousness before she finished the greeting.</p><p>Adrian rolled into Raceport on a Harley he\u2019d purchased just an hour before. It was early afternoon. Most of the minions were ensconced in the darkness somewhere, sleeping. Unfortunately, Raceport had one of the highest concentrations of Fallen in the country. After all this time, they still hovered around Syre like moths to a flame, even though they\u2019d all already been burned and disfigured.</p><p>If he had a contingent of Sentinels with him or a pack of lycans, he\u2019d be in a much better position. But even with the need for success being paramount, Adrian refused to involve anyone in his personal vendetta. This was his battle. The consequences for what he was about to do would fall on his shoulders alone.</p> <p>He backed his bike into a spot directly in front of the general store. Syre\u2019s office was above it, as Adrian knew from vigilant and constant surveillance of the area\u2014just as Angels\u2019 Point was watched. It was all part of the careful dance between them, the need to maintain a balance even as everything shifted and moved around them.</p><p>Dismounting, he withdrew a shotgun from its holster on the bike. He wore a pistol and a dagger strapped to each thigh, and his spine tingled with the need to employ his most powerful weapons. The rage of angels pumped hot and hard through his veins.</p><p>Before he reached the bottom step of the exterior staircase leading up to the Fallen leader\u2019s office, Adrian knew something was off. Raceport was crowded as always, due to its reputation for being a mecca for motorcycle enthusiasts from all over the country, but very few people glanced twice at him. Even when a group of chaps-wearing women across the street catcalled and whistled to him, it didn\u2019t divert much attention his way. If Syre had been nearby, security would be as tight as what Adrian employed at Angels\u2019 Point.</p><p>Grim faced and determined, he climbed the stairs without incident and stepped into the hallway at the top.</p><p>Two shadowy figures rushed toward him. He took them down with bullets, unable to utilize his wings in such a small space. Two more came up behind him just before he reached Syre\u2019s office. He threw open the door and darted in, hearing a scream from one of his pursuers as sunlight flooded the hallway behind him.</p><p>Kicking the door shut, Adrian shoved a chair beneath the knob, all without taking his eyes or his pistol barrel off the vampress seated at Syre\u2019s desk.</p><p>\u201cHello, Adrian,\u201d she muttered, her lips curved in a smile that didn\u2019t reach her eyes. Sunlight fell over her pale bare arms and chocolate-colored hair. Her amber eyes glittered like tiger\u2019s-eye, but he remembered when they\u2019d been blue like his own.</p><p>\u201cRaven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not even in Virginia.\u201d</p><p>He moved to the closet door, opened it, and shot a cursory glance inside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just you and me,\u201d she assured. \u201cAnd I have orders not to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So we\u2019re playing by the same rules.\u201d</p><p>She stood in a singularly graceful movement, revealing an ultrashort denim skirt that she wouldn\u2019t be able to bend over in without exposing herself. Her top was gingham and tied in a knot between her full breasts, giving her a country-girl appearance he was sure went over well with the men visiting the area.</p><p>Rounding the desk, she trailed the fingertips of her right hand down her left arm and looked up at him beneath long, thick lashes. \u201cYou look good, Adrian. Real good. Having sex suits you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, used to this game. The Fallen liked to taunt Sentinels with their sexuality. It was as if they wanted to flaunt the reason for their fall, as well as goad beings known for their abstinence. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d She sidled closer, licking her lower lip.</p><p>He whipped out his wing, forcing her to spin away to avoid getting sliced. She ended up sprawled facedown atop the desk. He had her hands pinned behind her back before she could retaliate.</p><p>Bending over her, he hissed in her ear, \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to manhandle me,\u201d she shot back, struggling. \u201cHe wants me to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Adrian knew why. His stomach knotted. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way to California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d she purred malevolently, grinning, \u201che\u2019s already there.\u201d</p><p>Syre turned away from the bed upon which his daughter slept and exited out into the living room of the two-room hotel suite he\u2019d reserved in Irvine. Torque sat on the couch with his elbows on his knees and his fingers steepled together beneath his chin. Vash paced restlessly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s brainwashed,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long Adrian has had her, but he\u2019s trained her well. She tried to kill me!\u201d</p><p>Torque met his gaze and shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t see her in action, but I patched up Vash\u2019s wounds. Shadoe did a number on her.\u201d</p><p>Vash\u2019s long hair swayed around her hips with her agitated movements. \u201cI don\u2019t think you have time to talk it out with her. It\u2019ll take years to deprogram her, and the lycan who was with her is the one who snatched Nikki.\u201d</p><p>Torque growled.</p><p>Syre ran a hand through his hair. His phone had beeped with a text message an hour before, telling him Adrian had made an appearance in Raceport. By now the Sentinel leader knew Lindsay Gibson was out of his safekeeping and a search would have been mounted. They didn\u2019t have long before it would be impossible to leave the state without Adrian knowing about it. If Syre hadn\u2019t Changed Shadoe by then, nothing would save them.</p><p>\u201cYou might have to turn her first,\u201d Torque said, \u201cthen explain later. Once she\u2019s back to being Shadoe, she won\u2019t have reason to hate us anymore. She\u2019ll remember what we are to her.\u201d</p><p>Syre moved to the adjoining door and waved them out. \u201cGo. Both of you. Leave me alone with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not wise,\u201d Vash said. \u201cShe might try to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout the lycan here to tell her what I am, how will she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming she can\u2019t tell. But I saw her run\u2014watched her leap over a damn eight-foot-high wall. She\u2019s not entirely mortal, whatever the hell she smells like.\u201d</p><p>She smelled like Adrian, which turned Syre\u2019s stomach. He was ready for her to know why she\u2019d suffered all these years. He was ready for her to remember just how much Adrian\u2019s desire had cost her.</p><p>\u201cThen Shadoe is close to the surface in Lindsay Gibson,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m safer than you give her credit for. Now go. Help Torque track the lycan. Let\u2019s try to tie up all the loose ends we can while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>They shuffled out the door into the connecting room, with Vash sending him a scowl over her shoulder. He turned the lock behind them, smiling. Vash hated to be bested in anything. That she\u2019d been bested by a student of hers was chafing her mightily. If Lindsay Gibson hadn\u2019t been the vessel carrying his daughter, she\u2019d be dead now.</p><p>He heard the soft creak of the mattress in the bedroom and turned to face the door leading into it, his heart thudding violently in his chest. He\u2019d never been this close to having her back. Adrian had always kept her close, waiting for Syre to break down and come for her. The Sentinel had no idea how many attempts Syre had made over the years. Adrian was too precise, too methodical\u2014a machine. It was next to impossible to break his code. But something was different this time. Something had prompted him to act rashly, to allow her out into the open, to leave her alone . . . It had to be Lindsay Gibson herself and how close Shadoe was to the surface in her. Maybe that\u2019s what Adrian had been waiting for all this time.</p><p>She appeared in the doorway, her gaze as sharp as a hawk\u2019s. A predator\u2019s gaze. The gaze of a huntress. It lit on him first, then swept around the relatively small space. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow precise do you want me to be?\u201d</p><p>He saw the shadow of confusion sweep across her features. She looked nothing like him, nothing like her mother or brother, whose Asian heritage was evident in their skin tone and sloe eyes. But something in her recognized him, and that perplexed her.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Syre. A vampire\u201d\u2014his mouth curved gently, with genuine affection\u2014\u201cand your father.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay stared at the seriously hot man standing a few feet away from her . . .</p><p>. . . and broke into crazed laughter that bubbled up from the stew of emotions inside her. She laughed until tears came to her eyes and coursed down her cheeks. She laughed until her chest was racked with harsh, hiccoughing sobs.</p><p>Syre, who actually managed to look alarmed, took a tentative step toward her. She lifted up her hand to hold him off.</p><p>He stopped. The leader of the vampires, who\u2019d somehow kidnapped her from Angels\u2019 Point, stopped at her uplifted hand.</p><p>He deferred to her. And she knew him.</p><p>It was a quiet surety inside her. She knew the fallen angel who stood across the room from her, looking far too young to be her father. He was gorgeous. Tall and elegant, like a Sentinel, but much darker. Definitely dangerous. Not just in his looks, although those were dark and dangerous, too. His black hair and caramel-hued skin were paired with eyes the color of toffee, making him stunning in a wholly exotic way.</p><p>God, the thought of him squaring off against Adrian was insane to her. They were too evenly matched.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d she asked, recognizing the brand of the hotel by its signature layout but unsure of where the property was located.</p><p>\u201cIrvine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He gestured for her to have a seat. As she did with Adrian, she felt an inexplicable pull to the suave vampire leader. She didn\u2019t trust it\u2014didn\u2019t trust him. Vampires lured victims with seduction and a lulling sense of false security.</p><p>Lindsay moved to the wet bar instead and pulled the corkscrew out of the drawer. As far as weapons went, it was laughable. But beggars couldn\u2019t be choosy.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to defend yourself against me, tzel,\u201d he murmured, taking a seat at the small dining table as if he had no concerns in the world.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that,\u201d she snapped, hating to hear Adrian\u2019s term of endearment for her on another man\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s your name.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing hard, she fought another wave of dizziness and intense d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, so familiar now after the last few weeks but no less disconcerting. \u201cMy name is Lindsay Gibson. My father\u2019s name is\u2014was\u2014Eddie Gibson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose things are true . . . in regard to your mortal body.\u201d His amber eyes watched her with undeniable intensity. \u201cBut you carry the soul of my daughter Shadoe inside you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay felt the blood drain from her face.</p><p>\u201cDid you think it was just a pet name Adrian had for you?\u201d Syre\u2019s slightly raspy voice was mesmerizing. \u201cAn endearment perhaps?\u201d</p><p>His direct hit struck her hard.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see that you did.\u201d His smile was smugly knowing. \u201cI bet he took one look at you and there was no getting away from him. He focused on you with an all-consuming intensity, didn\u2019t he? He pursued you swiftly and with a determination you couldn\u2019t deny. He treated you like the most precious thing in the world. And when a seraph like Adrian puts his mind to something, he never fails.\u201d</p><p>Leaning heavily into the countertop, she set one hand over her roiling stomach and tried to regulate her breathing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful woman, Lindsay. I\u2019m sure he was sincerely attracted to the packaging. But the woman he covets is inside you\u2014my daughter\u2014and he\u2019s been keeping us apart since the dawn of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d she whispered through dry lips. \u201cI\u2019m not possessed by someone else\u2019s spirit.\u201d</p><p>His chin lifted. \u201cSo how do you explain your speed? How do you explain the first question you asked when you walked into this room\u2014\u2018What are you?\u2019 not \u2018Who are you.\u2019 You felt the power in me with senses beyond the few afforded to your mortal body.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him, her right leg beginning to twitch and shake with her growing disquiet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wondering how it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said, still in that low, captivating tone. \u201cYou see, Shadoe was fatally wounded. You were a huntress even then. Adrian loved you so much, he couldn\u2019t bear to lose you. I\u2019d already discovered that I could share immortality with others, and he brought you to me on the brink of death, begging me to save you.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay didn\u2019t realize she was crying until she felt the drops hitting her chest.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hesitate,\u201d he went on. \u201cI began the process of Changing you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInto a vampire?\u201d She was sickened by the thought.</p><p>He gave a soft, humorless laugh. \u201cAdrian\u2019s reaction was the same. He thought I could heal you without Changing you. You were too far gone for his blood to do the trick, but he\u2019d heard that the Change took individuals to the very precipice of death, and he thought I could pull you back from it. Which I could, but as a vampire. When he realized what you would become, he finished you himself with a blade through the heart.\u201d</p><p>She flinched imagining what that would have cost Adrian\u2014to kill the woman he loved in order to save her. But she understood it, too. Like her, every blow he\u2019d been dealt in his life had come from a vampire. Of course he would rather lose his love than have her become a soulless, bloodsucking creature.</p><p>\u201cBut it was already too late. You were a naphil, one of the nephalim\u2014a child born to a mortal and an angel. Your soul was stronger than a mere human\u2019s. It had the strength of an angel\u2019s, but without the weakness of wings. I\u2019d given you just enough of my blood to immortalize that inhuman part of you before Adrian killed your body. So you\u2019ve returned again and again, always in a different vessel but still my daughter.\u201d</p><p>Still the woman Adrian loved. A woman that wasn\u2019t her.</p> <p>Her spine straightened. \u201cA pretty s-story, but I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo turn me against Adrian.\u201d</p><p>He made a soft tsking noise. \u201cOn the contrary, I can give him back to you. Fully, completely. I know you want that. I can see how much you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>Pushing to his feet, he stepped closer. \u201cI can finish the Change, Lindsay. I can give you immortality and reawaken the soul in you that Adrian loves. I can take away the mortality that makes you forbidden to him. Everything can be what it should have been.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed, but it came out a broken and painful cry. \u201cOf course. Take Adrian\u2019s woman and make her a vampire. The ultimate revenge for the loss of your wings. It must kill you to see those crimson tips on his pretty feathers. It must be an agonizing reminder of how he mutilated you.\u201d</p><p>Syre was unfazed by her venomous outburst. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to believe me. Will you believe him?\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him.\u201d His beautiful eyes glittered like gemstones. \u201cAsk him yourself.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 22</p><p>Elijah watched the gates of the Navajo Lake pack entrance pass by the rear windows of the black Suburban he was in. He couldn\u2019t shake off the coiling apprehension rippling through him. Although Damien had assured him he wasn\u2019t being held responsible for Lindsay\u2019s abduction\u2014which had technically happened under the Sentinels\u2019 watch\u2014he\u2019d been immediately returned to Navajo Lake instead of being allowed to assist in the hunt for her. All of Adrian\u2019s pack was being sent to the Lake and a new pack was being formed.</p><p>The extreme scope of that act spoke of deep suspicion. Lindsay had been taken from the Point, which meant someone there was undeniably involved. Quarantining the lycans appeared to be the first step in the attempt to find the culprits.</p><p>Despite understanding the precariousness of his own situation, Elijah\u2019s greatest fear was for Lindsay. Once he\u2019d learned the identity of the vamp she\u2019d attacked, his stomach had bottomed out. Vash had already been hunting him because of the blood in Shreveport; then Lindsay had been spotted with him\u2014in the midst of launching an attack of her own. No matter how he looked at it, it looked bad for his friend. Real fucking bad. He doubted Lindsay would survive the day, if she wasn\u2019t already dead.</p> <p>And he was states away, unable to help her. The beast inside him was pacing restlessly, growling its desire to be slipped free of its leash. If he weren\u2019t an Alpha, he would have lost control hours ago. As it was, he was debating mutiny for the first time in his life. He didn\u2019t have enough friends to callously disregard losing one, and Lindsay was special to him\u2014she\u2019d already proven she would die to save his ass. He had yet to return the favor.</p><p>The Suburban rolled to a stop in the center of the outpost. Elijah climbed out. A half dozen full-sized vans pulled up in a line behind the SUV, and the rest of Adrian\u2019s pack emptied into the courtyard.</p><p>Jason approached him. \u201cYou got here quickly. Good. I\u2019ve narrowed the suspect pool to six individuals. One of them is responsible for stealing your blood. I thought you might like to question them.\u201d</p><p>Elijah stared at the Sentinel through his sunglasses, instantly put on guard by the show of camaraderie. Jason saw little value in lycans. They were occasionally useful, but always expendable\u2014treated worse than dogs at times.</p><p>The Sentinel patted him on the back and smiled. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be pleased. Instead you\u2019re scowling at me.\u201d</p><p>Catching on, Elijah twisted away from the Sentinel\u2019s touch. He was being shown off as a lycan who was more connected to the angels than he was to his own kind. That was why they\u2019d had him ride in the Suburban. That was why he was being singled out by Jason now. Elijah had thought they were keeping him close in preparation for punishment.</p><p>And he\u2019d been right, just not in the way he\u2019d expected.</p><p>Moving back toward the other members of Adrian\u2019s pack, he found them eyeing him with defiance and determination.</p><p>Rachel stepped forward and hissed. \u201cDo you think you\u2019re one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a smart girl, Rach. You know they\u2019re playing you and me both. They\u2019re playing all of us.\u201d</p><p>Jonas stepped closer. \u201cYou\u2019re Alpha, Elijah. What are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>The impetuous young lycan gestured at the thirty-foot-high log fence around them. \u201cIf I were Alpha, I\u2019d tear this place apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd go where?\u201d Elijah challenged.</p><p>Rachel\u2019s eyes glittered. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re afraid of, El. But you\u2019re going to have to make a decision about which side you\u2019re standing with. Don\u2019t let Micah\u2019s death be in vain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t put that on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all on you,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cMore than you know.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth to retort, but she shifted and howled. The rest of the pack altered their forms en masse, circling him in a blatant show of subservience. The Sentinels nearby unfurled their wings, their eyes aflame.</p><p>Jason stepped closer, with his wings curled forward in the familiar battle-ready pose. \u201cElijah\u2014\u201d</p><p>The pack responded to the implied threat to their Alpha\u2014a threat they\u2019d instigated\u2014by lunging forward in a writhing sea of multicolored fur.</p><p>Shouts shattered the mountain\u2019s tranquility. Angels took to the air. Lycans in lupine form poured from splintered doorways and shattered windows in an endless wave. Shots rang out and howls rent the air.</p><p>Elijah stood in the middle of utter chaos, watching everything he knew crumbling into pools of blood and fur and feathers. Screams reverberated through him, echoing in his horrified mind.</p><p>A bullet pierced his shoulder, the tiny bit of silver in it sizzling his flesh like acid. The lycans grew more frenzied and ferocious in reaction to the smell of his blood. With the choice taken from him, Elijah shifted and leaped into the fray, hoping to save as many lives as he could.</p><p>Adrian looked out of Syre\u2019s office windows at the town below. His blood had gone cold with trepidation. With every second that passed, he felt himself spiraling deeper into a primal state of rage.</p><p>His cell phone vibrated on the desktop. He felt Raven\u2019s wary eyes on him as he lifted it to his ear. \u201cMitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d</p><p>His breath exploded from his chest. \u201cLindsay! Where are you? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you prefer to call me tzel?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He sank into Syre\u2019s chair. \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long story, but the gist is that I carry the woman you love inside me. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated a moment, feeling the underlying pain in her voice. \u201cYou carry Shadoe\u2019s soul in you, yes.\u201d</p><p>Raven watched him avidly from the chair in the corner, her eyes sparkling with malicious glee.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you came up to me in the airport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first it was for her,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut that changed. What\u2019s grown between us since then is because of you, Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a few short weeks you got over the woman you\u2019ve loved for ages and fell for me?\u201d She made a choked noise, a sound so agonized his heart broke at the sound of it. \u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can prove it to you. Tell me where you are, how to find you. If I take Syre down, Shadoe\u2019s soul will be freed. It will just be you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said good-bye to me yesterday, Adrian. Not in so many words, but it was the end all the same. Is this why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, damn it.\u201d His hand fisted around a pen on the desktop. \u201cIt\u2019s because once I kill Syre, your body and soul will be your own. You won\u2019t feel evil around you anymore. You won\u2019t sense beings that aren\u2019t human. You won\u2019t have physical attributes that you\u2019ll have to hide. You can be normal. Lead a normal life. Enjoy all the precious mortal things you haven\u2019t had time for.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence filled only with the sounds of their mutual labored breathing. He heard a door close on her end of the line. \u201cSyre says he can fix this. He can make it right.\u201d</p><p>Adrian leaned forward. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him. He\u2019ll tell you whatever he has to in order to get what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says if he completes the Change, you can have Shadoe back. Forever this time. Immortally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no.\u201d The room spun around him. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it? All those centuries . . . all those incarnations . . . You\u2019ve found her and loved her. And lost her\u2014over and over again. Now there\u2019s a chance to stop all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s wrong, Lindsay.\u201d Adrian heard the hoarseness of his voice, the brutal desperation, and wondered why she couldn\u2019t. \u201cHe thinks Shadoe\u2019s naphil soul\u2014a soul that\u2019s part angel\u2014is stronger than yours. When she was alive, perhaps that was true. But she\u2019s not. She\u2019s a stowaway in your body. Your soul has a stronger hold on your physical form than hers does. You\u2019re not like the other incarnations of her. You feel her impulses, but you can ignore them. You have always been you since the moment we met. If you let Syre finish the Change, her soul will be freed, yours will die, and what will be left is a bloodsucking vampire. You don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want that for you.\u201d</p><p>He heard a soft sob.</p><p>\u201cLindsay.\u201d His eyes burned. His lungs were on fire. \u201cPlease. Please don\u2019t do this. Let me come to you, talk to you. You\u2019ve been through a lot in the last twenty-four hours. You\u2019re reeling from your father\u2019s death\u2014justifiably so. You need time to think. Time to heal. Let me be there for you, as you\u2019ve been there for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to think about this. No matter which way things go with the Change, you\u2019ll finally be free. Whether you\u2019re free with her or without her, this horrible cycle you\u2019ve suffered through will finally be over.\u201d</p><p>The pen snapped in his hand. Black ink burst across the desk. \u201cI can do the same thing by killing Syre. He started the Change; he\u2019s the only one who can finish it. Let me do it my way. Let me take care of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Lindsay. You. Not her. I did love her once, but not anymore. Not like I used to. Not for a long time, I realized last night. And never like I love you. I\u2019m begging you . . . with everything I am\u2014with everything that belongs to you\u2014don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you love me,\u201d she whispered, so quietly he barely heard her. \u201cAs much as you\u2019re able. But that\u2019s just another reason to finish this. As long as I\u2019m out there somewhere, you\u2019re never going to be able to let me go\u2014I can hear it in your voice. You\u2019re going to bash yourself against the rocks over and over until you\u2019re completely broken. I can\u2019t let you do it. At least once I\u2019ve Changed, you\u2019ll let me go. You won\u2019t want me as a vampire.\u201d</p><p>Adrian shoved to his feet, his BlackBerry cracking under the strain of his grip. \u201cLindsay!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Adrian. Good-bye.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay stepped out of the bedroom, freshly showered and feeling cleansed inside and out. Syre waited patiently at the dining table. She had the feeling he was the type of man who could sit absolutely still for hours, waiting, his patience infinite and unyielding. So much control and power\u2014it radiated from him as it did from Adrian. Adrian, whose beautiful voice had slashed and whipped with the force of his emotions. She was making him more human by the day, weakening him when he needed to be the strongest. Seeing Syre face-to-face proved that to her more than anything else. The vampire leader was a formidable force to be reckoned with, and his second was a homicidal manic. In the days ahead, Adrian would have to be at the top of his game in order to survive.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d He stood in a display of sleek fluidity and grace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>He gestured for her to return to the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d she asked, lying on the bed as directed. Her heart was racing so violently she thought she might have a heart attack.</p><p>The vampire leader sat on the bed beside her and took her hand in his. He met her gaze directly, his perfect features soft with affection. Just looking at him told her what a stunner Shadoe must have been. An exotic beauty whose love had enslaved Adrian forever.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to drink from you.\u201d His voice was as warm and intoxicating as heated brandy. \u201cI\u2019m going to drain you to the brink of death. Then I\u2019m going to fill you back up with the blood from my veins and it\u2019s going to Change you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy soul will die.\u201d</p><p>He looked for a moment like he might lie to her. Then he nodded. \u201cMortal souls don\u2019t survive the Change. But if it\u2019s any consolation, I think Shadoe will have absorbed some of you over the time you two have been together. You might continue to exist in that way. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be completely lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou are unique.\u201d</p> <p>She exhaled a shaky breath. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Syre brushed the hair back from her forehead. \u201cYou really love him. I wish I understood why. Every time you come back, you love him all over again.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes closed. \u201cPlease. Just get this over with.\u201d</p><p>She felt the humidity of his spice-scented breath against her wrist, then the sharp sting of his bite.</p><p>Lindsay floated in an oddly warm miasma. Like a swimmer on her back, she drifted languidly, all sense of time and urgency gone.</p><p>Around her, waves of memories rose and crested. Some were hers; most were not. She sifted through them with a lush fascination, watching reels of events like movies. So many versions of herself, as if she were the only actress in an endless play with multiple characters, settings, and time periods.</p> <p>In the back of her mind, she registered a distant burning. Around her, smoke and fire licked along the shores of her memories, making the water boil until it was uncomfortable against her bare flesh. She tried to twist away, then to dip beneath the waters, but below the surface there was no bottom. There was only an endless void and the tickling sensation of that abyss suckling at her toes, luring her downward.</p><p>She broke the surface and returned to her horizontal position, keeping her legs away from the seductive pull below.</p><p>There was no escaping the growing heat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll go away soon.\u201d</p><p>Turning her head in search of the speaker, Lindsay discovered a woman floating nearby. An exotic and breathtaking woman. A woman whose rich beauty would make a stunning pairing with Adrian\u2019s dark magnificence.</p><p>\u201cShadoe.\u201d</p><p>Shadoe\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cHello, Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and they linked fingers. A swift rush of cooling relief raced up Lindsay\u2019s arm from the contact. Her mind filled with images of Syre and a beautiful Asian woman. They were laughing. Playing. Chasing two young giggling children through a field of tall grasses. Syre had wings. Great, magnificent wings of azure blue that perfectly matched the color of his irises. They spread and stretched in a visible manifestation of his joy. He lifted the little girl high and kissed her forehead. Lindsay felt the press of those lips against her own skin, felt the rush of paternal love that accompanied it as if it were for her.</p> <p>Syre set Shadoe down and chased his son, an adorable boy with chubby arms and legs. Shadoe moved to where her mother was laying out a picnic. She sat on the edge of the blanket and tossed small pieces of some kind of vegetable near the edge of the clearing, where the grasses began their domination of the landscape.</p><p>A small rabbitlike creature appeared, soft, fluffy, and white. It followed the vegetable trail to Shadoe, who stroked its trusting head with her fingertips. When the creature grew bolder and reared up to set its front paws on Shadoe\u2019s thigh, she laughed with delight and scooped it up like Syre had done to her only moments before. She nuzzled her freckled nose against the sweet animal\u2019s, then buried her face in its neck.</p><p>The creature\u2019s scream startled Lindsay so violently she jerked and sank beneath the waves. The memory slid away from her, getting caught in the churning surf near the burning shoreline, but not before Lindsay caught the ripe smell of blood and the beauty of crimson soaking into pristine white. Like Adrian\u2019s wings.</p><p>She kicked her way back up to the surface, gasping with a mixture of fear, fascination, and building hunger. The scent of the creature\u2019s blood drove her wild. Her mouth watered with the desire to drink it greedily the way Shadoe had.</p><p>Shadoe smiled at Lindsay\u2019s sputtering breaths. The naphil floated gracefully on her back with her hands tucked behind her head. Her dark hair fanned outward, as did the transparent gauzy skirts of her dress. She looked like a nymph, beautiful and seductive.</p><p>\u201cYou were already a vampire,\u201d Lindsay accused.</p><p>\u201cNo. The nephalim thirsted for blood before the Watchers fell. Our angel halves needed the energy found in the life force of others.\u201d There was no horror or remorse in the woman\u2019s voice. No shame or embarrassment.</p><p>Lindsay struggled to make sense of it all. The raging heat was slowly fading and languidness returned to her. She felt like taking a nap, like sinking into the silken embrace of the memories around her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s loved me forever,\u201d Shadoe said casually. \u201cObsessively.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>New recollections lapped over her. She recognized some of them from her dreams. They made sense now. Every image and scene held Adrian in moments of lust and passion. Lindsay watched with a sharp, ferocious jealousy. She closed her eyes but still found no relief. The memories were in her head, her mind. Whispering. Crooning. Pleading. She was about to dive beneath the waves just to get away from them when she saw herself. She stilled her restless thrashing and took it all in, reliving the tender moments she\u2019d shared with Adrian.</p><p>I need you, tzel.</p><p>Pain seared her at the understanding of what that meant: while making love to her, he\u2019d been thinking of someone else.</p><p>The reminiscences continued unabated, giving her no peace.</p><p>Take me, neshama sheli.</p><p>She cried at the heated emotion radiating from Adrian as he asked her to take everything he offered her.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d she asked Shadoe in a voice made husky by heartbreak and longing. \u201c \u2018Neshama sheli\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means \u2018my soul.\u2019 It\u2019s an endearment.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay absorbed that. As the memories swirled around her, spinning faster and faster until a vortex formed in a downward spiral, she noted how his endearments for her changed as their relationship progressed. Toward the end, he referred to her only as his soul. Not Shadoe\u2019s. His.</p><p>No, tzel. I\u2019m going to free you. I\u2019m going to let you go...</p><p>He\u2019d been saying good-bye to Shadoe, not her.</p><p>Lindsay kicked upward, fighting the voracious sucking of the whirlpool. She was screaming, shouting for help, drowning with the sudden realization of how poorly she\u2019d interpreted her dreams the night before.</p><p>Adrian loved her. And god knew she was crazy enough about him to die for his happiness. Which appeared to be what she was to him\u2014the woman who made him happy.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t give him up. She refused. He knew her inside and out. From the beginning, he\u2019d allowed her to choose which direction she wanted to travel, and whichever road she chose\u2014the hotel or the hunt, with or without him\u2014he had made accommodations to allow her that freedom while still keeping her safe. She could be herself with him and he would love her that way. Cherish her.</p><p>With all her might, Lindsay fought the relentless pull of the now glowing abyss below her, but the cyclonic recollections around her rose higher and higher, and the reels of images in the sky above her seemed farther and farther away.</p><p>\u201cShadoe!\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou\u2019ll never have all of him. Never again.\u201d</p><p>An arm shot out and grasped her wrist. Shadoe leaned over the lip of the vortex, her long black hair hanging in a satiny curtain around her lovely face.</p><p>\u201cPart of him belongs to me now.\u201d Lindsay whimpered, her shoulder separating from its socket as she was pulled in two directions. \u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as the type of woman who\u2019s willing to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay\u2019s jaw tightened against the pain. \u201cI\u2019ll take whatever I can have of him,\u201d she bit out. \u201cIf he thinks of you sometimes, I can live with that. Can you live with him making love to my body when he\u2019s with you?\u201d</p><p>Shadoe\u2019s sloe eyes narrowed. Then her lush red lips curved in a smile. She released Lindsay\u2019s arm, and Lindsay fell toward the radiant light below.</p><p>\u201cShadoe.\u201d</p><p>Her rival dived into the vortex, racing past Lindsay with her arms outstretched and her hands clasped together in a narrow blade. She cut through the light and disappeared inside it. Instantly the whirlpool\u2019s direction changed, surging upward. As the moving pictures above Lindsay rushed down to meet her, she held her breath and closed her eyes.</p><p>She was spit out of the tempest with a gasping breath of cognizance.</p><p>Jackknifing up, Lindsay woke in a strange bed. She blinked at finding Kent Magus sitting in a chair beside her.</p><p>\u201cKent?\u201d she queried, realizing she was drenched with sweat. So much sweat that the comforter and sheets beneath her were soaked with it, too. Something hard rattled around in her mouth. She spit it out, then another one. She winced at the sight of her two human canine teeth in her palm. \u201cWhat are you doing in my dream?\u201d</p><p>Kent stared at her, then frowned. \u201cLindsay . . . ? Where\u2019s Shadoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the hots for her, too?\u201d Her gaze narrowed. Kent\u2019s handsome features echoed the woman\u2019s she had just said good-bye to in her mind . . . or soul\u2014wherever. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. Not coming back. Off to a better place and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he whispered, running his hand through hair that had become spiky from his restless fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed at teary, reddened eyes. \u201cI\u2019m your\u2014I\u2019m Shadoe\u2019s brother, Torque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I thought you were my night auditor.\u201d She fell back into the wet bedclothes with a groan, certain she was both crazy and dying. No one could feel as bad as she did and live through it. Violent shudders wracked her body as if she were freezing, but she was burning up. Her mouth felt stuffed with cotton that tasted like an ashtray. Her stomach was churning as if ready to heave, and her head was throbbing so viciously she felt like something was trying to slam its way out of her skull from the inside.</p><p>But the reality she\u2019d woken up to was worse.</p><p>She was still Lindsay, still crazy about Adrian, and she was one of the things they both hated and hunted\u2014a vampire.</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>Adrian saw the smoke rising from the remnants of the Navajo Lake pack miles before he reached it. When Damien pulled the Suburban through the gates, they entered a literal war zone. Very little remained intact. Fires burned untended. What had once been the cryogenic storage facility was a charred hole in the ground several meters deep. Not one window remained unbroken. Feathers dotted the ground along with dozens of naked corpses.</p><p>For the first time in two days, an emotion penetrated the thick haze of grief clouding Adrian\u2019s mind and heart.</p><p>Climbing out of the truck, he surveyed the devastation. He rubbed at the dull pain in his chest and asked, \u201cHow many Sentinel casualties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive, including Jason.\u201d</p><p>More losses in a matter of hours than they\u2019d been dealt in centuries, plus two lieutenants lost in a single month. \u201cHow many lycans were killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to thirty.\u201d Damien looked pale and drawn. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s likely some fled and died from their wounds elsewhere. There are a few who stayed loyal to us, but I don\u2019t know how useful they\u2019ll be. The other lycans will kill them on sight.\u201d</p><p>Adrian wandered through the ruined outpost. This blow was the worst yet, one very likely to cause the destruction of every Sentinel.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t at his best. Everything was murky, as if he were looking at the world through cracked, dirty glass.</p><p>Where was Lindsay? How was she? Had she gone through with the Change? Was Syre even now enjoying the return of his daughter after all these centuries apart?</p><p>The thought of crossing paths with Shadoe in Lindsay\u2019s body cut through Adrian like razors, yet he knew that day was coming if the Change had gone through as Syre predicted. He had no idea how he would survive such an encounter. He could only beg the Creator to spare him such agony.</p><p>He forced his scattered mind to focus on the immediate horror facing them. \u201cHas news of this spread to the other packs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all,\u201d Damien replied grimly. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t been able to reach the Andover or Forest River packs since early yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Adrian returned to the SUV for the tools stored in the back. \u201cAs per protocol, we\u2019ll burn the bodies, then level this place. We can\u2019t leave anything behind for the curious to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Captain.\u201d</p><p>The use of his rank chilled him. \u201cWhen we get back to the Point, you and Oliver should put your heads together and come up with some suggestions for how to proceed from here. By the day after tomorrow, you should have settled on a replacement for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrian.\u201d</p><p>He felt the weight of Damien\u2019s gaze on his profile. The other Sentinels with them, Malachai and Geoffrey, stepped closer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said gruffly, his throat tight with remorse. It was his duty to support his men and give them encouragement and motivation when their morale was low. But he was lost himself. \u201cI failed you all. I should have withdrawn from the mission the moment I fell. Perhaps this could\u2019ve all been avoided.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lindsay. Where are you?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always believed your ability to feel human emotion is an asset to us,\u201d Damien said.</p><p>Beside him, Malachai nodded.</p><p>Geoffrey, a seraph of few words, shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I\u2019ve never found a mortal woman attractive.\u201d</p> <p>Wings flexing restlessly, Adrian took several moments to decide what to say. \u201cPerhaps we should recall all the Sentinels to the Point. Together, reflection may give us the answers and strength we seek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take strength from you, Captain,\u201d Malachai said with quiet conviction.</p><p>How was that possible, Adrian wondered, when he didn\u2019t have any strength to give? He didn\u2019t know if there were hidden reserves left within him, he felt so tapped out.</p><p>Lindsay. Where are you?</p><p>The vein pulsed and throbbed with life, pumping nutrient-rich blood through the maid\u2019s industriously working body.</p> <p>Lindsay heard every beat of the woman\u2019s heart as if she had a stethoscope to her ear. Her canines elongated and her mouth watered. Her hands fisted against the driving urge to feed.</p><p>Nearby, Syre sat on the love seat with his elbows resting on his parted knees and his forehead in his hands. His face was downturned, but Lindsay knew his gaze was bleak. He was grieving, his pain a palpable thing in the hotel room.</p><p>Torque stood in front of the small refrigerator at the wet bar, guarding the empty blood bags they\u2019d used while watching her complete the Change. He studied her too closely, searching, as if he might find his sister in her, or some other miracle.</p><p>As for Lindsay, she sat at the small dining table and waited for the red-haired murderess to make an appearance. Impatient and anxious, the fingers of her right hand spun her cell phone on the tabletop. The red light blinking above the screen told her she had unheard messages from both Adrian and Elijah, but she felt no urge to listen. She was too far gone with hunger, like a junky jonesing for a fix. She was shaky and nauseous. Her body craved sustenance, but her stomach roiled at the thought of ingesting blood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in your head,\u201d Torque had told her just that morning. \u201cHave a taste and you\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>He was kind and considerate to her, as was Syre, but she felt like an imposter. As comfortable as she\u2019d felt with Adrian, she felt equally awkward with the vampires. They didn\u2019t know she\u2019d spent the majority of her life hunting their kind. They didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t going to stop until she took out Vashti.</p> <p>That slaying would mark the end of her life, she was pretty sure. They\u2019d kill her then and that would be a blessing. There was nothing left for her anymore. Her parents were dead, she had to suck on veins to live, and Adrian would hate her if he saw her. He\u2019d killed Shadoe\u2014the woman he had loved to obsession and fallen from grace for\u2014rather than see her become a vampire.</p><p>Outside the room, the wind moaned along the open hallway circling the inner atrium. The plaintive sound broke her heart\u2014Adrian was in mourning, too.</p><p>The maid hurried out of the suite as if the hounds of hell were breathing down her neck. She couldn\u2019t fail to feel the tension in the room. Lindsay wondered what the woman would do if she knew she was being contemplated as a great afternoon snack.</p><p>As the door began to swing closed, it was suddenly thrust inward again. Vash strode in on four-inch-heeled boots as if she were queen of the world.</p><p>Lindsay felt bloodlust and aggression explode inside her. Her nostrils flared, her eyes zeroing in on the woman she\u2019d been waiting forever to kill. Her senses were so powerful now they overwhelmed her, but she wouldn\u2019t get the opportunity to grow into them. She\u2019d be permanently out of commission in about thirty minutes.</p><p>Vash tossed her long hair over her shoulder and shot a glance at Lindsay. She froze when their gazes met, her face taking on a look of disgruntled resignation.</p><p>\u201cAw, shit,\u201d she muttered, the instant before Lindsay launched herself across the room.</p><p>She tackled the vamp into the love seat, narrowly missing Syre, who darted up and out of the way with impossible speed. The sofa snapped down the middle, folding around them like a taco. Sandwiched in the middle, Vash could do little to protect her jugular. With canines extended, Lindsay bit deep. Her fist pierced the cushions of the love seat, her hand searching for a length of broken wood from the frame. Vash writhed beneath her, cursing in a gurgling voice.</p> <p>The vampress\u2019s memories hit Lindsay with the force of Niagara Falls\u2014Vash\u2019s history, carried in her Fallen blood. The life force both Sentinels and the Fallen needed to survive.</p><p>Lindsay released her in a rush, stumbling backward to sit heavily atop the coffee table. She wiped her bloodied mouth with the back of her hand and felt the room spin from the rush of feeding and the surprise of discovering Vash\u2019s innocence.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you!\u201d She gripped her pounding skull, feeling dizzy and disoriented by the onslaught of eons of recollections that didn\u2019t include her mother\u2019s death.</p><p>Vash regained her footing, one hand pressed to her spurting throat. \u201cThat\u2019s your second free pass, you crazy bitch. Next time you come at me, it\u2019ll cost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Lindsay muttered, crushed by the realization that she was once again facing the task of finding a needle in a haystack. Subsiding on blood for years while she did so held no appeal. She\u2019d become the monster she hunted, and while she searched for her mother\u2019s killer it would be the sickest hypocrisy to do to others what had been done to her. \u201cDo me a favor and put me out of my misery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking A,\u201d Vash said, just before nailing Lindsay in the head with a roundhouse kick.</p><p>Lindsay never saw the carpeted floor rushing up to meet her.</p><p>Adrian tossed his duffel bag on his bed and freed his wings, stretching them in an effort to ease the debilitating tension gripping his shoulders. He was heading toward his bathroom for a shower when a knock came to his open bedroom door.</p><p>Pausing, he faced Oliver, who looked as grim as every other face he\u2019d seen over the last three days. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to want to deal with this, Captain.\u201d</p><p>The graveness of Oliver\u2019s tone renewed the painful tautness in Adrian\u2019s spine. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are vampires at the gate.\u201d</p><p>Seething, Adrian exited onto the deck and flew to the end of the driveway, setting down just in front of the wrought-iron barrier. The guardhouse was empty, his property devoid of lycan presence. His solitary approach was reckless and foolhardy, displaying how little value he placed on his own life at the moment.</p><p>A town car with dark window tinting waited out on the main road, its nose already pointed back down the hill. Torque stood on the other side of the gate, along with Raze.</p><p>\u201cWhere are your dogs, Adrian?\u201d Raze growled. The massive vampire\u2019s lip curled as he surveyed the view from behind dark sunglasses.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need them to deal with you.\u201d</p><p>Torque rocked back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019ve got a present for you.\u201d</p><p>Foreboding spread with icy tendrils across Adrian\u2019s skin, but he affected boredom and said evenly, \u201cUnless it\u2019s Lindsay Gibson, I don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. And she\u2019s dying.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s pulse skipped with life for the first time in days. Torque would not have brought Shadoe here. Only Lindsay\u2014a woman Syre had no real connection to. But still, Adrian had to be sure. \u201cShadoe?\u201d</p><p>Torque shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019s gone. And Lindsay won\u2019t feed. Aside from a chunk she tore out of Vash, she hasn\u2019t drunk a drop. Her heartbeat has slowed to the point where I thought she was already dead by the time we got up here.\u201d</p><p>Adrian was over the gate and ripping the door off the car before Torque could say more. Lindsay lay across the backseat, her once golden skin now pale as alabaster. He shielded her from the sun with his wings, completely disregarding the easy target he presented with his back to two vampires. She was still as death, her chest barely moving.</p><p>\u201cSyre returns her to you in honor of Shadoe,\u201d Torque said quietly. \u201cShe carried Shadoe\u2019s soul. We owe her something for that, and you get to collect.\u201d</p><p>Reaching in, Adrian shrouded her with the blanket tangled around her limp body and pulled her from the car. He held her close against him, then flew up and over the gate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d Raze yelled after him, but Adrian was already rushing into the house.</p><p>He took her to his bedroom and tucked her into the bed, willing the drapes shut to block out the sun. Lindsay was as cold as refrigerated marble, and just as lifeless. He shed their clothes with a thought and crawled in beside her, pulling her close to impart the heat from his body. A violent shiver moved through him as her chilled frame pressed against his.</p><p>\u201cLindsay,\u201d he whispered, burying his lips in her crown. She smelled wonderful, and he breathed her in with a shuddering inhale. Tears wet his face and her hair, the quiet of his room shattered by the serrated noises spilling unchecked from his aching throat.</p><p>He pulled back enough to examine her, his shaking hand pushing wayward curls away from her face. Her bloodless lips were slightly parted, revealing the tiniest tip of fang. His heart squeezed in his chest. \u201cNeshama, don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>Adrian pushed his finger into her mouth, slicing the pad with the point of a razor-sharp canine. He slid the bleeding digit deep and stroked it across her tongue. \u201cFeed,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cFeed or you will die, and kill me with you.\u201d</p><p>He waited endless moments. When she didn\u2019t move, Adrian withdrew and slit the pad of a second fingertip, pushing both bleeding fingers into the cool recesses of her mouth.</p><p>Her lips quivered.</p><p>\u201cYes, neshama sheli. Drink. Come back to me.\u201d</p><p>A low, thready moan escaped her. Her throat worked on a tiny swallow.</p><p>\u201cDrink of me,\u201d he urged. \u201cTake what you need.\u201d</p><p>Another soft flex of her throat. Her eyelids fluttered, the skin so translucent he could see the fine network of blue veins coursing through them. They lifted, revealing the amber irises of a vampire. Her gaze was unfocused, her breathing still far too shallow.</p><p>He began to withdraw his fingers, but her tongue moved, pinning them to the roof of her mouth. She was too weak to hold him, and he pulled free, his lips curving with a grim smile when she mewled in protest.</p><p>Turning his head, Adrian traced his bleeding fingers over the thick artery in his neck. Her mouth followed blindly, open and rooting like a hungry babe. He caught the back of her head in his hand and directed her.</p><p>Her tongue licked back and forth over his pulsing vein, plumping it and arousing him in the process. When her fangs pierced his skin, his cock hardened instantly. Her mouth drew on him in rhythmic pulls, sending lust and desire radiating outward from the place where she fed. Her skin began to warm, her body gaining strength with every gulping swallow. Her groan vibrated against him and he jerked with the rush of sensation.</p><p>Lindsay began to rub against him, purring, succumbing to the sexual pleasure vamps found in feeding. Slinging her leg over his, she ground her sex against his thigh, leaving a slick trail of moisture behind.</p><p>He reached for her hips, further aroused by imagining the years ahead, endless days with the woman he loved forever by his side. \u201cPut me inside you, Linds. Ride me till you come.\u201d</p><p>Her fangs slipped free of his skin. \u201cUntil you come,\u201d she breathed, mounting him.</p><p>Her tongue licked across the twin punctures, closing them. Reaching between them, she wrapped her warmed hands around his cock and positioned him at her entrance. She sheathed him in a deft, hard thrust of her hips that made him arch his back with a hiss of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cMy god . . . Adrian.\u201d She nuzzled her temple against his, her breath hot as it blew across his ear. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d</p><p>Then she froze.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t move and barely breathed, Adrian lifted her torso away from his to search her face. \u201cLindsay? What is it?\u201d</p><p>She covered her mouth with her hand, her amber eyes darkening with shock and horror. \u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry, Adrian. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took her face in his hands. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>As she shook her head, her eyes overflowed with pink-tinged tears. Her arms covered her breasts, a display of shame he couldn\u2019t bear to see. Her tight, wet sex slid upward along his cock when she moved to leave him. \u201cI\u2019ve changed. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>Adrian rolled and pinned her beneath him. \u201cI want you more now than I ever have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I can. I do.\u201d He captured her arms above her head and kneed her thighs wider. He withdrew from her clinging depths with exquisite leisure, torturing them both. Then he hammered into her with a quick, hard thrust.</p><p>She gasped, her eyes wide and beautiful. A vampire\u2019s eyes, with Lindsay\u2019s pure, selfless soul shining behind them. Eyes that saw him as clearly in the darkness of his shrouded room as he saw her.</p><p>He pulled back and thrust again. \u201cThe feel of you feeding from my neck has me so damn hot for you. Feel how thick I am? How hard you\u2019ve made me? You turn me inside out.\u201d</p><p>Her thighs tightened around his hips, clasping him sweetly.</p><p>His eyes closed in gratitude at her acceptance. Hunger curled like heated iron around his spine, and he groaned. The feel of her was so sublime it burned through him, restoring life to him just as his blood had done for her. \u201cWhat you are doesn\u2019t matter to me. It never will. It\u2019s who you are that I love.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers dug into the backs of his hands, bringing a sharp bite of pain as newly formed claws pierced his flesh. That turned him on, too. His cock lengthened with his appreciation, filling her until she writhed. He was home, his soul completed by the proximity of hers\u2014his Lindsay, so brave and selfless.</p><p>Enraptured by the feel of her beneath him, around him, he drove into her with powerful lunges. He watched the pleasure weight her eyelids and slacken her lush mouth. His wings spread out and away from the bed, quivering with the raging desire that built with every deep thrust. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t live without you,\u201d he growled. \u201cI won\u2019t let you make me do so.\u201d</p><p>She arched into his pounding hips, her sleek body even more powerful than before. Strong enough to take everything he had to give her and still demand more. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Rearing back, Adrian yanked her up. He rested on his heels and urged her to rock against him. \u201cFuck me, Linds. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her silken arms around his neck and tucked her knees on either side of his. Thrusting her hips, she rode him, taking him swift and hard with fluidly graceful undulations.</p> <p>She was formidable now and she devastated him with pleasure. The rhythmic slap of her pelvis against his was so erotic, he bit his lower lip to hold off the onslaught of orgasm. Not yet . . . Too soon . . . Make it last . . .</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>He caught her nape in his hand, pulling her mouth to his. Their lips sealed, their panting breaths mingling as they climaxed together. Quaking with the power of it. Shaken by the pure, unadulterated connection between them. No restraints.</p><p>At last.</p><p>\u201cElijah, too?\u201d Lindsay asked, her fingers stroking across Adrian\u2019s chest. \u201cHe went with them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis body wasn\u2019t among the dead, so I assume so, yes.\u201d</p><p>That hurt her. Elijah\u2019s actions could very well pit him against the man she loved. She thought of the message the lycan had left on her phone, the date of his call falling after the uprising. He wanted to see her, asked for her help. And because he was her friend, she wanted to give it to him. She was divided on all sides, beholden to damn near everyone for saving her ass at some point or other. \u201cWhat will we do?\u201d</p><p>Turning his head, Adrian pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cWe recuperate and regroup. Then we assess the damage and start rebuilding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there are so few of you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do it.\u201d He sounded so sure.</p><p>\u201cHow well do you trust your Sentinels?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith my life.\u201d</p><p>She blew out her breath. \u201cThe person who snatched me from the Point and took me to Syre . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201c. . . sported wings.\u201d</p><p>Adrian jerked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She attempted to soothe him with soft strokes of her hand over his chest. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a look at who it was. I was knocked out from behind with some kind of Vulcan neck squeeze.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a long time, but the turmoil he felt was reflected in the howling winds that surrounded the house.</p><p>\u201cYou hide your emotions so well,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut the weather gives you away.\u201d</p> <p>He looked down at her with widened eyes. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the weather in you. I\u2019m kinda attuned to that sort of thing. I feel emotions through the wind. It\u2019s like it talks to me. It used to warn me about inhumans, too, but I sense the differences on my own now. I guess my weather radar was truly mine and not an echo of Shadoe\u2019s abilities.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved in one of his rare full smiles.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lindsay was dazzled by that smile, and curious about its cause.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve prayed for a sign\u2014any sign at all\u2014that the Creator would absolve me of guilt for falling in love. When the weather began to respond to my moods, I thought it was to remind me of my shortcomings. But perhaps it was the sign I asked for, a gift to bring you to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd hopeful, which I need right now. We all do.\u201d</p><p>She hugged him. \u201cWhen I was younger, I used to think my sixth sense made me a freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It makes you mine.\u201d</p><p>They lay in silence for a while. Lindsay almost dozed, lulled by the steady cadence of Adrian\u2019s heartbeat and the feel of his warm, solid body pressed against hers.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss her?\u201d she asked after a while.</p><p>His chest expanded on a deep breath. He didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand. \u201cI should\u2014I owe her that much\u2014but it\u2019s been so long, and I need you so much. It\u2019s hard to see past you. Although, to be honest, I\u2019m not trying very hard. I love the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay if you do think of her. I told her I wouldn\u2019t hold it against you if you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spoke to her?\u201d</p><p>Lindsay set her hands atop the tight lacing of muscle that crisscrossed his abdomen, then set her chin upon them. \u201cShe was going to keep you. She was a pro at dealing with all those past lives and memories, while I was drowning in them. I had to fight for you.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes flamed with the heat of his emotions. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right? After all the times I tried to push you away, I finally realized I couldn\u2019t live\u2014or die\u2014without you. So I told her if she kept you, I\u2019d still always have some part of you and she\u2019d have to share. Apparently, she decided she\u2019d rather have you be with me and think about her, than be with her while thinking about me.\u201d</p><p>Adrian\u2019s smile curled her toes. \u201cThat sounds like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful,\u201d she admitted. \u201cShe gave up her soul so I could keep mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will love her for that forever. But you have my heart and soul, Lindsay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>After a drawn out moment, he exhaled audibly. \u201cMaybe this . . . experience was good for her, too. Shadoe wasn\u2019t a bad person, but she wasn\u2019t one to sacrifice her desires for the good of others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking she matured over countless lifetimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think so. For her sake.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay looked down at her fingers as she traced the faint line of dark hair that bisected his abs and led to delicious places below. After everything he had been through and everything he\u2019d lost, Adrian still had it in him to search for silver linings. She loved him for that, and countless other things. \u201cI told her I\u2019d take whatever I can get when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>He twisted deftly, caging her beneath him. Framed by his unfurling wings, he was darkly handsome. Breathtaking. \u201cThen you\u2019d best be prepared to take all of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, neshama.\u201d She slid her arms around his neck. \u201cAll of you. Always.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>\u201cAs I feared,\u201d Damien said, \u201cwe\u2019ve lost the Andover and Forest River packs. We\u2019re keeping a lid on the others for now, but if we\u2019re attacked from the outside while battling mutiny on the inside, more will fall.\u201d</p><p>Adrian stood at the railing of the wraparound deck and watched his Sentinels exercise their wings in the air above him. The early-morning sky of pink and gray was giving way to a soft powder blue. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to find a way to be more resourceful. In the interim, the illness is spreading through the vampire ranks like wildfire. Perhaps all we really have to do is sit and wait. I won\u2019t count on it, but it\u2019s a possibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re better today,\u201d Damien noted.</p><p>\u201cStronger,\u201d he agreed. \u201cHappier. Ready to take on the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sex talking.\u201d</p><p>Adrian turned at the sound of Lindsay\u2019s voice, finding her standing a few feet away. She reached over her head and pushed up to her tiptoes, stretching her lovely lithe body\u2014much to his delight.</p><p>She straightened and wrinkled her nose at Damien. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I really don\u2019t mean to flaunt the rules and be disrespectful. It\u2019s just that\u2019s such a guy thing to say the morning after he doesn\u2019t let his girlfriend get any sleep.\u201d</p><p>Morning after . . .</p><p>Adrian looked up at the sun in the sky, then shot a look at Damien, whose mouth hung slightly ajar. Lindsay seemed oblivious to the fact that she was standing in sunlight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get back into training,\u201d she went on. \u201cI\u2019m going to need it so I can cover your ass and find the vamps who killed my mother. I\u2019m not giving up on hunting those fuckers down and making them pay. And I need to know for sure what happened with my dad. If there\u2019s a score to settle there, I have to know. If it was truly just an accident, I need to know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you require, neshama,\u201d Adrian assured her, concealing his astonishment.</p><p>Damien leaned closer and spoke under his breath. \u201cShe should be on fire in this level of sunlight. How is it possible that she\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>Adrian sat on the railing and watched Lindsay go through an elaborate and unwittingly sexy calisthenics routine. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I suspect my blood has something to do with it. Much like Fallen blood conveys a temporary immunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther vamps have bitten Sentinels before. They weren\u2019t then able to practice yoga on an uncovered deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only Lindsay has drunk Sentinel blood exclusively after being turned by one of the Fallen. Every cell in her body is nourished by blood that protects her. As long as she continues to drink from me, she might keep the benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA minion with the gifts of the Fallen.\u201d Damien lifted a hand to his brow, as if pained. \u201cIf Sentinel blood cures the vampire disease and imparts immunity to the healthy, and others were to learn of this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014we\u2019d be hunted to extinction. I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout the lycans, we\u2019re sitting ducks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSiobh\u00e1n is testing whether lycan blood is an alternative. They were once seraphim, too.\u201d</p><p>Damien was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019ll pray for a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPray for us all.\u201d Adrian set his hands on the railing and tipped his face up to the sun. The morning breeze blew across his feathers in a soft greeting from the new day. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need it.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
