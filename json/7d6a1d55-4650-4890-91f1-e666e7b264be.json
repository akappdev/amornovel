When they realized the surviving Blood were stunned by the violent loss of Queens and courts, they rebelled\u2014and decided that dying by the thousands was an acceptable price to pay in order to wipe out the Blood in Dena Nehele.</p><p>So the landens died during those first days of the uprising. Oh, how they died.</p><p>But so did the Blood.</p><p>The males in the Blood\u2019s towns and villages died as they exhausted the power that made the Blood who and what they were, until even the ones who wore Jewels and had a reservoir of power had used up everything they had in the effort to defend the women and children who didn\u2019t have the strength or skill to defend themselves.</p><p>When that power that lived within them was gone, they fought with weapons like any other man. But the landens kept coming, kept fighting\u2014and the Blood, outnumbered, had no chance of surviving.</p> <p>Women and children died, along with the men. The landens, steeped in their hatred for the Blood, set fire to the buildings, turning entire villages into funeral pyres.</p><p>Then the rogues, trained warriors who had refused to serve any Queen, came down from the mountains\u2014and the battle for Dena Nehele really began.</p><p>He rode with one pack of rogues, a leader committed to slaughter in order to defend what was left of his people. But as they reached a walled estate on their way to the town that served as Dena Nehele\u2019s capital, he pulled his horse aside and stared through the iron bars of a double gate at the big stone mansion.</p><p>Grayhaven.</p><p>It was his family name. This was his family\u2019s home.</p><p>He had never lived in that mansion because the Queens who had controlled Dena Nehele had claimed it for their own residence, their own seat of power. And like the rest of the Territory, the house and the land had declined under the rule of bitches who had stood in the shadow of Dorothea SaDiablo, the High Priestess of Hayll.</p> <p>He had grown up in the mountain camps ruled by the rogues because he was the last of his line, the last direct descendant of Lord Jared and Lady Lia, the Queen who, like her grandmother before her, had been called \u201cthe Gray Lady.\u201d And if there was any truth to the family stories, he was the last person capable of finding the key that would reveal a treasure great enough to restore Dena Nehele.</p><p>Lord Jared had told his grandsons about the treasure the Gray Lady and Thera, a powerful Black Widow, had hidden somewhere around Grayhaven. While the family still lived in the house, every male had searched for it, and the story had spread to trusted advisers who shouldn\u2019t have been trusted. When the family line failed to produce even a minor Queen, Dorothea\u2019s pet Queens had descended on Dena Nehele like scavengers fighting over a fresh carcass. What was left of his family abandoned Grayhaven and spoke the family name only in secret.</p><p>Generations had tried to hold on to something that was Dena Nehele, that was the Blood as they had been when the Gray Lady had ruled. Generations of the Grayhaven line had been \u201cbroken into service\u201d as a way of keeping the people yoked to the rule of unworthy Queens.</p><p>Generations of suffering\u2014until that witch storm swept through Terreille. A fast, violent storm, terrible in its cleansing, it had swept away Dorothea SaDiablo and everyone who had been tainted by her, but it had left the surviving Blood prey to the landens\u2019 hatred.</p><p>\u201cTheran!\u201d one of the Warlords shouted. \u201cThe bastards have set fire to the south end of the town!\u201d</p><p>He wanted to ride through those gates, wanted to protect the only thing left of his own heritage. But he had been trained to fight, had been born to stand on a killing field. So he turned away from the house and land he wanted to reclaim.</p><p>But as he rode away, he promised himself that when the fires of rebellion were finally smothered, he would come back to his family\u2019s home.</p><p>If there was anything left.</p> <p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>present</p><p>Reaching the broken-down stone wall and the double gate that was half-torn from its hinges, Theran Grayhaven planted his feet in the exact spot where he\u2019d stood two years before. Now, finally, the landen uprising had been completely smothered, and the Blood\u2014those who were left\u2014could set about the business of trying to restore their land and their people.</p><p>If there was any way of restoring their people.</p><p>\u201cSince you invited them here, you\u2019re going to feel like a fool if you\u2019re still standing at the gate when the other Warlord Princes arrive.\u201d</p><p>Theran looked over his shoulder. He hadn\u2019t heard the other man approach, hadn\u2019t felt a warning presence. Even a month ago, being that careless would have gotten him killed.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be up before sunset,\u201d Theran said. \u201cIt drains you too much.\u201d</p><p>The old man scowled at the wall and the gate\u2014and all the other signs of neglect. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need blood tonight.\u201d</p><p>The scowl deepened. \u201cI\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalon . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be using that voice on me, boy. I can still whack some sense into that stubborn head of yours.\u201d</p><p>Talon was a grizzled warrior who was missing two fingers on his left hand and half his right foot\u2014evidence of the price paid for the battles won. He was also a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince. Since Theran was a Warlord Prince who wore Green Jewels,Talon was the only man in Dena Nehele who was strong enough to \u201cwhack some sense\u201d into him.</p><p>But only after the sun set.</p><p>Talon was demon-dead. If he was forced to act during daylight hours, his strength drained at a terrifying speed.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever wonder if it was worth it?\u201d Theran asked, looking away from the man who had raised him.</p><p>He had never known his father. The man had mated to continue the Grayhaven bloodline and had been caught, broken, and completely destroyed before Theran had been born.</p><p>When he was seven, his mother had brought him to the mountain camps to keep the Grayhaven line safe from Dorothea\u2019s pet Queens.</p><p>He never saw her again.</p><p>Talon looked at the mansion and shook his head. \u201cI was in this fight for three hundred years, give or take a few. I knew Lia, and I knew Grizelle before her. I stood with Jared and Blaed when we were all among the living\u2014and I stood with others when I became demon-dead. So I never wondered if bringing Dena Nehele back to the way it was when the Gray Ladies ruled was worth the blood and pain and lives that were lost. I knew getting that back was worth the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t win, Talon,\u201d Theran said softly. \u201cSomeone else eliminated the enemy, but we still didn\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Grayhaven is standing once more on the family land. That\u2019s a start. And there is a marker on the table.\u201d</p><p>A marker Talon hadn\u2019t told him about until a few days ago. \u201cA dangerous one, assuming the man who owes us a favor is still alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to win unless we gamble,\u201d Talon said. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll bring the Coach onto the grounds and camp out here tonight. Tomorrow you can go through the house and see what needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky if we find anything intact,\u201d Theran said bitterly. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the bitches who ruled from here not trying to find the treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the key wasn\u2019t in the house,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the legend. And without the key that begins unlocking the spells, they could have ripped up every floorboard and knocked down every brick in every fireplace, and they still wouldn\u2019t have found the treasure even if they were looking right at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to find a safe floor or a working fireplace,\u201d Theran grumbled.</p><p>\u201cDo your pissing and moaning later,\u201d Talon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got company. I\u2019ll fetch the Coach. You give yourself a kick in the ass and get up to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Surrogate father and protector of the Grayhaven line, Talon had held him when he\u2019d cried and hadn\u2019t hesitated to give him a smack when it was deserved\u2014at least, deserved according to Talon. Everything good that he knew about the Blood, about honor and Protocol and what a Warlord Prince should be, he had learned from a man who remembered Dena Nehele as it had been. Who remembered what it meant to have honor. To wear, as Talon put it, the Invisible Ring.</p><p>Bracing himself for the discussion ahead, Theran strode toward the mansion.</p><p>Was the honey pear tree still in the back gardens somewhere? Could the tree have survived that many centuries? There had been a few honey pear trees growing in one of the rogue camps low in the mountains, and there was a grove of them\u2014or so he\u2019d heard\u2014tucked away in the southern part of Dena Nehele, in one of the Shalador reserves. Having heard stories about Jared\u2019s mother growing the honey pear trees for her sons and how Jared had gifted Lia with his tree and given another to Thera and Blaed, he\u2019d been disappointed when he\u2019d finally gotten to taste one of the hard little fruits. But Talon said the trees didn\u2019t grow well in the mountains, that something they needed was lacking, and that was the reason the fruit didn\u2019t taste right.</p><p>Well, the trees weren\u2019t the only things that had felt a need that had gone unanswered.</p><p>Talon set the Coach down on the scrubby front lawn, while Theran watched the Warlord Princes appear near the gate as they dropped from the Winds, those webs of psychic roadways that allowed the Blood to travel through the Darkness.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until Talon limped over to join him that the first Warlord Princes came through the gate, walking up the weedy drive in pairs, the lightest-Jeweled males coming first.</p><p>*I count about a hundred,* Talon said on a psychic thread.</p><p>*That\u2019s probably every Warlord Prince left in Dena Nehele,* Theran replied.</p><p>*Probably. And a better response than I\u2019d hoped for.* </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What wasn\u2019t said was that only a handful of those men wore an Opal that was considered a dark Jewel. He and Talon, wearing Green and Sapphire, were the strongest males in the Territory. Everyone else wore lighter Jewels.</p><p>They formed a semicircle around him and Talon, the lighter Jewels leaving spaces so the darker-Jeweled males could stand in the front.</p><p>Except for one Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince who stood apart from the others\u2014a Prince whose golden brown skin marked him as having a Shalador bloodline. Maybe even being pure Shalador.</p><p>Lord Jared\u2019s coloring. Lord Jared\u2019s race.</p> <p>Theran resisted the urge to look at his own hand and see the similarities.</p><p>\u201cWould you care to join us, Prince Ranon?\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cI can hear from where I\u2019m standing,\u201d was the chilly reply.</p><p>Talon nodded as if the less-than-courteous response made no difference.</p><p>Prince Archerr, another who wore Opal Jewels, stepped forward. \u201cYou called us here, and we answered. But none of us can afford to be gone long. The landens have to be held on a tight leash, and some of us are the only trained warrior left in our piece of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p> <p>Theran nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019ll come to the point. We need a Queen.\u201d</p><p>A moment of disbelieving silence before several men made derisive sounds.</p><p>\u201cTell us something we don\u2019t know,\u201d Spere said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got Queens, more or less,\u201d Archerr said.</p><p>\u201cWould you serve any of them?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen the sun shines in Hell.\u201d</p> <p>Mutters with an undercurrent of anger.</p><p>\u201cWe have Queens,\u201d Theran said. \u201cWomen who, even in their prime, weren\u2019t considered strong enough to be a concern to the Queens who whored for Dorothea SaDiablo. And we have Queens who are still little girls, barely old enough to begin training in basic Craft. And we have a handful who are adolescents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne being a fifteen-year-old who\u2019s turning into such a ripe bitch she may not live long enough to be sixteen,\u201d Archerr said bitterly.</p><p>\u201cWe need a Queen who knows how to be a Queen,\u201d Theran said. \u201cWe need a Queen who could rule Dena Nehele in the same tradition as the Gray Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find one of those within our own borders,\u201d Spere said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019ve all been looking? And if you look beyond our borders to find a Queen mature enough to rule, the males in that Territory aren\u2019t going to give up anyone good. And since I live in a village along the western border, I can tell you the Territories west of us aren\u2019t doing any better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Theran replied.</p><p>\u201cThen where are we supposed to find a Queen?\u201d Archerr asked.</p><p>\u201cIn Kaeleer.\u201d</p> <p>Silence. Not even embarrassed coughs or shuffling feet.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way into Kaeleer except through the service fairs,\u201d Shaddo said. \u201cAt least, no other way to get into the Shadow Realm and stay alive long enough to state your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is,\u201d Theran said, grateful that he and Talon had considered this possibility. \u201cSomeone goes to the Black Mountain.\u201d</p><p>Ninety-eight men stared at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd does what?\u201d Archerr asked quietly.</p><p>Theran glanced at Talon, who nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s a Warlord Prince who owes my family a favor.\u201d That wasn\u2019t exactly the way Talon had phrased it. More like, For Jared\u2019s sake and memory, he might be willing to do the family a favor. \u201cIf I can find him . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think this Prince can get us a Queen from Kaeleer?\u201d Shaddo asked. \u201cWho has that kind of influence and power?\u201d</p><p>Theran took a deep breath. \u201cDaemon Sadi.\u201d</p><p>Ninety-eight Warlord Princes shivered.</p><p>\u201cThe Sadist owes your family a favor?\u201d Archerr asked.</p><p>Theran nodded.</p><p>A dozen voices muttered,\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalon and I talked it over and figured asking at the Keep is the simplest way of finding out if anyone knows where Sadi is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could be dead,\u201d Spere said, sounding a little hopeful. \u201cHis brother disappeared years ago, didn\u2019t he? Maybe Sadi got caught in that storm like the rest of the Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Talon said. \u201cAnd maybe he\u2019s no longer among the living. But even if he\u2019s demon-dead, he still might be able to help. And if he\u2019s among the demon-dead who went to the Dark Realm, going to the Keep is still our best chance of finding him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if we do get a Queen from Kaeleer?\u201d Shaddo asked.</p><p>\u201cThen at least twelve males have to be willing to serve her and form her First Circle,\u201d Theran said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to form a court. Some of us will have to serve.\u201d The next words stuck in his throat, but on this too, he and Talon had agreed. \u201cAnd Grayhaven will be offered as her place of residence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say we\u2019ll have to form a court,\u201d Ranon said, still sounding cold. \u201cWill Shalador be asked to serve? Will Shalador be allowed to serve? Or will the blood that also flows through your veins, Prince Theran, be held to the reserves, ignored unless we\u2019re needed for fodder?\u201d</p><p>Before anyone could draw a line and start a fight that would end with someone dying, Talon raised his hand, commanding their attention.</p><p>\u201cThat will be up to the Queen, Ranon,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to hone the blade and offer her our throats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping we won\u2019t end up with someone who will crush what is left of us?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cHoping exactly that,\u201d Talon replied.</p><p>A long silence. Ranon took a step back, then hesitated. \u201cIf a Kaeleer Queen comes to Dena Nehele, some of the Shalador people will offer themselves for her pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Talon looked thoughtful as they all watched Ranon walk back to the gate. Nothing was said until the Shalador Warlord Prince caught one of the Winds and vanished.</p><p>\u201cIf you can get a Queen from Kaeleer . . .\u201d Archerr didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send a message,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>The Warlord Princes retreated to the gate. No breaking into groups, no talking among themselves. Some looked back at him and Talon.</p><p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019re going to the Keep,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Theran nodded as he watched the last man vanish. \u201cWhich do you think worries them more? That I won\u2019t be able to find Sadi\u2014or that I will?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Cassidy sat back on her heels and brushed her chin with the tail of her long red braid.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said as she considered the ground in front of her. \u201cDoes the rock stay or does the rock go?\u201d</p><p>Since the question had been offered to the air and the patch of garden in front of her, she didn\u2019t expect an answer. Besides, it wasn\u2019t really her decision. She\u2019d volunteered to clear the weeds out of this bed as a way to have something to do\u2014and a way to work with a little piece of land. But this was her mother\u2019s garden, and whether the rock was an unwanted obstacle or a desired, important part of the whole depended on how one looked at it.</p><p>Which was true of so many things.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s done and can\u2019t be undone,\u201d she muttered. \u201cSo enjoy your visit here, do what you can, and let the rest go.\u201d</p><p>Let the rest go. How long would it take before her heart let go of the humiliation?</p><p>\u201cWell, at least I found out before I put in all the spring work on those g-gardens.\u201d Her voice wobbled and tears blurred her vision.</p><p>Swallowing the hurt that wanted to spill out every moment she didn\u2019t keep her feelings chained, she reviewed the containers of seeds she had collected last year from the Queen\u2019s garden in Bhak. That garden wasn\u2019t hers anymore, so her mother would benefit by having a few new plants this year.</p><p>\u201cYour mother said I\u2019d find you here.\u201d</p><p>The voice, always rough because the vocal cords had been damaged in a boyhood accident, made her smile as she looked over her shoulder at the burly man walking toward her.</p><p>Burly in body, Burle by name. A simple man. A handyman. Twice each month he would stay at a landen village for three days and take jobs to fix whatever needed fixing. Most Blood thought it was beneath a Warlord\u2019s dignity to work for landens\u2014even if the Warlord wore a Jewel as light as Tiger Eye. He\u2019d always said,\u201cWork is work, and the marks they pay me with are as good as any that come from some snot-nosed aristo family.\u201d</p><p>That attitude didn\u2019t get him work in houses owned by Blood aristos here in Weavers Field, their home village, or in other nearby Blood villages, but the rest of the Blood didn\u2019t care what Burle said about aristos, and the landens liked having that little bit extra that came from a man who could use some Craft along with a hammer and didn\u2019t talk down to them. The fact that Lord Burle always gave them that little bit extra\u2014and more\u2014meant he had as much work as he wanted.</p><p>Her heart warmed to see him\u2014and a moment later began hammering with alarm. \u201cWhy are you home? Is something wrong?\u201d</p><p>Burle made a show of looking at the sky before focusing on his daughter. \u201cWell, Kitten, it\u2019s midday. Food\u2019s on the table. You\u2019re still out here. Your mother has that look. You know that look?\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. She knew that look.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Burle continued, \u201cI was sent out to fetch you.\u201d</p><p>Not likely. Sent out, maybe. But not to fetch her. She loved her mother, Devra, but there were some things she could say only to her father. She just wasn\u2019t ready to say them.</p><p>\u201cAll right, Father. What are you up to?\u201d She put enough emphasis on the word \u201cFather\u201d to tell him she knew he was up to something. When the only response she got was his frowning at her under those bushy eyebrows her mother subtly kept subdued with grooming Craft, she tried not to sigh as she said,\u201cPoppi.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, satisfied that he\u2019d made his point. \u201cYour mother said you came out here right after breakfast. Seemed like a long time to be digging up weeds, so I thought I\u2019d give you a hand. But it looks like you\u2019ve got that bed in good order.\u201d He frowned at the gloves lying on the ground beside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassidy held up her hands. \u201cI wore the heavy gloves. I used a tight shield to protect the palms. And I used a little Craft to turn over the bits of the garden that were obstinate.\u201d And if it really was midday, she\u2019d spent far more time staring at nothing and trying not to think than she\u2019d spent on actual labor.</p><p>Burle crouched beside her, took her hands in his, and studied her palms. \u201cNothing wrong with a few calluses, but a hand that\u2019s torn up can\u2019t serve.\u201d He gave her hands a gentle squeeze and let go. \u201cStill, you didn\u2019t need to do all of this yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father taught me that there was nothing wrong with hard work or sweat.\u201d</p> <p>Laughing, he stood up, bringing her with him. \u201cI used to wonder if your brother, Clayton, heard half of what I said. And I used to worry that you heard too much.\u201d He rested a hand on her shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a good woman, Kitten. And you\u2019re a good Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Queen?\u201d Control broke, and the pain she\u2019d been living with since she\u2019d shown up at her parents\u2019 house the week before flooded out of her. \u201cPoppi, my entire court resigned. All the males in my First Circle\u2014all twelve of them, including the Steward and Master of the Guard\u2014informed me that they wanted to serve another Queen\u2014a Queen who had served her apprenticeship in my court. She was their choice. For everything. For everything, Poppi.\u201d</p><p>She sobbed out all the hurt, the shock of betrayal. Only bad Queens were abandoned. Only abusive Queens had their First Circle walk away, breaking the court. Only . . .</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think about the man who had been her Consort. That hurt went too deep.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t pretty. Had never been pretty. She was tall, big-boned, and gawky. She had red hair and freckles, and a long, plain face. She didn\u2019t come from a wealthy family or an aristo family. Except for a distant cousin, Aaron, who was the Warlord Prince of Tajrana and was married to the Queen of Nharkhava, there was no social status connected with knowing her or being in her bed. And since she wore a Rose Jewel, she didn\u2019t have the kind of power that would intrigue anyone. There was no reason for anyone to look twice at her.</p> <p>Except that she was a Queen, an oddity in a family that had rarely produced anyone who wore a dark Jewel, let alone someone who was in the most powerful caste\u2014the ruling caste.</p><p>Now she was a Queen without a court. She felt as if something had been ripped out of her, and she didn\u2019t know how to stanch the emotional wound. Lady Kermilla had the First Circle who had served her, the Blood and landen villages she had ruled, the house she had lived in, and the gardens she had tended.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t wanted to be important, hadn\u2019t wanted to become a Province Queen and rule over District Queens. And she certainly had no ambitions to become the Queen of the whole Territory of Dharo. She\u2019d been happy ruling Bhak and Woolskin. She had wanted to make her piece of Dharo a good place to live for Blood and landens alike.</p><p>But the males who had served her had seen her court as a stepping-stone to serving in more influential courts ruled by stronger Queens. When they realized she wasn\u2019t going to be a stepping-stone to anything, they grimly fulfilled their contracts\u2014and walked away from her and straight into a contract with Kermilla, a pretty, vivacious Queen who was ready to establish her first court. Kermilla wore Summer-sky, which wasn\u2019t a dark enough Jewel to be a big lure, but she had some social connections, could dazzle stronger males without offending . . . and was twenty-one years old.</p><p>\u201cThere now, Kitten,\u201d Burle said as he patted her back. \u201cDon\u2019t take on so. It\u2019s no shame on you that you ended up with a First Circle who has to drop their pants in order to use their brains.\u201d</p><p>The image that popped into Cassidy\u2019s head stopped the flow of tears. Made her hiccup. Ended with a watery giggle.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s better.\u201d Burle called in a neatly folded handkerchief. \u201cMop up or you\u2019ll end up on the sofa with bags of salad over your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a slice of cucumber, Poppi. You put a slice of cucumber over your eyes.\u201d Cassidy mopped her face and blew her nose. \u201cMother swears by that remedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d Burle said. \u201cNothing wrong with the way your mother looks. First thing in the morning, last thing at night, and every hour in between, she looks just fine.\u201d</p><p>He meant it. And because he meant it, and because she\u2019d inherited the red hair and freckles from Devra, she\u2019d thought the man who had been her Consort had also meant it when he said he thought she was lovely.</p><p>When he\u2019d left, the bastard had told her what he really thought.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Cassidy said, vanishing the handkerchief, \u201cwe\u2019d best get to the table before Mother comes out here, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we should.\u201d Slinging an arm around her shoulders, Burle aimed them for the house. \u201cI\u2019ll say one more thing. I remember meeting Lady Kermilla when she was serving her apprenticeship in your court, and I\u2019ll tell you this, Kitten. If those fools chose her over you, then they deserve what they\u2019re going to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Probably. When she\u2019d sent Kermilla\u2019s evaluation to the Province Queen, she\u2019d tried to be kind, but there had been no denying that she\u2019d had concerns about Kermilla\u2019s attitude toward anyone who wasn\u2019t strong enough to fight back.</p> <p>\u201cTheir loss, my gain,\u201d Burle said. \u201cI\u2019ve got the two finest women in the whole Territory living in my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a little while,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just visiting, Poppi. Next week, I\u2019ll start looking for a place of my own.\u201d A very simple place, since there hadn\u2019t been much left of the tithes she received from Bhak and Woolskin, not after paying the court expenses and sending the Province Queen her share. That had been her income while she ruled, and the fact that there was any left was due to her careful upbringing and her mother\u2019s firm belief that a good life didn\u2019t have to be an expensive life.</p><p>And since it was her income and what she\u2019d saved from the tithes was all she had, she would continue to tear up Kermilla\u2019s letters, which all asked the same thing: how much was the former Queen of Bhak going to \u201cgift\u201d the new Queen?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re getting your own place?\u201d Burle said. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-one years old, Poppi. A grown woman doesn\u2019t live with her parents.\u201d</p><p>He stopped so fast he pulled her off-balance. \u201cWhy not? What can you do in your own place that you can\u2019t do\u2014?\u201d His face flushed as he came to an obvious\u2014and incorrect\u2014conclusion about what a woman wouldn\u2019t want to do in her parents\u2019 house.</p><p>\u201cWell now,\u201d he muttered, lengthening his stride and pulling her with him. \u201cWe\u2019ll just see what your mother has to say about that. We\u2019ll just see.\u201d</p><p>She already knew what Devra would say, but this wasn\u2019t the time to tell her father he was outnumbered.</p><p>\u201cYes, Poppi,\u201d she said fondly. \u201cWe\u2019ll just see.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>\u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d</p><p>Saetan Daemon SaDiablo, the former Warlord Prince of Dhemlan, glanced at Daemon Sadi, the current Warlord Prince of Dhemlan, and swallowed the urge to laugh. That tone of voice was more suited to a surly adolescent than a strong adult male in his prime, and being Hayllian, one of the long-lived races, Daemon had left adolescence behind several centuries ago.</p><p>But he\u2019d noticed that there were times when Daemon and his brother, Lucivar Yaslana, set adulthood\u2014and a good portion of their brains\u2014aside and were just . . . boys. They seemed to test the emotional waters of adolescence when they were alone with him. Maybe it was because he\u2019d been denied the privilege of raising them and the three of them hadn\u2019t gone through the pissing contests they would have all endured if they\u2019d lived with him. Maybe it was because they\u2019d had to grow up too hard and too fast in order to survive the vicious slavery that had been used to control them. At least, that had attempted to control them. The slavery, the pain, the fear, and the cruelty had turned two young men, two Warlord Princes who were natural predators, into lethally honed weapons.</p><p>They were intelligent and vicious. Loyal and loving. Powerful and independent. Fiercely protective of those they loved to a sometimes annoying degree.</p><p>They were his sons, and he loved them both. But the one standing at the other end of the table, looking at him through long black eyelashes, was his mirror, his true heir. And since he was, among other things, the High Lord of Hell, the fact that Daemon was a mirror was something he never forgot.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d Daemon asked again.</p><p>\u201cBecause when you arrived at the Keep in Kaeleer and discovered I was here at the Keep in Terreille, you came through the Gate to this Realm in order to ask me something about the family estates. And when you saw me sorting reams of old papers, you asked if there was anything you could do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a polite offer, not a sincere one,\u201d Daemon grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Saetan replied dryly. \u201cBut I chose to take the words at face value.\u201d</p><p>Daemon snarled softly and went back to sorting papers.</p><p>Saetan hid a smile and concentrated on clearing out the stacks of papers at his end of the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you planning to do with this?\u201d Daemon asked several minutes later. \u201cBring it back to the Keep in Kaeleer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the name of Hell would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarian says shredded parchment makes a good mulch for flower beds.\u201d</p><p>Marian was Lucivar\u2019s wife, a lovely woman and a talented hearth witch whose gentler nature balanced her husband\u2019s volatile one. But there were times, Saetan felt, when hearth-Craft practicality needed to be put aside for a more direct and simple solution.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to haul this out to one of the stone courtyards, put a shield around it to keep it contained, blast it with witchfire, and transform several wagonloads of useless paper into a barrel of ash.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you asked Marian to help, you\u2019d get this done a lot faster. I bet she knows several \u2018tidy-up\u2019 spells,\u201d Daemon said. Then he paused. Considered. \u201cWell, maybe you wouldn\u2019t get it done faster, but Marian would be thorough.\u201d</p><p>Damn the boy for knowing just where to apply the needle in order to prick and annoy.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t trying to clean the place; he was trying to eliminate reams of history so old it was no longer of any use to anyone\u2014including the long-lived races.</p> <p>Well, two could play the needle game. \u201cIf I wanted things to get interesting, I could ask Jaenelle to help.\u201d</p><p>Daemon looked at the parchment in his hand, tipped it a little closer to the ball of witchlight hovering over the table so he could read the faded script . . . and paled.</p><p>Saetan had no idea what was written on that parchment, but clearly the thought of Jaenelle Angelline, the former Queen of Ebon Askavi and now Daemon\u2019s darling wife, having that information was sufficient to scare a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince.</p><p>Daemon put the paper on the discard pile and quietly cleared his throat. \u201cI think the two of us can take care of this without mentioning it to the Ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise decision.\u201d And the same conclusion he\u2019d come to when he\u2019d decided to clear out some of this stuff.</p> <p>They worked for another hour. Then Saetan said, \u201cThat\u2019s all that can be done today.\u201d</p><p>Daemon looked around. They\u2019d thrown the discarded papers into a large crate, but the table and surrounding floor were still strewn with stacks that hadn\u2019t been touched.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s midday, Prince,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Daemon nodded. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realized it had gotten so late.\u201d</p><p>The hours between sunset and sunrise were the part of the day that belonged to the demon-dead\u2014and Guardians, the ones like Saetan who were the living dead, who straddled a line that extended their lifetimes beyond counting. During the years when Jaenelle had lived with him as his adopted daughter, his habits had changed and his waking hours had extended through the morning so that he would be available to the living. But even here at the Keep, the Sanctuary of Witch, he needed to rest when the sun was at its strongest.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the Keep in Kaeleer,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll wash up, have something to eat before I retire, and you can ask me about whatever you\u2019d originally come here to ask.\u201d</p> <p>The library door opened before they reached it. A Warlord who served the Keep in Terreille nodded to them and said, \u201cHigh Lord, a Warlord Prince has arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t offer it,\u201d the Warlord replied. \u201cAnd he wouldn\u2019t say which Territory he\u2019s from. He says he\u2019s looking for someone, and he insists on talking to \u2018someone in authority.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he?\u201d Saetan said softly. \u201cHow foolish of him. Put our guest in one of the receiving rooms. I\u2019ll be with him shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, High Lord.\u201d</p><p>The Warlord\u2019s look of gleeful anticipation told Saetan how deeply the idiot had offended those who served the Keep by not following the basic courtesies. Fools who tried to withhold their names when asking to speak with someone here were usually given as much as they\u2019d offered\u2014which was nothing.</p><p>When the Warlord left, Saetan turned and touched Daemon\u2019s arm. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to Kaeleer and ask for a meal. I\u2019ll talk to this unknown Prince and join you when I\u2019m done. I doubt this will take more than a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>The air around them chilled\u2014a warning that a violent temper was turning cold, cold, cold.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk to anyone from Terreille, you should have someone watching your back,\u201d Daemon said too softly.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if he should feel flattered or insulted by his son\u2019s desire to protect, but he decided it was best to keep his own temper out of this conversation\u2014especially now that Daemon\u2019s temper had turned lethal. \u201cHave you forgotten that I\u2019m a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince and do know how to defend myself?\u201d</p><p>One sweep of those golden eyes that were now glazed and sleepy. One pointed look at his left hand\u2014which was missing the little finger.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten anything,\u201d Daemon crooned.</p><p>A shiver went down Saetan\u2019s spine.</p><p>The boyish posturing was gone. Even their relationship as father and son was gone. The man before him was a Warlord Prince of equal rank, who was standing one step away from the killing edge. A Warlord Prince the Blood in Terreille had called the Sadist. A man who was capable of doing anything if provoked the wrong way.</p><p>And that, more than anything else, was reason enough to get Daemon out of Terreille.</p><p>\u201cWould you have told Lucivar he had to have someone guarding his back?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have needed to,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cHe would have known I\u2019d stand with him.\u201d</p><p>This isn\u2019t a fight, Saetan thought.But he caught,too late,the undercurrent that had been hiding beneath the boyish posturing.</p><p>For Daemon, simply being back in Terreille meant being prepared to fight. To kill.</p><p>\u201cPrince, I\u2019m asking you to return to Kaeleer. This is the Keep. It\u2019s a sanctuary. To treat someone as an enemy simply because they\u2019ve come here requesting information would be a violation of everything this place stands for. Daemon, it isn\u2019t done.\u201d At least, not by another guest. What guarded the mountain called Ebon Askavi passed its own judgment on anyone entering the Keep. And people who entered did not always leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize how difficult it is for you to be in this Realm, even here at the Keep,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cIf I had, we would have left hours ago.\u201d</p><p>That keen mind assessed his words while those golden eyes assessed him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll shield?\u201d Daemon finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI will shield.\u201d Despite his efforts to hold on to his own temper, the words came out in a growl.</p><p>Daemon\u2019s lips twitched in a reluctant smile. \u201cYou would have made the same demand of me if I was the one staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I would, but that\u2019s different. I\u2019m your father.\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s smile\u2014and the air around them\u2014warmed. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go back to Kaeleer and see about getting us a meal.\u201d</p><p>Saetan waited, tense, until he no longer felt the presence of the other Black Jewel\u2014confirmation that Daemon had gone through the Gate and returned to Kaeleer. Then he sagged against the doorway until he heard the sound of Craft-enhanced footsteps announcing the Warlord\u2019s return.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right, High Lord?\u201d the Warlord asked. \u201cI felt . . . We all felt . . . Prince Sadi went cold for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. Being in Terreille makes the Prince feel a little defensive.\u201d</p><p>The Warlord stared at him. \u201cIf that\u2019s how Prince Sadi reacts when he\u2019s feeling a little defensive, I wouldn\u2019t want to be around him when he\u2019s feeling really defensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Saetan said quietly, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want to be around him.\u201d</p><p>Theran opened the glass doors that led out to a tiered garden, then closed them again until there was only a finger-width opening. Despite the spring season, it was cold up in the mountains. He would have preferred sitting in a comfortable chair by the fire, except . . .</p><p>This place chilled him a lot more than the cold air. The Black Mountain. Ebon Askavi. Repository of the Blood\u2019s history\u2014and the lair of Witch, the living myth, dreams made flesh. Who was, he suspected, nothing more than a dream and myth. There had been rumors that there was, in fact, a Black-Jeweled Queen who ruled Ebon Askavi, but after the witch storm or war or whatever it was that had swept through Terreille and devastated the Blood, the rumors stopped.</p><p>The place didn\u2019t need a Queen. It was creepy enough without one, and he couldn\u2019t imagine anyone . . . normal . . . ruling this place. There were things flitting in the shadows, watching him. He was sure of it, even if he couldn\u2019t detect a psychic scent or any kind of presence.</p><p>Which didn\u2019t change the conviction that the things he couldn\u2019t feel or see could\u2014and would\u2014kill him before he realized anything was there.</p><p>When the door opened, he breathed a sigh of relief but stayed by the window. If something went wrong, he had a better chance of getting out and catching one of the Winds if he could reach open ground.</p><p>The man who entered the room was Hayllian or Dhemlan\u2014the black hair, brown skin, and gold eyes were common to both long-lived races, and he\u2019d never been able to distinguish between the two. An older man, whose black hair was heavily silvered at the temples, and whose face was beginning to show lines that indicated the weight of centuries. A Red Jewel hung from a gold chain. A Red Jewel flashed in the ring worn on a hand with slender fingers\u2014and long, black-tinted nails.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Theran demanded. The Territory of Hayll had been at the root of all the suffering his people had endured, and he didn\u2019t want to deal with anyone who came from that race. With one exception.</p><p>The man came to an abrupt halt.</p><p>A sharp-edged chill suddenly filled the room, a different kind of cold from the one coming from the open glass door.</p><p>\u201cI am a Warlord Prince who outranks you,\u201d the man said too softly. \u201cNow, puppy, you can brush off your manners and try again\u2014or you can go back to wherever you came from.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d fixed on the man\u2019s race instead of paying attention to the Jewels that did outrank his own and the psychic scent that left no doubt the other man was a Warlord Prince.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, sir,\u201d Theran said, trying to sound sincere. The sun would shine in Hell before he sincerely apologized to a Hayllian\u2014for any reason. \u201cI find this place a bit overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany do. Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t settle your business quickly so that you can be on your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you can help me.\u201d I don\u2019t want you to be the one helping me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the assistant historian/librarian here at the Keep. If I can\u2019t help you, no one can.\u201d</p><p>If I won\u2019t help you, no one will. That was the underlying message.</p><p>Pissy old cock, Theran thought.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t meant to send that thought along a psychic thread, and was almost certain he hadn\u2019t. But judging by the way those gold eyes were starting to glaze, something in his expression must have conveyed the sentiment clearly enough.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with your name,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Because the man was Hayllian,Theran choked on the thought of giving the old bastard his family name.</p><p>\u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou can offer the basic courtesy of your name and where you are from\u2014or you can go to Hell.\u201d</p><p>Theran shivered, because there was something about the soft thunder in that deep voice that warned him his choices were very literal.</p> <p>\u201cTheran. From Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince the mountain didn\u2019t fall down around us and your head didn\u2019t explode, I\u2019m delighted that the consequences of revealing so much information were not, in fact, dire.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t used to being slapped down. Not by a stranger. A response scalded his throat, but he choked it back. He didn\u2019t like the Hayllian on principle\u2014and the Hayllian didn\u2019t seem to like him. But the man was the only way of getting the information he sought.</p><p>\u201cThere has been reason for secrecy,\u201d Theran muttered.</p><p>\u201cThen your lack of manners can be understood\u2014if not forgiven.\u201d</p><p>Cold voice, cold eyes, cold temper. If he\u2019d ruined this chance...</p> <p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re looking for someone,\u201d the man said. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>Maybe there was still a chance.</p><p>\u201cDaemon Sadi,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>The chill in the air gained a sharp edge. The man asked too softly, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>None of your business. Theran bit his tongue to keep from saying the words. \u201cHe owes my family a favor.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure that was an accurate assessment of the message that had been handed down to the males in his family, but it was sufficient explanation for this librarian.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>A long silence while those gold eyes stared at him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have some refreshments brought in for you,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anything.\u201d Hell\u2019s fire! Remember some of the manners you were taught! \u201cThank you. Something hot to drink would be most welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it brought in. And I\u2019ll see what I can find out about Prince Sadi.\u201d</p><p>The Hayllian walked out of the room\u2014and Theran breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The control required to close the door and walk away, leaving that little whelp\u2019s mind intact, made Saetan\u2019s hand tremble.</p><p>I guess Daemon\u2019s not the only one who feels overprotective at times, he thought ruefully.</p><p>Feeling the other presence in the corridor, he made sure the door was firmly shut and stepped away from it as Geoffrey, the Keep\u2019s historian/librarian, dropped the sight shield that had kept him hidden.</p><p>\u201cYou heard?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cSince you left the door open, it was hard not to,\u201d Geoffrey replied.</p><p>\u201cSee to the refreshments, will you? I\u2019ll deal with the rest.\u201d</p><p>Geoffrey raised a white-skinned hand. \u201cJust one question. Who is that jumping jackass?\u201d</p><p>Saetan rocked back on his heels. \u201cJumping jackass? What have you been reading?\u201d</p><p>The other Guardian wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes.</p><p>Saetan had seen over fifty thousand years. Geoffrey had been serving the Keep for much longer. The thought of discovering after all those years that Geoffrey\u2019s choice of recreational reading leaned toward . . . Well, he wasn\u2019t sure what category of fiction would use such a phrase, and he was almost afraid to ask anyone in order to find out. But the whole thing tickled him enough to push aside temper.</p><p>Which, from the look in Geoffrey\u2019s black eyes, might have been the point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look after our guest,\u201d Geoffrey said. \u201cYou look after your son.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Daemon owing anyone inTerreille was enough to prick his temper again, but out of courtesy to Geoffrey, he kept that temper leashed until he opened the Gate between the Realms and walked into the Keep that existed in Kaeleer.</p><p>Daemon studied the food on the table.</p><p>He could breathe again. He hadn\u2019t set foot in the thrice-cursed Realm of Terreille for two years\u2014since he\u2019d gone to Hayll to play out some savage games in order to give Jaenelle the time she\u2019d needed to gather her strength and unleash all her dark power, cleansing the Realms of the Blood tainted by Dorothea and Hekatah SaDiablo.</p><p>Even here at the Keep, which was a protected sanctuary, he had felt the difference between Terreille and Kaeleer, had felt centuries of memories cling to him like cobwebby strands of pain and fear. When he\u2019d lived in Terreille, he\u2019d embraced the pain, and he\u2019d met the fear by playing games that matched\u2014or surpassed\u2014the cruelty and viciousness that Dorothea had excelled in.</p><p>He\u2019d survived seventeen centuries of slavery and cruelty\u2014but not without a price. His body was unmarked; the scars he bore he carried in his mind and heart.</p><p>When he found Saetan in the library, he should have admitted his discomfort instead of trying to push it aside. He should have realized he could no more be in Terreille with his father than he could with his brother, Lucivar. Too many memories\u2014and the last memories of them being in Hayll together still crawled through his dreams on occasion.</p><p>His father in that Hayllian camp, being tortured. His brother in that camp, being tortured. And he, in order to keep them alive and get them out, had been the cruelest torturer.</p><p>Daemon scrubbed his face with his hands and focused on the table. While he waited for Saetan to come back to this Realm, he needed to fix his mind on something else.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we have?\u201d Thick slices of rare roast beef. A vegetable casserole. Crusty bread and whipped butter. And . . .</p><p>He lifted the cover off the last dish, raising an eyebrow at the puff of cold air that was released.</p><p>Two bowls filled with . . .</p><p>Daemon picked one up, gave it a thoughtful study, then picked up a spoon. Since it wasn\u2019t anything he\u2019d seen before, tasting it was the only way to figure out what it was.</p><p>He took a spoonful, then closed his eyes as the flavors melted on his tongue.</p><p>A sweetened cheese whipped into lightness. Little chunks of chocolate. Veins of raspberry sauce.</p><p>He opened his eyes and licked his lips. Then he studied the table once more. There were two bowls of the stuff, so one of them must be for him. What difference did it make if he ate it before the rest of the meal or after?</p><p>Pleased with the rationalization\u2014in case one was needed\u2014he dug in.</p><p>Whom was he going to have to bribe to get the recipe? And if he did get it, would he keep it to make himself, or would he offer to share it with Mrs. Beale, the large, rather terrifying witch who was his cook at SaDiablo Hall? Sharing a recipe like this might be a fair trade for her tolerating his putting in a small, additional kitchen for his personal use. So far the only reasons Mrs. Beale hadn\u2019t declared outright war on this affront to her domestic territory were (1) he owned the Hall; (2) his Black Jewels outranked her Yellow Jewels by a considerable degree; and (3) technically, she worked for him.</p><p>None of which meant a damn thing to Mrs. Beale unless it was convenient for her to remember them.</p><p>And in a way, having Mrs. Beale challenge his authority and power was convenient for him too. Now that he was ruling the Territory of Dhemlan, he understood why Saetan had been so passive within his own home and allowed himself to be dominated at times by the people who worked for him.</p><p>The people in Dhemlan\u2014or more accurately the Queens and their courts, who were the ones who had to answer to him directly\u2014feared him. They had reason to fear him. The Black Jewels were a reservoir for the power that lived within him, a warning of the depth and potency of strength that could be turned against anyone he considered an enemy. But at home . . .</p><p>He\u2019d been in places where everyone lived in constant, debilitating fear. He didn\u2019t want to live in a place like that. He didn\u2019t want to be the cause of that. Not in his home. Not with the people who worked for him.</p><p>And especially not with Jaenelle, the woman who was his life.</p><p>So he appreciated the game he played with Mrs. Beale, although, admittedly, she was a damn scary woman and his fear of her was not altogether feigned.</p><p>Rather like his father, come to think of it.</p><p>Lucivar was right. There was something cleansing\u2014not to mention fun\u2014about being able to throw yourself against a strong personality just to see what would happen, and to know you would come to no harm by doing it. It was a relief to be a son, to really be a son of a father who drew a firm line about some things and wouldn\u2019t bend but who also had a fine understanding of when to be indulgent\u2014or look the other way altogether.</p><p>A father who truly understood him.</p><p>He was just scraping the last of the treat out of the second bowl when that father thundered into the room.</p><p>Mother Night, Daemon thought, hastily vanishing both bowls.</p><p>\u201cIf you truly owe a favor to that little prick\u2019s family, then we will pay the debt and be rid of him,\u201d Saetan snarled. \u201cOr I can send him to the bowels of Hell here and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ill-mannered Warlord Prince who came to the Keep looking for someone? He\u2019s looking for you. He says you owe his family a favor.\u201d</p><p>Ice shivered in his veins, a prelude to his unsheathing the lethal blade of his temper. \u201cWho?\u201d he asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cTheran. From Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Dena Nehele. A place he wouldn\u2019t forget.</p><p>Daemon tightened the leash on his temper. \u201cWhat does he look like?\u201d</p><p>A light brush against the first of his inner barriers. When he opened that first level of his mind to his father, he saw the man. The same green eyes. The same sun-kissed skin. The same dark hair.</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d Daemon whispered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saetan shook his head. \u201cHe said his name was Theran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man I knew. Jared. This one has the look of him.\u201d</p><p>He could feel Saetan reevaluating, making an effort to rein in his own formidable temper. \u201cDo you owe them a favor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Jared had left a written account of his journey with Lia while being pursued by Dorothea\u2019s Master of the Guard. Within that account, which Jared had left at the Keep for Daemon, Jaenelle had found the answer to cleansing the taint from the Blood without destroying all of the Blood.</p><p>So, in a way, he did owe Jared. Whether he owed anything to Jared\u2019s bloodline . . .</p><p>\u201cI liked Jared,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cHe was a good man. So for his sake, I would be willing to talk to this Prince Theran and find out what he wants.\u201d He paused and considered. \u201cBut not here. I\u2019d like Jaenelle to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I would trust her instincts about him better than I\u2019d trust mine.\u201d</p><p>Saetan considered that and nodded. \u201cThen we\u2019ll arrange to have him brought to the Hall. How soon do you want me to discover your whereabouts?\u201d</p><p>Daemon huffed out a laugh. \u201cSince you\u2019re my father, you\u2019d know where to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m your father. As far as Prince Theran is concerned, I\u2019m just the assistant historian/librarian. Just a \u2018pissy old cock.\u2019 \u201d Saetan\u2019s smile turned feral and sharp. \u201cThe boy doesn\u2019t shield his thoughts as well as he should.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit. \u201cArrange to have him arrive at the Hall late this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d As if trying to shake off the mood\u2014and the temper\u2014Saetan looked at the table and raised an eyebrow. \u201cI see you enjoyed the sweet-cheese confection.\u201d</p> <p>Damn. He must not have vanished the bowls fast enough.</p><p>\u201cEven so,\u201d Saetan continued, \u201cyou should eat some of the beef and vegetables.\u201d</p><p>An undercurrent of amusement. A fatherly kind of amusement.</p><p>Feeling like a boy wasn\u2019t as much fun when he didn\u2019t choose to feel like a boy. And feeling like an erring son was downright uncomfortable. \u201cI just meant to taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Saetan pulled out a chair and sat down. He took a spoonful of vegetable casserole and a slice of roast beef, and warmed his customary goblet of yarbarah, the blood wine that was all the sustenance the demon-dead\u2014and Guardians\u2014needed.</p><p>Not seeing any options, Daemon sat across from his father and filled his own plate.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been very little of interest in those piles of papers,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cEven with the preservation spells that were put on them, most are illegible or the parchment crumbles when it\u2019s touched. But I did find a few things\u2014like the recipe for that sweet-cheese confection. Well, the basic idea for it at any rate. I had to fiddle with it a bit and embellished it after that.\u201d</p><p>Daemon chewed a mouthful of beef and swallowed carefully. \u201cYou made that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Like you, I enjoy puttering in the kitchen on occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the only one who has the recipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>Finally Daemon asked,\u201cWhat are the chances of you sharing that recipe?\u201d</p><p>His father, the too-knowing bastard, just smiled.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>Aroom within the Keep held one of the thirteen Gates that connected the three Realms of Terreille, Kaeleer, and Hell. On the Dark Altar stood a four-branched candelabra. When the black candles were lit and the spell was invoked, a stone wall turned to mist and became a Gate between the Realms.</p><p>Following the assistant historian/librarian, Theran stepped out of that mist into a room that looked almost the same as the one he\u2019d just left, but it felt different. It felt darker.</p><p>He had reached Kaeleer, the Shadow Realm. He was really here.</p><p>And home had never felt so far away.</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Stepping out of the Coach that had brought him from the Keep to this place,Theran stared at the massive structure of dark gray stone that rose up in front of him. It sprawled over the land, and its towers speared the sky. Its size intimidated, and the feel of age and dark power that surrounded it was sufficient warning to any visitor that a smart man walked softly around anything that lived behind those walls.</p><p>\u201cIs that an enclosed community?\u201d he asked. He could understand the feeling of that much power if several hundred Blood had lived in a place for many generations. There had been a few places \u201cruled\u201d by covens in the Shalador reserves that had a similar feel. Or so he\u2019d been told. Most of those places\u2014and the strong witches who had lived in them\u2014hadn\u2019t survived the purges that had been ordered a few years ago by Dorothea\u2019s pet Queens.</p><p>\u201cLike a village, you mean?\u201d the Coach driver said. Then he made a sound that might have been an effort not to laugh. \u201cNo. The village is that way.\u201d He pointed in the opposite direction. \u201cThis here is a private drive until you reach the bridge. After that, it becomes a public road to Halaway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate . . .\u201d He was looking at a residence? That feeling of dark power came from one family?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s SaDiablo Hall,\u201d the driver said. \u201cFamily seat of the SaDiablo family and home of the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan. I was told to bring you here.\u201d</p><p>SaDiablo. SaDiablo. Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.</p><p>But Dorothea SaDiablo was dead, wasn\u2019t she? Completely destroyed, body, mind, and Jewels. Wasn\u2019t she?</p><p>\u201cDaemon Sadi lives here?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>Was Sadi still controlled by the SaDiablo family? Was he still a slave? Was this branch of the SaDiablo family any better than the ones who had tried to destroy Terreille?</p><p>Have I just handed myself to the enemy? Damn that Hayllian bastard for sending me here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the Coach around to the stables, then wait around a bit to see if I\u2019m needed,\u201d the driver said. \u201cYou should go on up to the Hall and state your business. Won\u2019t attract any atten\u2014\u201d</p><p>A solitary howl rose from the trees off to the right. Then another howl rose up from the left. The third came from behind him.</p><p>Theran turned in a circle, his heart hammering against his chest. Nothing he could see, but something was out there. He was picking up psychic scents, a feeling of power moving toward him from several directions. But those scents were just enough off-kilter that he couldn\u2019t identify what was out there.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the driver said, scratching his head. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve got their attention, you\u2019ve got everyone\u2019s attention. So you might as well go on up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Theran asked. \u201cGuard dogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves. The pack lives in the north woods that are part of this estate. They\u2019re protected by the Hall\u2014and they protect the Hall.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. \u201cCould be worse,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cCould be,\u201d the driver agreed. He paused and gave Theran a considering look. \u201cDon\u2019t know if any are here right now, but you don\u2019t want to be upsetting the cats. They\u2019re big, and they\u2019re mean.\u201d</p><p>Theran forced a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they would eat me.\u201d</p><p>The driver just looked at him.</p><p>\u201cMother Night.\u201d Could it be any worse? He didn\u2019t ask because he didn\u2019t want the driver to tell him about whatever was worse than man-eating cats someone kept as pets.</p><p>The driver touched two fingers to his temple as a salute and went back into the Coach.</p><p>Theran quickly stepped off the landing web and hurried to the front door, which opened before he could knock, and showed him what could be worse than man-eating cats\u2014a large, stern-faced man who was wearing a butler\u2019s uniform and was also a Red-Jeweled Warlord.</p><p>Outranked by a servant, Theran thought as he obeyed the silent invitation to step inside.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d the butler said. \u201cHow may I be of service?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Daemon Sadi. I was told I could find him here.\u201d Of course, the Hayllian prick at the Keep hadn\u2019t mentioned he\u2019d be looking for Sadi inside a SaDiablo fortress.</p><p>As the butler turned one hand, he suddenly held a small silver tray. The use of Craft was so smooth, Theran stared at the tray for a moment, feeling envious of the subtle training the butler must have received. Oh, Talon had given him the best training available, but their rough-and-ready life didn\u2019t require subtlety in anything except fighting.</p><p>\u201cYour card?\u201d the butler said.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. Did people still use such fussy things? Would the court he hoped to create have to use them?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a card,\u201d Theran said, feeling like an awkward child who\u2019d been caught out pretending to be an adult.</p><p>The butler\u2019s hand turned. The tray vanished. \u201cYour name?\u201d</p><p>Theran hesitated. His family had survived by hiding. But would anyone here in Kaeleer understand the significance of the name?</p><p>\u201cTheran Grayhaven,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cTerritory?\u201d the butler prodded after a moment\u2019s silence.</p><p>\u201cDena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>The butler tipped his head in a tiny bow of acknowledgment. \u201cI will inquire if the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan is available to receive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to talk to . . .\u201d He was talking to the butler\u2019s back, so there was no point continuing. Besides, the man didn\u2019t go far\u2014just to the back of the great hall.</p><p>After a quick knock on the door, the butler stepped into an adjoining room and stepped back out a few moments later.</p><p>Nothing subtle about the snub if the butler now informed him that the Prince wasn\u2019t available.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d the butler said.</p><p>Theran followed the man back to the half-open door. The butler stepped in and announced, \u201cPrince Theran Grayhaven of the Territory of Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Beale,\u201d a deep, cultured voice replied. \u201cShow him in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beale stepped aside, allowing Theran to enter, then retreated, closing the door behind him.</p><p>The room was shaped like a reversed L. The long side was an informal sitting room, complete with tables, chairs, bookcases, and a leather sofa large enough for a full-grown man to sleep on. The short side of the room had floor-to-ceiling bookcases filling the back wall, red velvet covering the side walls, and a large blackwood desk with two chairs in front of it for visitors.</p><p>From behind the desk rose the most beautiful man Theran had ever seen. Hayllian coloring\u2014the thick black hair, golden eyes, and light brown skin. But the man moved like something too graceful to be completely human, and as he came around the desk,Theran felt the punch of sexual heat.</p> <p>\u201cPrince Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>The voice caressed him, a warm syrup over his skin, producing an unwelcome arousal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Daemon Sadi.\u201d</p><p>Of course this was Sadi. Who else could it be?</p><p>He\u2019d heard stories. Who hadn\u2019t heard stories? But now he had a glimpse of why Sadi had been called the Sadist. All Warlord Princes had that sexual heat to some degree, but he\u2019d never met another Warlord Prince who could halfway seduce a normally uninterested man just by speaking, just by walking toward that person.</p> <p>Then the door opened, Sadi looked around, and Theran felt the ground crumbling right out from under him.</p><p>He\u2019d thought the sexual heat had been a deliberate ploy to throw him off-balance. It wasn\u2019t. The punch he\u2019d experienced when he\u2019d walked into the room was Sadi with his sexuality chained. One look at the woman who walked into the room, and Sadi . . .</p><p>Theran froze. Warlord Princes were territorial at the best of times, and lethally so when it came to a lover. A woman could end a relationship with a Warlord Prince without fear, but the only kind of male who could survive an attempt at poaching was a stronger Warlord Prince.</p><p>Based on what he was picking up from Sadi\u2019s psychic scent, this woman was definitely the lover, and since he was a stranger, just being in the same room with her might be enough to provoke Sadi into a kill.</p><p>Not pretty,Theran decided. Attractive in an uncommon way, but definitely not what he would call pretty. The golden hair looked shaggy and was too short for him to find personally appealing. And she looked too thin to have the kind of curves a man would find interesting.</p><p>And all those things that would have made Theran dismiss her as a potential partner didn\u2019t seem to matter to Sadi at all. The hunger in those gold eyes when he looked at her, the hunger that had sharpened his psychic scent . . .</p> <p>She stopped, narrowed her blue eyes, and rocked back on her heels.</p><p>\u201cNighthawk and I are going for a ride,\u201d she said. \u201cBeale said you wanted to see me before I went out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear a hat,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>Her mouth primmed. \u201cI don\u2019t like hats.\u201d</p><p>Daemon moved toward her.</p><p>Theran adjusted his coat to hide his reaction to the heat pouring off the other man.</p><p>The woman just narrowed her eyes a little more and seemed immune to the feel of seduction blanketing the room.</p><p>Daemon cupped her face in his hands. \u201cYou need to wear a hat when you go out in the sun,\u201d he purred.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t wear a hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy nose doesn\u2019t turn bright pink and peel.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at Daemon.</p><p>\u201cAnd since I adore that nose,\u201d Daemon said, kissing the tip of the adored nose, \u201cand the rest of your face, and the rest of you . . .\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s hands caressed her lightly but thoroughly as they traveled along her shoulders and down her back, his arms wrapping her tight against him as his mouth covered hers in a kiss that . . .</p><p>Theran felt his legs go weak. He should avert his eyes, give Sadi and the woman some token of privacy. But he couldn\u2019t look away.</p><p>He wanted that kind of heat and hunger. Hoped he\u2019d find it with the new Queen who would rule Dena Nehele.</p><p>And hoped he could get out of this room very, very soon.</p><p>How in the name of Hell did anyone else manage to live here?</p><p>Sadi finally ended the kiss and loosened his hold. His lover braced her hands against his chest as if to push away but didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d she muttered. On her second try, she managed to push away from Sadi and stand on her own. Then she studied the warm golden eyes that were watching her. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll wear the damn hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Daemon purred.</p><p>\u201cPleased with yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>A flashing grin was her answer.</p><p>As she headed for the door, Daemon caught her and turned her around.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone I want you to meet,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>Theran felt those blue eyes lock on to his face, and would have sworn they changed to a darker blue, a sapphire blue that became a doorway to something dangerous, something feral. Something he couldn\u2019t name but knew he didn\u2019t want to see.</p><p>\u201cThis is the Warlord Prince Theran Grayhaven, from Dena Nehele,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said, but I believe he can trace his bloodline back to Jared, a Warlord I knew a few centuries ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared,\u201d she said in a voice that made Theran shiver. \u201cAnd Lia?\u201d</p><p>Afraid to answer\u2014and more afraid not to\u2014Theran nodded.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t look away from those sapphire eyes.</p><p>Then her eyes were simply blue again. \u201cWelcome to the Hall, Prince Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>Maybe it was because he was getting used to the feel of being in a room with Sadi that he was finally getting some sense of the woman.</p><p>A Queen. He felt certain she was a Queen. That caste had a distinctive psychic scent. But he couldn\u2019t figure out if she wore a lighter Jewel or a dark one. She seemed to circle around his own Green, feeling lighter one moment and darker the next.</p><p>Your wits must still be addled, he thought. The Blood had a Birthright Jewel and a Jewel of rank, and each had a clear, separate feel. Since surviving could sometimes depend on knowing if the person you were facing wore a darker Jewel than your own, conflicting information like he was picking up from the woman could prove deadly.</p><p>\u201cPrince Grayhaven,\u201d Daemon said,\u201cthis is my wife, the Lady Jaenelle Angelline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a pleasure, Lady.\u201d</p><p>A horse bugled, a sound full of annoyance, followed a moment later by hooves thundering down on a hard surface.</p><p>Jaenelle hitched a thumb over her shoulder. \u201cMy ride is getting impatient.\u201d</p><p>Theran wondered why anyone would bring a horse into the great hall\u2014and wondered why the animal had sounded so loud\u2014but he didn\u2019t get a chance to ask.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Grateful to be alone,Theran scrubbed his hands over his face. After the past few minutes, he needed a long walk or a cold shower\u2014or both.</p><p>As Daemon escorted Jaenelle into the great hall, he lightly touched the stallion\u2019s mind. *I need to talk to the Lady before you go riding.*</p><p>The stallion, wearing a hackamore and barely enough leather to be called a saddle, tossed his head, revealing the Gray Jewel that was usually hidden under his forelock.</p><p>Nighthawk was kindred\u2014the name given to the Blood who were not human. A different body and a different race, but a Warlord Prince was still a Warlord Prince, and those who had chosen Jaenelle as their Queen had learned to work together and share their Lady. In most ways.</p><p>*Theran Grayhaven,* Daemon said on a psychic thread aimed exclusively at Jaenelle. *What do you think of him?*</p><p>*Why does it matter?*</p><p>*He\u2019s come here to ask a favor. I can hear him out or show him the door.*</p><p>When she looked at him, he saw who she was beneath the surface: Witch. The living myth. Dreams made flesh. The Queen, even though she no longer ruled.</p><p>*I spun a tangled web this afternoon,* she said. *That\u2019s why I want to go riding\u2014to let my mind rest while I focus on something physical.* She paused. *He\u2019s part of it, Daemon. So is his connection to Jared and Lia. Hopefully a good gallop will clear my head and help me understand the vision.*</p><p>*Then I\u2019ll hear him out and arrange to have him stay with us for the night.*</p><p>Jaenelle nodded.</p><p>*So,* Daemon said. *You\u2019re riding Nighthawk this afternoon. Are you riding me tonight?*</p><p>\u201cDaemon!\u201d</p><p>The combination of shock and laughter in her voice told Beale, the footman Holt, and even the horse what they\u2019d been talking about. The color blazing in her cheeks when she realized she\u2019d said his name out loud in that tone of voice confirmed whatever assumptions the other males had.</p><p>\u201cI was just asking,\u201d Daemon said, trying to sound meek instead of amused\u2014or aroused.</p><p>He glanced at Beale, whose mouth had curved in a tiny smile despite the otherwise stern expression.</p><p>Mother Night, he was going to have to tell the butler not to arrange for an intimate dinner. Under the intimidating exterior, Beale was a romantic and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to exile Theran to a guest room and a dinner provided on a tray so that Lady Angelline could have a private dinner with her lover, who was also her adoring husband. And since he liked the idea of a private dinner much better than entertaining a man who had angered his father, he had to nip that idea before it took root. At least for tonight.</p><p>And apparently his thoughts had been a little too apparent, because Jaenelle was staring at him. Fortunately, she was still focused on his face.</p><p>As she turned away, she pointed at Beale. \u201cOur guest will be joining us for dinner. I will expect him at the table.\u201d</p><p>Beale flicked a look at Daemon, who shrugged. \u201cVery well, Lady.\u201d</p><p>She strode past Nighthawk and right out the door.</p><p>\u201cPrince Nighthawk,\u201d Holt called softly.</p><p>Using Craft, the footman sailed a hat across the great hall. Nighthawk caught the brim of the hat with his teeth, bobbed his head, then turned and walked out the front door, which closed behind him.</p><p>Daemon stared at the door. Mother Night, Jaenelle was going to be so pissed when Nighthawk planted his feet and refused to move until she put on the hat.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich one of you told the horse about the hat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When neither Beale nor Holt answered him, he nodded. \u201cThree out of three of us, then.\u201d</p><p>The Blood survived within a complex dance of power. There was caste, social rank, and Jewel rank, and an ever-changing pattern of who was dominant. Didn\u2019t matter which measuring stick was used, he was the dominant male here at the Hall. In the whole damn Realm, for that matter. But there were times, like this, when it tickled him to know that all the males who lived at the Hall were equal in one way: they all served, and they were very good at assessing one another\u2019s skills and letting the one most likely to succeed take the lead.</p><p>Of course, Jaenelle didn\u2019t always appreciate the fact that they worked together so well. Which also tickled him.</p> <p>Until he remembered what waited for him in the study.</p><p>Daemon tipped his head toward the study door. \u201cA pot of coffee and whatever Mrs. Beale might have handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then you\u2019ll be unavailable?\u201d Beale asked.</p><p>Daemon considered Theran\u2019s claim that he owed the Grayhaven family a favor, and he considered Jaenelle\u2019s certainty that Theran was connected to the vision she had seen.</p><p>Jaenelle had been trained by the Arachnians, the golden spiders who were the weavers of dreams, to spin the tangled webs of dreams and visions. Even now, with her power diminished from what it had been, she was the most accomplished\u2014and deadly\u2014Black Widow in Kaeleer.</p> <p>So he would listen to Theran\u2019s claim, and no matter what he heard, the other Warlord Prince would join him and his Lady for dinner.</p><p>Whether Theran Grayhaven would see another sunrise was a different consideration.</p><p>He looked at Beale and knew the butler understood the nature of the man who owned the Hall.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Daemon said softly. \u201cI\u2019ll be unavailable.\u201d</p><p>Something had changed, Theran thought as he watched Daemon walk back into the study and settle behind the blackwood desk. The sexuality was chained again, thank the Darkness, but the mood was both lighter and more grim than when Theran had first entered the room.</p><p>Sadi leaned back in his chair, steepled his slender fingers, and rested the black-tinted forefinger nails against his chin.</p> <p>\u201cI understand you think I owe you a favor,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire.</p><p>\u201cYou are Jared\u2019s descendant, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Theran replied. \u201cThe last of the bloodline that goes back to Jared and Lia, who was the last Gray-Jeweled Queen we had in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of that bloodline, I\u2019m willing to hear you out.\u201d</p><p>The words were courteously spoken, but there was a growing chill in the deep voice.</p><p>How to explain when it mattered so much, when so much was at stake?</p><p>He shrugged out of his coat and vanished it to give himself a little more time. He\u2019d thought of little else during the journey between the Keep and here\u2014what to say, how to explain. Now . . .</p> <p>\u201cWe need a Queen.\u201d</p><p>Daemon raised one eyebrow. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>Theran leaned forward, gripping the arms of the chair hard enough to make his hands ache. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s been like for my people. Two generations after Lia\u2014just two!\u2014the bloodline failed. The last Grayhaven Queen wore a Yellow Jewel. She wouldn\u2019t have been the Territory Queen at all if she hadn\u2019t been a Grayhaven. After that . . .\u201d He swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cAfter that,\u201d Daemon said, \u201cthe Queens who were willing to sell themselves to Hayll in order to rise to a power they wouldn\u2019t have gained otherwise were the ones who ruled. Those who opposed Dorothea\u2019s bid to control the whole of Terreille were either broken so they had little or no power, or were killed outright so the males would have no one to serve except Dorothea\u2019s pets.\u201d</p><p>Theran stared at Daemon. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a pleasure slave for a lot of centuries, controlled by Dorothea and the Ladies she sold me to. I watched some Territories fall, village by village, court by court, until there was nothing left that was decent, no one left who was honorable.\u201d Daemon smiled bitterly. \u201cOh, I slaughtered the bitch\u2019s pets. Buried more of them than anyone will ever know. Hell\u2019s fire, there were times when Lucivar and I destroyed entire courts. But Dorothea was like a vile weed with a deep taproot. No matter how much you cut away, her poisonous influence would grow back. It always grew back\u2014until the taint of her and the bitch who backed her was cleansed from the Blood for good.\u201d</p><p>Theran licked his lips. \u201cThe storm of power two years ago. You know about that?\u201d</p><p>Something queer flickered in Daemon\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI know about that. I know what it did\u2014and I know what it cost.\u201d</p><p>You know what it cost you, Theran thought, feeling hopeful that Daemon might be more sympathetic than he seemed. \u201cWe lost half the Blood in Dena Nehele to that storm. We lost half of the survivors while quelling the landen uprisings that followed that storm. There are one hundred Warlord Princes left in the whole of Dena Nehele. One hundred. My Green Jewel is the darkest we have.\u201d Not quite, but he didn\u2019t want to mention Talon.</p><p>\u201cTheran . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any Queens.\u201d Theran rammed his fingers through his hair, then ended up fisting them and pulling until his scalp stung.</p><p>\u201cTheran.\u201d</p><p>He let go of his hair and gripped the chair\u2019s arms again. \u201cAll right, we do have some Queens. But they\u2019re old women. Or they\u2019re little girls who are too young to deal with grown men, especially men as volatile as Warlord Princes. And there are a handful of adolescent Queens, but they\u2019re already starting to act like the Queens we\u2019re finally free of, and there\u2019s been some muttering that the Warlord Princes would rather kill them than let a bitch become old enough to rule. If those girls act like the previous Queens and we accept them, we\u2019ve won nothing. All the blood that was shed and the people who were lost would have been for nothing.\u201d</p><p>When Daemon didn\u2019t respond, Theran plunged on with the shining coin of hope that Talon had given him. \u201cWhen Jared was an old man, dying from the wounds of his last fight, he told a trusted friend this one thing. He said, \u2018If the need is great and nothing the family can do on its own will help Dena Nehele survive, find Daemon Sadi. Ask him for help. But only once.\u2019 \u201d Theran closed his eyes for a moment. \u201cThose were the last words Jared spoke. Well, we did all we could. We fought and we bled and we watched our people drown in the filth of Hayll. And now I\u2019m the last one left. The last one. So I\u2019m here, asking for help.\u201d</p><p>A long silence, interrupted by a knock on the door. All the items on the desk vanished, replaced by a woven mat as Beale brought in a large tray and set it in the center of the desk.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Beale,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>After Beale left the room, Daemon poured coffee for both of them, then leaned back in his chair, ignoring the thin sandwiches and nutcakes that were also on the tray.</p><p>\u201cYou say you need a Queen,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cWhat, exactly, are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>Theran took a sip of coffee to wet his suddenly dry throat, then took a deep breath\u2014and told him.</p><p>Dinner was over; the strained effort to be a courteous and entertaining host was finished\u2014at least for tonight.</p><p>Daemon stood in front of the dresser in the Consort\u2019s suite and stared into the mirror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had worse days, old son,\u201d he told his reflection. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve had worse days.\u201d</p><p>But being pummeled by Theran\u2019s words had made him feel soiled and weary, and listening to that particular blend of hope and despair had stirred up memories until they swelled and burst in his mind like pus coming out of a wound gone septic.</p><p>He\u2019d heard it before. Heard it for centuries. He\u2019d watched young men grow old and break under that blend of hope and despair.</p><p>It didn\u2019t help that Theran looked so much like Jared, as if all the generations in between had been erased. But Theran wasn\u2019t Jared, and there was some internal difference that Daemon recognized but couldn\u2019t name\u2014and that difference was the reason he had considered Jared a friend and would never consider Theran as more than an acquaintance. Nothing indicated he wasn\u2019t a good man committed to helping his people, but . . .</p><p>A knock on the door that connected his bedroom with Jaenelle\u2019s. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, turning away from the mirror.</p><p>She came in, wearing a silky sapphire robe.</p><p>His stomach clenched. He\u2019d been the one who had hinted this afternoon\u2014shit, more than hinted\u2014that he was interested in sex tonight. But that was before he\u2019d talked to Theran, before the barbs of memories had hooked into his mind and heart. Now he hoped she was too tired to want more than a cuddle.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to talk about it before dinner,\u201d Jaenelle said, \u201cbut I need to know what sort of favor Theran wants.\u201d She stretched out on the bed, propped her head in one hand, and studied him. \u201cDaemon, do you feel all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He wasn\u2019t fine, he was nowhere close to fine, and he needed to tell her that instead of trying to hide it.</p><p>Talk. She wanted to talk. That, at least, he could do.</p><p>He removed his wallet from the inside pocket of his black jacket and dropped it on the dresser before he shrugged out of the jacket and hung it on the clothes stand so that his valet could decide if it needed to be cleaned, pressed, or simply aired. He\u2019d done without a personal valet for a lot of years, and there were times when he missed the independence of having his wardrobe be his. On the other hand, Jazen managed to keep his favorite shirts hidden, leaving others out as bait when Jaenelle went foraging in his closet. For that reason alone he was willing to follow his valet\u2019s rules about where to leave the clothing that had been worn.</p><p>\u201cTheran wants my help to convince a Queen from Kaeleer to go to Terreille and rule Dena Nehele,\u201d Daemon said, returning to the dresser. He positioned himself in the mirror so that he could see Jaenelle\u2019s face, but his own reflection hid the rest of her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d sat on the bed dozens of times, talking to him while he got undressed, before they both retired to her bedroom. Their bedroom, since he used this room only when she wasn\u2019t home. But tonight it bothered him, scratched on his skin. Scratch, scratch, scratch. Scraping at those pus-filled wounds.</p><p>\u201cSay that again,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201cDena Nehele needs a Queen who knows what it means to be a Queen, who knows Protocol and remembers the Blood\u2019s code of honor. Who knows how to live by the Old Ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t find a Queen like that?\u201d</p> <p>Daemon sighed. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, I think what\u2019s left of two races\u2014Dena Nehele and Shalador\u2014will wither and die.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hands in his trouser pockets, then called in some coins to provide an excuse for why he was still standing at the dresser, emptying his pockets, and delaying the moment when he had to tell her he was too churned up to be of use to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell him?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cI told him I\u2019d think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d When Jared had answered his summons that last time, Daemon had known Dena Nehele would fall under Dorothea\u2019s relentless campaign to rule all of Terreille. Had he done the Shalador Warlord any favor by encouraging Jared to hold on to love for as long as possible? \u201cThe males in Kaeleer won\u2019t tolerate one of their Queens going to Terreille.\u201d</p><p>A hesitation. \u201cI know a Queen who might be willing,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cShe knows Protocol, although she prefers to ignore it as much as the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Daemon snorted softly as he fiddled with the coins, stacking and restacking them. The Territory Queens in Kaeleer belonged to Jaenelle\u2019s coven. They had been her First Circle and they were still her closest friends. Thanks to Saetan, every one of them knew all the nuances of Protocol and the give-and-take of power between males and females. Thanks to their own perversity, the Ladies ignored the formality of Protocol every chance they could. And it was that blend that made them so formidable\u2014and made them such good Queens.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a distant cousin of Aaron\u2019s,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cShe\u2019s a few years older than me. She\u2019s not a close friend, but I like her. As part of her own apprenticeship, she lived at the Hall with the rest of us for four months to get \u2018court polish.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Since Jaenelle\u2019s court had been the most informal gathering of power he\u2019d ever seen, the humor of sending anyone there for training eased the tightness in his stomach a little. \u201cDid she acquire any polish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe got lessons in Protocol from Papa,\u201d Jaenelle replied. \u201cThose will polish anybody.\u201d</p> <p>It was easier to talk to her reflection, so he kept his back to the room while he continued to fiddle with the items on the dresser. \u201cWhat will her court say about relocating to Terreille?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle hesitated. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a court at the moment. That\u2019s why I think she would be willing to do this.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her exotically beautiful face, which only hinted at the wonderful and terrifying Self that lived beneath the human skin. She was capable of cruelty, but the cruelty was always entwined with justice.</p><p>What had she seen in her tangled web?</p><p>And why was the arm that had been covered by sapphire silk now bare?</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her court?\u201d His stomach tightened again as the edge of his temper sharpened.</p><p>\u201cInstead of renewing their contracts, her entire First Circle resigned, and that broke the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked too softly. There were very few reasons why all the males would walk away from a Queen, and none of those reasons would help Theran or Dena Nehele.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t like the answer.\u201d</p><p>He already didn\u2019t like any of this. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle sighed. \u201cShe wears a Rose Jewel, which makes her a minor Queen in a Territory like Dharo; she doesn\u2019t come from an aristo family; and\u201d\u2014she winced\u2014\u201cshe\u2019s not pretty.\u201d</p><p>Fury rose in him, a molten ice. \u201cThat\u2019s it? That\u2019s all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t offer flash and glitter. It\u2019s not in her. But she\u2019s a good, solid Queen, and she\u2019s got the tenacity to dig in and work.\u201d</p><p>Daemon blew out a breath and rolled his shoulders to try to shake off some of the tension. Tried to shake off that terrible blend of hope and despair that was making it so hard to think clearly. But he\u2019d done what he could, hadn\u2019t he? Even now he was doing what he could. \u201cWell, Jared will have to give up some of what he wants in order to get the rest, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJared?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>Her voice sounded oddly sharp, and that pricked his temper, honed it to a lethal edge. But he was so tired tonight. So desperately tired. Still had to play the game, though. Dorothea couldn\u2019t prove he\u2019d helped the Shalador Warlord, but lately the women she\u2019d chosen to use him as a pleasure slave were an added barb of cruelty.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we talking about Jared?\u201d</p><p>He turned toward the bed. \u201cBecause\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slammed back against the dresser hard enough to make everything rattle. His heart hammered against his chest, and his body was suddenly\u2014and painfully\u2014aroused.</p><p>There was a filthy bitch sprawled on his bed.</p><p>She lay on her side, her head propped up on one hand, one leg forward and bent at the knee to help her balance. Nothing blatantly provocative about the position, which meant only that she was smarter than the bitches who had tried before her. She was wearing sheer white stockings that came up to midthigh. No need for a garter belt when Craft could hold the stockings in place. Above that, she was wearing a simple white shift that ended just above the stockings and was sheer enough that it didn\u2019t hide the body beneath.</p><p>It also didn\u2019t hide the fact that she wasn\u2019t wearing anything else.</p><p>His cock strained against his trousers, wanting to be sheathed inside her and flood her with come.</p><p>Bitch. Filthy bitch.</p><p>\u201cDaemon?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d succeeded. Where all the others had failed, this one had succeeded. She made him want, made him need. And when the little bitch informed Dorothea that he could be aroused, the slavery he now endured would be nothing compared with what would be done to him to breed him with Dorothea\u2019s select bitches.</p><p>\u201cDaemon? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>And the one untouched thing he had left to offer, the one clean thing he had given to no one else, would be taken from him. Like everything else had been taken from him.</p><p>Because of the little bitch now stinking up his bed.</p><p>She sat up. Shifted closer to the edge of the bed. His bed. \u201cI think I should leave.\u201d</p><p>Leave? No, no, no. Not until he\u2019d purged himself of some of this anger, some of this hatred, some of this need.</p><p>He raised his right hand. The Black Jewel in his ring flashed. And he saw her tense as Black locks and shields surrounded the room, trapping her inside. With him.</p><p>This was his room, the one bit of peace and privacy he could claim. That was his bed, a place he shared with no one. And her body was his to do with as he pleased.</p><p>He took a step toward the bed, delighted by the way she shivered. Not with anticipation. The little bitch had finally figured out what she found in his bed wasn\u2019t going to be pleasure.</p><p>He took another step.</p><p>She tried to bolt, tried to launch herself off the bed.</p><p>Snarling viciously, he caught her, threw her back down on the bed, and came down on top of her, forcing her legs apart, pushing against her, taking dark pleasure in the knowledge that the moment he vanished his clothes, his cock would ram into her.</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d</p><p>Go ahead, he thought. Plead now that you can\u2019t control what\u2019s coming. Could never control what\u2019s coming.</p><p>His hands tightened on her wrists. Tightened and tightened until just a little more pressure would break bone. Her pulse hammered under his fingers. Her heart thundered against his chest.</p><p>He smelled her fear. Reveled in the scent of it.</p><p>She turned her head, as if daring to deny him her mouth.</p><p>He clamped his teeth on the spot where her neck and right shoulder connected....</p><p>And breathed in a scent that soothed and excited him. He licked that spot and tasted a flavor more heady than the best wine. And knew whose body trembled beneath his.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle,\u201d he whispered, nuzzling that spot, breathing in those scents that could belong to no other woman. \u201cJaenelle.\u201d</p><p>His hands relaxed, still cuffing her wrists but gently now. So gently.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle.\u201d He was safe. He was safe. She wouldn\u2019t hurt him for wanting her. She wouldn\u2019t punish him for needing her.</p><p>He could give her this because she was the one he had waited for.</p><p>As he raised his head to look at her beloved face, he realized something wasn\u2019t right about the room.</p><p>It didn\u2019t smell like her. Like them. It smelled only like him.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he whispered before sinking into a kiss that was viciously gentle.</p><p>He needed her, couldn\u2019t survive without her. And he needed the scent of her arousal, the flood of her pleasure, to fill his bed.</p><p>His room. His bed. And . . .</p><p>He looked at the woman who meant more to him than anything else, and thought, Mine.</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Theran looked at the man who walked into the breakfast room and thought, Predator.</p><p>Whatever mood was riding Daemon Sadi could have lethal repercussions for the rest of the males in this place. And judging by the way Beale held himself, as if a twitch at the wrong time could end with someone being gutted\u2014or worse\u2014the butler recognized the danger too. The difference between them was that Beale seemed to be offering something Sadi wanted, whereas he . . .</p><p>He dared give that cold, beautiful face a quick study before fixing his eyes on his plate.</p><p>In Dena Nehele, men had two ways to describe a man who had spent a vigorous night in bed: ridden hard or well used. A man who had been well used came to the breakfast table with a sated, lazy satisfaction. A man who had been ridden hard might have gotten some relief from the sex, but he was still edgy and looking for an excuse for a different kind of relief. And when a Warlord Prince went looking for that kind of relief, blood was spilled\u2014and too many friends and families ended up grieving for the dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sadi pulled out a chair and sat down across from him. Within moments Beale poured a cup of coffee for the Prince and, without asking, fixed a plate of food for the man.</p><p>\u201cIt will be ready in a few minutes,\u201d Beale said quietly.</p><p>Nodding, Sadi reached for the cup of black coffee.</p> <p>Undercurrents. Any man who lived in Terreille learned to recognize them. Even someone who had spent his life in the rogue camps.</p><p>There was concern\u2014and understanding\u2014in Beale\u2019s voice. The same concern Theran had heard in older men\u2019s voices when they\u2019d tried to offer support to a younger man who\u2019d been twisted up by bedroom games. And there was a moment before Beale left the room when Theran thought the butler would actually lay a comforting hand on Sadi\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>He recognized all the signs and knew what they meant, but who in the name of Hell would be brave enough\u2014or foolish enough\u2014to twist up a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince?</p><p>Sadi\u2019s wife.</p><p>That first exchange he\u2019d witnessed between Lady Angelline and Sadi had left no doubt that Daemon\u2019s attention became focused exclusively on her whenever she entered a room. He\u2019d figured it was because they were still in their first year of marriage\u2014a time when a man\u2019s thoughts didn\u2019t stray too far from the bed.</p> <p>Now he wondered. Who was Jaenelle Angelline? He\u2019d heard of Sadi\u2014who hadn\u2019t heard stories about the Sadist?\u2014but the Prince\u2019s wife, the adopted daughter of the former Warlord Prince of Dhemlan, was a Queen who didn\u2019t have a court and didn\u2019t rule anywhere that he could tell, not even the little village just down the road from the Hall. She wore a Jewel so peculiar he\u2019d never seen its like before. And everything about her outside of her life here at SaDiablo Hall was off-limits in terms of questions or conversation. Sadi had made that very clear when the three of them had dinner last night.</p><p>The other thing that was becoming clear was that no matter how they appeared for the servants and guests, no matter how Sadi was presented as the dominant power in Dhemlan, when the bedroom door closed at night, she had a Warlord Prince by the balls and wasn\u2019t afraid to squeeze.</p><p>Which brought him to the unpalatable conclusion that he was going to have to negotiate with Lady Angelline instead of Prince Sadi.</p><p>Then he looked up and realized those sleepy gold eyes were focused on him, had been focused on him all the time his thoughts had wandered\u2014and he had the terrifying feeling that Sadi was analyzing him right down to the last drop of blood and the smallest sliver of bone.</p><p>A sudden chill hung over the table, along with an unspoken warning: Keep your hands, and your thoughts, away from my wife.</p><p>\u201cPrince?\u201d</p> <p>Thank the Darkness, Theran thought as Daemon turned his head to look at the butler standing in the doorway.</p><p>Beale nodded once.</p><p>Daemon pushed his chair back, hesitated a moment, then called in a sheet of paper and dropped it on the table.</p><p>\u201cThose are the terms for having a Kaeleer Queen go to Dena Nehele,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cYou can look them over and give me your decision later.\u201d</p><p>Theran waited until Daemon was out of the room before letting out a shuddering sigh of relief.</p><p>Maybe if he told the butler he was going to take a walk around the estate, he could catch the Winds and reach the Keep before anyone realized he was gone. Maybe he could persuade that Hayllian librarian to help him go through the Gate and get back to Terreille.</p><p>Maybe you can throw away the one chance you\u2019ll have of finding someone who might be able to help your people. If you run away now, you run away from everyone. Jared and Blaed wouldn\u2019t have run. They would have been scared\u2014Hell\u2019s fire, they weren\u2019t stupid\u2014but they wouldn\u2019t have run.</p><p>And neither would he.</p> <p>Resigned to that much,Theran picked up the sheet of paper to look at the terms.</p><p>Carrying the loaded breakfast tray, Daemon paused outside the bedroom door.</p><p>Control it, damn you. Lock it away. Keep it leashed.</p><p>He was Daemon Sadi, Warlord Prince of Dhemlan, husband of Jaenelle Angelline. This morning, that was all he was. All he would allow himself to be.</p><p>Choked by that leash of self-control, he passed through the bedroom door and the shields still surrounding the room. When he\u2019d crept out of the room at the first hint of dawn, he could have changed the locks and shields to Red, which would have kept Jazen out but allowed Jaenelle to leave. He hadn\u2019t. So she was still in his bed, tucked under the covers, just as he\u2019d left her.</p><p>Not quite, he realized as he rounded the bed and saw her. She\u2019d gotten up long enough to pull the shift on\u2014and, most likely, to realize that he\u2019d locked her in the Consort\u2019s suite.</p><p>Her eyes opened. He wasn\u2019t sure who stared at him\u2014Jaenelle, his wife . . . or Witch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still deciding if I should be very pleased with you or very pissed off at you,\u201d she said.</p><p>Cautiously hopeful, because he hadn\u2019t thought there would be any chance of her being pleased, he raised the tray to catch her attention. \u201cI brought you some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you bring coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Of course he\u2019d brought coffee. He wouldn\u2019t have dared come back into the room if he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>He waited until she was sitting up and comfortably settled before he placed the tray across her lap.</p><p>A pointed look from her had him sitting gingerly on the edge of the bed. He didn\u2019t speak while she inspected the contents of the tray.</p><p>\u201cVegetable omelet and\u201d\u2014her eyebrows rose as she cut into the other one\u2014\u201cseafood omelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook a little persuading to convince Mrs. Beale to give up some of the shrimp and cold lobster she\u2019s using for the midday meal,\u201d he said.</p><p>She took a bite of the seafood\u2014and didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cDid you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d He was so scared of what would happen now, even the thought of food made him queasy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like an explanation,\u201d Jaenelle said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m sor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn explanation, Daemon, not an apology.\u201d</p><p>He swallowed the words and closed his eyes. An apology would have been easier.</p><p>\u201cSomething snapped in you last night, in a way I\u2019ve never seen before. I think I provoked it\u2014or was the final shove. I\u2019d like to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t provoke anything,\u201d he snarled as he met those sapphire eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t . . .\u201d He wouldn\u2019t let her take the blame for this, not even a crumb of blame. But how to explain? Where to begin?</p><p>She sipped her coffee and waited.</p><p>\u201cThe Consort\u2019s room is a kind of sanctuary,\u201d he began, choosing each word with care. \u201cA place for a man to let down his guard. A place where he doesn\u2019t have to perform.\u201d</p><p>She bit into a piece of toast and chewed slowly. \u201cDo you feel like you have to perform, Daemon?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. Never. Not with you. But . . . for most of my life I\u2019d had to perform, had to be on my guard except for the few precious hours each day that I had to myself. So even though things are different now\u2014so very different now\u2014I like having this private space. I\u2019ll come up here sometimes in the afternoons, stretch out on the bed for an hour, and let my mind wander.\u201d And know he was safe when he did it.</p><p>She cut off a piece of the seafood omelet and held up the fork.</p><p>His stomach cramped, but he kept his eyes on hers as he leaned forward and accepted the offering.</p><p>\u201cNothing wrong with wanting a place for yourself,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cThe cabin in Ebon Rih is my private place and seldom shared even with the people I love. So I do understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those years in Terreille, I had to fight hard to have a private place,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t say anything more, Jaenelle poked around the tray. \u201cAh. There is another fork.\u201d She handed it to him. \u201cEat in between the pauses.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure if being required to eat was a subtle punishment or confirmation that she was more shaken by last night than she wanted to admit. Otherwise, since she was a Healer, she would have known he couldn\u2019t eat.</p><p>He took a piece of toast, then a bite of the vegetable omelet. And swallowed hard to keep it down.</p><p>\u201cI needed a private place,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to stay sane, I needed a place. My room. My bed. Out of bounds to everyone.\u201d</p><p>She drank some coffee. Dabbed at her mouth with a napkin. \u201cYou could have asked me to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to leave.\u201d He kept his eyes fixed on the tray of food, no longer able to look at her. \u201cIn every court, there would always be one who wouldn\u2019t respect the boundaries, one who had to be the lesson to the others. Always one little bitch who thought I would bend in private in ways I wouldn\u2019t bend in public. And there she would be one night, dressed to arouse, rubbing her stink on my bed.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle flinched.</p><p>\u201cI hurt them, Jaenelle. Even when I let them live, I hurt them. They were violating what little peace I could make for myself, trying to create a need, a desire, a physical response that would have condemned me to a more savage kind of slavery once Dorothea found out I was capable of being aroused. And in a way those little bitches succeeded. They created a need to hurt them, a desire to inflict pain. As for physical response, they didn\u2019t get the one they wanted, but they got one\u2014and they lived with the nightmares for the rest of their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaemon,\u201d Jaenelle said gently.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop now. \u201cThen last night, talking to Theran, remembering Jared and the last time I saw him\u2014and the years that followed. Those weren\u2019t easy years for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose memories were riding you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And then I was here, in my room, my private space, trying to settle my feelings, talking to you but not paying attention to you. Listening to you, but not paying attention while I was getting undressed, still steeped in that other time in my life. And then I turned around. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd saw a memory.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA thousand memories.\u201d Daemon swallowed hard. \u201cI saw the body, but not the face. I saw the clothes, but not the person who wore them. And my own worst nightmare from those years happened. I was so completely aroused I couldn\u2019t turn away from what I wanted. What I needed. It was like being thrown into the rut without any warning. And then you moved as if you were going to leave, and\u2014\u201d He clamped his teeth together.</p><p>Jaenelle refilled the coffee cup, taking her time as she added cream and sugar. \u201cYou scared me last night.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis was more than the rut, Daemon.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cYou know who I am when you\u2019re caught in the rut. Last night . . . I wasn\u2019t sure you knew who was under you\u2014or cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cNot until I touched you. And then . . .\u201d The smell of last night filled the room, and every thought encouraged his body to remember what he\u2019d done while she was under him. Every thought encouraged the part of his nature he tried so hard to keep leashed to wake up again, play again, dance with her again.</p><p>After a long silence, Jaenelle said, \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I touched you, when I realized where we were and that I was aroused because it was you, I had one thought: This was my room, my bed, and you were . . . mine. And no one was going to stop me from having you. Nothing was going to stop me from satisfying every need.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the coffee cup, then reconsidered and took another bite of omelet.</p> <p>\u201cOnce I knew it was you,\u201d he said softly,\u201call the things I had hated for so many years were the things I now wanted. I wanted your scent on my sheets. I wanted to lay in this bed on other nights and remember having you.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t comment, he poked at the food, eating to have something to do.</p><p>Finally she said with dry amusement,\u201cYou were pretty single-minded last night. Mine, mine, mine. I guess this really did jab at the possessive side of your nature, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a laugh. \u201cI guess it did.\u201d</p><p>She pinched a bit of the shift between thumb and forefinger. \u201cAs for this, I\u2019m sorry it brought back bad memories. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWear it again? Please?\u201d</p> <p>She looked wary.</p><p>He touched her hand briefly, the first contact he\u2019d made since he\u2019d walked back into the room. \u201cBad timing. If I\u2019d seen you in those clothes in your bedroom or here on any other night . . . Well, I can\u2019t say the outcome would have been different, but the reasons I reacted to the clothes would have been.\u201d</p><p>Which made him wonder about something that hadn\u2019t occurred to him last night. \u201cWhy were you wearing that?\u201d</p><p>She blushed. Shrugged. Fiddled with the coffee cup.</p><p>He waited, a patient predator.</p><p>\u201cI was reading a story and when the woman wore something like this, the man . . .\u201d Another shrug. More fiddling.</p><p>He tried to remember what she\u2019d been reading lately, but couldn\u2019t recall a title. \u201cMaybe I should read that book to get a few ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need any ideas.\u201d</p> <p>He was pretty sure that was a compliment.</p><p>Since he was feeling easier and the food was there in front of him, he ate some more.</p><p>\u201cWill you wear it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo spend the night in this room or the other bedroom?\u201d Jaenelle asked softly.</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d he answered, just as softly.</p><p>A slow, mischievous smile. \u201cInstead of negotiating about which bed to use, maybe we should just flip a coin to see who gets to be on top.\u201d</p><p>Last night he\u2019d dominated, possessed, kept her under his body and under his control. Now he had a sudden image of her riding him, her body a teasing shadow covered by the shift, her legs sheathed in those sheer white stockings, his fingers moving up her legs to the damp skin above the stockings, moving up to the wet heat that sheathed him.</p><p>That image stayed in his mind, but the tone changed, becoming a dark, spicy thrill when she realized she wasn\u2019t the one in control, that he was still . . .</p><p>He jerked back, snarling, as fingers snapped in front of his face.</p><p>Jaenelle stared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where your brain went just now, but, Mother Night, Daemon, judging by the way your eyes glazed, we don\u2019t have time for whatever you were thinking.\u201d</p><p>They had all the time they wanted. Who would dare interrupt them?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Dharo today, remember?\u201d</p><p>Leave? She was going to leave?</p><p>\u201cDaemon. You have a guest, remember?\u201d</p><p>Theran. Stranger. Male. Rival.</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d</p><p>Her hand clamped over his wrist. Physically, he could break the hold without effort. But her touch, her will, was the only chain strong enough to keep him leashed.</p><p>He shifted on the bed, trying to find a comfortable position, trying not to snarl at her for denying him the right to eliminate a rival.</p><p>She blew out a breath and kept her hand clamped on his wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to settle if I stay here today, and if you don\u2019t settle, Prince Theran is going to end up dead.\u201d</p><p>She was right, and they both knew it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you need to get out of this room until it\u2019s been cleaned and aired.\u201d</p><p>She was right about that too. But . . .</p><p>He wasn\u2019t Daemon anymore. Not completely. That other side of him was swimming close to the surface, wanting to dance, wanting to play, wanting to give her a little taste of fear while he aroused her body and produced a banquet of climaxes ranging from wild screams to soft, helpless moans.</p><p>He caught the back of her neck and pulled her forward gently, carefully, implacably. His mouth opened and hovered a breath away from hers.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d Not a request. A purring command.</p><p>She trembled a little as her mouth touched his. As her tongue touched his.</p><p>A soft kiss. A lingering kiss that soothed with the promise of fire at the end of the day.</p><p>He eased back and shoved his brain and libido\u2014and the Sadist\u2014away from all the thoughts of what his body wanted to do with hers.</p><p>\u201cAm I forgiven?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFor last night? Yes. For eating the last bite of the seafood omelet? I\u2019ll have to think about that.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the tray and realized they\u2019d done a fair job of cleaning the plates. \u201cI didn\u2019t drink any of the coffee,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Jaenelle bared her teeth in a feral smile and lightly pinched his cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s why you still have all your fingers.\u201d</p><p>Daemon stepped out of the Consort\u2019s suite and felt the dark presence in the rooms across the corridor. He shivered as he stared at the door to his father\u2019s sitting room.</p><p>As much as he\u2019d told Jaenelle in an effort to explain last night, there was so much more he hadn\u2019t said. Couldn\u2019t say. Not to her.</p><p>For one thing, he wasn\u2019t stable, wasn\u2019t sure he could be trusted around her\u2014and that scared him to the bone.</p><p>He crossed the corridor, knocked on the door, and waited for his father\u2019s deep voice to give him permission to enter. Barely pausing to close the door, he hurried to the chair where Saetan was reading a book, and sank to his knees.</p><p>\u201cFather.\u201d</p><p>Saetan closed the book, then removed and vanished his half-moon glasses. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s lack of anger and her willingness to understand had helped him maintain a crust of calm, a thin layer of control, that had hidden a seething ugliness for a little while.</p><p>But here, now, he faced a man who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to punish him if he needed to be punished, who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to hurt him if that was needed to pay the debt. Who would understand the depth of what he\u2019d done wrong.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d he said, his voice breaking. \u201cI hurt Jaenelle. I scared Jaenelle.\u201d Those words would mean little to most people, but Saetan would know what it would take to frighten Witch.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>He told Saetan everything. Everything. And when he was done, he pressed his face against his father\u2019s legs . . . and wept.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful, Saetan thought as he stroked Daemon\u2019s hair, the movement of his hand weaving a soothing spell around his son.</p><p>It could have been worse. Could have been much worse. This was a painful reminder that Daemon\u2019s mind and sanity had been shattered twice\u2014and no matter how strong the man, no matter how well he healed, there were always scars, always permanent damage. But he could help his boy deal with the fears stemming from last night.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to listen?\u201d Saetan asked quietly.</p><p>What worried him was the certainty that if he told Daemon to strip and lie on the floor to be whipped until there wasn\u2019t any skin left on his back, Daemon wouldn\u2019t hesitate, wouldn\u2019t question\u2014as long as the punishment came with the promise that Jaenelle would truly forgive him for last night.</p><p>Daemon nodded, his face still pressed against Saetan\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because Jaenelle asked me to come\u2014not because she needed me, but because you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs a Healer,\u201d Daemon whispered.</p><p>And you need more than a Healer. And the witch who had the skill to mend what had been broken was currently in the suite across the hall. \u201cI\u2019ll see to it, and I will tell you what is needed. I\u2019ll also find something to do with your guest.\u201d And wouldn\u2019t that be fun?</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, giving Daemon\u2019s hair a tweak, \u201cyou need some rest, so I want you to wash your face, strip down, and get into my bed.\u201d</p><p>He felt the jolt, recognized the reason. A Warlord Prince was what he was, and letting another male in his bed for any reason was an unspoken testimony of love. His bed had been forbidden ground, but every one of his boys had been allowed to have a nap there when they were feeling shaky or heartsore. Sometimes he had joined them, had held them while they whispered their little hurts and secrets; sometimes he sat in a chair by the bed, reading. Either way, his boys knew they were safe there, protected there. And sometimes knowing that was all they needed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Daemon asked, with just enough doubt to rip at Saetan\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cReally. I\u2019ll even read you a story after I take care of a couple of things. Go on, now.\u201d</p><p>Daemon got to his feet, unable to hide how shaky he was physically and emotionally. He swallowed once, twice. Then he rushed to the bathroom and slammed the door shut.</p> <p>A moment later, aural shields went up around the bathroom to hide the sounds of Daemon being violently sick.</p><p>Sighing, Saetan went across the hall and knocked on the door to Jaenelle\u2019s sitting room.</p><p>Fresh from a bath, she was bundled in a robe, her golden hair still damp. He saw no fear in the sapphire eyes that assessed him, but he did see worry.</p><p>Using Craft, he floated a footstool over to her chair and sat down in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p> <p>\u201cFirst things first.

He gave me a choice, Saetan. He asked me to stay, but he told me I could go. I chose to stay.\u201d</p><p>Sick relief washed through Saetan. Daemon hadn\u2019t remembered giving her a choice, and even though the word had remained unspoken, the fear that he\u2019d crossed an unforgivable line had been in every word Daemon had said.</p><p>\u201cYou need to see a Healer, witch-child.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am a Healer.\u201d</p><p>And a Black Widow and a Queen. One of the three witches in all of Kaeleer who had a triple gift.</p><p>\u201cThen I need an accurate list of your injuries.\u201d Jaenelle was his adopted daughter; Daemon was his son. More than that, he had been her Steward. This wouldn\u2019t be comfortable for either of them, but they were going to have this conversation. \u201cBefore you try to shrug this off because you\u2019d rather not be frank with me, you should keep in mind that whatever broke in Daemon last night may stay broken unless it\u2019s fixed in a hurry, and if it stays broken, your husband may not be able to do more than imagine making love to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he really know what happened last night?\u201d</p><p>Saetan frowned. \u201cI had the impression he explained some of this to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did.\u201d Jaenelle studied him for a moment, then pushed back the sleeves of her robe and held out her wrists.</p><p>Ugly bruises. His own wrists ached in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the worst of it,\u201d Jaenelle said, smoothing the sleeves back down. \u201cThere are a few other bruises from love bites, but considering where they\u2019re located, I\u2019m not going to show you.\u201d</p> <p>On the basis of Daemon\u2019s fears, he\u2019d been prepared for something far more serious, and he found himself comforted by Jaenelle\u2019s tone of amused snippiness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bit sore, but that has to do with quantity, not his temper, and at any other time, he\u2019d be smugly sympathetic about that,\u201d Jaenelle continued. \u201cAnd between the exercise I got with Nighthawk and Daemon, my thighs are sore enough that I\u2019m not interested in riding anything for a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Saetan gave in to the smile tugging his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded. Couldn\u2019t be all of it. \u201cHe scared you. That\u2019s the sticking point for him. He scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Jaenelle replied quietly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know who I was, Saetan. He didn\u2019t know where he was. He was caught in some twisting memory, and when I realized that, I also realized that if he really tried to hurt me, I was going to have to hurt him, because he would be able to live with a physical injury much easier than he could live with the knowledge that he\u2019d done more than give me a couple of unintentional bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you have hurt him?\u201d Saetan asked. \u201cAre you strong enough that you could have stopped him?\u201d</p><p>She folded her right hand into a loose fist. When she opened her hand . . .</p><p>Her fingers no longer had human nails. These were cat claws, the kind that could do serious damage with even a glancing blow.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Saetan said softly. A physical wound, even a permanently crippling one, would have been less destructive for Daemon. She had known that\u2014and her choice of weapon would have shocked any man back into the present.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Jaenelle closed her right hand, then fluffed her hair with her normal fingers. \u201cI\u2019m heading out to Dharo. Aaron should be here by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He kept his voice carefully neutral, but he wondered if Jaenelle was being honest about her own emotional state. He understood her summoning him in the early-morning hours so that he would be here when Daemon most needed him, but summoning Aaron could indicate a need to escape.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Those sapphire eyes looked through him\u2014and understood everything he didn\u2019t say. \u201cThe purpose of the visit has changed, but the arrangements were made several days ago. I\u2019m not hurt, Papa. I promise you. I\u2019m . . . shaky. I won\u2019t deny that. But I\u2019m not hurt.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She laid her hand on his. \u201cWill you stay over today? Be here for him? I think you can do more to help him heal right now than I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled around his. \u201cDaemon can\u2019t go back to Terreille. In memory of a friend, he\u2019ll try to do what\u2019s right, but he can\u2019t go back to Terreille.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has no defense against the memories anymore, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. His mind and his sanity are intact. He may feel broken right now, but that\u2019s a surface feeling, an emotion. Last night didn\u2019t actually break him. I did descend into the abyss during one of the times he fell asleep, and I made a thorough assessment of his mind, so I\u2019m sure of that. But he\u2019s going to be fragile for a while. If it\u2019s needed, Lucivar can go to Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Lucivar goes to Dena Nehele, he\u2019ll walk in ready to fight.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle huffed. \u201cThat\u2019s not new. Lucivar walks into every place ready to fight.\u201d</p><p>Saetan laughed softly. Hard to deny the truth about his Eyrien son\u2019s temper. \u201cAll right.\u201d Raising her hand, he kissed her knuckles, then let her go. \u201cYou head out to Dharo. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll look after our guest?\u201d Jaenelle asked knowingly.</p><p>\u201cThat I will. But first I\u2019m going to read my boy a story. I had thought of reading him Unicorn to the Rescue! or Sceltie Saves the Day\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s silvery, velvet-coated laugh eased his heart and vanished his concern about this child.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but I don\u2019t think he\u2019d appreciate the humor of being read a story appropriate for his nephew,\u201d he finished. \u201cAt least, not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he would. Not today.\u201d</p><p>When their laughter faded, Jaenelle called in a small wooden frame Black Widows used to hold their tangled webs. \u201cThat room needs to be cleaned and aired before Daemon can go back in. I think Helene will find this useful. Marian and I have been working on a way to cleanse a bedroom after a Warlord Prince goes through a rut. The vial is opened with a basic housekeeping spell. Once it\u2019s triggered, the web will absorb the psychic scents in the room, while the oil in the vial absorbs the physical odors. The whole thing takes a couple of hours. When it\u2019s done, the spider silk of the web will look thick and greasy. Same with the oil. We haven\u2019t figured out how to cleanse the frame or vial after it\u2019s been used, so the whole thing should be put in a shield and burned with witchfire, then buried so the ash doesn\u2019t drift on the Wind.\u201d</p><p>He had to marvel that no one else had ever thought of this. Of course, there probably hadn\u2019t been that many friendships between Black Widows and hearth witches, and until Marian and Jaenelle started working together to create specific spells, no one, to his knowledge, had thought to combine those two kinds of Craft.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Helene will find this useful.\u201d Setting it aside a moment, he asked about something that had troubled him in Daemon\u2019s story. \u201cWitch-child, you must have known Daemon wasn\u2019t in the best frame of mind. Why did you wear something that . . . ?\u201d If she weren\u2019t his daughter and his Queen, he wouldn\u2019t have any trouble in phrasing the question.</p><p>\u201cWhy did I wear an invitation?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She fluffed her golden hair. The look she gave him was a little amused and embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s been said that when a man is feeling a bit broody about something, sometimes he wants sex as a comfort but doesn\u2019t feel secure enough to ask for it.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Jaenelle\u2019s coven exchanging confidences about their husbands and/or lovers made him want to run and hide, but he just sat there and nodded.</p><p>\u201cI thought Daemon was feeling moody about Jared, about remembering a friend who was gone, but I hadn\u2019t realized it was more than that until it was too late. Anyway, I was reading a story, and the clothes the woman was wearing had caught the man\u2019s interest, so . . .\u201d Jaenelle shrugged. \u201cI knew if Daemon wasn\u2019t interested, he wouldn\u2019t notice the clothes and would be oblivious to the invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d Saetan blinked, sure he\u2019d misheard. \u201cDaemon wouldn\u2019t notice what you were wearing? Daemon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitch-child . . .\u201d He shook his head. \u201cMaybe he pretends not to see, but he does notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore Surreal went back to Ebon Rih, we went shopping in Amdarh, and she picked out some things that she swore would make Daemon\u2019s tongue hit his toes and have his eyes roll back in his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely picture,\u201d Saetan muttered.</p><p>\u201cSo I was trying the outfit on later that evening and wondering if I really had the nerve to wear it when Daemon walked into the bedroom. I don\u2019t remember what he\u2019d been working on that day, but he looked exhausted. Before I could say anything, he stared at me for a moment, then told me I wasn\u2019t dressed warmly enough for the weather since a bad winter storm had hit a couple of hours before. He bundled me up in his winter robe, stuffed my feet in two pairs of socks\u2014a pair of his over a pair of mine\u2014made us both a hot drink, tucked us into bed, and promptly fell asleep.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saetan pressed his lips together to hide his smile. Daemon\u2019s robe. Daemon\u2019s socks. The clues had been there, but neither Jaenelle nor Daemon had recognized the significance.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only time it\u2019s happened,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cIt\u2019s a comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p> <p>So much understanding in those sapphire eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want him to feel like sex is a duty. The fact that he\u2019s sometimes blind to an invitation means he doesn\u2019t feel obliged to perform.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you wear that outfit on another night?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated a long time. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you get the response Surreal said you would?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p> <p>But judging by the sudden color flaming her cheeks, she had definitely gotten a response.</p><p>He stood up, kissed her forehead, picked up the frame with the web, and walked to the door. Then he turned back. \u201cAre you sure there are no other injuries, witch-child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>That assurance helped, especially when he walked out of Jaenelle\u2019s sitting room and found Beale, Helene, and Jazen standing in the doorway of the Consort\u2019s bedroom, a look of shock on their faces.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d he asked softly. When they turned toward him, he raised a finger to his lips. \u201cPrince Sadi is in my suite. It would be best not to disturb him.\u201d</p><p>Helene looked from him to the bedroom and back again. \u201cWas anyone hurt?\u201d she asked in a hushed voice.</p> <p>They stepped aside for him, and when he stood in that doorway, he understood the question.</p><p>Nothing outwardly wrong with the room. Nothing broken or damaged. Even the bed didn\u2019t look unduly messy.</p><p>But the psychic scents in the room, combined with the muskiness of sex, made his own body tighten. Rage and fear filled the room, along with a hatred so deep it caught in the back of the throat like a bitter mist. If he\u2019d walked into that room without already knowing both people were safe and unharmed, he would have been tearing the Hall apart to find Daemon and Jaenelle, certain one or both would be desperately hurt.</p><p>And there was something under all those other scents that he recognized, that he\u2014and Daemon\u2014would have to deal with.</p><p>But not yet. Not until his boy was feeling steady again.</p><p>He turned his back on the room and gave Helene the frame that held the cleansing web, and explained what it would do.</p><p>\u201cPlease give my thanks to the Ladies,\u201d Helene said. \u201cThis will help to clean the room.\u201d She looked at Beale and Jazen. \u201cThe fewer women in the room right now, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help with the cleaning,\u201d Jazen said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make sure the clothes don\u2019t need to be aired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll send up Holt to assist,\u201d Beale said.</p><p>Helene turned to Saetan. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the room done in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cJazen, leave a complete change of clothes in my sitting room for the Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeale? Is there something else that needs my attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Aaron is down in the breakfast room, waiting for Lady Angelline,\u201d Beale said. \u201cThe Prince\u2019s guest is pacing in the formal receiving room, muttering to himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInform Prince Theran that someone will be available in an hour if he wants to discuss anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, High Lord.\u201d</p><p>There was a look in Beale\u2019s eyes that told him plainly enough that the butler wasn\u2019t going to inform Theran about who would be available for that discussion.</p><p>What was it about the Dena Nehele Warlord Prince that raised the hackles of Kaeleer males?</p><p>Still wondering about that, he walked back into his bedroom and found Daemon tucked in his bed. The body belonged to a full-grown man, but the eyes that watched him, so full of despair, belonged to a boy.</p><p>He sat on the side of the bed. \u201cShe\u2019s all right,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIn better shape than you are, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were bruises,\u201d Daemon whispered. \u201cOn her wrists. I saw them.\u201d</p><p>Saetan nodded. \u201cYes, there are. And there are a few love bites, which I didn\u2019t see. And her leg muscles are sore, but you and Nighthawk are being given equal blame for those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>The smallest twitch of lips; a hint of amusement in the golden eyes; the tight muscles in the shoulders beginning to relax one breath at a time.</p><p>He knew the signs, had watched this son struggle to repair himself once before when he\u2019d believed Jaenelle had been lost forever.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cyou and Nighthawk may be equally to blame for the sore muscles, but you\u2019re the only one with hands, so I suggest that you be the one who offers to give Jaenelle a back rub this evening.\u201d</p><p>An unspoken question hung in the air. He waited.</p><p>Finally Daemon gave him the tiniest nod. The Steward of the Dark Court wouldn\u2019t tell the Consort to take care of the Queen if there was any doubt about the Consort\u2019s welcome.</p><p>Having done as much as could be done for the moment, Saetan called in a book, opened it to the table of contents, and pointed to the titles of two stories. \u201cWhich one would you like to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d</p><p>The answer made his heart ache\u2014and also gave him hope that Jaenelle was right and Daemon was emotionally battered right now but not truly broken.</p><p>Daemon didn\u2019t remember giving the same answer so many times as a boy that it had become a ritual between them. But he did. And because he remembered, he called in his half-moon glasses, took his time settling them on his nose just so, and completed the ritual with the same words he\u2019d always said. \u201cYes, I think we can read both this time.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Agitated and feeling reckless, Theran rapped on the study door and walked in before he was invited.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Sadi. Are you serious about these conditions you\u2019ve set?\u201d</p><p>The man sitting behind the blackwood desk wasn\u2019t Daemon Sadi. It was the pissy old cock from the Keep. The assistant historian /librarian\u2014who no longer looked like a somewhat benign clerk whose Red Jewels and caste could, mostly, be ignored.</p><p>Now he saw the resemblance between Sadi and the Hayllian Warlord Prince, who set a piece of paper on the desk and removed the half-moon glasses, whose gold eyes never left Theran\u2019s face.</p><p>Fear shuddered through Theran when he noticed the Warlord Prince\u2019s right hand, with its long, black-tinted nails and the Black-Jeweled ring.</p><p>\u201cYou managed to hone my temper before I walked into that sitting room at the Keep, so we never did finish the introductions. I\u2019m Saetan Daemon SaDiablo, the former Warlord Prince of Dhemlan\u2014and still the High Lord of Hell.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s legs buckled. He hit the edge of the chair in front of the desk and grabbed the arms to push himself back in the seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d What was he supposed to say to the High Lord? Apologize for not being more courteous when he\u2019d been at the Keep?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming by the way you entered the room that you want to discuss the terms Prince Sadi set for having a Kaeleer Queen rule Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadi . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs indisposed this morning. You may discuss this with me.\u201d</p><p>May the Darkness have mercy. All he wanted right now was to get out of this room.</p><p>Jared wouldn\u2019t have run. Blaed wouldn\u2019t have run.</p><p>\u201cThe terms are . . .\u201d Sadi had accepted the position of Warlord Prince of Dhemlan a few months after his father resigned. Theran remembered hearing that last night at dinner. How was he supposed to voice his objections to the terms without sounding like he was criticizing the son? Because this was one father he did not want to offend.</p><p>\u201cUnreasonable? Insulting? Barbed?\u201d Saetan offered with a hint of a sharp smile. \u201cEverything has a price, Prince Grayhaven. The man who wrote up these terms has a good understanding of Terreille. A better understanding than you do, since yours, I suspect, is confined to your own Territory. Prince Sadi also has a fine understanding of how the males in Kaeleer, especially the Warlord Princes, respond to any threat to a female, let alone a Queen. You may feel hobbled by these terms, but they were thought through carefully and are designed to protect your people as well as the Queen who comes to rule.\u201d</p><p>Realizing he\u2019d dropped the paper when he\u2019d grabbed for the chair,Theran retrieved it and stared at the list of conditions.</p><p>\u201cA year? She only stays a year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year is enough time for both of you to know if your people can accept an outsider ruling over them\u2014and if your people really want to go back to following the Old Ways of the Blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we didn\u2019t want to go back to living the way we did when the Gray Lady ruled, we would have settled for . . .\u201d For one of the Queens we have\u2014who would destroy what\u2019s left of us as surely as one of Dorothea\u2019s pet Queens would have done.</p><p>Theran slumped in the chair, his hands dangling between his knees. \u201cGrayhaven is my family\u2019s home\u2014and my inheritance. What\u2019s left of it. She can have the use of it. As for a tithe . . . Hell\u2019s fire. We\u2019re just trying to get enough food planted and harvested so that everyone has enough to eat this winter. The Queens who ruled bled the land and the people dry. I told Sadi that last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t change what is needed for a Queen\u2019s court,\u201d Saetan said quietly. \u201cShe deserves something for her effort, and the court needs some way to pay for its expenses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t the tithe be paid in goods and services?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cIf the Queen and the First Circle are agreeable to that condition, yes, a high percentage of the tithe could be done that way.\u201d</p><p>Hopeful that there might be more flexibility to these terms than he\u2019d first thought, Theran looked at the sheet of paper again. \u201cInspections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd weekly reports from the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does she have to answer to anyone? And why should my people be treated like children who get surprise tests to see if we\u2019ve learned our manners?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saetan leaned back, steepled his fingers, and rested his forefingers against his chin. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have any manners. That\u2019s one of the reasons you\u2019re here. You want something you don\u2019t remember, something your people don\u2019t remember. The inspections aren\u2019t to test you; they\u2019re to appease the Warlord Princes from the Queen\u2019s home. Since you belong to that caste, you shouldn\u2019t be so dismissive of the power and temper that could land on your doorstep with the intention to kill. As for the Queen\u2019s weekly reports, those, too, are to offer reassurance and are in place of having armed escorts living with her in Dena Nehele.\u201d He paused. \u201cI should say armed escorts from her home Territory. Providing sufficient escorts for her protection is your responsibility. Gathering the men and women who will form the First Circle is your responsibility. And assuring the Queen\u2019s physical and emotional well-being is also your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>Theran felt the blood drain from his face. He\u2019d escaped all that. By living with Talon, by hiding in the mountains so the pet Queens couldn\u2019t control the last male in the Grayhaven bloodline, he\u2019d escaped that kind of service.</p><p>\u201cAssess your skills, Prince,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cYou will be one of the male triangle that serves the Queen most intimately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConsort?\u201d Theran choked on the word. \u201cYou expect me to service\u2014\u201d</p><p>Saetan laughed, and the undercurrent of violence in the sound made Theran shiver.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being presumptuous, puppy. No Kaeleer male is going to tolerate an assumption that any male in Terreille has a right to the Queen\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst Escort,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cSame duties for the most part, up until you reach the bedroom door. As First Escort, you don\u2019t cross the threshold. You don\u2019t serve in bed. However, if being First Escort isn\u2019t a service you can perform, you can stand as Master of the Guard or Steward\u2014providing the other males in the First Circle will accept you in one of those positions.\u201d</p> <p>Relief shuddered through him.</p><p>\u201cBut if a Queen does agree to go back with you and rule your people, you will be held responsible for her care,Theran. Make no mistake about that. And if that care is found wanting, you will answer to Kaeleer. Make no mistake about that either. The Warlord Princes here may sympathize with what you want to do for your Territory. They may even be willing to help. But if they think you\u2019re mistreating or endangering a Queen who comes from the Shadow Realm, they won\u2019t hesitate to destroy you and your people. They will wipe you out of existence more thoroughly than Dorothea ever could. Do we understand one another?\u201d</p><p>He had to swallow to get his heart out of his throat. \u201cYes, High Lord. We understand one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted. Lady Angelline has gone to talk to a Queen who may be interested in helping your people. She\u2019ll be back for dinner. Since you have the time, I suggest\u2014\u201d Saetan frowned at the door.</p><p>Theran turned his head to catch the sound. Yes, there it was again. Something scratching at the door.</p><p>Saetan raised one hand. The study door swung open, and a small brown and white dog trotted into the room and stopped near Theran\u2019s chair.</p> <p>He\u2019d never had a dog. Always liked them, liked petting them when he was in a village, but the rogue camps in the mountains were hidden places, and while a dog might have alerted them to a stranger\u2019s presence, its barking could also have revealed the location of the camp to an enemy.</p><p>The dog didn\u2019t come quite close enough for a casual pat, but it did seem interested in him.</p><p>\u201cVae,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Wondering why the High Lord sounded cautious, Theran looked at the dog more carefully. A glint of something in the ruff. A gold chain and . . .</p><p>His heart gave one hard bump before he recognized his mistake. For a moment, he thought someone had put a Purple Dusk Jewel on the dog, but it was just an amethyst, just someone thinking he was being clever by making it look like the dog wore a Jewel.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you and Lady Vae walk down to the village?\u201d Saetan said. \u201cSince the people in Halaway live by the Old Ways, spending a few hours there would give you a good idea of what would be expected from your people.\u201d</p><p>*Walkies? I like walkies!*</p><p>The voice sounded like a young girl\u2019s, but he didn\u2019t actually hear it. It rang inside his head, just outside his inner barriers, as if someone had communicated on a psychic thread. But the only other being in the room besides him and the High Lord was . . .</p> <p>*He does not talk? He is not trained?*</p><p>\u201cHis training has just started.\u201d Saetan\u2019s mouth curved in a maliciously amused smile. \u201cLady Vae is a kindred Sceltie. A Purple Dusk witch.\u201d</p><p>Theran felt the blood draining out of his head. \u201cKindred? Witch?\u201d That Jewel he\u2019d seen was real? This dog was the same rank as his Birthright Jewel?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Saetan crooned. \u201cI think Vae will be the perfect escort for you.\u201d</p><p>*He is male and foolish. I will protect him.*</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201dA pause. \u201cIs there anything else you wanted to discuss right now, Prince Theran?\u201d</p><p>He knew a dismissal when he heard one, but his legs felt like overstretched taffy and it took him a couple of tries to get out of the chair. He vanished the paper with the conditions his people would have to agree to, and as he walked toward the door, he realized the dog was waiting for him.</p><p>*I can pass through doors,Vae said. *I know my Craft. But you are in training, so I will wait for you to open the door.*</p><p>As he stepped into the great hall and the study door closed behind him, he heard the High Lord of Hell laugh.</p><p>Cassidy stared at Jaenelle Angelline, then looked at her cousin Aaron, who was pacing the length of the sitting room in her parents\u2019 house.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both teasing,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThis is a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it were,\u201d Aaron growled. \u201cBut she\u2019s serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a minor Queen. I wear a Rose Jewel. I\u2019ve never ruled anything larger than a small village.\u201d Which no one else had wanted until a new, young Queen needed a place to rule to gain credentials for something better. \u201cAaron, tell her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Aaron replied. \u201cAll the way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy entire First Circle resigned and broke the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were idiots,\u201d Aaron growled.</p><p>\u201cAnd because they were idiots, you\u2019re now available to help a people who need you,\u201d Jaenelle said calmly.</p><p>\u201cThey need a strong Queen,\u201d Cassidy argued.</p><p>\u201cYou are a strong Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need a . . . a polished Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey need a Queen who knows the Old Ways, who lives by the Old Ways, who knows Protocol, and who knows how to rule fairly,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cThey need someone like you, Cassidy.\u201d She placed one hand over Cassidy\u2019s. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to look into those sapphire eyes. They saw too much. Understood too much. But she obeyed because it didn\u2019t matter if Jaenelle officially ruled or not. She was still the Queen. And no one disobeyed Witch.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t going to understand you,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cMost of them aren\u2019t going to see who you really are. They\u2019ll be disappointed by the surface.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy winced\u2014and winced again when Aaron snarled his opinion of her former court.</p><p>\u201cMost, Cassidy. But some will see who you are as a woman, and in time the others will appreciate who you are as a Queen. You can do this. I wouldn\u2019t be here if I had any doubts about that.\u201d Jaenelle patted her hand and sat back. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a few days to think about it.\u201d</p><p>Living in a strange Territory. In a different Realm. In Terreille. People didn\u2019t go to Terreille. They ran from Terreille.</p><p>But she could make a difference to these people. She could help them remember who they were, help them rebuild.</p><p>\u201cHow long would I be gone?\u201d Cassidy asked. Would she ever see her family again? Could she go home to visit, to reassure her parents that she was all right?</p><p>\u201cThere would have to be terms, conditions,\u201d Aaron said as he continued to pace. \u201cWe are not letting her go to that damn Realm without some assurances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is \u2018we\u2019?\u201d Cassidy asked, bristling. \u201cNo one makes decisions about my life except me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink again,\u201d Aaron snapped.</p><p>Cassidy blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re a distant cousin!\u201d</p><p>*Don\u2019t yank that leash,* Jaenelle warned on a distaff thread.</p><p>*When it comes to family,Warlord Princes are only as distant as they choose to be. He\u2019s already angry about your former court and didn\u2019t trust himself to come here on his own.*</p><p>Cassidy glanced at Aaron, then fixed her eyes on the carpet between her feet. She\u2019d been curious when she\u2019d received Aaron\u2019s note, requesting a visit at a specific day and time, but she\u2019d thought he was going to give her a pat on the shoulder and a little sympathy about losing the court. Then, when Jaenelle showed up with him and began telling her about Dena Nehele, she hadn\u2019t been sure what to think about the visit. But it hadn\u2019t occurred to her that Aaron, who really was a distant cousin, would be angry enough to come to Dharo with the intention of going after the males from her former First Circle.</p><p>*You weren\u2019t aware that Aaron has already had a \u201cdiscussion\u201d with Sabrina about your court breaking for the reasons it did?* Jaenelle asked.</p><p>*No.* Thank the Darkness. *What kind of discussion?*</p><p>*The kind that ended with them yelling at each other.*</p><p>Aaron had yelled at the Queen of Dharo\u2014who was a member of Jaenelle\u2019s coven and a longtime friend of his\u2014because of her? Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cI believe Daemon has already drafted a list of terms,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cAnd the High Lord is reviewing it.\u201d</p><p>Aaron finally stopped pacing. \u201cDaemon wrote the terms? The males will have to answer to him?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jaenelle nodded. \u201cOr the High Lord. Or both.\u201d</p><p>Aaron sat in a chair, all his tension and temper gone. Cassidy, however, felt a lot more nervous. Knowing two Black-Jeweled Warlord Princes\u2014the two most powerful males in the entire history of the Blood\u2014were taking an interest in her life wasn\u2019t a pleasant feeling.</p><p>She looked up in time to see Jaenelle\u2019s lips twitch in a knowing smile.</p> <p>Of course, long-distance interest would be easier than living in the same house with either man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see a copy of those terms,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll arrange for that,\u201d Jaenelle replied. Then she slanted a look at Aaron. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure your father\u2014and the other males in your family\u2014will want an opportunity to voice their opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t we skip that part?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d Jaenelle said cheerfully. She stood up. \u201cWell. You have plenty to think about. If you decide to accept the challenge, come to the Keep a week from today.\u201d</p> <p>Cassidy rose to see them out. \u201cWho else have you asked to consider this?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle just looked at her\u2014and Cassidy felt a shiver run down her spine.</p><p>\u201cI do not idly weave a tangled web of dreams and visions, Lady Cassidy,\u201d Jaenelle said with a hint of midnight and lightning in her voice. \u201cWithin the next year, Dena Nehele will begin to heal or it will break beyond all saving. You\u2019re my choice to stand as their Queen. Whether you will be their choice . . . That is up to them. Whether you go . . . That is up to you.\u201d</p><p>She was Witch\u2019s choice. Because of a web of dreams and visions. How could she not try?</p><p>\u201cIn that case, Lady,\u201d Cassidy said, \u201cI\u2019ll see you in seven days.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p> <p>KAELEER</p><p>*Theran? Theran! Wait! These are good smells!*</p><p>Theran hunched his shoulders and walked faster. When he was ten years old, he\u2019d spent a week sulking and pining because Talon wouldn\u2019t let him have a dog. Why in the name of Hell had he ever wanted one of the damn things?</p><p>*Theran!*</p><p>And how was he supposed to shake free of this one? Maybe, once he was in the village, she\u2019d get distracted by another of those damn smells and he could slip away, and she\u2019d lose the trail, the scent, whatever. Maybe she\u2019d latch on to some other unsuspecting man.</p><p>Of course, there would be the little problem of going back to the Hall without her, but she\u2019d find her way home, wouldn\u2019t she? Eventually?</p><p>*Theran!*</p><p>When he got home, he was going to apologize to Talon for being such a whiny little prick about not having a pet. Sure, that was seventeen years ago and something Talon had shrugged off, but the man had raised him and now with the wisdom of maturity\u2014and less than an hour\u2019s worth of actual experience\u2014he knew Talon\u2019s decision had been the correct one.</p> <p>*Theran!*</p><p>He caught sight of the village of Halaway and forgot about the dog.</p><p>The road was the main street of a small, prosperous-looking village. Confident that he would go undetected at the depth of his Green Jewel, he sent out psychic tendrils to get a feel for the place. For a moment, he thought he detected a ripple of power under the strength of the Green, but it was gone before he could be certain.</p><p>The village smelled clean. There was no underlying psychic odor of fear that was typical in Dena Nehele\u2019s villages. These people were practically on the doorstep of SaDiablo Hall, but they weren\u2019t afraid of the power that lived there.</p><p>He wanted this for his own people, he thought as he strolled down the sidewalk, glancing into shop windows. He wanted this for the town of Grayhaven. He watched how the people moved, noticed the lack of wariness and tension when men and women passed one another on the sidewalks.</p><p>Then a door opened a couple of shops up. The woman who was leaving said,\u201cYes, I\u2019ll watch for that\u201d to someone in the shop and didn\u2019t notice him until she stepped right in front of him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t particularly like the gold eyes that were typical of the long-lived races, but she would have been an attractive woman if she hadn\u2019t cropped her black hair so damn short. What was it about the women here that they tried to look unappealing? Sure, men served and women ruled the bed, but at least back home the women knew that arousing a man was the first step to their own pleasure.</p><p>\u201cPrince,\u201d she said, sounding cautious\u2014as she should when addressing a male of his caste, especially one who wore a dark Jewel.</p><p>He frowned at her, not bothering to hide his disapproval of her appearance.</p><p>Then he caught a whiff of her psychic scent and thought, Oh, shit, just before he was surrounded by hard-eyed, grim-faced men who seemed to come out of nowhere\u2014including a Red-Jeweled Warlord who was holding a sledgehammer and was big enough to be a wall without any help.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d the Queen said, tapping the Red-Jeweled wall on the shoulder.</p><p>No clean psychic scent in the village now. These men were pissed off, insulted that he\u2019d frowned at their Queen.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t yield, didn\u2019t obey\u2014and Theran recognized a fight he couldn\u2019t win.</p><p>Then . . .</p><p>*Theran!* Annoyance rang through a broad psychic thread, followed by a muttered, *Stubborn sheep.*</p><p>A vein of amusement suddenly flowed through the anger surrounding him. The circle shifted\u2014and he didn\u2019t need to see the Queen peer around the large Warlord and smile to know that the dog was standing next to him.</p><p>\u201cLady Vae,\u201d the Queen said.</p><p>*Lady Sylvia,* Vae replied. *He is Theran. He is staying with Daemon and Jaenelle. I am taking him for walkies so he can see the village. We will get some food and he will sit and watch humans so he will learn how to behave.*</p><p>Sylvia\u2019s gold eyes sparkled. \u201cAre you a stubborn sheep, Prince Theran?\u201d</p><p>Sensing the amount of temper still focused on him, he decided not to answer, since he didn\u2019t think he could keep his voice sufficiently civil.</p><p>*I am helping to train him,* Vae said. *I am allowed to bite. But not hard. Not the first time.*</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Sylvia ducked behind the Warlord. That didn\u2019t muffle the snorts and giggles.</p><p>He felt the anger break around him, and he had a feeling that whatever was coming was a harder punishment than a beating would have been.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Sylvia said, struggling to maintain some dignity as she stepped clear of the large Warlord. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t delay your training any longer. Prince Theran, just tell any of the dining houses to put your meal on the Hall\u2019s tab.\u201d</p><p>Did he look like he didn\u2019t have marks to spare?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s customary,\u201d Sylvia added, showing more understanding than he liked.</p><p>The men opened up a space for him but not in a way that would allow him to get within reach of Lady Sylvia.</p><p>Accepting the dismissal and wanting to get away from the village, he started to turn back toward the Hall, then swore loudly when he got nipped.</p><p>*This way, Theran. This way!*</p><p>Not daring to do anything else, he let himself be herded down the main street with the Sceltie trotting a step behind him, ready to nip at his heels.</p><p>Mother Night, it was humiliating\u2014and him a Warlord Prince!</p><p>*Sheep brains,* Vae said, finally trotting alongside him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>*You made those males angry. You act like you have sheep brains. Foolish.*</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything!\u201d He kept his voice low, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d swallow being scolded by a dog.</p><p>*You did. You made them angry. They do not fight for no reason.*</p><p>They didn\u2019t have a reason. Not really. Sure, he\u2019d expressed an opinion of sorts, and he wouldn\u2019t have if he\u2019d caught Sylvia\u2019s psychic scent first. But, Hell\u2019s fire, she didn\u2019t look like a Queen with that hair and the shirt and trousers and . . .</p><p>He was making excuses for himself. He hadn\u2019t been careful, and if Vae hadn\u2019t amused them all, he wouldn\u2019t be strolling through the village. He\u2019d be wounded\u2014or dead.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t survived in Dena Nehele by being careless. He couldn\u2019t afford to set aside all the things Talon had taught him just because he didn\u2019t have a clear sense of the battlefield. And he couldn\u2019t afford to forget that the power that had devastated Terreille had come from Kaeleer.</p><p>So he walked and he watched. Children tensed at the sight of a stranger, then relaxed again when they saw Vae. Clearly the dog was a signal he didn\u2019t understand. He didn\u2019t approach, didn\u2019t talk to them, but he saw a pattern when he passed a group of children\u2014the boys stepped forward, creating a shield between him and the girls.</p><p>\u201cThe men who were angry,\u201d Theran said. \u201cWere they all members of the Queen\u2019s court?\u201d</p><p>*They live in the village,* Vae replied. *They serve.*</p><p>\u201cBut were they court?\u201d</p><p>No, I do not think any of them were court.*</p><p>\u201cThen why did they do that?\u201d</p><p>Vae stopped walking and looked at him. *It is their right to defend.* She turned her head and sniffed the air. *There is food.*</p><p>I guess one of us wants to eat.</p><p>Whatever the usual rule about animals being inside a dining house, the young witch who greeted them took one look at Vae, tipped her head as if in private conversation, then settled them at a table next to the windows.</p><p>He had a bowl of soup. Vae had a small plate of raw stew meat.</p><p>He ate slowly, watching, thinking.</p><p>The males considered it their right to defend, not their duty. So different from what he came from, what he knew.</p><p>Could his people do it? Could the males who would have to form the First Circle be able to make the transition from duty to desire?</p><p>He had no answers, so he watched and he thought\u2014and he wondered.</p><p>Daemon buttoned the last button of his white silk shirt as Saetan walked into the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter. Embarrassed.\u201d Daemon tucked the shirt into his trousers and gave more thought to the question. \u201cHungry.\u201d He\u2019d slept for a few hours and didn\u2019t feel as shaky as he\u2019d felt early that morning. But he still had to face that room, and that was better done on an empty stomach. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll join you before I retire for the afternoon.\u201d Saetan opened the door.</p><p>Slipping into his black jacket, Daemon stepped into the corridor and stared at the door to the Consort\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>Saetan crossed the corridor, opened the door, and stepped into the room. Daemon hesitated, almost hoping for a command to stay out. When it didn\u2019t come, he followed his father into the room and looked toward the left wall that held the doors leading to the bathroom and closet.</p> <p>It smelled clean, like it did when Helene gave the room its seasonal scrubbing. Almost too clean, he thought as he noticed the lack of psychic scent. A hint of his presence was still there under the scents of soap and polish, but less than usual. Less than a cleaning would account for.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Saetan asked quietly.</p><p>Better this way. That lack of presence was better.</p><p>The room was safe again. Chaste again. And he wouldn\u2019t . . .</p><p>He looked at the bed.</p> <p>Mine!</p><p>\u201cDaemon, back away from whatever you\u2019re thinking. Daemon.\u201d</p><p>The whiplash command and the power behind it was barely enough, but he leashed the desire\u2014and felt disgust rising in its place.</p><p>He forced himself to say the words, to admit what he wanted to deny with all his heart. \u201cThe Sadist was in that bed with her last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was,\u201d Saetan said quietly. \u201cAnd I imagine he enjoyed being there.\u201d</p><p>He studied his father, not sure how to interpret the words.</p> <p>Saetan sighed and rubbed two fingers across his forehead as if trying to ease an ache. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that this happened last night when you were churned up with memories of Terreille, but, Daemon, it would have happened. Because of who you are. Because of who Jaenelle is. This would have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019ve twisted a part of yourself into a powerful weapon, honed it to the point people have given it a different name. You\u2019ve given it a different name. But it\u2019s part of your nature, Daemon. It\u2019s part of your caste. It\u2019s in every one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no name for it. It\u2019s not like the rut, which is a kind of physical insanity that can be recognized by anyone who knows what to look for. This is emotional\u2014and it\u2019s darker, more dangerous when it happens. It\u2019s the thrill of being feared while you seduce your lover to the point where she doesn\u2019t want to refuse. And at the same time it\u2019s the comfort of being able to reveal that side of your nature to a lover and know you\u2019re still trusted.\u201d Saetan lowered his hand and stared at the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s a potential for violence that is transformed into a kind of ruthless gentleness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is part of our caste, why isn\u2019t it recognized like the rut?\u201d Daemon asked. And why have I never heard about it?</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s something that shifts inside you for an hour, for a night\u2014or sometimes for only as long as it takes you to feel that moment of possession, that moment when you look at a woman and think, Mine, and know it\u2019s true.</p><p>\u201cThe potential to possess. The desire to possess. Warlord Princes are dominating, territorial, and possessive. Most of the time those traits are seen in relation to other males, to possible rivals.\u201d Saetan looked him in the eyes. \u201cBut sometimes\u2014especially for a Warlord Prince who is so strong, who stands so deep in the abyss\u2014you look at the woman who pulls at you and the need to possess is overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>Saetan rubbed his hands together, then looked at the Black-Jeweled ring on his right hand. \u201cWe\u2019re guests most of the time and on our best behavior because of that. We come to our lover\u2019s bed, and even if we share that bed ninety-nine nights out of a hundred, it\u2019s still her bed. Our beds are for sleep, for rest, for solitude. But the rare times when we take a woman into our bed, it\u2019s different. It feels different. No matter how gentle you are, how careful, it isn\u2019t lovemaking. It\u2019s not even sex. It\u2019s possession. Her body belongs to you for that night, and you play with it. You bring her to a climax\u2014or you deny her that completion. For a little while.\u201d</p><p>He was hearing a description of the Sadist in his mildest form. He was hearing a description of what he\u2019d done last night. And he was hearing something else.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve felt that way,\u201d he said, looking at his father and seeing a man capable of playing those kinds of games. Seeing a man who had played those games. But not out of cruelty or rage. Saetan had played those games out of desire.</p><p>\u201cI never looked at Hekatah and thought, Mine, which should have told me the truth about her feelings and my own.\u201d</p><p>Daemon hesitated, but curiosity pushed aside caution. \u201cSylvia?\u201d</p><p>Saetan closed his eyes. \u201cYes, Sylvia. There were a few times while we were lovers when she came to my bed and . . .\u201d He swallowed hard.</p><p>A feeling in the room. They both had to step away from it, shake it off. For now. But he would have to circle around the subject with Jaenelle and find out if she\u2019d found the Sadist thrilling or frightening. If she\u2019d found him thrilling . . .</p><p>Step back, fool, before you become a danger to everyone around you.</p><p>Since he could see Saetan trying to shake off the feeling as well, he cast around for something else to talk about.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Theran?\u201d</p><p>A flash of amusement from Saetan. \u201cI sent him down to the village. With Vae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVae?\u201d Daemon stared at his father. \u201cYou sent him to Halaway with Vae?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young Sceltie who\u2019s such a managing little bitch that Khary used up every favor owed him in order to get her out of his own village for a month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sent her with a man who doesn\u2019t know anything about Scelties or kindred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>Daemon swallowed the sudden tickle in his throat. \u201cThat was mean.\u201d</p><p>Saetan smiled. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>As he thought about Theran trying to cope with any Sceltie, let alone Vae, Daemon staggered back a couple of steps, hit the wall\u2014and filled the room with laughter.</p><p>By the time dinner was half-over, Theran missed being around Vae. At least with the nippy little bitch, he had a clear idea of where he stood. Sitting across from Jaenelle Angelline, with her husband and her father the only other people sitting at the table, he felt like he was walking on a knife\u2019s edge. Say too much or sound too flattering and he would be stepping on Sadi\u2019s territorial toes. Say too little and he would be condemned by the father for his lack of courtesy.</p><p>Either way, it wasn\u2019t making dinner sit easy. And Lady Angelline\u2019s refusal to say anything about her meeting wasn\u2019t helping his digestion. Neither was the way she looked at him, as if she knew something about him that amused her.</p><p>When the fruit and cheese arrived at the end of the meal, along with squares of thick chocolate and coffee, Saetan said, \u201cAll right, witch-child. Share the joke. What is it about Prince Theran that you find so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Theran has some traditional tastes,\u201d Jaenelle said with a sweetness that made Theran\u2019s palms sweat. \u201cApparently he has the same resistance toward women wearing short hair and trousers that you do.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.</p><p>Saetan gave Jaenelle a pointed look. \u201cI don\u2019t recall making any comment about your hair.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle pursed her lips. \u201cThat\u2019s true. You\u2019ve never been that rigid in your preferences.\u201d</p><p>Two pairs of gold eyes fixed on Theran, and he was really hoping there was a house rule that guests were not executed at the dinner table.</p><p>\u201cBut like you,\u201d Jaenelle continued, \u201cTheran will have to develop some flexibility and learn how to compromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what I did?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Papa, that\u2019s what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delighted to hear it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and Theran watched in a kind of wonder as the sound completely relaxed two violent and powerful men.</p><p>Then those sapphire eyes looked into his. \u201cThere is a Queen who may be willing to come to Dena Nehele and show your people how a Territory is ruled when the Old Ways are followed. If she decides to accept the offer, she will be at the Keep seven days from now. The terms Prince Sadi has set for her being in Terreille are acceptable to her. You need to talk to your people to see if the terms are acceptable to them. If they are, you\u2019ll meet us at the Keep, and she will return with you to Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s heart sank. \u201cThere\u2019s only one who might be willing? We\u2019re talking about a whole Territory, not some village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are others, and you\u2019re free to seek them if you choose. But you came here and asked for our help. This is our answer.\u201d</p><p>Your answer, Theran thought, knowing it was the only answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to get back to Dena Nehele as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be much to discuss before we make a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Coach can take you back to the Keep this evening,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Theran nodded and said nothing more as the last course of the meal dragged on. As soon as he could, he left the table, offering the feeble excuse of needing to pack.</p><p>One choice. One chance. Would this Queen have enough dazzle to convince bitter men to serve?</p><p>One way or another, he\u2019d have his answer in seven days.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I want to check the rest of the messages Beale has waiting for me,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cI never got past Sylvia\u2019s note when I returned from Dharo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because you were laughing so hard,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said, brushing a hand over his shoulder. \u201cNo, don\u2019t get up. You two enjoy your wine.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she walked out of the room, Daemon dismissed the footman who had served them at dinner.</p><p>For a few minutes, the two men simply drank wine\u2014he finishing up the bottle of red, while Saetan drank yarbarah, the blood wine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me Sylvia cut her hair,\u201d Saetan said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you wanted to know about her personal life,\u201d Daemon replied.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. Can\u2019t. But . . . Is it that unattractive?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. It\u2019s sassy. It suits her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Grayhaven\u2019s an ass.\u201d</p><p>Daemon shrugged. \u201cWhat he wants for his people shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. And it took balls to come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it did.\u201d Saetan swirled the yarbarah in the ravenglass goblet. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t fit. His Jewels are dark enough and his personality is strong enough, but he doesn\u2019t fit in with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looks into Jaenelle\u2019s eyes and doesn\u2019t see who she is,\u201d Daemon said.</p> <p>Saetan nodded. \u201cYes. That was always the test when it came to accepting someone into the Dark Court, even for an apprenticeship. If the person couldn\u2019t look into her eyes and know, he would rub the entire First Circle the wrong way and their tempers would start sharpening for an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately, Theran won\u2019t have to deal often with anyone who served in the Dark Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept his new Queen,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Daemon blew out a breath. \u201cExcept the new Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Jaenelle. Will you be all right this evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you be all right?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYes, Father, I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll return to the Keep and see Theran back to Terreille.\u201d</p><p>They found Jaenelle\u2014and Vae\u2014waiting for them in the great hall. Theran joined them a minute later.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your help and your hospitality,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>The words were properly spoken, but Daemon had the impression that Theran would have said anything if it got him out of the Hall.</p><p>\u201cWitch-child,\u201d Saetan said, kissing Jaenelle\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Daemon felt more than saw a flash of understanding between them before Saetan shifted to him and put a hand against his face.</p> <p>A different kind of understanding, an acknowledgment that the darkest feelings that lived inside him were not unique. He\u2019d done something with those feelings no other male had done, but he knew now that he could temper those feelings when he chose to, could soften them to be an enticement rather than a weapon.</p><p>*Massage, not sex tonight,* Saetan said.</p><p>Right.</p><p>A pat on the shoulder and his father walked out the door with Grayhaven.</p><p>*Bye, Theran!* Vae said, bouncing in some kind of tail-wagging happy dance. *Bye!*</p><p>As soon as Beale closed the door,Vae looked at both of them. *He is male and foolish. He needs me. When he comes for the Queen, I will go live with him.*</p><p>She trotted out of the great hall, leaving him and Jaenelle staring at the door.</p><p>\u201cWe could make it part of the bargain,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cIf he wants the Queen, he has to take the Sceltie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Hell\u2019s fire.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t occur to him until much later, when he was cuddled up with Jaenelle in her bed, that Beale hadn\u2019t thought there was anything odd about the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan and the former Queen of Ebon Askavi sitting on the floor of the great hall laughing like fools.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Theran stared at the ninety-nine Warlord Princes and wished one of them would sneeze, cough, fart\u2014anything to break the stone-hard silence.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne choice,\u201d Ranon, the Shalador Warlord Prince, said. \u201cAnd if she turns out to be a bad choice, she\u2019ll destroy what\u2019s left of us.\u201d</p><p>I know. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Daemon Sadi would recommend a Queen who would be a danger to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadi hated Terreille,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cHe might see this as an opportunity to crush a Territory completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadi hated everything to do with Dorothea SaDiablo and what she was doing to the Realm,\u201d Theran said, raising his voice to be heard above the mutters.</p><p>\u201cThat may be true,\u201dArcherr said. \u201cBut you said it was his wife who went and talked to this Queen.\u201d</p><p>*And you\u2019ve said damn little about the wife,* Talon said on a psychic thread aimed directly at him.</p><p>*Nothing much to say,* Theran replied.</p><p>Talon shifted in his chair. The mutters faded as the other Warlord Princes focused their attention on him.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Talon said. \u201cJared trusted Daemon Sadi. So did Blaed. They knew him. He gave them some training when they were slaves, and helped them survive. Yeah, that was a few centuries ago, and maybe he\u2019s changed\u2014maybe he jumps now when his wife snaps her fingers. But the terms he set tell me he gave some thought to this request. They won\u2019t be all that easy for us to meet, and these \u2018inspections\u2019 don\u2019t sit well with me, I can tell you that. Even so, I think we have to take this chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me, Prince Talon,\u201d Ranon said, his tone respectful, \u201cbut you\u2019re demon-dead. You have less to lose than the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have less to lose physically,\u201d Talon agreed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have anything to lose. But I\u2019ll offer to serve in this Queen\u2019s court\u2014and that\u2019s an offer I didn\u2019t make to Grizelle or Lia when they ruled. I served them both in my own way, but I never chained myself to a contract.\u201d</p><p>Feet shuffled. Bodies shifted in chairs. They all understood how hard it would be for a man who had been rogue for so many years to hand over his life to a Queen.</p><p>\u201cHow do we decide who serves in the First Circle?\u201d Ranon finally asked. \u201cAny of us who leaves our piece of Dena Nehele for a year will leave those Blood open to landen attacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should all offer,\u201d Theran said. He\u2019d thought about this on the way back to Grayhaven. \u201cLet her choose whatever twelve of us appeal to her. I\u2019m required to offer myself as one of the Queen\u2019s triangle. The rest of you can offer yourselves according to your skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rest of the Blood?\u201d Archerr asked. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need other females in the court.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re going to need a lot more than that, Theran thought. \u201cA court is made by twelve males and a Queen. Everything else builds from that. Let\u2019s establish the First Circle and give the Queen a couple of days to settle in and get to know those males. Then we\u2019ll set up some audiences to let anyone else present themselves to her.\u201d</p><p>Ranon stood up. \u201cIn that case, I\u2019m heading back to the Shalador reserves to inform the elders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRanon . . . ,\u201d Theran began.</p><p>Ranon smiled bitterly. \u201cI know we\u2019ve never been welcome in a court, but we\u2019ll be ruled by this Queen too, Theran, so it\u2019s only polite to offer our Blood for the Lady\u2019s pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Ranon walked out. A few seconds later, the other Warlord Princes followed, leaving Talon and Theran alone.</p><p>Theran straddled a chair and braced his arms on the back. \u201cMaybe it was a mistake to invite Ranon to be part of this. He\u2019s too bitter, too angry, although he hides that fairly well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you that if you weren\u2019t who you are, you\u2019d be living in the reserves with him,\u201d Talon said. \u201cHalf your bloodline came from the Shalador people. You\u2019ve got the green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of people in Dena Nehele have green eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that shade. You only find that shade of green in the reserves, and it\u2019s rare even there. You have Shalador eyes,Theran. Jared\u2019s eyes. He came from that race, and Dorothea SaDiablo went beyond the initial fighting there and destroyed that Territory and that race because Jared helped Lia. The Shalador people have had a harder time surviving than the rest of us, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>He did know it. That didn\u2019t erase his worry that the Blood living in the reserves would try to splinter Dena Nehele even more.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be going back to the rogue camps in the mountains,\u201d Theran said. \u201cI\u2019ll be living here, at Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re accepted in the court, you\u2019ll be here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s not likely she\u2019ll accept someone who\u2019s demon-dead, but if she does, I won\u2019t be going back to the mountains either.\u201d Talon sighed. \u201cYou have to tell Gray. You have to let him make his own choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat choice? He can\u2019t survive on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of rogues who will stay up in the mountains, not feeling easy enough to come down. They\u2019ll look after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same as family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Talon said gently. \u201cBut he may not be able to do this. Most likely, he can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Theran stood up abruptly, no longer able to stay still. \u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201d</p><p>They were both twenty-seven years old. They both had dark hair and green eyes, although the shade of green came from different bloodlines, and one of them had fairer skin than the other. They were similar enough in body and face that they could easily be mistaken for each other at first glance.</p><p>But one of them had become a man only in terms of physical maturity and had retreated, mentally and emotionally, to being a docile boy, despite also being a Warlord Prince who wore Purple Dusk Jewels.</p><p>Jared Blaed Grayhaven. The young Warlord Prince who was supposed to be Theran\u2019s blade and shield in the same way that Blaed had backed Jared.</p><p>They were cousins through their mothers. Gray, as they called him, had no link to the Grayhaven bloodline, despite being given that family name, but he could trace his line back to Blaed and Thera, the Black Widow who had been Lia\u2019s closest friend.</p><p>Had their names been a deliberate attempt at deception or a way to honor the past? Theran had wondered about that a lot after what happened twelve years ago.</p><p>Theran\u2019s shield. Gray had been that. They had been making a rare visit to a village near the mountains and had separated to take care of their own business before returning to the camp they were currently calling home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Province Queen\u2019s guards, making a surprise inspection of the village, had spotted Gray and taken him to the Territory Queen, who had kept him to \u201cserve\u201d in her court. The guards had grabbed him and run, not wanting to tangle with the rogues who frequented the village when they had captured such a prize\u2014and not realizing there had been a second boy.</p><p>They\u2019d thought they had captured the Grayhaven bloodline, and Gray never told them anything different, never revealed that he wasn\u2019t the descendant of the Shalador Warlord who had been Lia\u2019s husband.</p><p>They worked him\u2014and they tortured him\u2014for two years before Talon was able to rescue him and get him back to the mountains.</p> <p>Gray was fifteen when he was taken.</p><p>They didn\u2019t break his Jewels or castrate him\u2014two common methods of diminishing a male who might be a threat. But they broke him in other ways, and now, as he sat across from Theran, his green eyes so full of fear, Theran wondered if taking Gray back to Grayhaven would be the ultimate act of betrayal.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cYou\u2019re not hurt?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter if Theran was returning from a fight or slipping into a village to spend a couple of needed hours with a woman; the questions were always the same because, for Gray, the last time he\u2019d left the mountains, he\u2019d lost everything he was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Gray. I\u2019m fine,\u201d Theran said, leaning over to give his cousin\u2019s hand a friendly squeeze.</p> <p>\u201cBut something bad has happened.\u201d</p><p>Too perceptive.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, no.\u201d How to say this to cause the least harm? \u201cWe\u2019re getting a Queen, Gray. Do you remember me talking with Talon about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Queen?\u201d All the color drained out of Gray\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cFrom Kaeleer, the Shadow Realm. She\u2019s going to rule Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to the mountains, no. She\u2019s going to be living at Grayhaven.\u201d Theran took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to be living there with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t!\u201d Gray leaped up, giving Talon a desperate look. \u201cHe can\u2019t! If she\u2019s at Grayhaven and knows who . . . who he . . .\u201d</p><p>The keening started as Gray sank to his knees. That horrible keening of a boy in terrible pain.</p><p>\u201cGray.\u201d Dropping to his knees, Theran wrapped his arms around his cousin. \u201cGray, I have to do this. For all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll hurt you, she\u2019ll hurt you. I\u2019m Grayhaven. I\u2019m Grayhaven!\u201d</p><p>The last words were said in a rising scream that echoed the pain remembered.</p><p>Theran looked at Talon, whose face was grim and sad. The old Warlord Prince had searched, and searched hard, to find the boy. But Talon didn\u2019t find Gray soon enough.</p><p>Talon went down on one knee and put a hand on Gray\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go down there. You can stay up here in the mountains. You know how to fend for yourself. I taught you that. And there will be others staying up here. You don\u2019t have to go back to Grayhaven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t go,\u201d Gray whispered as he sagged against Theran. \u201cTheran can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the bargain.\u201d</p><p>Gray pulled away from both of them and walked over to a window.</p><p>What was he seeing? Theran wondered. The past? The present? Was he here with them in this cabin in the mountains or locked in some room in Grayhaven, waiting for the next bit of cruelty?</p><p>\u201cI like growing things,\u201d Gray said quietly, more to himself than to them. \u201cThe land was good, parched of what it needed, but still good. I could work outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to live inside, would I?\u201d</p><p>Shock kept Theran silent for a moment. He hadn\u2019t expected Gray to consider leaving the mountains. Not really.</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t have to live inside,\u201d Theran said. \u201cThere\u2019s an old stone gardening shed.\u201d He looked at Talon.</p><p>\u201cProbably filled with broken tools and such,\u201d Talon said,\u201cbut someone could live rough out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be a gardener,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI could take care of the land. But I couldn\u2019t serve her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t have to serve her,\u201d Theran said. But if the new Queen showed any inclination toward playing with a damaged male, he\u2019d have to explain a few things to the Lady.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201d Gray turned and looked at him\u2014and Theran had never seen anything as bleak as the look in his cousin\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m Theran\u2019s blade.\u201d</p><p>Oh, Gray.</p><p>Talon cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s settled, then. Tomorrow we\u2019ll pack up and start getting Grayhaven ready for the new Queen.\u201d</p><p>Gray bolted out of the cabin.</p><p>Theran got to his feet, feeling more exhausted than if he\u2019d been in a fight.</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll survive going back there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,Theran,\u201d Talon replied. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Cassidy packed the last book and closed the lid of the small trunk. Just some favorites, things she read when she wanted the comfort of a familiar story.</p><p>She was as ready as she could be. Which wasn\u2019t saying much, since there was precious little information about Dena Nehele. What she did know was that Dharo was on the eastern side of a mountain range and Dena Nehele was on the western side of a mountain range. Dena Nehele had a variety of seasons, so she\u2019d packed all her clothes, figuring most would be useful.</p><p>As for the rest . . .</p><p>\u201cSecond thoughts?\u201d</p><p>Twisting around, Cassidy looked at her mother, who was standing in the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m on my fourth or fifth set of thoughts about doing this, but I haven\u2019t changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t think you would.\u201d Devra came into the bedroom and sat on the floor beside her daughter. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for you. I know it\u2019s a bit more to carry, but you won\u2019t be straining to carry all of it yourself, so . . .\u201d She called in an open-topped wooden box filled with glass jars. \u201cA bit of home to take with you.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy lifted one jar and read the neat label. Then picked up another. \u201cMother, these are your seeds for the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI divided what I had between us,\u201d Devra said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to be careful. Some of these might not be healthy to give to a different land. But most, I think, will be similar enough to what is there. So you can turn over a small patch of ground, plant a few seeds\u2014and know we\u2019re with you in heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother.\u201d Cassidy blinked back tears as she ran her fingers over the tops of the jars. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Devra brushed a hand lightly over Cassidy\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re still set on going after the midday meal?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like some time to settle before I meet the Warlord Prince from Dena Nehele. Prince Sadi and Lady Angelline arranged for us all to have dinner at the Keep so there would be an opportunity to talk with him a bit before making a final decision.\u201d A formality, really. Unless he was some kind of fearsome male, she would give his people a year of her life. Besides, she\u2019d spent four months in the Dark Court and had slammed into Lucivar Yaslana on occasion, and there was no male more fearsome than Yaslana when he was in a mood.</p><p>Except Prince Sadi. Or so she\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cIs Poppi coming home to see me off?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cYour father is in the sitting room, brooding. Has been for the past hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to leave his work so early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hit his thumb with a hammer twice because he was busy brooding.\u201d Devra shook her head. \u201cAfter that, old Lord Wittier tottered your father over to the Healer\u2019s to make sure nothing was broken, and refused to let him come back to finish the work until you were off.\u201d</p><p>She could picture old Lord Wittier clinging to Burle\u2019s arm to keep his balance while insisting that he was taking Burle to the Healer\u2014and telling everyone why Burle needed a Healer.</p><p>Smacked himself with a hammer, the fool. Too busy thinking about his girl to tell the difference between a nail and a thumbnail. Gotta take him to the Healer\u2019s, make sure he didn\u2019t mash any bones. Who would have thought Burle would smack himself with a hammer?</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said, wishing she\u2019d been in a shop where she could have watched that procession without being seen.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tease your father, Cassidy. He\u2019s already had a difficult day.\u201d</p><p>Taking the wooden box from her mother, Cassidy set it next to the trunk of books. \u201cShall we go downstairs? There\u2019s nothing more to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you go down now, he\u2019ll have an extra hour to fuss about you leaving and to take you through the checklist he made in order to check the checklist he\u2019d previously made.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy smiled. \u201cI know. But he\u2019ll feel better for it, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>Despite the unmistakable psychic scent that identified his caste, the thing that had always amazed Cassidy was how a man as powerful as the High Lord of Hell could feel like a Steward\u2014like a man who didn\u2019t find the tedium of paperwork tedious, like a benign clerk who simply wanted to be helpful. Like a strict and yet indulgent honorary uncle to the most powerful Queens and Warlord Princes in Kaeleer.</p><p>Kind. Courteous. Indulgent.</p><p>Unless you made him angry. Then there would be the lightning-fast change from benign clerk into predator. She\u2019d never been the cause of that change in the few months she\u2019d served in the Dark Court, but she\u2019d seen it, felt the cold punch of temper that had flashed through the Hall, warning everyone that the High Lord was not pleased.</p><p>Right now she wasn\u2019t sure if his mood was benign clerk or honorary uncle, but after the past few days with her father, Cassidy recognized the look of a man who had his own checklist and wasn\u2019t about to let her walk away until they\u2019d gone over every single item. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour trunks are all packed?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, and they\u2019ve already been taken to the Keep in Terreille and stored in the Coach,\u201d Cassidy replied.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brought some personal things with you? Books? Music?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re also in the Coach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinter clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cassidy huffed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve brought a stack of clean handkerchiefs.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, one eyebrow rising as his mouth curved in that dry, knowing smile.</p><p>She winced. I don\u2019t believe I said that to the High Lord.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Saetan said, \u201cwas that on your mother\u2019s list or your father\u2019s list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which one tucked a few marks about two-thirds of the way down in the stack so you would find the gift about the time you might be feeling homesick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one . . .\u201d She remembered her father blushing and mumbling something when she\u2019d walked into her room and found him poking around near her trunks. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>Saetan\u2019s smile warmed. \u201cI\u2019m a father.\u201d He leaned against a big stuffed chair and crossed his arms. \u201cDo you want some advice?\u201d</p><p>Since that wasn\u2019t actually a question, she nodded obediently.</p> <p>\u201cAccording to the conditions Prince Sadi set to have you go to Dena Nehele, you will send him a report once a week. That report is from the Queen of Dena Nehele to the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan and can be nothing more than information about your court and your official meetings for that week. That will tell him how the Queen is doing, but not how you are. He can accept that because you don\u2019t know him beyond a passing acquaintance. Therefore, you should also write a brief note to Jaenelle to let her know how you\u2019re doing. That\u2019s personal and equally important. Don\u2019t shrug it off. If you miss a report, there are Warlord Princes in Kaeleer who are already committed to finding out why, and they will descend on Dena Nehele ready to step onto a killing field. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Cassidy hesitated. \u201cDo you really think this will be that dangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I thought you\u2019d be in danger, you wouldn\u2019t be going,\u201d Saetan replied softly. Then he shifted a little and continued in his usual voice. \u201cYou should also send a note to your mother when you send the report. We\u2019ll see that it reaches her. That should be a daughter-to-mother note. Tell her about your life. Between those reports and notes, send a note to your father. He won\u2019t be concerned about the court; he wants to know about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I send them both at the same time?\u201d Cassidy asked. \u201cThen the messenger only has to make one trip to the Keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be good exercise for the messenger,\u201d Saetan said dryly. \u201cThe point is to reassure. Staggering the notes will make both your parents feel better since they\u2019ll hear from you twice as often. And at least once a month, write a letter to your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClayton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Clayton. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve never sent him a letter before. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s always gotten news about you from your parents. You won\u2019t be in Dharo anymore, Cassidy. Getting a letter from you that\u2019s just for him will matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should send a note to cousin Aaron too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot required, but definitely a good idea. This might help.\u201d Saetan called in a lap desk, which floated on air.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Cassidy pulled it closer. The sides and back were decorated with carved flowers. The hinged top was smooth and silky. When she opened the lid, she discovered two sizes of stationery, both decorated with a C that had been made into a formal crest.</p><p>\u201cThere are drawers on the sides,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>One drawer contained pens and ink. The other contained sticks of wax and three seals. One was a flower, one was the crest of her initial, and the other . . .</p><p>\u201cGeoffrey and I did a little digging in the library and found the Grayhaven crest that had been used during the time when the Gray Ladies ruled. We had the seal made for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not a Grayhaven,\u201d Cassidy protested.</p><p>\u201cI was told it would be appropriate for you to use that crest for your formal correspondence.\u201d</p><p>Who told you? She didn\u2019t have to ask. There was only one person Saetan would obey without question. She didn\u2019t know why Jaenelle thought it was appropriate for her to use that particular crest, but she wouldn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple more things.\u201d He pointed to four large crates. \u201cTwo of those contain primers in basic Protocol. The other two crates contain the more advanced study of Protocol.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t they be insulted if I bring those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be needed. Also, Prince Sadi has set aside some funds as a Queen\u2019s gift.\u201d He held up a hand, silencing her protest before it could form. \u201cThere are things that you will need that you may not be able to find in Terreille. Recognizing that you may hesitate to ask for those things from a people who will have little to spare, Daemon is willing to bear the cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Cassidy asked. \u201cIt would help to know so that I\u2019m not asking for anything unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he feels you\u2019re overspending, I\u2019m sure Daemon will let you know,\u201d Saetan replied mildly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have an easy task, Cassidy. You\u2019ll be the only one who knows the Old Ways and the Protocol that goes along with those ways. You\u2019ll be trying to help a people remember who they were. Accept the help we can give you.\u201d</p><p>She felt the blood draining out of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll be the only one who knows Protocol?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Saetan looked a little guilty. \u201cYou and Vae.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, puzzled. \u201cWho is Vae?\u201d</p><p>*Hi,Theran! Hi!*</p><p>Vae bounced in front of him, doing her happy dance.</p><p>*I have my special brushes, so you can brush me properly. And the clippers for my nails. Do you have Healers for kindred? In Scelt we have Healers for kindred. They heal other animals too, but they trained to take care of us. Maybe one of them will have to come and teach your Healer how to properly clip nails.*</p><p>He\u2019d fought. He\u2019d proved his worth as a leader. He wore a Green Jewel. He was the dominant living male in Dena Nehele.</p><p>And every time he was around these people, he seemed to stand there with his mouth hanging open while they ran right over him.</p><p>*I will tell Jaenelle you are here,Vae said. *She and the new Queen are doing fussing things. You cannot eat until they are done doing the fussing things.*</p><p>He waited until he was sure the Sceltie was out of the room and out of hearing. Then he turned to Daemon and said, \u201cNo. The dog is not coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is,\u201d Daemon said in a voice that was pleasant in a way that liquefied the bones in Theran\u2019s legs\u2014and not in a good way. \u201cShe knows Craft, which she will not hesitate to tell you, and she knows Protocol, which she will not hesitate to tell you. And she\u2019s decided to go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will it take to keep her here?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot more than you can afford. Accept it, Prince. You\u2019re taking the Sceltie. Or you\u2019re leaving without a Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s blackmail!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooooh, that\u2019s a harsh word.\u201d Daemon smiled. \u201cBut I won\u2019t quibble about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you want a report on her too,\u201d Theran said, not bothering to hide the bitterness he and the other Warlord Princes felt about these reports. They were too close a reminder of the \u201creports\u201d that had been sent to Dorothea SaDiablo\u2014and the people who had disappeared one night after those reports were sent.</p><p>\u201cNo, that isn\u2019t required,\u201d Daemon said, \u201cbut Vae has worked out how you\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to remember the basin of warm water so that you can clean the ink off her paw after she\u2019s told you what to write and puts her mark on the bottom of the page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter she\u2014\u201d He gave up trying to form words and just sputtered. He\u2019d avoided capture, avoided being leashed, avoided every damn snare that had been set for him, only to find himself chained to a dog.</p><p>\u201cWhich side of the triangle are you taking?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>As a change of topic, it wasn\u2019t any better. He felt some bitterness about that too. \u201cFirst Escort.\u201d No one else had been willing to do it. A few of the Warlord Princes had offered to fill the position of Master of the Guard, but they still hadn\u2019t found anyone willing to be the Steward either. He\u2019d considered it, but he would have hated being stuck behind a desk, and as Talon had pointed out, since he was being held personally responsible for this new Queen\u2019s well-being, First Escort was really the only choice.</p><p>Then Jaenelle Angelline walked into the room, followed by another woman, and Theran\u2019s first thought was, Thank the Darkness I don\u2019t have to bed her.</p><p>His second thought was he was mistaken\u2014this large-boned, gawky female with the awful red hair and spots on her face must be a companion or servant for Lady Angelline. If it weren\u2019t for the Rose Jewel she was wearing and the fact that she was here, he would have thought she was a hefty farm girl, all right for a bit of relief\u2014as long as the barn was dark enough\u2014but no one he would consider otherwise.</p><p>Mother Night!</p><p>Her psychic scent, masked by the power all around him since the High Lord walked into the room behind the women, hit him a moment later.</p><p>Queen.</p><p>No!</p><p>\u201cPrince Theran Grayhaven,\u201d Jaenelle said, \u201cthis is Lady Cassidy, the Queen who has consented to rule Dena Nehele. Cassidy, this is Theran Grayhaven\u201d\u2014she glanced at Daemon and her voice took on a strange, sharp edge\u2014\u201cwho has offered to stand as First Escort, if he is acceptable to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Grayhaven honors me.\u201d</p><p>She sounded sincere enough, but he couldn\u2019t read any emotion on that plain face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShall we go in to dinner?\u201d Saetan asked, stepping to one side.</p><p>Lady Cassidy hurried out of the room with Jaenelle right behind her. When the High Lord walked out of the room, the door began to close.</p><p>Theran took a step forward, then pulled up short when Sadi\u2019s hand wrapped around his arm, the long nails pricking him through shirt and jacket.</p> <p>\u201cFor a man who has lived in such a dangerous Territory, it\u2019s odd that you\u2019ve never learned to hide what you think,\u201d Daemon said too softly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything improper,\u201d Theran snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to. You\u2019ve made your opinion very clear, Grayhaven. So. Are you still going to join us for dinner, or should I make your excuses for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Theran pulled away, unnerved by the chilling contempt he saw in Daemon\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou rejected Lady Cassidy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did no such thing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, boyo. You didn\u2019t even try to hide your opinion when you saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what did you expect?\u201d Theran let some of his own anger show. \u201cDo you really think the other Warlord Princes will accept her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends,\u201d Daemon said with vicious control, \u201con whether they\u2019re looking for someone to rule their people according to the Old Ways or trying to picture her riding their cocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I bargained for!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is exactly what you bargained for,\u201d Daemon replied as he glided toward the door. Then he stopped and looked at Theran. \u201cBeing the last of Jared\u2019s bloodline got you this much and this far. But I\u2019ll tell you this now. If you had declared yourself Consort instead of First Escort, I\u2019d kill you where you stand to spare her enduring one minute with you in bed.\u201d</p> <p>Daemon didn\u2019t open the door. He used Craft to pass through the wood.</p><p>Theran stumbled over to a chair and sank into it.</p><p>No wonder this Queen had been available. No wonder she hadn\u2019t demanded more compensation for ruling a Territory. She was a Queen because she\u2019d been born into that caste, just as he had been born a Warlord Prince.</p><p>But no one wanted her. Who in the name of Hell would want her?</p><p>They\u2019d saddled him with a castoff, and he was stuck with her. Dena Nehele needed a Queen too desperately for him to go back home without her. So he would swallow his pride, go in to dinner, and bring Lady Cassidy to Dena Nehele to meet the rest of the Warlord Princes. And he would do the best he could for his people with what little she could offer.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>A few steps away from the dining room, Jaenelle had linked arms with Cassidy and pulled her into another room.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Cassidy had protested, \u201cdinner\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill wait.\u201d Jaenelle released her and stepped away. \u201cWhat do you think of Grayhaven?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy shrugged, not willing to voice her opinion.</p><p>Jaenelle pursed her lips. \u201cAs Lucivar would say, if you keep chewing on that gristle, sooner or later you\u2019re going to choke. So just spit it out.\u201d</p><p>Those last words were snapped out\u2014and Cassidy snapped back.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the look on his face when he realized I was the one who was supposed to go to Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain \u2018supposed to.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me in his precious Territory, doesn\u2019t want me ruling his people, and as sure as the sun doesn\u2019t shine in Hell, he doesn\u2019t want to serve me. So why am I doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no matter what he wants\u2014or thinks he wants\u2014his land and his people need you,\u201d Jaenelle replied.</p><p>A truth lodged in her heart and throat, choking her. She tried to swallow it, because it shamed her, but the words tumbled out. \u201cHe feels like my old First Circle.\u201d Like the men who had turned their backs on her for a younger Queen they found more exciting.</p><p>Jaenelle gave her a sharp look. \u201cYes,\u201d she said slowly,\u201che would feel like your First Circle, since he has something in common with them. He doesn\u2019t belong to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him as a pet,\u201d Cassidy snapped. Then added silently, Or anything else.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be obtuse.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy shivered at the hint of midnight in Jaenelle\u2019s voice and remembered to whom she spoke. \u201cMy apologies, Lady.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle walked over to the windows and stared outside for a minute before turning back to Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cA simple truth, Sister,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cTheran Grayhaven doesn\u2019t belong to you. He never will. He doesn\u2019t understand that yet, but you need to accept it. As First Escort, consider him your personal guard and your companion at official functions. In time you might be able to be friends, and even if you\u2019re not, you may be able to work well together for the common goal of restoring Dena Nehele. But he\u2019ll never be a member of your court in the truest sense. Don\u2019t expect him to be.\u201d</p><p>An awkward silence filled the room. Awkward for her, Cassidy admitted. Witch simply studied her\u2014and waited.</p><p>\u201cShall we join the men for dinner?\u201d Jaenelle finally asked. \u201cOr should I make your excuses and send Prince Theran back to Dena Nehele alone?\u201d</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Remembering the previous evening, Cassidy gingerly pulled aside the curtains, looked out a grimy window, and thought, It\u2019s only for a year.</p><p>And if the rest of the days were anything like the journey to Dena Nehele, it would be a long year.</p><p>Of course, she probably wasn\u2019t the only one counting the days until Theran could take her back to Ebon Askavi. Especially after her rejection of the Queen\u2019s suite.</p><p>It had been obvious that people had worked hard to clean up the suite, but she could barely stand being in the rooms. She couldn\u2019t consider living there. She didn\u2019t know what could have been done in a Queen\u2019s bedroom to make the room feel like that, but an oppressive, gleeful cruelty seemed to pulse from the walls.</p><p>She had bolted. She\u2019d stood in the hallway, trying not to be sick, trying to explain why she couldn\u2019t use the suite.</p><p>Theran had listened, tight-lipped and angry, as if her inability to use the suite that had been prepared for her was an insult to his people\u2014or confirmed his own opinion of her inadequacy to be the Territory Queen. Finally he\u2019d said,\u201cThe Lady must do as she pleases.\u201d</p><p>Close enough to Protocol. Avoiding the wing of the mansion that Theran had chosen as his family\u2019s residence, she quickly explored the rest of the available living quarters and found a suite of rooms that seemed to welcome her, even though the rooms were dusty and clearly hadn\u2019t been used in a long time.</p><p>The Blood who had been hired as servants scrambled to give the bedroom and bathroom enough of a cleaning so that she could move in. The mattress and bed linens in the other bedroom were new and hadn\u2019t absorbed the tainted psychic scent that filled the other suite. The look of relief on the servants\u2019 faces when she\u2019d agreed to use them had been painful to see\u2014and had told her more about the Queens who had ruled here than all the words Theran had grudgingly offered on the journey.</p><p>This morning he would introduce her to the other Warlord Princes. One hundred men, including Theran. All that was left of their caste after the Queens\u2019 purges had taken so many men who wouldn\u2019t bend to Dorothea\u2019s vision of the Blood. The landen uprisings that had started after Dorothea\u2019s taint had been cleansed from the Realms had taken even more. There must be boys in that caste who weren\u2019t included in that number, but she suspected they were hidden somewhere and were being trained in secret\u2014and were not something she could ask about until she had gained the adult males\u2019 trust.</p><p>One hundred Warlord Princes. How was she supposed to choose the twelve males required to make a First Circle?</p><p>Jaenelle, thank the Darkness, had offered an answer.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t choose the males who serve,\u201d Jaenelle had said. \u201cThey choose you. Cassie, the total failure of your First Circle was as much your fault as theirs. You accepted those men because they said they wanted to serve, but their reasons for wanting it had nothing to do with you. You chose with your head instead of letting your instincts as a Queen make the decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t chosen with my head, there would have been no court, and that village wouldn\u2019t have had a Queen.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s sapphire eyes stared at her, into her. \u201cThey would have survived without a Queen living within their village borders. That village became available because the old District Queen no longer wanted to rule more than her home village. The other three Blood villages under her rule could have gone to one Queen instead of being divided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that Queen wouldn\u2019t have been me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it wouldn\u2019t have been you. Dharo has a strong Territory Queen and strong Province Queens. The Blood there can be more indulgent in their choice of District Queens. They didn\u2019t need someone like you, Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle\u2019s words stung, more so because she\u2019d expected a little sympathy to balance out their before-dinner \u201cchat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey expect me to choose,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cHow do I choose if I\u2019m not supposed to choose?\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle smiled. While the now-apparent sympathy was the tonic Cassidy needed to soothe her bruised feelings, the equally apparent amusement made her nervous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cYou stand in front of them and let them all get a look at you. Say something so they can hear your voice. Then you wait. Many are going to feel disappointed\u2014and some will feel bitter about it because they don\u2019t realize it\u2019s part of forming a court. For most of them, you won\u2019t be the right Queen to serve\u2014at least not in the First Circle. They\u2019ll need to look at the other Queens. But the ones who belong to you . . . You may not recognize it immediately, since you\u2019ve never felt it, but they\u2019ll know. Some will approach you and look relaxed or relieved because they\u2019ve finally found something they\u2019ve needed. Others will be wary when they approach because they aren\u2019t sure if they can trust the instincts that are pushing them to hand over their lives and surrender to your rule. As each man approaches, look him in the eyes. If something inside you says, \u2018This one belongs to me,\u2019 then he does.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a First Circle filled with Warlord Princes,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your choice,\u201d Jaenelle replied. \u201cAnd, really, they\u2019re sweet men once you get past the bossiness and temper. I wouldn\u2019t expect more than half the First Circle to be filled with Warlord Princes, but they get to offer themselves before the other castes of males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarlords would be good,\u201d Cassidy muttered. Her four months in the Dark Court had shown her the advantages\u2014and disadvantages\u2014of having so many dominating males working together. Warlords didn\u2019t tend to argue as much about everything. Of course, the Warlord Princes in the Dark Court didn\u2019t exactly argue. They just set their heels down and didn\u2019t budge from their opinion.</p> <p>\u201cOh, one other thing about Warlord Princes,\u201d Jaenelle said just before they rejoined the men. \u201cThe ones that belong to you will want to sniff your neck. Don\u2019t make a fuss about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSniff my neck?\u201d Cassidy muttered, turning away from the window when someone knocked on the door. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>Birdie, the maid assigned to clean her suite, entered with a hesitant smile and a breakfast tray.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Lady Cassidy,\u201d Birdie said. \u201cThe Warlord Princes are gathering to meet you, so Maydra\u2014she\u2019s the cook\u2014thought you might like to have your breakfast in peace. And thought you might be feeling a bit nervous in the stomach.\u201d</p><p>An undercurrent of fear beneath the words.</p> <p>She\u2019d been tired last night, and distressed by Theran\u2019s attitude toward her as well as by some of the things Jaenelle had said, but now that she thought about it, that same undercurrent had been in Dryden, the butler, and Elle, the housekeeper, as well. They had been hired because they had experience working around a Queen\u2019s court, but they, and the other servants, were all afraid.</p><p>What had those other Queens done to these people?</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Cassidy. Those Queens were killed by the storm Witch had unleashed. That should tell you something.</p><p>\u201cPut the tray over there,\u201d Cassidy said. Following Birdie to the little table, she lifted the cover off the dish. Scrambled eggs and buttered toast. A little serving dish of fruit jam. A small pot of coffee, with cream and sugar on the side.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThat looks lovely. And please thank Maydra as well. This is exactly the kind of breakfast I need this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be relieved to hear it,\u201d Birdie said. \u201cElle says we\u2019ll be turning out your rooms for a proper cleaning while you\u2019re selecting the men for your court.\u201d</p> <p>If Jaenelle was right about how a court usually formed around a Queen, the selecting might not take as much time as everyone thought. Well, there would be plenty of other things to do that would keep her out of the servants\u2019 way for a few hours.</p><p>Suspecting this would be the last bit of solitude she would have for most of the day, Cassidy sat down to eat a quiet breakfast.</p><p>Then a thought made her snort. She clamped a hand over her mouth to keep from spraying toast crumbs all over the table.</p><p>Theran Grayhaven would never be hers, but she wasn\u2019t the one who would spend the next year on the receiving end of Vae\u2019s attention.</p><p>*Theran? Theran! Those males are not herding properly. They are supposed to stay in this room to see the Queen. I will fetch them.*</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>Why bother? Theran thought as Vae jumped off the platform that had been constructed for Lady Cassidy\u2019s audiences. The little bitch didn\u2019t listen to anything he said anyway, although she had plenty to say to him.</p><p>Of course, since the other men weren\u2019t being held responsible for the dog\u2019s welfare, they had no reason to pay attention to her.</p> <p>But they were paying attention. Hard not to when a dog was standing on air so that she could bark in a man\u2019s face. And she wasn\u2019t floating at a height where she could nip at their heels, but was in a position to nip someone\u2019s ass.</p><p>Vae charged around the room, nipping and barking and issuing orders.</p><p>*Come back here! It is time to meet the Queen! You there! Stop! Stubborn sheep.*</p><p>The men in the room moved closer to the platform. The ones who had been wandering returned, curious about what was causing so much commotion. Some of the men looked amused; some looked a little pissed off and were, no doubt, wondering what kind of trick he might be playing.</p><p>No question Ranon was more pissed off than amused. The Shalador Warlord Prince worked his way closer to the platform, gave the dog, who was now floating in front of him, a pointed look, then said, \u201cGrayhaven, what is this?\u201d</p><p>I am Vae. I am a Sceltie. I am kindred. I am a witch. I know my Craft. You are male and foolish. And human.*</p><p>Ranon blinked. \u201cA witch? She\u2019s a witch? That\u2019s really a Purple Dusk Jewel?\u201d</p><p>*Yes,* Vae replied before Theran could respond. *It is my Birthright Jewel. When I am older, I will make the Offering to the Darkness and get my other Jewel. I am going to help the Queen train her males. Especially Theran. It is time.*</p><p>Vae spun around and whapped Ranon in the face with her tail. *Theran? Theran! Go fetch the Queen.*</p><p>\u201cYeah, Theran,\u201d Ranon said, stepping back to avoid being whapped in the face again. \u201cGo fetch.\u201d</p><p>Could be worse, Theran thought as he strode toward the previously unused wing of the mansion. At least Cassidy wasn\u2019t a yapper as far as he could tell. And by the time he escorted Cassidy to the audience room, and the other Warlord Princes had spent that time with Vae, maybe they\u2019d all find the new Queen a lot more palatable.</p><p>Maybe eating breakfast hadn\u2019t been such a good idea, Cassidy thought as she and Theran walked down to the audience room.</p><p>He was ignoring Protocol by walking on her right to indicate his Jewels were dominant instead of walking on her left to indicate his power was in her service. He wasn\u2019t offering his hand in the traditional escort position so that she could rest her hand on top of his. Maybe he thought it wasn\u2019t necessary to follow those formalities until they were closer to the audience room, but the servants they had passed had noticed.</p><p>Prince Theran was sending a message that would trickle through the court and through the Blood who worked in the mansion: the new Queen wasn\u2019t worthy of courtesy or respect.</p><p>He was setting her up to fail before she had a chance to try.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t belong to you. Jaenelle recognized that the moment she saw the two of you in a room together.</p><p>But he was still Grayhaven. The Queen\u2019s residence was his family\u2019s home. The town was named after the Grayhaven estate. Theran\u2019s opinion would matter far more than hers.</p><p>Theran opened a door and said, \u201cThe stairs to the platform are to your left.\u201d</p><p>As she walked into the room and climbed the platform\u2019s steps, she was aware of the silence that rippled from the front of the room to the back.</p><p>During the hours she\u2019d spent at the Keep yesterday, Jaenelle had looked through her clothes and made suggestions for outfits appropriate for various functions. At first, she\u2019d felt a spike of resentment. She wasn\u2019t a child who needed to be told what to wear. In fact, she was five years older than Jaenelle. Then she realized she was being given the confirmation of a Sister, a fellow Queen, that her choices were correct\u2014and the reason for the exercise had been to give her that confirmation, since she wasn\u2019t likely to find any where she was going.</p><p>So she\u2019d dressed with care for this first meeting, but she\u2019d dressed for a working morning in a court\u2014long skirt and matching jacket in a dark green that flattered her red hair and pale skin, along with a pale green shirt.</p><p>As she looked at the men who had made the decision to give their people a Queen from another Realm, she felt their disappointment roll over her like a heavy wave. She didn\u2019t dress like a Queen. She didn\u2019t look like what they had imagined.</p><p>Vae pushed her way to the platform, using shields to add heft to her small body to shove grown men out of her way.</p><p>*These males are grumpy sheep,* Vae said on a distaff thread, female to female. She floated on air above the platform to have the best view of the room. *You should choose the ones that belong to you so the rest can go outside and run.*</p><p>*I don\u2019t think they want to run,* Cassidy replied.</p><p>*I will chase them. They will run. They will be less grumpy when they are tired.*</p><p>She doubted that the Warlord Princes would share Vae\u2019s opinion about what they needed, but the Sceltie wouldn\u2019t care about that. And she wouldn\u2019t care that these men were bigger and some of them were more powerful. She had a job to do, and she would do it.</p><p>And so do you, Cassie. So do you.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, gentlemen,\u201d she said, using Craft to enhance her voice so that she could speak in a normal tone and still be heard at the back of the room. \u201cI am Cassidy, from the Territory of Dharo in the Realm of Kaeleer. I\u2019m here to help you restore Dena Nehele. I\u2019m here to help your people.\u201d</p><p>Disappointment. Despair. Bitterness. She felt those things flow around her. More than other men,Warlord Princes needed a relationship with a Queen to keep them mentally and emotionally balanced. All that power and lethal temper craved a leash. That was one reason so many bad Queens had come into power in this Realm. Once the good Queens were destroyed, the Warlord Princes gave their allegiance to whatever Queens were available\u2014and became corrupted in the process. Or they held out, held themselves back from the very thing they needed, and served an ideal instead of a woman.</p><p>Not many men could do that\u2014and she needed to remember that, in one way or another, all these men had done just that.</p><p>Disappointment. Despair. Bitterness.</p><p>And then a flare of hope.</p><p>Wary. Almost angry. But still hope.</p><p>She watched the Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince nudge other men aside in order to stand before her and stare into her eyes.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if his skin was browned by the sun or if he had that coloring in common with Theran. Dark brown hair and dark brown eyes.</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>She held the leash for this angry, wary man, and he knew it. Something about her called to him, and he couldn\u2019t turn away from her without paying a desperately high price. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho do you consider Dena Nehele\u2019s people?\u201d the Warlord Prince asked.</p><p>The effort he was making to keep his voice neutral told her how important her answer was to him.</p><p>\u201cEveryone who lives within the borders of this Territory,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cLandens as well as Blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the Shalador people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow is not the time for that, Ranon,\u201d Theran snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen when is the time, Grayhaven?\u201d Ranon snapped back.</p><p>\u201cWho are the Shalador people?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s left of a race who came from a Territory that no longer exists. We live on reserves in the southern part of Dena Nehele, land that was granted to us by the Gray Lady.\u201d Ranon gave Theran a hostile look. \u201cLand that\u2019s been trimmed by the hand of every Queen who has ruled since Lia until there\u2019s barely enough farmland to feed us and not enough healthy woodland to supply the game we need.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow is not the time,\u201d Theran said again, shifting into a fighting stance.</p><p>\u201cPrince Theran is right,\u201d Cassidy said as Ranon also shifted into a fighting stance. The odds were against Opal being able to win a fight with Green, but Warlord Princes who served in the same court could not be allowed to fight. \u201cNow is not the time.\u201d</p><p>She saw bitterness in Ranon\u2019s eyes, but she pushed on. \u201cWhat you have said deserves more thought and discussion than I can give it this morning. But we will discuss the concerns of your people, as well as the other people who live in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>Hers. She saw it in his eyes as he relaxed a little and stepped back from the killing edge. Even if he\u2019d hated her answer, he would have served in her court. It would have damaged something inside him, but he would have served.</p><p>Five more Warlord Princes made their way to the front of the room to stand before the platform. The connection, the need for what she was, wasn\u2019t as strong with them as she\u2019d felt with Ranon, but it was there. For the first time, she felt the weight of being a Queen, of holding lives in her hands.</p><p>She stepped back to the center of the platform. As Theran announced each man, he came up on the platform, knelt before her, and said, \u201cYour will is my life. Take what you need.\u201d</p> <p>Surrender. Loyalty. At least for the next year.</p><p>Theran had knelt before her and said those words with Prince Sadi and the High Lord as witnesses. He hadn\u2019t meant them. They\u2019d all known that last night.</p><p>But Ranon and the other five Warlord Princes did mean the words\u2014and the fact that they did mean the words terrified them.</p><p>Scared her too.</p><p>When the chosen stood at the back of the platform, Cassidy turned to Theran. \u201cWho else is waiting to be considered for the First Circle?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the remaining Warlord Princes, then at her. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissing the men who are here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re best suited for this First Circle,\u201d Cassidy replied quietly. \u201cI would like to meet with the others before making further decisions. But I need some air and some time to think. We\u2019ll reconvene in two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I remind you that you have seven males,\u201d Theran said, shifting so most of the men couldn\u2019t see that he was getting angry. \u201cYou need twelve to form a court. If you dismiss these men now, you may not get any of them back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that.\u201d</p><p>Walkies!Vae shouted. *You males will go for walkies now. You can mark the trees. Human males do that sometimes. And I will teach you how to play fetch.*</p><p>Vae leaped from the platform and sailed over the men\u2019s heads, landing in the middle of the room\u2014an impossible thing to do without Craft. She disappeared for a moment, then popped up shoulder height, her tail smacking faces as she began herding the men out the door.</p><p>Theran was angry. This audience hadn\u2019t gone as he\u2019d wanted, and by turning the Warlord Princes away, she was taking the risk of not being able to form a court. If she couldn\u2019t form a court, whatever favors he had called in would have been wasted, so she couldn\u2019t blame him for feeling upset.</p><p>Ranon, on the other hand, looked more relaxed as he came up to stand on her left side. Baffled, but more relaxed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a relentless little bitch, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Ranon asked, tipping his head to indicate Vae.</p><p>The knot in Cassidy\u2019s stomach eased as she watched Warlord Princes obeying a dog because they couldn\u2019t figure out how not to obey the dog. That, at least, felt like home.</p><p>She smiled at Ranon. \u201cOf course. She\u2019s a Sceltie.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Gray pressed himself against the big stone gardening shed, his limbs trembling, his heart racing, as if his body were still trying to outrun the nightmares that had filled his sleep last night.</p><p>There was a Queen at Grayhaven. He could feel her presence, even out here. She would be living in that suite of rooms, in that room, doing . . . things.</p><p>His back muscles, which had never fully healed on the left side, tightened in response to his fear, threatening to spasm and leave him helpless to run, to hide until she lost interest in looking for him.</p><p>I\u2019m Grayhaven. I\u2019m Grayhaven!</p><p>Theran\u2019s blade. He never betrayed his cousin, had protected Theran in the only way he could. Even when the bitch did those things to him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t remember that. Couldn\u2019t. Theran was living in the mansion now. With her. No secrets. Not anymore. She knew Theran was the real Grayhaven.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t get near the house. He had tried because Theran was in there, but he couldn\u2019t get near the house. Talon had brought him food last night, and the men who worked in the stables had let him use their toilet and shower so he wouldn\u2019t have to go near the house.</p><p>Her presence tingled under the land, even here at the edge of what had been the formal gardens. He didn\u2019t remember that happening the last time. The gardens had been as close to a safe place as there had been when he\u2019d been a prisoner here. The Queen had him shackled and staked to a long chain, like a pony being put out to graze. Let him stagger around the old gardens\u2014or crawl when his tortured body couldn\u2019t do more. Left him where he could see the dead honey pear tree, the symbol of the Grayhaven Queens who had stood against Dorothea SaDiablo. Dead like their bloodline. Dead for so many years, but kept as a reminder that those Queens had not endured.</p><p>Jared had given that honey pear tree to Lia, who had tended it all her life.</p><p>Who could say if it was the same tree? But everyone believed it was, and that was all that really mattered.</p><p>Hope. Life. Love. All dead, like the tree.</p><p>That\u2019s what the last Queen had taught him.</p><p>Then Talon had found him, rescued him. And with Talon\u2019s help,Theran had done what he could to help Gray rebuild some kind of life.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t what he should have been. He knew that sometimes, could sense that something had been lost.</p><p>He would stay here because Theran was here, and Talon was here. But . . .</p><p>He felt her presence, felt her psychic scent as a heat against his skin.</p><p>But it was a pleasant heat, like beams of sunlight coming through a window on a day in early spring.</p><p>He peered around the corner of the shed and saw her walking toward him. But not looking for him. No, she was looking at the land.</p><p>Her scent said \u201cQueen,\u201d but she didn\u2019t look like a Queen, wasn\u2019t dressed like a Queen. She looked . . . friendly. And her hair . . .</p><p>He watched as she pulled the pins from her hair and it tumbled around her shoulders and down her back.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen red hair. He\u2019d read stories where people had red hair, but he\u2019d never seen anyone in real life. And she had spots on her face. Why did she have spots on her face? Such pale skin. What color were her eyes?</p><p>With his heart pounding, Gray stepped away from the stone shed and walked toward her slowly, fearfully. It wasn\u2019t safe. It wasn\u2019t. But he wanted, needed, to see the color of her eyes.</p><p>Cassidy watched him walk toward her. A good-looking man with a strong physical resemblance to Theran, right down to the dark hair and green eyes. Family, perhaps?</p><p>A well-toned body of a physically active adult male. But his psychic scent said \u201cyouth,\u201d even \u201cboy,\u201d which was a sure sign of something wrong, and that wasn\u2019t good because inside that body . . .</p><p>Warlord Prince. Wild. Wounded.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>The thought startled her, made her heart pound because it seemed to recognize something about this man that her mind wasn\u2019t ready to acknowledge.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the same feeling of recognition that she\u2019d had with the Warlord Princes who were now in her First Circle. This was different. Personal.</p><p>So wounded inside. She could see it in his green eyes now that he was close enough. He looked like he was ready to run, and yet he kept moving toward her as if he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>He stopped at the sound of her voice, shifting his weight from one foot to another, not sure if he should get closer or step back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Gray,\u201d he finally said, taking another step toward her.</p><p>His eyes roamed her face. When he got close enough, he reached out, almost touching her cheek. Then he snatched his hand back, like a boy who had almost touched the forbidden.</p><p>Wondering what he saw that baffled and intrigued him so much, she touched her cheek to see if something was on her skin.</p><p>Oh. She wrinkled her nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen freckles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreckles.\u201d He said the word softly, as if it were a fragile gift. \u201cAre they just on your face?\u201d</p><p>She knew her cheeks flamed with color. She also knew that, despite the man\u2019s body, it was a boy asking out of curiosity. Still . . .</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know you well enough to answer that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, accepting.</p><p>He was half a head taller than she, if that. It would have been easy enough to look him in the eyes if his own weren\u2019t so busy roaming over her face.</p><p>\u201cDid you come out to look at the gardens?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He cringed, as if she had scolded him for doing something wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI tend the gardens. It\u2019s my job now. I don\u2019t stay in the big house. I\u2019m not in the way.\u201d</p><p>Who said you were in the way?</p><p>His voice had risen to a kind of desperate keening and he looked ready to bolt, so she turned toward what might have been a flower bed at one time. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve certainly got enough work. This land hasn\u2019t been loved in a long time.\u201d</p> <p>Something changed so suddenly, she gasped in response to that flash of strong emotion. She couldn\u2019t decipher the look in Gray\u2019s eyes, couldn\u2019t get a feel for where he was now, mentally or emotionally. Which wasn\u2019t good because even if he was diminished in some way, he was still a Warlord Prince and he outranked her. She couldn\u2019t tell if the Purple Dusk power she was sensing was from his Birthright Jewel or his Jewel of rank, but either way, it was darker than her Rose.</p><p>And then, oddly, she had the feeling that some broken piece inside him suddenly settled back into its rightful place.</p><p>A moment after that, it was as if nothing had happened. Except that Gray seemed a little less like a boy.</p><p>\u201cNo, it hasn\u2019t been loved for a long time,\u201d he said.</p><p>Too many feelings. She\u2019d come out here to walk and get away from all the feelings, to do something to settle herself before she went back to the next group of males who would be disappointed in the chosen Queen.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have a basket or a wheelbarrow?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe have both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I have an hour before the next meeting, so that\u2019s enough time to clear a bit of ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear ground?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeed the flower bed.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cYou can\u2019t weed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you\u2019re the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his heels, clearly at a loss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Queen who lives in this house now, so these are my gardens, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said warily.</p><p>\u201cSo these are my weeds. And since I\u2019m the Queen, I can pull weeds if I want to. Right?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t quick to agree. Well, he was a Warlord Prince. They were never quick to agree about anything. Unless it was their idea in the first place.</p> <p>Finally he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get dirty. It rained last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it rained. Which means the soil will be softer, and the weeds will be easier to pull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll get dirty.\u201d He frowned at the hem of her skirt, which had already picked up some moisture from brushing the top of the grass.</p><p>\u201cI can\u201d\u2014she looked toward the stone shed, saw him stiffen, and looked the other way\u2014\u201cchange clothes behind those bushes while you get the wheelbarrow.\u201d</p><p>Not giving him time to argue, she hurried behind the bushes, vanished her good clothes, then called in the old shirt and trousers she usually wore for gardening. As she stuffed her legs into the trousers, she caught a heel of her shoe in the hem and hopped for a few steps, saying words her father pretended she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cShould have used Craft, Cassie,\u201d she muttered as she finally got the heel clear of the hem. \u201cPass the shoe through the cloth and you\u2019re less likely to topple over and fall on your ass.\u201d</p><p>Once she got the trousers on, she buttoned up the long-sleeved shirt, and quickly braided her hair, using Craft to secure the end of the braid.</p><p>\u201cGood enough,\u201d she muttered as she hurried back to the flower bed, returning at the same time Gray arrived with the rattling wheelbarrow.</p><p>\u201cThese are a bit rusty, but I found a couple of short-handled claws that are good for loosening soil and digging out weeds,\u201d he said. He hesitated, shifting his weight from one foot to the other as he kept glancing at her face and then looking away.</p><p>Finally he said, \u201cYour skin is very pale.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy wrinkled her nose. \u201cPale skin goes with the red hair.\u201d Unlike her brother Clayton\u2019s, her skin never changed to that soft gold color when she spent time in the sun. It just went from milk to cooked lobster.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes aren\u2019t brown, but they aren\u2019t green either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe color is called hazel. Doesn\u2019t anyone have eyes like that here?\u201d</p><p>Gray shook his head. \u201cBrown and blue mostly. Some green. None like yours. They\u2019re pretty.\u201d</p><p>A little flutter of feminine pleasure. The only man who had thought anything about her was pretty was her father, and fathers never saw daughters in the same way as other men, so Poppi\u2019s opinion didn\u2019t really count.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t something she would ever say to Poppi.</p><p>Gray took a step back, as if he was leaving.</p><p>\u201cI know you have other work to do,\u201d Cassidy said,\u201cbut could you stay a few minutes and point out some of the good plants?\u201d She wanted him to stay. This place didn\u2019t feel as lonely now that she\u2019d met him.</p><p>Another hesitation. \u201cYou want me to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d He seemed to be mulling over a lot more than spending an hour weeding a flower bed. \u201cYou should wear a hat to protect your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I . . .\u201d He was right, of course. But somehow in the past few minutes he\u2019d made some transition from scared younger boy to bossy older boy. Politely bossy, but she remembered a childhood afternoon visit with her cousin Aaron, which had been her first experience with being around a Warlord Prince of any age, and she still remembered that particular tone of bossiness that no one but a Warlord Prince could achieve.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a hat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have a hat, but . . . You\u2019ll laugh at my hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t laugh,\u201d Gray said quickly, putting one hand over his heart. Then he thought for a moment and added, \u201cI\u2019ll try not to laugh.\u201d</p><p>Good enough.</p><p>She called in her gardening hat and plunked it on her head. It was a simple straw hat with a wide brim that kept the sun off her face and neck.</p><p>Gray didn\u2019t laugh, but his smile kept getting wider and wider as he studied her hat.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it have a chunk missing from one side?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause my brother was teasing me last summer and holding it behind his back\u2014and didn\u2019t notice when the goat snuck up behind him and took a bite out of it.\u201d</p><p>His smile got even wider. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it have ribbons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI use Craft to keep it in place.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, and still smiling, he handed her one of the short-handled claws. \u201cI\u2019ll show you what doesn\u2019t belong in this garden.\u201d</p><p>Where in the name of Hell did she go? Theran scanned the weed-tangled mess of raised beds that framed a terrace before he headed for the rest of the formal gardens.</p><p>She\u2019d said she wanted a little air and would be back shortly. That had been over an hour ago. A meal, and the men, were waiting for her return so they could get on with the rest of these meetings.</p><p>Considering how bad everything looked, what could Lady Cassidy find out here that would amuse her for so long?</p><p>The answer punched his heart. He lengthened his stride as he headed for the big stone shed. It had held the groundskeeper\u2019s office at one time, but had become a catchall for unwanted tools. He\u2019d helped Gray clear out the smaller room in the shed and put in a cot, a small chest of drawers, and a bookcase.</p><p>Gray was used to living rough. So was he. But here, with the mansion in sight, it seemed . . . meaner, coarser.</p><p>It was all Gray could tolerate.</p><p>If Cassidy thought she could play with a damaged man just because Gray wasn\u2019t able to fight back, she\u2019d find out the truth quick enough. He, Theran, wasn\u2019t fifteen anymore, didn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014hide anymore. And Gray wasn\u2019t standing alone anymore, facing something that terrified him.</p><p>He spotted Gray and hurried toward his cousin, no longer caring if he found Cassidy. A wheelbarrow full of weeds was on Gray\u2019s left and someone\u2014he caught a glimpse of a straw hat\u2014was on the other side of the wheelbarrow.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s called pearl of wisdom,\u201d Gray said, pointing to a plant. \u201cSee? The flower has a sheen like the inside of a shell, and the seedpod looks like a pearl. The flower only blooms for a couple of weeks in the spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d Theran called, wondering what servant had befriended his cousin.</p><p>Gray looked around, a queer wariness in his eyes before he spotted Theran.</p><p>\u201cTheran!\u201d he said happily.</p><p>From the other side of the wheelbarrow, a husky voice said, \u201cOh, shit. Theran.\u201d</p><p>When she popped up, it took him a moment to recognize her. She was the only person in Dena Nehele who had red hair, but it still took him a moment to recognize her.</p><p>Not a Queen. Despite her caste, she was not a Queen.</p><p>\u201cHas an hour gone by already?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd then some. We\u2019ve held the midday meal, thinking you would be back soon.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep the tightness out of his voice, couldn\u2019t even keep it on the right side of respectful.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Prince Theran.\u201d There was a tightness in her voice too as she stood up and vanished that stupid hat. \u201cI\u2019ll wash up and join you as soon as I can. Please tell the men not to wait for me. They shouldn\u2019t have to eat cold food just because I lost track of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe live to serve,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>She winced and wouldn\u2019t meet his eyes as she hurried back to the mansion.</p><p>Theran watched her for a moment, then looked at Gray. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>That queer wariness was back in Gray\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>What did she do to you? He couldn\u2019t ask, but he knew something wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><p>As he turned to go back to the mansion, Gray said,\u201cTheran? She knows the land needs to be loved. The Queens who have been living here haven\u2019t cared about that.\u201d</p><p>A message there, but Gray had always had a sensitivity to the land, being more aware of it than the people around him were. That sensitivity had heightened after he\u2019d been rescued. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not afraid of her, Gray, Theran thought as he walked back to the mansion, but what kind of Queen cares more about digging in the dirt than taking care of the people?</p><p>It took most of the afternoon to meet the Warlords who wanted to be considered for the court. Three belonged to her and were suited to serve in her First Circle. The others wanted status, safety, something else. Whatever it was, they wouldn\u2019t find it with her.</p><p>Several Warlords who lived in the town of Grayhaven would be an asset in one of the other twelve circles that made up a court, and she hoped they would accept the offer when the Steward made it on her behalf.</p> <p>Once she found a Steward. And a Master of the Guard.</p><p>And with every man who wasn\u2019t accepted, Theran tensed a little more.</p><p>Toward the end of the afternoon the first, and only, Prince arrived. A middle-aged man whose skin sagged as if he\u2019d once been hefty but hadn\u2019t eaten well in quite some time and whose left hand had been broken and badly healed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Powell?\u201d Archerr asked in a challenging voice.</p><p>\u201cI would like to be considered for a position in the court,\u201d Powell replied courteously, looking at Cassidy. \u201cI\u2019m good at organizing schedules and duties.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re also good at skimming off a percentage of the Queen\u2019s tithes,\u201d Archerr snapped.</p><p>\u201cThat was never proved,\u201d Ranon snapped in return.</p><p>Why would Ranon defend a man accused of stealing from a Queen? Unless the Warlord Prince knew, or suspected, something about Powell that the rest of the men didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cDid you steal from the Queen you served?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Powell replied.</p><p>Mutters from the Warlords and Warlord Princes who had remained in the room. Snarls from several of the Warlord Princes who were in her First Circle, but she couldn\u2019t tell if they were snarling at Powell or at one another.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Province Queen I served liked luxury,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWell, they all did, didn\u2019t they? And it was the tithes from the District Queens that had to support those luxuries. It was hard to walk through the town where the Queen lived and see children who were hungry or who were wearing clothes and shoes too patched and torn to be useful. So sometimes a few coins would find their way back to a family for food or clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIs that why your hand was broken?\u201d</p><p>Powell nodded. \u201cMost people were careful to spread out the spending. One man was not. I claimed to have given the man some coins from my own wages, and the Queen couldn\u2019t prove otherwise. That\u2019s why she had my left hand broken instead of maiming the right hand.\u201d</p><p>In Kaeleer, a tribunal of Queens would have known you were lying within minutes, Cassidy thought. But their wrath would have been aimed at the Queen who had mistreated her people and not you.</p><p>\u201cI have to trust that the people who serve me will work for the good of Dena Nehele,\u201d Cassidy said to Powell. \u201cI understand your reasons, and I can\u2019t say you were wrong. But everyone is going to be living lean for a while, and tithes will be necessary to support the court and take care of the expenses that come with the court. If you think someone is being tithed unfairly, I need to know. But the amount of the tithe, unfair or not, will be my decision. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Lady. That is understood,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, are you willing to wear the Steward\u2019s ring?\u201d</p> <p>Silence. Disbelief from Theran that he didn\u2019t bother to hide. Surprise from the other men in her First Circle. Except for Ranon. He looked thoughtful.</p><p>\u201cI would be honored to serve as your Steward,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>A commotion at the back of the room. Anger and resistance coming from the men nearest the door. Anger and a flash of worry coming from Ranon.</p><p>Vae launched herself into the men, using shields to plow a wide path that left several men staggering to keep their balance.</p><p>*Bad males!* Vae shouted. *Bad!*</p><p>The men glanced at the platform, then stepped away, since Cassidy wasn\u2019t calling Vae off.</p><p>A woman, a witch, approached the platform.</p><p>\u201cYour kind shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Theran said at the same time Ranon said, \u201cShira.\u201d</p><p>He loves her, Cassidy thought, watching Ranon\u2019s effort to remain neutral. But he didn\u2019t want her to come here. Why?</p><p>\u201cI have as much right to be here as you do, Theran Grayhaven,\u201d Shira said. Her omitting his title was a deliberate slap in the face. \u201cYou can trace your bloodline back to Jared. I can trace my bloodline back to Jared\u2019s cousin Shira. So if I don\u2019t belong here, neither do you.\u201d</p><p>Since that particular verbal slap left Theran speechless, Cassidy jumped in. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Sister?\u201d</p><p>Shira looked at her. \u201cI want to offer my services. I\u2019m a fully qualified Healer and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all you are,\u201d Theran snapped.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t all Shira was. The hourglass pendant she wore above her Summer-sky Jewel proclaimed her to be something more powerful\u2014and more dangerous\u2014than a Healer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of what I am,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>\u201cWhy should you be?\u201d Cassidy asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve completed your training in the Hourglass\u2019s Craft?\u201d The question was a formality. The pendant Shira wore, with all the gold dust in the bottom half of the hourglass, indicated a Black Widow who had completed her training and could spin the tangled webs of dreams and visions, as well as help people caught in the Twisted Kingdom. The Black Widows were also the caste of witches who were well versed in the making and use of poisons.</p><p>\u201cHer kind were outlawed generations ago,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a natural Black Widow?\u201d Cassidy asked Shira.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only kind there are in Dena Nehele,\u201d Shira replied.</p><p>\u201cThe penalty for training anyone in that Craft is execution,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>Ranon snarled at Theran.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Cassidy said, using Craft to enhance her voice. She waited until they had all quieted down. Then waited until a couple of Warlords got done swearing after Vae nipped them because they didn\u2019t quiet fast enough to suit the Sceltie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here because you wanted a Queen who knows the Old Ways of the Blood, who lives by the Old Ways of the Blood, and who will require that you live by that Protocol and code of honor. That means a good many things that you knew no longer apply.\u201d Cassidy turned in her chair and looked at Theran. \u201cYou say Black Widows were outlawed. How many of the Queens who controlled Dena Nehele had Black Widows in their courts? My guess is all of them did. What was outlawed were the Black Widows who wouldn\u2019t serve in those courts. The ones whose skills would endanger a Queen who was hated.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going back to the Old Ways, gentlemen, and in the Old Ways the Hourglass is an honored caste of witches. They are not outlaws. Their training is not outlawed.\u201d Cassidy turned to look at Shira. \u201cIf you accept the position of court Healer, you would have to reside here. Are you prepared to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Shira replied.</p><p>\u201cThen welcome to the court, Sister.\u201d</p><p>*You\u2019re forgetting something, Lady,* Theran said. *We don\u2019t have a court. There are only eleven males.*</p><p>*No,* Cassidy said, *there\u2019s\u2014* Gray, she finished silently.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to be part of her court. Couldn\u2019t be part of her court. Not as he was.</p><p>But he could have been\u2014should have been\u2014if he had been whole.</p><p>Ranon looked at the men on the platform, his expression grim. He too must have just realized they didn\u2019t have an official court.</p><p>\u201cIs the other Warlord Prince still planning to present himself?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>Theran shot him a hostile look. \u201cHe is.\u201dA glance at the windows. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here as soon as the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>And this Warlord Prince, whoever he is, is the reason the men who weren\u2019t selected have been waiting.</p><p>Folding her hands on the table, Cassidy looked at the windows at the other end of the room.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d her cousin Aaron had said, glancing out a window. \u201cThe sun has almost set.\u201d</p><p>She knew what it signified when someone wasn\u2019t usually available before sunset. So she knew what these men were waiting for.</p><p>He arrived within minutes after the sun had gone down, too soon to have taken care of his own needs. An older man, maimed by battles. Sapphire Jewel, which made him the dominant male. But it was more than that. As she watched him approach, she also watched the other men and had a flash of insight gleaned from her months in the Dark Court. She\u2019d seen the men in that First Circle, including her cousin Aaron, step aside for Andulvar Yaslana with the same respect the men in this room were showing this demon-dead Warlord Prince. He had trained them, had been an honorary uncle or a surrogate father to many of them.</p><p>They had survived because of what he\u2019d taught them.</p><p>He looked straight ahead while he walked the length of the room, finally looking at her when he reached the edge of the platform.</p><p>She felt the punch of that connection\u2014and felt the same wariness she saw in his eyes. He hadn\u2019t expected to feel that pull. Neither had she. She would have accepted him into the First Circle because of the feelings she was sensing from her other males, but she hadn\u2019t expected him to belong to her.</p><p>She watched him climb the stairs, then rose when he approached the table.</p><p>Protocol. Her insides were quivering because he was, without question, the most dangerous man in the room. But she knew the words and the rituals, not just for dealing with a Warlord Prince, but for dealing with the demon-dead.</p><p>\u201cPrince,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLady.\u201d He tipped his head in a slight bow. \u201cI am Talon.\u201d His eyes narrowed as he studied her face. \u201cDo you know what I am?\u201d</p><p>She smiled slightly. \u201cMy Master of the Guard.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hide his surprise. \u201cI am honored, Lady, but that wasn\u2019t what I meant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re demon-dead.

And Talon\u2019s expression was equally blank.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unfamiliar with that particular vintage?\u201d Cassidy asked Talon.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d he replied warily.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d What had he been consuming if he didn\u2019t know about yarbarah?</p><p>Best not to think about that because she was certain that whatever had been given had not been given according to the Protocol and rituals that had been created for transactions between the living and the demon-dead.</p><p>She called in the simple wooden box her father had made for the gift the High Lord had given her when she\u2019d finished her apprenticeship in the Dark Court. Pressing the two spots on the sides to release the latches, she removed the cover, revealing the small silver cup and silver-handled knife. She set the cup on the table, pushed up her left sleeve, and, before anyone knew for certain what she intended, picked up the knife and opened a vein in her wrist.</p><p>A wash of sounds and protests was drowned out by the snarl of a Sceltie who knew her Craft.</p><p>*Stay!* Vae growled. *This is ceremony!*</p> <p>Ceremony. Ritual. Sometimes formal, sometimes casual, but always, always precise in the intention.</p><p>As soon as the cup was filled, she turned the blade of the knife flat against her wrist, hiding the wound as she used the Healing Craft she\u2019d been taught to seal this kind of cut.</p><p>Setting the knife on the table, she held out the cup to Talon. \u201cFreely offered,\u201d she said, knowing every man in the room would remember the words. \u201cFreely taken.\u201d</p><p>Talon hesitated, then took the cup, his hunger apparent in his face. \u201cYou honor me, Lady.\u201d</p><p>Two swallows. That was all the cup held. But blood freely offered had a different flavor from blood that was soured by fear.</p><p>Talon recognized the difference, even if he wasn\u2019t quite sure of the reason.</p><p>He set the cup on the table with great care.</p><p>\u201cIs that dog going to bite me if I heal your wrist?\u201d Shira asked.</p> <p>In answer, Cassidy held out her wrist, all the permission her Healer needed.</p><p>As soon as Shira finished the healing, Cassidy vanished the cup, knife, and box, preferring to clean them in private.</p><p>She looked at Theran. Was he relieved a formal court was established? Upset about her offering her blood to Talon? She couldn\u2019t read him, couldn\u2019t tell what he was thinking.</p><p>And she suddenly felt too tired to care.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, it\u2019s been a long day. Prince Powell, please send the Province Queens my regrets and ask them to meet me tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>Tense silence.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t the Province Queens aware that the Warlord Princes chose a Territory Queen?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cThere are no Province Queens,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cAll Territories are divided into Provinces and Districts,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThere must be Province Queens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all died two years ago,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThe psychic storm that swept through Terreille took all of them.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy sank into the chair behind the table. \u201cDistrict Queens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThe ones who are too old or weak to be a threat to anyone. Or the ones too young to form a court and rule anything.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful. She\u2019d thought the Warlord Princes of Dena Nehele had gone outside their own Territory because there wasn\u2019t a Queen they were willing to have rule over all of them. Theran hadn\u2019t said there weren\u2019t any Queens to help her.</p><p>She pressed both hands flat against the table and closed her eyes. What was she supposed to do?</p><p>Poppi laying out the pieces of wood, the nails and screws, the tools.</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re not sure of what you\u2019ve got, Kitten, lay it all out and take a look,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you decide if you can make something out of what you\u2019ve got, even if it wasn\u2019t the thing you had in mind. Or you figure out what else you need in order to make what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Powell,\u201d Cassidy said, keeping her eyes closed because it was easier to deal with them all when she imagined she was talking to Poppi or her brother, Clayton. \u201cI need a map of Dena Nehele that will show me the whole of the Territory and the Provinces. Then I need maps of each Province that will show me all the towns, villages, and cities, both Blood and landen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look in the Steward\u2019s office and see what I can find,\u201d Powell said.</p><p>\u201cThen I need a list of all the Queens in Dena Nehele, where each one lives, and what Jewels she wears. That includes the girls who aren\u2019t yet old enough to rule. I also need a list of the Warlord Princes, where they live, and their rank. Prince Talon, you\u2019ll be in charge of obtaining that information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cThe Shalador Queens who are left survived by not making their whereabouts known. None of them are going to want to be on a hunting list.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy opened her eyes and looked at Ranon. \u201cThen you\u2019ll have to convince them.\u201d</p><p>A flash of something in his dark eyes told her how deeply his loyalties were being challenged\u2014and his choice would tell her whether she could trust him.</p><p>He looked in her eyes and said, \u201cYour will is my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Cassidy asked. When no one spoke, she pushed her chair back and stood up. \u201cIn that case, gentlemen, I would prefer to dine in my rooms this evening, so I\u2019ll bid you a good evening. Lady Shira, would you join me?\u201d</p><p>Shira looked startled and stammered her answer. \u201cIt would be my pleasure, Lady.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy didn\u2019t give Theran time to protest or even think to offer himself as escort, which he should have done. She didn\u2019t care how it looked or what the men thought. She hustled Shira out of the room, and the only person who made an effort to catch up to them was Vae.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to dine with your court?\u201d Shira asked.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d Cassidy replied.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling tired because of the blood loss?\u201d</p><p>*She is just tired of talking to males,Vae said, trotting ahead of them. *You are female, so you are not yappy like males.*</p><p>Vae turned a corner, leading the way back to Cassidy\u2019s suite. The two women walked in silence for a minute. Then Shira said, \u201cIs she always so honest?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy sighed. \u201cShe\u2019s a Sceltie.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Gray rolled the wheelbarrow to the edge of the partially weeded flower bed, just as he\u2019d done for the past few days. weeded flower bed, just as he\u2019d done for the past few</p><p>Cassie hadn\u2019t come back. She knew the land needed to be loved, and he\u2019d thought she\u2019d enjoyed working in the garden. So why didn\u2019t she come back?</p><p>He\u2019d felt good working with her, listening to that husky voice as she asked him questions about the flowers. Smelling her, although he hadn\u2019t dared get close enough to get a good sniff.</p><p>He dreamed about her last night. Not a bad dream like he had sometimes about the other Queen. In this dream, Cassidy was helping him into a beautiful coat that had been made just for him. But it didn\u2019t quite fit. It frustrated him\u2014and scared him\u2014that it didn\u2019t quite fit. Then Cassie had smiled sadly and told him the coat couldn\u2019t be changed. If he wanted to wear it, he would have to change until it fit him the way it should.</p><p>He woke up with his heart pounding, on the verge of tears. He wanted to wear that coat. Had been born to wear that coat. But he didn\u2019t know how to change to make it fit.</p><p>Cassie knew. Cassie would help him change in the right way.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t she come back?</p><p>Maybe he could find Theran. Maybe he could go inside the house long enough to find Theran and ask why Cassie hadn\u2019t come back.</p><p>Shivering at the thought of being inside those walls again, Gray turned to look at the house . . . and saw Cassie standing right there, holding a large tray.</p><p>He yelped. She jumped back, and the dishes on the tray rattled. He jumped forward to grab the tray\u2014and his hands closed over hers. Touched her skin.</p><p>He stared at their hands and wanted to touch her skin forever.</p><p>\u201cGray? Are you all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I startled you. I guess you didn\u2019t hear me calling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me on a psychic thread?\u201d His heart pounded, but he wasn\u2019t sure if it was fear or happiness.</p><p>Cassie looked startled. \u201cOh. No. I didn\u2019t want to intrude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be intruding.\u201d He wanted to hear her inside his head, wanted to feel her inside him. But . . . maybe not too far inside him. Even if she already knew the secret the other Queen had tried to rip out of his mind, maybe it wasn\u2019t safe to let her inside too many of his inner barriers. But he wouldn\u2019t have to open any of his inner barriers in order to talk to her on a psychic thread.</p><p>\u201cI brought some breakfast,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d eaten yet, so I brought enough for two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat.\u201d He\u2019d gotten some food from the stable hands, but not enough to fill him.</p><p>Cassidy used Craft to balance the tray on air. Then she poured coffee for both of them. Splitting two rolls so they formed pockets, she handed one to Gray before spreading a thin layer of jam inside the other and filling it with scrambled eggs.</p><p>\u201cEgg sandwich,\u201d Cassidy said, smiling. \u201cMy father would make these out of whatever eggs were left over from breakfast, and put them in a chill box to eat later in the morning when he took a break from his work. For all the years they\u2019ve been married, I\u2019m still not sure he knows that my mother cooks extra just so he can make his egg sandwich.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gray stuffed the roll with scrambled eggs, then smeared a little jam on part of the roll. He took a bite and made a face.</p><p>\u201cToo sweet?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, glad he hadn\u2019t smeared any more of the roll. \u201cBut it\u2019s good,\u201d he added quickly.</p> <p>She laughed. She had a wonderful laugh, warm and earthy. Not the bright, brittle sound of cruelty.</p><p>\u201cMy mother and I like the jam with the eggs. My brother prefers this red sauce that\u2019s a little spicy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds better.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an odd look\u2014and an even odder smile. Not bad, just odd.</p><p>He ate his sandwich and drank his coffee, not sure what else to do.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t come back,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI brought the barrow out for you each day, but you didn\u2019t come back.\u201d He\u2019d also watered that flower bed late each night so the ground would stay rain soft and be easier for her to dig.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to come back, but there\u2019s been an awful lot of work to do. All these meetings and reports . . . Every time I\u2019ve tried to take an hour in the garden, Theran has herded me to another meeting. I think he\u2019s spending too much time with Vae, and he\u2019s turning into a Sceltie.\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed. He\u2019d met the Sceltie and was more than willing to play a short game of fetch with her, but she did spend more time with Theran.</p><p>Cassidy poured more coffee for both of them. \u201cLast night I decided I can only work so long and so hard without taking some time for myself, and I can spend some time in the garden each morning before getting cleaned up for the business part of the day.\u201d</p><p>Gray felt light enough to float. \u201cYou\u2019re going to come every day?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI need some time to be Cassidy before I have to be \u2018the Queen.\u2019 I know there\u2019s so much work to be done, but I need some time in the garden. I need this time.\u201d</p> <p>Me too.</p><p>He set his cup back on the tray. \u201cThen let\u2019s not waste the time you have to be Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Cassidy headed back to the house. Her arms and shoulders were a little tired and achy, but it was a good feeling to let her body work while her mind rested. Or while her mind focused on something besides maps and lists and persuading wary men to trust her enough to give her accurate information.</p><p>The Warlord Princes didn\u2019t trust Queens. They needed them for themselves and for the rest of Dena Nehele, but they didn\u2019t trust the caste of witches who had represented a brutal control for so long. Even the males who belonged to her were circling warily, and each action, each piece of information offered, was a way of testing the ground to find out what she would do, how she would respond.</p><p>Shira too was wary, but that had to do with her being a Black Widow and coming from the Shalador reserves. She wasn\u2019t used to being accepted.</p><p>Were Shira and Ranon lovers? Or were they still dancing around each other?</p><p>Not her problem\u2014she hoped. But wouldn\u2019t it be lovely to watch two people fall in love?</p><p>About the only person here whom she could simply talk to was Gray, but even Gray was struggling with something whenever he was around her. At least they could talk about plants. At least there was the companionship and satisfaction of working together and seeing results.</p> <p>Hours spent poring over maps might accomplish something in the long run, but an hour spent weeding a flower bed provided results she could see.</p><p>And Gray had provided her with something else this morning. She\u2019d already sent her first report to Prince Sadi and a note to her mother, but now she had a reason to write to Clayton\u2014and wouldn\u2019t her brother be surprised at her request to send her a jar of the red sauce he liked so much?</p><p>Her smile widened to a grin as she pictured Clayton\u2019s face when he read the note. Yes, this morning\u2014</p><p>\u201cLady.\u201d</p><p>\u2014had been a good morning. \u201cPrince Theran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince Powell has been waiting to go over the reports with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Steward has plenty to do,\u201d Cassidy said with stiff polite-ness. \u201cTalking to me an hour ago or an hour from now won\u2019t make any difference. And if I was truly needed for something immediately, I wasn\u2019t hard to find.\u201d</p><p>Theran\u2019s lips tightened, as if he was struggling to hold back words that shouldn\u2019t be said.</p><p>\u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse me, Prince, I need to get ready for the day\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside, letting her pass.</p><p>She wanted to like him, if for no better reason than he was her First Escort and that required them to work closely. But as she walked to her suite, she wondered if it was worth the effort to try to like a man who was making it more clear every day that he didn\u2019t like her.</p><p>Bitch.</p><p>Theran stared at the gardens, at the plot of ground that was noticeably cleaner, and at his cousin who was still out there, sweating too hard over some damn patch of dirt. A wrong move when the back muscles were tight and tired and Gray would be down for days, sedated to quiet the pain.</p><p>But Cassidy had to have her ground cleared instead of focusing on what needed to be done, so Gray was out there working too long and too hard.</p><p>Damn her. Why couldn\u2019t she leave the boy alone?</p><p>He\u2019d done his best to keep her occupied, to pile up the work until she didn\u2019t have a minute to think about playing with Gray and pushing the boy to tidy up the posies. But he hadn\u2019t gotten to her room fast enough this morning to stop her, hadn\u2019t even known she\u2019d left her rooms until he\u2019d knocked on her door to find out when she planned to get to work and Birdie had told him she was already gone.</p><p>Gone. Yeah, she was gone. And how long would it be before she got tired of watching Gray dig up weeds and figured out something else she could do with him?</p><p>Not going to happen, Theran thought as he went back into the house. He and Gray were the same height, the same build. They both had dark hair and green eyes. The women he\u2019d bedded had considered him a good-looking man and skilled enough to be welcomed back for a second night.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want Cassidy. Who would? But her voice was the kind that could heat a man\u2019s blood\u2014as long as he didn\u2019t have to look at her face.</p><p>So he\u2019d do his duty to court and family\u2014and give Lady Cassidy enough reasons not to give Gray another thought.</p><p>Theran couldn\u2019t put off the unpalatable duty any longer. Cassidy had retired to her suite, and the First Circle was ready to have an hour or two without dancing for the Queen\u2019s pleasure. Not that there had been any dancing. Or much of anything else once they had gathered in this sitting room after dinner.</p><p>Picking up the shawl Cassidy had left behind, he smiled at the other men and started to open the sitting room door. \u201cGuess this is my signal.\u201d</p><p>Startled silence.</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d Ranon asked, sitting up straighter in his chair.</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that duty wasn\u2019t required of a First Escort,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Theran shrugged. \u201cNot required, but it can be requested.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure about that. Wasn\u2019t sure if offering wasn\u2019t crossing some line according to those books of Protocol Cassidy had brought with her. But he figured a woman who hadn\u2019t gotten a ride for a few days wasn\u2019t going to turn down an offer, even if it wasn\u2019t strictly following the damn rules.</p><p>\u201cTheran,\u201d Ranon said, sounding concerned. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure about anything except that he had to do something to keep Gray safe. He smiled again. \u201cI can fulfill my duties to the Queen. When it comes right down to it, all women look the same in the dark.\u201d</p><p>A rustle of material outside the room, but no one was there when he opened the door.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. Had a maid been standing there eavesdropping? Didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>He took his time walking up to that wing of the house, but he still arrived at Cassidy\u2019s door much too soon. He knocked twice, and when she finally opened the door, he noticed that the spots on her face seemed to be popping out of her pale skin more than usual.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She just stared at him.</p><p>\u201cYou left your shawl down in the sitting room.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hoarsely spoken, as if she was fighting back some strong emotion.</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll women may look the same in the dark, but all men don\u2019t feel the same. In fact, a woman will find out more about a man\u2019s true nature in the dark than she\u2019ll ever see in the light of day.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. She was the one who had been standing outside the door. \u201cLook, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your penis, and I don\u2019t need your pity.\u201d</p><p>She slammed the door in his face, and a moment later he felt a Rose lock on the door.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Theran muttered. He folded the shawl and left it outside her door\u2014and wondered how much groveling he would have to do in the morning.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>All women look the same in the dark.</p><p>Did you really think I was excited about being with you? I worked damn hard in your bed, Cassidy, and thank the Darkness you never wanted a ride in daylight.</p><p>All women look the same in the dark.</p><p>Five years when you were all I could have. At least with Lady Kermilla I won\u2019t need a drug to keep myself hard in order to fulfill my duties.</p><p>All women look the same in the dark. All women. All women.</p><p>Dreams. Memories. Lashed by words spoken by her previous Consort on the day he left her court and by Theran last night, Cassidy headed for the gardens as soon as there was enough light. She couldn\u2019t stay in the house, couldn\u2019t breathe in the house.</p><p>It hurt to think, hurt to feel, hurt to remember.</p><p>Theran didn\u2019t want her, wasn\u2019t even supposed to make that kind of offer. A First Escort wasn\u2019t a Consort. She didn\u2019t want a Consort. Didn\u2019t want another man telling her she wasn\u2019t good enough, pretty enough, hot enough, arousing enough, whatever enough she wasn\u2019t, because she could only be who she was, and she didn\u2019t want to be hurt like that. Not ever again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And even now, when she should have been free of that kind of pain because no man here was required to warm her bed, Theran had shoved that truth in her face.</p><p>She was good enough when bedding her could be used to feed ambition or provide relief, but she would never be wanted for herself.</p><p>\u201cNo tools,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNeed tools.\u201d</p> <p>She entered the big stone shed as quietly as possible, but the clunk of shovels was enough to have Gray pulling aside the old blanket that served as a door to his room.</p><p>\u201cCassidy?\u201d</p><p>Couldn\u2019t talk to him now. Couldn\u2019t talk to anyone. \u201cGo back to sleep, Gray. It\u2019s early. I just needed to get some tools.\u201d Shovel, hoe, rake, short-handled claw.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to start weeding now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hard to hold all of them. Easier to vanish them and call them back in when she got to the bed where she planned to work. But she didn\u2019t want easier. Not today. Easier wouldn\u2019t help her run from the words.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Cassidy tried to hold back anger, hurt, all the feelings that wanted to lash out at someone, anyone. \u201cI need to work alone. You need to leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>She ran from the shed and stopped at a part of the garden that looked like it hadn\u2019t been touched in years. The ground here wasn\u2019t soft like the bed she\u2019d been working on with Gray. This ground would require muscle, sweat, even pain.</p><p>Nothing easy. Not here.</p><p>All women look the same in the dark.</p><p>Did you really think I was excited about being with you?</p> <p>She had to move. Had to. Work. Move. Keep moving. Don\u2019t think. Because if she let the words keep ripping at her heart, she\u2019d simply lie down and not get up again.</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>Lucivar closed the door of the sitting room, took a moment to get a feel for what kind of temper he was about to meet, and didn\u2019t like the answer. Didn\u2019t like it at all.</p><p>\u201cDraca told me you were here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Daemon turned away from the windows. \u201cI received the first report from Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she doing all right?\u201d</p><p>Daemon smiled dryly. \u201cHard to say. I think she was nervous about writing the report and was trying hard not to say anything negative, so it\u2019s a bit lean on information. However, she did say that her Master of the Guard is a Sapphire-Jeweled Warlord Prince who is demon-dead. Since yarbarah isn\u2019t a vintage known in Dena Nehele, she requested that some bottles be sent to her, paid for by the Queen\u2019s gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking care of those bills, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am. And since at least half of the yarbarah made in Kaeleer comes from our family\u2019s vineyards, I decided to deliver a couple of cases personally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean deliver them personally as far as the Keep here in Kaeleer. You can\u2019t go to Terreille.\u201d</p><p>Daemon stiffened. His eyes began to glaze. \u201cAre you giving me orders, Prick?\u201d he asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you I\u2019ll help you follow our Queen\u2019s command, even if that means we\u2019ll both need a Healer by the time the discussion is done.\u201d</p><p>Daemon looked away. \u201cDid Father tell you what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me dealing with Theran Grayhaven opened up some old wounds,\u201d Lucivar replied. Saetan had told him more than that, and what their father hadn\u2019t said he could guess.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you I attacked Jaenelle?\u201d</p><p>Mother Night. Lucivar blew out a breath, not sure how to answer that.</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you the Sadist was in bed with her?\u201d</p><p>Oh, now. That he knew how to deal with. \u201cThe way I heard it, Daemon attacked Jaenelle while caught in an old, bad memory, and the Sadist enjoyed a snuggle that included a lot of moaning and several climaxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, he\u2019s fragile.</p><p>\u201cThe Sadist uses sex as a weapon,\u201d Lucivar said, \u201cbut the Sadist rises out of temper, not desire. Usually.\u201d</p><p>Daemon swayed\u2014and Lucivar had the queer sense of circling around a memory . . . about another time and place when Daemon had come to him, already mentally fragile, and he had lashed out with words that had created a wound that would never fully heal. Even now.</p><p>\u201cOld son, Daemon makes love to Jaenelle, but the Sadist dances with Witch,\u201d Lucivar said gently. \u201cNot out of hate or temper; he dances with her out of desire. But this time, for whatever reason, she didn\u2019t make that transition with you\u2014and it scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTch. You scare the shit out of me when you\u2019re the Sadist. But you don\u2019t scare her. You don\u2019t scare Jaenelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did scare her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, not as much as you think. And I figure scaring her once in a while helps her remember what you\u2019re feeling when she does something that scares you. Which, you have to admit, she does on a regular basis.\u201d</p><p>Daemon\u2019s response was a brief, reluctant smile to acknowledge that particular truth. Then the smile faded. \u201cHave you ever ... ?\u201d</p><p>Pain there. Fear there. And too damn close to one of those emotional scars that created a line Daemon couldn\u2019t cross anymore. Not without paying too high a price.</p><p>\u201cJust say it,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever feel possessive about Marian?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar sat back on air, as if he were sitting on a stool. \u201cMost of the time, I think of myself as Marian\u2019s husband, or I think of her as an independent woman who lives with me and is the mother of my son. But when Marian and I first became lovers, she moved into my bedroom\u2014and into my bed. So there\u2019s not a night that goes by that I\u2019m not saying \u2018Mine.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Daemon turned to look at him. Lucivar couldn\u2019t tell what was going on in his brother\u2019s mind or heart, but he knew what he said here and now would matter. Really matter. So he took a moment to choose his words.</p><p>\u201cMarian comes to my bed every night, but some nights it feels different. Occasionally I\u2019m in bed before her, and when I see her walking toward the bed, watch her get into bed, I feel . . . different. I don\u2019t have the words for it, Daemon. I just feel different. More . . . dangerous. It\u2019s not like the rut. When this happens, I\u2019m still there. My brain is still there. But something changes inside me, and I don\u2019t see her the same way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what she sees in my face, in my eyes. Sometimes when she gets into bed, she\u2019s nervous but excited. Aroused. And sometimes she\u2019s scared. Of me. Of whatever I am when that feeling fills me.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met. Held.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Daemon asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOn the nights when she\u2019s nervous and excited, the sex is . . . more. It has a flavor it doesn\u2019t have any other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd on the other nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kiss her once, because I need to. And I\u2019ll hold her while she sleeps. But I won\u2019t have sex with her. Even if I\u2019m ready to burst and she says she\u2019s willing, I won\u2019t have sex with her when I can smell her fear.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar took a breath and blew it out. Not an easy thing to talk about, even with a brother he loved.</p><p>Not something he\u2019d ever admitted to anyone before.</p><p>\u201cWant some advice?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome night soon, when nothing is riding you, when you\u2019re feeling easy, invite Jaenelle to your bed. To the bed that\u2019s yours, not hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo prove that the Sadist won\u2019t always be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No, Daemon, the Sadist will rise in a heartbeat to defend your most private bit of territory. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll hurt Jaenelle. He\u2019ll play games. That\u2019s what he does. But he won\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p><p>He felt a change inside Daemon, pieces that would never be completely whole settling back into place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the yarbarah to Dena Nehele,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to get a look around, and this is a good excuse. And I\u2019d like to get a look at this demon-dead Warlord Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means you won\u2019t be back until later tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I get back to the Keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Anything I can do here?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar gave Daemon a lazy, arrogant smile. \u201cYou feeling brave?\u201d</p><p>Daemon groaned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s market day. I was going to entertain the little beast for a couple of hours so Marian could go down to Riada alone.\u201d</p><p>Daemon groaned louder, but this groan sounded less sincere.</p><p>\u201cFine. All right,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cFor Marian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Daemon laughed, and the sound had Lucivar breathing easy again.</p><p>\u201cWill you be all right going to Terreille?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Daemon hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019ll shield?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar vanished the two boxes of yarbarah. \u201cOf course. I have to set a good example.\u201d Slipping the hunting knife out of its sheath, he studied the blade for a moment before deciding it was a sufficient weapon to wear openly. \u201cIs Surreal still pissed off at me for chewing on her because she didn\u2019t shield before she went into that spooky house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t automatically swear anymore when she hears your name, so I think she\u2019s getting over it.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar grinned. \u201cIn that case, it\u2019s time to get some other woman riled up.\u201d</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>She had to move. Had to work. Move. Work. Keep moving.</p><p>Whenever she stopped for a moment, her hands throbbed in time with her heart, and she knew that wasn\u2019t good. But the words were there, waiting to cut, jab, tear. The pain in her back, arms, shoulders, and hands kept the words at bay. Formed a wall that the other hurt couldn\u2019t breach.</p><p>So she kept working, kept moving, kept the words at bay.</p><p>\u201cHow long can she keep that up?\u201d Ranon asked, sounding worried.</p><p>Theran shook his head as he watched Cassidy. As they all watched Cassidy. Since early this morning, the First Circle had been gathering on the terrace to watch their Queen tear into the gardens. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So she got up feeling pissy. If she hadn\u2019t been eavesdropping, she would have had a good ride last night and would have been feeling just fine this morning.</p><p>But she was out there digging in that damn garden so everyone would know little Cassidy was feeling pouty.</p><p>She\u2019d snapped at Ranon when he\u2019d gone out to talk to her, told him flat out to leave her alone. And when he, Theran, had approached her, she had screamed at him. Screamed. Scared Gray so much the boy had been hovering around the terrace ever since.</p> <p>She\u2019ll stop when she gets tired of playing the wounded party, Theran thought. Hell\u2019s fire, it\u2019s not like I actually did anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell is going on here?\u201d</p><p>Theran spun around and stared at the Red-Jeweled Eyrien standing in the doorway. A Warlord Prince whose glazed gold eyes were a warning that the man was standing close to the killing edge, if he wasn\u2019t already dancing on it.</p><p>Ranon shifted into a fighting stance.</p><p>The Eyrien stepped out on the terrace, ignoring Ranon, his eyes fixed on Cassidy.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to start a pissing contest with me,\u201d the Eyrien said to Ranon. \u201cYou really don\u2019t.\u201d He turned his head, and Theran felt the punch of power as those gold eyes stared at him.</p><p>He was looking at death. This man was a stranger who had walked into his home and should be challenged, but he knew, with absolute certainty, that he was looking at death.</p><p>Then the Eyrien fixed his eyes on Gray. \u201cYou do anything to piss her off?\u201d he asked mildly.</p><p>Gray shook his head.</p><p>\u201cThen get me two large buckets of cold water, and put them over there.\u201d He pointed to a spot near the stairs leading down to the lawn. \u201cDo it now.\u201d</p><p>Gray bolted.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat you should have done,\u201d the Eyrien replied. \u201cTake care of your Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ordered us to leave her alone,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>The Eyrien snorted. \u201cAnd you let her get away with that? Well, she knows better than to say that to me.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Gray returned with the buckets of water, the Eyrien headed for Cassidy. When he got close to her, he whistled sharply.</p><p>Her head came up\u2014and the hoe came up like a weapon. The Eyrien simply grabbed the wood between her hands and tugged. She yanked back. He tugged. Then he yanked, lifting her off her feet for a moment before he turned and walked back to the terrace, dragging her with him.</p><p>Her feet kept trying to find purchase, but she skimmed along the top of the grass while the Eyrien ignored her increasingly shrill demands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my hoe!\u201d Cassidy yelled, still fighting the Eyrien as he yanked her up high enough to clear the terrace steps. \u201cLet go! It\u2019s mine!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d The Eyrien set her down in front of the buckets.</p><p>\u201cMine!\u201d</p><p>A fast twist of his wrist, and the length of the hoe handle between Cassidy\u2019s hands snapped off cleanly. He tossed it off the terrace.</p><p>\u201cYou broke my hoe!\u201d Cassidy wailed. \u201cYou broke my hoe!\u201d</p><p>As she threw down the broken pieces, the buckets rose up behind her and doused her with cold water.</p><p>Her shriek had all of them jumping back. Except the Eyrien.</p><p>\u201cHave I got your attention now, witchling?\u201d the Eyrien asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Cassidy blinked. Stared at the man.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d Her eyes skipped over Theran and settled on Ranon and the others before coming back to the Eyrien.</p><p>\u201cListen up, Cassie, because I\u2019ll only tell you this once,\u201d the Eyrien said. \u201cIf you have a problem with your court, you deal with your court. And if they end up with a few bruises because of it, so be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Queen doesn\u2019t do that to her court,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>The Eyrien grabbed her wrists and turned her hands palms up. \u201cAnd a woman doesn\u2019t do this to herself.\u201d</p><p>Theran looked at Cassidy\u2019s hands and felt his stomach roll. How could she have done that? Why didn\u2019t she stop?</p><p>She looked at her hands\u2014and grew pale.</p><p>\u201cYou ever do anything like this again, I\u2019ll haul you back to Kaeleer,\u201d the Eyrien said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bury anyone who tries to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do anything like this again, I will haul you back to Kaeleer, and you can explain to your father why you did this to his daughter.\u201d</p><p>Kick in the gut. Her lower lip quivered. Her eyes filled with tears. The damn Eyrien knew right where to hit her to take all the fight out of her.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a Healer?\u201d the Eyrien asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cThen you call her, and you get those hands fixed. I\u2019ll look in on you in a little while. We\u2019ve got some things to talk about.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled a little when she headed for the door, and she flinched away from him when Theran reached out to give her a little support through the doorway.</p><p>He waited until he was sure she was out of sight and hearing before he looked at the Eyrien. \u201cWho do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His back slammed into the house. The Eyrien\u2019s forearm pressed against his chest, holding him in place.</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. He hadn\u2019t even seen the man move.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason a woman does that to herself is because she\u2019s running from pain that hurts a lot more,\u201d the Eyrien snarled. \u201cAnd in my experience, the source of that kind of pain is usually attached to a cock. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re the reason she was out there this morning. Whatever the problem is, you\u2019d better fix it. Because if I ever find her in that shape again, boyo, I will skin you alive.\u201d</p><p>The Eyrien stepped back. Theran sagged against the wall.</p><p>The Eyrien looked at Ranon, who stiffened but offered no challenge. \u201cDoes the Master of the Guard live in this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ranon replied. \u201cBut he\u2019s not available until sundown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of that. I have a delivery for him. And a few things to discuss.\u201d</p><p>The Eyrien walked into the house. No one asked him where he was going.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Ranon said. Then he looked at Theran. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBruises. Nothing more.\u201d Except he had looked at death.</p><p>The Eyrien wasn\u2019t bluffing about skinning him alive.</p><p>Cassidy walked into the healing room Shira had set up in the wing that held the working rooms for the court.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Shira said. \u201cRanon keeps calling me on a psychic thread, telling me to get to the healing room as fast as I can, and I\u2019ve never heard him sound so nervous. What\u2019s . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy held out her hands.</p><p>\u201cMother Night!\u201d</p><p>Shira hurried around the table where she mixed her tonics and healing brews. Her hands hovered around Cassidy\u2019s but didn\u2019t touch.</p><p>Cassidy kept her eyes fixed on a spot over Shira\u2019s left shoulder. \u201cCan you fix them?\u201d</p><p>Shira let out a quivering sigh. \u201cI think so. It\u2019s going to take a while just to clean them out and see how bad it really is, but I think so.\u201d She led Cassidy to a chair at one end of the table.</p><p>Cassidy sat quietly, cocooned in pain. She didn\u2019t pay attention as Shira hustled around the healing room, gathering supplies and starting a series of different brews to cleanse and heal. But she did look over when Shira placed a basin on the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Shira gave her a long look. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be easy, and I\u2019m thinking one or both of us is going to need to puke in that basin before this is done.\u201d</p><p>Gray followed the Eyrien who had dared to dump cold water over Cassie. Who had yelled at Cassie.</p><p>Bastard.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t Theran or Ranon say anything? Why did they let him do that?</p><p>The bastard had no right. He\u2014\u201chad no right!\u201d</p><p>The Eyrien stopped and turned his head just enough to indicate he knew someone was behind him. Had probably known all along.</p><p>The man was power and temper like he\u2019d never felt before, but he would have his say.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s our Queen!\u201d Gray shouted. \u201cOurs! You had no right to be scolding her or getting her wet.\u201d</p><p>The Eyrien turned to look at him. \u201cYour Queen,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you stop her?\u201d</p><p>His eyes filled with frustrated tears. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let me. She ordered me to stay away, to leave her alone. And she got hurt.\u201d His shoulders sagged. \u201cShe got hurt.\u201d</p><p>The Eyrien took a step closer. \u201cThe first law is not obedience. The first law is to honor, cherish, and protect. The second is to serve. The third is to obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you don\u2019t obey, you get punished.\u201d</p><p>The Eyrien studied him. \u201cEverything has a price. You take a chance of being punished, even killed, for challenging a Queen even if you\u2019re doing it to protect her, but you accept that risk and do what you should. If the Queen is truly worthy of your loyalty, she\u2019ll understand the reason for the challenge and back down. Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll like it or be happy with the man, but she\u2019ll back down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told everyone to leave her alone.\u201d It had been so painful to watch her, to know she was hurting and not be able to stop her.</p><p>\u201cSomeone hurt her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Gray felt something in him stir. \u201cWho hurt Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s healthier for everyone,\u201d the Eyrien said. \u201cI do know she was hurting before she went out into the garden, and she was trying to sweat out some of the hurt and temper. Her First Escort should have given her an hour; then he should have used Protocol to stop her. And if that didn\u2019t work, he should have fought her into the ground.\u201d</p><p>Gray frowned. \u201cProtocol? But those are just words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And one sentence that used the right words could have stopped this.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gotten a glimpse of Cassie\u2019s hands. One sentence could have stopped that? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Eyrien made a sound. Annoyance? Disgust? \u201cThis court is supposed to be learning the Old Ways. I know Lady Cassidy brought books of Protocol with her. Haven\u2019t any of you looked at them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know.\u201d Gray rubbed his nose with the back of his hand. \u201cIf I had said the sentence, she would have stopped before she got hurt?\u201d</p><p>It was the way the Eyrien looked at him that made Gray wonder what the man saw.</p> <p>\u201cA Queen doesn\u2019t like having a man set his heels down and get ready to fight her about something, so if you use Protocol to stop her, she\u2019ll probably swear at you. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? She\u2019ll swear at me?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t like it, but that didn\u2019t sound so bad. \u201cWill she hit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends on the woman. I\u2019ve gotten slugged in the arm more than once because I annoyed a witch who needed to be protected from herself.\u201d The Eyrien shrugged. \u201cI can take a bruised muscle a lot easier than I can take watching someone I care about get hurt.\u201d</p><p>If he learned the Protocol, then . . .</p><p>Gray looked around and realized where he was. He\u2019d been so focused on catching up to the Eyrien and yelling at the man for dumping water on Cassie, he hadn\u2019t paid attention.</p> <p>\u201cNothing is going to come at you,\u201d the Eyrien said,\u201cbecause there is nothing here that can get past me.\u201d</p><p>He knew. Somehow this stranger knew.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Gray whispered. He wanted to curl up and hide, wanted to run.</p><p>\u201cLucivar. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray.\u201d His body shook with the effort to stand there and not run, not hide, not scream out the old fear until his voice was gone.</p><p>The other Queen never stopped the pain until his voice was gone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not . . . right,\u201d Gray said. That was the reason he couldn\u2019t serve in the court. Talon and Theran had both told him that. Not that he\u2019d wanted to serve in the court. At least, not until he\u2019d met Cassie.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Lucivar said quietly. \u201cYou have scars, Gray, and they run deep. I can feel them in you. When a man has scars like that, there are boundaries he can\u2019t cross, lines he has to draw to keep himself whole. But those boundaries aren\u2019t as small as you might think, and a man can choose to live safe or he can choose to live right up to those lines. He might slip over a line every now and then, and that will hurt like a wicked bitch, but he might decide that what he gains will be worth the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have scars?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>Lucivar nodded. \u201cI have scars. And sometimes they still bleed.\u201d</p><p>Gray studied Lucivar. This man didn\u2019t know him, didn\u2019t know about the times when he was so scared he couldn\u2019t take care of himself, when his body seized up so badly he couldn\u2019t move. And yet there was a message underneath the words, a message that had been there since Lucivar had first turned and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a warrior,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you are.\u201d Lucivar smiled grimly. \u201cJust because you fought on a different kind of battlefield doesn\u2019t make you less a warrior.\u201d</p><p>Something stirred, shifted, fit into place.</p> <p>\u201cYou get a copy of those books of Protocol and you study them,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cNext time you won\u2019t have to stand back if Cassidy does something foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first law is not obedience,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Lucivar grinned. \u201cThat was the best rule I ever learned.\u201d</p><p>Gray grinned in reply. Then the grin faded as he looked at the walls that seemed to be closing in around him.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to walk you out of here?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>Gray hesitated. \u201cCan those boundaries you talked about change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp to a point. The challenge is to learn which ones are still fluid and which ones are made of stone. I\u2019m guessing you entered what had been the enemy\u2019s lair. That\u2019s pushing the boundaries plenty for one day.\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded. Then he pointed to a door on the right. \u201cThat room has the fastest way out from here. Not a door, just a window, but there\u2019s nothing in the way under it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>When Gray had the window open and one leg over the sill, he realized what was missing from Lucivar\u2019s psychic scent that was there in all the other Warlord Princes\u2019 scents. Even Theran\u2019s and Talon\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t pity me,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Lucivar gave him one of those long, assessing looks. \u201cA lot of us have scars, boyo. The biggest difference between you and the rest of us is you haven\u2019t learned to live with yours yet.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Talon waited in the small meeting room. As Master of the Guard, he didn\u2019t have an office like the Steward\u2014and didn\u2019t want one\u2014but this small room was becoming his place to talk with one or two of the men when he had specific instructions or one of them wanted to report something in private. Not that there had been much to report.</p><p>He had a bad feeling that was about to change.</p><p>Didn\u2019t need to be told they were in trouble. He\u2019d felt that dark presence the moment he woke; known a strong predator had come to the estate. And Powell had knocked on his door a minute after sunset to tell him an Eyrien was waiting to see him. A Red-Jeweled Warlord Prince.</p><p>\u201cRed-Jeweled, my ass,\u201d Talon muttered. He wore Sapphire. He knew the feel of Red. And he was willing to bet that if the Eyrien wore the Red, it wasn\u2019t his Jewel of rank. Which meant the Eyrien had to be . . .</p><p>The door opened and controlled fury walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cLucivar Yaslana,\u201d Talon whispered, feeling his legs go weak. He\u2019d never met the man before, thank the Darkness, but there was no mistaking the Ebon-gray Jewel that gleamed against Lucivar\u2019s brown skin. \u201cI\u2019m Talon, Master of the Guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I am?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>Talon nodded. He\u2019d heard enough stories to know exactly what was standing in this room.</p><p>Lucivar raised one hand. Two boxes appeared on the table. He approached the table and pulled the top off one box. \u201cOfficial business first. This is yarbarah, the blood wine.\u201d</p><p>With no wasted movement, Lucivar opened a bottle of yarbarah, called in a wineglass, filled it, and began warming the blood wine over a tongue of witchfire.</p><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re going to need to keep replenishing your power, you should drink a glass of this three times a day. More if you want, but three glasses will provide enough blood to maintain someone who is demon-dead. Every ten days, you should add some fresh human blood. How much depends on the strength of the person who is giving it, but a couple of spoonfuls is usually enough. And once a month you should drink an offering cup of undiluted human blood.\u201d Lucivar handed the glass to Talon. \u201cYarbarah is best drunk warm. It tastes a little thick otherwise. And it\u2019s best to keep a bottle chilled once you open it.\u201d</p><p>Talon took the wineglass but didn\u2019t drink. \u201cThe court can\u2019t afford the expense of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen\u2019s gift. Won\u2019t cost the court anything to keep you supplied with what you need to serve as Master.\u201d</p><p>Someone\u2019s paying for it, Talon thought, but he didn\u2019t argue. And he didn\u2019t try to resist any longer when the smell of blood was sharpening his hunger and need.</p><p>He took a sip, got the taste of it, then gulped down the rest of the glass. Not as rich or potent as human blood, but there wasn\u2019t any shame in drinking it.</p><p>\u201cThere are specific rituals for the giving and taking of blood,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cYou should learn them.\u201d</p><p>Talon hesitated, then filled the glass again and warmed it with witchfire the way Lucivar had done.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you know so much about yarbarah?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMy uncle, cousin, and older brother were demon-dead. My father is a Guardian. Yarbarah is standard fare with the family.\u201d</p><p>Talon took another swallow of yarbarah and frowned. \u201cThey were demon-dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your father is . . . ?\u201d According to some stories,Yaslana was a half-breed bastard whose bloodlines were unknown. According to other stories, Daemon Sadi shared that unknown paternal bloodline, making Sadi and Yaslana half brothers.</p><p>\u201cA Guardian,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cOne of the living dead. And the High Lord of Hell.\u201d</p><p>Ice twined around Talon\u2019s spine. Saetan had sired Sadi and Yaslana? Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful!</p><p>That explained some things about the two of them. And it made Talon wonder if going to Sadi for a favor hadn\u2019t been a serious mistake if his brother was also going to take an interest in Dena Nehele.</p><p>And his father as well? That wasn\u2019t a thought Talon wanted to entertain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your unofficial business?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>Lucivar\u2019s gold eyes glazed. \u201cI don\u2019t like what I see here,Talon. I don\u2019t like what I feel here. If it doesn\u2019t change, I\u2019m taking Cassidy back to Kaeleer, and I\u2019ll leave nothing but corpses behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to make that decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say I do. Your Queen got hurt today, and not one of her court did a damn thing to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt? How? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk the First Circle. Ask the First Escort, who\u2019s lucky to still be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Talon asked again.</p><p>\u201cI figured it was better for everyone if I didn\u2019t ask for the details.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire.</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right. Even if Yaslana was here because Sadi had asked his brother to play messenger, Lucivar\u2019s interest in Cassidy seemed a bit too proprietary.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your interest in a Rose-Jeweled Queen?\u201d Talon asked. He\u2019d tried to put it aside because Cassidy seemed a likable enough girl\u2014and because there was something about her that pulled at him and pulled hard\u2014but the truth was they needed strength and had gotten weakness.</p><p>Lucivar tipped his head, and his expression changed to cold amusement. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? Your boy Grayhaven didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Jewels a Queen wears are not the only kind of power she wields. You should know that well enough. How many of the Queens you endured over these past few decades would have ruled at all if they hadn\u2019t been backed by that bitch Dorothea SaDiablo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Talon said bitterly. \u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with the here and now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConnections, Prince. You looked at Cassidy\u2019s Jewels and forgot to consider the connections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat connections?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why Cassidy is here?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause Sadi\u2019s wife is a friend of hers, and Theran\u2019s choice was to take Cassidy or walk away without a Queen,\u201d Talon snapped, frustrated enough to be imprudent.</p><p>\u201cSadi\u2019s wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Queen who doesn\u2019t seem able to form a court of her own, even with Sadi\u2019s backing.\u201d</p><p>The room suddenly turned cold enough to bite.</p><p>\u201cYour boy left out a few things,\u201d Lucivar said too softly. \u201cBecause of that, I\u2019ll overlook your lack of courtesy. This time. Since Grayhaven has chosen to leave out a few details\u2014or didn\u2019t care enough to ask\u2014you would do well to ask Cassidy a few questions. Like who really sent her to Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>The cold was turning his muscles to stone. He wouldn\u2019t be able to move fast enough to avoid an attack. Wouldn\u2019t survive an attack even if he could move.</p><p>Killing field. Battlefield. Didn\u2019t matter. Any man who fought knew that no one on the opposing side survived when Yaslana stepped into a fight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back, Talon,\u201d Lucivar said as he turned toward the door. \u201cYou can count on it. And the next time I won\u2019t be as forgiving. You can count on that too.\u201d</p> <p>Lucivar opened the door, then stopped and looked back. \u201cThe Warlord Prince Gray.\u201d</p><p>Talon swallowed hard. Mother Night! How would a defense-less boy like Gray handle crossing paths with something like Yaslana? \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old was he when he was tortured?\u201d</p><p>Talon rocked back on his heels, not sure what to think. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar snorted. \u201cI\u2019ve lived seventeen hundred years. I\u2019ve seen a lot of courts and a lot of men during that time. I know the look, and I know the feel, of a man who\u2019s been tortured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen,\u201d Talon said. \u201cHe was fifteen years old and the most promising Warlord Prince to come along in a couple generations or more. Not as good with weapons as Theran, but stronger in other ways. He could have been stronger.\u201d He sighed, feeling the old regrets. \u201cWasn\u2019t much left of that promising boy two years later when I finally found him and got him away from the bitch.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar just looked at him for a long time. \u201cAsk the questions, Prince,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAsk the questions before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Talon waited until Lucivar left the room before he drained the second glass of yarbarah. Then he corked the bottle and put a cooling spell on it. He wanted more, needed more blood, since he\u2019d resisted asking for any\u2014or demanding any\u2014from the Warlord Princes in the court since the night Cassidy had freely given her blood.</p> <p>\u201cToo many warnings and not enough information,\u201d Talon growled.</p><p>When he opened the door, he found Ranon on the other side.</p><p>\u201cI came to tell you the Eyrien is gone,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d Talon snapped.</p><p>Ranon came into the room, wary.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the name of Hell happened today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much trouble we\u2019re in, so don\u2019t be playing games with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><p>Frustration. Worry. Ranon wasn\u2019t trying to hide those things.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what you do know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI respectfully refuse to give you a shovel. Or a hoe. Or a rake. Or any of the tools. I Craft-locked the shed.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy slanted a look at Gray, who had crept up to the flower bed and now stood a long step away from her.</p><p>Her hands throbbed whenever she lowered them. Her arms ached when she held her hands up. She shouldn\u2019t even be out there. She should be in her room, resting. She\u2019d slept for a little while after Shira finished the healing and helped her to her suite, but she didn\u2019t feel easy about being inside the house. At least out here, there was the illusion of comfort.</p><p>Then the phrasing Gray used sank in and had her looking at him more closely\u2014and had her eyeing the book he clutched to his chest like a shield.</p><p>\u201cIs that one of the books of Protocol I brought?\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded. \u201cIf I\u2019d studied the book before, I could have stopped you from getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you to stay away,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cYou obeyed my orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first law is not obedience. Lucivar said so.\u201d</p><p>Thank you very much, Lucivar. Even if he was an adult, Gray was still an impressionable young man, and LucivarYaslana could certainly leave an impression.</p><p>\u201cHow much time did you spend with Lucivar?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d</p><p>Long enough. There was a look in Gray\u2019s eyes that hadn\u2019t been there yesterday.</p><p>\u201cYou can swear at me if you want,\u201d Gray said with complete sincerity. \u201cYou can swear at me because I won\u2019t let you have any tools.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Cassidy appreciated the lessons in maintaining a dignified expression and a steady voice.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gray, but I don\u2019t feel like swearing right now. I\u2019ll take you up on that offer another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He sidled up until he was standing right next to her. Until his shoulder brushed against hers.</p><p>Not wanting to wonder why he was standing that close, she stared at the flower bed. And frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou cleaned it up, didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou kept digging them up, but you stopped tossing the weeds out. Stopped picking up the rocks and tossing them out too.\u201d He paused, then added softly,\u201cSome of the rocks have your blood smeared on them.\u201d</p><p>She felt sick. She hadn\u2019t noticed the blood.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Gray said, giving her a light nudge as he pointed to the boulder she\u2019d been digging around when Lucivar hauled her out of the garden. \u201cWhat do you think? Should the rock stay, or should it go?\u201d</p><p>Talon walked toward the back of the garden as fast as his limping gait allowed.</p><p>Connections. Yes, he knew about connections. But he hadn\u2019t read the signs right this time. Hadn\u2019t made the effort he should have over these past few days to find out more about the Queen who now ruled Dena Nehele. He had been disappointed by Cassidy\u2019s lack of strength, hadn\u2019t questioned Theran\u2019s unhappiness that the one favor he could use hadn\u2019t netted something better.</p><p>Until today, he\u2019d thought the connection had been between Sadi and Theran, because of Jared. Now he understood: Jared\u2019s bloodline had gotten Theran an audience and nothing more. The only reason they had a Queen at all was Cassidy\u2019s connection to Sadi and Yaslana.</p><p>And he\u2019d damn well better find out why two of the darkest-Jeweled males in the history of the Blood were taking such a keen interest in a Rose-Jeweled Queen they didn\u2019t serve.</p><p>Gray noticed him first, and even in the dusky light,Talon saw the queer look in the boy\u2019s eyes. In another Warlord Prince, he would have called that look a challenge. Then it was gone, and he pushed aside the thought.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>\u201cPrince Talon,\u201d Cassidy replied.</p><p>\u201cGray, you should go on and get some supper,\u201d Talon said.</p><p>Gray didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cThat was Prince Talon\u2019s subtle way of telling you he wants to talk to me alone,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to talk to him?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>Talon felt as if he\u2019d stepped on ice but didn\u2019t quite lose his footing.</p><p>What in the name of Hell happened to Gray today?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Cassidy said, nudging Gray with an elbow. \u201cI should go back inside beforeVae comes out to find me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll wear your hat tomorrow,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear my hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t pick up tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t pick up tools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to swear at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Gray grinned, nothing more than a boy again. Then he headed for the stables, where the men would have some food for him.</p><p>Alone with her, Talon wondered how to ask the questions that needed asking.</p><p>It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve been around a Queen. Maybe too long.</p><p>\u201cI heard there was some trouble today,\u201d Talon said, looking at her hands. They were bandaged so thickly he wondered if she had any use of them.</p><p>Cassidy shrugged and stared at the dug-up flower bed she could barely see.</p><p>\u201cAre your hands going to be all right?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cShira says I didn\u2019t do any permanent damage. I\u2019ll just have to be careful for a while because they\u2019ll be tender.\u201d</p><p>Talon nodded. \u201cYou want to tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He tapped a finger against his chest. \u201cMaster of the Guard, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . personal.\u201d</p><p>Personal. Theran wasn\u2019t stupid. He wouldn\u2019t have gone up to her room last night without an invitation. Would he?</p><p>\u201cDid Theran . . . ?\u201d He looked away. He didn\u2019t want to say the words, but he couldn\u2019t dismiss the depth of Yaslana\u2019s fury\u2014especially when that fury seemed mostly aimed at Theran. \u201cDid he do something he shouldn\u2019t have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He heard the lie, but he couldn\u2019t call her on it. Even as her Master of the Guard, he couldn\u2019t call her on the lie. But he could\u2014and would\u2014talk to Shira and find out if Cassidy had any other injuries. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t think Shira would tell him anything ugly\u2014mostly because he was certain Yaslana wouldn\u2019t have let Theran live if the harm the boy had done to Cassidy had been physical.</p><p>\u201cI heard Yaslana dumped a couple buckets of water on you,\u201d Talon said. \u201cNot exactly a courteous thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked at him, clearly surprised\u2014and relieved\u2014that he wasn\u2019t demanding an explanation of what had ridden her so hard she hadn\u2019t noticed the damage she was doing to herself. \u201cOh. Well. That\u2019s Lucivar. He used to do that to everyone. When he was annoyed with his sister, he used to toss her into the pond, and she was the Queen he served.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did you get to know someone like Yaslana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin Aaron served in the Dark Court\u2019s First Circle, and Lucivar was the First Escort. Before the court formed officially, apprenticeships were offered to give some people an opportunity to work with darker-Jeweled witches and Warlord Princes and to study Protocol with the High Lord.\u201d</p><p>Talon\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cYou learned Protocol from the High Lord of Hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraining in Protocol starts after a child\u2019s Birthright Ceremony and continues all through schooling. The High Lord\u2019s lessons were more about dealing with darker-Jeweled males and also the Protocols used when the living had contact with the demon-dead. And Jaenelle said trying to deal with Lucivar was an experience a Queen should have at least once.\u201d</p><p>So Sadi\u2019s wife had been there too.</p> <p>\u201cWhere was this dark court located?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked puzzled. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed like there was at least one court in every Territory that was referring to itself as a dark court,\u201d Talon said. \u201cI was just wondering where the one you mentioned was located.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Kaeleer, there was only one that was referred to as the Dark Court,\u201d Cassidy said slowly. \u201cThat was the court at Ebon Askavi.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cWith that kind of credentials, why doesn\u2019t Sadi\u2019s wife have a court?\u201d Talon asked, but he was more wondering out loud than expecting an answer.</p> <p>\u201cAfter she recovered from her injuries, she didn\u2019t want to rule anymore,\u201d Cassidy said, \u201cand everyone was so glad she survived, they didn\u2019t care if there was an official court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was injured?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years ago. It was several months before anyone knew for sure that she survived, and several more before she was fully healed.\u201d</p><p>Two years ago. Two years ago.</p><p>\u201cShe got caught in that storm of power the Kaeleer army unleashed?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy frowned at him. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t an army. That was Jaenelle. She unleashed her full strength and cleansed all three Realms of the Blood tainted by that bad High Priestess.\u201d</p><p>Talon swayed. He had felt that power when it screamed through Terreille two years ago. Had felt the bite of it before it let him go, passed him by.</p><p>One witch had unleashed that much power? One?</p> <p>He stared at Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Theran tell you?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore she was injured, Jaenelle was the Queen of Ebon Askavi.\u201d</p><p>Theran paced the length of the larger meeting room, shooting looks at Ranon every time he passed that end of the table.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure Talon said to meet him here?\u201d</p><p>Ranon gave him a cold stare. \u201cI\u2019m sure. He said to give him an hour, and then he wanted to meet with the whole First Circle. Guess he got delayed.\u201d</p><p>By what? Theran wondered.</p><p>When Talon walked in a few minutes later, he knew something was terribly wrong, because he\u2019d never seen the older man look so shaken\u2014or scared.</p><p>\u201cYou young fool,\u201d Talon said, heading right for him. \u201cWhat did you do? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>Talon grabbed Theran by the shirt and shook him before giving him a shove that had him half falling on the men sitting around the table.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Theran snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou want to think for a minute and try the answer again?\u201d Talon roared.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. Do. Anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forgot a few details, boy. The kind of details that could destroy all of us\u2014and Dena Nehele as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnections,Theran. Connections.\u201d</p><p>Talon sagged suddenly, and that was more frightening than his anger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just as much to blame,\u201d Talon said quietly. \u201cDidn\u2019t look closely enough. Didn\u2019t think to ask until it was shoved in my face that I hadn\u2019t asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalon,\u201d Powell said. \u201cIt would help the rest of us understand the danger if you could be a little less vague.\u201d</p><p>Theran eased around to the other side of the table but didn\u2019t take a seat. What sort of tale was Cassidy telling that would get Talon that pissed off at him?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got Lucivar Yaslana\u2014yes, that\u2019s who that Eyrien was\u2014honing his weapons and looking in our direction. Which means Sadi is also going to be looking in our direction and honing his own brand of weapons. And don\u2019t think for a minute that Yaslana isn\u2019t going to report to his father\u2014who happens to be the High Lord of Hell.\u201d</p><p>Some of the men sucked in a breath. Others groaned.</p><p>\u201cAnd worst of all,\u201d Talon said grimly, \u201cI don\u2019t think Lady Cassidy\u2019s friend is going to be looking kindly at us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriend?\u201d Ranon said, glancing at Theran. \u201cYou mean Sadi\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>Talon looked at Theran, and there was a bleakness in the older man\u2019s eyes that made Theran shudder.</p><p>\u201cSadi\u2019s wife,\u201d Talon said softly. \u201cWho was the Queen of Ebon Askavi.\u201d</p><p>Shocked silence.</p><p>\u201cWitch,\u201d Talon continued, \u201cchose Cassidy to be our Queen. So we\u2019d all better start looking beyond a Rose Jewel to figure out why. Gentlemen, we\u2019ve already made one bad mistake. We can\u2019t afford to make another. So we\u2019re going to study those books of Protocol, and we\u2019re going to learn what we said we wanted to learn. And if the Darkness is merciful, the next time Lucivar Yaslana shows up here, he won\u2019t invite all of us to step onto a killing field.\u201d</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>Lucivar stepped into the sitting room and stopped. He\u2019d expected to find his father waiting for him, but . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat are you still doing here?\u201d he asked Daemon as he approached a low table filled with different kinds of edibles.</p><p>\u201cWaiting for you.\u201d Daemon put a thin slice of cheese on top of a triangle of toast and added a spoonful of chopped spicy beef.</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d Saetan asked, indicating the open bottle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather have ale,\u201d Lucivar said as he took the remaining seat around the table.</p><p>Saetan smiled dryly. \u201cI thought as much. That\u2019s why there\u2019s some on the way.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar filled a plate while he considered the other two men. Saetan was . . . Amused was the politest word that came to mind. Daemon was definitely grumpy.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d Lucivar asked, watching his brother.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still here because you were waiting for me?\u201d</p><p>Daemon made an inarticulate sound.</p><p>Saetan said, \u201cHe\u2019s trying to figure out how to explain a certain bit of Craft to his wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>Daemon was paying an awful lot of attention to making little sandwiches he wasn\u2019t eating.</p><p>\u201cMarian is pretty sure she can clean the paint off the floor,\u201d Daemon muttered. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Daemon huffed out a sigh. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that little beast ever get tired?\u201d</p><p>Saetan had an arm wrapped around his belly and his other fist pressed against his lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, Bastard. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made the mistake of falling asleep,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Daemon growled. \u201cI just thought . . . Something quiet. Just for a little while. We were sitting on the floor with sheets of sketching paper. They were big sheets. Why couldn\u2019t he keep the paint on the paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have been better if Daemon had thought to provide watercolors instead of a different kind of paint,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cAnd who in the name of Hell taught that boy about shields at his age?\u201d Daemon snarled.</p><p>Probably the wolf pups. \u201cWasn\u2019t me.\u201d Lucivar looked at both of them. \u201cSo Daemonar managed to put some kind of shield into the paint so the standard ways of removing it aren\u2019t working? At least, not completely?\u201d</p><p>Saetan was going to strain a muscle trying not to laugh, and Daemon . . .</p><p>\u201cBesides the floor, what else did he paint?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>A beat of silence. Then Saetan said, \u201cHe painted Unka Daemon.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar ended up on the floor, roaring with laughter, which might have pissed off his brother if their father hadn\u2019t ended up on the floor too.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Lucivar said, crawling back up on the chair. He looked at Daemon\u2019s face, which, outside of looking unnaturally flushed, didn\u2019t seem any different. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>Saetan propped himself up against a chair. \u201cLet\u2019s just say Daemon needs to explain this to Jaenelle before he takes his shirt off.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>The pitcher of ale arrived at that moment, making Lucivar wonder if that was luck or his father\u2019s exquisite sense of timing.</p><p>For a few minutes they ate, drank, and generally avoided looking at one another.</p><p>Then Saetan said, \u201cSo. Would you like to tell us why you were still pissed off when you walked in the room?\u201d</p><p>Should have known he couldn\u2019t keep it leashed enough to hide it from those two.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Lucivar drained his glass and refilled it. \u201cCassidy got hurt. She was so focused on running from one kind of pain, she worked until she ripped up her hands.\u201d He hesitated, then looked at Daemon. \u201cI think Grayhaven was the cause of that pain, but I don\u2019t know that for sure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daemon\u2019s eyes looked glazed and a little sleepy\u2014and the chill that was filling the room came from two sources.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bring her back with you?\u201d Saetan asked too softly.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another Warlord Prince at the house. About the same age as Grayhaven. Calls himself Gray. He was tortured when he was fifteen and hasn\u2019t recovered from it mentally or emotionally. It\u2019s safe for him to be a boy, to be nothing that would be considered a threat.\u201d Lucivar took a long swallow of ale. \u201cAnd yet he\u2019s the one who stepped up to the line. He\u2019s the one who told me flat out I had no right to take his Queen anywhere. He called her Cassie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJewels?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t see them, but he felt like Purple Dusk. And he felt like he should have been more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour impression?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not a court yet. The males are resisting, and damned if I could figure out why. So I left some instructions with Vae. I\u2019ll be there for Cassidy\u2019s first moontime to make sure things get sorted out. And if I don\u2019t trust the males in her First Circle the next time I see them, I\u2019ll bring her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Saetan said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Gray?\u201d Daemon asked. \u201cAnything we can do to help him?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar thought for a moment, then shook his head. \u201cNot yet. But I\u2019ll tell you this: if that boy decides to wake up, the Master of the Guard is going to have his hands full.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>As the last bandage came off, Shira studied Cassidy\u2019s hands, then sighed in relief.</p><p>So did Cassidy.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to work them gently,\u201d Shira said,\u201cand I do mean gently. There\u2019s still healing going on under the skin. And the skin itself is still fragile. Pulling on a tough blade of grass could be enough to slice it open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me not to work in the garden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you to be very careful about how much you do for the next few days,\u201d Shira said. \u201cAnd you should put a tight shield over your hands to protect them. And wear gloves.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy rolled her eyes. \u201cNow you sound like my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should have listened to him.\u201d</p><p>They glared at each other. Then Shira looked away, as if suddenly realizing she\u2019d crossed some line.</p><p>And she had.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ve become friends,\u201d Cassidy said, noting the look of surprise and pleasure in Shira\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI guess we have,\u201d Shira replied a little cautiously. \u201cSo, what are you going to do first now that you can do things again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the first thing I\u2019ll do, but tonight I\u2019m going to take a long, hot bath and soak until all of me wrinkles.\u201d To her way of thinking, being given sponge baths because she couldn\u2019t wash herself had been sufficient punishment for ripping up both hands. And needing someone\u2019s help with even more personal needs . . .</p><p>Which made her think of the other thing she needed to discuss with Shira.</p><p>\u201cDo you know a brew to delay a moontime?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>Shira frowned. \u201cWhy would you want to do that? It will only make the next one a lot worse.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy wasn\u2019t sure how to explain without sounding insulting. Because wanting to delay this was insulting.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust them, do you?\u201d Shira asked.</p><p>\u201cTrust who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour First Circle. You don\u2019t trust them to protect you. You don\u2019t trust them not to turn on you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to admit it, but she wasn\u2019t going to deny the truth. A witch was vulnerable during the first three days of her moon cycle because she couldn\u2019t use her own power to protect herself. And she felt far more vulnerable here in Dena Nehele than she had back home in Dharo.</p><p>Shira gave her a considering look. \u201cYou can trust Ranon. He won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not sure he wants to serve me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shira said thoughtfully, \u201che\u2019s sure of that. He\u2019s . . . puzzled . . . by his response to you.\u201d</p><p>A flash of understanding, especially when she realized Shira was acting more like a woman trying to brace herself for a truth that would wound.</p><p>\u201cHe wants to sniff my neck,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>Shira hesitated, then nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s not sure if that means something sexual.\u201d</p><p>Another reluctant nod.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Shira\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not sure what the attraction is. I can\u2019t see or feel anything. And I\u2019m not sure what this impulse means to the males, except it\u2019s not sexual.\u201d She was pretty sure it wasn\u2019t sexual. Maybe she should write to Jaenelle soon and ask. \u201cWhen I was preparing to come here, Jaenelle told me any Warlord Prince who truly belongs to me will want to sniff my neck and I wasn\u2019t to make a fuss about it.\u201d</p><p>Shira\u2019s mouth hung open. \u201cJaenelle? Witch told you that?\u201d</p><p>Obviously the rest of the court knew what she\u2019d told Talon about Jaenelle Angelline. Maybe that was why Theran had been so stiffly polite these past few days. \u201cYes. When I thought about it later, I realized I\u2019d seen all the males in her First Circle stand behind her and a little to the right so that they could . . . Well, they weren\u2019t obvious about it, but basically they were standing there in order to sniff her. But there wasn\u2019t anything sexual about it. I suppose it was sexual with her Consort, but he arrived years after I had served my apprenticeship in the Dark Court, so Jaenelle\u2019s brother Lucivar was the only one I saw kiss her on that spot, and it was friendly. Like when my brother, Clayton, gives me a kiss on the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not sexual,\u201d Shira said, not quite believing.</p><p>Cassidy shook her head and smiled. \u201cRanon is in love with you. I figured that out the first day when you offered your services to the court. So if the two of you want to find a suite of rooms in this place so you can live together, I have no objection. If you want to handfast, we\u2019ll all ignore Theran\u2019s mutters about expenses and have a party.\u201d She frowned. \u201cThere are still Priestesses here, aren\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>Looking a bit dazed, Shira nodded. \u201cBut I\u2019m a Black Widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd judging by the reaction when you first came here, that\u2019s not going to be an easy thing to be openly. But it shouldn\u2019t stop you from being with someone you love.\u201d</p><p>Shira walked over to the window and stared out. Since she kept wiping her cheeks, Cassidy went to the door, intending to slip out and give the other woman a little time to shed happy tears in private.</p><p>\u201cHow close are you?\u201d Shira asked, turning her head a little. \u201cTo your moontime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will start in a few days. Maybe any day now, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can make up a brew that will delay it. Since you\u2019re so close, I\u2019m not sure it will delay it for a full cycle, but it will give you a little more time to get used to the males here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy left the room and paused outside the door. In Dharo, she had made few decisions that had meant much. Here, every decision she made, no matter how small, could ripple through the entire Territory.</p><p>Be what you are. That had been Jaenelle\u2019s last bit of advice.</p><p>Maybe she wouldn\u2019t accomplish much. Maybe her court would decide among themselves to keep her for a year as a token while they actually ruled. The Darkness knew they were all stronger than she, so there wasn\u2019t anything she could do if they opposed her.</p><p>But she had done something of value today, and if she did nothing else while she was here, at least she\u2019d made it possible for two people to love each other openly.</p><p>As she headed for the door that opened onto the terrace, Cassidy couldn\u2019t stop smiling.</p><p>Gray pretended to rake the softened earth in front of him while he watched Cassie. The sun shone on that braid of fire as she walked across the lawn, and her strides were long and easy. Like the rest of her.</p><p>Every morning since the hurting she had come out to sit in the chair he set out for her. They talked about plants while he dug and weeded, reclaiming another piece of the gardens. And she talked to him about Protocol, since he studied a little more of the books each night and asked her questions.</p><p>He enjoyed the simple easiness of being around her, and looked forward to the hour or so they could spend together before she had to go inside to do her Queen work.</p><p>He hoped she would enjoy the surprise he had hidden in the wheelbarrow.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Cassidy said, giving him a wide smile as she held up her hands. \u201cNo more bandages.\u201d</p><p>Setting the rake aside, Gray scrubbed his hands on his pants to clean off a bit of the dirt before taking careful hold of her hands.</p><p>Healed. Not even a small scar to show the damage she had done to her hands.</p><p>Healed but not whole. Not yet. Maybe never. Maybe never as strong as before the hurting.</p><p>He had learned that painful lesson years ago.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not strong enough for digging,\u201d Gray said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t know that until I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice sharpened by a certainty he couldn\u2019t explain. \u201cThey\u2019re not strong enough yet, Cassie. Not for digging in ground that hasn\u2019t been tended for too many years.\u201d</p><p>She looked bewildered\u2014and hurt\u2014that he would snap at her like that.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stand to see her hurting, so he added quickly, \u201cBut you could plant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlant?\u201d</p><p>Gray stepped to one side so that Cassie could see inside the wheelbarrow.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cassie said, picking up one seed pot. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><p>No longer sounding hurt. Now she sounded curious and excited\u2014the seedlings of happiness.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know the fancy name for it, but the common name is blue river,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate trailing plant that has small blue flowers. Starts blooming in late spring and into summer. If you cut it back some at that point, it will have a second blooming season. I was thinking about that boulder you weren\u2019t sure of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still looking at the plant, Cassie nodded. \u201cIt has that funny hole in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figure that hole is about the size of a good-size pot. So if you plant one blue river in that hole and the others in front of the boulder . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will look like a waterfall tumbling down rocks into a river. Gray, that\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d She gave him a quick kiss, right on the mouth, before she turned back to the wheelbarrow and began crooning to the little plants.</p> <p>Gray stood frozen. She had kissed him. But not in a mean way. Not in a way that meant he was going to be tied down and hurt. Not the way the other Queen had done.</p><p>And not quite like a man-and-woman kiss. At least, he didn\u2019t think so. It was done before he\u2019d known it had started.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t mind trying a man-and-woman kiss if the woman was Cassie.</p><p>Would she want to try that kind of kissing with him?</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Cassie stood in front of him, holding two of the seed pots, smiling at him, and looking a little puzzled.</p><p>\u201cYou have the strangest expression on your face,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. He knew better than to answer that question. \u201cDid you ask me something before?\u201d</p> <p>Cassie studied him for a moment, then shook her head. \u201cMales are very strange.\u201d</p><p>Not half as strange as females, Gray thought.</p><p>\u201cI asked where you got the plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. There are a couple of women in town who grow plants for sale. They have greenhouses and everything. And there are two sisters who grow a lot of the plants Healers need for their brews and salves. So when Shira and Ranon went to look at plants yesterday, I went with them. And I found these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take a look at what\u2019s available,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cMaybe we could go back to those places tomorrow morning or the day after.\u201d She wrinkled her nose. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in the town yet; things have been so busy here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Gray asked, wondering why his heart was feeling funny all of a sudden.</p><p>\u201cYou and me. Oh, and I suppose I\u2019ll need an official escort as well just to keep everything proper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtocol,\u201d Gray said, nodding. \u201cYou have to set a good example.\u201d</p> <p>Cassie rolled her eyes. \u201cI know you\u2019ve lived here all your life, but you sound like you\u2019re from Kaeleer.\u201d</p><p>The words made him feel strange\u2014and good. And stronger in a way he couldn\u2019t describe.</p><p>\u201cI thought you could go with me,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cIf you want to,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cI want to.\u201d</p><p>Her smile when she was happy was bright enough to dazzle the sun.</p><p>\u201cDaylight\u2019s wasting,\u201d Cassie said. She set the seed pots aside and held up her hands. \u201cLook. A double shield over the skin and then heavy gardening gloves.\u201d Which she called in and slipped over her hands.</p><p>\u201cAnd your hat,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him but obeyed and called in her hat.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to swear at me?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>He just grinned.</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie!*</p><p>Gray paused to watch the Sceltie\u2019s dance of indecision. Vae clearly had an opinion about Cassie working in the garden\u2014Hell\u2019s fire, the dog had an opinion about everything\u2014but she wasn\u2019t sure if her \u201cpermission to nip\u201d applied to the Queen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all right,\u201d Gray told Vae, glad for the excuse to take a break. Not that he needed an excuse. Not with Cassie. But he didn\u2019t want to admit about himself what he\u2019d been so quick to point out to her\u2014sometimes damage couldn\u2019t be healed all the way if you weren\u2019t careful during the healing.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to know. Wasn\u2019t ready to tell her. Not yet. But he knew the warning signs and knew he needed to take some care or he\u2019d be helpless and hurting.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m all right,\u201d Cassie said. She stripped off her gloves and held up her hands so Vae could see them. \u201cSee? Nothing hurt.\u201d Then she looked at Gray. \u201cBut the hands have had enough work for the day.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and smiled. \u201cNothing more to plant anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that deliberate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>She studied him for a moment as a thread of awareness grew between them. Then she looked at the Sceltie. \u201cDid you come out for walkies?\u201d</p><p>*Theran said I am underfoot and should go outside for a while,* Vae replied.</p><p>\u201cNipped him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>*Many times he will not listen until I nip him. But he is learning.*</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he is.\u201d Cassie vanished her gloves and got to her feet. \u201cI want to take a look at the rest of the garden, get a feel for the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll warn you now,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThis is the best of it. At the far end, the ground is overrun with some kind of weed. Can\u2019t dig it out. It just grows right back. Can\u2019t even burn it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a look.\u201d Cassie turned toward the house. \u201cWhat about that dead tree? Why didn\u2019t anyone take down what\u2019s left of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d Gray rubbed his nose with the back of his hand. \u201cThat honey pear tree is a symbol of the Grayhaven line. That\u2019s why the Queens let it stand. At least, that\u2019s partly why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s dead, Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He saw the moment when she understood.</p><p>\u201cBitches,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dead, but it still taunted them,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to some of the men who used to work here and some whose fathers worked here. They said some of the Queens tried to pull the tree down, but there\u2019s something about it, about what\u2019s left of it. Saws won\u2019t cut the wood. Axes can\u2019t do more than chip at the outside. And the roots are still so chained to the ground, the tree can\u2019t be pulled out either. The soil all around it is so hard it can break a shovel, and Craft can\u2019t touch it at all. So all that time, they said they left the tree to remind everyone that the Grayhaven line was gone, but in truth they left it because they couldn\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because the line isn\u2019t completely gone,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear the names Jared and Lia,Thera and Blaed. They must have been so important to this land, but I know so little. Does anyone know stories about them? Or were those lost too when the other Queens took over Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, there are stories,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI know some. So does Theran. Talon would know more because he knew the four of them. They were friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Talon would share some of those stories with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll tell you. So will I.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the tree and looked a little sad. Then she smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019d better take a look at the rest of the garden before someone comes looking for me.\u201d</p><p>He watched her walk away, with Vae trotting beside her.</p><p>As he shifted his weight from one foot to the other, he felt a warning twinge in his back.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he said.</p><p>It surprised him how bitter his voice sounded that he couldn\u2019t work anymore today. He\u2019d never minded before when he had to stop.</p><p>But that was before it mattered that someone might think he was weak.</p><p>One last thing, he thought as he vanished the tools. He\u2019d get a bucket of water to wet down the new plants, and he\u2019d use Craft to take the weight of the full bucket instead of forcing his body to do more than it should. Then he\u2019d get something to eat and sit in the shade while he studied the next part of the book on\u2014</p><p>*Gray? Gray!*</p><p>His body stiffened in response to the panic in Vae\u2019s voice. He saw Cassie at the far end of the garden, backing away from that weedy spot, one hand clamped over her mouth.</p><p>Something wrong. Something terribly wrong.</p><p>*Gray!*</p><p>He ran.</p><p>The moment Vae saw him running toward Cassie, she ran toward the house. He had no idea who the Sceltie was calling for help, but he was certain she\u2019d do her best to rouse everyone she could.</p><p>He slowed to avoid running Cassie down. \u201cCassie!\u201d Maybe it was nothing worse than a snake or a dead mouse. Maybe . . .</p><p>She turned to look at him. Her freckles were the only color in her face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s witchblood,\u201dshe whispered. Then she threw her arms around him and held on as if her life depended on it. \u201cIt\u2019s witchblood.\u201d</p><p>Her legs buckled, and he went down with her, wincing when his knees hit the ground.</p><p>\u201cSo many,\u201d Cassie sobbed. \u201cSo many.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what to ask, didn\u2019t know what to do, didn\u2019t understand why those black-edged red flowers upset her so much.</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie!*</p><p>Not alone, Gray thought as the Sceltie returned, whining anxiously.</p><p>Voices. Shouts. He couldn\u2019t twist around to see, but moments later Theran and Ranon were there, asking questions he couldn\u2019t answer while Cassie sobbed.</p><p>Then Shira was there, on her knees beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened? Is she hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gray said, so shaken he began to stammer. \u201cShe looked at those weeds and got upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot w-weeds,\u201d Cassie gasped before she started crying harder.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Shira muttered. She called in a bottle Healers used to store tonics, yanked out the stopper, then grabbed a hunk of red braid and pulled Cassie\u2019s head up. \u201cHere. Drink this. Drink!\u201d</p><p>Cassie drank. Gasped. Gulped air.</p><p>But she settled. When she rested her head on Gray\u2019s shoulder, she was still shaking but no longer crying.</p><p>Shira sat back, took a swig from the bottle, then held it out to Gray. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>He obeyed and took a long swallow.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Theran asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBrandy,\u201d Shira replied.</p><p>By now the rest of the First Circle except Talon had reached the spot\u2014even Powell, who was still puffing from the run.</p><p>Gray looked up at Theran. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault, Gray,\u201d Theran replied softly.</p> <p>\u201cSo many,\u201d Cassie whispered. \u201cSo many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many what?\u201d Shira asked with that quiet voice Healers used when they were asking about something painful.</p><p>\u201cOne for each,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cThat\u2019s how it grows. That\u2019s how you know. One plant for each. Living memento mori. Can\u2019t be killed once it takes root, can\u2019t be hidden. Ground soaked in blood nourishes the seed.\u201d</p><p>Gray saw the shock on the men\u2019s faces. Saw Shira pale.</p><p>\u201cCassidy . . . ,\u201d Shira said.</p> <p>\u201cIt grows where a witch was killed,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIt grows where her blood was spilled in violence. So many died in that spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>Gray wasn\u2019t sure which of them was still shaking\u2014he or Cassie\u2014until she pulled away from him to sit up on her own.</p><p>It was him.</p><p>\u201cCan I have more of that?\u201d Cassie asked, reaching for the tonic bottle.</p><p>Shira handed it over without a word.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know who might have died here,Theran?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>Theran looked sick. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. Thera, I think. And Talon\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen so much of this stuff growing in Dena Nehele\u2014 and in the Shalador reserves,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cWas told it was just a weed, an invasive weed. Mother Night.\u201d</p><p>Feeling timid, Gray touched Cassie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s overgrown with weeds and hasn\u2019t been tended for too long,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll tend that ground and the witchblood that grows there.\u201d She paused. \u201cThe Black Widows in the Dark Court told me that witchblood knows the name of the one who has gone, and if you know how, the plant can tell you whose blood nourished the seed.\u201d</p><p>Mutters. Murmurs. Shira shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI can ask how it\u2019s done\u2014if you want to know,\u201d Cassie said, looking at Shira.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014Grayhaven?\u201d Shira said, looking at Theran.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Cassie nodded. When she shifted position, Theran offered a hand to help her stand up.</p><p>Gray got to his feet, wincing a little and pretending he didn\u2019t see the way Shira was studying him before Ranon pulled her up.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to clean up that ground,\u201d Cassie said.</p><p>*Gray and Cassie need to rest,* Vae said.</p><p>\u201cYes, they do,\u201d Shira said. \u201cLady Cassidy\u2019s hands are still fragile, and if she\u2019s going to stay out here and supervise, I want Gray to stay close by and keep her company. But I\u2019d like to help clean up that part of the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo would I,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d Theran said. \u201cDo you have tools we could use?\u201d</p><p>Gray called in the tools he\u2019d vanished, handing them out as Theran, Ranon, and Archerr came up to claim them.</p><p>\u201cThe short-handled claws would work better for the tight places,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still in the shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get them,\u201d Ranon said, handing the hoe to Shira.</p><p>They worked in the garden the rest of the morning, moving carefully between plants that now held a different meaning.</p><p>Gray watched them, frustrated because all he could do was watch. There was an odd comfort in knowing Cassie was just as frustrated that she couldn\u2019t help.</p><p>And there was no comfort at all in the way Theran kept looking at Cassie when he thought no one was watching.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which one is harder to get through,\u201d Cassidy muttered a couple of days later as she stomped to the garden to work off a little frustration. \u201cA man\u2019s head or ground as solid as rock.\u201d</p><p>The day they\u2019d all worked together to clean up the part of the garden filled with witchblood, she\u2019d thought she and Theran had finally settled into some kind of understanding, that he might actually listen to what she was saying instead of telling her it couldn\u2019t be done \u201cthat way.\u201d Hell\u2019s fire! Anyone with a pebble\u2019s worth of brain could figure out Dena Nehele couldn\u2019t be ruled in \u201cthe ordinary way.\u201d They didn\u2019t have enough Queens to rule in \u201cthe ordinary way.\u201d That had been the point! And there was nothing unusual about males ruling on a Queen\u2019s behalf. It was done all the time in Kaeleer. Her cousin Aaron ruled Tajrana, the capital city of Nharkhava, on his Queen\u2019s behalf. And Prince Yaslana ruled Ebon Rih. And she knew there were Warlords assigned to be a Queen\u2019s representative who, in essence, ruled their home villages.</p><p>How in the name of Hell was she supposed to decide which available Queens might be able\u2014and willing\u2014to rule more than their little villages if she couldn\u2019t talk to them? But Prince Grayhaven kept finding reasons for her not to travel and see other parts of Dena Nehele, and he was just as quick with the excuses for why the other Queens\u2014even with an escort of Warlord Princes\u2014couldn\u2019t come to Grayhaven to talk to her.</p><p>And none of the other Warlord Princes challenged his asinine statements because he was Grayhaven.</p><p>\u201cThe man farts every time he opens his mouth,\u201d Cassidy muttered as she reached the big stone shed.</p><p>She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and blew it out. \u201cAnd Poppi would whack your butt if he heard you say that,\u201d she scolded herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy took a step closer to the shed\u2019s open door. Nobody in the part of the shed she could see. Most of the tools were stored neatly now, except for that jumble of things in the back left corner.</p><p>She looked at the old blanket that separated Gray\u2019s room from the rest of the shed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d she called softly. Theran was still in the house, so who was talking to Gray? The voice sounded familiar, but it was muffled too much for her to be sure, except it sounded male\u2014and young.</p><p>Then Gray\u2019s voice rose in a kind of desperate keening. \u201cI\u2019m Grayhaven! I\u2019m Grayhaven!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray!\u201d</p><p>She rushed to the doorway and pulled the blanket aside\u2014and saw him shivering on a pathetic excuse of a bed, caught in some kind of nightmare. He was wearing trousers and nothing else, and she felt her knees grow weak as she stared at the scars on his back.</p><p>\u201cMother Night, Gray,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Grayhaven!\u201d</p><p>She wanted to touch him, wanted to shake him out of the nightmare\u2014or the memory\u2014but she was afraid touching him might frighten him even more.</p><p>She braced herself and said in a firm voice, \u201cPrince Gray, your presence is requested.\u201d</p><p>He jerked, whimpered. But she thought her use of Protocol had pulled him out of the dream-memory, because the next thing he said was, \u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>It took him a couple of tries to turn himself so he was facing the doorway. \u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>His dark hair was matted with sweat, and his face had the drawn, exhausted look of a man who had endured too much.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Cassidy asked, keeping her voice Queen firm. \u201cWhat\u2019s your full name? Your real name?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, then said, \u201cJared Blaed Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the room\u2014at the straight-backed chair that had a flat stone under one leg to keep it from wobbling, at the broken-down chest of drawers that had a single lamp, at the bookcase that had only one unbroken shelf.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best he could do?\u201d she asked too softly as she looked at the room, piece by piece. \u201cYou\u2019re his family, and this is the best he would do?\u201d</p><p>She backed out of the room, letting the blanket fall across the opening.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d Gray called.</p><p>She walked out of the shed, her stride lengthening with every step she took toward the house.</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop, couldn\u2019t answer. Because every step stoked her fury just a little more.</p><p>\u201cThis was your idea to begin with,\u201d Ranon said, dogging Theran\u2019s footsteps with as much persistence as that damn Sceltie. \u201cWhy are you so determined now to stand in the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not standing in the way,\u201d Theran tossed over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t even give Cassidy the courtesy of listening to what she has to say.\u201d</p><p>He turned on Ranon. \u201cIf Warlord Princes are going to rule Dena Nehele, what was the point of trying to get a Queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s the point of having a Queen if you won\u2019t let her do anything?\u201d Ranon snapped. \u201cI can understand not wanting her to travel around the Territory right now, but why are you so determined not to have the few Queens who are left come to Grayhaven to meet her? After all, she rules them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many of those Queens that we passed over are going to be impressed with a witch who wears a Rose Jewel?\u201d Theran asked, feeling bitter again. He had to hide that bitterness from Talon, but he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d hide it from the rest of the First Circle. Especially Ranon.</p><p>\u201cThe Shalador Queens might be willing to come and talk to her\u2014and listen to what she has to say,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cShalador. Shalador. That\u2019s all you harp about, isn\u2019t it? Every meeting of the First Circle, you bring up something about the reserves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to remember our people,\u201d Ranon said with his own touch of bitterness.</p><p>\u201cJust because our Queen has given her consent for you to mount a Black Widow\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your tongue, Grayhaven,\u201d Ranon snarled.</p><p>Theran caught a movement out of the corner of his eye and turned to see Cassidy coming toward him, her hands clenched and a look on her face.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou coldhearted son of a whoring bitch!\u201d</p><p>She rammed him with a force that knocked him into the wall.</p><p>Instinct and temper took over, and he shoved her hard enough that she would have fallen if Ranon hadn\u2019t caught her. She shook off the Opal-Jeweled Warlord Prince, and the expression on Ranon\u2019s face would have been amusing if the woman didn\u2019t look ready to kill someone.</p> <p>\u201cYou made such a point of family, you bastard,\u201d Cassidy snarled. \u201cThe family wing was to be off-limits to the court because this had been the Grayhaven family home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so pissed about that now?\u201d Theran shouted.</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s family!\u201d she shouted back. \u201cBut you stick him in a damn gardening shed, don\u2019t even let him come in for meals, all because someone hurt him, scarred him so he isn\u2019t perfect anymore, and you won\u2019t accept anyone or anything that isn\u2019t perfect, will you? Well, you\u2019re not perfect either, Grayhaven. Far from it.\u201d</p><p>Theran looked at her in disbelief. \u201cThis is about Gray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYES,THIS IS ABOUT GRAY!\u201d</p> <p>She used Craft to enhance her voice, and that shout rattled the windows. And brought everyone running.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Ranon said softly, turning and raising a hand to stop the men who rushed into the room from the other door.</p><p>\u201cJared Blaed Grayhaven,\u201d Cassidy said with a kind of cold anger that put a chill down Theran\u2019s spine. \u201cFamily, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re cousins,\u201d Theran replied cautiously. He wore Green. She wore Rose. He wasn\u2019t in any danger. Not from her. But he couldn\u2019t forget right now that she had the backing of the kind of power that could wipe Dena Nehele and its people out of existence.</p><p>\u201cCousins,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not good enough to be family, is he? Not good enough to stay in your precious house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Something snapped inside him. Something that had festered for a lot of years. Something that cut him every time he\u2019d heard that desperate keening.</p><p>\u201cBecause he was tortured here,\u201d Theran shouted. \u201cHere, in this house. For two years they beat him and hurt him and did things he only remembers in nightmares. And do you know why they did that? Because they thought he was me! Because that bitch thought she had captured the last of the Grayhaven line, and she savored every wound she inflicted.</p><p>\u201cAnd he never told them they\u2019d caught the wrong boy. Never told them he wasn\u2019t Grayhaven. Jared Blaed. That was his name then. Cousins through our mothers, who could trace their line back to Thera and Blaed. He protected me in the only way he could for two years.\u201d</p><p>Theran turned, paced, circled. Wanted to beat her with words.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I want him out in that damn shed? No, Lady, I don\u2019t.\u201d He blinked back the tears stinging his eyes\u2014and refused to see the tears in hers. \u201cBut he\u2019s terrified to come into this house. He won\u2019t even come to the kitchen door to get food. We bring it out to the stables for him. He had to come with us. We couldn\u2019t leave him in the mountain camp, even though the other rogues up there were willing to look after him. But he\u2019s in that shed because it\u2019s the best he can do. All he can tolerate.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy squared her shoulders and raised her chin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that. I didn\u2019t know. But that doesn\u2019t change anything,Theran. He is your family, and he will have a room in the family wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he never sets foot in this house or never sets foot in that room, but he will have a proper room in the family wing, just like you and Talon. He will know it is there if he wants it. And if he\u2019s more comfortable staying in the shed, then it will be fixed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to be\u2014\u201d Theran began.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a suggestion, and it\u2019s not a request,\u201d Cassidy snapped. \u201cThis is an order, Prince. Get it done.\u201d</p><p>She started to turn away, then turned back. \u201cAnd I think we should agree on a division of labor from here on in, Grayhaven. You do what you can\u2014and I\u2019ll do what\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>She turned to leave the room\u2014and Ranon skipped out of her way, raising his hands in a gesture of surrender. The other men who had come in scrambled to give her a clear path to the door.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Theran,\u201d Ranon said softly. \u201cThat woman is pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Theran said. \u201cI guess she is.\u201d He felt shaky, as if he\u2019d clashed with an enemy far more deadly than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cTheran?\u201d</p><p>Mother Night. Gray.</p><p>Theran turned to find Gray standing in the other doorway\u2014the doorway Cassidy had originally come in by. He watched, not sure if offering assistance would help or harm, as Gray walked into the room, shaking more and more with every step.</p><p>Unable to stand it any longer, Theran covered the distance between them, oddly grateful that Ranon came with him as additional support.</p><p>As he put his hands on Gray\u2019s shoulders, he saw Ranon\u2019s face tighten as the man got a look at Gray\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s so mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does. Family is important to Cassie. Family matters. That\u2019s why she\u2019s mad at you. She doesn\u2019t know that it matters to you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the room, Theran. Then she won\u2019t be mad at you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. Not for her.\u201d</p><p>Gray gave him an odd smile. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I have to do it. For her.\u201d</p><p>Theran stiffened at the sound of someone running. Footsteps too light to be a man\u2019s, so who . . . ?</p><p>Shira barreled into the room, pulled up short, and stared at Gray\u2019s back for a long moment before she whispered, \u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>Theran felt a reluctant admiration for her when she quickly regained her composure and her professional attitude.</p><p>\u201cWould it hurt you if I touch your back?\u201d Shira asked Gray.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d But his voice was becoming a tight whisper, a prelude to the pain that usually left him helpless.</p><p>Gray shook, shuddered\u2014and Theran saw the shame in his cousin\u2019s eyes when Gray couldn\u2019t stop himself from whimpering. Not because Shira\u2019s light, gentle touch was hurting him, but because he was afraid of being touched by a female. Because that touch brought back too many memories.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll start simple,\u201d Shira finally said after her examination. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good, strong liniment that will help relax those tight muscles and ease the pain. And I\u2019m recommending you take a mild sedative that will let you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have work,\u201d Gray said, sounding too close to desperate.</p><p>Damn the work! Theran thought.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d Shira said. \u201cToday your only work is to rest and heal. If you do that, by tomorrow you and Lady Cassidy can go back to digging in the garden for an hour or so\u2014under Vae\u2019s supervision.\u201d</p><p>Despite the fact that he was still shaking, Gray tried to smile. \u201cVae bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes her the perfect choice for watching over the two of you,\u201d Shira replied tartly. Then her voice softened. \u201cCome on, now. Let\u2019s get you settled wherever you feel comfortable. Then I can do something about the pain.\u201d</p><p>Gray didn\u2019t argue when Shira led him away, his expression once more that of a docile boy.</p><p>Theran watched Gray and Shira, ignoring the sounds of the other men leaving the room.</p><p>\u201cIt took a lot of courage for him to walk into this house,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>Theran continued to stare at that doorway, even though Shira and Gray were gone. Then he swallowed hard and said, \u201cHe\u2019s always had courage.\u201d</p><p>The door of the Steward\u2019s office was open, but Talon knocked on the wood anyway before entering.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d</p><p>Powell\u2019s smile of greeting wobbled for a moment, then failed altogether. \u201cYes. Please close the door.\u201d</p><p>Not good, Talon thought as he closed the door and settled himself in the visitor\u2019s chair. This was not good.</p><p>Powell lifted the corners of a few papers on his desk, removed an envelope, and handed it to Talon. \u201cThis needs to go to the Keep.\u201d</p><p>Talon stared at the name on the front of the envelope, then studied the seal on the back. \u201cWhen did the Queen give this to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShortly after the midday meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s marked \u2018urgent.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was . . . misplaced . . . for a few hours,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI wanted to discuss the situation with you before I sent this message . . . there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSituation.\u201d He hadn\u2019t needed a message slipped under his door, asking him to meet with Powell, to know something had happened today. He\u2019d felt the tension the moment he left the family wing.</p><p>\u201cLady Cassidy and Prince Theran had an altercation this morning. Sharp words were exchanged\u2014and a few shoves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Talon muttered.</p><p>\u201cAfterward, Lady Cassidy retired to her rooms and hasn\u2019t come down since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not hurt?\u201d Talon asked, making it more of a demand for the right answer than a question.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Neither of them were hurt.\u201d Powell hesitated. \u201cBut that\u2014and the order to get it to the Keep as soon as possible\u2014was the only communication any of us have had from her since then.\u201d</p><p>Telling tales, Cassidy? Talon wondered. It was tempting to toss it into the fire, but someone would have to shoulder the blame for failing to deliver the message\u2014and sometimes the first break in trust was the one that could never be fully repaired.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d Talon said. \u201cI can ride the Sapphire Winds, so I\u2019ll be able to get it there faster than anyone else.\u201d And I want a chance to tell our side of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Powell nodded. \u201cIf anyone asks where you\u2019ve gone?\u201d</p><p>Talon vanished the envelope. \u201cTell them I had a meeting.\u201d</p><p>He returned to his room long enough to warm and drink a glass of yarbarah. He hadn\u2019t ridden the Winds outside Dena Nehele since he\u2019d become demon-dead, and he had no idea how much power might be drained by riding those psychic roadways through the Darkness over a long distance.</p> <p>Had no idea what he would face once he got to the Keep.</p><p>And he had no idea if the High Lord of Hell would allow him to return to Dena Nehele\u2014and the people there who were still among the living.</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>The Black Mountain. Ebon Askavi. Warrens of rooms carved out of the living stone to house a court, a library that was, supposedly, the repository of the Blood\u2019s history\u2014and Witch.</p><p>No paneling or plaster on the walls to soften the weight of stone. No illusion to help someone forget that the weight of a mountain rested above a man\u2019s head.</p> <p>The feeling of age pressed down on Talon as much as the feeling of stone. And even though the sitting room where he had been taken to wait was as finely furnished as any he\u2019d ever seen, he wondered how anyone could stand living in this place.</p><p>Then the sitting room door opened.</p><p>Talon didn\u2019t need to see the Black Jewels to know that the Warlord Prince who walked into the room was dangerous. Just looking into those gold eyes would tell anyone with any sense that you walked softly in this man\u2019s presence.</p><p>Especially if you were demon-dead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the High Lord,\u201d the man said, a croon in his deep voice.</p><p>A shudder went through Talon at the sound of that voice. Nothing threatening, not in and of itself, but he wondered how many men hadn\u2019t survived a meeting when the High Lord\u2019s voice had held that particular tone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Talon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brings Dena Nehele\u2019s Master of the Guard to the Keep?\u201d</p><p>Apparently Prince Sadi was sharing Cassidy\u2019s reports with his father. Why else would the High Lord know who he was?</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, Mother Night, and may the Darkness be merciful.</p><p>Talon called in the envelope and held it out. \u201cMessage from Lady Cassidy.\u201d</p><p>Saetan closed the distance between them and took the envelope just as a chime sounded and a tray with a decanter and two ravenglass goblets appeared on a table.</p><p>\u201cWould you join me in a glass of yarbarah, Prince Talon?\u201d Saetan asked. \u201cThen we can sit comfortably while you tell me whatever it is you came to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just delivering Lady Cassidy\u2019s message,\u201d Talon said. \u201cI wear Sapphire and could ride a Wind darker and faster than anyone else in the court could ride.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive me some credit, boyo,\u201d Saetan said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Steward. I know a Master of the Guard doesn\u2019t deliver messages, no matter how urgent, unless there\u2019s more than one message. Sit down.\u201d</p><p>He sat.</p><p>\u201cGuess no one gives you much argument,\u201d Talon said, feeling a little stunned that he had obeyed before he\u2019d consciously decided to obey.</p><p>Setting the envelope aside, Saetan warmed two glasses of yarbarah, then handed one to Talon. \u201cA man uses the tools he has available, and he learns to use them well. The males in the court seldom argued with a direct order. The coven . . .\u201d He shrugged, and his smile was as affectionate as it was reluctant. \u201cThat tone of voice usually stopped them long enough to give me a chance to argue about what they were\u2014or weren\u2019t\u2014going to do.\u201d</p><p>Settling into a chair, Saetan put his goblet on the tray, picked up the envelope, and called in his half-moon glasses. \u201cSo let\u2019s see what has Cassidy so riled up she wasn\u2019t willing to wait to send this with her regular report.\u201d</p><p>Talon almost choked as he swallowed a mouthful of yarbarah. \u201cIt\u2019s addressed to Prince Sadi.\u201d</p><p>Saetan broke the seal and removed the sheets of paper. \u201cPrince Sadi gave me the authority to open any messages from Dena Nehele that I felt needed to be considered immediately. I think something marked \u2018urgent\u2019 qualifies as such a message, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Talon said, setting his glass aside. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Cassidy and Theran wrangled about today or why it got her so riled, but they seem to butt heads more often than not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is not good for Queen or court,\u201d Saetan said mildly as he read the first page and went on to the second. \u201cBut we both know Theran wasn\u2019t chosen to be First Escort because he was qualified for the position.\u201d</p><p>Talon felt his jaw drop.</p><p>Saetan finished reading the second page. He glanced at Talon as he vanished the papers and envelope. \u201cOh, don\u2019t look so surprised. Theran had decided he didn\u2019t like her before they left the Keep to go to Dena Nehele, and by now Cassie\u2019s dislike for him is probably just as strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s . . . disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn about his disappointment,\u201d Saetan snarled. \u201cIf he can\u2019t honor the Queen he chose to serve and do his duties, he should ask to be released from the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only the twelve of us,\u201d Talon protested. \u201cIf any man steps aside, we lose the court!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should explain to your boy that he should help build the court instead of trying to break it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say about him in that letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Talon sat back, feeling as if he\u2019d been kicked in the chest.</p><p>\u201cShe said nothing about him,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t mentioned Theran, I wouldn\u2019t have known he was involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was told they\u2019d had words today, and after that, she wrote that letter. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Talon. You haven\u2019t thought.\u201d</p><p>There was an angry heat in Saetan\u2019s eyes, but it was the ice in his voice that made Talon sit very still.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019ll give you something to think about,\u201d Saetan said too softly. \u201cYour boy doesn\u2019t like the Queen he accepted, and whether you agree with him or not, you\u2019ve let him set the tone. You\u2019ve let his disrespect set the flavor of the court. You\u2019ve seen enough to know better, but you\u2019re letting it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Master of the Guard. Stand up for your Queen. Even if it means standing against Theran.\u201d</p><p>Talon said nothing. What could he say?</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know who would have liked Cassidy?\u201d Saetan asked. \u201cJared would have liked her. Thera would have liked her. Lia would have understood her. I can\u2019t say how Blaed would have responded, since he never made it to the Dark Realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw them?\u201d Talon whispered.</p><p>\u201cI saw them, briefly, and got a feel for the kind of people they were. Lia stayed the longest because she waited for Jared. Once he arrived, they had a little time together. Then their power faded and they became a whisper in the Darkness. Thera\u2019s power was almost burned out by the time she made the transition to demon-dead, so she didn\u2019t stay in the Dark Realm for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife?\u201d</p><p>A hesitation.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things that are said at the end that would never be said otherwise,\u201d Saetan said softly, \u201cand I don\u2019t break the confidences of the dead. But I can tell you this. She loved you,Talon, and she understood why you felt you had to stay. She hoped you understood why she couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Talon closed his eyes and nodded.</p><p>\u201cTell Cassie it will take a couple of days, but we\u2019ll take care of her request.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing in the High Lord\u2019s tone that invited him to ask about the request, so he didn\u2019t. He just thanked the man for his time and gladly followed the servant who responded to the High Lord\u2019s summons and escorted him to one of the landing webs.</p><p>He didn\u2019t feel easy until he was riding the Sapphire Winds and heading home.</p><p>Jared would have liked her. Thera would have liked her. Lia would have understood her.</p><p>Yes, he had a lot to think about.</p><p>Saetan walked into a sitting room similar to the one he\u2019d left at the Keep in Terreille, but this one held a golden-haired treasure.</p><p>\u201cBefore we were interrupted, I believe you were going to tell me why you\u2019re spending a few days with me here,\u201d he said as he settled on the sofa next to Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cBecause my moontime was supposed to start this evening, and Daemon politely requested that I spend the three days when I\u2019m vulnerable here instead of remaining at the Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith him.\u201d She looked tired and sad.</p><p>\u201cWas he right? Did it start?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sour look. \u201cYou know it did.\u201d</p><p>Of course he knew. He smelled the change in her scent the moment he walked in the room.</p><p>\u201cGive him time, witch-child. He\u2019s running scared. He loves you with everything that\u2019s in him\u2014and he\u2019s just beginning to understand that it really is everything that\u2019s in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss him.\u201d</p><p>Saetan drew her closer and put an arm around her shoulders. \u201cNot half as much as he\u2019s missing you. And right about now, he\u2019s wondering why he\u2019d been such a fool as to ask you to come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s a mirror.\u201d He kissed her head. \u201cSo tomorrow when he shows up, don\u2019t tell him he looks like he hasn\u2019t slept, because he hasn\u2019t slept. And don\u2019t bristle over whatever paltry excuse he makes about you needing a nap. Just tuck in with him so he can get some sleep\u2014and let him heal his wounds in his own way.\u201d</p><p>Those sapphire eyes looked at him, looked through him.</p><p>\u201cWill he heal, Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn order to be with you, Daemon needs to heal. So he\u2019ll heal,\u201d Saetan replied.</p><p>They sat quietly for a couple of minutes. Then Jaenelle said, \u201cSo why were you called to the Keep in Terreille?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor this.\u201d He called in Cassidy\u2019s note and handed the pages to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>About halfway through the first page, Jaenelle began to chuckle. Wasn\u2019t his reaction to the words, but he had suspected it would be hers.</p><p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cCassie is really pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd showing a fair amount of backbone,\u201d Saetan said.</p> <p>\u201cShe always had that, but she never had to fight for anything enough for it to show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like she\u2019s fighting now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd may the Darkness help whoever is dumb enough to get in her way.\u201d Jaenelle folded the pages and handed them back to him. \u201cShe didn\u2019t provide any dimensions. Hard to really know what she wants, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He knew a leading question when he heard one. \u201cYes, it is. Any suggestions?\u201d As if he hadn\u2019t guessed.</p><p>Jaenelle smiled at him. \u201cI think we know a good carpenter who could be persuaded to work in Dena Nehele for a few days.\u201d</p> <p>He returned her smile. \u201cYes, I think we do.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Daemon walked into his closet and pulled a white silk shirt off its hanger. As he stuffed one arm into a sleeve, he muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s your own fault, you brainless fool. So do something about it.\u201d And he damn well was going to do something about it just as soon as he got this miserable rag of a shirt over his shoul\u2014</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d Jazen snapped, rushing into the closet. \u201cStop!You\u2019ll rip the seams.\u201d</p><p>Daemon bared his teeth and snarled at his valet. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Lord Aldric that he couldn\u2019t get the measurements right? I give him enough business.\u201d</p> <p>The valet stripped the shirt off him and hung it back up with a fussy care that honed Daemon\u2019s temper\u2014and also made him wary.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit because it\u2019s not your shirt,\u201d Jazen said, examining the shoulder seams for rips.</p><p>\u201cThen why is it in my closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Lady Angelline\u2019s shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is it in my closet?\u201d</p><p>Jazen huffed out a breath, and Daemon got the impression the valet had hoped never to have this conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt has to stay in your closet with the rest of your clothes in order to absorb your scent,\u201d Jazen said.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I smell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you want to pick a fight, look elsewhere,\u201d Jazen said with a rigid courtesy. \u201cYou asked a question; I\u2019m trying to give you an answer.\u201d</p><p>Daemon closed his eyes and struggled to leash his temper. \u201cMy apologies, Jazen,\u201d he finally said. \u201cI\u2019m a bit . . . cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrince, you passed cranky halfway through breakfast\u2014which is when Beale suggested I pack a bag for you so that you could leave the moment you decided to go to the Keep.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d always been so good at hiding feelings he didn\u2019t want anyone to see. When had he stopped being good at hiding?</p><p>He opened his eyes and looked at Jazen. \u201cThe shirt.\u201d</p><p>Jazen selected another white silk shirt and handed it to him. It didn\u2019t look any different from the other one\u2014except it fit him perfectly.</p><p>\u201cServants are discreet,\u201d Jazen said. \u201cEspecially personal servants. And while they won\u2019t discuss things that go on in the household with anyone outside their house, they do talk among themselves. So I began to see a pattern with the laundry. Lady Angelline would borrow one of your shirts, and when it was laundered, it would be returned to her closet. But the second time she wore it, she would seem dissatisfied\u2014and go browsing in your closet again. That\u2019s when I realized the shirt itself wasn\u2019t the attraction. The appeal was your scent\u2014physical and psychic\u2014that was absorbed by the material.</p><p>\u201cI also realized from the things the maids said that your shirts were a little too big to be comfortably big, and it was easy enough to learn that the High Lord\u2019s shirts had been a better fit. So the last time I was in Amdarh to place an order for your shirts, I took the liberty of talking to Lord Aldric, and he made a couple of shirts that were just a little smaller than your measurements for shoulders and sleeves. I put a little bead on the hanger so that those shirts are easy to identify, and I position them so that Lady Angelline is more likely to choose one of them than any other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Daemon said. He hadn\u2019t considered why Jaenelle chose to wear one of his shirts. The way she looked always aroused him, even when it was clear she had no interest in him doing anything with that arousal. \u201cDo you know why she does that?\u201d</p><p>Jazen hesitated. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t presume to know what the Lady thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked, Jazen. I\u2019m not going to hold your opinion against you.\u201d</p><p>Jazen hesitated a moment longer. \u201cThe servants at the Hall are very discreet,\u201d he said again, emphasizing that point, \u201cbut they\u2019ve told me a little about things that happened before the Lady came to live with the High Lord. So I would understand why she responds to some things the way she does.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing that she first started wearing the High Lord\u2019s shirts when she felt nervous or vulnerable because she needed the reminder that she was safe, that he would stand as her sword and shield. Later on, since Helene and the laundry maids didn\u2019t remember Lady Angelline abandoning his shirts after a couple of washings and she only occasionally borrowed a different one, I think she was at an age when she simply liked wearing one of his shirts\u2014and she enjoyed a small rebellion against a father who liked women to dress for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she arrived at the table well dressed but in a man\u2019s shirt,\u201d Daemon said\u2014and wondered if Saetan had been amused or annoyed by that maneuver.</p><p>He missed her so much he ached. Missed her so much the loneliness gnawed at his gut. He hadn\u2019t been able to sleep last night because her absence was too much of a reminder of all the nights of misery when he\u2019d thought she was dead.</p><p>But this he had done to himself. He had sent her away to keep her safe from a potentially dangerous adversary.</p><p>Him.</p><p>But he had to go to the Keep. Had to be with her. And had to believe that Saetan would do whatever needed to be done if he crossed some line that shouldn\u2019t be crossed.</p><p>\u201cSo the High Lord\u2019s scent represents safety,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cWhat does she get from me?\u201d</p><p>Jazen studied him for a long moment before saying quietly,\u201cIf I\u2019ve understood correctly, you\u2019re the only man Lady Angelline has ever welcomed as a lover. Considering her past, I would say, Prince, that your scent represents pleasure and love\u2014and trust.\u201d</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>\u201cYou brainless, pigheaded ass.\u201d</p><p>Theran stopped at the edge of the terrace and faced Cassidy, choking on the words that razored his throat. He wanted to fight, wanted to spew out his own opinions and disappointments, but he didn\u2019t dare. Not after Talon returned from an unexplained visit to the Keep and told him flat out that from now on, the Master of the Guard would back the Queen in any dispute, no questions asked.</p><p>So no matter what Lady Cassidy did or said, if she complained about him, he would be in the wrong.</p><p>The only good thing about Cassidy snapping at him this morning was the look on Gray\u2019s face. Maybe his cousin would start to realize Cassidy wasn\u2019t so wonderful after all.</p><p>\u201cNo need to be pointing the way,\u201d a rough voice said. \u201cWhen her temper is on the boil, the girl sounds just like her mother.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy\u2019s eyes widened with a strange kind of apprehension. \u201cPoppi?\u201d she said as she turned toward the terrace doors and looked at the burly stranger. \u201cPoppi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>The look on her face as she launched herself at the man, who hugged her hard enough to lift her off her feet.</p><p>I\u2019ve never seen her happy, Theran thought, feeling uncomfortable about that realization because he might be partly to blame.</p><p>*Who is he?* Gray asked as he joined Theran on the edge of the terrace.</p><p>The psychic communication startled Theran since Gray used it so rarely.</p><p>*I don\u2019t know,* Theran replied. *But he seems to know her well.*</p><p>A flash of something from Gray, gone too fast to identify.</p><p>The man set Cassidy down, then smiled broadly as he ran his hands down her arms. But his smile faded as he held her hands, his thumbs brushing her palms. Sadness clouded his face as he looked at her hands.</p><p>\u201cPoppi . . . ,\u201d Cassidy began.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s best if we not have words about this.\u201d He nodded as if he\u2019d made some decision. \u201cYes, I think it\u2019s best.\u201d</p><p>Theran caught sight of Ranon coming up behind the stranger and figured it was time to do his duty as First Escort before Ranon did it for him. So he said, \u201cLady?\u201d in a tone that politely demanded information.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Looking flustered, Cassidy linked her arm with the stranger\u2019s and turned to face him. \u201cPoppi, this is Prince Theran Grayhaven, my First Escort. And that\u2019s his cousin, Gray.\u201d She looked over her shoulder. \u201cAnd that\u2019s Prince Ranon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d the man said, touching two fingers to the brim of an old brown hat.</p><p>Certainly doesn\u2019t look worried about facing Warlord Princes, Theran thought.</p><p>\u201cPrince Theran, gentlemen, this is my father, Lord Burle.\u201d</p><p>Theran saw Gray\u2019s eyes widen.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s come to visit?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Burle said. Letting go of Cassidy, he pulled a piece of paper from the inside pocket of his jacket and handed it to Cassidy.</p><p>She opened it, read it\u2014and just stared at it until Theran wanted to rip it out of her hands and find out what in the name of Hell was going on.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Cassidy finally said.</p><p>\u201cSeems clear enough,\u201d Burle said.</p><p>\u201cI asked Prince Sadi to send a bed, a dresser, and a bookcase,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cYou left out a few details, Kitten. Instead of sending something that may not be what you wanted, the Prince sent me. Four days of my time to cobble together the furniture you wanted. If it takes longer than that to get it all done, I might have some pieces already made that will do, or we can negotiate for more time. I brought tools and lumber and other things. Was brought down by Coach, courtesy of Prince Sadi. The driver says he can leave the Coach as a supply shed while I\u2019m here, but it\u2019s still sitting on the landing web beyond the gates and needs to be moved out of the way, so he\u2019ll set it wherever you want before he heads back to Kaeleer.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can take care of that,\u201d Ranon said, looking at Cassidy. \u201cYou want it near the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually . . .\u201d Cassidy looked flustered. \u201cThe furniture is for Gray, so somewhere near the back of the gardens would probably be more convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me?\u201d Gray said, looking stunned.</p> <p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Burle said, \u201cperhaps Prince Gray could give me a few minutes of his time and show me the space and give me some thoughts about what might suit him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you just got here,\u201d Cassidy protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be here for the next few days,\u201d Burle replied. \u201cBut when I\u2019m paid for a full day\u2019s work, I give a full day\u2019s work. So you get on with your work, and I\u2019ll get on with mine, and I\u2019ll see you at dinner. Go on, now. Git.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you allowed to talk to a Queen like that?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, no,\u201d Burle said, laughing. \u201cBut I\u2019m not talking to a Queen now, am I? I\u2019m talking to my daughter.\u201d He gave Cassidy a comically fierce look. \u201cYou still here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d Cassidy grumbled as a smile tugged her lips. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t take much brainpower to figure out Lord Burle was going to be reporting personally to Prince Sadi when he went home, so Theran extended his right hand and said politely,\u201cLady, if you\u2019re ready, the Steward is waiting to review some information about the Provinces.\u201d</p><p>His conduct as he escorted her into the house was absolutely correct.</p><p>Too bad she looked so stunned by it.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s father. This man is Cassie\u2019s father.</p><p>Gray couldn\u2019t keep his mind on anything but the big man walking beside him\u2014including where he put his feet\u2014so he kept tripping over nothing.</p> <p>\u201cI guess you\u2019ve known Cassie for a long time,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cAll her life,\u201d Burle replied with an odd smile and a twinkle in his eyes.</p><p>Fool. Idiot. Gray wanted to smack himself. Now he was tripping over his tongue as well as his feet. Could he sound any dumber? Why couldn\u2019t he sound like Theran or Ranon or any other grown man?</p><p>And why did it suddenly matter so much that this man didn\u2019t look at him and see a boy easily dismissed?</p><p>\u201cI guess Cassie was upset about the stuff in the shed,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see the note myself, but I gathered she was pretty riled about it,\u201d Burle replied.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t need to get riled. It\u2019s not important.\u201d</p><p>Burle stopped walking. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell her that, did you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201dAnd considering the way Burle looked and sounded right now, he was very glad he hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>\u201cSmart man. When a woman\u2019s riled up about something, the biggest mistake a man can make is telling her it\u2019s not important. She won\u2019t hear it the way the words are meant, and sometimes it can take a long time to mend things between a man and a woman\u2014if they can be mended at all. If she thinks something is important, it\u2019s best for the man to treat it as such.\u201d</p><p>Gray thought about that. \u201cBecause treating the thing that\u2019s got her riled as important tells her that she\u2019s important?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way of it,\u201d Burle agreed, continuing on to the shed.</p><p>When they entered the shed, Gray wished he had straightened the tools, swept the floor. Something. But, Hell\u2019s fire, he hadn\u2019t expected Cassie\u2019s father to show up!</p><p>Burle pushed the old blanket aside and pursed his lips. \u201cYou gonna get a new chair to put in that corner? With a better lamp, that would give you a place to read. I\u2019m figuring you like books, since a bookcase is one of the pieces requested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like books, stories and such,\u201d Gray said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m studying the Protocol books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtocol is a good thing to know,\u201d Burle said, nodding.</p><p>But Gray\u2019s thoughts had followed a different path. \u201cYou would know stories about when Cassie was little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know stories,\u201d Burle agreed. \u201cMight even share a few.\u201d</p><p>Gray smiled. He wanted to hear those stories, wanted to share more than the now of Cassie\u2019s life. \u201cWhen I have a daughter, can I call her Kitten?\u201d</p><p>Burle made a strange sound. \u201cYou\u2019re skipping a few steps in the dance, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Burle studied him a bit too long before saying, \u201cYou know how to use a hammer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to build things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to learn?\u201d</p><p>Gray hesitated. He did want to learn, and he wanted to spend time with Burle,who understood an important difference between a daughter and a Queen\u2014and had shown him, and everyone else, that Cassie understood the difference. That was something the Queens who had controlled Dena Nehele before the witch storm killed them all hadn\u2019t understood. But he didn\u2019t want to risk what might happen if he wasn\u2019t honest before they began.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t work a full day,\u201d Gray said, feeling bitter because he didn\u2019t want to be seen as someone less. \u201cNot yet. I was . . . tortured . . . when I was younger, and sometimes my body doesn\u2019t work right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour body\u2019s not working right because you overworked it recently?\u201d Burle asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded, unable to look the older man in the eyes. \u201cShira says I can work a few hours a day, but not more than that, not yet, and Vae will get yappy about it if I try to do more. And not just yappy. Vae bites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who might Vae be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Sceltie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Burle nodded. \u201cHeard of them. Haven\u2019t met one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will,\u201d Gray said darkly. \u201cVae has opinions about everything.\u201d</p><p>Burle looked at the room. \u201cTell you what. I\u2019ll trade you. You help me for two hours and learn a bit in the process, and I\u2019ll give you two hours of labor to help take care of your work. And we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Burle didn\u2019t think less of him for not being able to work a full day. Didn\u2019t say anything about the torture. Was just as matter-of-fact about it all as Lucivar had been.</p><p>Something inside Gray relaxed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start by taking some measurements,\u201d Burle said. \u201cThen, while we\u2019re taking care of some of your work, we can talk about how to make some furniture that will suit you and still make my girl happy.\u201d</p><p>Later that evening, after a meal when no one seemed able to relax enough to just talk, Cassidy and Burle went out walking, heading toward open fields that were away from the house\u2014and the people.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Burle asked.</p><p>Cassidy linked her arm with her father\u2019s and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Burle said after a minute. \u201cLet me put it this way: what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran is a pigheaded ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re entitled to your opinion, Kitten, but I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re entitled to shame him in front of the people he has to work with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He does it to me.\u201d</p><p>Burle stopped walking, and Cassidy felt an odd chill in the air.</p><p>Mother Night. Her father was a Warlord who wore Tiger Eye, and under most circumstances, Burle wouldn\u2019t think of going up against a Warlord Prince. But fathers weren\u2019t always careful when they stepped up to defend a daughter.</p><p>\u201cHe blocks everything I try to do,\u201d Cassidy said hurriedly. \u201cHe won\u2019t let me go out to the Provinces to meet the remaining Queens and see who might be willing\u2014and capable\u2014of doing more than they\u2019re doing now. Hell\u2019s fire! He doesn\u2019t tell the housekeeper how to do her work, but he\u2019s trying to make every decision for me!\u201d</p><p>Burle hesitated\u2014and the air around them changed back to evening cool.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve gathered, going out and about just yet may not be the wisest\u2014or safest\u2014thing for a Queen to do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut Theran won\u2019t let those Queens come to Grayhaven either. He even got his back up when I wanted to go into town with Gray and look at plants for the garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might have his reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretty enough to impress anyone,\u201d Cassidy muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s foolish talk, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Is it really that foolish? she wondered. Since she didn\u2019t want her father challenging Theran\u2014and getting killed because of it\u2014she held her tongue.</p><p>\u201cTime for plain talk, Kitten,\u201d Burle said. \u201cQueens do important work, and they are as necessary to a land as they are to its people. They can make or break a Territory. Hell\u2019s fire, they can make or break a Province or a village. But you\u2019ve missed something along the way, my girl. What you do is work, and when you accepted this contract, you were hired for a particular job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one seems to want me to do that job,\u201d Cassidy said, her voice roughened by frustration.</p><p>\u201cIncluding you?\u201d</p><p>Barely enough light to see his face, but enough to know it was a serious question.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I have an idea for a piece of furniture,\u201d Burle said, \u201cand I build it just the way I see it in my mind, exactly the way it suits me to build it out of particular materials. I take pride in the work. Some people will like it and some won\u2019t, but it\u2019s all mine. And then there are other times when I\u2019m hired to help someone build a piece of furniture the way they want it built. Their vision, their design. I\u2019ll make suggestions if I foresee a problem in the design or materials, but I\u2019m not the designer, Kitten. I\u2019m the skilled laborer who\u2019s helping someone else create something that matters to them. And even if I think it could have been done differently\u2014or better\u2014I respect what they\u2019re trying to do and give them the best work I can.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been here a few weeks. Prince Theran\u2019s been here his whole life, watching what bad Queens did to his land and his people. I\u2019ve been working with Gray this afternoon, and he\u2019s told me a fair amount about his cousin. Enough for me to figure out that Theran wants to do right by his people and do right by Dena Nehele. The name Grayhaven means something here, and it\u2019s a weight as well as a privilege to carry the name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo I should help him build a new foundation the way he thinks it should be built?\u201d Which reminded her of one of Burle\u2019s sayings: Don\u2019t go knocking down a wall because you think the room will look better when all you were asked to do was paint.</p><p>\u201cA year from now, you can walk away from these people and their problems. He can\u2019t. Won\u2019t. Is he pigheaded?\u201d Burle shrugged. \u201cProbably couldn\u2019t have survived if he wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Nothing to say when Poppi put it like that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what else I figured out in these few hours. You and Theran might not be as far apart as you both seem to think.\u201d Burle smiled and patted her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re looking to prove something to yourself. He\u2019s looking to prove something to his people. Maybe, Kitten, the reason you\u2019re scrapping instead of working together is that you both want too much too fast, and you\u2019re getting in your own way.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Cassidy pulled her nightgown over her head, then pressed a hand against her abdomen. A heaviness, settling low. A dull ache that got more pronounced every time she stood up this evening.</p><p>Well, Shira warned her that it would hurt more if she delayed her moontime. Looked like she was going to find out how much more.</p> <p>She called in her supplies and tucked them in a bathroom drawer where they would be handy, then got into bed, feeling chilled despite the mild night. She plumped up pillows and opened the book she was reading. But she didn\u2019t feel like reading.</p><p>When she first arrived in Dena Nehele, it felt like an adventure, like a chance to do something good. Since then, she felt like she was constantly slogging through emotional mud that was knee-deep and getting deeper. She could see the value of looking at this like a contract job, but that didn\u2019t seem to be working either, because every time she\u2019d asked Theran what he would like to do about anything, he danced away from giving her a straight answer. He opposed her suggestions but wouldn\u2019t make any of his own because that wasn\u2019t a First Escort\u2019s duty.</p><p>And why not? If his reason for opposing her suggestions was superior knowledge of what was happening in the Provinces and villages, why didn\u2019t he share the information?</p><p>Sweet Darkness, she missed her father, and he\u2019d left only yesterday.</p><p>Cassidy snorted. \u201cLeft out a few details in my letter, my eye.\u201d The dresser had already been made, and the wood had been cut for a small bookcase. Since he\u2019d brought a mattress as part of the supplies, her father had had a good idea of how big the bed could be.</p><p>It had been an excuse to come visit, but she wasn\u2019t sure whose idea it had been\u2014her father\u2019s, Prince Sadi\u2019s, or the High Lord\u2019s. Didn\u2019t matter. Besides her own time with Poppi, her father\u2019s visit had done so much good for Gray. One of Burle\u2019s sayings was \u201cWork hard, but work smart,\u201d and his practical balance of when to use muscle and when to use Craft\u2014and when to rest\u2014helped Gray feel less wounded.</p> <p>And the occasional silly smile on Gray\u2019s face, combined with a twinkle in Burle\u2019s eyes, meant her father had been telling tales about her. She might have wondered more about what was said if Gray hadn\u2019t found the courage to enter the house and join them for meals the last day Burle was there.</p><p>That had been her father\u2019s finest piece of work.</p><p>The only person who hadn\u2019t warmed to Burle was Theran, who had remained freezingly polite. Even Talon, after he\u2019d realized Burle wasn\u2019t uneasy about being around someone who was demon-dead, joined them in the evenings to play cards or just talk.</p><p>Only Theran had viewed her less-than-aristo background as further proof that she wasn\u2019t worthy of ruling Dena Nehele.</p><p>\u201cLet him take a piss in the wind,\u201d Cassidy muttered, putting the book aside, since even reading seemed too much effort tonight.</p><p>As she pulled the covers up and tried to find a comfortable position, she heard Craft-enhanced scratching on her suite\u2019s door.</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie!*</p><p>To avoid getting out of bed, she used Craft to open the door to the suite and the glass doors that led into her bedroom.</p> <p>*You are not downstairs with the males,* Vae said as soon as she entered the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cNeeded some quiet time tonight,\u201d Cassidy replied. And needed some time to think about what she was going to do in the morning when every male around her would react to the scent of moon\u2019s blood\u2014and to the fact that she would be vulnerable, unable to use her own power during the first three days without causing herself debilitating pain.</p><p>*You are not well?* Vae asked.</p><p>An odd hesitation in the question, and the same phrasing a human would use to ask about such a personal subject. But why would the Sceltie know, or care, about her moontime?</p><p>\u201cWant to keep me company?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>Vae jumped up on the bed and lay down next to her. Cassidy put her arm around the dog and cuddled closer, the warmth of that furry body soon easing the ache in her lower belly as her muscles relaxed.</p><p>Sighing, she shifted her head to a more comfortable spot on the pillows, and fell sleep.</p><p>Vae dozed on and off throughout the night, waiting for the change in scent that would tell her for certain if Cassie was moody because her sire had gone home or if it was the blood time that meant Cassie wasn\u2019t safe around males. Even the males who were supposed to protect her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t sensible for human females to come into heat so often, but there were many things about humans that were not sensible. That was why Scelties had been looking after humans for such a long time.</p><p>Cassie was a Queen, and her court should protect her. Theran should protect her.</p><p>But Yas did not trust Cassie\u2019s court, did not think the males would defend her properly. Ladvarian saidYas knew how to protect a Queen. Ladvarian said Yas was a human the kindred could trust.</p><p>Ladvarian had learned his Craft from Jaenelle, who was the special Queen, even for kindred, and Ladvarian had taught other kindred what he had learned. So Vae knew her Craft, and she knew Yas understood things about the males here that she did not. Even Theran.</p><p>Well before dawn, Cassie\u2019s scent changed.</p><p>Vae wiggled backward until her head was level with Cassie\u2019s female place. Then she sniffed to confirm the scent.</p><p>Human females did not like to be sniffed there by anyone but their mates, so it was good that Cassie was still sleeping.</p><p>Jumping off the bed, Vae padded out of the bedroom and used Craft to pull aside a curtain on one window in the living area.</p><p>Early. No one awake yet. But when the first birds woke up and began to chirp, Cook and her helpers would wake up too and start making food for the day. Then the Blood who took care of the house would wake up.</p><p>But not yet. No one but Talon would be awake now, and he did not come to Cassie\u2019s rooms, so he wouldn\u2019t know about the change in her scent. Not yet.</p><p>She wore Purple Dusk. Since she couldn\u2019t ride a faster, darker Wind than the Purple Dusk, the Keep was far away.</p><p>Cassie needed protection now. Cassie needed Yas.</p><p>Cassie would be safe enough until the males smelled the blood.</p><p>Vae leaped through the window, using Craft to pass through the curtain and glass. She landed lightly on air, two stories above the ground, and floated there for a minute.</p><p>Going up was faster than going down and around, so still floating on air, she trotted up one side of the roof and down the other before leaping away from the house and gliding over the ground and locked gates.</p><p>Landing lightly, she trotted over to the landing web and took a moment to make sure of her direction. Then she caught the Purple Dusk Wind and rode to Ebon Askavi.</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>Wanting nothing more than to spend an hour with the novel currently intriguing him before he retired earlier than usual, Saetan turned away from his suite and retraced his steps to one of the Keep\u2019s private sitting rooms, where Lucivar was doing a slow prowl.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason why you\u2019re showing up here every morning?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cI can count,\u201d Lucivar replied.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s significant because . . . ?\u201d He could think of one reason for the edgy prowling. \u201cIs Marian pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucivar jumped as if he\u2019d gotten jabbed in the ass. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, no! Although she\u2019s working on it,\u201d he added in a mutter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s working on it?\u201d</p><p>Lucivar gave him a dark look. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t talked me into putting aside the contraceptive brew. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>Thank the Darkness for that. He loved his grandson, Daemonar. He really did. But he suspected everyone in the family would be grateful for a little more time before they had to deal with another miniature Lucivar.</p><p>Including Lucivar.</p><p>\u201cDid Lord Burle say anything to you about Cassidy?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cA few things. Are you interested in something in particular?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she have her moontime while he was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Saetan pressed his lips together, not sure if he was amused or appalled. He had known Andulvar Yaslana for over fifty thousand years, and even having all those years of experience with the straightforward way Eyriens had of looking at things didn\u2019t always prepare him for Lucivar\u2019s bluntness.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a delicate subject.\u201d He studied his son. \u201cYou would have asked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I would have. Even if she\u2019d had her last moontime right before she went to Dena Nehele, she\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially with some help.\u201d</p><p>Apparently Lucivar had kept a few things to himself about his last visit to Dena Nehele. Like the fact that Cassidy might feel too uneasy about being vulnerable around the males who were supposed to serve her.</p><p>\u201cHer court,\u201d Saetan said quietly. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d Lucivar replied. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure I can get things settled enough that she won\u2019t have to worry for the rest of the time she\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>Preferring to have only a vague idea of how Lucivar might settle things \u201cenough,\u201d Saetan said,\u201cIf you don\u2019t trust them, who is supposed to send a mes\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>*Yas?

Recognized that same shift by the look in Lucivar\u2019s eyes.</p><p>No, Cassidy wasn\u2019t their Queen, and she wasn\u2019t family. But she was connected to them because of Jaenelle\u2014and Daemon\u2014so they would respond in a way that was in keeping with their nature.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in four days,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>Saetan nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go to your eyrie and inform Marian.

You\u2019ll ride the Ebon-gray Wind with me.\u201d</p> <p>Saetan stared at the empty doorway a long time before saying softly, \u201cMay the Darkness have mercy on you,Theran, if you do anything in the next few days that pisses off Lucivar.\u201d</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>You can\u2019t hide in your room for the next three days, Cassie thought as she pulled a long, moss green sweater over her head. There\u2019s work to be done, and how can you prove to Theran and the others that you\u2019re capable of going out among the people if you can\u2019t even move among your own First Circle?</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hide in her room. But she wanted to. She knew what to expect from the males back home, but not here. Would they work together, or would the personalities that rubbed against one another turn savage?</p><p>No way to tell. Not from her bedroom.</p><p>Pressing a hand to her abdomen, she took a deep breath, blew it out, and left her suite.</p> <p>Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, she thought a few minutes later. The male servants she had passed on the way to her office had given her a sharp glance, but that was the only change in their behavior.</p><p>As she rounded a corner, she thought, I guess I was worried over noth\u2014</p><p>Theran drew in a breath, no doubt getting ready to \u201cask\u201d why it had taken her so long to come down when the Steward and others were waiting for her.</p><p>Then his nostrils flared. His eyes glazed. And the look in those eyes was predatory, not protective.</p><p>\u201cCassidy,\u201d Theran growled.</p><p>She took a step back. Took another. \u201cI need some air. I\u2019ll join you in the Steward\u2019s office in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassidy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need some air!\u201d</p> <p>She turned and headed for the nearest door that would take her out of the house. She almost made it, almost got the outside door open, when Ranon stormed into the room, moving with an intent that made it plain he had caught the scent and come after her.</p><p>The glazed eyes. The power and savagery. Warlord Princes rising to the killing edge and honing their tempers to lethal intensity because of a blood scent.</p><p>She knew she should direct that savagery, turn it into a fierce kind of service. She was a Queen, and dealing with a Warlord Prince when he rode the killing edge was part of her training.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d Ranon snarled, taking a step toward her.</p><p>If she trusted him, trusted any of them, she could stand her ground and find a way to keep things from turning deadly. But she looked into Ranon\u2019s eyes and realized he had taken advantage of those vulnerable days to kill witches he had hated, and right now, he was struggling not to see her as prey, not to see her as he\u2019d seen most other Queens.</p><p>One hundred Warlord Princes in Dena Nehele. For the first time, she understood what they must have done to survive, how much blood they must have spilled to keep the failing heart of their people from being destroyed completely.</p><p>\u201cI need some air,\u201d Cassidy said, easing herself out the door. \u201cTake care of your duties, Prince. I\u2019ll join you shortly.\u201d</p><p>Did he sense the lie?</p><p>Fool. You should have gone to the Keep last night when you suspected this would start.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t been frightened last night. Not really frightened. She\u2019d had a false confidence, based on her experience with the Warlord Princes in Jaenelle\u2019s court. She\u2019d never felt threatened by those men, even the most powerful among them. Hell\u2019s fire, Lucivar didn\u2019t waste time discussing anything with a witch during her moontime. He\u2019d simply pick her up and haul her to wherever he wanted her to be, and that was the end of it. If she was lucky\u2014and he was feeling generous in a snarly kind of way\u2014the witch would have a choice of what she was going to eat and whether she had one blanket tucked around her or two.</p><p>Despite his power and temper, despite what she\u2019d heard he could do when he rode the killing edge, she had never had a moment when she\u2019d thought Lucivar would hurt her.</p><p>Her thoughts fled in every direction. She kept her head down and her eyes focused on the ground as she hurried without considering where she was going. When strong hands grabbed her upper arms, she let out a breathless shriek.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d Gray asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d she gasped. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. I was just . . .\u201d</p><p>His nostrils flared. His eyes glazed. And a friend was replaced by a stranger whose hands tightened on her arms when she tried to step back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurt,\u201d Gray said, his voice roughened by a temper turned unpredictable. \u201cYou need the Healer.\u201d</p><p>He started to pull her toward the house. She dug her heels into the ground, resisting.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a Healer, Gray. I\u2019m not hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding. I can smell it.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night. \u201cIt\u2019s moon\u2019s blood, Gray. You know about moon\u2019s blood. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Did he? Boys didn\u2019t notice the smell of moon\u2019s blood until they began to mature sexually. When she\u2019d first met him, Gray\u2019s psychic scent had said \u201cboy\u201d despite his physical maturity.</p><p>\u201cI know about it,\u201d Gray finally said.</p><p>There was just enough hesitation in his voice for her to wonder if she could believe him.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out here,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou should be inside. Someone should be looking after you.\u201d</p><p>Well, he knew that much.</p><p>She thought of going back inside, thought of the look in Theran\u2019s eyes\u2014and Ranon\u2019s eyes\u2014and shuddered.</p><p>\u201cToo many people in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean too many males.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His hands gentled. His voice gentled. \u201cYou need to rest, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t deny it without lying, so she said nothing.</p><p>Gray released her, then slid a hand down her arm until he could take her hand. \u201cCome on. You can take a nap in my bed. You\u2019ll be safe there.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s little room in the shed. A quiet, private place where she could gather her wits and her courage.</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue with him when he coaxed her to lie down on the bed her father had built. She didn\u2019t argue when he removed her shoes.</p><p>She didn\u2019t resist when he tucked himself in beside her.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest, Cassie,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cYou can rest.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips gently stroked her forehead, stroked her hair. Such a soothing motion. When he told her to close her eyes, she obeyed.</p><p>Cradled by the warmth of him, she fell asleep.</p><p>Gray watched her sleep. That sunset hair, with its streaks of honey, was spread over his pillow. He studied that wonderful face with its crop of freckles. An honest face. A face he could trust.</p><p>Just like she trusted him. She hadn\u2019t stayed in the house with Theran or Ranon. She\u2019d come to him, trusted him to keep her safe.</p><p>And he would keep her safe. He\u2019d put a Purple Dusk shield around the gardening shed, as strong a shield as he could make. It wouldn\u2019t keep the other males out if they were determined to get in, but it would give him the precious moments he\u2019d need to prepare for a fight.</p><p>*Gray?*</p><p>*Leave me be,Theran.*</p><p>*Are you all right? Why have you put a shield around the shed?*</p><p>*I\u2019m fine.* More than fine. His blood was singing in his veins, potent and ripe.</p><p>*Have you seen Cassidy?*</p><p>*Leave me alone.*</p><p>When a minute passed without another call from Theran, Gray relaxed again. Turned his attention to the woman.</p><p>Cassie. His eyes focused on her neck. He bent his head as he carefully pulled her sweater away from the spot that intrigued him so much. Then he breathed in the scent of her. His lips pressed against her skin, and his tongue got the taste of her.</p><p>He raised his head and looked at her, seeing something different. Something wonderful.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>In response to the thought, a strange feeling flooded him, body, heart, and mind. A feeling fierce and powerful. A feeling that shattered the husk he\u2019d lived inside for so long\u2014and no longer wanted.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d Gray whispered. \u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips once more to that sweet spot, feeling a hunger stirring his body, arousing much more than his cock.</p><p>Smiling, he looked at her, asleep in his bed, and whispered, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Theran watched Gray and Cassidy walking toward the house, hand in hand.</p><p>\u201cThat little prick,\u201d Theran growled. \u201cHe was hiding her in the shed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we know where she was,\u201d Ranon said, rubbing the back of his neck to ease some tension.</p><p>\u201cHe could have said something,\u201d Theran snapped.</p><p>The whole household had been in a state of quiet panic since Cassidy walked out the door.</p><p>A vulnerable Queen is a dead Queen.</p><p>Even if you couldn\u2019t get the Queen the first time, you could start picking off her protectors, could get a feel for who was loyal\u2014and, therefore, a traitor to his own people\u2014and who wouldn\u2019t get in the way of the fighters trying to hold on to the little in Dena Nehele that hadn\u2019t been corrupted.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t been out in the open\u2014not like Ranon or some of the others\u2014but he\u2019d done his share of fighting. And he knew there were plenty of men out there\u2014including some of the Warlord Princes who had presented themselves for consideration\u2014who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to attack a Queen because that\u2019s what they\u2019d spent a lifetime doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs she all right?\u201d Shira asked, rushing up to them.</p><p>Theran glanced over his shoulder and swore silently. With the exception of Talon, who would surely have a few things to say when he joined them at sundown, the whole damn First Circle was there, waiting for Gray and Cassidy to take the last few steps across the terrace and enter the house.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give anyone else time to voice an opinion. As soon as Gray crossed the threshold,Theran stepped forward.</p> <p>\u201cGray, what in the name of Hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gray snarled at him, and the glazed green eyes that stared at him held no recognition.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Gray,\u201d Cassidy said quietly, trying to slip her hand out of Gray\u2019s grasp. \u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Gray tightened his grip and snarled, \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>Before Theran could respond, a sharp whistle from the back of the room caught their attention. Power and temper formed a wedge that had the rest of the men scrambling to get out of the way as Lucivar crossed the room and stopped when no one stood between him and Gray.</p> <p>\u201cMine,\u201d Gray snarled again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hear anyone challenging your claim, boyo,\u201d Lucivar said,\u201cbut there are things that need to be done, and we\u2019re going to take them in order. First.\u201d He pointed to Gray\u2019s Jewel, then his own. \u201cPurple Dusk. Ebon-gray. I have no quarrel with you. In fact, I\u2019m here to help. But if you start a pissing contest with me, I will rip you apart. Are we clear on that?\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded once, sharply.</p><p>\u201cSecond, ease up on her hand before you crack a bone.\u201d</p><p>Theran saw Gray\u2019s hand jerk open, then close again. But not as tight.</p><p>And he noticed how intensely Cassidy watched Lucivar.</p> <p>\u201cThird,\u201d Lucivar said, \u201cis the Healer present?\u201d</p><p>Since Shira was standing beside Ranon, it was obvious she was present, but she stepped forward and said, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to make moontime brews?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2014\u201d</p><p>A small sound from Cassidy.</p><p>Shira pulled back. \u201cYes, Prince,\u201d she said courteously. \u201cI\u2019m well versed in brews that can ease moontime discomfort.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar nodded, his gold eyes fixed on Gray. \u201cThe Healer will go with Lady Cassidy up to the Lady\u2019s suite. The Healer will make the brew and Lady Cassidy will have some private time to take care of personal needs. Vae will go with them. If there\u2019s anything that needs our attention,Vae will let us know. We clear so far?\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded.</p> <p>\u201cLet go, Gray,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I need to go with Shira now.\u201d</p><p>Reluctance. Resistance. Theran watched Gray struggle with conflicting instincts\u2014and knew the only reason things hadn\u2019t turned bloody was Lucivar\u2019s overpowering presence.</p><p>The moment Cassidy eased her hand out of Gray\u2019s grasp, Shira hustled her out of the room, followed by Vae.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Lucivar said to Gray. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go outside and clear your head of the blood scent enough to have your brain working again. Then you come back in, and we\u2019ll all work out an agreement for taking care of Cassidy during her moontime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a Queen,\u201d Lucivar said firmly. \u201cShe has a court. You have to share.\u201d</p><p>Gray bared his teeth and snarled at Lucivar.</p><p>Lucivar just looked at him until Gray subsided, yielding to the dominant power.</p><p>\u201cEven the sweetest-tempered witch turns bitchy during the first three days of her moontime,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cWhy should you be the only one on the receiving end of her temper? Let her court shoulder some of it. That\u2019s part of what it means to be First Circle.\u201d</p><p>Gray, don\u2019t be a fool, Theran thought. He\u2019s giving you a chance to back down. Take it!</p><p>\u201cHow much sharing?\u201d Gray asked, sounding wary.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to decide. Go on,\u201d Lucivar added gently. \u201cGet some air. The first time it matters always hits a man hard.\u201d</p><p>Theran didn\u2019t take a full breath until Gray retreated.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cWhat got into him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis temper and his balls woke up,\u201d Lucivar replied. \u201cSince they woke up about ten years late, you all need to be very careful with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cA week ago, I\u2019d say you were right,\u201d Lucivar said, giving Theran a long look. \u201cBut he\u2019s a Warlord Prince who has staked a claim. Until Cassidy accepts him or rejects him according to Protocol, he won\u2019t see you as a cousin when you\u2019re in the same room with her. He\u2019ll see you as a rival. And Grayhaven, if he believes you\u2019re trespassing, don\u2019t think for a moment he won\u2019t do his damnedest to rip your throat out.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>Lucivar walked into the sitting room at the Keep and wasn\u2019t surprised to find Daemon there as well as Saetan. His brother\u2019s presence wasn\u2019t a lack of confidence in his ability to handle himself in a potentially hostile place; it was a need for firsthand assurance that he had returned home safely.</p><p>Or maybe it was Daemon\u2019s way of letting him see that the emotional fragility had passed\u2014or, at least, had mended enough not to be the first thing he sensed about his brother. In fact, he\u2019d say Daemon had the contented feel of a man who had been well stroked last night\u2014a condition he hoped to find himself in tonight if he and Marian had enough energy left after they put the little beast to bed.</p><p>There was food on the table, so he filled a plate, accepted the coffee Daemon poured for him, and said, \u201cYoung Warlord Princes are a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>His father, the coldhearted bastard, laughed.</p><p>\u201cI could have told you that,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cDid Theran give you trouble?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cNot Theran. Gray.\u201d Seeing the same narrowing of their gold eyes, Lucivar nodded. \u201cYeah. The one who didn\u2019t leave boyhood behind after he was tortured. He\u2019s making up for it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>\u201cHe staked a claim on the Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Two voices. The same disbelief swiftly followed by thoughtful consideration. He could have used some of that thoughtful consideration over the past three days.</p><p>Comfortable with the silence, Lucivar ate the first relaxed meal he\u2019d had since he walked into the Grayhaven estate and found a situation a lot more potentially explosive than he\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>\u201cGray is twenty-seven?\u201d Saetan asked.</p><p>Lucivar nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s a couple months older than Theran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the first time he\u2019s caught the scent of moon\u2019s blood?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently. Combine that with the fact that I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s falling in love with Cassidy. . . .\u201d</p><p>Saetan sighed. \u201cNo training, no control, no one prepared for his reaction. He and Cassidy must have been alone when he caught the scent. He could have killed one of her First Circle before anyone realized he was dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI arrived at the same time he was bringing her back to the house. The First Circle was there, waiting for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about drawing a line,\u201d Daemon murmured.</p><p>\u201cI drew quite a few lines while I was there,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cAnd I convinced Gray I would hammer his cock into the ground if he crossed any of those lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassidy has a court,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Lucivar replied. \u201cSince Gray is studying the Protocol books, it wouldn\u2019t hurt if he received a note calling his attention to the parts that deal with the proper way for a Warlord Prince to stake a claim and what is considered acceptable behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cGetting a note from the High Lord should impress him enough to take the studying seriously,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>\u201cKilling his rivals isn\u2019t acceptable because it can destroy an entire community, but it isn\u2019t unexpected behavior,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cIf Gray is that aroused and attracted to Cassidy, maintaining self-control is going to be difficult if he\u2019s pushed in any way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI divided her,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cGray is courting Cassidy the woman. The First Circle serves Cassidy the Queen. Steward, Master of the Guard, and First Escort form the triangle around the Queen and always have access to her. The fact that two out of three are family made it easier. The only other male Gray could accept being around Cassidy in an informal way was a Warlord Prince of Shalador descent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy him?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>Lucivar smiled. \u201cBecause he\u2019s in love with the court\u2019s Healer and isn\u2019t interested in warming anyone else\u2019s bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar set his empty plate on the table. \u201cMaybe it would be a good idea to invite Cassidy to the Keep for dinner sometime soon, along with Theran and Gray.\u201d</p><p>Saetan raised an eyebrow. \u201cTheran because he\u2019s her First Escort, and Gray because . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I think Gray would benefit in seeing how he should conduct himself. And I\u2019m guessing right now he has questions he doesn\u2019t really want to ask anyone back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is dinner and sex primer?\u201d Daemon asked dryly.</p><p>Well, at least Daemon understood who was going to be answering most of those questions.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cI\u2019ll extend the invitation for a week from today. Will that suit both of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check with Marian,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back by then,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cSo will Jaenelle.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar let his expression ask the question.</p><p>\u201cVisits to a couple of Provinces,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cSeems my presence is required to sort out some things. Jaenelle left this morning for Dea al Mon to visit Surreal, who is feeling crowded by the amount of trees in the Territory.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Dea al Mon are called the Children of the Wood,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cIsn\u2019t hard to figure their Territory would have trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t hard to figure that the Dea al Mon\u2019s idea of a city is vastly different from Surreal\u2019s,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to stay there,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cShe can come back to the town house in Amdarh if she\u2019s happier living there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not quite ready to leave. Apparently she and Grandmammy Teele are getting along extremely well.\u201d</p><p>It took a minute before Lucivar remembered to breathe. Grandmammy Teele, as she was called, was the matriarch of a Dea al Mon clan and had adopted Jaenelle into her family before Saetan had formally adopted Witch. She wore the role of cranky old woman because she enjoyed it, but she was a force to be reckoned with\u2014not to mention a very skilled Black Widow. \u201cThat\u2019s a terrifying thought.\u201d</p><p>Saetan\u2019s gold eyes twinkled as he said dryly, \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d</p> <p>Cassidy sat back on her heels, looked over her shoulder, and wondered whom she was dealing with\u2014Gray the boy, or Gray as the man he was becoming. Since she wasn\u2019t sure, she said warily, \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you\u2019ve had enough for today?\u201d</p><p>Asking, not telling. But not a long step away from telling, and a much shorter step away from that bossy, fussy state of mind that was impossible to deal with when a Warlord Prince got stubborn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got one more annual to plant. Then I\u2019ll get cleaned up and meet with the Steward for Queen\u2019s work,\u201d Cassidy said. Which meant she would be sitting quietly for the next several hours, an activity that didn\u2019t make Warlord Princes as temperamental as physical activity did.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Gray replied.</p><p>Satisfied with each other\u2019s answers, they went back to their respective work.</p> <p>Cassidy took her time planting the last annual just to stay outside a little while longer and take in how much had been done over the past three days.</p><p>Lucivar had been a lesson in how one man could shake up a court. By the time she and Shira had joined the men, Lucivar had set down rules and boundaries that everyone had agreed to. All right, to be accurate, no one had dared to argue. Even Gray, who was clearly trying to deal with a side of his nature he\u2019d never dealt with before.</p><p>But Lucivar had done more than set boundaries. He\u2019d knocked down boundaries the other men hadn\u2019t been aware of building.</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem with sweating?\u201d Lucivar asked Ranon.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ranon replied.</p><p>\u201cThen get your ass out in the garden and help Gray. There\u2019s no danger of frost anymore, plants need to be planted, and nothing will happen until that ground is cleared. Besides, the Healer probably would like to have a little garden of her own to grow at least some of the herbs she uses for her healing brews. And since she\u2019s also a Black Widow, she\u2019d appreciate some ground to grow the plants the Hourglass finds useful. If you\u2019re going to warm the woman\u2019s bed, it\u2019s time to give her use of more than your cock.\u201d</p><p>Ranon might have been resentful about having any man say that to him if Lucivar hadn\u2019t turned around and done a lot of the work himself, using a combination of muscle and Craft to clear out the old flower beds with ruthless efficiency. He\u2019d shown the others that a Warlord Prince wasn\u2019t just a warrior\u2014and that serving meant taking care of small things that mattered and not just the big things other people thought were important.</p><p>More than that, Lucivar had been both teacher and leash for Gray, calmly meeting Gray\u2019s flashes of temper while demanding that Gray remain within the boundaries of Protocol when dealing with her or with her court. Three days with Lucivar had taught Gray a lot.</p> <p>Maybe more than she would have wanted him to learn.</p><p>Cassidy patted the soil around the last little plant, put her tools in the basket Gray had bought for her when he and Lucivar had gone to town, then frowned as she picked up the watering can.</p><p>Empty.</p><p>Easy enough to walk over to the pump and fill the can.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at Gray.</p><p>Better to ask for help.</p><p>\u201cGray? I need to get back to the house now. Could you fill the watering can and water this last plant for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Cassie,\u201d he replied, almost glowing with happy enthusiasm.</p><p>Was that happy, boyish enthusiasm at the core of Jared Blaed Grayhaven, or would it be lost during this maturing process of becoming the Warlord Prince he should have been?</p><p>She put her basket of tools away in the shed. When she turned around, Gray was blocking the doorway, and there was nothing boyish about the look in his eyes.</p><p>She walked up to him, not sure of his intentions, but certain he wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cYou kissed me,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThe day I brought you the blue river plants. Today it\u2019s my turn.\u201d</p><p>A light kiss on the lips, soft and lingering. The lightest touch of his fingers on her hair.</p><p>Delicious flutters in her belly.</p><p>He stepped back and smiled. \u201cLucivar said since we\u2019re courting, I\u2019m allowed to kiss you. But only above the shoulders. For now.\u201d</p><p>There was a different kind of flutter in her belly. \u201cDid he give you a timetable for when you can do things without him coming down on you like an avalanche?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>\u201cCassie? If you don\u2019t want me to kiss you, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Understand what?</p><p>He was younger than she, and his mind was still healing. Those were two reasons to tell him not to kiss her.</p><p>But her Consort had never given her that delicious flutter in the belly. So she gave Gray a light kiss in reply and walked out of the shed, wondering if she was asking to have her heart broken when he started seeing her the way other men did.</p><p>She stopped walking when she reached the dead honey pear tree. More than a symbol of the Grayhaven line, it had been a symbol of love.</p><p>Wondering if she would ever experience that kind of love, and remembering how Gray\u2019s kiss made her feel, she pressed her palm against the tree.</p><p>A violent snapping beneath her feet. Sharp cracks of something breaking.</p><p>She grabbed the tree for support.</p><p>It wobbled.</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d Cassie said as Gray ran up to her. \u201cLook!\u201d Putting both hands on the trunk, she pushed a little, and they both watched the tree wobble.</p><p>\u201cThe roots must have cracked,\u201d Gray said, going to the opposite side of the tree and placing his hands on it.</p><p>More snaps and cracks on his side of the tree.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to fall,\u201d Gray said. \u201cAfter all this time, it\u2019s going to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d Cassidy breathed, hardly daring to believe what was rising up from the ground around them and through the dead wood. A message that had been masked all these years. \u201cGray, there\u2019s something under the tree.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, his eyes filling with excitement. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s the treasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s supposed to be a treasure buried somewhere at Grayhaven. Lia buried it, and even Jared didn\u2019t know where, but he told his grandsons that there was a treasure that would help restore Dena Nehele when it was found. People have been searching ever since, but no one has found it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said they couldn\u2019t cut down what was left of the tree,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cAnd the ground was too hard to dig it up.\u201d</p><p>Treasure? Why would she feel it?</p><p>She eyed Gray and decided he\u2019d get too upset if she didn\u2019t tell him first. Releasing the tree, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to do something you won\u2019t like, but it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>Now he eyed her.</p><p>She kept her nails short, since it was more practical for gardening, so she called in a pocketknife, opened the blade, and sliced the tip of her little finger deep enough to have blood welling before Gray could snarl an objection.</p><p>She closed the knife and vanished it. As she pressed her hand against the tree, she said, \u201cAnd the Blood shall sing to the Blood.\u201d</p><p>Spells releasing. Realigning. Triggering other spells.</p><p>The complexity of what was under their feet staggered her.</p><p>Or maybe the staggering was simply because the texture of the ground was changing. Or because of what she sensed.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alive,\u201d she said. \u201cWhatever is under this tree is still alive.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your family, Gray,\u201d she said. \u201cIt should be your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran,\u201d Ranon said, making a \u201ccome here\u201d motion with his hand as he continued staring out an upstairs window. \u201cYou need to see this.\u201d</p><p>Joining the other Warlord Prince, Theran watched Gray and Cassidy rock the dead honey pear tree. Then he swore. \u201cWhat in the name of Hell are those two doing now?\u201d</p><p>Wood that had been impervious to ax or Craft crumbled under their hands as she and Gray used Craft to float the remains of the tree out of the way. When they set it on the ground, its own weight broke it up even more.</p><p>We\u2019ll have a nice pile of wood chips for mulch, Cassidy thought as she and Gray hurried to the shed for picks and shovels.</p><p>\u201cYou wash off that slice,\u201d Gray said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want dirt getting into it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue, since he was right. It stung when she washed it at the pump, but she made sure the slice was clean before she called in her own little jar of healing ointment and slathered some ointment on her finger before running back to the spot.</p><p>She had to put two shields around her hands and then gloves, as well as promise to let Shira see her finger, before Gray handed her one of the shovels.</p><p>\u201cThe ground has changed,\u201d Cassidy said as she started shoveling.</p><p>\u201cGood potting soil,\u201d Gray said, working swiftly but carefully.</p><p>She was so focused on the ground in front of her, she didn\u2019t notice Theran until he was almost on top of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he roared.</p><p>\u201cDigging,\u201d Gray snapped. \u201cTheran, you take the other shovel. Cassie\u2019s already done enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something buried under the tree,\u201d Cassidy said, seeing Theran\u2019s eyes blaze with fury as he looked at the crumbling tree that had been his family\u2019s symbol. \u201cSomething is alive down there.\u201d</p> <p>His face was wiped clean of everything but his fury. Then he seemed to absorb the words. \u201cAlive?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Gray hadn\u2019t stopped digging. Now Theran threw himself into it.</p><p>Cassidy looked toward the terrace and sighed when she saw Shira, Ranon, Powell, and a few others, including several servants, heading toward her to find out what was happening now.</p><p>More often than not these days, she felt like a one-woman drama society. It seemed like she never did anything without an audience.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t they use Craft to move the dirt?\u201d Shira asked.</p><p>Gray and Theran both stopped digging and looked at her.</p><p>Cassidy stared at the hole for a moment, then closed her eyes. Blood to blood. But this didn\u2019t start when she sliced her finger just now. This started when she had worked her hands bloody trying to run from the pain caused by Theran\u2019s words.</p><p>Her blood had smeared on rocks, had mixed with the soil.</p><p>A Queen\u2019s power connecting with the land.</p><p>If they tried to do this without sweat, without toil, they would find nothing worth having.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t use Craft,\u201d she said.</p><p>Theran and Gray went back to digging. The ground kept crumbling, so they had to widen the hole. Ranon got the wheelbarrow and another shovel in order to shift the dirt. Other members of the court joined them, along with servants and men from the stables.</p><p>But it was Theran and Gray who dug.</p><p>And it was Theran and Gray who found the old locked chest and dragged it out of the hole.</p><p>One blow of a shovel broke the lock. Theran opened the chest, then sat back on his heels, his face filled with disappointment.</p><p>Cassidy picked up one of the pieces and felt the preservation spells begin to break.</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone go to this much trouble to preserve some pieces of fruit?\u201d Theran said.</p><p>Because they\u2019ll grow, Cassidy thought.</p> <p>\u201cThose are honey pears,\u201d Gray said, one hand hovering over the other pieces in the chest.</p><p>\u201cNot like any I\u2019ve seen,\u201d Shira said. \u201cThere are a few orchards left on the Shalador reserves, but the trees are dying off, and the fruit is small and hard.\u201d</p><p>What grows from these will have the taste of memories.</p><p>The preservation spell suddenly broke, and the fruit in her hand felt pulpy, already decaying.</p><p>\u201cWe have to plant these now,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cGive them soil, give them care, and new orchards will come from what\u2019s in this chest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Gray said as he picked up a handful of soil. \u201cThis is perfect.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked at Gray. \u201cHurry. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much time to get them into soil once the preservation spells break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPots,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWe\u2019ll start them in pots so we can put them on the terrace, where they\u2019ll be more protected.\u201d He sprang to his feet. \u201cThere are pots in the shed.\u201d</p><p>The pear she held turned to lifeless mush.</p><p>Theran stared at it for a moment, then swore and raced to catch up to Gray, followed by Ranon and Shira.</p><p>They each ran back hugging a pot.</p><p>Cassidy stripped off her gloves and dropped the shields around her hands. She needed a connection to the soil and the pears, without barriers.</p><p>\u201cGray, you and Cassidy should do the planting,\u201d Theran said. \u201cYou both seem to have a feel for this.\u201d</p><p>What was in his voice? Cassidy wondered. Annoyance? Bitterness? It would take years for these trees to grow and bear fruit, but wasn\u2019t a living symbol better than a dead one?</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask. Didn\u2019t really care. What mattered was not wasting what someone had gone to great lengths to preserve.</p><p>Gray filled pots with soil as Cassidy held each pear at the right depth, releasing the fruits gently one by one until there was only one left in the chest that hadn\u2019t turned to mush.</p><p>\u201cOne more,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo more pots,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got twelve planted.\u201d</p><p>But there\u2019s still one left.</p><p>She ran to the shed, probably pissing him off because she didn\u2019t take his word for it, but she couldn\u2019t care about that.</p><p>Something, she thought as she searched under the potting bench and then the rest of the shed. Anything.</p><p>The jumble of broken tools in the back left corner looked like it had been rummaged through already, but she pushed things aside for another look.</p><p>And found a pot with some bad chips around the rim.</p><p>Old, she thought as she shifted it to get a better look. And smaller than the others because it was divided into two sections, but still big enough.</p><p>As she picked it up, she felt something give way at the bottom of the pot.</p><p>Damn. If it was broken at the bottom, it wouldn\u2019t be of any use.</p><p>She set it on the potting bench to get a better look at it. Then she just stared.</p><p>The small piece that broke off revealed a compartment under the pot\u2014and the corner of a yellowed piece of paper that had been placed inside.</p><p>Time was running out. She had to get this pot to Gray before the pear decayed. But even though she was certain she would feel foolish about wasting time when she saw what it was, she took those moments needed to pinch the corner of the paper and use Craft to pass the paper through the pot.</p><p>The paper had been folded to fit the compartment and bore the Grayhaven seal. And on the front, in faded ink, was written, \u201cFor the Queen.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy looked at that corner of the shed and struggled to breathe.</p><p>Spells releasing. Realigning. A jumble of old tools that never seemed to get straightened out. Had this been there all along, waiting?</p><p>For the Queen.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Cassidy whispered.</p><p>Then she heard voices shouting. She vanished the paper, grabbed the pot, and ran back to where the others waited.</p><p>No time, she thought. Or just enough.</p><p>\u201cFound this,\u201d she said, dropping to her knees next to Gray. As he started filling one-half of the pot with soil, she cradled the last honey pear before it sank into the mush of the ones that hadn\u2019t survived.</p><p>This is the one that will stay at Grayhaven, she thought as she held it gently while Gray added soil. Maybe the others will be planted in an orchard here on the estate, but this one will grow near the house.</p><p>When the last honey pear was safely planted, she sat back, tired and aching, and certain she looked like she\u2019d been rolling in the dirt. Of course,Theran and Gray looked just as dirty.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said,\u201cshould we put these pots on the terrace and then get on with our day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all need water,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWe\u2019ll put them on the terrace, and then give them a good soaking.\u201d He grinned at all the people around him. \u201cLooks like we found the treasure after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d Theran said. He turned pale as he pointed to the bottom of the pot, where the broken piece revealed the compartment.</p><p>\u201cIt was in that jumble of old stuff,\u201d Cassidy replied.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI looked there. I didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><p>You weren\u2019t supposed to find it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wishing pot,\u201d Theran said. \u201cI remember that from the stories. The pots came from Jared\u2019s family. The compartment held written messages, wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find a message?\u201d Gray asked her, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>A message preserved for centuries. Hidden for centuries. A message for the Queen.</p><p>She shook her head. After she read the message, she would decide whether to share it with the others.</p><p>Gray helped her to her feet, and the twinges in various muscles changed her mind from taking a fast shower to taking a long, hot bath. The court could wait. The paperwork could wait.</p><p>As she reached for the old pot, Theran said, \u201cI\u2019ll take that one.\u201d</p><p>Several people gave him wary looks, since his voice sounded sharp, but she looked at his eyes and ignored the voice.</p><p>That old pot matters to him. Its history. Its connection. Until the first two leaves break the soil, the pears won\u2019t be valued. But the pot matters to him.</p><p>She stepped back and smiled. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Theran took the old pot and walked back to the house. One by one the other men picked up a pot and followed him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there\u2019s anything left in there?\u201d Shira asked as she looked into the chest and made a face.</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cThe men can turn it over later just to be sure, but I think we found what we were meant to find.\u201d</p><p>Shira gave her a long, odd look. \u201cTheran\u2019s part of the family wasn\u2019t the only part that had stories handed down.\u201d</p><p>Black Widow.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t idle conversation, but she had the feeling Shira wasn\u2019t willing to share her thoughts right now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get cleaned up, and get this cleaned up before Gray starts fretting.\u201d She held up her hand.</p><p>Still giving Cassidy an odd look, Shira nodded. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll come by the healing room so I can take a look at that slice in your finger. Since you must have used Craft to keep it bleeding while you planted those pears, I imagine the wound is clean, but we shouldn\u2019t get careless about such things. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s different about now?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>Shira smiled gently. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.

Tell no one you hold the key to finding the treasure.</p><p>The Second Rule: Don\u2019t search for the treasure. Rule the people. Live your life. If you\u2019re meant to find the next piece of the puzzle, you will find it as easily as you found the pot\u2014when the time is right, and not before.</p><p>Thera is a gifted Black Widow and wove her spells extremely well. She cannot tell me for certain that the treasure will be found, only that there will be a time when it might be found\u2014a time when Dena Nehele will need it the most. Since you are reading this, that time is now.</p> <p>I wish you luck, Sister.</p><p>Arabella Ardelia, Queen of Dena Nehele</p><p>P.S. Most people call me Lia.</p><p>Cassidy folded the message carefully and vanished it before picking up the small gold key that had been inside the paper when she\u2019d first opened it yesterday.</p><p>Thank the Darkness she hadn\u2019t told anyone about finding the message in the compartment. The possibility of finding the treasure would have ended before it began.</p> <p>\u201cI have a message that has to remain a secret, and a gold key that fits an unknown lock,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cLia, could you have made it any harder?\u201d</p><p>The search wasn\u2019t meant to be hard, because she wasn\u2019t meant to search.</p><p>Rule the people. Live your life.</p><p>\u201cNeither is as easy as you might think,\u201d Cassidy muttered as she put the key in a trinket box her father had made for her years ago. \u201cYour descendant is a very stubborn, pigheaded man.\u201d</p><p>Live your life.</p><p>Her life. Not the same thing as her duties as a Queen.</p> <p>She might have to allow Theran to restrict her actions as a Queen, but it was time to reclaim her life.</p><p>When she reached the breakfast room, Ranon looked like he was about to be backed into a corner, Shira looked amused, and Theran looked wary. Powell was clearly lingering over his breakfast, and Cassidy didn\u2019t think her Steward was waiting because he needed to discuss some business with her that couldn\u2019t wait for an hour. He probably didn\u2019t want to miss today\u2019s chapter of the Grayhaven drama.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Gray?\u201d she asked. He\u2019d relaxed enough about being in the house to come in and eat with the rest of them, so she felt worry scratching her heart when he wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the terrace, explaining the facts of life to the honey pears,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>Cassidy clamped her lips together and didn\u2019t dare ask what that meant.</p><p>Shira carefully spread some jam on a piece of toast. Since it was the second one on her plate, Cassidy figured Shira was doing it simply to have something to do.</p><p>\u201cDo you play an instrument, Lady Cassidy?\u201d Shira asked.</p><p>Ranon growled in response, so the question clearly wasn\u2019t as innocent as it sounded.</p> <p>\u201cThat depends on how you define \u2018play,\u2019 \u201d Cassidy replied, quickly filling a plate and pulling out a chair next to Shira. \u201cI can read music, and I can pick out a tune on a piano. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray thinks the honey pears would enjoy having someone play music to them for a little while each day, and I think you\u2019re the only one he hasn\u2019t questioned yet about your proficiency with an instrument.\u201d</p><p>Ranon seemed to be giving his scrambled eggs a lot more attention than they required. Or deserved.</p><p>\u201cDo you play?\u201d Cassidy asked Shira.</p><p>\u201cDrums,\u201d Shira replied as Cassidy took one of her pieces of toast. \u201cToo much sound for tender seedlings-to-be.\u201d</p><p>Theran snorted.</p><p>Powell fiddled with his coffee cup but didn\u2019t try to drink\u2014and didn\u2019t look at anyone else around the table.</p><p>\u201cRanon plays the Shalador flute,\u201d Shira said brightly.</p><p>\u201cI am not going to stand out there and play music for thirteen pots of dirt,\u201d Ranon growled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard a Shalador flute,\u201d Cassidy said\u2014and watched the color drain from his face as he realized playing for the pear trees really wasn\u2019t his choice to make.</p><p>\u201cWhenever it gives the Lady pleasure,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>Either that phrase had remained in the training, or Ranon had been studying the books of Protocol.</p><p>Live your life.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of music,Theran,\u201d Cassidy began, noticing the way his body jerked and the wary look he gave her,\u201cI\u2019m planning to attend the outdoor concert. I heard this was a weekly event in the town. You and the Master of the Guard may take whatever precautions you feel necessary, but this isn\u2019t a formal visit by the Queen, so discretion is preferred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Theran said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy pushed her plate away and locked her fingers together. \u201cPrince, I\u2019m not talking about visiting a Province that is still recovering from all the things that have caused upheaval in this Territory. I\u2019m talking about spending a few hours in what amounts to the home village. Grayhaven is the town connected with this estate. It grew up around this estate. This is the place where I\u2019ll do my personal shopping, attend the theater and concerts. This is the town where I live. If I\u2019m not safe here, I\u2019m not safe anywhere. If you can\u2019t relent enough for me to informally meet the people in this one town, then my being here is nothing more than a fool\u2019s dream. On both our parts,\u201d she finished softly.</p><p>Theran looked shaken\u2014and even more wary.</p><p>She intended to visit the town. She couldn\u2019t spend the rest of the year confined to this estate.</p><p>Now there was a bitterness in his face\u2014a look that was, sadly, becoming too familiar.</p><p>He called in an envelope and slid it across the table. \u201cThat came for you this morning.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure she recognized the writing until she turned the envelope over and saw the SaDiablo seal pressed into the black wax. Feeling a flash of concern that the High Lord might be writing to tell her bad news about her family, she relaxed when she opened the envelope and realized what she held.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an invitation,\u201d she said, smiling in anticipation. As she absorbed the significance of the phrasing, a trickle of worry began to seep in. \u201cYou, Gray, and I are invited to dine at the Keep.\u201d</p><p>Theran clenched his hands. The muscles in his tightened jaw twitched. \u201cInvitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore or less.\u201d She held out the invitation so he could read it.</p><p>He hesitated, then took the invitation and read it. And relaxed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t convenient to go.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s afraid, she thought. And if he\u2019s afraid of spending an evening with those men, how will Gray react?</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t as simple as Theran seemed to think.</p><p>\u201cLook at the phrasing,Theran,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>He read it again, and she saw no understanding in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere is only one correct response to an invitation like this when it is made by someone like the High Lord,\u201d she said.</p><p>He understood her then. \u201cBut . . . Gray.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThat has been taken into account. Lady Angelline being the kind of Healer she is . . . Believe me, that has been taken into account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo choice, then,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen going to the town and hearing some of our music would be a good idea,\u201d Shira said, her voice sounding far more confident than the look in her eyes. \u201cIt will give you all something to talk about.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 21</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Daemon glided through the Hall\u2019s corridors, a vessel for the cold, silent fury that held a single thought: how many of these bitches would he need to kill before the rest of them finally learned to leave him alone?</p><p>The silence held until he reached his suite. Then he slammed the door, letting temper and Craft enhance the sound until it thundered through the Hall, warning everyone of what they faced if anyone dared disturb him.</p><p>Moments after that came the knock on the door between his bedroom and Jaenelle\u2019s.</p><p>He ignored it, so moments after that, Jaenelle opened the door just enough to stick her head in the room.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou do not want to step into this room,\u201d he snarled, knowing his eyes were glazed and his temper was lethal.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter if she wanted to enter his room or not. He didn\u2019t want her there. Not now.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer the question,\u201d she said.</p><p>She pushed the door all the way open but stayed on her side of the threshold, which infuriated him even more. Especially because she was wearing one of his white silk shirts over a pair of slim black trousers\u2014and her feet were deliciously bare, revealing toenails painted an enticing rose color.</p><p>The only reason she painted her toenails was that he enjoyed seeing them that way\u2014and since she did it rarely, it never failed to catch his attention.</p><p>She must have painted them as a \u201cwelcome home\u201d surprise for him, which only stoked his fury. Warlord Princes were passionately violent and violently passionate. Trouble was, he was spinning between violence and passion too fast to know which emotion would dominate if anyone gave him the slightest push.</p><p>He wanted to pounce on her. He just didn\u2019t know which kind of pouncing he wanted to do. Which was her fault, actually, because she\u2019d painted her damn toenails, but it was clearly Jaenelle the Healer rather than Jaenelle the Wife who was studying him.</p><p>And because he knew why the Healer would be asking the question, he let his temper slip the leash for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sick, I\u2019m not damaged, and as sure as the sun doesn\u2019t shine in Hell, I\u2019m not feeling fragile in any damn way,\u201d he roared. \u201cWhat I am feeling is angry. So leave. Me. Alone.\u201d</p><p>Those sapphire eyes stared at him. Stared through him.</p><p>She stepped into the room.</p><p>Not sure if he was acting on temper or sheer possessiveness, he slapped a Black shield around the room, sealing her in with him.</p><p>If she noticed, she didn\u2019t react. She just took another step toward him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re riding a lot of temper, Prince,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cBut something was the cause of that temper, and that something is going to be dealt with one way or the other. If we have to work through all the temper first, so be it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hot. Cold. One moment he was Daemon, feeling furious and cornered; the next he was the Sadist, wanting to step up for this dance. And, oh, how he wanted to dance!</p><p>That particular truth scared him enough to be furious with her, so he dropped the Black shield and punched up his temper for the kind of fight that would get her angry enough to storm out of the room. Which would be the safest thing for both of them.</p><p>Turning his back on her, he removed his black jacket.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in this room right now,\u201d he said in the cold, brutally dismissive voice that used to flay women\u2019s feelings so successfully.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Her tone was so snippy, he saw the room through a red haze and stopped thinking.</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t defend yourself against what I am!\u201dAs he said the words, he swung the jacket at her, intending to smack her with it and prove that she shouldn\u2019t be in a room with him when his temper was barely chained.</p><p>Her right hand lashed out.</p> <p>Hell\u2019s fire.</p><p>Daemon stared at the slices that went all the way through the back of the jacket. He flicked a look at her right hand. Had he really seen claws instead of fingernails for just that moment when she lashed out?</p><p>\u201cTell me again I can\u2019t defend myself,\u201d she said too softly.</p><p>Not while he still wanted to live.</p><p>His temper fizzled and a giddy joy filled him as he acknowledged that truth.</p><p>It was completely ruined, but he hung the jacket on the clothes stand to have something to do.</p> <p>Mother Night, those claws were impressive. She was impressive. And such a vital, needed part of his life.</p><p>How could some bitch think a few superficial tricks could make her a substitute for Jaenelle?</p><p>That thought brought his temper roaring back to a cold, deadly edge.</p><p>Which his Lady recognized\u2014and chose to ignore.</p><p>\u201cYou went to visit two of the Province Queens,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cYou came home a day early and furious. What happened?\u201d</p><p>He vented some of his temper in sheer volume. \u201cThis evening when I walked into my room at Lady Rhea\u2019s house, that bitch Vulchera was wearing one of my shirts!\u201d</p><p>There was a look in her eyes he\u2019d never seen before, a kind of pissed-off incredulity.</p><p>\u201cWhen in the name of Hell did you get so damn possessive about a shirt?\u201d she yelled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me wearing one of your precious shirts, say so. Or have Jazen tell me, since he seems to be just as possessive of anything that resides in your closet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>She ripped open the shirt, sending the buttons flying. Stripping it off, she scrunched it up and threw it behind her.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what she was wearing under the shirt, except that it was a combination of sheer fabric and lace that veiled her nipples without hiding them.</p><p>His mouth watered, and his mind went wonderfully blank of everything that didn\u2019t concern having their two bodies come together in particularly delicious ways.</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d</p><p>Which was a problem, since he\u2019d finally managed to get her well and truly angry with him.</p><p>You started this fight, old son, so pay attention.</p><p>Besides, the sooner he figured out a way to end the fight, the sooner he could apologize for being an ass and they could put all that energy and emotion to better use.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with some basic truths, Prince,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>He winced at her tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful man, Daemon. It\u2019s more than your face. It\u2019s the way you move, and the timbre of your voice, and the sexual heat that comes off you even when you\u2019ve got it leashed. All of those things are part of what you are. And women are going to be drawn to you because of it. Hell\u2019s fire, I was drawn to you because of those things. I still am, you ass.\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched, trying to smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t deny that the times when you walk into the bedroom wearing leather pants and nothing else, you aren\u2019t looking for the reaction you get.\u201d</p><p>Just remembering her reaction was making him hard. Harder.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t deny it.\u201d His voice turned husky, almost a purr.</p><p>\u201cA lot of women are going to want the body they see. Some of those women will also want the man who lives inside it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man they think lives inside it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d She sighed, and the sound made him hopeful she was shaking off the anger. \u201cAaron runs into the same problem on occasion when he\u2019s an overnight guest, especially when Kalush isn\u2019t with him. I don\u2019t know what to tell him either, except to make his refusal so embarrassingly public the woman won\u2019t dare go near him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that,\u201d Daemon said, looking away. \u201cNot all of it anyway.\u201d His fury returned, but he worked to keep it leashed. \u201cVulchera is a woman, not a girl, and can\u2019t use the excuse of being young for being stupid. She\u2019s a trusted friend of Rhea\u2019s, so she was among the aristos Rhea had invited to provide conversation and company after she and I reviewed the business I was there to review.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there any business?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cSome. Anyway,Vulchera\u2019s flirting was too pointed and obvious from the moment we were introduced\u2014and not the friendly kind of flirting your coven indulges in that\u2019s meant to be nothing more than fun. Your friends taught me that there are ways a woman can flirt with a man that lets him know he\u2019s safe.\u201d He slipped his hands in his pockets. \u201cThis woman wasn\u2019t interested in doing anything that was safe, and she certainly wasn\u2019t interested in my reputation or my feelings. She used the same scented soap that you had purchased the last time we visited Lady Rhea\u2019s court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an exclusive soap or an exclusive scent. It\u2019s not even exclusive to the shops in that Province.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVulchera wasn\u2019t wearing that scent the first day,\u201d Daemon said softly. \u201cSince we were at Rhea\u2019s country home, there was only one shop that carried items suited for an aristo purse. She paid one of the clerks to find out what scent you used.\u201d And he intended to have a little chat with that fool very, very soon.</p><p>\u201cAnd then she put on one of your shirts,\u201d Jaenelle said, nodding as if she understood.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t. \u201cDo you know how I feel when I see you wearing one of my shirts?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you understand how aroused it makes me, how much possessive pleasure it gives me? Because of who you are, when you wear one of my shirts, you\u2019re telling the whole household that you\u2019re mine. And more than that, that I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel surrounded by you,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cComfortable. Safe. Loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd aroused?\u201d he asked just as quietly.</p><p>\u201cOnly if I picture you wearing it,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Her answer made him smile\u2014and smoothed some of the jagged edges inside him.</p><p>\u201cWell, this bitch did understand. Before we got through dinner that first evening, she realized I wouldn\u2019t invite her to my bed or accept an invitation to hers. So she used a scent I associated with you, put on a piece of clothing that would carry my own scent. She wanted me to pretend she was you. She wanted me to believe she could be a substitute for you.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle studied him. \u201cSo you were insulted on my behalf?\u201d</p><p>Rage flashed through him before he got it back under control. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>For the first time since she walked into the room, she looked wary. With good reason. He might overlook an insult aimed at himself, but he would never tolerate an insult aimed at her.</p><p>\u201cIs she still alive?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive.\u201d The Sadist smiled a cold, cruel smile. \u201cBut I did inform her that the next time she tried to seduce a married man, she would lose all feeling between her legs, guaranteeing a total lack of pleasure and no possibility of climax until the spell ran its course.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle swallowed hard. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix months for every married man she had tried to seduce, and a year for every one she had successfully seduced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan . . . can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spell is already in place.\u201d</p><p>She looked stunned. \u201cMother Night.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer. Slipped a finger under a strap of that whatever she was wearing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Vulchera anymore,\u201d he crooned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about her. Not her.\u201d</p><p>He knew his eyes were glazed, knew which side of himself wanted to play.</p><p>And so did Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cStay with me tonight,\u201d the Sadist purred. \u201cHere. In this room. Let me play with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . wh-what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>The stutter pleased him. So did the nerves.</p><p>\u201cLeave this on. I find it intriguing. With it, I want you to wear one of my shirts and those sheer white stockings. Nothing else.\u201d</p><p>She made a small sound. Might have been a whimper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to plump up the pillows and make myself comfortable. You\u2019re going to straddle me. Sheathe me. And then, my darling, I am going to make you stay perfectly still. I\u2019m not going to let you touch me in any way except to give me sweet kisses while I enjoy touching you. I\u2019m going to play with you, lover. I promise I\u2019ll be very, very gentle, and by the time I\u2019m through, I\u2019ll make you very, very happy.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were glassy, and she looked dazed by the force of sexual heat now surrounding her.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go into the bathroom and get ready?\u201d he said, taking a step back.</p><p>He hardly dared to breathe until she closed the bathroom door.</p><p>He wanted her desperately at that moment, but he knew what he was asking, knew what he was going to do. He had to give her enough time to think clearly and decide if she was willing to play.</p><p>He took off his shoes and socks, removed his belt. He pulled back the covers, plumped the pillows into a mound, and reclined against them, waiting.</p><p>The Sadist as lover.</p><p>Oh, yes. He wanted to play. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she came out of the bathroom dressed exactly as he\u2019d requested, he knew in a way he hadn\u2019t before that there was no part of him she feared\u2014and that was the most arousing thing about her.</p><p>He was pleasure and trust\u2014even as the Sadist.</p><p>When she climbed onto the bed and straddled him, he caught the scents of nerves and excitement.

And sad. \u201cWon\u2019t know for a while yet if anything will want to grow.\u201d</p><p>You didn\u2019t sound this discouraged when you found the things. And what does \u201cif anything will want to grow\u201d mean?</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Theran asked. \u201cAre you worried about going to the Keep for dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t Gray be worried? He was worried. They wouldn\u2019t be dealing with either the High Lord or Yaslana or Sadi; they\u2019d be dealing with all three. As far as he was concerned, those were three good reasons for having nightmares.</p><p>At least this dinner had been the leverage he\u2019d needed to stop Cassidy from going into town for the outdoor concert. She\u2019d been disappointed\u2014and unhappy with him\u2014but she had accepted his \u201crequest\u201d that she remain at the estate and not take risks.</p><p>The Darkness only knew what sort of excuse he could find the next time she wanted to expose herself to the Dena Nehele people.</p> <p>\u201cCassie doesn\u2019t want to plant the seeds she brought from Dharo,\u201d Gray said quietly, keeping his eyes fixed on the pot in front of him. \u201cWhen I asked her this morning why she hadn\u2019t picked out a spot in the garden for them, she said maybe it would be a mistake to plant them, that maybe things that aren\u2019t from Dena Nehele shouldn\u2019t be trying to put down roots here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d Theran said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want our own plants pushed out because something else was brought into our land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t talking about the plants,\u201d Gray said. \u201cNot really.\u201d He sighed and looked at Theran. \u201cI love you, Theran, and I am grateful for the way you\u2019ve taken care of me these past years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be grateful for,\u201d Theran grumbled. \u201cWe\u2019re family.\u201d And you wouldn\u2019t have needed that care if you hadn\u2019t been protecting me.</p><p>\u201cWhen Cassie goes back to Dharo, I\u2019m going with her.\u201d</p><p>The words shocked him. Chilled him. Showed him a potential loss that wasn\u2019t about a physical distance separating them.</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d he breathed. \u201cGray, this is your home. Here. In Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s anything here for her. She doesn\u2019t think she can put down roots and make a life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about going to Dharo,\u201d Theran argued. \u201cAbout going to Kaeleer.\u201d</p><p>Gray nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it all morning, after she said that about not putting down roots.\u201d He shifted so he was sitting on the flagstones. \u201cIf Cassie doesn\u2019t belong here because her bloodlines began in a different place, do we belong here,Theran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you belong here because you have the Grayhaven bloodline, but I\u2019m wondering about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Gray. Do I need to show you a map and point out the village where you were born? A village that\u2019s in Dena Nehele?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t begin there,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI can trace my bloodline to Thera and Blaed on my mother\u2019s side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I,\u201d Theran snapped. \u201cOur mothers were sisters, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThera and Blaed came over the Tamanara Mountains with Lia and settled in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo serve Lia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey put down roots, made a life for themselves here, but they didn\u2019t come from Dena Nehele. Neither did Jared. He came from Shalador. And his people, the ones who came over the mountains to escape the destruction of their Territory . . . Did enough Shalador blood get spilled defending Dena Nehele to entitle the survivors to put down roots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray . . .\u201d The thought staggered him\u2014and made him wonder how Ranon would respond to that question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be going with her,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIf she\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never heard his cousin talk like this. \u201cWhat would you do in Dharo?\u201d</p><p>Gray shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll find work. Maybe I could work for Cassie\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>A Purple Dusk Warlord Prince working for a Warlord who wore Tiger Eye? What was Gray thinking?</p><p>If he was thinking.</p><p>If any part of this was actually Gray\u2019s idea.</p><p>Was Cassidy using Gray as a pawn in some kind of game? Wouldn\u2019t be the first time a Queen had used one man in order to chain another.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Theran said, rising, \u201cthere\u2019s plenty of time to think about all this. Right now, we both need to get cleaned up and properly dressed. For Cassidy\u2019s sake, we want to make a good impression.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s eyes flashed with temper, turning a familiar face into a stranger\u2019s. Then the temper faded, and the man looking at him was more like the boy Theran had known during these ten years since Talon rescued Gray.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gray said, \u201cwe want to make a good impression.\u201d</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>Settling on the arm of the sofa, Saetan crossed his arms as he studied his daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re looking for, witch-child,\u201d he said. He\u2019d listened to Jaenelle\u2019s account of Daemon\u2019s return from the visit to Lady Rhea\u2019s country house, and he heard the concern in her voice. Since he\u2019d already heard Daemon\u2019s report about the incident, he didn\u2019t understand why she was concerned.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t hurt, and Daemon wasn\u2019t hurt,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think his . . . punishment . . . is a bit harsh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, I think it showed a remarkable amount of self-control.\u201d Maybe too much self-control.</p><p>She frowned at him, and he suppressed a sigh of annoyance.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d Saetan asked. \u201cDo I think Daemon is entitled to his fury? I certainly do. Do I think his punishment was just? I\u2019ve already said so. In fact, his solution probably will do nothing more than buy a little time for him to confirm what he already suspects about Rhea\u2019s friend. I doubt she\u2019ll live all that much longer. If Daemon doesn\u2019t kill her, another Warlord Prince will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that he\u2019s uneasy about another woman being so attracted to him that she acts foolishly, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off the blinders, Jaenelle,\u201d Saetan snapped. \u201cYou\u2019re being obtuse about this because it\u2019s you and Daemon, and because of how he responded last spring when that witch tried to eliminate you in order to have him. But if Lucivar had found another woman in his bed, trying to play this particular game, and had shrugged the incident off instead of doing something about her, you would have pinned him to a wall, either as his Queen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormer Queen,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201c\u2014or as his sister. And before you use \u2018former\u2019 in front of \u2018Queen\u2019 again, Lady, I suggest you review what the term \u2018life-time contract\u2019 means.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. Shifted her weight from one hip to the other. Frowned at him. \u201cYou\u2019re really feeling pissy about this.\u201d</p><p>Insulted because the word \u201cpissy\u201d dismissed his feelings in a way he wouldn\u2019t tolerate, he let his temper slip from its sheath, sharp and lethal. He pushed away from the sofa, allowing himself one slash of power to relieve some of the rage.</p><p>Jaenelle pressed her lips together and studied the pile of ash that, moments before, had been a sofa.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, High Lord,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cPlease tell me what I\u2019m not seeing.\u201d</p><p>The formality of the words no longer made this discussion personal. He appreciated that. He didn\u2019t want to fight with his daughter, but he was more than willing to enlighten his Queen.</p><p>\u201cFirst,\u201d he said as he prowled in front of the destroyed sofa, \u201cyou\u2019re forgetting that when Daemon was a pleasure slave, the kind of gathering Rhea had arranged at her country house had been his hunting ground. Better than anyone else there, he would have recognized another hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunter.\u201d She didn\u2019t make it a question, which could be interpreted as doubt, but her tone asked for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cIndulge me for a moment in a possible scenario.\u201d Saetan waited for her nod of consent. \u201cDaemon walks into his room at the Province Queen\u2019s country house and finds a woman waiting for him, a woman who has been openly flirting with him and now indicates that she wants the kind of attention a married man reserves for his wife. He demands that she leave, and she does, wearing his shirt. A month later, a package arrives at the Hall, addressed in such a way that you\u2019re the most likely person to open it, even though it\u2019s not blatantly aimed at you. And inside the package is your husband\u2019s shirt, smelling of another woman\u2019s perfume. Smelling of another woman. And there\u2019s a note, carefully phrased, that says something like \u2018Hope your wife didn\u2019t notice that a shirt was missing.\u2019 What would you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince she was clearly trying to hurt my husband by sending that package, I would find her, and we would have a little chat.\u201d</p><p>A razored chill in her voice. A look in her sapphire eyes.</p><p>Yes, she and the woman who sent that package would have a little chat\u2014and the webs Jaenelle would weave around the bitch would be a far more terrifying punishment than the physical penalty Daemon had devised.</p><p>And that, Saetan realized, was the reason Jaenelle didn\u2019t understand. She knew the depth of Daemon\u2019s loyalty, so she would react as though he was under attack and move to defend her husband\u2014in the same way she had always responded whenever she thought her father was under attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Remembering how she responded to attacks on her family, he pulled back. Chained his own temper as he considered the best way to explain.</p><p>\u201cAlthough,\u201d Jaenelle added thoughtfully, \u201cI suppose another woman would either file a complaint with the Province Queen or the District Queen who ruled her hometown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some of the men would have filed a complaint as soon as they got home, especially if they felt vulnerable because they had young children, and a charge of infidelity could end with paternity being denied at their children\u2019s Birthright Ceremony.\u201d Saetan shook his head. \u201cI think once Daemon begins making discreet inquiries about that Lady\u2019s activities, he\u2019ll find that a number of complaints had been submitted\u2014but were somehow lost before they reached someone with enough power or authority to make the woman\u2019s activities public.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think this was about Daemon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about Daemon\u2014and it wasn\u2019t about you. Not this time. Oh, I think she would have enjoyed the opportunity to bed him\u2014which only proves she\u2019s an arrogant fool\u2014but I think she was more interested in having the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan owing her for her silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. Blackmail.\u201d</p><p>Saetan nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s not the first to play this game. She won\u2019t be the last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know about her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThings can always be hidden, witch-child. The ruler of a Territory depends on the integrity of the Province Queens and District Queens to keep the land and the people in balance. If I\u2019d known about this bitch, she wouldn\u2019t still be among the living.\u201d</p><p>A memory. A flash of thought that made him wonder if he had known about her.</p><p>He locked that thought away until he could consider it in private.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens now?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cThat will be for Daemon to decide,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cThe real question now isn\u2019t about the witch who likes to play this game. The real question is whether Lady Rhea was aware of the game. Did she know what her friend was doing at these house parties? If she did, her silence was tacit approval. Even if she didn\u2019t know, even if she disposed of the complaints because she didn\u2019t believe they could be true . . . Well, everything has a price.\u201d</p><p>As he came abreast of her, he stopped his prowling.</p> <p>\u201cDaemon is going to ask Rhea to dissolve her court and step down,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t the rest of the Queens and their courts wonder why she\u2019s stepping down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe rules Dhemlan, witch-child, and he wears a Black Jewel,\u201d Saetan replied dryly. \u201cI doubt anyone is going to ask.\u201d</p><p>Obviously there were a few things Daemon left out when he\u2019d told Jaenelle about this incident. Like the fact that Rhea had pissed herself when Daemon exploded into the drawing room. His rage and his opinion of her friend left no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that Prince Sadi now viewed Lady Rhea and her friend as enemies.</p><p>\u201cI imagine Daemon was quite upset when he arrived home,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d Jaenelle replied, sounding vague.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right between you?\u201d He hadn\u2019t seen any signs of distress or sensed any distance between Daemon and Jaenelle when they arrived at the Keep. But Daemon had side-stepped questions about what had happened after he told Jaenelle about this incident. Not that it was any of his business, but . . . Hell\u2019s fire. They were his children, so he was damn well going to make it his business. \u201cDid you work things out?\u201d</p> <p>Jaenelle\u2019s face blazed with color, and she looked everywhere but at him.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cYeah. We worked things out pretty well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d he said faintly. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t make it his business after all.</p><p>He cleared his throat to find his voice. \u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t we join the rest of the family? Our guests should be arriving anytime now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t that be fun?\u201d</p><p>Not sure how to judge the words, he simply guided her to the door, and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about fun, but it should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar was waiting for them when they stepped through the Gate that brought them from the Keep in Terreille to the Keep in Kaeleer.</p><p>Theran wasn\u2019t sure if that was because Lucivar knew all of them or because he was probably considered the least dangerous of the three men who were waiting to pass judgment on him and Gray and, possibly, all of Dena Nehele.</p><p>\u201cLady Cassidy,\u201d Lucivar said, tipping his head in the slight bow that indicated respect from someone of his rank.</p><p>\u201cPrince Yaslana,\u201d Cassidy replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to be here.\u201d</p><p>For you, maybe, Theran thought. He expected to dance around questions that were no one\u2019s business, and since he wasn\u2019t there by choice, he didn\u2019t expect any part of this evening to be a pleasure.</p><p>Lucivar gaveTheran and Gray a nod of greeting,then said,\u201cWhy don\u2019t we join the others and take care of all the introductions?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy smiled as she placed her left hand on top of Lucivar\u2019s right, accepting his offer of escort. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing Jaenelle again. There are a couple of things I\u2019d like to talk to her about.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle, Theran thought as he and Gray followed Lucivar and Cassidy. Not Lady Angelline. Jaenelle.</p><p>An unintentional reminder that Cassidy knew the Queen who had ruled Ebon Askavi well enough to address her casually. Should he warn Gray about who\u2014and what\u2014Jaenelle Angelline had been?</p><p>When Lucivar opened the sitting room door, Theran still hadn\u2019t decided how much to tell Gray about the people they were going to see. Then it was too late to decide because as the people in the room turned to greet the newcomers, Gray rushed toward the golden-haired woman standing next to Daemon Sadi and stopped when he got close enough to touch her. His face was filled with awed delight, and he looked at her as if he\u2019d spent his life in a desert and she was the pool of water he\u2019d searched for.</p><p>\u201cLadies, this is Prince Jared Blaed Grayhaven and Prince Theran Grayhaven,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cGentlemen, this is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queen,\u201d Gray said, sounding a little breathless as he stared at Jaenelle.</p><p>Jaenelle smiled. \u201cI was the Queen. Now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still the Queen.\u201d</p><p>Three male voices, each sounding equally annoyed.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019m Daemon\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lady honors me,\u201d Daemon purred.</p><p>Oh, the look on Gray\u2019s face. The look in his eyes as he gave Daemon, Lucivar, and the High Lord an assessing glance before focusing on Jaenelle.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Gray said. The words sounded sincere. The tone said he was siding with the other males.</p><p>Jaenelle studied Gray through narrowed eyes. Then she shook her head and sighed. \u201cWhy do I bother arguing with any male from your caste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s entertaining?\u201d Lucivar replied.</p><p>\u201cBefore we throw our guests into the family game of \u2018snap and snarl,\u2019 why doesn\u2019t someone finish the introductions?\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>The Eyrien woman standing near the High Lord clapped a hand over her mouth to try to muffle her laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a perfect description of some of these discussions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman who finds me amusing is my wife, Marian,\u201d Lucivar said.</p><p>This Purple Dusk-Jeweled witch was married to Yaslana? How did she survive?</p><p>As soon as the introductions were made, Jaenelle said,\u201cIf you gentlemen will excuse us, Marian and I would like some time for a private chat with Cassidy before dinner.\u201d</p><p>Leaving him and Gray alone with Lucivar, Daemon, and the High Lord. Could the evening get any worse?</p><p>Of course it could. If Cassidy complained about him, Marian and Jaenelle would tell their husbands, and the odds of his surviving long enough to get home . . .</p><p>Who was he kidding? If eitherYaslana or Sadi turned on him, he had no chance of surviving.</p><p>A bottle of wine was opened and glasses were filled. As everyone else settled comfortably, Theran braced himself for the interrogation about Dena Nehele and Cassidy\u2019s court.</p><p>If they intended to question him, they never got the chance because Gray blurted out, \u201cCassie doesn\u2019t want to put down roots.\u201d</p><p>Something quiet, terrible, and predatory filled the room. Something he\u2019d never felt anyplace else or in anyone else\u2014not even Talon, who was the darkest-Jeweled male back home.</p><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d Saetan said softly.</p><p>\u201cShe brought seeds from her mother\u2019s garden,\u201d Gray said, \u201cbut she doesn\u2019t want to plant them, doesn\u2019t want them to grow in Dena Nehele soil.\u201d</p><p>A moment\u2019s silence as that terrible feeling faded from the room. Then Daemon said, \u201cThat\u2019s a prudent decision, Gray. Windblown seeds could spread for miles.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked stricken, and Theran wanted to erase Daemon\u2019s words, even though he\u2019d basically said the same thing earlier that day.</p><p>\u201cWhat about bulbs?\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cSomething that could be contained in pots? Marian does that in her garden when she wants a particular plant but wants to control where it grows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does Jaenelle,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly a possibility,\u201d Saetan agreed. \u201cBut perhaps finding common ground would be a better idea for this first year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommon ground?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cFor example, some form of daisy grows in most of the Territories in Kaeleer,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cIf you put them all together, you\u2019ll notice differences, but if someone saw one growing in its own soil, it would be recognized as \u2018daisy.\u2019 Maybe you should see what plants are native to Dena Nehele that would look similar to the seeds Cassie brought with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA flower bed like that would remind her of Dharo but still belong to the place she now calls home,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the plants look like,\u201d Gray said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWrite to Lord Burle,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cAsk him for descriptions of the plants that come from the seeds Cassie brought with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know about gardens,\u201d Gray protested. \u201cHe told me that when he was in Dena Nehele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a wife who knows about gardens,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cA wife who will remember exactly what seeds she gave her daughter.

I don\u2019t know this man who is sitting there chatting with the High Lord of Hell as if he did it every week.</p><p>\u201cAdd your note to the next batch of reports that are sent to me,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cI\u2019ll see that it gets to Lord Burle in Dharo.\u201d</p> <p>Gray smiled. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll write it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Theran cast about for something to say, but he wasn\u2019t comfortable around those men, didn\u2019t want to share anything with them that he didn\u2019t have to share.</p><p>\u201cI have scars,\u201d Gray said quietly, his eyes fixed on the carpet between his feet.</p><p>Another of those strange silences, as if Saetan, Daemon, and Lucivar were hearing more than words.</p><p>\u201cHas Cassie seen them?\u201d Saetan asked gently.</p><p>\u201cSome of them,\u201d Gray mumbled.</p> <p>\u201cDo any of them interfere with your ability to have sex?\u201d</p><p>Gray blushed and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWell, then . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have scars.\u201d</p><p>The pain in those words ripped at Theran\u2019s heart.</p><p>Another beat of silence.</p><p>\u201cIf you kiss a girl the right way, she won\u2019t notice the scars,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cThe right way?\u201d Gray slowly lifted his head. \u201cThere\u2019s a right way?\u201d</p> <p>Daemon smiled.</p><p>Gray stared at Lucivar, and there was a hint of challenge in his voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me there was a right way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in the first stage of courtship,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cBeginner kisses. As long as you don\u2019t drool on the girl or chew her face, you\u2019re doing fine.\u201d</p><p>Saetan and Daemon made pained sounds.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cLet him figure it out for himself. He\u2019s not kissing her below the neck\u2014or he shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Gray said hotly. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss technique later,\u201d Daemon said quietly.</p><p>Gray swallowed whatever he\u2019d been about to say and sat back.</p><p>\u201cOh, the joy of dealing with young men,\u201d Saetan said dryly as he looked toward the sitting room door. \u201cThank the Darkness, I think the Ladies are returning.\u201d</p><p>Theran rose to his feet with the rest of the men, feeling awkward, exposed. Gray had been the one dumping intimate worries in front of men he barely knew, but Theran felt as if he had been stripped naked as well.</p><p>Then Cassidy walked into the room between Jaenelle and Marian\u2014and Gray gasped and rushed over to her, knocking Theran out of the way.</p><p>Gray clamped his hands on either side of Cassidy\u2019s face, his expression horrified.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her face?\u201d His voice began rising to that desperate keening. \u201cWhere is her face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d Cassidy said, \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS HER FACE?\u201d</p><p>Saetan and Daemon grabbed Gray\u2019s wrists, trying to pull his hands away from Cassidy\u2019s face.</p><p>Theran leaped toward them, wanting to stop them before Gray got hurt, but Lucivar grabbed his arm and yanked him back.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Gray,\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cWHERE IS HER FACE?\u201d</p><p>Saetan snapped out a sentence that sounded like a command. Theran didn\u2019t recognize the language Saetan spoke, but the tone was sharp, commanding, and angry\u2014and Jaenelle jerked back as if she\u2019d been slapped.</p><p>A moment later, Gray\u2019s keening changed to gasping sobs as he smiled and said, \u201cThere it is. There\u2019s her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cCome with me now. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Seeing naked fear on Gray\u2019s face, Theran tried to shake off Lucivar\u2019s hold on his arm\u2014and almost got yanked off his feet.</p><p>\u201cJared.\u201d</p><p>Green eyes stared into gold. Gray\u2019s hands relaxed and were gently drawn away from Cassidy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Saetan said, still holding one of Gray\u2019s wrists while wrapping his other arm around Gray\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWe won\u2019t leave the room. We\u2019ll just go over there so we can talk for a minute.\u201d</p><p>At first there was that audible hitch in Gray\u2019s breathing, the prelude to one of his bouts of mindless terror. Then the breathing evened out. Looking beaten, he let Saetan lead him to another part of the room.</p><p>This time when Theran tried to shake Lucivar off, the Eyrien let him go. Sadi was between him and where the High Lord was talking to Gray, and he wasn\u2019t foolish enough to think Daemon would let him interfere with the discussion.</p><p>\u201cIt was just an illusion spell,\u201d Cassidy said, sounding shaken. \u201cTo hide the freckles.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t noticed, hadn\u2019t seen anything different about her. The room wasn\u2019t brightly lit. How in the name of Hell had Gray seen the difference halfway across the room?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jaenelle said, looking at Daemon. \u201cIt never occurred to me that it would upset him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your fault,\u201d Daemon replied. \u201cBut I think Gray does better with changes when he has plenty of warning.\u201d</p><p>The movements looked casual, as if they were drifting from one position in the room to another without any real reason, but when they stopped, Daemon and Lucivar were flanking the women. Theran had the impression that no matter what they personally thought about what had just happened, they would support and defend their wives\u2014and Cassidy.</p><p>Gray looked anxious and uncertain when he and Saetan rejoined their tense little group, and he stared at Cassidy\u2019s face for so long all three women squirmed.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Saetan said, his voice a velvet-coated whip.</p><p>Theran felt his shoulders tighten in response to that sound. This was a voice that allowed no challenge, no discussion, no defiance.</p><p>\u201cEvery relationship requires compromises,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cSo those compromises are going to be established here and now.\u201d</p><p>A moment of silence, as if the High Lord was giving all of them an opportunity to be dumb enough to argue.</p><p>\u201cSince Lady Cassidy\u2019s freckles are important to Gray, they will not be altered in any way,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . ,\u201d Cassidy began.</p><p>\u201cIn. Any. Way.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy hunched her shoulders. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn return, Gray, you must accept that women like to paint their faces, adding color to eyes, lips, and cheeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do they want to do that?\u201d Gray asked, his eyes still fixed on Cassidy\u2019s face as if something might disappear the moment he looked away.</p><p>\u201cBoyo,\u201d Saetan said, \u201cI\u2019ve been observing females for over fifty thousand years, and I can\u2019t tell you why they do what they do. Don\u2019t expect to understand how they think;just understand that some things are important to them that are incomprehensible to us, and learn to work with their way of thinking when you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike putting color on her face?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Saetan replied. \u201cAlthough . . . a woman using face paints to enhance her beauty can be intriguing.\u201d</p><p>Theran watched Gray\u2019s face change, watched anxiety shift to curiosity.</p><p>\u201cDarkening the lashes, for instance, to draw more attention to her eyes,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>\u201cCassie has pretty eyes,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>\u201cPutting a little gold dust on the cheeks\u2014and other places\u2014so the skin glitters in candlelight,\u201d Daemon purred. \u201cBut that\u2019s usually reserved for romantic dinners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d</p><p>Watching Jaenelle blush gave Theran a good idea of how those romantic dinners ended\u2014and the room suddenly got much too warm.</p><p>\u201cNow, the hair,\u201d Saetan said.</p><p>Gray whimpered.</p><p>\u201cChanging the color would be an insult to every man who admires beauty, so it will not be changed.\u201d</p><p>Now Cassidy whimpered.</p><p>\u201cHowever, you, Gray, have to accept that, like their faces, women like to play with their hair, putting it up in different styles or even cutting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut?\u201d Gray sounded alarmed.</p><p>\u201cCompromise, Prince,\u201d Saetan said in that voice that allowed no challenge.</p><p>After a moment, Gray nodded. \u201cOkay. I won\u2019t get upset if she cuts her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re agreed.\u201d</p><p>Theran hadn\u2019t heard anyone but Gray agree to anything, but judging by the look on everyone\u2019s face, that wasn\u2019t going to be mentioned.</p><p>Daemon looked at Gray. \u201cThere\u2019s still a few minutes before dinner. Why don\u2019t we get some fresh air and discuss that other matter?\u201d And he winked.</p><p>Gray\u2019s eyes widened. He started to move, then stopped and looked at the High Lord. \u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done here, so you two go on.\u201d</p><p>When Daemon and Gray left, Saetan fixed his attention on Cassidy, and Theran felt sorry for her. After all, she\u2019d just wanted to get rid of those awful spots and look a little better. It wasn\u2019t her fault Gray had gotten fixated on the damn things.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know,\u201d Cassidy said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cNow you do,\u201d Saetan said in that implacable voice.</p><p>Cassidy brushed her fingers against one cheek. \u201cMaybe . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitchling, if you really think that boy isn\u2019t going to notice if a single freckle is missing, then you have not been paying attention.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The whiplash without the velvet coating.</p><p>Theran winced.</p><p>Jaenelle squared her shoulders. \u201cIf you gentlemen will excuse us, my Sisters and I need a few minutes to settle before dinner.\u201d</p> <p>Saetan tipped his head in a bow and walked out of the room.</p><p>Lucivar kissed his wife\u2019s head and left the room, giving Theran no choice but to follow him to another sitting room.</p><p>\u201cI need some air,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>Theran shook his head.</p><p>As Lucivar opened a glass door that led to some kind of courtyard, Theran said, \u201cI guess the High Lord wouldn\u2019t have lashed at them like that if Lady Angelline had still been the Queen of Ebon Askavi.\u201d</p> <p>Lucivar gave him an odd look. \u201cThen you would have guessed wrong.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 23</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>No sex tonight, Daemon thought as he took off his robe and slipped into bed. Propped up on one elbow, he studied Jaenelle\u2019s face. She\u2019d been broody and unhappy all the way home, and it didn\u2019t look like her mood had changed.</p><p>\u201cWell, things didn\u2019t go too badly,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jaenelle made a sound that was one part laugh and two parts disbelief. \u201cWhat dinner party were you at tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe point of the evening was to give Gray a foundation for interacting with a Kaeleer Queen, and in that, I think we did quite well.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI created an illusion spell to give Cassie more confidence about her looks and ended up scaring Gray out of half his wits, and also managed to stomp on Papa\u2019s toes hard enough to have him angry with me twice, and you think we did well?\u201d</p><p>Daemon raised a shoulder in a half shrug. \u201cGray got to ask about things that were bothering him, he now has a measuring stick for how to react the next time Cassidy does something that upsets him, and he learned that he doesn\u2019t have to give up the things that are most important to him if he\u2019s willing to yield about other things.\u201d Gauging her mood\u2014unchanged\u2014he added,\u201cAnd I learned that Lucivar\u2019s idea of a romantic kiss is not drooling on the girl or chewing her face.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle popped up so fast she almost clobbered his chin.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re making that up. He is not that . . . that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyrien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Night.\u201d Jaenelle looked a little stunned, but when her sapphire eyes focused on him, he wished he had the width of the bed between them. And he was beginning to think that teasing her about Lucivar\u2019s sexual skills hadn\u2019t been the best idea. Especially since he knew Lucivar had said that for Gray\u2019s benefit.</p><p>\u201cYou have to do something,\u201d Jaenelle said.</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo woman should have to put up with that. And certainly Marian shouldn\u2019t have to put up with that. If that\u2019s Lucivar\u2019s idea of romance, you need to teach him how to kiss properly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a man is doing it right, there\u2019s nothing proper about a romantic kiss,\u201d Daemon murmured.</p><p>\u201cDaemon.\u201d She poked his chest with a finger. \u201cDo something.\u201d</p><p>So he did. He kissed her. And when he was done, one of her hands was fisted in his hair, encouraging him not to go too far away.</p><p>\u201cI gave Gray some tips about romantic kissing,\u201d he said as his lips drifted across her face, leaving a trail of delicate kisses.</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d She sounded breathless, and her scent had shifted toward arousal enough to warm his blood very nicely.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I don\u2019t think he had his mind on much else through the whole of dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains why he was so cheerful,\u201d Jaenelle murmured, tipping her head to one side so that he could nibble on his favorite part of her neck.</p><p>\u201cLucivar is a more difficult challenge.\u201d He slipped one hand under her nightgown and his fingertips whispered up and down the insides of her thighs.</p><p>Nothing in her eyes now but desire. Nothing in her touch but love as she slipped a hand under the covers and stroked him.</p><p>\u201cI should practice my technique,\u201d he said as he licked the valley between her breasts.</p><p>\u201cDaemon,\u201d she gasped when his fingers found other interesting bits of her to play with. \u201cHow much practice do you need?\u201d</p><p>He settled over her, enjoying, for the moment, the thin barrier of fabric between them. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know in the morning,\u201d he purred.</p><p>Her reply was a moan of pleasure.</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Theran walked into the parlor in the family wing and flopped on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWant some brandy?\u201d Talon asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He accepted the glass Talon poured for him, then slugged back half the liquor.</p><p>\u201cHow did it go tonight?\u201d Talon asked, settling into a chair near the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWell enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Gray all right?\u201d</p><p>Theran made a sound that might have been a laugh. \u201cBetter than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. He didn\u2019t want Talon to be alarmed; he just didn\u2019t know if he should repeat what he\u2019d been told. Wasn\u2019t sure he wanted Talon to agree with the High Lord\u2019s assessment.</p><p>\u201cGray is like them,\u201d he said, swirling the brandy so he wouldn\u2019t have to look at Talon. \u201cHe fit in like he was just another piece of an intricate pattern. The way he talked with them, listened to them. If he decides to emigrate to Dharo, they\u2019ll help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he decides what?\u201d</p><p>Theran winced. Of course Talon didn\u2019t know about it. Gray hadn\u2019t mentioned it until this morning.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know him tonight,\u201d Theran said. \u201cHe had one of his . . . scares . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Talon muttered.</p><p>\u201c. . . and they handled it, Sadi and the High Lord. Soothing spells and power. They got him settled in minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think to ask about the spell?\u201d Talon asked. \u201cSounds like a handy thing to know. Hell\u2019s fire, I\u2019ve tried everything I know and couldn\u2019t get him settled when he was having a bad night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe High Lord took me aside after dinner and taught me the soothing spell he\u2019d used. He considered it a basic spell and was surprised that it wasn\u2019t part of our usual training.\u201d</p><p>Talon studied him, then sat back in his chair. \u201cYou\u2019re circling around something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran\u2019s blade,\u201d Theran said quietly. \u201cGray and I used to joke about him being my great protector. But Jewels only measure one kind of power, don\u2019t they? Two men can wear the same Jewel, even have the exact same depth of power, and one might be a dominant male, while the other is better as a follower. If Gray hadn\u2019t been captured twelve years ago, if we\u2019d both grown up as we should have, he would have been my defender. He would have stood in front of me. Overshadowed me. Because he\u2019s a Warlord Prince like they are\u2014like Sadi and Yaslana\u2014or he would have been. I could almost see him changing, hour by hour, as he talked with them. The High Lord said that even with his emotional scars, Gray won\u2019t have any trouble settling in Kaeleer if that\u2019s what he decides to do.\u201d</p><p>Theran drained his glass and poured himself another. \u201cGray remained a child all these years, so I had to become a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have become a man no matter what,\u201d Talon said. He shifted in his chair, a restless movement that wasn\u2019t like him. \u201cSo you don\u2019t fit in with Sadi and Yaslana. There aren\u2019t many who could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to bed,\u201d Talon said. \u201cThings will look different after some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Theran rose and lifted his glass in a salute. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>Talon waited until Theran left the room before he got up to pour and warm a glass of yarbarah.</p><p>. . . Jewels only measure one kind of power. . . . would have stood in front of me . . . Overshadowed me . . . he\u2019s a Warlord Prince like they are....</p><p>Talon raised the glass and studied the blood wine. \u201cTheran, my boy, I\u2019ll never say this to your face, but you\u2019re right about Gray. He would have overshadowed you. Not deliberately. He\u2019d been taught from the cradle on up that he was your sword and your shield. Had been raised to believe it was his duty to protect and defend the Grayhaven line. Men have followed you because of your name, but being a leader is still an ill-fitting coat on you. For Gray, being the dominant Warlord Prince of Dena Nehele would have been as natural as breathing.\u201d</p><p>He took a swallow of yarbarah. \u201cYou might have ended up hating him for being what everyone expected you to be. And as much as my heart aches to say it, and as much as I wish he\u2019d never been harmed, maybe it\u2019s just as well he\u2019s waking up now when you\u2019re old enough to hold your own.\u201d</p><p>Talon drank the rest of the yarbarah and sighed. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just as well.\u201d</p><p>Gray leaned against the outside wall of the stone shed and studied the glow of witchlight coming from his window. Soft light, Daemon had said. Enough so nobody was stumbling around in the dark, but not so much to spotlight desire. It was easier to yield just a little more in the dark.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t that a wonder? he thought as he waited for Cassie. Talking to Daemon was like having an older friend who not only knew things about women but was willing to tell you things.</p><p>Was willing to do more than tell.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on her waist. Like this. She\u2019ll be so concerned with apologizing for that damn illusion spell, she won\u2019t even notice your hands until the warmth seeps through her clothes. That moment when she becomes aware is when the romance needs to begin. She\u2019s feeling vulnerable tonight. She\u2019ll try to shy away. This is the moment when you offer just enough to make her want more. Let her lose a few hours\u2019 sleep because you\u2019ve given her a reason to think about you. To wonder about you. To dream about you.\u201d</p><p>Then Daemon had shown him. . . .</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d Cassie called softly. \u201cGray, are you in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack here,\u201d he called.</p><p>Realizing a tactical error, he shifted so his back was against the shed. That way, once she was standing in front of him, it would be easy to shift so she was in the soft light and he was in the shadows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She came around the corner, hesitated a moment, then hurried to reach him.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d she asked, sounding like she was braced for bad news.</p><p>\u201cWhy would something be wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a soft night in early summer,\u201d he replied, smiling. \u201cThe air is deliciously scented with all the things that are growing.\u201d And I was waiting for you.</p><p>\u201cGray, I\u2019m sorry about the illusion spell. I didn\u2019t know it would upset you. I just wanted to look . . .\u201d She pressed her lips together.</p><p>He shifted away from the wall and put his hands on her waist, holding her lightly. \u201cHow did you want to look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty. Or as pretty as someone like me can look.\u201d</p> <p>He heard pain and bitterness in her voice, and he suspected someone had inflicted a deep wound at some time in her life, but he didn\u2019t understand what that wound had to do with her using that stupid illusion spell. \u201cWhy do you want to be pretty when you\u2019re already beautiful?\u201d</p><p>So vulnerable.</p><p>She didn\u2019t believe him. Couldn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>She drew in a breath, probably to deny what he\u2019d said. Instead, she looked at him, and he saw the moment she realized his hands were on her, realized how close they were standing, realized what the brush of her body was doing to his.</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d Gray whispered.</p><p>He placed the first feather kiss at the corner of her mouth and worked his way along a cheekbone up to her temple. \u201cCassie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand yet how you see her, boyo,\u201d Daemon had said, \u201cso don\u2019t waste your breath on words that will cause her to pay attention to the wrong things.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t waste his breath. He diligently practiced the things he\u2019d been taught that evening and felt her melt against him, caught the intoxicating scent of her arousal, both physical and psychic. When she pressed her lips to his and slipped her tongue in his mouth, he wrapped his arms around her and almost ignored the last instruction.</p><p>His self-preservation kicked in when he remembered who would demand an explanation if he ignored that last instruction.</p><p>He waited until she broke the kiss before he eased back\u2014and added the footnote to the evening.</p><p>\u201cEverything has a price, Lady,\u201d Gray said, smiling. \u201cYou owe me a little something for that illusion spell.\u201d</p><p>A jumble of emotions in her hazel eyes, wariness and arousal being dominant. \u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer to a question.\u201d</p><p>She relaxed a little.</p> <p>\u201cAre the freckles only on your face?\u201d</p><p>Her face colored. She swallowed hard and eventually said, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not just on my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing the rest of them.\u201d He stepped back, not sure if he wanted to snarl or whimper about that particular instruction. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s late. I\u2019ll walk you back to the house.\u201d</p><p>She looked a little dazed during the walk back to the house. She looked more than a little confused as he nudged her inside and closed the door.</p><p>And he thought the light would be burning in her bedroom for a while longer that night.</p><p>Returning to his little room in the shed, he stripped and got into bed. He wanted to write the letter to Lord Burle and ask about the plants, but he didn\u2019t feel quite ballsy enough to write a polite letter to Burle when he was having these kinds of feelings about the man\u2019s daughter\u2014and wanting to do things with that daughter that were less than polite.</p><p>So he turned off the lamp and lay in the dark, thinking about the evening. He\u2019d made friends tonight. He was damaged, and they didn\u2019t dismiss that, but even though nothing had been said, the High Lord, Lucivar, and Daemon had made it plain that they expected him to live up to his potential. And if he asked, they would show him how.</p><p>\u201cDaemon? Have you kissed men before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d Sadi\u2019s mouth curved in a predatory smile. \u201cSome even survived the experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you taught other boys to kiss the way you just taught me?\u201d</p><p>The smile softened, and there was an odd expression in Daemon\u2019s gold eyes. \u201cI taught Jared. And Blaed.\u201d</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>Saetan swirled the brandy in the snifter.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known about this bitch, she wouldn\u2019t still be among the living.\u201d</p><p>He should have known about her. Daemon had said the witch wasn\u2019t a girl, and it was hard to believe this incident was the first time she\u2019d flirted that way with a married man\u2014especially because the detail of taking a shirt as a trophy kept tugging at him, making him think the scenario he\u2019d told Jaenelle wasn\u2019t just a scenario. It was also hard to believe she waited decades between her victims, which meant she\u2019d been playing this game while he\u2019d actively ruled Dhemlan.</p><p>And no one had told him. Even if the Queens, for some inexplicable reason, had chosen to remain ignorant of the bitch\u2019s activities, at least one Warlord Prince should have had balls enough to come to the Hall and inform him.</p><p>His conclusion? Some of her prey had helped cover her tracks and hide her games.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t interested in the men. Not yet, anyway. But the witch who had dared try to tangle up his son in her petty little game . . .</p><p>A flicker of memory, there and gone. A man\u2019s anguish. A child\u2019s face.</p><p>Or what was left of the child\u2019s face.</p><p>There and gone.</p><p>Taking the brandy with him, he went out to one of the courtyards.</p><p>\u201cWhen I stepped away from the living Realms, and Dhemlan,\u201d he told the night sky,\u201cI thought I\u2019d given Daemon a healthy Territory and a clean slate to begin his rule. But it looks like I have some unfinished business after all.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 24</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Several days after the dinner party at the Keep,Theran walked into Powell\u2019s office so soon after breakfast, the Steward wasn\u2019t settled behind his desk yet.</p><p>\u201cDid the letter arrive?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe messenger just returned from the Keep with the sack,\u201d Powell replied. \u201cI haven\u2019t even opened it yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, get on with it.\u201d</p><p>Before Powell could say what he looked like he wanted to say, Ranon and Shira walked into the office, with Archerr following right behind them.</p><p>\u201cDid the letter arrive?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Powell muttered. \u201cThe last time this many men were interested in a single letter, it was because all the young men in my village were waiting to see who the prettiest girl had asked to be her escort to the harvest dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been enough time,\u201d Theran muttered. \u201cHow long can it take to write down the names of a few plants?\u201d</p><p>Shira rolled her eyes. \u201cMen are so dim about some things. The more it matters, the more time it takes.\u201d</p><p>Theran gave Ranon a sharp smile. \u201cSo what\u2019s Ranon hurrying that he shouldn\u2019t be?\u201d</p><p>Ranon snarled at Theran.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about him,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>\u201cIf anyone is interested,\u201d Powell said, \u201cLady Cassidy has two letters here\u2014no, three. And there\u2019s a box for Gray. Looks like Prince Sadi\u2019s writing on the label, and that\u2019s definitely the SaDiablo seal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Theran and Ranon said.</p><p>Theran sighed, then raked his fingers through his dark hair. \u201cGive it to me. I\u2019ll take it out to Gray.\u201d And try to figure out what to say today when that look of disappointment fills his eyes.</p><p>Powell handed over the box.</p><p>Breakfast felt like a cold, heavy lump in Theran\u2019s stomach, and it got heavier and colder with every step he took toward the ground Gray was breaking for this new planting.</p><p>He\u2019s working too hard, hoping for too much, Theran thought. These past few days, he had the feeling that Gray had made a blind leap and had broken the life he\u2019d cobbled together, but wasn\u2019t sure of what kind of life he would have in its place. What kind of life he could build.</p><p>If he could build anything at all.</p><p>\u201cGray?\u201d</p><p>Gray set aside the spade and reached for the water jug. He glanced at the box Theran carried, but he didn\u2019t ask about it. He drank, then pulled a scrap of towel out of the waistband of his trousers and wiped his face.</p><p>\u201cNo letter,\u201d he said.</p><p>There was a flatness in Gray\u2019s voice, a lack of light in his eyes, that worried Theran.</p><p>\u201cNo letter,\u201d Theran said. \u201cBut this box came from Prince Sadi. Gray, it hasn\u2019t been that long since you sent the letter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong enough for a mother to decide that she doesn\u2019t want a particular man showing interest in her daughter.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night, Gray, what are you thinking?</p><p>The hurt in Gray\u2019s voice made it clear exactly what his cousin was thinking: he wasn\u2019t good enough to be more than a friend.</p><p>\u201cOpen the box,\u201d Theran said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s an explanation.\u201d</p><p>Gray wiped his hands on his trousers to clean off some of the dirt. Then he took the box and set it on the freshly turned earth, which made Theran wonder why he\u2019d bothered to wipe off his hands.</p><p>The box had a simple hook closure, so whatever was inside couldn\u2019t be valuable. Or it meant that no one would be foolish enough to take anything from a box that had the SaDiablo seal.</p><p>Gray opened the box. He sat back on his heels. He lifted one Craft-preserved flower out of the box. Then another\u2014and another until he was holding a bouquet.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a note and a book in there,\u201d Theran said, looking into the box. \u201cAnd something else.\u201d</p><p>Handing the bouquet to Theran, Gray opened the note.</p><p>\u201c \u2018Prince Gray,\u2019 \u201d Gray read.</p><p>\u201cA common-ground planting is a wonderful idea. The seeds I gave Cassie were meant to span the seasons, so there aren\u2019t many yet that I can show you. I\u2019ve sent flowers from the late-spring and early-summer plants, but hopefully you\u2019ll be able to match the others from the sketches in the book. The bulbs can go in pots. Those, too, span the seasons\u2014a reminder of family as she makes a new home. Burle spoke highly of you. I\u2019m beginning to see why. I hope we can meet one day.

There are drawings and information about planting, and . . .\u201d He closed the book and studied the cover. \u201cCassie\u2019s mother wrote this book. Cassie said her mother knew a lot about gardening, but I didn\u2019t realize. . . . No wonder she understands the land so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than good. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d Gray\u2019s eyes widened and his face paled. He grabbed the bouquet from Theran and shoved it in the box. \u201cCassie\u2019s coming. You have to distract her. She\u2019ll notice I\u2019m breaking new ground, and she\u2019ll ask about it, and I can\u2019t lie to her. I can\u2019t. And she can\u2019t see what her mother sent. She\u2019ll know then, and it will spoil the surprise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheran.\u201d</p><p>Step up to the line, Grayhaven, and be his shield. What he feels for Cassidy is something you\u2019ve never felt for anyone. Not even in passing.</p><p>\u201cGet that stuff tucked away,\u201d Theran said as he rose and turned toward the house.</p><p>\u201cThanks,Theran.\u201d</p> <p>He watched Gray bolt for the stone shed, then hurried to intercept Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong with Gray?\u201d Cassidy asked as soon as he got close enough to hear her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Theran replied, taking her arm and turning her back toward the house. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bundle of work he wants to get done today.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t dressed for spending time in the garden this morning. Was that good or bad, since she always spent time in the garden after breakfast?</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should give him a hand?\u201d</p><p>Cassidy sounded doubtful. Was she trying to back away from Gray? She had been acting a bit skittish about being around him. At first Gray had been pleased about that, but that had changed more and more as the hoped-for letter didn\u2019t arrive.</p> <p>\u201cI was going to come out and work in the garden, but Ranon is going back to his home village for a couple of days, and he and Powell said there was something urgent I needed to do before Ranon left, but they weren\u2019t clear about what that was, and said I should talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Theran tossed a psychic thread toward Ranon. *Next time you decide to be helpful, give me some warning.*</p><p>*We gave her a reason to come looking for you instead of Gray, so figure out why she\u2019s supposed to be stuck at a desk for the next few hours.*</p><p>Go piss yourself. He didn\u2019t say it, but the feeling traveled through the link between them\u2014and the feeling was quite mutual.</p><p>What could he ask her to do that had to be done before Ranon left?</p><p>They were on the terrace and almost to the door before he had an answer.</p><p>\u201cThe Shalador Queens,\u201d Theran said. \u201cYou need to write a letter inviting the Queens on the Shalador reserves to meet you. Ranon will take the letter when he goes back to his village. That\u2019s why it\u2019s urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me to contact the Queens in Dena Nehele,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve opposed that suggestion every time I\u2019ve made it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeemed more important for the court to adjust to working with each other. Now . . .\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou really want me to contact the Queens on the reserves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Besides, he added silently, it\u2019s not likely any of them will come.</p><p>He opened the door for her. \u201cCome on. Once you wade through the paperwork Powell seems to create overnight, you\u2019ll be free the rest of the day to save the posies from the nasty weeds.\u201d</p><p>She stopped in the doorway and looked at him as if she suddenly saw a different man.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a feel for the land, do you?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s just dirt and boundaries to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuss over it like you and Gray seem to,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s the people that matter. It\u2019s the people that need tending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you take care of one without taking care of the other?\u201d</p><p>Since she didn\u2019t wait for him to answer, he guessed she didn\u2019t expect one.</p><p>Gray set the items in the box on the potting bench, one by one, and marveled at this gift.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s mother had written this book. Cassie\u2019s mother had sent this box. No hasty reply to his letter, but a bundle of information from a woman who seemed to understand that he was hoping to put down roots in her daughter\u2019s heart.</p><p>And the flowers, preserved in shields so he could study them at his leisure.</p><p>His own mother had given him a fierce kind of love. He didn\u2019t know if it was because she was unable to be soft, or if because he\u2019d been destined for the killing fields, she hadn\u2019t wanted to give him anything a warrior wouldn\u2019t need.</p><p>He could still see her face, filled with hard pride, on the evening when Talon came to take him to the mountain camps. He\u2019d been seven years old, but there had been no tears, no hugs. To her, he was already a warrior. To her, he always had been.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think Cassie\u2019s mother was a fierce woman. Didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t be dangerous if there was need, but he thought, maybe, she\u2019d be the kind of woman who wouldn\u2019t be afraid to hug a boy.</p><p>Was his mother still alive? Did she know how to find him\u2014if she wanted to find him?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t wondered until now. Maybe Powell, being the Steward of the court, would know how to find out.</p><p>A knock on the shed\u2019s door. He used Craft to vanish the box before the door opened and Ranon walked in.</p><p>The Shalador Warlord Prince glanced at the empty potting bench.</p><p>\u201cNone of my business,\u201d Ranon said, \u201cbut I saw the box this morning. Well, a few of us did, and we wondered. . . .\u201d</p><p>Gray called in the box and showed Ranon what Devra had sent to him.</p><p>\u201cLook at this one,\u201d Ranon said, picking up one of the cuttings. \u201cIt\u2019s got one flower open and one still in the bud. Maybe that\u2019s why it took her a few days to send a reply. She must have waited for some of these flowers to bloom so she could send them to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d</p><p>Ranon set the cutting down. \u201cLook, Gray, planting this bed is going to be a lot of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you planning to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need a few days to study the book and select the plants that will work best in the place I\u2019ve cleared. Then I\u2019ll need to see what I can find.\u201d</p><p>Ranon nodded. \u201cI\u2019m heading to my village, but I\u2019ll be back in a couple of days. Three at the most. When you\u2019re ready to plant, I\u2019d like to help. Shira said she\u2019d help too. And I think there are a couple of other men in the First Circle who would be willing to help.\u201d</p><p>Gray studied Ranon, seeing more than a Warlord Prince who seemed to rub against Theran the wrong way.</p><p>\u201cYou liked Yaslana, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Ranon gave him a considering look. \u201cThat one scares the shit out of me, but I\u2019d follow him into battle without a doubt or second thought.\u201d</p><p>And you\u2019d have both if it was Theran who was leading.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the offer,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI\u2019ll figure out the planting day and let you know.\u201d</p><p>Ranon smiled and walked to the shed door. Then he paused. \u201cShira wanted me to ask. Are you the reason Cassidy isn\u2019t sleeping well?\u201d</p><p>Gray grinned.</p><p>After a moment Ranon laughed. \u201cGood for you, Gray. Good for you.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy sat on the edge of her bed, fingering the key she\u2019d found in the old wish pot\u2014something she\u2019d done every day, hoping the key would provide some clue to the treasure that was supposed to exist on the estate. Of course, her mind wasn\u2019t on treasure. Not tonight. Her mind was on . . .</p><p>\u201cLia and Thera, your male descendants are a pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>At least Theran and Gray could share the blame for her being unable to sleep tonight. Theran had run hot and cold all morning\u2014wanting her to write to the Shalador Queens and then being opposed to her writing to any of the other Queens who must have heard by now that there was a Territory Queen to whom they owed allegiance. Then this evening, Gray had just run . . . hot. But not hot enough to do more than kissing and petting. Not hot enough to go to his room and make use of his bed.</p><p>But that could be Lucivar\u2019s fault because at one point this evening, when Gray pulled away because what he really needed was more, he had snarled something about writing to Daemon to find out if he really had to follow that stupid schedule.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t met Daemon before the dinner party, but she\u2019d spent enough time around Lucivar to know the Eyrien wouldn\u2019t hesitate to give Gray a few bruises if Gray didn\u2019t stay within the boundaries Lucivar had set. So until Daemon convinced Lucivar to alter the rules, she wasn\u2019t going to ask Gray for more.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d have the courage to ask for more anyway.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter who decided what, she thought sourly as she turned the key over and over. It still means another sleepless night.</p><p>A scratching on her suite\u2019s door. She got up to let Vae in, mostly because the sofa in her sitting room was a comfortable place to brood.</p><p>*Cassie? Cassie! You are not sleeping. Why aren\u2019t you sleeping? It is sleep time. Everyone is sleeping. Except Talon. But it is not his sleep time.*</p><p>Cassidy barely had time to settle into a corner of the sofa before Vae was beside her, pressing close.</p><p>\u201cYou need to be brushed,\u201d Cassidy said, noticing how much loose fur was now coating her trousers.</p><p>*I will nip Theran tomorrow,* Vae said. *Then he will brush me.*</p><p>Oh, good. Serves you right, Grayhaven, for being a brainless ass.</p><p>*You have smells,* Vae said happily.</p><p>Cassidy was about to remind Vae that it wasn\u2019t polite to talk about human smells\u2014especially the female kind. Then she realized the Sceltie was focused on the key in her hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a key,Vae. It\u2019s made of metal. It doesn\u2019t have smells.\u201d</p><p>Vae sniffed the key again, jumped off the sofa, and trotted into the bedroom. *I will find the smells.* </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d If the dog was hunting for nonexistent smells, at least she\u2019d stay out of trouble. Maybe.</p><p>Keeping one ear cocked toward the bedroom in case Vae began rummaging where she shouldn\u2019t, Cassidy slumped in the corner of the sofa, feeling frustrated and wrung out.</p><p>Sometimes when Gray kissed her, she knew she was being kissed\u2014and held\u2014by a grown man. But other times, she felt like she was kissing a fifteen-year-old boy who was fumbling through his first exploration of a female body. And in some ways she was. But she wasn\u2019t fifteen anymore, and those times when he seemed more boy than man made her uncomfortable.</p> <p>And yet she couldn\u2019t back away from the intimacy or end the relationship altogether, because her heart recognized something in Gray that she had never felt with or for any other man.</p><p>*Cassie?*</p><p>Maybe it was for the best that Lucivar had set such firm boundaries around what Gray could\u2014and couldn\u2019t\u2014do in terms of sex. Physically she was ready\u2014more than ready\u2014for more. Emotionally . . .</p><p>*Cassie!*</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She felt frustrated and snappish, and her voice proclaimed her mood.</p> <p>*I found the smells.*</p><p>\u201cWhat smells?\u201d</p><p>*The smells that match the key.*</p><p>Cassidy tangled her legs and almost fell off the sofa in her haste to get to the bedroom.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see anything messed up or displaced. She also didn\u2019t see a Sceltie.</p><p>\u201cVae?\u201d</p> <p>*Here! The smells are here!*</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>The tip of Vae\u2019s tail suddenly stuck out from under her bed, wagged at her, then disappeared again.</p><p>Cassidy hurried to the bed, dropped to the floor, and lifted the bedcovers. \u201cGet out of there before you get stuck.\u201d</p><p>*Won\u2019t get stuck,* Vae said. *Smells are here.*</p><p>Under the bed. The treasure had been hidden for centuries. Wouldn\u2019t someone have looked under the bed?</p><p>That wish pot had been in the shed for centuries too and hadn\u2019t been found.</p><p>\u201cGet out of there,Vae,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cI have to move the bed, and I can\u2019t do that while you\u2019re under it.\u201d</p> <p>She waited impatiently while Vae wiggled out from under the bed. Then she used Craft to lift and shift the bed as far as she could.</p><p>Vae went back to sniffing the carpet, then began scratching.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Cassidy said firmly. She moved the night tables and rolled up the carpet.</p><p>No trapdoor. No visible sign that there was anything different about that part of the floor. No lock embedded in the wood.</p><p>*Here,*Vae said, placing a small white paw near the spot that held the smells.</p><p>Cassidy ran her fingers over and over that spot. And found nothing until she held the key over that part of the floor.</p><p>A shadow so subtle she wasn\u2019t sure she was seeing anything. But the key slipped into that shadow like a well-oiled lock, and when she turned it, a rectangle of floor as long as her arm popped up. When she moved it aside . . .</p><p>Vae sniffed. Sneezed.</p><p>Ignoring the box in the secret compartment, Cassidy took out one of the books and opened it to a random page.</p><p>Like the letter in the wish pot, the ink had faded, although not as badly.</p><p>\u201cA journal,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Paper?Vae asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p>\u201cYes, paper. But valuable.\u201d It didn\u2019t take more than reading a few lines to realize this was Lia\u2019s journal\u2014and a few lines more to realize the entries were made near the end of her life.</p><p>Cassidy riffled the pages until she found the last entry. Which was written by a different hand.</p><p>Lia is dead. And Dena Nehele grieves.</p><p>Without the Gray Lady, Dena Nehele will fall to the twisted ideas Dorothea SaDiablo spews. It won\u2019t happen next year, or the year after that. The dreams and visions I see in my tangled webs all show me the same thing\u2014Lia\u2019s granddaughter will hold the land for a while. Long enough to keep the bloodline from dying out with so much else that will die in the years ahead. And Jared and his grandsons will continue fighting to keep the shadows at bay.</p><p>I will die before the seasons change, slaughtered here at Grayhaven, which should have been the safest place, while Jared, Blaed, and Talon are fighting elsewhere. I will not tell them because if they are here, they will not survive\u2014and they must survive a few years longer. They must.</p><p>Lia is dead. Tomorrow I will grieve. Tonight I will set in motion all the spells we created to keep the treasure safe\u2014and the hope that is hidden with it.</p><p>Thera</p><p>Cassidy closed the journal and started to put it back. Then she hesitated. If she left it all where it had been safely hidden for so long, would the key work a second time? Or was this part of the spell done, and this was the only opportunity to retrieve these items?</p><p>Not willing to take that chance, she pulled all the journals out of the compartment and set them aside before she removed the last item\u2014the trinket box.</p><p>During all this, Vae stayed with her, not really interested or curious, but still watchful.</p><p>Cassidy opened the trinket box and smiled as she lifted a few pieces from the jumble of jewelry.</p><p>No expensive pieces here, no precious stones. She imagined that, during Lia\u2019s lifetime, the pieces weren\u2019t jumbled to deceive someone into thinking they weren\u2019t important. Because these trinkets were important. When she went through the journals, she\u2019d find each piece recorded. Gifts from Lia\u2019s children. Sentimental presents from her husband. Not expensive, but priceless nonetheless.</p><p>She spent an hour wiping the journals and trinket box clean of dust before hiding them in the bottom of a trunk of her own belongings.</p><p>Then she put the piece of floor back in place.</p><p>*The smells are gone,* Vae said.</p><p>The key was embedded in the wood, and when she tried to remove it, it broke cleanly, becoming nothing more than an odd gold glint in the wood.</p><p>She put the rest of the key in her own trinket box, then finished putting the room in order.</p><p>Time had made its shift from late night to early morning before she finally climbed into bed withVae stretched out beside her.</p><p>Just before she fell asleep, she realized why the servants had acted so oddly when she\u2019d chosen these rooms over the fancy Queen\u2019s suite.</p><p>This must have been the suite that had belonged to Lia.</p><p>CHAPTER 25</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Vulchera slipped into the bedroom and looked around. The maid had turned down the bedcovers and plumped the pillows. Everything was ready for the Warlord when he bade the other guests good night and came up here to his chaste bed.</p><p>Damn Sadi for his lack of discretion. Why in the name of Hell did he have to explode like that? She hadn\u2019t been aiming for him at that house party. Not initially. But when he wouldn\u2019t even flirt with her, when he looked at her with those cold yellow eyes like she was some kind of scabby street whore, when every remark he did make to her had been blandly worded but so heavily laced with contempt everyone knew he wouldn\u2019t consider soiling himself by being with her . . .</p><p>Well, she had her pride, didn\u2019t she? She\u2019d wanted only to give him a twinge of discomfort, a little payback because the other men who had been present at Rhea\u2019s country house had taken a good measure of Sadi\u2019s feelings and avoided her.</p><p>She\u2019d wanted only to make him uneasy. She certainly hadn\u2019t intended to do anything that would upset Jaenelle Angelline. Anyone who had heard about what Sadi had done to Lady Lektra last spring knew better than to aim anything, even a barbed comment, at Sadi\u2019s wife.</p><p>But he had exploded when he found her in his room, had heaped his rage on Rhea\u2019s head to the point where the Province Queen had \u201csuggested\u201d she leave their little house party\u2014and had made it clear there would never be another invitation.</p><p>They had been friends, and she\u2019d truly liked Rhea. Besides, having a Province Queen as a friend had put her in contact with the kind of men who could be most useful, and it had provided her with some clout she wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise when she\u2019d asked for favors from those men, even if Rhea hadn\u2019t been aware of providing that clout. Now it was all spoiled because she had miscalculated the depth of Sadi\u2019s rage.</p><p>None of that mattered now. Rhea still wanted to believe that she had intended to meet a lover who was an available male and had gotten the rooms mixed up. But they both knew Rhea\u2019s court was going to break under the weight of Sadi\u2019s temper, and that the friendship was just the first thing to break because of her mistake.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t prudent to play this game again so soon, especially at this particular friend\u2019s house. His wife didn\u2019t like her. He didn\u2019t like her, but he was an aristo Warlord who had wanted a bit of spice instead of what he usually found in his marriage bed. The shirt she\u2019d kept as a memento of that evening gave her a standing invitation to his house\u2014at least until his youngest son went through the Birthright Ceremony and he was granted paternity.</p><p>But she had to know\u2014had to\u2014if Sadi\u2019s threat had been an empty one. She\u2019d gone to her Healer and was assured there was nothing wrong. She\u2019d gone to a Black Widow, who assured her there was no sign of any kind of spell around her.</p><p>Assurances. But not enough assurance, not when the person aiming a spell at her was a Black-Jeweled Warlord Prince. She had to know if Sadi really could strip her of the ability to get any pleasure out of sex.</p><p>She\u2019d picked the Warlord at this house party because he was married and he\u2019d made it clear he wanted to romp. At any other time, she wouldn\u2019t have done more than flirt with him, because he wasn\u2019t wealthy enough or influential enough to do her favors. But he would help her prove that nothing would happen to her\u2014as long as she avoided crossing paths with Sadi.</p><p>The candle-light in the lamp on the table beside the bed was on a low setting and, oddly, lit only one side of the room, leaving the other side midnight dark. She shrugged off that detail even quicker than she stripped off her clothes until she was down to high-heeled shoes and sheer panties.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t that considerate of him? she thought when she noticed the shirt draped over a chair.</p><p>Heavy silk, lovely to touch. She hadn\u2019t seen him wear anything like this, wouldn\u2019t have guessed he could afford a shirt like this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unless this was the shirt he offered women for a romp.</p><p>The thought wasn\u2019t appealing, and even less appealing was the possibility that he might not think her being here was anything special.</p><p>But there was a hint of spice rising up from the shirt where her hands had warmed the silk. Not cologne, just a spicy male scent that made her feel fluid and female.</p> <p>She slipped on the shirt, loving the way it settled over her skin. She buttoned the cuffs, then buttoned half the buttons down the front.</p><p>She twirled once, twice. The shirt caressed her skin as it settled around her.</p><p>A bead of sweat tickled her as it followed the channel of her spine.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn. She didn\u2019t want to sweat. At least, not before she and the Warlord were heavily into the romp part of the evening.</p><p>Then she caught sight of herself in the mirror over the dressing table.</p> <p>Dark specks on the shirt, growing bigger by the moment.</p><p>More sweat trickling down her spine.</p><p>What in the name of Hell was going on?</p><p>She walked over to the mirror to get a better look. The shirt was clinging to her shoulders. As she reached the mirror, she pressed her fingers on a patch of now-dark silk.</p><p>When she raised her fingers, they were wet\u2014and red.</p><p>She was sweating blood. How could she be sweating blood?</p> <p>The shirt. Had to be something in the shirt.</p><p>She grabbed the fabric with both hands, intending to tear the shirt off.</p><p>Blood gushed from her hands.</p><p>She released the fabric and stumbled toward the door.</p><p>Help. She needed help.</p><p>The door wouldn\u2019t open.</p><p>She pounded on the door, leaving bloody handprints.</p><p>\u201cHelp me! Somebody, help me!\u201d</p> <p>No response from the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t hear you,\u201d a deep voice said in a singsong croon. \u201cThey won\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>She turned toward the voice coming from the dark side of the room. \u201cMy lover will be coming up to bed at any moment.\u201d</p><p>Movement. Then a man appeared on the edge of the dark side of the room. Most of his face was still in shadow, but his smile was viciously gentle. \u201cThe Warlord? No, my dear, he won\u2019t be coming up here. He was encouraged to leave and is, by now, on his way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she cried.</p><p>The shirt got wetter and heavier, clinging to her skin. Her legs trembled with the effort to remain standing.</p><p>\u201cOdd how much terror can be produced by a piece of cloth,\u201d he said in that singsong croon. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s odd? A simple shirt can destroy a person\u2019s life. How does it feel to be on the receiving end of that fear?\u201d</p><p>She heard the splat of blood dripping off the shirt and hitting the carpet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned my lesson. Do you hear me? I won\u2019t play with married men ever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you won\u2019t.\u201d There was nothing gentle about the gentleness in that deep voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she screamed. \u201cI never played with you!\u201d</p><p>He took a step closer. Got a good look at her face.</p><p>And felt something inside him snap.</p><p>A man\u2019s anguish. What was left of a child\u2019s face. A ceremony. A betrayal. Rage.</p><p>Memories collided, spun, became a twisting storm that hurled him over the border and into the Twisted Kingdom\u2014where a terrible, and familiar, clarity waited for him.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>She knew. How could she not know? But he would play her game a little longer, since it would be the last time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Prince of the Darkness, the High Lord of Hell. And Daemon Sadi\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>The storm inside him gathered speed, gathered power, gathered the cold, deadly rage. The sweet, cleansing rage.</p><p>\u201cYou took my boy.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Lying bitch.</p><p>\u201cYou tried to hurt my son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done anything,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt was just a game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always just a game, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said too softly. \u201cYou like playing games, shattering lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She sank to the floor, too weak to stand.</p><p>He breathed in the exciting scent of blood but had no desire to taste it. Not hers. Not that disgusting, foul brew that flowed in her veins.</p><p>But after this first payment was made . . .</p><p>She was . . . but she wasn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t matter. She and the other were enough alike.</p><p>She tried to hurt his son\u2014and everything has a price.</p><p>He smiled a cold, vicious smile. \u201cDorothea, my darling, it\u2019s finally time to pay the debt.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 26</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Someone tapped lightly on the first of Daemon\u2019s inner barriers, waking him from a sound sleep.</p><p>*Prince Sadi?*</p><p>*Beale?* The butler wasn\u2019t in the bedroom, but Daemon still pulled the covers up around Jaenelle\u2019s delightfully naked body before he shifted far enough to turn over without disturbing her. *Beale?*</p><p>*You\u2019re needed downstairs, Prince,* Beale said.</p><p>He took a moment to sift through the messages coming from the controlled tone of Beale\u2019s voice on the psychic thread as well as the butler\u2019s psychic scent. Whatever brought Beale up here to wake him required his immediate attention but didn\u2019t require a Warlord Prince rising from sleep primed to fight.</p><p>Understanding the careful line the man needed to walk in order to get the desired response rather than the instinctive one, Daemon realized just how skilled Beale was at his job. *What time is it?*</p><p>*A little after three in the morning.*</p><p>Daemon slipped out of bed, pulled on his robe, and went into the Consort\u2019s bedroom, where Beale waited. After putting an aural shield around the room so Jaenelle wouldn\u2019t be disturbed, he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Warlord arrived a few minutes ago,\u201d Beale said, keeping his voice quiet despite the shield. \u201cFrom the Province Queen\u2019s court.\u201d</p><p>Dhemlan had several Provinces, each ruled by a Queen. But there was an edge in Beale\u2019s voice that told Daemon exactly which Province Queen was asking for help.</p><p>Something must have happened to make Rhea desperate enough to ask for his help.</p><p>\u201cApparently there has been some trouble,\u201d Beale said. \u201cUnder other circumstances, I would have assigned the Warlord to a guest room and had him wait to speak with you at a more convenient hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very frightened, Prince. Whatever he heard, whatever he saw . . . He\u2019s very frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Beale is making coffee and will have a plate ready for you. Just a little something until she can make you a proper breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019ll be down in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Beale hesitated, and Daemon noticed a curious kind of tension in the other man.</p><p>\u201cSomething else?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be going to that Province to talk to the Queen?\u201d</p><p>The thought of going back to that damn Province and being a guest of Rhea\u2019s again made his chest muscles tighten so much it was hard to breathe. \u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the SaDiablo estates is in the neighboring Province, almost at the border of the two,\u201d Beale said, sounding as if he was feeling his way over very shaky ground. \u201cIt\u2019s a short distance to travel when a person is riding one of the darker Winds. I could send a messenger and let the staff there know you\u2019ll be staying for a day or two.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead, but now that Beale mentioned the ease of staying somewhere else, he realized it would be some time before he viewed any Queen\u2019s residence as anything but a potential battleground.</p><p>Which was exactly how he had viewed the Queens\u2019 courts when he was a pleasure slave in Terreille.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Beale.\u201d</p><p>Why had Beale mentioned it?</p><p>Look at his eyes, old son. When he did, Daemon felt the ground shift under him just a little.</p><p>\u201cIt is not always a pleasure to work in an aristo house,\u201d Beale said. \u201cEven among the Blood, sometimes the employer forgets that the servant is also a person.\u201d</p><p>What are you driving at, Beale?</p><p>\u201cThe High Lord was an excellent employer. No man who worked on any of his estates or in any of his houses needed to fear that he would be cornered into doing something that would smear his reputation, perhaps irreparably. No woman needed to fear the males around her during the days when she was vulnerable. The High Lord took care of his own. Always.\u201d Beale paused. \u201cAnd so do you. The small courtesies have not gone unnoticed by those who work for you, and the feeling of safety is still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate you telling me.\u201d But they hadn\u2019t gotten to the point of this conversation.</p><p>\u201cYou take care of your own, Prince.\u201d Beale tapped a finger against his own chest. \u201cSo do we. Which is why, when you need to visit the Provinces from now on, the nearest residence that belongs to the SaDiablo family will be ready to accommodate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe residences are always ready. . . .\u201d No, Daemon realized. It wasn\u2019t about the houses. It was about him. It was about staying in a place where he wouldn\u2019t have to be on guard all the time. It was about having servants around him that he could trust.</p><p>It was about other people\u2014one Lady in particular\u2014being safe around him because he felt safe.</p><p>\u201cI should give you a raise,\u201d Daemon said, not sure if he felt grateful or embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cYou already pay me quite well,\u201d Beale said with a little smile as he left the room.</p><p>A few minutes later, dressed in trousers and a dressing gown, Daemon was down in his study listening to the barely coherent report of a murder. When he left the study, he found Jaenelle waiting for him in the great hall, with Beale and the footman Holt in watchful attendance.</p><p>\u201cHave one of the Coaches brought round to the landing web,\u201d Daemon told Beale.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Holt said, looking at Beale.</p><p>Beale nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Mrs. Beale to prepare something you can eat on the way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the two men headed for their assigned tasks, Daemon led Jaenelle into the informal receiving room.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cThe bitch who tried to play with me has been murdered,\u201d Daemon replied.</p> <p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t take long,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cApparently it\u2019s how she died that\u2019s causing alarm. The host\u2019s wife has also been injured, but I don\u2019t have a clear idea of how or how badly. I have to go there.\u201d He could keep his pride or he could ask for what he needed. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was gentle and teasing. \u201cYou want me to come as your escort and protect you from all the nasty witchlings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded.</p> <p>Did she understand what it cost him to ask?</p><p>Of course she did. She was Witch. In some ways, she knew him better than he knew himself.</p><p>She placed a hand against his cheek, a touch full of comfort. \u201cI\u2019ll make a bargain with you, Prince. I\u2019ll stand as your sword and shield when you need it if you\u2019ll do the same for me.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss into her palm. \u201cI\u2019ll take that bargain. Gladly.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cFind out as much as you can, then ask Beale to slip that Warlord the sedative I prepared. I don\u2019t think either of us wants to ride in a Coach with a hysterical man, and I could feel him losing control even before I came downstairs. I\u2019ll pack some clothes and ask Jazen to pack a bag for you.\u201d</p><p>She was about to open the door when Daemon said, \u201cJaenelle, they think it was me.\u201d She didn\u2019t turn to look at him. She froze in place, listening. \u201cRhea sent her man here to ask for help because everyone in that aristo Warlord\u2019s house is more than scared. The Warlord who brought the message is afraid to say as much as he knows, but I got the impression that there\u2019s something about the way Vulchera died that . . . They think they\u2019re asking for help from the same man who killed her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t you,\u201d Jaenelle said, finally turning to look at him. \u201cMay the Darkness have mercy on her, because it wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>She looked pale, and that confirmed his own suspicion. And the worry that went hand in hand with that suspicion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get packed,\u201d she said.</p><p>He went back to his study and reviewed the information with the Warlord again but didn\u2019t learn more than he had gleaned the first time. Leaving the man in Beale\u2019s care, he returned to his suite and took a quick shower before getting dressed.</p><p>The sun\u2014that lazy bastard\u2014was just beginning to think about dawdling its way to the eastern horizon when he tucked the lightly sedated Warlord into the back of the Coach with Holt and took a seat in the driver\u2019s compartment.</p><p>Jaenelle hovered in the doorway between the two compartments, frowning at the large urn of coffee Beale had put in the Coach, along with a variety of foods to provide them with a cold but substantial breakfast.</p><p>Daemon lifted the Coach off the landing web, then caught the Black Wind and headed for the house of the aristo Warlord and his wife.</p><p>\u201cAn urn of coffee?\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cRiding on the Black, it won\u2019t take that long to reach Rhea\u2019s Province and that Warlord\u2019s house. Why would Beale give us that much coffee?\u201d</p> <p>He knew better. He really did. But he tucked his tongue firmly in one cheek and said as casually as possible, \u201cI guess he wanted to make sure I would get a cup with my breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He felt her sapphire eyes fix on a spot between his shoulder blades, and he really wanted to twitch.</p><p>Finally she growled, \u201cDrive the damn Coach.\u201d</p><p>He waited until he was sure she was occupied with fixing a plate of food before he allowed himself to grin.</p><p>And he did, eventually, get a cup of coffee with his breakfast.</p><p>Standing in the hallway beside Jaenelle, Daemon looked at the bedroom and the body\u2014and swallowed hard.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the blood. There had been times when he had drowned rooms in blood, so the sight of a sodden carpet and smears on the walls and furniture didn\u2019t bother him.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t the body, which, from the shoulders down, looked relaxed, as if she\u2019d fallen asleep on the floor.</p><p>It was the rage\u2014the cold, dark, glittering rage\u2014that made him shiver. It filled the room and yet felt elusive, wispy. As if it could be brushed aside. And there was something more in that rage, some quality to it that he knew he should recognize.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Jaenelle said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd may the Darkness be merciful,\u201d Daemon added.</p><p>\u201cShe came upstairs early, said she was tired,\u201d Lord Collyn, the aristo who owned the house, said. There was a bitterness in his voice, in his eyes. \u201cShe often got tired at house parties and went to bed earlier than the other guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t her room?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Collyn replied. \u201cMy wife and I were the last to retire, and when we were about to go upstairs, our butler mentioned that one of our guests left in a hurry and was very upset. Having heard about what had happened at Lady Rhea\u2019s country house\u201d\u2014he shot a nervous look at Daemon\u2014\u201cmy wife went up to confirm that my \u2018friend\u2019 was in the guest room that had been assigned to her. She wasn\u2019t, of course, so my wife came to this room . . . and found her. I don\u2019t know what she could have been thinking. It was clear Vulchera was dead, but Rosalene touched the body. That\u2019s how she hurt her hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her hands?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Healer isn\u2019t sure.\u201d Another nervous glance at Daemon.</p><p>\u201cOr doesn\u2019t want to say. But she\u2019s tried everything and hasn\u2019t been able to heal the wounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look at them in a few minutes,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cExamining the body won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>*How do you know that?* Daemon asked on a private psychic thread.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him. Instead, she removed her flowing, calf-length black jacket and vanished it. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to air walk when you\u2019re in this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve walked on blood-soaked ground before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be, Prince, but you don\u2019t want the scent of blood on you. Not this blood.\u201d</p><p>He watched her walk into the room, standing on air a finger\u2019s length above the floor. He made sure he was standing the same distance above the floor before he walked into the room.</p><p>Jaenelle circled the body slowly. Once. Twice. Thrice.</p><p>He circled the body too, and was almost certain they weren\u2019t picking up the same information. At least, not all the same information.</p><p>If he\u2019d come across a body like this when he\u2019d lived in Terreille, he would have recognized there was nothing gentle about this death, despite there being no sense of violence in the room. That would have made him sufficiently wary to back away. Because it took more than control and power to do what had been done in this room.</p><p>Jaenelle crouched on one side of the body and stared at it. He crouched on the other side, trying to make sense of the pieces of information he could glean.</p><p>He put a Black shield around his hand, then reached for the shirt, intending to pull back the collar enough to see if there was a tailor\u2019s label.</p><p>Jaenelle grabbed his wrist. *Don\u2019t touch the shirt. I\u2019m fairly certain the spell wasn\u2019t triggered until she put the shirt on, but now that the silk has been saturated with blood, I think it will hook into any flesh.*</p><p>*My hand is shielded.*</p><p>She looked at him, just looked at him. A chill went down his spine.</p><p>Releasing his wrist, she held one hand above the witch\u2019s chest. The Twilight\u2019s Dawn Jewel in her pendant changed to Red edged with Gray. The Jewel in her ring was the equivalent of Ebon-gray with veins of Black.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t tell what spell she used. The power that flowed out of her felt like nothing more than a puff of warm air.</p><p>But when that power flowed through the fabric, silvery strands shone in the blood-darkened silk. Silvery strands that had nothing to do with clothing and everything to do with a different kind of weaving.</p><p>*Tangled web,* Jaenelle said.</p><p>The silvery strands faded.</p><p>*Can we remove it?* Daemon asked.</p><p>*No.*</p><p>*Can we destroy it?*</p><p>She looked grim. *Yes. It . . . offers the answer to destroying it. But the Darkness only knows what that will unleash.*</p><p>*Jaenelle . . . *</p><p>*We need to talk about this. About all of this. But not here. Not now. Right now, I want you to walk out of this room and close the door.*</p><p>*Why?*</p><p>*Wood and stone remember.*</p><p>He couldn\u2019t be understanding her. *You\u2019re going to use the Hourglass\u2019s Craft to recall what happened here and watch the execution?*</p><p>*Yes.*</p><p>*Then I\u2019ll stay with you.*</p><p>*No. I want you out of this room, Daemon. Now.*</p><p>And the Queen commands, he thought as he walked out of the room\u2014and wondered if his heart could bruise his chest, the way it was pounding.</p><p>What was it she suspected that she didn\u2019t want him to see?</p><p>It felt like he\u2019d been standing in that hallway for days, but when Jaenelle walked out of the room, he was fairly certain she\u2019d been inside less time than it had taken for Vulchera to bleed out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to burn the body,\u201d Jaenelle told Lord Collyn. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, that shirt will continue to be a danger to your household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we wait until the spell fades and then deal with the remains?\u201d Collyn asked.</p><p>\u201cThe body will rot before those spells fade,\u201d she replied sharply. \u201cUse Craft. Don\u2019t touch anything you don\u2019t have to. Build a bonfire,Warlord, because this has to burn. Use witchfire as well as natural fire. Both will be needed to break the spells. I\u2019ll leave a cleansing web Lady Yaslana and I developed to remove emotional residue from a room. That should make it possible for your people to be in the room long enough to take care of the physical cleaning.\u201d</p><p>Of course, it would be a long time\u2014if ever\u2014before any guest would willingly stay in that room, cleansed or not, Daemon thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow,\u201d Jaenelle said, \u201cI\u2019ll see your wife.\u201d</p><p>Blood seeped from fine lines on Lady Rosalene\u2019s hands, as if she\u2019d pressed down on wires that had cut deep into her skin. Except the skin wasn\u2019t cut. If you wiped away the blood, all that was visible were those silvery strands on the surface of her skin\u2014until the blood welled up again from those strands.</p><p>Rosalene had pressed her hands on the shirt. She had walked into the bedroom, seen the body, seen the blood, and grabbed that bitch Vulchera\u2019s arm in some shocked effort to help before she saw the reason there was no possible way to help.</p> <p>Silver strands. Like the tangled web that had been woven into that silk shirt.</p><p>Ignoring Collyn, who hovered in the doorway, not quite daring to come into the room, Daemon stood near Jaenelle and watched her clean the blood off Rosalene\u2019s hands again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried everything I know.\u201d The Healer was a middle-aged woman who sounded both frustrated and anxious. \u201cI\u2019ve tried every healing spell I know, but there\u2019s nothing to actually heal.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle called in a small, short-bladed Healer\u2019s knife and made a shallow cut in Rosalene\u2019s hand, following the path of one of those silvery strands. Setting that knife aside, she called in another and pricked her own finger.</p><p>Daemon snarled, a reflex to smelling his Queen\u2019s blood, to knowing her blood ran.</p> <p>A phantom caress down his back\u2014a caress that reassured enough for him to leash the instincts of a Warlord Prince.</p><p>As one drop of her blood fell on the shallow cut she had made in Rosalene\u2019s hand, Jaenelle said,\u201cAnd the Blood shall sing to the Blood. And in the blood.\u201d</p><p>The Healer wet a small square of cloth with a healing lotion and handed it to Jaenelle, who murmured her thanks\u2014and didn\u2019t grumble at him when he took the cloth and cleaned her pricked finger.</p><p>\u201cClean off her hands again,\u201d Jaenelle told the Healer.</p><p>The silvery strands showed once more, but this time when they faded, no blood seeped up through the skin.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think to do that,\u201d the Healer said.</p> <p>Jaenelle shook her head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have made a difference if you had.\u201d</p><p>*Because the spell was made to recognize your blood?* Daemon asked.</p><p>*And yours.*</p><p>\u201cI would recommend drinking a healing brew several times a day for the next couple of days,\u201d Jaenelle told Rosalene. \u201cThat will help your body regain its strength and replace the blood you\u2019ve lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take care of that,\u201d the Healer said.</p><p>\u201cThen I think we\u2019re done here.\u201d Jaenelle looked at him, clearly letting him make the choice.</p><p>He was more than ready to get out of that house, but he had duties as the Warlord Prince of Dhemlan.</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs some rest,\u201d he told Collyn, who was still hovering in the doorway. \u201cI\u2019ll return this afternoon, and you and I can discuss what happened yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>He escorted Jaenelle out of that room and down the stairs to the main floor . . . and escape.</p><p>*Daemon, I know you have duties, but I don\u2019t want to stay in this house,* Jaenelle said.</p><p>*We\u2019re not going to,* he said as they left the house and walked to the Coach. *Arrangements have already been made for us to stay at the estate house for as long as it takes to settle this.*</p><p>She stuttered a step. *Is that why Holt came with us? It seemed odd that Beale would assign a footman to look after us for a Coach ride, but I had other things on my mind.*</p><p>*Holt went on to the house to let them know we\u2019re coming.*</p><p>*Ah.*</p><p>She had seemed grimly calm while she\u2019d looked at the body. She had taken care of Rosalene\u2019s hands with her usual skill as a Healer.</p><p>So he wasn\u2019t prepared when she flung herself in his arms and held on with shuddering distress the moment they were safely inside the Coach.</p><p>\u201cJaenelle . . .\u201d He held her, not knowing what else to do\u2014and more unnerved by this reaction than he\u2019d been by anything else. \u201cJaenelle, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t want to talk about it yet, think about it yet. I don\u2019t want to be completely sober when we talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Mother Night. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you can tell me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were so haunted when she eased back enough to look at him. \u201cDo you know the story of Zuulaman?\u201d</p><p>They had a summer blanket tucked around them\u2014more for the idea of comfort, since it couldn\u2019t relieve what chilled them\u2014and they were both working on their third very large brandies before Jaenelle stopped shivering.</p><p>Daemon kept one arm wrapped around her. He would have preferred the privacy of the bedroom to a locked parlor, but he understood her choice. She wanted this conversation over with before they got into bed to offer each other some comfort and get some sleep.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not sane, Daemon.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d heard her correctly. \u201cYou think Saetan got so pissed off about this bitch that he decided to take a walk in the Twisted Kingdom in order to deal with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he decided anything,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cI think something about this shoved him over the border. Free fall into madness\u2014and the rage inside that madness is huge . . . and terrible.\u201d</p><p>He had walked in the Twisted Kingdom for eight years, lost in madness. He had lost none of his power during that time, but his madness had been self-destructive. If he\u2019d understood Jaenelle\u2019s reference to Zuulaman, Saetan\u2019s madness tended to look outward. Toward an enemy.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat did you see in that room?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThe spell in the shirt was an execution, a brutal kind of justice. He was in that room with her as the Executioner. But something changed toward the end.\u201d</p><p>Shivering, she tried to tuck herself closer to him. Since that wasn\u2019t possible, he put a warming spell on the blanket.</p><p>\u201cIt changed,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cIt became personal. For him. Personal enough to break something inside him.\u201d</p><p>She drained her glass, then used Craft to float the decanter of brandy from the table in front of the sofa. She filled her glass and topped off his before sending the decanter back to the table.</p><p>Daemon narrowed his eyes and considered the wobble as the decanter settled back on the wood. Then he considered his slightly glassy-eyed wife.</p><p>Yes, this was the first time she\u2019d tossed back enough liquor to feel the effects since she\u2019d healed and begun wearing Twilight\u2019s Dawn. She hadn\u2019t taken into account that since she no longer wore the Black, her body wouldn\u2019t burn up the liquor as fast.</p><p>So his darling was a lot less sober than she realized. Which meant he could ask the questions he didn\u2019t think she would have answered otherwise.</p><p>\u201cHe took Vulchera\u2019s head,\u201d he said, keeping his voice soothing. \u201cWhy did he take her head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all he needed.\u201d Jaenelle sipped her brandy. \u201cHe didn\u2019t break her Jewels, didn\u2019t strip her power. She\u2019ll make the transition to demon-dead. He\u2019ll make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . it\u2019s just her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich contains the brain, which contains the mind, which is the conduit to the Self. Or one of them, anyway. All he needs. He\u2019s going to finish the execution. She bled to death. Slowly. That was what the shirt was intended to do. Bleed her out. He would have sealed her into that room. She would have tried to get out, would have tried to get the shirt off. When she couldn\u2019t do either, when she knew she couldn\u2019t do either . . . There was so much fear in that room. Could you feel it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBleeding out because she put on a shirt.\u201d Jaenelle laughed, but it was a hollow sound. \u201cI imagine when they burn the body . . . Whatever spell that releases . . . I guess there will be a few men who will sleep better for whatever message rises from that fire.\u201d</p><p>There is nothing he has done that I couldn\u2019t have done, Daemon thought. So why am I so uneasy?</p><p>\u201cThat fear while she bled out, that was the first part of the execution,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cAfter she makes the transition to demon-dead . . . That\u2019s when the pain truly begins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She looked sleepy. Her body was relaxing against him.</p><p>\u201cBecause of you. This is about you, Daemon. About him . . . and you. That\u2019s why you need to be the one who helps him come back from the Twisted Kingdom. He\u2019ll answer you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to do that,\u201d he protested. \u201cI don\u2019t have any training to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need training. This is about fathers and sons. Lucivar needs to go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire, Jaenelle. Saetan is my father. Do you really think I\u2019ll need Lucivar there to watch my back?\u201d</p><p>She smiled gently. \u201cNo, think of his being there as stacking the deck in your favor.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly exhausted, and scared sick of what he might be facing, he rested his cheek against her head. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow after sunset,\u201d Jaenelle replied. \u201cHe\u2019ll be done with the execution by then, and I think he\u2019ll go back to the Keep after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d His breath came out in a shuddering sigh. \u201cCome to bed with me. Just be with me.\u201d</p><p>They went to bed for rest, for comfort. And as he went through the motions of the rest of the day, talking to Lord Collyn and dealing with the aftermath of the kill, he tried not to think about what might be waiting for him at the Keep tomorrow.</p><p>CHAPTER 27</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>\u201cPsst. Gray.\u201d</p><p>Gray tensed. When he\u2019d been in captivity, that sound usually preceded some boy\u2019s attempt to \u201cbefriend\u201d him so that he could be blamed for whatever mischief the boy and his friends had done.</p><p>\u201cPsst.\u201d</p><p>He turned toward the sound\u2014and wondered why Ranon was hiding behind the stone shed.</p><p>He moved toward the other man slowly, reluctantly. Ranon seemed hesitant, uncertain. That in itself was a reason to be wary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Ranon crouched and rested his hand above the ground. When he dropped the sight shield and revealed the wooden box, Gray rushed behind the shed to join him.</p><p>Plants. Lovely little plants ready for a garden.</p><p>\u201cI talked to my people,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cSome of the elders, along with the Queens, traveled to my home village to meet with me. To hear about the new Queen. I told them about Cassidy. I told them she knew about witchblood\u2014a plant that is not unknown in the reserves even though we\u2019d forgotten what it meant. I told them about the flower bed you wanted to plant for her. I mentioned that some of the flowers Cassidy\u2019s mother had sent looked similar to plants that grew in the southern part of Dena Nehele, so they sent these back with me. The Ladies sent notes with the plants.\u201d He called in several folded sheets of paper. \u201cThey said some are perennials, some are annuals. Some can winter over. They tried to give me more of a gardening lesson than I wanted, but I figured you\u2019d know what they were talking about.\u201d</p> <p>Each plant had a carefully written label attached to its pot. Gray touched each one gently, moved that strangers would be willing to help him make this special part of the garden.</p><p>He looked up, and was about to ask why Ranon was acting so uneasy about offering the plants. But when he looked into the other man\u2019s dark eyes, he understood the risk\u2014and the hope\u2014that had been carried with these plants.</p><p>Would someone from the house of Grayhaven accept plants that came from the Shalador reserves? Would the new Queen accept a gift from the Shalador people?</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThis will make the flower bed even more special.\u201d</p><p>Ranon\u2019s shoulders relaxed, and he smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready to plant tomorrow,\u201d Gray said. \u201cI just need to talk to Theran about keeping Cassie occupied for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t that be interesting?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what that meant, but judging by Ranon\u2019s amusement, he didn\u2019t think Theran would share the opinion that tomorrow would be \u201cinteresting.\u201d</p><p>Ebon ASKAVI</p><p>When Daemon arrived at the Keep at sunset, he didn\u2019t know what to expect.</p><p>What he found scared him to the bone.</p> <p>A sparely furnished room that was heavily shielded, but he couldn\u2019t tell if the shields were Black or had been made by a power more ancient than the Blood\u2014the power of the dragons, who had gifted the Blood with their magic long, long ago.</p><p>He also couldn\u2019t tell if the shields were meant to contain the man who waited for him in that room or contain the rage. The cold, dark, glittering rage.</p><p>He entered the room and walked toward the table that was set a few paces from the door. An awkward place for the thing, which made him think it had been placed there so that no one would have to cross the room under that feral gaze.</p><p>He moved toward the table and the man waiting beside it, and he swallowed hard. When he looked into Saetan\u2019s eyes, he saw the Warlord Prince who had destroyed an entire race so completely, there had been no trace of them left behind\u2014including the islands they had called home.</p><p>And he saw a truth about himself.</p><p>\u201cPrince,\u201d the High Lord said.</p><p>Oh, no. He had no chance of reaching the man if they kept to formal titles.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Daemon said\u2014and saw a flicker of emotion in those glazed gold eyes. He stopped when he reached the edge of the table, still out of reach of lethally honed nails\u2014and the venom in the snake tooth under Saetan\u2019s ring finger nail. \u201cFather, talk to me. Please.\u201d</p> <p>No response. Just a terrifying assessment being made by a powerful man who was walking who knew what roads in the Twisted Kingdom.</p><p>I can take him. If it comes to that, I\u2019m strong enough to stop him.</p><p>Strong enough to win\u2014maybe\u2014but not strong enough to come out of that fight intact. Not when he\u2019d be pitting a little extra raw power against thousands of years of experience.</p><p>Which made him glad Jaenelle had held Lucivar back instead of having both of them go to the Keep. One of them needed to survive to take care of the rest of the family.</p><p>If it came down to that.</p><p>Sweet Darkness, please don\u2019t let it come down to that.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Daemon said again.</p><p>Saetan looked at the table. Pressed the fingertips of his right hand on the polished wood. Two sheets of paper appeared beside his fingers.</p><p>Wary, Daemon took a step closer. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames,\u201d Saetan said, his voice a hoarse, singsong croon. \u201cThe names of men who didn\u2019t take the bait but were still caught by the trap.\u201d</p><p>Moving slowly, painfully alert in case a simple action gave offense, Daemon drew one of the sheets closer so he could read it.</p><p>Names and places.</p><p>He took her head, Daemon thought. All he needed. What kind of pain did the High Lord extract along with these names in order to collect the full debt Vulchera owed the people she had harmed?</p><p>\u201cWords that were said cannot be unsaid,\u201d Saetan whispered. \u201cBut sometimes hearts can forgive when a lie is revealed, and maybe, for some, the truth will let them hold what is most dear.\u201d</p><p>Daemon frowned at the list as he sorted through the layers of messages in those words. Marriages had been broken by Vulchera\u2019s games. There weren\u2019t many women who would forgive a husband\u2019s betrayal of the marriage bed, especially when fidelity was one of the things a man offered as part of the marriage contract. But Jaenelle was sure Saetan\u2019s slide into the Twisted Kingdom was about him and was personal. So if it wasn\u2019t about the wives and broken marriages, it had to be about the children.</p><p>Daemon pushed aside the chill of fear. He couldn\u2019t afford to have Saetan pick up that particular psychic scent.</p><p>Children. Dangerous ground where the High Lord of Hell was concerned.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to contact the families of these men?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Saetan\u2019s fingertips brushed the second sheet of paper. \u201cTheir lives were torn apart because of a lie. Because some bitch liked to play games.\u201d</p><p>The words started softly and ended in a savage snarl.</p><p>Who are we talking about? Daemon wondered\u2014and felt something shiver through him.</p><p>The rage still filled the room, but something else was building under the rage. Something that could be the spark that would light the tinder and unleash the High Lord\u2019s temper.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like,\u201d Saetan whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the agony a man can f-feel when he hears those three words: \u2018Paternity is denied.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>The hoarseness in that deep voice. As if Saetan\u2019s throat had been strained by the effort of keeping the rage in\u2014or by screaming to get some of the rage out.</p><p>Daemon had to choose. Had to commit to the fight. If Saetan lost control of that madness-driven rage, he had to strike without hesitation\u2014because hesitating would, most likely, leave him open to an attack that would cripple him enough to take him out of the fight . . . and leave Lucivar standing alone on the killing field.</p><p>\u201cFather. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>The silence held for almost too long.</p><p>\u201cWhen the burden of existing as demon-dead becomes too great, sometimes Hell\u2019s citizens will seek out the High Lord and ask him to finish what was begun,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cSo even though I wasn\u2019t informed by any of the Dhemlan Queens, as I should have been, I heard the story anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Daemon asked, watching Saetan\u2019s eyes become lifeless and blank of everything but a memory.</p><p>\u201cBy his own admission, the Warlord had flirted a few times with the idea of becoming another woman\u2019s lover, but he hadn\u2019t done anything that would force his wife into making a choice about their marriage. They had a son who had gone through the Birthright Ceremony and was irrevocably his by law. But they also had a little girl who hadn\u2019t gone through the Ceremony yet.</p><p>\u201cWhatever trouble he had with the woman, he adored the little girl, and it was for her sake that he trod so carefully when it came to his marriage vows.</p><p>\u201cA few months before his daughter\u2019s Birthright Ceremony, he went to visit a close friend for a few days\u2014an annual house party he and his wife had gone to for several years. But his wife didn\u2019t go with him that year because their boy was feeling poorly, so it was prudent to keep the children at home.\u201d</p><p>Daemon nodded, seeing where the next part of the story was going. \u201cVulchera was at the house party, playing her games. Did he take the bait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He came close to it because he and his wife were growing more and more unhappy with each other, but he walked out of the bedroom and went to find his friend. By the time they got back to the room, the bitch was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe denied being in his bedroom?\u201d Daemon said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. But his friend\u2019s wife told her to pack her things and leave, and that didn\u2019t sit well with the Lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent a shirt to the Warlord\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Saetan nodded. \u201cWith enough details about his body to make it clear she\u2019d seen him undressed. The day before she\u2019d set her trap, he\u2019d gotten a soaking during some game the men were playing and had stripped off his wet shirt\u2014which she had kindly offered to take into the laundry room, along with a few others.</p><p>\u201cThe marriage broke. He\u2019d played too close to that line too many times, and his wife had not been as unaware as he\u2019d believed. As sometimes happens, he began to regret the loss of what he\u2019d had\u2014including the woman, who hadn\u2019t seemed as exciting after she\u2019d become familiar. And there was his daughter, his little girl, to consider.</p><p>\u201cSo they tried to rebuild what had been broken. He wasn\u2019t living with them, but he visited every evening, doing chores he\u2019d previously resented, playing with his children. Talking to his wife and rediscovering the woman.</p><p>\u201cA month before his daughter\u2019s Birthright Ceremony, he\u2019d worked his way back to living at the family home half the time and had earned his way back into the marriage bed.\u201d</p><p>Daemon said nothing. Saetan\u2019s eyes still held that blankness, but Daemon felt a terrible something building under the words. Building and building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Warlord going to his friend had caused problems for the Lady\u2014the kind of problems that can be resolved only by relocating to another Province where her previous activities wouldn\u2019t be common knowledge. So she hired a young actress and purchased an illusion spell from a Black Widow to play a prank on a \u2018good friend.\u2019</p><p>\u201cThe Warlord was going to move back to the family home after the Birthright Ceremony. His wife had already told him she would grant paternity, assuring his rights to his daughter, but his formal return as husband and father would come after the Ceremony. So he wasn\u2019t at the house when the package arrived with the second shirt and a note that was skillfully written and indicated that the Warlord had been leaving his wife\u2019s bed and going straight to his lover\u2019s for some real pleasure instead of duty sex.</p><p>\u201cThe words were meant to cripple a woman\u2019s pride and kill a piece of her heart. In that, they succeeded.</p> <p>\u201cThat afternoon, the Warlord watched his little girl be gifted with her Birthright Jewel, and he waited for the last part of that ceremony that would give him back what he\u2019d learned he held dear.</p><p>\u201cThen his wife looked at him and said three words:\u2018Paternity is denied.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Saetan closed his eyes. \u201cThere are moments in a man\u2019s life when a decision is made, and once made, there is no going back, no changing it.\u201d When he opened his eyes, they were no longer blank. They were filled with a terrible, and growing, grief.</p><p>\u201cThe shock. The pain,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it feels like to hear those words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a stupid law,\u201d Daemon said.</p> <p>Saetan shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Considering the nature of Blood males, there are good reasons for that law. That was true when that irrevocable custom began, and it\u2019s still true. That law protects more than it harms. But it still . . . hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the Warlord?\u201d Daemon asked.</p><p>\u201cHe backed away. He saw the shock on the faces of friends and family\u2014people who had been aware of the reconciliation. He didn\u2019t know what happened, but he knew something had gone very wrong.</p><p>\u201cSo he backed away, but when he turned, she was standing there. And she laughed at him. That\u2019s all she needed to do. She laughed at him, laughed at his pain and his loss\u2014and something inside him broke.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t remember what happened after that. She laughed, something inside him broke, and the next thing he remembered was standing in the middle of a slaughter. The witch, the young actress who had been hired to wear an enemy\u2019s face as a prank, was dead. So was the Warlord\u2019s closest friend, two of his cousins . . . and his daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhen he saw his little girl . . . In that moment when he wondered, he dropped his shields, deliberately, and the blasts of power from other males fighting to defend friends and family ripped into his body and killed him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Daemon whispered. A terrible story, but he had the feeling that it was the crust holding back something even more terrible.</p><p>\u201cInsane rage\u2014and no memory of who had fallen by his hand,\u201d Saetan said. \u201cAnd the feeling, the fear, that he had killed his little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d</p><p>Saetan finally looked up, finally looked him in the eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d He smiled\u2014and the insane rage within that gentle smile was a living thing. \u201cShe had been trying to reach him, had been trying to protect him with her newly acquired Jewel.\u201d</p><p>Daemon felt tears sting his eyes and blinked them away.</p><p>\u201cHis blast of power took half her face. Part of her shoulder,\u201d Saetan said too gently. \u201cHe made the transition to demon-dead, and when he reached the Dark Realm, he begged for an audience. Then he begged me to finish the kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you give him mercy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I finished the kill, and he became nothing more than a whisper in the Darkness.\u201d</p> <p>Daemon\u2019s stomach rolled as another thought occurred to him. \u201cThe little girl became cildru dyathe, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did. But she didn\u2019t stay long. When I found her, I told her that her father loved her, and that he was very sorry she had gotten hurt, and if he could take that moment back and do it over, he would have walked away. For her sake. To keep her safe from what was inside him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could have been you, Daemon. She could have been you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at those gold eyes glazed with madness and took a step back.</p><p>Pain. Shock. A moment to make a choice before insane rage eclipsed all ability to think.</p><p>Manny\u2019s words, when she finally told him about his father.</p><p>So he left. Went to that house you keep visiting, the house you and your mother lived in, and destroyed the study. Tore the books apart, shredded the curtains, broke every piece of furniture in the room. He couldn\u2019t get the rage out. When I finally dared open the door, he was kneeling in the middle of the room, his chest heaving, trying to get some air, a crazy look in his eyes.</p><p>When Dorothea betrayed Saetan at Daemon\u2019s Birthright Ceremony, the High Lord had walked away. Because he had known the depth of his rage. Because the boy, like the girl centuries later, would have tried to reach the father, would have gotten caught in the fight.</p><p>Would have died.</p><p>Saetan\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cIt . . . could have . . . been you.\u201d</p><p>Here it is, Daemon thought. Here is the cascade of memories that sent a strong man tumbling into the Twisted Kingdom\u2014and almost ignited a cataclysmic rage.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think. Didn\u2019t have to think. He threw his arms around his father and held on as Saetan broke down and wept.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Father. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m well. You protected me that day. You walked away and kept me safe.\u201d And please, sweet Darkness, please don\u2019t let him think about what that boy\u2019s life had been like after that day. Not now. \u201cI\u2019m here, Father. I\u2019ve got you. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Choices. And taking chances.</p><p>While Saetan wept, Daemon quietly descended until he stood in the abyss at the level of the Black.</p><p>I am my father\u2019s son. Not much to distinguish between their psychic scents or their power. He was counting on that as he carefully created a link between Saetan\u2019s Black power and his own\u2014and began using his power to absorb Saetan\u2019s, draining them both in the process. Quietly. Carefully. It would leave them both vulnerable, but if he couldn\u2019t bring his father out of the Twisted Kingdom, Saetan wouldn\u2019t have a reserve of Black power, so he would end up tapping into his Birthright Red. Lucivar would be the dominant power coming into that fight\u2014and Lucivar would do whatever needed to be done.</p><p>Thinking of his own Birthright Ceremony and the moment of that betrayal, Daemon wondered how much strength and courage a man needed to take that kind of emotional gutting and walk away in order to protect what was held dear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Father. I\u2019m safe. You kept me safe that day.\u201d</p><p>Running out of time. Draining the power faster and faster, hoping he could drain enough.</p><p>Another shock as a flick of temper sizzled along that link.</p><p>Saetan had been aware of being drained. Had been aware all along\u2014and had let him drain the power instead of fighting.</p><p>Now the High Lord pushed back, shutting off his ability to drain the Black without turning the effort into a fight. Saetan also pulled away from his embrace, turning toward the door.</p><p>He and Saetan were still linked, mind to mind, but it wasn\u2019t an intrusive connection, more an emotional awareness now. Enough to tell him that his father was still on the wrong side of the boundary between the Twisted Kingdom and sanity. Enough for Daemon to feel bristling temper being added to an already messy emotional stew.</p><p>As he wondered what had changed, Lucivar dropped the sight shield and spread his wings slowly, giving him an intimidating physical presence.</p><p>How long had Lucivar been standing there? He hadn\u2019t sensed his brother. He\u2019d been too focused on his father. But Saetan had responded and had turned to face an adversary.</p><p>Red shield. Hell\u2019s fire, Lucivar needed more than that. Knew better than to come into a potential fight with less than his strongest shield.</p><p>Then Lucivar smiled the lazy, arrogant smile that always meant trouble, and Daemon realized the Red was simply hiding the Ebony shield in the Ring of Honor Jaenelle had given Lucivar years ago when she\u2019d been cornered into accepting him into service.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve upset your daughter,\u201d Lucivar said in the conversational tone that he usually followed with a fist in someone\u2019s face. \u201cYou remember her? Well, you\u2019ve upset her enough that she skipped over being pissed off about it and went straight to the scary kind of bitchy. You remember that mood? It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>There was still enough of a psychic link between them that Daemon felt Saetan\u2019s response to the emotional punch\u2014the equivalent of a fist in the gut. And through that link came one flash of memory. One image of a large golden spider, an incredible tangled web\u2014and one small strand of spider silk threaded with a chip of an Ebony Jewel.</p><p>Mother Night.</p><p>He tightened his own control, closed off more of his inner barriers. Now wasn\u2019t the time to share his own memories\u2014especially since neither he nor Saetan had missed the threat under Lucivar\u2019s words.</p><p>Lucivar held up a stoppered bottle. \u201cShe sent me here to give you this. It\u2019s a soothing brew. A few hours\u2019 sleep will help you regain your balance.\u201d</p><p>Saetan snarled.</p><p>Lucivar bared his teeth in a smile. \u201cNow, we could tussle about this, which, personally, I think would be fun, but that would get Jaenelle mad at all of us. So I\u2019ll just give you a choice.\u201d</p><p>No, Lucivar, Daemon thought. Not one of your choices.</p><p>\u201cYou can drink this and get some rest\u2014or I can let Daemonar loose in the library, unsupervised, and the only way you\u2019ll get your grandson away from all that old paper is by going through me.\u201d</p><p>Crackling tension\u2014and something more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Daemon felt Saetan recoil. Lucivar had drawn the line and would hold it with everything he had in him. And something about meeting Lucivar on a killing field was making the High Lord stumble away from that line.</p><p>Saetan sat on the table, called in a handkerchief, and blew his nose.</p><p>Cornered. Trapped.Nowhere for Saetan to turn that wouldn\u2019t bring him up against an adversary he didn\u2019t want to fight.</p><p>Grandson. Sons. Daughter.</p> <p>Jaenelle had chosen her weapons well.</p><p>\u201cYou prick,\u201d Saetan finally snarled. \u201cYou\u2019d really do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right I would,\u201d Lucivar said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to scare the shit out of your sons, you deserve to be threatened.\u201d</p><p>Good. Fine. Wonderful. Let\u2019s just start a pissing contest and threaten the High Lord of Hell while he\u2019s in the Twisted Kingdom and might not remember who we are. Damn you, Lucivar.</p><p>Except it worked. The madness-driven rage faded, replaced by exasperation and annoyed amusement\u2014maybe because no one but Lucivar would dare piss on the High Lord\u2019s foot.</p> <p>Saetan took those last steps across the border and walked out of the Twisted Kingdom. His shoulders sagged. He looked exhausted, but he rallied enough to hold out a hand. \u201cGive me the damn brew.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar pulled off the stopper and handed Saetan the bottle.</p><p>Saetan gulped down the brew and handed the bottle back. \u201cWell,\u201d he said several moments later, \u201cat least this brew of hers doesn\u2019t kick like a demented draft horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for you.\u201d Lucivar vanished the bottle and hauled Saetan to his feet. \u201cCome on, Papa. We\u2019ll all have a nice nap and then play round-robin snarling.\u201d</p><p>Daemon rolled his eyes and tucked a hand under Saetan\u2019s other elbow. Whatever was in that brew was hitting the High Lord hard and fast. They didn\u2019t bother trying to get him to his bedroom. The room they were in had a sofa long enough to accommodate a grown man, so they stripped off Saetan\u2019s tunic jacket and his shoes and settled him on the sofa, tucking blankets around him.</p><p>Barely awake, Saetan struggled to focus on them. \u201cLucivar . . .\u201d</p> <p>Lucivar grinned. \u201cNah. I won\u2019t let the little beast in the library until you\u2019re feeling frisky enough to chase him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pri\u2014\u201d</p><p>They watched their father sleep for a couple of minutes to be sure he really was settled.</p><p>Lucivar shook his head. \u201cShe said he\u2019d go down fast. I\u2019m glad she was right.\u201d</p><p>Daemon tipped his head, an unspoken question.</p><p>*Not here,* Lucivar said on a psychic thread.</p><p>They found another sitting room nearby. One moment, they were staring at each other. The next moment, they were holding each other, shaking.</p><p>\u201cYou stupid prick,\u201d Daemon said. \u201cWhat were you thinking of, drawing a line like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d Lucivar squeezed hard enough to leave Daemon breathless. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who left yourself open to every kind of attack. Hell\u2019s fire, Bastard. You didn\u2019t even try to shield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t take the chance of igniting his rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Daemon eased back enough to rest his forehead against his brother\u2019s. \u201cScared me, Lucivar. Seeing him like that. Watching you draw that line. All of it. Really scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared me too.\u201d Lucivar hesitated. \u201cYou would have killed him. If it came down to that, you would have killed him.\u201d</p><p>Daemon closed his eyes. \u201cYes. Would have tried to anyway. Actually, I figured the best I could do was weaken him enough before he crippled me, so that you would be able to finish it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to know.\u201d Another hesitation, then Lucivar said,\u201cWe\u2019re not the only ones who have scars. He hides his better than most men, but he\u2019s got some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He wasn\u2019t about to forget this particular scar anytime soon.</p><p>\u201cDaemon . . .\u201d Lucivar eased back a little more, but still kept his hands on Daemon\u2019s shoulders. \u201cThere\u2019s something I\u2019d like to ask you. If you can\u2019t tell me, I\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Daemon replied, not liking the wariness now filling Lucivar\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said about Jaenelle\u2019s temper riding the scary kind of bitchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the side of her temper a smart man would choose to tangle with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Witch\u2019s side of her temper. More than that. The look in her eyes . . .\u201d Lucivar shook his head, frustrated. \u201cFor a moment, when I looked into her eyes, it felt like the abyss had opened up right under me and . . . I haven\u2019t felt that kind of power since . . .\u201d He sighed. \u201cHell\u2019s fire. I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>Yes, you do, Daemon thought. Making a choice, he brushed lightly against Lucivar\u2019s inner barriers, asking to enter his brother\u2019s mind.</p><p>Lucivar hesitated a moment, then opened all his inner barriers, giving Daemon access to everything he was. Leaving himself completely vulnerable.</p><p>Daemon moved carefully and went deep because what he was about to give his brother was information that had to be kept secret.</p><p>When he reached the most protected part of Lucivar\u2019s mind, he offered two images: Saetan\u2019s memory of a tangled web that turned dreams into flesh, and his own memory of the Misty Place and a spiraling web of power\u2014the power Witch had chosen to give up in order to have a more ordinary life.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Lucivar whispered, his eyes widening. \u201cThen the power is still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould she claim it again?\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t Lucivar understand?</p><p>\u201cCould she survive if something pushed her into claiming it again?\u201d Lucivar asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if her body can still be a vessel for that much power. I think she could reclaim it . . . but I don\u2019t think she would survive very long.\u201d He swallowed hard. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to make sure she never has to make that choice.\u201d</p><p>Lucivar gave his shoulders a friendly squeeze. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure she never has to make that choice.\u201d</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Daemon huffed out a laugh that also held a few tears. \u201cI love you, Prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, Bastard.\u201d Lucivar stepped back and rolled his shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019re going to camp here today and keep an eye on him? Make sure he really is stable when he wakes up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s send a message to the scary little witch so she stops being scary, and then see what we can find to eat.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them would shake off the past hour quite that easily, but Daemon felt some of the weight slide off his shoulders. He smiled and slipped his hands in his trouser pockets. \u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 28</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>With his ears still ringing from Gray\u2019s yappy list of instructions, Theran knocked on Cassidy\u2019s door. He hoped she\u2019d still be taking a bath or otherwise occupied, so he\u2019d have a little more time to figure out what to say, but she opened the door before he decided to knock a second time.</p><p>\u201cPrince Theran.\u201d</p><p>Wary. Surprised to see him. And the look in her eyes told him plain enough that she remembered the other time he\u2019d come knocking.</p><p>\u201cMay I come in?\u201d</p><p>Hesitation. Then she stepped aside to let him enter her sitting room.</p><p>Who was with her? Not that it was any of his business. He was First Escort, not Consort, and the Queen could command the attention of any man in her court.</p><p>Except it would kill Gray if Cassidy had taken another lover.</p><p>\u201cAm I intruding?\u201d he asked when he heard some movement in her bedroom.</p><p>Her look said Of course you are, but she replied, \u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>Which was when Vae nudged the bedroom door open and joined them.</p><p>\u201cJust females here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray isn\u2019t here, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d Her voice had a snippy edge to it.</p><p>He knew that defensive tone. He\u2019d used it enough times in his youth when Talon had called him on something and he\u2019d tried to slide around admitting he\u2019d done something he wasn\u2019t supposed to do.</p><p>What did she think he was going to do if she was with Gray? Go running to the Keep to tell Yaslana so he could storm down here and pound on everyone?</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s exactly what she thought. They had to work to get along on their best days, and he had given her enough reasons to dislike him. But getting into an argument now would end with her stomping out to the garden, and that wouldn\u2019t make Gray happy.</p><p>Theran scratched his head and resisted the temptation to pull out some hair. \u201cLook, it\u2019s like this. Gray is putting together a surprise for you, and my part of the task is to keep you occupied for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>Her face tightened, the pleasure of learning Gray was planning a surprise gone before it had been fully realized. She took a step back.</p><p>He almost asked why she was acting that way when he considered what he\u2019d said and where they were.</p><p>\u201cNot that way,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, because the sun will shine in Hell before that happens.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t need to be so vehement about it. He gave a good accounting of himself in bed.</p><p>He bristled. Before he said something about the amount of work a man had to do in bed being in direct proportion to the attractiveness of his partner, he remembered why he\u2019d come to Cassidy\u2019s suite to begin with.</p><p>\u201cI thought we could go into town\u2014not for an official visit or anything like that, but to . . . I don\u2019t know . . . shop . . . or whatever females do.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Whatever females do\u2019? Haven\u2019t you ever spent an afternoon with a girl when you didn\u2019t want sex?\u201d</p><p>His temper slipped the leash, and he didn\u2019t try very hard to rein it in. \u201cI grew up in the rogue camps in the Tamanara Mountains, not in some comfortable village where girls flirt with boys in order to have a packhorse for the afternoon\u2019s shopping.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGirls don\u2019t need packhorses, you brainless ass,\u201d Cassidy snapped. \u201cWe\u2019re perfectly capable of carrying our own packages. You\u2019d know that if you spent any time talking to women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere weren\u2019t many women in those camps, and there certainly weren\u2019t fancy shops. We were there to fight, to protect Dena Nehele, to escape being enslaved by a Ring of Obedience and made useless to our people. So I don\u2019t have town manners, Lady. I didn\u2019t need them in the mountains, and Talon didn\u2019t waste time teaching me anything I didn\u2019t need.\u201d</p><p>He saw her effort to pull back, to assess. And he saw something he hadn\u2019t expected\u2014and didn\u2019t want: pity.</p> <p>\u201cMy apologies, Prince Theran,\u201d Cassidy said quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had such a difficult life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a good life,\u201d Theran snapped. \u201cI survived. A lot of men didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a mental step back, regaining control of his temper with effort. They didn\u2019t like each other. So be it. He didn\u2019t care if she understood him. Gray was stupid in love with her, and there was nothing he could do about it. He had to tolerate her as best he could because Gray and that damn contract with Sadi chained him to her.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to town or not?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Cassidy looked away. \u201cYes. Give me a few minutes to change clothes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the pony cart and meet you at the front door.\u201d Because he needed air and open space.</p><p>Because standing here in her suite, he had the odd sense that something delicate was being weighed down by their words and feelings\u2014and was about to break.</p><p>I survived. A lot of men didn\u2019t.</p><p>The words circled round and round in her mind.</p><p>Cassidy didn\u2019t want to get into a serious discussion, and Theran\u2019s stiff posture as he drove the pony cart into town didn\u2019t invite small talk. So she kept silent and absorbed the look and feel of the land during the short ride into town.</p><p>I survived. A lot of men didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Those few words told her more about Theran Grayhaven than she\u2019d learned in the past few weeks.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t want pity. He wasn\u2019t the only boy who had been taken into the mountains to be trained to fight. He wasn\u2019t the only boy who had been hidden from the Queens who had been corrupted by Dorothea SaDiablo. And there had been other boys who had suffered far more than he had.</p><p>Gray, for instance.</p><p>But she saw his quest for a Queen differently because of those words. It hadn\u2019t been as simple as having a Queen who knew Protocol and the Old Ways of the Blood. It had been about having a Queen who could dazzle, who could restore the heart in men weary of fighting\u2014men who might be asked to fight some more in order to restore Dena Nehele and then keep it safe from the Blood in the rest of Terreille.</p><p>The Queen was the heart of a land, its moral center.</p><p>Theran had needed a heart he could believe in without reservation. He hadn\u2019t found that. Not in her.</p><p>That was something she was going to have to think about. But not today. Today she would be a visitor from Kaeleer who was being given a tour of her host\u2019s home village. Today she would be Cassidy instead of a Queen.</p><p>Tomorrow was soon enough to think about who she would be in the days ahead.</p> <p>As they entered the town of Grayhaven, she reviewed a mental list of what she could use against what she could shop for with a man trailing along. Yesterday she would have dragged Theran into shops that were bound to make most men uncomfortable. Now she considered which kinds of places her brother, Clayton, had gone into without balking; she figured those probably wouldn\u2019t discomfort Theran either.</p><p>\u201cAny particular place you want to go?\u201d Theran asked, sounding like he\u2019d bitten into something sour.</p><p>\u201cLike tends to gather with like, so every town has communities. I would like to ride through the town and see as much of it as possible, but, for now, I\u2019d like to see the shops where the court usually makes purchases.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d made an effort to keep her tone \u201cinterested visitor\u201d instead of Queen. He eyed her for a moment, as if he knew something had changed, but he wasn\u2019t sure what.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>The shopping district had several carriage parks\u2014plots of land where conveyances could be left while people were going about their business. Each park had a couple of youths who kept an eye on the horses and would even deliver a carriage if its owner didn\u2019t want to walk back and claim it.</p><p>Since that took care of the pony cart, Cassidy was quick to suggest walking and wondered why Theran hesitated.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wonder long. The men who recognized Theran nodded in greeting, then jolted when they saw her and realized who she must be.</p><p>\u201cI gather the Blood here don\u2019t make a distinction between a formal and informal visit?\u201d Cassidy asked, stopping in front of a shop window. She wasn\u2019t paying attention to the merchandise; she just wanted a moment to ask Theran about this behavior.</p><p>Which was when she focused on a movement close to the window and caught a glimpse of the proprietor\u2019s face before the man rabbited out of sight.</p><p>Theran placed a hand on her elbow and tugged her away from the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat particular shop caters to men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say you were staring at things that most ladies pretend don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>Which made her sorry she hadn\u2019t been paying attention, because she had no idea what he was talking about\u2014and she was certain he wouldn\u2019t let her go back and look.</p><p>\u201cWhat distinction?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat was in that window?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIf ladies aren\u2019t supposed to know about it, why were those things in the shop window?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFormal and informal,\u201d Theran said, getting that Warlord Prince turning stubborn tone in his voice.</p><p>Fine. She\u2019d just make note of the shops nearby and she\u2019d come back with Shira one day soon.</p><p>\u201cWhen a Queen is going about her own business in her home village, she\u2019s treated like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, she might get a little extra attention from the shopkeepers, but the people we\u2019ve passed . . . I don\u2019t know how to respond to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know how to respond to you either,\u201d Theran replied. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of them has experienced an \u2018informal\u2019 visit from a Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Queens declared Protocol to go shopping?\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking. Since she didn\u2019t want to upset anyone else, she focused on his shoulder.</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d met him, she saw genuine amusement.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re standing in front of a bakery,\u201d he said. \u201cYou won\u2019t cause a scandal if you look in the window.\u201d</p><p>She knew her face was turning bright red, but she dutifully shifted positions so she could look in the window.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for a fact,\u201d Theran said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think any Queen has walked around this town informally in years. Might not be Protocol in the strictest sense, but the Queens didn\u2019t walk among the people casually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve never done that here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since Lia.\u201d</p><p>He frowned so fiercely after he said that, Cassidy ended up giving him a nudge with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cIf you keep glaring at those pastry things, you\u2019re going to turn the sweet cream sour,\u201d she said.</p><p>Oh, the expression on his face when he focused on what was in front of him!</p><p>His eyes slid sideways and looked at her. \u201cMaybe we should buy a few, just to save other folk from that soured cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should,\u201d she agreed too politely.</p><p>Boy. Bakery. Memories of Clayton, the time he\u2019d gone into a bakery with a fistful of coins and no parent to hold him back.</p><p>Ah, well. Theran wasn\u2019t eleven. Surely he had enough self-discipline to avoid eating himself sick.</p><p>When they entered the bakery, she wasn\u2019t sure if the baker was going to fawn or faint, but they walked out with a box of treats that Theran was more than happy to carry.</p><p>The morning was turning out better than he\u2019d expected\u2014although he probably shouldn\u2019t have eaten that last cream-filled pastry. But, Hell\u2019s fire, he\u2019d always had a weakness for the damn things, and it had been a long time since he\u2019d eaten one with any enjoyment.</p><p>Twelve years, as a matter of fact.</p><p>A boy who was hunted couldn\u2019t afford to have weaknesses\u2014or habits that people noticed and would share for the right price.</p><p>There had been a handful of villages near the Tamanara Mountains that had been considered safe ground. Places where the rogues would get supplies, visit lovers or whores, collect news. Armed camps of a different kind, where people were trusted because they were loyal to Dena Nehele rather than the puppet Queens.</p><p>But everything has a price\u2014including information about a boy with a weakness for cream-filled pastries.</p><p>Except, at fifteen, the lure of a woman proved stronger than the lure of a box of treats.</p><p>A young whore, not that much older than he was, who was willing to show one of the \u201cbrave fighters\u201d some pleasure. He and Gray had slipped away from their escort\u2014something that would have earned them a few licks of a strap if they\u2019d both come back that day\u2014so that he could romp with the girl. But he\u2019d wanted that damn box of sweets too, so Gray went alone to the bakery they visited every time they came to that village, even though sweets of that kind didn\u2019t have much appeal for him.</p><p>That too was known. Which was why the Queen\u2019s guards who caught Gray coming out of the bakery were sure they\u2019d captured Theran Grayhaven.</p><p>Gray still screamed when he saw one of those pastries, which was another reason it had been so long since Theran had tasted one.</p><p>None of which excused him from eating himself stupid this morning.</p><p>Still, Cassidy wasn\u2019t a torturous companion on a shopping trip. He\u2019d caught a few wistful glances from her as they passed shops where, given a choice of going in or being whipped, he\u2019d take the whipping, but she hadn\u2019t insisted on going inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sadi would walk into a shop like that, Theran thought as he waited for Cassidy to finish purchasing a few books. Hell\u2019s fire, Sadi wouldn\u2019t just walk into a shop like that; he\u2019d dominate the place and have opinions about satin and lace and the advantages of each when worn against a woman\u2019s privates.</p><p>Would Gray walk into a shop like that?</p><p>Cassidy turned away from the counter and studied him. \u201cYou look a little green.\u201d</p> <p>Well, wasn\u2019t that just fine?</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI guess males don\u2019t outgrow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutgrow what?\u201d Glad to be out of the stuffy shop, Theran took a deep breath. Didn\u2019t help. It was a fine summer morning, but it was starting to feel a bit too hot and sticky.</p><p>But that might have been him and not the weather.</p><p>\u201cPut a man in a bakery and he turns into a boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like Vae.\u201d Who was home sulking because he wouldn\u2019t let her come with them. The townsfolk had enough to contend with, having a Queen trying to act like she was one of them, without a yappy dog around telling everyone what to do.</p><p>Cassidy bit her lip and shook her head.</p><p>Damn. And the morning had been going well. For the most part.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost time for the midday meal,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a steak, and you need one. Choose a dining house, Prince.\u201d</p> <p>You turn Queen fast enough when you want something, Theran thought. But the idea of a steak\u2014and just sitting still for a bit\u2014had more appeal than he\u2019d first thought, so he led them to a dining house that had an enclosed courtyard for private outdoor dining.</p><p>The courtyard needed to be cleansed by a Black Widow. Blood had dined there\u2014and done other things there.</p><p>It was clear that the owners of the establishment had made an effort to scour away the past, so Cassidy said nothing to upset anyone. Such things were best done quietly anyway. And since they had been outlawed, finding a Black Widow might not be the easiest thing.</p><p>Maybe Shira would know how to get in touch with other Black Widows.</p><p>A task for another day, Cassidy thought. The food was excellent, and even though she was less comfortable than she might have been, she could see herself being a regular guest here.</p><p>As forTheran . . . Well, the steak was waging war on the pastries, and judging by the color of his skin now, the steak was winning. So was the way a man who wore a Green Jewel burned food.</p><p>She waited until he\u2019d eaten three-quarters of his steak. Then she reached over and snagged the rest with her fork.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Theran protested. \u201cI wasn\u2019t finished eating that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you were,\u201d Cassidy replied, setting that piece and the one she\u2019d kept from her own meal on her bread plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . ?\u201d Theran stared at her as she put the bread plate on the ground beside her.</p><p>\u201cThere you go,Vae,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>Theran\u2019s eyes widened and his jaw dropped as the Sceltie dropped the sight shield and gave him a tail-tip wag. She sniffed the steak and wagged her tail with more enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cWhen did she get here?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>\u201cShe caught up to us when we left the carriage park,\u201d Cassidy said, giving him a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d she avoid being stepped on when no one could see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrf.\u201d</p><p>Guess Vae is still sulking, Cassidy thought. At least where Theran is concerned.</p><p>\u201cShe can air walk,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cShe was trotting above us.\u201d She fiddled with her spoon and wondered how to ask a question she knew wouldn\u2019t sit well with a warrior. Especially a Warlord Prince. \u201cYou weren\u2019t aware of her, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. Were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But kindred have a different feel from the human Blood, and it takes practice\u2014and awareness\u2014to detect their presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re sight shielded and not yapping, they\u2019d be hard to find,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cGrf,\u201d Vae said, finishing the last bit of steak.</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have to sight shield to go undetected,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIf there were twenty Scelties in a yard, could you pick out the one who was kindred? Especially if you weren\u2019t aware of the existence of kindred? Kindred Scelties and horses lived around humans for a lot of years with no one realizing they were Blood. They don\u2019t reveal their presence unless they choose to, Theran.\u201d</p><p>She watched him absorb her words. Someone who wore a darker Jewel could have gone undetected and followed him, but he should have sensed a Purple Dusk witch who had been trailing him for hours.</p><p>A witch is a witch,Theran. Don\u2019t dismiss one because she looks different from you.</p><p>A lesson the Blood in Kaeleer were still learning when it came to the kindred.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to linger a little longer, since it was a lovely summer day. And now that Vae\u2019s presence was acknowledged, she thought the two of them could persuade Theran to show her a particular part of town.</p><p>How did I get talked into this? Theran asked himself. He knew how. Sure he did. Two females yapping at him. One of them even growled at him when he\u2019d refused to do this, and it wasn\u2019t Vae.</p><p>So here he was, driving the pony cart into the landen part of the town.</p><p>\u201cLandens usually have their own villages,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>Theran nodded to the guards who patrolled this part of Grayhaven. Two nodded back and mounted their horses to provide an escort.</p><p>\u201cMost still do,\u201d Theran replied, \u201cbut some landens were resettled as part of Blood villages after their own villages burned during the uprisings.\u201d And making them live so close to the Blood kept them on a very short leash.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean the Blood liked having a landen slum attached to their town.</p><p>Bitterness laced his voice as he looked at the shops they passed and the people who watched them. \u201cDamn landens are nothing but a boil on the town\u2019s backside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re people,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThey belong to this land, same as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey would have driven us out if they could. Took us two years to crush the uprisings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many died in those two years?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>\u201cMore Blood than we could afford to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many landens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cAll the more reason for me to see this part of the town.\u201d</p><p>Exactly the reason she shouldn\u2019t be there. But it was pointless to argue now that they\u2019d crossed that boundary, and there were other Blood wandering these streets.</p><p>Market day, Theran realized. When power\u2014and the unspoken threat of its being unleashed\u2014was another marker on the table, a few coins could buy a Blood family provisions for a week at the landen markets.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Cassidy asked, sitting up straighter.</p><p>\u201cA craftmen\u2019s courtyard,\u201d Theran replied, glancing in that direction. \u201cPotters, weavers, and others of that sort put out their wares. Some even work on a piece to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cTheran, stop the cart, I want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>*Theran? Theran!*</p><p>Shit. The little bitch would yap at him for the rest of the day. And Cassidy wouldn\u2019t be much better.</p><p>He gave the guards a psychic tap to alert them as he reined in.</p><p>Cassidy and Vae were out of the cart and walking back the way they\u2019d come before he could set the brake and tie off the reins.</p><p>One of the guards dismounted and came to stand at the horse\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on the cart, but you\u2019d best shield those packages. Lots of quick fingers here could lift a package and be on the next street before you know you\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the reminder.\u201d Theran put a Green shield around the back of the cart, then hurried to catch up to Cassidy. If the packages were stolen, it would give the Blood a reason to shake this part of town. If the Queen was injured . . . Well, he wasn\u2019t sure who would be going to war with whom, especially once Sadi andYaslana heard about it, but no matter who stepped onto the battleground, a lot of the town would burn before the fighting was done.</p><p>Cassidy had stopped before a weaver\u2019s table.</p><p>Family group,Theran decided. Man, woman, adolescent boy, and young girl. The man had a hard face and a look in his eyes Theran recognized.</p><p>Fighter.</p><p>\u201cThis is lovely work,\u201d Cassidy said, smiling at the girl. \u201cAnd this is yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes, Lady.\u201d</p><p>Cassidy stepped closer to the loom and the unfinished piece\u2014and the girl.</p><p>The man stiffened.</p><p>Theran descended to the depth of his Green Jewel and prepared to rise to the killing edge.</p><p>But Cassidy pointed at the loom, not touching child or work.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of pattern is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a traditional pattern, Lady,\u201d the woman said. \u201cDena Nehele has traditional patterns for each season. The girl is weaving a summer pattern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely colors,\u201d Cassidy said, directing her remarks to the girl. \u201cDid you choose them?\u201d</p><p>The girl nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou have a good eye for color.\u201d</p><p>By now the other merchants and their customers had stopped their own bartering to watch this exchange. A few had even sidled closer.</p><p>But not too close. One slashing look from him was enough to have them reconsidering the wisdom of getting too close.</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to sell this piece when it\u2019s done?\u201d Cassidy asked.</p><p>Tension flashed through the landens, the emotion so strong it surprised a growl out of Vae in response.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the man asked roughly.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019d like to buy it,\u201d Cassidy said, looking confused. \u201cAs I said, it\u2019s lovely work. The traditional design would appeal to my mother, so I\u2019d like to buy it for her as a Winsol gift. If you think it would be completed by then,\u201d she added, once more addressing the girl. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The girl nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe would be pleased to make a gift of it,\u201d the man said.</p><p>If you were any more pleased, you\u2019d choke on the words, Theran thought, hearing the man\u2019s anger and bitterness from being obliged over the years to provide a good number of \u201cgifts\u201d to keep his family safe.</p> <p>Bristling, Cassidy straightened to her full height. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no such thing. If the piece is being made to sell, then you should make a reasonable profit on it. Besides, it\u2019s not for you to decide. This is between me and the young lady.

Never!</p><p>But Theran saw the man\u2019s face turn white with fear, and he wondered what had happened to other landens who had gone up to the estate.</p><p>\u201cIs it a bargain?\u201d Cassidy asked, holding out a hand.</p><p>The girl glanced at her father, confused enough by the tension to hesitate.</p> <p>*You are supposed to shake hands now,* Vae said. *That is what humans do for bargains.*</p><p>Stunned looks all around as the people stared at the Sceltie.</p><p>*I like this human puppy,* Vae said, wagging her tail. *She has good smells.*</p><p>The woman clapped a hand over her mouth. Her eyes were bright with laughter. The man looked like he\u2019d been whacked in the head.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d Theran muttered.</p><p>A flash of humor in the man\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>Seeing the change in her father, and intrigued by a talking dog, the girl shook hands with Cassidy, sealing their bargain.</p><p>And that, thank the Darkness, would end this visit.</p><p>After bidding them all a good day, Cassidy headed back to the pony cart. She smiled at him as he fell into step beside her, as if nothing unusual had happened.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t, he realized. Not for her. This wasn\u2019t the first time she had purchased something from a landen.</p><p>What kind of place was Dharo that a Queen would shop in a landen village? Or was it that, wearing a Rose Jewel, Cassidy didn\u2019t feel as different from landens as the darker-Jeweled Blood?</p><p>He didn\u2019t have answers. Wasn\u2019t sure he wanted any. But he had to let the rest of the First Circle know about their Queen\u2019s potential for doing the unusual.</p><p>Vae growled. That was the only warning he had before he heard a child scream in pain and a man roar in outrage.</p><p>Theran spun around to meet the threat. When he saw the two adolescent Warlords standing a few paces away from the weaver\u2019s table, he hesitated.</p> <p>Cassidy didn\u2019t. She ran back to the landen family.</p><p>He\u2014and the guards\u2014felt the punch of Rose power and saw one adolescent Warlord get knocked off his feet. The other young Warlord staggered under the punch, but he wore a Summer-sky Jewel and was able to absorb most of Cassidy\u2019s strike.</p><p>Rose shields went up in front of the landens. Rose shields went up around Cassidy as she called in a round-headed club and settled into a fighting stance.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d A man old enough to be the Warlords\u2019 father ran toward them. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you a lesson, bitch.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire.</p><p>Theran took a step toward Cassidy, intending to yank her out of a fight she shouldn\u2019t have gotten involved in, since it wasn\u2019t Blood against Blood.</p><p>Then Vae launched herself at the man, and Theran saw a small dog who knew her Craft yank a full-grown man off his feet.</p><p>And heard bone snap as jaws enhanced by Purple Dusk power closed on the man\u2019s forearm.</p><p>The Summer-sky Warlord launched himself at Cassidy. Theran received another shock when Cassidy bared her teeth and met the attack, using the club with enough savagery to break through shields stronger than her own and drive the Warlord back.</p><p>By then Vae was beside Cassidy, Purple Dusk shields around them both.</p><p>*Theran? Theran!*</p><p>*Prince?* one of the guards said. *What should we do?* Damned if he knew. They shouldn\u2019t have been in this fight in the first place.</p><p>*I smell blood,* Vae said.</p><p>Of course you do, you little bitch, Theran thought. You bit a man and tore up his arm.</p><p>But Cassidy looked behind her, then screamed, \u201cSHIRA!\u201d</p><p>The Craft-enhanced sound probably wouldn\u2019t reach the estate, but it was going to shake up the Blood closest to this part of town.</p><p>\u201cYou hurt my boys!\u201d the older Warlord shouted as he got to his feet, cradling the broken arm.</p><p>\u201cThey hurt the girl,\u201d Cassidy snarled.</p><p>\u201cLanden slut,\u201d the Warlord snarled back.</p><p>\u201cGirl. I am the Queen here, and that makes her one of mine. And no one lays a hand on one of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen, is it? Rose-Jeweled bitch, you don\u2019t have the power to be a Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d Cassidy shifted her stance. \u201cYou want a fight? Draw the line.\u201d</p><p>The Warlord hesitated. Theran felt the guards recoil in shock.</p><p>And he saw everything he\u2019d hoped for going down in ruins because of Cassidy\u2019s foolish actions.</p><p>And he saw Gray breaking under the pain of losing her because she wouldn\u2019t survive this fight. Cassidy and Vae against those three Warlords? Even wounded, the males would rip the witches to pieces.</p><p>He hated her. In that moment, when he knew what he had to do and choked on the knowledge, he hated her.</p><p>But making a choice, he stepped across the boundary of that small battleground. \u201cIf you want to draw the line, you do that,\u201d he told the Warlord. \u201cBut you won\u2019t be meeting her. You\u2019ll be meeting me on the killing field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me.\u201d Ranon dropped the sight shield as he moved to guard Cassidy\u2019s left side, his Shalador blade flashing in the sun.</p><p>\u201cUs,\u201d Archerr said, flanking the three Warlords.</p><p>More sight shields were dropped. More blades flashed in the sun.</p><p>Except for Powell and Talon, the whole First Circle was there.</p><p>*How . . . ?Theran asked Ranon.</p><p>*Vae called us.*</p><p>The bitter anger in Ranon\u2019s thoughts made it plain that he thought the First Escort should have been the one to call the court to the Queen\u2019s defense.</p><p>Which was true.</p><p>\u201cI need Shira here,\u201d Cassidy said, glancing at Ranon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here. Drop your shield, Cassidy, so I can get to the girl.\u201d</p><p>More shields. Layers of them going up in front of Cassidy and curving around to close off the area where the landen family huddled.</p><p>Layers of shields formed by the Warlord Princes who served Cassidy.</p><p>But not the Green. His strength wasn\u2019t needed, and if he added it now, it would feel like a lie.</p><p>\u201cYou can drop your shield now, Lady,\u201d Ranon said.</p><p>The Rose shields behind Cassidy vanished. Shira rushed over to the girl, who was still wailing.</p><p>\u201cLet me have a look.\u201d Shira pulled the girl\u2019s hands away from her face. \u201cI\u2019m a Healer. I\u2019m going to help\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShira?\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Shira said. Then she looked at the girl\u2019s mother. \u201cGive me a hand. Come on, darling. Come back here with us.\u201d She hustled the girl to the back of the family\u2019s space, where they had a canopy for shade and a small table and chairs.</p><p>\u201cShira?\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cLet me work!\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s bad, Theran thought, remembering other Healers who had that particular tone in their voices.</p><p>\u201cThat Healer should be looking after my arm, not some slut\u2019s face,\u201d the older Warlord said.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s the one who threw the stone, I\u2019ll be happy to take care of his arm,\u201d Shira said. \u201cAnd I promise there won\u2019t be much left of it when I get done.\u201d</p><p>All the men, even Ranon, looked startled by the words. Cassidy just nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d the older Warlord said,\u201cI guess it\u2019s done. We\u2019ll be on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t done,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cEverything has a price, and your little bit of sport is going to cost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, look here . . . ,\u201d the Warlord began, taking a step toward Cassidy.</p><p>Blades were raised in warning. Cassidy and Vae bared their teeth and snarled.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the Queen\u2019s will?\u201d Theran asked.</p><p>Cassidy walked over to the loom and stared for too long before she turned back to the men.</p><p>\u201cThe weaving is ruined,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom the smell of it, there\u2019s horse manure along with some other muck. Since the streets are dry, the only way to make this kind of shit soup is by making it somewhere else and bringing it here.\u201d</p><p>A quick glance at the youngsters\u2019 faces confirmed it.</p><p>\u201cSo that ruined piece of weaving will cost you one hundred gold marks,\u201d Cassidy said, her eyes filled with a wild fury as she stared at the older Warlord.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d the Warlord yelled. \u201cFor that piece of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Vae snarled, and the sound rumbled through the whole street.</p><p>\u201cOne hundred gold marks as compensation for the lost work and as a penalty for not teaching your boys some manners. As for them . . .\u201d Cassidy\u2019s eyes focused on the two younger Warlords. \u201cTen days\u2019 labor, without using Craft, or ten lashes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle the whip if it comes to that,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll strip flesh from bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShalador bastard,\u201d the Warlord growled.</p><p>\u201cSince you understand the Shalador temper so well,\u201d Cassidy said, \u201cyour little bastards will work under Prince Ranon\u2019s supervision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you insult my boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen days or ten lashes,\u201d Cassidy snapped. \u201cChoose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not right, making my boys work like landens,\u201d the Warlord protested.</p><p>\u201cIt will help them appreciate what someone without Craft has to do in order to accomplish a task. Choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got no right!\u201d the Warlord shouted.</p><p>Something in the air. Something delicate being weighed down by words. Bending, bending. Almost breaking. If it broke . . .</p><p>Theran stepped closer to Cassidy. \u201cShe is the Queen of Dena Nehele. Her will is the law. You\u2019ve been given a choice, Warlords, and the Queen\u2019s First Circle stands witness.\u201d And may the Darkness help me, I stand witness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The feeling in the air was gone, as if a question had been answered.</p><p>\u201cTen days\u2019 labor,\u201d the Warlord said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bring the gold marks when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cThe three of you are forbidden to set foot in the landen section of this town. You come here again, you\u2019ll be exiled from Dena Nehele.\u201d</p> <p>The guards gasped. Even the Warlord Princes who supported her looked stunned.</p><p>\u201cYou will report to the Steward of the court and give the payment to him,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t come up with that much all at once,\u201d the Warlord said.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll work out a payment arrangement with the Steward\u2014and if you don\u2019t show up with the payment, the First Circle will be showing up on your doorstep to find out why.

Didn\u2019t know this Queen.</p><p>But he knew with cold certainty that he was seeing the Old Ways of the Blood, and that under the same circumstances, the Warlord Princes in Kaeleer wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do the Queen\u2019s will.</p><p>And he wondered for the first time if bringing the Old Ways back to Dena Nehele had been a mistake.</p><p>\u201cOne other thing.\u201d Cassidy stared at the two younger Warlords, finally settling on the one who wore the Summer-sky Jewel. \u201cIf the girl loses her eye because of the stone you threw, you forfeit a hand. This is the Queen\u2019s Justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQueen\u2019s Justice.\u201d</p> <p>It was a shout, a battle cry. And Theran heard his own voice raised with the others.</p><p>No more fight in the Warlords. No more thinking they could somehow slide out from under what they had done. The predators had gathered and were held by the Queen\u2019s leash. And by nightfall, the whole town would know for certain that these Warlord Princes belonged to Cassidy.</p><p>\u201cPrince?\u201d asked one of the guards who had escorted the pony cart.</p><p>\u201cPrince Ranon is the Master of the Guard\u2019s second-in-command,\u201d Theran said, nodding to Ranon, acknowledging another truth.</p><p>\u201cEscort those three back to their home,\u201d Ranon told the guard. \u201cPrince Archerr will assist you.\u201d</p><p>The guard glanced at Cassidy. \u201cI\u2019ll inform the others of the Queen\u2019s command. We\u2019ll make sure these Warlords don\u2019t come back to this part of town.\u201d</p><p>The Warlords were led away.</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d</p> <p>At the sound of Shira\u2019s voice, they all turned.</p><p>Cassidy looked at Shira, then past her.</p><p>\u201cThe rock came damn close, but it didn\u2019t take the girl\u2019s eye,\u201d Shira said. \u201cI can\u2019t say for sure yet that there isn\u2019t any damage. There was lots of muck and grit in the eye, plus the cut just beside it from the rock. But I\u2019ve got the eye cleaned out and have the first stage of healing salves on the injury. I gave her a sedative. I\u2019ll give her mother another dose for the girl, since her face is going to hurt and sleep will help her heal. I\u2019ll come back tomorrow morning for the next stage of the healing.\u201d</p><p>The man stepped forward. \u201cLady, if we\u2019d sold that piece in the market, we would have asked for fifty silver marks and been happy to have gotten thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday it was worth one hundred gold marks,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>Theran felt her shudder. That was the only warning he had before her legs buckled.</p><p>He grabbed one arm. Ranon grabbed the other.</p><p>\u201cFetch a chair,\u201d the man told his son.</p><p>The youth darted under the canopy and came back with a chair. They dumped Cassidy in it and pushed her head down.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d Shira asked. \u201cIs she hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel wobbly,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cKeep your head down,\u201d Theran said, tugging the club out of her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never attacked anyone before,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cLucivar taught me how to use the club. He said I didn\u2019t have the right temper for a knife. I worked on the moves lots of times in practice\u2014Lucivar has a lust for practice\u2014and I kept practicing because it was good exercise and a kind of mental discipline. But I\u2019ve never hit anyone before and meant it. Well, my brother, Clayton, but that\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finding anything,\u201d Shira said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst-fight nerves,\u201d Ranon said. \u201cShe\u2019s just shaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a bit of something that might help that,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Theran exchanged a look with Ranon. They both knew about the \u201cbit of something\u201d that was brewed in stills and cost a lot less than the liquor that didn\u2019t require a man to bring his own container.</p><p>*It will fuzz her nerves,* Ranon said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Theran said as he rose to follow the man.</p><p>The flask was tucked away with the water jugs and makings for tea. The man took a cup and saucer, then filled the cup halfway from the flask. He glanced at Theran, then poured a bit more.</p><p>Theran accepted the cup and took a sip. His eyeballs sang and his teeth danced.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d he wheezed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s got some bite to it,\u201d the man agreed.</p><p>When he brought the cup over, Cassidy got a whiff of the stuff and refused to drink it until Shira snapped, \u201cYou can drink that tonic or I can make you one that tastes worse.\u201d</p><p>She gulped it down, draining the cup.</p><p>Her throat didn\u2019t catch on fire, and her lungs didn\u2019t explode.</p><p>Theran wasn\u2019t sure if he should admire her for that or be afraid of her.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute to check on the girl,\u201d Shira said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll ride with you and help you get Lady Cassidy home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm aright,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d Theran replied as he hauled her to her feet.</p><p>Vae was stretched out on the seat, looking quite pleased with herself. Theran dropped the Green shield around the packages and said, \u201cIn the back.\u201d</p><p>She grumbled a bit, but she stepped over the seat and walked on air while she nudged packages around until she\u2019d made a Sceltie-sized spot. Then she lay down with a sigh.</p><p>Cassidy was more of a handful since the liquor and the fight were catching up to her and coordination became a vague concept. But he finally got her on the seat and wrapped a Green shield around her to keep her from falling out of the cart.</p><p>When he turned to find out what was keeping Shira, he saw Ranon holding the Healer back\u2014and the landen man standing within reach.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got something to say to you,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Theran stiffened. \u201cThen say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened today . . . What those boys did . . . That\u2019s happened before. Not to me and mine, but to others.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cBeen a long time since someone looked at us and saw people instead of less.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again, not knowing what to say or what this man wanted.</p><p>\u201cI fought in the landen uprisings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Theran replied.</p><p>The man glanced at the cart. \u201cIf there had been someone like her around two years ago, maybe we wouldn\u2019t have felt the need to fight. I just wanted you to know that.\u201d</p><p>His throat closed. Something ached inside of him. He raised a hand in farewell, then climbed up to the seat. A moment later, Shira joined him, and they drove away with Ranon riding behind them as escort.</p><p>\u201cExciting day,\u201d Shira said.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Too many things had happened too fast. There were too many things to think about.</p><p>And he wasn\u2019t sure how he felt about any of them.</p><p>CHAPTER 29</p><p>KAELEER</p><p>Daemon shifted the wooden delivery box to one hand and knocked on the cottage door.</p><p>He understood Jaenelle\u2019s reason for waiting in solitude. Witch would not have been an easy companion last night, and Witch wouldn\u2019t have been soothed by the company of all the women who had rallied around Marian. Lucivar had placed the Eyrien warriors on alert, and that had been enough warning for the women. For the warriors, seeing Lucivar go to the Keep armed and shielded told them everything they needed to know. If a fight broke out at Ebon Askavi between the three strongest Warlord Princes in the Realm, it would shake the whole damn valley. Or worse.</p><p>So the Eyrien women had gathered to keep Marian company, to keep Daemonar distracted. To wait.</p><p>But the Queen would have waited in silence, in solitude. Because if she\u2019d felt the need to reclaim what she had given up, she would have terrified all of them.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure who\u2014or what\u2014would open the door, and he began to worry when she didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Then the door opened and Jaenelle stood there, studying him with those haunted sapphire eyes that always saw too much.</p><p>\u201cWhy were you knocking?\u201d she asked, the tension visible in her stance\u2014and audible in her voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause this is your private place.\u201d</p><p>Like his suite of rooms at the Hall.</p><p>Relaxing, she nodded, acknowledging his reason. \u201cWhat did you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA loving man\u2014and breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched, fighting a smile. \u201cIn that case, Prince, come in.\u201d</p><p>He was so glad to see her, he didn\u2019t try to fight a smile. There were shadows under her eyes, testimony of a sleepless night, and her hair was sticking up every which way, making her look like a scruffy waif . . . who was wearing snug trousers and one of his silk shirts.</p><p>Screw breakfast, he thought as he set the box on the table. I\u2019ll just nibble on her for an hour or two.</p><p>Then Jaenelle peered into the box and her stomach growled so loudly, he figured it was prudent to change his priorities.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d Jaenelle asked.</p><p>\u201cI stopped at The Tavern after seeing Lucivar home. There\u2019s a steak pie, a vegetable casserole, and some fruit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Tavern isn\u2019t usually open this early.\u201d</p><p>Daemon hesitated, then wondered why he bothered. She would have been aware of the mood of the Blood in Riada. \u201cThey were just closing when I got there.\u201d Merry and Briggs had stayed open because so many had been sleepless and uneasy last night, and a gathering place offered comfort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached into the box for the steak pie. \u201cThe food needs to be warmed a bit.\u201d</p><p>Her hands settled over his, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cDaemon, why don\u2019t you say what you need to say? The food will settle better on an easy stomach\u2014and an easy heart.\u201d</p> <p>He removed his hands from the box and slipped them into his trouser pockets. He wanted to hold her, but he chose to keep the table between them.</p><p>\u201cI am my father\u2019s son,\u201d he said.</p><p>She tipped her head. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to you, Prince. You\u2019re more than his son. You are your father\u2019s mirror.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. But despite all the things I\u2019ve done, that wasn\u2019t as clear to me before as it was last night.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath, then let it out slowly. He and Lucivar had taken shifts, one standing watch while the other rested, and during one of those vigils, as he replayed that dance with Saetan, he\u2019d acknowledged a difficult truth.</p> <p>\u201cLast night I saw the man who had destroyed an entire race, and I understood something about myself. That kind of rage is in me, Jaenelle, in a way it\u2019s not in Lucivar. I am capable of doing what Saetan did to Zuulaman, and unlike my father, I wouldn\u2019t need to be drowning in grief or insane rage before I made that choice. Given the right provocation, I could do what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>That stopped him, had him rocking back on his heels. When he\u2019d first met her, those sapphire eyes had looked through him and she had made some decision about him, passed some judgment. Had she known then, at twelve, the depth of his temper, his potential for violence?</p><p>Probably.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you love me,\u201d he said, \u201cdespite what I am.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle walked around the table and took his face in her hands. \u201cNo, Daemon. I love you because of what you are. Because of all that you are. Right now, you\u2019re feeling raw, which is understandable, and you\u2019re shining a light on one truth about a complex man and not seeing the rest. So I\u2019ll see the whole of who you are and not let you shine a light on one part for too long.\u201d</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around her. \u201cDo you know how much I love you? How much I need you?\u201d</p><p>Her arms twined around his neck. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you show me\u2014\u201d</p><p>His stomach growled.</p><p>\u201c\u2014after breakfast?\u201d she finished, laughing.</p><p>They ate, they slept, they made love. When they were heating up the remainder of the food for a midday meal, Daemon said, \u201cYour strategy was quite brilliant. In case you were wondering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrategy?\u201d Jaenelle said, setting two plates on the counter in anticipation of simply dividing the food.</p><p>\u201cHaving Lucivar draw that particular line.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a puzzled look. \u201cI told Lucivar to give Saetan a nudge that would remind him of his family as it is, here and now. You would be able to get him to the border, but that reminder is what Saetan would need to take those last steps out of the Twisted Kingdom.\u201d</p> <p>Daemon laughed. \u201cWell, it was a damn good bluff, threatening to toss Daemonar into the library unsupervised and let him at the books.\u201d</p><p>Jaenelle dropped the silverware. \u201cWhat? Lucivar said what?\u201d</p><p>Daemon turned away from the stove and studied Jaenelle\u2019s pale face.</p><p>\u201cThat was your bluff, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Daemon asked, feeling the blood draining out of his head.</p><p>\u201cI would never threaten Papa that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaemon? Daemon!\u201d</p><p>One moment he was standing by the stove. The next moment he was sitting on the floor with Jaenelle kneeling beside him.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t your idea?\u201d he asked weakly.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cLucivar is Eyrien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe wears Ebon-gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t bluff.\u201d</p><p>She plopped on the floor beside him. They sat there for several minutes before she said, \u201cDid Saetan think it was a bluff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did\u2014at least after he woke up and thought, as I did, that you had told Lucivar to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>They pondered that for a few more minutes while their meal got cold.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jaenelle finally said, \u201chow long do you want to wait before we explain this to Papa?\u201d</p><p>No point having children who could match a man\u2019s temper if they weren\u2019t going to be a pain in the ass on occasion.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give him a couple of days,\u201d he said. \u201cBy then he won\u2019t be expecting anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s mean,\u201d Jaenelle said. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>Picturing the look on Saetan\u2019s face when he discovered the library threat had been Lucivar\u2019s idea, Daemon wrapped his arms around Jaenelle, lay back on the kitchen floor\u2014and laughed.</p><p>CHAPTER 30</p><p>TERREILLE</p><p>Shira walked into the Steward\u2019s office and shook her head in response to the men\u2019s unspoken question. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t answer the door, and Vae says Cassidy still doesn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Gray said, hugging himself. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in a fight, Gray,\u201d Theran said. \u201cThat\u2019s bound to unsettle anyone, and it would be more unsettling for a Queen.\u201d</p><p>A hard look from Ranon and an equally hard look from Talon, who had delayed going to his room when the sun rose in order to hear the morning report.</p><p>Since they\u2019d come back from town three days ago, Cassidy hadn\u2019t left her suite, claiming to be unsettled by the fight\u2014a fight Theran could have ended before it began.</p><p>Should have ended.</p><p>Talon had made that abundantly clear when he\u2019d heard their account of what had happened.</p><p>And Gray . . . Since the two young Warlords were working on the estate to pay off their debt of ten days\u2019 labor, Gray had turned into a merciless taskmaster, and Ranon\u2019s job wasn\u2019t supervising the Warlords so much as holding Gray back and providing some balance.</p><p>Theran didn\u2019t know what to think, didn\u2019t know what to do. Cassidy hadn\u2019t been hurt, hadn\u2019t been harmed. Not really. Shaken up, sure, but not harmed.</p><p>Except she hadn\u2019t left her suite since it happened, hadn\u2019t talked to any of them.</p><p>Not even Gray.</p><p>What in the name of Hell was she thinking?</p><p>Cassidy brushed her fingers over the cover of each journal, as if touch could be a conduit, and wisdom would seep into her fingers from the leather.</p><p>She had been hiding in her room for the past three days. It was time to stop hiding. Time to do the right thing.</p><p>Lia had revealed her heart in the journals, but Cassidy had found no wisdom that would help a Queen who didn\u2019t belong. Could never belong. She\u2019d shocked her court, shocked the Blood in the town. Hell\u2019s fire, she\u2019d even shocked the landens by standing up for them. What had made her think she could rule these people when she saw and thought about things so differently from them? And what made her think any of them would accept the way she thought about things? She wasn\u2019t Lia. Could never be Lia.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had found some of the journals from when you were my age,\u201d she said as she stacked the journals and set them on one side of the bed. \u201cI wish . . .\u201d</p><p>She opened the trinket box and took out each piece of jewelry. Memories. Family heirlooms. Talismans of a life filled with love. She would give the jewelry to Theran, along with the journals\u2014and her resignation. This time, she wouldn\u2019t wait for the court to resign from her. She\u2019d release these people from their unwilling loyalty, and she\u2019d go home before the roots she\u2019d begun putting down sank in too deep.</p><p>Before going would hurt as much as staying.</p><p>She put each piece of jewelry back in the box, one by one. Would Theran let her take one as a keepsake? Would she have the courage to ask him?</p><p>Her lower lip quivered and her vision blurred. She pressed her lips together hard enough to stop the quiver, then blinked back tears.</p><p>Just go. Just get it done.</p><p>She picked up the trinket box, intending to set it on the desk while she wrote the letter that would dissolve her court. She heard the crack as the bottom of the box broke and fell, spilling the jewelry over the bed.</p><p>\u201cHell\u2019s fire,\u201d Cassidy muttered, shaking her head. Something else she couldn\u2019t do right.</p><p>When she picked up the bottom of the box to see if it could be repaired, she discovered it was made of two thin layers of wood.</p><p>Then she discovered the paper that had been hidden between those layers.</p><p>And when she opened the paper, she found the map\u2014and another key.</p><p>*There are bad smells up here.* Vae pressed against Cassidy\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The psychic onslaught was bad enough for her. Who knew what else the dog might be sensing?</p><p>The attic was a graveyard of furniture. Nothing physically wrong with most of it from what she could see, but the psychic scents that had been absorbed by the wood\u2014the pain and despair or the gleeful cruelty\u2014had probably reached a saturation point where no one could stand being in the same room with the stuff.</p><p>Of course, piling it up here in the attic got the furniture out of sight but did nothing to cleanse the house. The weight of emotions pressed down on everyone living here, and most likely, none of them realized why.</p><p>Why would they? Cassidy thought. Theran and his family had returned to Grayhaven shortly before bringing her here, the rest of the court hadn\u2019t lived here before, and the servants were probably so used to these feelings, they had no reason to think things might be different.</p><p>They could be different. There were cleansing spells that could remove psychic residue from an object. Shira might know some, and if she didn\u2019t, Cassidy could ask Jaenelle and send the information back to Shira.</p><p>\u201cAnd if that doesn\u2019t work, burn the damn stuff,\u201d Cassidy muttered.</p><p>*Fire?* The Sceltie sounded much too eager to use witchfire to take care of the bad smells.</p><p>\u201cNot up here.\u201d Crouching, Cassidy held up the key. If Vae had been able to find the hiding place under the bed by smelling a key, maybe she could find what this key opened. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the thing that fits this key, that has the same smell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vae sniffed the key. *Not much smell, even for kindred.*</p><p>Damn. Well, she hadn\u2019t expected this to be easy. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s see if we can find the starting point that\u2019s shown on the map.\u201d</p><p>Grayhaven was a big mansion, so there were several ways up to the attic, and the map, by accident or deliberate omission, didn\u2019t indicate direction. So she was hot and dusty, and Vae\u2019s tail was veiled in cobwebs, by the time she found the attic entrance that looked like the starting point for this stage of the treasure hunt.</p> <p>Of course, that assumed no one had removed or added windows in the past few centuries or made other structural changes to the house. And the map had been made long before generations of furniture had been disposed of by tossing it up here.</p><p>Cassidy tipped the paper toward the light to read the small print around the section of the attic that had been marked as the end of the search.</p><p>\u201cWe need to find a large wardrobe that has a mirror beside it and a clothes trunk in front of the mirror.\u201d She looked around at all the discarded furniture. \u201cHell\u2019s fire, Lia. Didn\u2019t you consider that someone else might toss a trunk or two up here?\u201d</p><p>The attic had been divided into sections. The interior walls didn\u2019t go all the way up to the roof, but they did offer sufficient privacy. Would she find remnants of servants\u2019 quarters at the other end of the attic, or would she find more out-of-reach shelves?</p><p>\u201cShe tells me the number of paces from here to the treasure if I walk in a straight line,\u201d Cassidy muttered. \u201cSo were the walls here then, and she assumed whoever was searching would use Craft to pass through the wood, or were the walls added later?\u201d</p> <p>*Cassie?*</p><p>\u201cDo we walk in a straight line as the map indicates, going through the walls and furniture?\u201d Cassidy asked, more as a question to herself.</p><p>*No.* Vae shook herself. *Don\u2019t want to walk through the bad smells.*</p><p>The dog had a point. Cassidy was feeling mucky enough just being near this furniture. The thought of passing through it and having some of that psychic residue cling to her was nauseating.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. I guess we do this the hard way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not in her room,\u201d Shira said when she returned to the Steward\u2019s office later that morning. Talon had gone to his room for some rest, which was a relief to her, but Powell, Ranon, Theran, and Gray were still waiting for her report.</p> <p>Gray hugged himself. \u201cCaptured?\u201d</p><p>The sharp look Ranon gave her said he was wondering the same thing. The fact that any of them would ask that question now . . .</p><p>She could almost feel Dena Nehele dying around her.</p><p>Shira shook her head. \u201cNo sign of struggle. No feel of anything wrong.\u201d She hesitated, then decided against mentioning the old, broken trinket box on Cassidy\u2019s bed. Might have been an heirloom Cassidy had brought with her, but Shira didn\u2019t think so. She\u2019d been tempted to pick up one of the books that had been on the bed as well, but when she\u2019d reached for one, she\u2019d had the feeling that the moment she touched one, something important would go away, would be lost.</p><p>Because it wasn\u2019t time for her to touch one or read whatever was inside.</p><p>When a Black Widow sensed that kind of warning, she heeded it\u2014especially when a friend was suddenly, and mysteriously, missing.</p><p>Which was why she had put locks and shields around Cassidy\u2019s rooms. Until they knew what had happened to the Queen, she wasn\u2019t taking a chance of anyone upsetting a delicate balance.</p><p>\u201cDid you try contacting her on a psychic thread?\u201d Theran asked.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t you? Shira wondered as she nodded. \u201cNo answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she didn\u2019t\u201d\u2014Theran glanced at Gray\u2014\u201cpack up?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Poor Gray. Cassidy\u2019s retreat from all of them had been hard on him. Now Shira could see him breaking down, little by little, as the possibility of Cassidy disappearing for good began to take root.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, trying for a bracing tone and hoping no one\u2014except Ranon\u2014heard the worry, \u201cat least we know Cassidy isn\u2019t alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d Ranon asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t find Vae either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess when you get rid of a wardrobe, the mirror and trunk go with it,\u201d Cassidy said, rubbing her forehead with a grimy hand as she studied the latest combination of furniture. Why hadn\u2019t she thought to bring a jug of water? She was parched, and Vae was panting.</p><p>I\u2019m certainly not going to tell anyone I didn\u2019t bring any water. Lucivar can\u2019t yell about what he doesn\u2019t know.</p><p>It was tempting to give up, since they had circled and wandered the damn attic long enough to have crossed their own footprints a few times, but the answer was up here. Somewhere.</p><p>*Tired, Cassie,* Vae said.</p><p>And there were times when sense should override a foolish need to do one thing right.</p><p>\u201cMe too. Last one. If we don\u2019t find anything this time, we\u2019ll go downstairs and get some help looking.\u201d Maybe they could just pitch every mirror, trunk, and wardrobe onto the lawn until they found the right one. And Theran could damn well help with the pitching and searching. After all, this was his inheritance, not hers.</p><p>Taking a deep breath\u2014and coughing from the dusty air\u2014Cassidy crouched in front of the trunk and warily held out a hand. Some of the trunks . . . Whatever they contained was so vile, she couldn\u2019t get near them without feeling sick. This one . . .</p><p>Expectation. Anticipation. An odd feeling of hope.</p><p>She slipped the key into the trunk\u2019s lock . . .</p><p>. . . and the wardrobe door opened.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s clever.\u201d She pulled the wardrobe door open a little more, then pushed the nearest box of whatevers against it to hold it open before she created a ball of witchlight.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a room,\u201d Cassidy whispered. She stepped back and looked at the discarded furniture and boxes. Part real and part illusion? Had to be, but she wasn\u2019t sure her hands would be able to tell the difference, even now when so many centuries had passed since that spell had been cast.</p><p>\u201cVae, you stay out here.\u201d</p><p>*Why?*</p><p>\u201cBecause if that door closes and I get trapped in there, you\u2019ll need to find Theran and rescue me.\u201d</p><p>Vae sat down, wagged her tail in agreement\u2014and sneezed.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what Lia left for her heirs.\u201d</p><p>Trunks lined two of the walls. Sturdy shelves rose above them, filled with boxes and bags\u2014and more journals. The third side, to her left, had racks for storing paintings.</p><p>She pulled out the first painting, easing away the protecting cloth\u2014and wondered how a portrait of Theran had gotten up there. Then she uncovered the next painting and saw the same man, older. His arms were around a woman who wasn\u2019t pretty, but had her own kind of beauty.</p><p>Jared and Lia.</p><p>She wanted to uncover the rest of the paintings, wanted to spend hours studying these people who were still the heart of their land. But Theran and Gray should have the pleasure of that discovery, so she replaced the cloths over the paintings and began to check the shelves to get an idea of what was there before she went downstairs to tell the others what she\u2019d found.</p><p>Bags of gold and silver coins. Even a few gold bars. Loose gemstones. Enough, she judged, to repair the estate and support a prudent Queen\u2019s court for several years so that the tithes could be put back into the Provinces and villages, helping Blood and landens alike to rebuild Dena Nehele.</p><p>And a few pieces of jewelry, carefully preserved in velvet-lined boxes and fit for a Queen.</p><p>Family heirlooms. Dishes and trinkets that were worth more for their history than for whatever price they might fetch.</p><p>Then there was the box with the sealed message resting on top.</p><p>For the Queen.</p><p>You have found what we left behind to help when it will be needed most.</p><p>Give this box to the Grayhaven heir. Once it is placed in the heir\u2019s hands, all the spells that have kept these items safe will end, and this room can be found by any eye.</p><p>May the Darkness embrace you, Sister. You have given Dena Nehele, and my family, more than you know.</p><p>Lia</p><p>\u201cWhere in the name of Hell have you been?\u201d Theran said the moment Cassidy stepped out on the terrace, looking happy and incredibly dirty. \u201cGray\u2019s been frantic, worrying about you.\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire, was he relieved to see her! At that moment, he wanted to strangle her for scaring them all so much, but he was relieved to see her.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize it\u2019s midafternoon now and there\u2019s been no sign of you\u2014none!\u2014since the maid found the breakfast tray outside your door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo late?\u201d She looked startled. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>She shifted away from him. \u201cI was up in the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for? And why didn\u2019t you tell someone? We were ready to tear apart the town looking for you.\u201d Not to mention having to go to Sadi and tell him they had lost the Queen.</p><p>Vae joined them, so filthy he imagined the housekeeper was having a fit about the dog tramping through the house, and since he knew who would end up washing the little bitch, he wasn\u2019t quite as relieved to see her.</p><p>Especially when she growled at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d he snapped, pointing at Vae. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have told us where Cassidy had gone? You\u2019re always yapping about everything else.\u201d</p><p>*I do not yap.*</p><p>Theran snorted.</p><p>\u201cPrince . . . ,\u201d Cassidy began.</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to watch Gray running for the house. He watched Cassidy . . . and the way her eyes lit up when she saw Gray.</p><p>At least that answered one question.</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d Gray stopped at the edge of the terrace. \u201cThere\u2019s . . . there\u2019s something I want to show you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI have some things to show you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine first,\u201d Gray said.</p><p>Her smile widened. \u201cAll right.\u201d Then she looked at Theran and held out a rectangular wooden box, its top decorated with the Grayhaven seal. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As he took the box, his eyes asked the question.</p><p>\u201cI found the treasure,\u201d Cassidy said, her face glowing with excitement under the grime. \u201cIt\u2019s up there, Theran, along with so much of your heritage.\u201d She took a step toward Gray, then turned back. \u201cYou look like him, you know. Jared. You look like him.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, he watched as Gray clasped her hand and tugged her to the surprise in the garden. Talon had told him that a few times, but how would Cassidy know?</p> <p>\u201cGray, wait,\u201d Cassidy said. Too many emotions pouring off him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t tell if he was happy or upset, angry or excited.</p><p>Maybe all of them. Which meant her court would be equally upset by her unexpected absence.</p><p>Assuming any of them noticed or gave a damn.</p><p>You\u2019re tired, so you\u2019re bitchy, she scolded herself. \u201cGray, wait.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped, but he looked like he was about to receive a crippling blow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m parched. Can I have some water before I see the surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know it was a surprise?\u201d</p><p>Hell\u2019s fire. She wasn\u2019t supposed to know that. \u201cSince I don\u2019t know what you want to show me, it must be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>As he rubbed a thumb over her cheek, he made one of those lightning shifts from boy to man.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Gray, I\u2019m not hurt. I was up in the attic and lost track of time. I didn\u2019t mean to worry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared me, Cassie. That\u2019s a lot more than worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThere were too many years when someone going missing meant they weren\u2019t coming back. Captured or killed. Sometimes Talon found what was left of them. Most times not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gray.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again. \u201cDena Nehele isn\u2019t a safe place yet. It will be, someday, but for now it\u2019s still not safe to go off on your own and not leave a direction for someone to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d I\u2019ll miss you, Gray.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you some water.\u201d</p> <p>She drank her fill. Then Gray worked the pump for her so she could wash some of the grime off her face and hands.</p><p>He called in a small towel and handed it to her, and there was a question in his eyes that she couldn\u2019t figure out.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he said.</p><p>When she obeyed, he put an arm around her shoulders and guided her around the garden.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes now.\u201d</p><p>She looked at the flower bed and thought, Home. Then she looked more closely.</p><p>\u201cCommon ground,\u201d Gray said quietly. \u201cNot quite the same, but similar. Not quite home, but it could be home\u2014if you wanted to put down roots. And if you don\u2019t, if you can\u2019t, maybe I could put down roots in Dharo.\u201d</p><p>It was her mother\u2019s garden, and yet it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Then what he said sank in all the way.</p><p>\u201cDharo?\u201d she asked, finally looking away from the flowers. \u201cYou want to live in Dharo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you.\u201d He drew her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cTheran needs you,\u201d Cassidy said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I need you. I know it\u2019s not easy for you because your ways are so different from what we\u2019ve known here, but maybe we can find some common ground there too. Can\u2019t we try, Cassie? Can\u2019t we at least try?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her slowly, deeply, as if she truly mattered.</p><p>As if she were the only thing that mattered.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes. Not quite a man, but no longer a boy. She didn\u2019t know if they had a future together, but she did love him\u2014and wasn\u2019t love the most fertile ground of all?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to try, Gray,\u201d she said, her eyes filling with tears. \u201cI really would like to try.\u201d</p><p>His alarmed expression changed to thoughtful. \u201cAre those happy tears?\u201d</p><p>She hugged him hard. \u201cYes, these are happy tears.\u201d Then she stepped back, rubbed her face, and smiled. \u201cShow me the garden.\u201d</p><p>Theran watched Gray kiss Cassidy, but that quickly felt intrusive, so he turned away and opened the box.</p><p>\u201cTo the Heir of Grayhaven.\u201d</p><p>Under the wax-sealed paper was a Green Jewel that still held some of the psychic resonance of the woman who had worn it.</p><p>And some of the power,Theran realized as he felt that power fade, its last task completed.</p><p>The wax seal was so old, it crumbled when he tried to open it, but the words were clear enough.</p><p>To the Heir of Grayhaven,</p><p>If you are reading this, the treasure stands before you. Not the gold and jewels, although we hope those will help you rebuild what was destroyed, but the Queen who has the strength and heart to care for our land and our people. That is a treasure beyond price.</p><p>But you already know that. Something has happened that tested her commitment and her courage\u2014and you chose to stand with her. If you hadn\u2019t, the last key would have never been found, and Dena Nehele would fail within a decade, splintering until it was nothing more than a memory.</p><p>Now you have a chance to remember who we were as a people. You have a chance to be a strong land again.</p><p>The treasure stands before you. I hope you can cherish her as Jared cherished me.</p><p>May the Darkness embrace you.</p><p>Lia</p><p>\u201cTheran?\u201d</p><p>Talon stood inside the open terrace doors, out of the afternoon sunlight.</p><p>His throat was too tight for words, so Theran handed the letter to Talon and focused on Gray and Cassidy, who had their arms around each other\u2019s waists and were pointing at parts of the new flower bed Gray had planted for her.</p><p>\u201cMother Night,\u201d Talon said as he finished reading.</p><p>Theran opened the box.</p><p>\u201cLia\u2019s,\u201d Talon said, sounding hoarse. \u201cI recognize it. It was her Birthright Jewel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could see her the way he does,\u201d Theran said as he turned, again, to watch Gray and Cassidy. \u201cNot romantically. He loves her, and he deserves to be happy. But I wish I could see the Queen he sees when he looks at her. The Queen you see when you look at her. I didn\u2019t stand with her for her sake,Talon. I did it for Gray. I did it because it would destroy him if something happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still made the choice to stand with her. First time in a long time the Grayhaven line has defended a Queen. I guess that was enough.\u201d Talon folded the letter and gave it back. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Theran vanished the box and letter. \u201cI\u2019m going to learn how to be a good First Escort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Gray\u2019s sake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd for Dena Nehele. And for my own sake.\u201d</p><p>Ranon joined them, looked toward the garden, and grinned, his relief at seeing Cassidy evident on his face. \u201cLooks like Gray found her. That\u2019s good.\u201d Then the grin faded, and he looked wary. \u201cRemember the letter Cassidy wrote to the Shalador Queens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re here. And they would like to meet the Queen.\u201d</p><p>Theran probably looked as startled as Talon did. No one had expected the Shalador Queens to come out of hiding, much less leave the reserves.</p><p>He hesitated, automatically stalling for time until he could think of a reason why the other Queens couldn\u2019t meet with Cassidy.</p><p>As he looked at Talon and Ranon, he realized they expected him to make an excuse. Maybe it was time for him to stop feeling disappointed that he hadn\u2019t gotten what he\u2019d wanted from this bargain, because Dena Nehele had gotten what it needed\u2014a Queen who could help their land and all of its people.</p><p>It was time to be a First Escort.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he told Ranon.</p><p>Then he walked over to the new part of the garden, where Gray and Cassidy were still talking about the flowers they could see and the ones that were still just seeds in the dirt.</p><p>\u201cMy apologies for the interruption, Lady,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>Cassidy turned to look at him, her surprise at his formal address changing to wariness. \u201cIs something wrong, Prince?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe Shalador Queens are here and have requested an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came?\u201d</p><p>Her joy changed her plain face. It wasn\u2019t pretty, would never be pretty, but for a moment, he almost understood what men like Ranon and Talon saw when they looked at her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cThey came.\u201d He held out his right hand, palm down.</p><p>She placed her left hand over his, an automatic response. Then she stopped, said, \u201cOh,\u201d and looked at Gray.</p><p>And Theran saw Gray take another step toward becoming the man he should have been.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Gray said. \u201cRight now, Dena Nehele needs the Queen. The garden and I will be here when you\u2019re done with the day\u2019s business.\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t gone more than a couple of steps when Gray said, \u201cCassie? You might want to show them this flower bed. Some of the plants came from the reserves.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a smile at Gray over her shoulder, then lengthened her stride until she and Theran were almost running to the house. They bounded up the terrace steps.</p><p>\u201cMother Night!\u201d Cassidy skidded to a stop, looked down at herself, and gave him, Talon, and Ranon a look of undiluted female panic. \u201cI can\u2019t meet the Shalador Queens looking like this.\u201d</p><p>A week ago he would have thought her taking so long to remember her appearance was a sign that she didn\u2019t care how the people saw her. Now he understood it was a sign of how much the people mattered to her.</p><p>\u201cRanon and I can entertain the Ladies for a while and give you a chance to wash up,\u201d Theran said.</p><p>She flashed him a smile almost as brilliant as the one she\u2019d given Gray, then dashed into the house.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Theran said, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t keep the Ladies waiting.\u201d</p><p>But Ranon stepped outside, his expression a little dazed as he stared at the pots lining the terrace. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Theran looked. Then he smiled.</p><p>The honey pears were starting to grow. </p> </body></html>"]
