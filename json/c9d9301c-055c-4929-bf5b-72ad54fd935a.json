Who wouldn\u2019t feel that way? After seventeen years of what she\u2019d believed to be a reasonably good marriage, Zach\u2019s infidelity was the last thing she\u2019d expected.</p><p>He\u2019d never openly admitted to the affair. She hadn\u2019t found her husband in a compromising situation, hadn\u2019t found any concrete evidence\u2014no matchbooks from expensive restaurants, no jewelry receipts or motel bills\u2014but in her heart she knew. A wife always does.</p><p>Rosie owned up to the truth\u2014she was angry and she\u2019d expressed that anger by making this divorce as complicated and difficult as she possibly could. Why should she go easy on Zach or walk away from their marriage without one hell of a fight? And fight she had, with both fists raised.</p> <p>As she turned away from the judge, the final decree in her hand, she realized she\u2019d made another mistake.</p><p>Rosie had assumed that once the divorce was granted, the anger and bitterness of these dreadful months would be lifted. Wrong again. An even heavier burden had been added. When the joint custody agreement she and Zach had so carefully worked out, point by point, was presented to Judge Olivia Lockhart, the judge had rejected it.</p><p>Instead, Judge Lockhart had stated that it was emotionally detrimental to kids to shuffle them between residences every few days. Allison and Eddie needed stable lives, according to Judge Lockhart, and they hadn\u2019t asked for the divorce. Some people considered the judge innovative, Rosie thought, disgruntled. How about interfering? Or out of her mind? Because\u2014of all the crazy settlements\u2014she\u2019d awarded the children their house. That meant Rosie and Zach would be the ones moving in and out.</p><p>Talk about ridiculous! Talk about impossible.</p><p>Now that the divorce was final, Rosie and Zach would have to figure out some kind of living arrangements. The ramifications of what they\u2019d agreed to were starting to hit Rosie and she hadn\u2019t even left the courtroom.</p> <p>\u201cRosie,\u201d Sharon Castor, her attorney, said as soon as they were in the silent hallway outside the courtroom. \u201cWe have to meet with your ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>One look told Rosie that Sharon was as flustered as she was herself.</p><p>Otto Benson, Zach\u2019s lawyer, joined them. Although he remained outwardly calm, his face was tense. She dared not glance in Zach\u2019s direction. In fact, she\u2019d avoided looking at her ex-husband from the moment she\u2019d walked into the courtroom.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a conference room and discuss the details,\u201d Zach\u2019s attorney said.</p><p>Rosie peered at Zach, standing behind his lawyer. He didn\u2019t seem any happier than she was with this decision, but she\u2019d keel over in a dead faint before she let him know how she felt.</p><p>\u201cRosie and I should be able to work this out ourselves,\u201d Zach said with an edge of irritation.</p> <p>Given the way everything had gone so far, that suggestion wasn\u2019t promising. \u201cIf you remember, it took us weeks of haggling to come up with this joint custody agreement,\u201d she pointed out. She enjoyed reminding him what a jerk he\u2019d been. Rosie supposed Zach was hoping to avoid more attorneys\u2019 fees. Too bad. If he ended up with less money to spend on his girlfriend, that wasn\u2019t her concern.</p><p>Fists clenched, Zach snarled something under his breath. Probably just as well she couldn\u2019t hear it, Rosie decided, proud of her own display of self-control.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think we\u2019re capable of agreeing to anything without a mediator?\u201d she asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Zach muttered, with a pout reminiscent of their nine-year-old son. Staring at him now, Rosie had trouble believing she\u2019d ever loved Zachary Cox. Not only was he smug and argumentative and self-righteous, he had no idea what it meant to be a husband and father. Granted, Zach was a handsome man; not only that, his appearance proclaimed his success as a businessman, a professional. Although, in her opinion, anyone with half a brain would instantly peg him for an accountant. He had that narrowed look about his dark eyes, as if he spent too many hours a day squinting at columns of tiny numbers. Despite that, he was appealing to the eye with his broad shoulders\u2014which nicely set off his expensive suit\u2014and thick, dark hair. At one time he\u2019d been an athlete, and even now he routinely jogged and kept in shape.</p><p>Rosie had loved the firmness of his muscles as she stroked his back during lovemaking. Of course, it\u2019d been months since they\u2019d slept in the same bed, and much longer since they\u2019d actually made love.</p><p>Rosie didn\u2019t even remember the last time. Had she known, she might have appreciated it more, lingered a moment longer at her husband\u2019s side, savored the feel of his arms around her. One thing was certain: Zach hadn\u2019t been interested in her from the day he\u2019d hired Janice Lamond as his personal assistant.</p><p>The thought of him entwined with Janice nearly suffocated Rosie and she forcefully shoved the image from her mind. Anger and revulsion at her husband\u2019s\u2014no, ex-husband\u2019s\u2014unfaithfulness rose like bile in the back of her throat.</p><p>Zach\u2019s raised voice caught her attention; apparently he\u2019d agreed to have their attorneys negotiate this added complication to their divorce decree. Otto was checking with the clerk for an empty conference room.</p> <p>Once a private room in the law library was secured, Zach and his attorney sat at one side of the table, across from Rosie and hers.</p><p>Even the attorneys seemed perplexed by the situation. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever heard of such a decree before,\u201d Sharon said, starting the conversation.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d Otto frowned. \u201cThis is one for the books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Zach said in a curt voice, \u201cit\u2019s unusual, but we\u2019re both adults. We can figure this out. I know I was sincere about putting the children first.\u201d He glared at Rosie, as if to suggest she hadn\u2019t been.</p><p>\u201cIf you were sincere, you would\u2019ve had second thoughts about sleeping with that slut.\u201d Rosie hadn\u2019t intended to be argumentative, but if her ex-husband was so concerned about their children\u2019s welfare, he would never have broken his wedding vows.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to dignify that remark by responding to it,\u201d Zach said through gritted teeth. \u201cBesides if you were home more, instead of volunteering for every cause known to mankind, every cause except your children, you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I refuse to allow you to blame me for what you\u2019ve done.\u201d Her volunteer efforts were Zach\u2019s big complaint. He had his wish; she\u2019d had to resign from every position she held and seek paid employment. She hoped he was happy. For the first time since their children were born, Rosie wasn\u2019t a stay-at-home mom.</p><p>\u201cI thought we were here to discuss this divorce decree?\u201d Zach asked with a bored look, an expression that was obviously for her benefit. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to trade insults I\u2019d rather not pay our attorneys to listen.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right, Rosie mused, deriving a small sense of satisfaction out of knowing that Zach was responsible for both sets of attorneys\u2019 fees. He was the one with the high-paying job. She was currently taking summer classes to update her teaching certificate. Classes Zach was paying for. That was another notch in her belt\u2014another concession granted in their divorce settlement.</p><p>Her application was in with the SouthKitsapSchool District and, considering all her connections, she shouldn\u2019t have any difficulty getting hired as a substitute teacher in September.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make a list of what we can agree on,\u201d Sharon said briskly, ignoring the antagonism between Rosie and Zach. \u201cDespite the breakdown of your marriage, you both claim you want to keep the needs of your children first and foremost.\u201d</p><p>Rosie nodded and so did Zach.</p><p>Sharon smiled. She was a no-nonsense woman who wasn\u2019t swayed by emotion. \u201cOkay, that gives us a place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to compliment you both on your attitudes,\u201d Otto said, removing a legal pad from his briefcase as if to prove he was earning his pay. Zach had chosen the best and, for that matter, so had Rosie. Both attorneys came with high price tags.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Zach said sarcastically. \u201cIf we got along any better, we might\u2019ve stayed married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who to blame for that,\u201d Rosie snapped.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d he snapped right back. \u201cHow many nights were you actually home? How many dinners did you cook? If you don\u2019t remember, I do. Damn few.\u201d</p><p>Sharon sighed audibly. \u201cOkay, the kids come first, and at this point, they have the house, which means Rosie will need to find somewhere else to live for the three days a week when Zach\u2019s staying with them.\u201d</p><p>Somewhere else to live? Rosie\u2019s head jerked up as the shock ran up and down her spine. The reality\u2014the repercussions of the judge\u2019s edict\u2014had just started to sink in.</p><p>\u201cAnd pay half the mortgage on the house,\u201d Zach added, smiling at her benignly.</p><p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Rosie hadn\u2019t realized, hadn\u2019t thought that far in advance. \u201cI don\u2019t have a job yet\u2014how am I supposed to afford an apartment on top of everything else?\u201d This was grossly unfair. Surely Zach could see that such a demand was unreasonable. She had a life, too, and no way of building it if every penny she earned went into paying for two separate residences.</p><p>Rosie stared at Zach. He returned her look, unblinking.</p><p>\u201cI have a suggestion,\u201d Sharon said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d Zach\u2019s lawyer sounded eager, if not desperate, for ideas.</p><p>\u201cIf Zach spends three days a week at the house with the children, then his apartment will sit empty, is that right?\u201d She turned to Zach for verification.</p><p>Rosie studied him, too. In essence, Sharon was asking if Zach intended to move Janice into the apartment, Janice and her son, who was the same age as Eddie.</p><p>\u201cThe apartment will be empty,\u201d Zach said emphatically.</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d Sharon glanced from one to the other \u201c\u2014Rosie moves into the apartment during the time you\u2019re at the house? You did say it was a two-bedroom apartment, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Objections shot up like weeds in Rosie\u2019s fertile mind. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with Zach. She certainly didn\u2019t want to be put in a situation where she had to deal with being around him or his things\u2014or what had been their things. Nor did she want to be privy to any information regarding his relationship with his girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cNo way am I letting Rosie in my apartment.\u201d Apparently Zach shared her qualms. \u201cWe\u2019re divorced. It took months to get that way. Rosie wanted out and she got her wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were the one who moved out,\u201d she reminded him scornfully.</p><p>\u201cCorrection. You kicked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll recall, you insisted I see an attorney.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe how convenient his memory was.</p><p>Zach snorted and looked at Sharon. \u201cMore fool me.\u201d</p><p>Rosie\u2019s attorney raised both hands in a pleading gesture. \u201cListen, it\u2019s just a suggestion\u2014a way of saving money for you both.\u201d She turned to Rosie. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fortunate to find a place, even a studio apartment, for less than five, six hundred dollars a month.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cZach will have to pay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe divorce is final,\u201d Otto Benson stated. \u201cZach isn\u2019t responsible for anything more than what\u2019s already been agreed to.\u201d</p><p>Rosie\u2019s gaze flew to her attorney, and Sharon reluctantly nodded. All at once, this was more than Rosie could bear. Not only had she lost her husband, but now she was being forced out of her home, too. Moisture welled in her eyes, and she managed to blink it away. Hell would freeze over before she let Zach know what he was doing to her.</p> <p>A long moment passed before Zach finally spoke. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll agree to let Rosie stay in the apartment on the days I\u2019m at the house, as long as she\u2019s willing to split the rent.\u201d</p><p>Rosie was well aware that she had no choice, but she did have her pride and she was determined to hold on to that. \u201cOn one condition,\u201d she insisted, lifting her head.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Zach asked with a long-suffering sigh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you bringing that woman into the family home. I want our house to be a safe place for the children. In other words, I don\u2019t want Allison and Eddie exposed to your women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zach glared at her as though she\u2019d spoken a foreign language.</p> <p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d she said vehemently, meeting his angry eyes. \u201cThis divorce has been hard enough on the kids without you parading Janice or any other woman you decide to date through my home. I want the house off-limits to your...your floozies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFloozies?\u201d Zach smirked. \u201cFine, no floozies. And the same goes for you. I don\u2019t want you bringing any men to the house, either. No studs, no hotties, no boy toys, no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s rich,\u201d Rosie broke in, putting an end to his ridicule. In seventeen years she\u2019d never so much as looked at another man. Not since the day she\u2019d met Zach.</p><p>\u201cDo you or don\u2019t you agree?\u201d her ex-husband challenged.</p><p>\u201cOf course I agree!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>With their attorneys present, they made decisions about a number of other issues, and Sharon quickly wrote up an agreement. Zach\u2019s attorney reviewed it, and then both Zach and Rosie signed it.</p><p>By the time she left the courthouse, Rosie felt as if she\u2019d been pummeled by wave after wave in a stormy sea. Strange as it seemed, her heart actually ached. For weeks she\u2019d dreaded this day and at the same time longed for it, just so the divorce would finally be over. Now she wasn\u2019t sure what she felt, other than this deep pain that threatened to overpower her.</p><p>Nine-year-old Eddie was shooting baskets when Rosie pulled into the driveway at 311 Pelican Court</p><p>. In a little more than a month, school would start again. Perhaps then their lives would return to some semblance of routine.</p><p>Eddie caught the basketball and held it against his side as he waited for her to park the car in the garage. His sad dark eyes watched Rosie as he stepped aside so she could drive past.</p><p>Fifteen-year-old Allison was in the kitchen, microwaving a hot dog for lunch. She turned and stared at Rosie, eyes glittering defiantly. She resembled Zach so much just then.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Eddie asked, following Rosie into the kitchen. He continued to hold the basketball.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>The microwave beeped and Allison removed the steaming wiener, devoid of a bun. As if it had suddenly lost its appeal, she set the plate on the countertop and studied Rosie.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a...minor complication,\u201d Rosie announced. She didn\u2019t believe in hiding the truth from her children, especially when it involved something that would affect them.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of complication?\u201d Eddie asked, pulling out a kitchen chair. He balanced the basketball on the table, one hand supporting it. Allison crossed her arms and leaned against the counter, pretending to be bored; still, she didn\u2019t leave the room as she so often did.</p><p>With effort Rosie managed to show a bit of enthusiasm for Judge Lockhart\u2019s decree. \u201cWell...you guys won\u2019t be moving in and out of the house every few days, after all.\u201d</p><p>Allison and Eddie shared a look of surprise. Trying to sound positive, Rosie explained Judge Lockhart\u2019s decision and briefly outlined how the switch would work.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Dad\u2019s going to live here?\u201d Eddie asked as if he didn\u2019t quite understand. Rosie didn\u2019t blame him for being confused. She was, too. Confused and irritated by this turn of events. Add miserable to the mix, and it pretty much described the way she felt about life in general.</p><p>\u201cYour father will be at the house part-time,\u201d Rosie said, so there wouldn\u2019t be any misunderstanding. She\u2019d agreed to turn what had been her sewing room into a spare bedroom for his use. The sewing machine could go in the master bedroom without a problem.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Eddie said. He seemed disappointed, but then his eyes lit up as he realized he\u2019d have his father back, if only half the time. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Allison shouted. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, this entire divorce is bogus.\u201d With that she stormed out of the kitchen.</p><p>Rosie watched her daughter go, wishing she knew how to reach her. She wanted to put her arms around Allison and hug her and assure her that everything would be all right, but the girl wouldn\u2019t accept any kind of closeness. At least not from her...</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Allison,\u201d her nine-year-old said. \u201cShe\u2019s really glad about Dad coming home, even if it\u2019s only for a few days at a time, but she wouldn\u2019t let you know that for anything.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Sweat dripped down Grace Sherman\u2019s face, and the intense heat of the mid-July afternoon plastered her T-shirt to her skin. She dipped her roller in the tray and smoothly spread light-yellow paint across her bedroom wall. She was a librarian and, despite all the books she\u2019d taken out on home maintenance, she wasn\u2019t much good at renovations and repairs. Dan had always insisted on looking after the house. Alone at age fifty-five, Grace found that life continued to thrust her into unfamiliar and challenging situations.</p><p>\u201cI hope you appreciate what a good friend I am,\u201d Olivia Lockhart said from behind her. She, too, worked at covering the dingy white walls with yellow paint. Cautiously, Olivia\u2014her lifelong friend\u2014moved around the furniture pushed into the middle of the bedroom, protected by old sheets.</p><p>\u201cYou volunteered,\u201d Grace reminded her, using her forearm to wipe the perspiration from her brow. The room felt stifling and the air was still, even with the windows partially open.</p><p>After learning that her husband of thirty-four years, who\u2019d been missing since the previous April, was dead, Grace had developed insomnia. She didn\u2019t understand it. Olivia had suggested she repaint the room, thinking a different color might signify a new phase in her life. Pale yellow was a calm, optimistic color. Maybe her subconscious would get the hint. At the time it had sounded like a good idea, especially when her friend had offered to help. It was just the kind of thing Olivia would do. Over the years, they\u2019d supported each other through everything from minor domestic crises to life-shattering events.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I thought we could finish this in one day.\u201d Olivia groaned. Straightening, she planted her hands on the small of her back. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any idea how much work this was going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a glass of iced tea?\u201d Grace was more than ready for a break herself. The two of them had been painting for what seemed like forever but was probably only an hour or two. Still, they\u2019d had to move the furniture and do the prep work first\u2014laying a drop cloth on the floor and taping the windows.</p><p>Olivia set aside her roller. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to ask twice.\u201d</p><p>Grace wrapped both paint-coated rollers in a plastic bag, then headed into the kitchen. By the time Olivia finished washing her hands, Grace had poured the iced tea into tall glasses. Buttercup, her golden retriever, scratched at the screen door and Grace absently let her inside. Panting, the dog lumbered into the house and stretched out under the table, resting her chin on the cool tile floor.</p><p>Grace slumped into the chair and released the kerchief tied at the base of her neck, shaking her damp hair free. She wore it shorter these days, since she no longer needed to worry about her husband\u2019s likes and dislikes.</p><p>After witnessing Olivia\u2019s pain years before, Grace had never wanted to go through a divorce, but when Dan disappeared she wasn\u2019t left with any options. For financial reasons, it was the only practical choice.</p><p>That had been months ago now. Afterward, even learning Dan\u2019s fate was anticlimactic. She was relieved that his body had been discovered, but she\u2019d already endured the worst of the grief and guilt: the not knowing, the doubts, the recriminations\u2014all of which had befallen her after Dan\u2019s disappearance. So this sudden bout of insomnia didn\u2019t make sense to her.</p><p>\u201cThis was the best idea you\u2019ve had all day,\u201d Olivia said, sinking down on the chair. \u201cBesides putting on a Credence Clearwater Revival CD,\u201d she added. They\u2019d both gotten caught up in the music of their youth and hadn\u2019t realized how hot and uncomfortable they were until the last song on the CD ended.</p><p>\u201cWe may not have the moves we did thirty years ago, but we aren\u2019t ready for walkers just yet,\u201d Grace said, and Olivia agreed with an easy smile.</p><p>\u201cI heard about your latest decree,\u201d Grace said, smiling across the table at her friend. They\u2019d been working together all afternoon, but with the music playing they\u2019d barely had a chance to talk.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the joint custody case?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s all over town.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the first time Olivia had made a controversial decision in the courtroom.</p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes. \u201cAt least Jack didn\u2019t write about it in his column.\u201d</p><p>So Olivia was going to bring Jack Griffin into the conversation. Good. Grace had been looking for a way to introduce the subject. He and Olivia had been seeing each other for more than a year, and Grace loved Jack for the simple reason that he\u2019d made her friend happy. Once Olivia had started dating Jack, the local newspaper editor, she\u2019d been...more relaxed. More lighthearted. Then, a few weeks ago, Jack and Olivia had a falling out, a difference of opinion, really\u2014and they hadn\u2019t spoken since. Olivia was miserable, although she wasn\u2019t willing to admit it.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Jack,\u201d Grace asked brightly, \u201cwhat\u2019s new with the two of you?\u201d In her opinion Jack was exactly right for her friend. He was witty and funny and just outrageous enough to be interesting.</p><p>Olivia looked up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t. Tell me about Stan.\u201d</p><p>Stan was Olivia\u2019s ex-husband, who now lived in Seattle with his second wife, but he\u2019d been making regular appearances in Cedar Cove lately. Something must be up; however, Olivia had kept suspiciously quiet about it.</p><p>\u201cYou heard about Stan and Marge?\u201d Olivia asked, her eyes rounding with surprise. \u201cWho told you? Mom or Justine?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNeither one told me anything. I\u2019m waiting for you to enlighten me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia took a deep swallow of her iced tea, then glanced up, an uncertain expression on her face.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you,\u201d Grace pressed.</p><p>\u201cStan and Marge are getting a divorce.\u201d</p> <p>Shock waves went through Grace. This was news. Big news. No wonder Stan had been coming to Cedar Cove more frequently. His visits were often under the guise of seeing his daughter, Justine, and his grandson, who\u2019d been born a little more than two weeks ago. Grace found his sudden interest in family somewhat suspect. Especially since Stan had deserted his wife and children back in the summer of 1986. Jordan, a bright, lively thirteen-year-old, had gone swimming with friends one hot August afternoon and drowned. Justine, his twin sister, had held his lifeless body in her arms until the paramedics arrived. Everything in Olivia\u2019s life was marked by that day; it was the dividing point, the boundary between believing the world was a safe place and knowing it could be a treacherous one.</p><p>Olivia and Stan\u2019s marriage fell apart after Jordan drowned, but Grace had always wondered if Stan had been involved with Marge before Jordan\u2019s death. She\u2019d never said this to Olivia\u2019s face, but she had her suspicions.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t got anything to say?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Grace was almost surprised that Stan and Marge\u2019s marriage had lasted this many years. The ink on the divorce papers was hardly dry when Stan had married the other woman. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d she mumbled, which was slightly stretching the truth.</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Olivia said, looking melancholy and tired.</p> <p>Then it came to her. Grace should\u2019ve connected the dots much sooner. She felt like slapping her palm against her forehead in cartoon fashion. \u201cStan wants you back, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>For a moment it seemed as if Olivia wasn\u2019t going to answer, then she did with a nod of her head.</p><p>Outrage filled Grace. How dare he! How dare Stan walk back into Olivia\u2019s life after all these years and expect her to welcome him with open arms. Of all the nerve! His timing was impeccable, too, she thought wryly. Naturally Stan would reappear just when Olivia had met Jack. He must hate the idea of his ex-wife seeing anyone else.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell you about Stan for exactly this reason,\u201d Olivia muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re so angry your eyes are about to pop out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d Grace cried.</p><p>It occurred to her that Olivia might actually be considering a reconciliation with Stan. That was the worst thing she could do\u2014and if Olivia didn\u2019t know it, Grace wasn\u2019t too shy to tell her. Stan had never appreciated his wife. He\u2019d never seemed too concerned about what his leaving would do to her or to their remaining children. All Stan had ever cared about was himself and his needs, his wants.</p> <p>\u201cI know how you feel about Stan,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to him, are you? You wouldn\u2019t really consider it, would you?\u201d The thought was so repugnant Grace had difficulty getting the words out.</p><p>The perplexed uncertainty that came over Olivia was so unlike her that Grace had to make a conscious effort not to get up and hug her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Olivia whispered.</p><p>Grace merely nodded, arranging her features in as neutral an expression as possible.</p><p>\u201cThe day Leif was born,\u201d Olivia said, studying the inside of her glass as if it held the answers she needed, \u201cStan and I had the most wonderful time reminiscing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had three children with him,\u201d Grace said, trying to suppress her own negative view of the situation.</p><p>\u201cWe were happy for a lot of years.\u201d</p> <p>Grace couldn\u2019t deny that, but Stan had nearly crippled her friend emotionally. She above all others knew how long it had taken Olivia to recover her equilibrium following Jordan\u2019s death and the demise of her marriage.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jack?\u201d It was probably a mistake to introduce his name just then, but she was genuinely curious. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d Her guess was he did, and that was the key to their current troubles.</p><p>As Olivia nodded, her hand tightened around her glass. \u201cDo you want to know what he did?\u201d Her brown eyes sparked with irritation. \u201cI swear every time I think about it, I get mad.\u201d</p><p>This sounded promising.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t wait for an answer. \u201cJack gave me an ultimatum. He claimed Stan\u2019s been after me for months and that I had to choose\u2014either him or Stan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-es?\u201d Grace said, dragging out the word. \u201cAnd your point is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point,\u201d Olivia said with exaggerated patience, \u201cis that I\u2019m not some trophy to be won. Furthermore, I\u2019m not willing to play Jack\u2019s silly games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGames,\u201d Grace countered. \u201cIt seems to me you\u2019re the one playing games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Olivia cried.</p><p>\u201cYes, you,\u201d Grace said. \u201cDo you expect Jack to hang around and twiddle his thumbs while Stan waltzes back into your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I expect him to...to show some gumption. If I\u2019m as important to him as he says, then the least he can do is let me know how he feels.\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned. \u201cYou mean he hasn\u2019t told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold me?\u201d Olivia repeated. \u201cOh, hardly. He stopped by the house at an inopportune moment about a month ago. Stan had spent the night\u2014\u201d</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t disguise her shock. \u201cStan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot you, too,\u201d Olivia said, sounding utterly exasperated. \u201cIf you must know, he slept in James\u2019s old room upstairs. It was completely innocent. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019d think I\u2019d let him back in my bed....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d Grace said, eager to learn what had taken place. \u201cGo on, tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack and I were supposed to meet the next morning, but he showed up early with coffee and doughnuts, and there was Stan in my housecoat and fuzzy slippers. He looked ridiculous, but that\u2019s beside the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd naturally Jack assumed the worst.\u201d He\u2019d jumped to conclusions, just as Grace almost had.</p><p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Olivia echoed. \u201cI went after him and tried to explain, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. He said if I wanted to get back together with Stan, that was fine with him.\u201d</p><p>Grace frowned again. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what he said?\u201d</p><p>Olivia paused. \u201cMaybe not in so many words, but that was his message. I have to tell you it upset me that he actually thought I\u2019d sleep with Stan when the two of us had been seriously dating.\u201d</p><p>A picture was beginning to take shape in Grace\u2019s mind. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from him since, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Mom thinks I should phone him.\u201d Slowly Olivia raised her eyes to meet Grace\u2019s. \u201cIs that what you think, too?\u201d</p><p>Grace shrugged. If she was the one in this situation, she might, but then...</p><p>\u201cThe thing is,\u201d Olivia said, biting her lower lip, \u201cI want Jack to show some commitment here. Proof that he cares. If he honestly loves me, I think he should fight for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFight for you?\u201d The image that came to Grace\u2019s mind, of Jack and Stan standing in the driveway, dukes raised, was comical. \u201cYou mean you want him to challenge Stan to a fistfight? Or\u2014\u201d she grinned, imagining them in Regency-era costumes, brandishing pistols \u201c\u2014a duel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Olivia said impatiently. \u201cI want him to give me some indication, a sign that I\u2019m worth more to him than his stupid male pride. That\u2019s all.\u201d She lowered her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s acting like a hurt little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine he is hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, so am I. He instantly decided I\u2019d spent the night with Stan, although we\u2019d been seeing each other exclusively. If he really believes I\u2019m that kind of woman, I\u2019m better off without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up on him so quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a month, Grace.\u201d Slowly, sadly, she shook her head. \u201cWhat else am I supposed to think? He\u2019s apparently content just to drop the relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Grace asked. \u201cAre you willing to walk away from Jack?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer immediately. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>This was encouraging. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she readily admitted. \u201cGive it time, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. She drained her tea, stood and set her glass in the sink. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Olivia said, stopping her. She was still seated. \u201cWhile we\u2019re on the subject of men, tell me what\u2019s happening between you and that good-looking rancher.\u201d</p><p>Grace wanted to groan out loud. She\u2019d really prefer not to discuss Cliff Harding. They\u2019d been seeing each other for nearly a year; they\u2019d met shortly after Grace had filed for divorce. She hadn\u2019t officially gone out with him until her divorce was final, but he\u2019d let her know he was interested. Grace was interested in him, too; however, for some reason, their mutual attraction made her uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a decent, wonderful man comes into your life and you can\u2019t figure it out?\u201d</p><p>Grace ignored the light sarcasm. \u201cDan and I got married so young,\u201d she said, and because it was apparent that Olivia wasn\u2019t going to let her escape, she reclaimed her seat. \u201cWe were just teenagers, and then Dan went off to Vietnam. But despite all that, despite the difficulties we had, I never looked at another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Olivia said, her voice low and soothing.</p><p>\u201cGiven the least bit of encouragement, Cliff would ask me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was so kind the day of Dan\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>Grace could only agree. Cliff had showed up at the house following the wake and tenderly looked after her. She\u2019d been exhausted, mentally, physically, emotionally. That afternoon, Cliff had comforted her, tucked her into bed and made her dinner. Grace had never met anyone as thoughtful as Cliff Harding, and, frankly, the way that made her feel frightened her.</p><p>\u201cI know Cliff wants us to be serious,\u201d she said, her voice trembling, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t dated anyone except him since Dan disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think seeing a man exclusively\u2014any man\u2014is the same trap you fell into during high school?\u201d Olivia asked. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to be divorced or a widow, but I\u2019m both. I guess I don\u2019t want to limit myself to one person at this stage. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to be in a relationship.\u201d There, she\u2019d said it, and as soon as the words were out she understood what had been happening and why.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d Olivia was studying her closely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d she breathed. The insomnia, the anxiety, it all made sense to her now. She didn\u2019t need her bedroom repainted to help release her from the memories of her dead husband. Yes, she had concerns about some information Dan had given her in the letter he\u2019d written just before his death, information to think about, but Dan had very little to do with what had been churning inside her these last few weeks. All this angst was tied to her relationship with Cliff. What she needed was time and space and freedom to discover who she was\u2014who she\u2019d become\u2014and what she wanted out of life. She needed a chance to be herself, by herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore Cliff,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI truly do, but I\u2019m not ready to be as serious as he is. Not yet...I just can\u2019t.\u201d Although she was almost in tears, Grace experienced an incredible feeling of relief, and for the first time since Dan\u2019s funeral, she knew she\u2019d sleep through the night.</p><p>\u201cYou have to tell Cliff,\u201d Olivia said urgently.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She had to find a way to explain without offending him or losing his friendship. \u201cI\u2019d like to continue seeing him, but I want the freedom to see other men, too.\u201d Said out loud, it seemed so unfair and selfish, but it was the truth and that was something Grace often had a difficult time admitting, especially to herself.</p> <p>Three</p><p>As the morning light cascaded into her bedroom, Maryellen Sherman rolled carefully onto her back, astounded at the determined effort it took to shift her \u201cnine-months-and-counting\u201d pregnant body.</p><p>Her sister had warned her there\u2019d be days she\u2019d feel as big as the Goodyear blimp, and there were, but Maryellen couldn\u2019t remember a time she\u2019d been happier.</p><p>\u201cAny day now,\u201d she said, rubbing her hand over her tight, round abdomen. Catherine \u201cKatie\u201d Grace kicked and stretched, and Maryellen marveled as she watched her stomach extend and move. Glancing at the clock, she saw it was eight-thirty, time to get up. She struggled to sit, and with her palms braced against one side of the bed, Maryellen stared down at her feet and realized they were no longer visible. In fact, it\u2019d been weeks since she\u2019d last seen her toes.</p><p>She stood awkwardly and supported her back with both hands. It\u2019d begun to ache, which was no surprise. That was what she got for sleeping on a worn-out old mattress. Once she started moving around, she\u2019d feel better. On bare feet, she padded into the kitchen and put on water to make herself a pot of herbal tea; while she waited for it to boil, she sorted through the four maternity tops that were still decent enough to wear outside the house.</p> <p>This pregnancy hadn\u2019t been planned, and she\u2019d tried to hide the fact that she was pregnant from the father\u2014not a smart move on her part but a desperate one. Jon Bowman, an artist whose work had been displayed at the gallery she managed, had learned about the baby on his own. He\u2019d been adamant about having a role in his daughter\u2019s life. Maryellen didn\u2019t like it, but she didn\u2019t have any choice. It was either grant Jon visitation rights or fight him in court, something she\u2019d rather avoid.</p><p>Maryellen was fond of him and respected his considerable talent. What she disliked most about Jon wasn\u2019t his fault at all. With barely any effort, he\u2019d managed to awaken her sensual nature. Until that November night last year, she\u2019d assumed the sexual part of herself had been buried for good, along with her failed marriage. Jon had deftly proved otherwise.</p><p>The biggest regret in her life had come when she was a college student. Maryellen had experienced another unplanned pregnancy. She\u2019d allowed her boyfriend, soon-to-be-husband, to manipulate her, and at his insistence had aborted her baby. She hadn\u2019t wanted to, and she\u2019d never been able to forgive herself for doing it.</p><p>This time around, she was determined to protect her unborn child. This time she refused to listen to anyone or anything other than her own heart. She wanted this child, loved this child. What had begun as a terrifying mistake had become a valued second chance.</p><p>It had been a shock to find out that Jon intended to be part of Katie\u2019s life. So much so, he\u2019d threatened to take Maryellen to court if she excluded him from seeing his daughter. Maryellen had no grounds on which to keep him away, so she\u2019d reluctantly agreed to his terms.</p><p>The kettle whistled as she finished laying out her clothes. Massaging her back with one hand, Maryellen poured the boiling water into the waiting teapot. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea how happy I\u2019m going to be to drink coffee again,\u201d she muttered to her unborn daughter.</p> <p>Maryellen showered and dressed, and because she was only working half days, she had a leisurely breakfast of toast and yogurt and tea. She didn\u2019t need to be at the HarborStreetArtGallery until shortly before noon. She loved her job, and enjoyed the friendships she had with many of the local artists. Jon was a photographer, and his work, mostly nature photography, was both breathtaking and insightful. After she\u2019d rejected him, he\u2019d decided to take his photographs elsewhere. At the time, his decision had seemed for the best, but the truth of it was, she missed seeing him and the gallery certainly missed the revenue his work had provided.</p><p>Jon\u2019s talent was what had first attracted her, but she found the man himself intriguing. He was unpretentious and straightforward\u2014and reticent about the details of his own life. Although she\u2019d worked with him for more than three years, she knew nothing about his artistic training and next to nothing about his personal background. The one bit of information he\u2019d given her was that he\u2019d inherited a stunning piece of property from his grandfather, the property on which he\u2019d built his house. When she asked him questions, he either walked away or changed the subject. For the most part, he declined invitations to social gatherings. She\u2019d been surprised when he\u2019d agreed to attend a Halloween party last year. She\u2019d made up an excuse to invite him, never believing he\u2019d actually show up. That night they\u2019d shared their first kiss, which was the beginning of it all. In the days that followed, Maryellen had come to know him as well as anyone in Cedar Cove, and probably better. The baby kicked and she smiled to herself. Obviously she did know him better than most.</p><p>Still, she was impressed by the man who\u2019d fathered her child. Jon had constructed his own home and worked as a chef for The Lighthouse restaurant, all while his reputation as a photographer grew in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you until noon,\u201d Lois Habbersmith said when Maryellen walked into the gallery at eleven-thirty, a little ahead of schedule.</p><p>Until recently, Lois had been Maryellen\u2019s assistant, but had been temporarily promoted to gallery manager during Maryellen\u2019s maternity leave. She was confident Lois would do a more-than-adequate job.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your next doctor\u2019s appointment?\u201d Lois asked.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning.\u201d The ache in her back seemed to be getting worse. Maryellen pulled out a chair and sat down.</p><p>Lois looked concerned. \u201cAre you feeling all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Maryellen admitted. \u201cThe truth is, I\u2019m having this weird backache.\u201d She realized the ache seemed to diminish and then increase fairly regularly. It suddenly occurred to her that perhaps this wasn\u2019t a backache, but the onset of labor.</p><p>As if she, too, had reached the same conclusion, Lois walked all the way around her. \u201cMy labor pains always started in my back.\u201d Then holding one finger to her lips, Lois said, \u201cMaryellen, you think you could be going into labor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...I should probably time these...pains, shouldn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Lois clapped her hands excitedly. \u201cThis is so wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLois, Lois, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in labor. I just have this...strange feeling.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen glanced at her watch and tried to remember when she\u2019d last felt this odd pain that seemed to radiate from her spine.</p><p>\u201cYour mom\u2019s your birth partner, right?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded. She vaguely remembered that her mother had mentioned she\u2019d be attending a librarians\u2019 meeting in Seattle on Wednesday. Today was Wednesday. Grace had a cell phone, Maryellen knew, but she was constantly forgetting to turn it on, or off, in which case the battery would run low. No need to contact her mother just yet, she decided. There was plenty of time, and she wasn\u2019t convinced she was officially in labor, anyway. She wondered if maybe this was false labor, which several people had warned her about.</p><p>A few hours later, at home by herself, Maryellen was no longer wondering. She knew. There was nothing false about this. What had started out as a dull ache in her back had ultimately worked its way around, and she was having contractions at five-minute intervals. She reached for the phone and dialed her mother.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d suspected, her mother\u2019s cell phone was off or not working or the battery was dead. Or whatever! Drawing in a deep breath, Maryellen closed her eyes. There was always her sister. Kelly had been wonderful ever since she\u2019d learned Maryellen was pregnant. They\u2019d grown closer than at any time since they were teenagers.</p><p>After five rings, Kelly and Paul\u2019s answering machine came on. Hoping she sounded collected and in control, Maryellen left a message. \u201cKelly, hi. Listen, it looks like I\u2019m going into labor. I haven\u2019t called Dr. Abner yet and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s loads of time, but I thought you should know.\u201d Then, not wanting her sister to guess how panicky she was beginning to feel, Maryellen added, \u201cMom won\u2019t be back from that librarians\u2019 meeting until this afternoon, so when you\u2019re available maybe you could give me a call. I...I don\u2019t have anyone to drive me to the hospital.\u201d Any pretense of composure vanished by the time she replaced the receiver in its cradle.</p><p>As Maryellen turned away from the phone, she felt a pain so sharp it nearly doubled her over. Almost immediately water gushed from between her legs. Amniotic fluid.</p><p>Maryellen stood in a puddle of water and tried to think clearly. Fearing any movement might endanger her child, she stretched out one hand for the phone, then hesitated, not knowing whom to call.</p><p>Suddenly it became obvious. She had to get the number from directory assistance. As she punched it out, she prayed Jon was home and close to a phone.</p><p>When there was no answer at his house, she nearly wept with frustration. Panic started to set in; warding it off, she forced herself to remain calm. On the off chance that he was working, she dialed The Lighthouse restaurant.</p><p>The woman who answered was polite and friendly. Maryellen was put on hold. After an eternity, Jon came on the line, and his clipped greeting said he wasn\u2019t happy to be called away from whatever he was doing.</p><p>Frightened, near desperate, Maryellen whispered hoarsely, \u201cJon...I need help\u2014\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t allowed to finish. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome. My water broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her relief was overwhelming. She blinked rapidly to keep from breaking into grateful tears. \u201cThank you,\u201d she began, but the line had already gone dead.</p><p>Only a few minutes later she heard a car door slam outside her small rental house. By then, she\u2019d called Dr. Abner and learned that her instincts had been right; he wanted her to go directly to the hospital\u2019s birthing center.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t bother to knock but came barreling in the front door. He had on his white chef\u2019s shirt and pants, both of which were stained. Obviously she\u2019d caught him in the middle of the midday rush. She hadn\u2019t seen him in weeks. The last time had been early in the summer when they\u2019d agreed to visitation, and despite the frantic way his gaze darted to her now, he looked wonderful. By conventional standards Jon wasn\u2019t a handsome man. His features were too sharp, his face long and narrow, his nose almost hawk-like, but Maryellen had learned a harsh lesson when it came to attractive men. At first glance, Jon wasn\u2019t going to cause hearts to flutter; it was only on closer examination that she\u2019d recognized the strength of character she found so compelling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said weakly, staring down at the floor and the watery mess she was standing in.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve got yourself in a little predicament here.\u201d His smile warmed her.</p><p>\u201cWere you serious about wanting to see Katie\u2019s birth?\u201d she asked. The panic was completely gone now that he was here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that if it\u2019s possible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve just been nominated to drive me to the hospital\u2019s birthing center.\u201d</p><p>In three quick strides he was across the room and scooped her into his arms as if her considerable weight was of little consequence.</p><p>She wanted to protest, to suggest she was too heavy for him, but she didn\u2019t. For the first time since she\u2019d tried to reach her mother, Maryellen felt protected. Safe. He helped her change clothes and then carried her out the door.</p><p>He carefully placed her inside his vehicle. \u201cIs your suitcase packed?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll except my toothbrush.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab that and your overnight bag and be right back.\u201d</p><p>He left her and returned just as she was having a contraction. They\u2019d gotten much stronger in the minutes since her water broke. Closing her eyes, she tilted her head back and exhaled, trying to remember everything she\u2019d learned in her birthing class.</p><p>Jon was in the driver\u2019s seat beside her when she opened her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He\u2019d gone pale, she noticed. She attempted to reassure him with a smile.</p><p>Later, Maryellen remembered almost nothing about the ride from Cedar Cove into Silverdale and the birthing center. Jon didn\u2019t speak, and she didn\u2019t, either, concentrating on the breathing techniques she\u2019d learned while he drove, expertly weaving through traffic.</p> <p>When they arrived at the center, there seemed to be all kinds of activity going on around her. She was stripped, prepped, helped into bed and had a fetal monitor attached. Jon disappeared, and she wondered if he\u2019d dropped her off and then left again. She supposed that made sense, since she\u2019d clearly called him in the middle of his shift.</p><p>Then she was alone in a comfortable room with every modern device to distract her from the pain. There was soft music and a television with VCR should she care to watch, but none of that interested her.</p><p>The contractions were far more intense than anyone could have warned her. She mentally counted the seconds as each contraction came over her, working its way from her back to her front, tightening her belly.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen?\u201d Jon\u2019s voice was low.</p><p>Her eyes flew open and she found him standing in the doorway. Her relief and gratitude were instantaneous. Propping herself up on one elbow, she asked hopefully, \u201cCan you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>She did. Until that moment, she hadn\u2019t realized how much she wanted him with her, how much she needed him. Not just anyone. Him.</p><p>Coming all the way into the room, he sat on the chair by her side and studied the monitor as it recorded her labor. Although he hadn\u2019t attended a single birthing class, he seemed to know exactly what to say and do to comfort her. When she moved onto her side, he rubbed her back and whispered reassurances. His voice was encouraging as he repeatedly told her what a good job she was doing.</p> <p>The length and intensity of the contractions continued, and in the middle of one that lasted almost a minute\u2014the longest minute of her life\u2014the pain overwhelmed her. She whimpered softly.</p><p>\u201cDo something!\u201d Jon demanded of the nurse who happened to step into the room just then. \u201cShe can\u2019t take this pain.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled benevolently. \u201cMaryellen has opted for a natural birth. We\u2019re simply respecting her wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Maryellen said, but she wondered how long she could hold out. \u201cWould it be all right if I held your hand?\u201d</p><p>Jon was on his feet and leaning toward her. He braced his elbow against the bed and offered her his hand. From that moment on, she clung to him. When it was time to bear down, Jon was with her, his head close to her own, his arm around her shoulders. Dr. Abner arrived, and that assured her it wouldn\u2019t be much longer.</p><p>Jon introduced himself and then in a low, soothing voice, continued to offer Maryellen encouragement and support. Leaning against him, she strained, pushing this child from her body and panting wildly between pains.</p><p>With the next contraction she gripped Jon\u2019s hand and pushed, groaning with the effort. Sweat poured off her. Then all at once, her daughter slipped free. Maryellen gasped as she heard Catherine Grace\u2019s fragile cry.</p><p>Pride and love filled Maryellen and her eyes brimmed with tears. She smiled tremulously at Jon and was surprised to see that he, too, had tears rolling down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWelcome, Katie,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Jon looked at her. \u201cKatie, not Catherine?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded. She\u2019d gotten in the habit of calling her daughter that. \u201cCatherine seems a bit of a mouthful for such a tiny baby, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Katie was his mother\u2019s name, too, and Maryellen wanted to do that for him\u2014to honor the mother he\u2019d obviously loved.</p><p>Jon studied their child\u2019s red face, contorted by angry cries. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered, and his arm tightened around her shoulders. Dr. Abner handed their wailing daughter to the nurse.</p><p>\u201cYou can come with me, Dad,\u201d the delivery nurse told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to weigh and wash her up, and then you can hold your little girl.\u201d</p><p>Jon seemed to be seeking her approval. With tears of joy and jubilation, Maryellen nodded. Nothing in the world could compare to this feeling. This wonderful sense of triumph, of joy, of love. Because Maryellen already knew that she loved her baby. The power of that love settled over her heart unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>Jon and the nurse were busy on the other side of the room. Maryellen couldn\u2019t see everything that was happening, but she saw Jon\u2019s face when the woman settled Katie in his arms. His look was one of such awe and elation, she felt profoundly moved. At just that moment, he glanced up and their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he mouthed, cradling her protectively in the crook of his arm.</p><p>Wanting to hold her, Maryellen stretched out her arms and Jon crossed the room and placed Katie in her waiting embrace.</p><p>This was the way it would be with them, Maryellen realized. They\u2019d have to learn to share their daughter. To work together. To put their own wants and needs aside\u2014to put Katie\u2019s first.</p><p>There was a knock at the door, which Maryellen ignored. Instead, she studied Catherine Grace. Her tiny face was still red and her eyes were squeezed tightly shut, as if the lights were too strong for her.</p><p>Jon offered her his finger and Katie\u2019s tiny hand wrapped around it.</p><p>A young woman, apparently a volunteer, stuck her head into the room. \u201cA Mrs. Sherman is outside. She says she\u2019s supposed to be your birthing partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my mother,\u201d Maryellen explained, smiling.</p><p>The volunteer smiled back. \u201cI\u2019ll send her in.\u201d</p><p>A couple of minutes later, both her mother and Kelly were in the room. Maryellen was bombarded with questions. Before she was even aware of it, Jon had disappeared. She hadn\u2019t had a chance to thank him.</p><p>While she waited for the city council meeting to start, Charlotte Jefferson dug out her knitting. It distressed her that more people in the community didn\u2019t concern themselves with local government. But then, this was only her second meeting in seventy-five years. Until recently, she hadn\u2019t paid much attention to civic affairs herself.</p><p>\u201cHello, Louie,\u201d she said, nodding politely when the mayor walked in. She sat alone in the front row.</p><p>\u201cI understand congratulations are in order,\u201d Louie Benson said as he strolled past her. The Bensons were an old Cedar Cove family. Louie\u2019s younger brother, Otto, was a prominent attorney in town.</p><p>\u201cYes, I have a great-grandson,\u201d she confirmed. \u201cMy first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand Grace Sherman\u2019s a grandmother now\u2014for the second time, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust last week.\u201d Grace was as proud of her first granddaughter, Maryellen\u2019s baby, as she was of her grandson, Kelly and Paul\u2019s little Tyler. Charlotte thought it had worked out nicely that her daughter, Olivia, and Olivia\u2019s best friend could be grandmothers together. Those two had always been close and a blessing to each other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unusual to see you at the council meetings,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cNot that it isn\u2019t a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for a reason.\u201d Charlotte jerked fiercely on her yarn as she continued knitting.</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do?\u201d the mayor had the good sense to inquire.</p><p>Frankly Charlotte had hoped he\u2019d ask. \u201cI want to propose that this town open a health clinic. I think it\u2019s shameful that we haven\u2019t had one before now.\u201d At a minimum, people had to drive ten or fifteen miles to the Bremerton area for medical attention, and it often meant waiting hours in the emergency room. A town the size of Cedar Cove could easily support a clinic. But Charlotte wanted a particular kind of health facility, a place for everyone in Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cNow, Charlotte\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne that\u2019ll take patients on a sliding fee scale,\u201d she added, unwilling to listen to Louie\u2019s objections. \u201cI know Medicare and Medicaid patients would welcome the opportunity to avoid having to go all the way into Bremerton or Silverdale for their health needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many of my friends are reluctant to see a physician for fear of what it\u2019ll cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I realize that, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLouis Benson, you\u2019re talking like a politician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Charlotte, you and I both know this is strictly a figurehead position. The town\u2019s run by a hired manager. If you want to talk to Matthew Harper about setting up a low-cost health clinic, then go ahead, but I can tell you right now there\u2019s no budget for it.\u201d</p><p>Fine, if that was what it took, she\u2019d discuss this with the manager. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>The mayor looked slightly uncomfortable and glanced over his shoulder. When he spoke again, he lowered his voice. \u201cA bit of advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything you can tell me would be welcome,\u201d she assured him, staring down at her knitting as if it demanded her full concentration.</p><p>\u201cGet all your facts together before you see Matt Harper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she assured him. Harper was reputed to be a tough bargainer, scrupulous about town budgets, but he\u2019d met his match if he thought he could roadblock her efforts. If it was the last thing she did before she died, Charlotte fully intended to see that Cedar Cove got a health facility of its own.</p><p>The door opened, and the mayor quickly straightened. \u201cHow\u2019s everyone at the SeniorCenter doing?\u201d he asked, as if making polite conversation.</p><p>\u201cLaura\u2019s rheumatism is acting up,\u201d Charlotte informed him. \u201cShe says it\u2019s going to be a hard winter. Bess has had a cough all summer. I keep telling her she should see a doctor, but she\u2019s afraid of what he might tell her so she refuses to go. If there was a clinic here in town, I\u2019d make the appointment and drag her in myself. And Evelyn...\u201d Charlotte paused when she realized Louie was no longer listening. His attention was focused elsewhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he noticed she\u2019d stopped talking, he patted her shoulder and said, \u201cGood to chat with you, Charlotte. I\u2019ll see what we can do about your suggestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that,\u201d she said, but she already knew her words had gone in one ear and out the other. Louie Benson had given her a bit of helpful advice, however. She needed facts and figures.</p><p>Charlotte decided to leave as soon as she finished this purl row. No one wanted to listen to a cranky old woman. Least of all this roomful of men, each one struggling to appear more important than the next. The door at the back of the room creaked open, and assuming it was another councillor, Charlotte didn\u2019t turn to look.</p><p>To her surprise, it was Ben Rhodes. He was a tall, distinguished man with a thick head of white hair. She might be seventy-five, but Charlotte had never been immune to a handsome man...and still wasn\u2019t. Some of the ladies at the SeniorCenter thought of Ben as a Cesar Romero look-alike. He\u2019d recently moved to the area and she didn\u2019t know him well, but he was a popular figure at the center\u2014for obvious reasons.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Ben,\u201d she said when he took a seat across the aisle from her.</p><p>He glanced in her direction; she could tell from the blank look in his eyes that he didn\u2019t recognize her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Charlotte Jefferson from the HenryM.JacksonSeniorCenter.\u201d</p><p>A warm smile transformed Ben\u2019s face as he crossed the aisle and sat one chair away from her. They hadn\u2019t been formally introduced, but she\u2019d seen him a number of times. Ben was at the SeniorCenter every Monday, the same as she, only he played bridge and pinochle and she was part of the ladies\u2019 knitting group.</p><p>Ben always came alone and she\u2019d wondered about his wife, but they\u2019d never had an opportunity to talk. From the way the ladies fluttered around him like bees over a glass of lemonade, she guessed he was a widower.</p> <p>She\u2019d made a point of saying hello to him the afternoon Olivia was guest of honor at the once-a-month luncheons the center put on. But she\u2019d spoken to so many people that day. It\u2019d been glorious having her own daughter give such an impressive speech. Still, that was months ago now, and Charlotte wasn\u2019t sure Ben even remembered that Olivia was her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were interested in politics,\u201d Charlotte said, starting a fresh row despite her earlier decision to leave. There was no need to rush now that Ben was here.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t much care for political discussion, but I wanted to make a suggestion to the council. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here for the same reason,\u201d she declared. \u201cCedar Cove needs a health clinic.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s deep blue eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA health clinic with a sliding fee scale,\u201d Charlotte said, \u201cso it\u2019s affordable to everyone, no matter what age or income.\u201d</p> <p>Ben nodded fervently. \u201cI couldn\u2019t agree with you more.\u201d</p><p>They sat through the meeting with one empty chair between them. When Matthew Harper asked if there was any new business, Ben stood, resting his hands on the back of the chair in front of him.</p><p>\u201cIf I might address the council,\u201d he said.</p><p>Harper raised his head, glanced curiously at the two of them, and nodded.</p><p>Ben spoke eloquently. He talked about people\u2019s right to quality health care and the advantages a clinic would bring to Cedar Cove. He finished with the statement, \u201cLet\u2019s work together to overcome the bureaucratic issues and get the approvals we need. If we can do that, we\u2019ll have done what\u2019s necessary to improve the health of everyone in our community.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte felt like leaping to her feet and applauding. He\u2019d spoken far more convincingly than she could have and without emotion. Ben somehow made it sound as though a clinic was eminently possible thanks to the council\u2019s leadership and influence. Charlotte marveled at his finesse.</p><p>The council, all smiles, promised to look into the matter and report back at the next meeting.</p><p>Then the meeting was dismissed, and Charlotte tucked her knitting inside her bag. \u201cYou were wonderful,\u201d she told Ben. \u201cI could never have presented the case for a health clinic nearly as well as you did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d He stood and politely stepped aside, letting her exit the row ahead of him.</p><p>They walked out into the warm air. It was Thursday evening and music could be heard coming from the waterfront park. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know I skipped tonight\u2019s Concert on the Cove for this,\u201d she said, although it was no real sacrifice this evening. The organizers had hired puppeteers and the program was geared more toward youngsters.</p><p>\u201cHow about a cup of coffee?\u201d Ben offered.</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s heart fluttered wildly. This was silly, but it wasn\u2019t every night she got such an attractive invitation. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we go down to The Lighthouse?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>Charlotte beamed. \u201cThat would be perfect. My granddaughter and her husband just opened it, you know.\u201d</p><p>Ben looked suitably impressed. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a good job.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte agreed, but it wouldn\u2019t seem right if she bragged on and on about Justine and Seth. She was thrilled at how well the couple was doing, considering how little practical experience they had with restaurants. What they did have was a wonderful chef, good people skills and genuine business ability.</p><p>As it happened, both Seth and Justine were off for the night, which was just as well, Charlotte mused, as she sat out on the patio with a lovely view of the cove. The revolving beam from the lighthouse could be seen intermittently in the distance, and the lights from the shipyard shimmered over the dark surface of SinclairInlet.</p><p>They both ordered coffee and apple pie with ice cream.</p><p>\u201cWhat a nice suggestion,\u201d Charlotte said, slicing her fork into her warm pie. It was spicy with cinnamon and went perfectly with the rich vanilla taste of the ice cream. Dessert was an indulgence, but life was too short to do without the occasional treat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ve been times I wanted to stop by here, but it isn\u2019t any fun eating by myself,\u201d Ben confessed. Shaking his head sadly, he told her, \u201cMy wife died six years ago. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get accustomed to being alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Clyde\u2019s been gone sixteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte did understand. Even after all these years, she still felt the dull ache of a deep but long-ago grief. Clyde was her everything: her faithful friend, constant companion, her husband and lover. The empty space his death had left in her life could never be filled.</p><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019re retired navy,\u201d she said, changing the subject before they became too melancholy.</p><p>\u201cForty years,\u201d Ben confirmed. \u201cI enlisted shortly after World War II, when I was eighteen, served in Korea and Vietnam. Retired as a colonel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo boys. They\u2019re both married and have families of their own. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met Olivia, I believe.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThe judge.\u201d</p><p>So he did remember. \u201cI have a son, too. Will. He lives near Atlanta, Georgia. He\u2019s a nuclear engineer,\u201d she boasted.</p><p>\u201cSteven, my oldest boy, lives in Georgia, too. Ever hear of St.SimonsIsland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClyde and I visited there one summer. Let me think\u2014it must\u2019ve been back in the sixties, but I still remember how lovely it was. All those giant live oaks dripping with Spanish moss.\u201d</p><p>Ben smiled. \u201cJoan used to love visiting the island.\u201d At the mention of his wife\u2019s name, his eyes grew sad. Because Charlotte understood how devastating it was to lose one\u2019s life mate, she gently patted his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt does hurt less after a while,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLife is never the same, but gradually we adjust. Every year\u2019s a little easier.\u201d Perhaps it would help if he talked, she thought. \u201cTell me about her.\u201d</p><p>Ben looked surprised. \u201cYou want me to talk about Joan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019d like to.\u201d</p><p>He did; that was soon apparent. \u201cJoan went with me all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI was stationed in Europe and Asia and in a number of states. Never once did she complain. I promised her that when I retired we\u2019d settle down in one place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia. We built a home there, had about ten years, but then Joan got sick. Cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat brought you to Cedar Cove?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer for a long moment. Dusk was descending, the lights\u2019 reflection playing on the still waters. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay in that house anymore. I moved to a condo in San Diego, but it didn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019d been up to Washington, the Seattle area, several times. Some friends had invited me to visit after the funeral, and then I came back almost every year. I took the ferry across to Bremerton a couple of years ago. On a whim, I went to Cedar Cove and walked around a bit. I liked it. The people were friendly and I was looking for somewhere new to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your sons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid wanted me to move closer to him\u2014he lives in Arizona\u2014but that didn\u2019t appeal to me. He was planning to take care of me, but I don\u2019t ever want to be a burden to my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Charlotte had the same concerns. She sincerely doubted that Ben would ever be a burden to anyone. He was a proud, capable man, independent by nature.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver a year now.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem possible.</p><p>Ben glanced at his watch and seemed surprised by the time. \u201cMy goodness, it\u2019s almost nine-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d Charlotte was sure he\u2019d made a mistake. They\u2019d come here shortly after eight, since the council meeting, which started at seven, had lasted only an hour.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an easy woman to talk to, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>She felt her heart flutter at his praise. \u201cThank you.\u201d What she didn\u2019t say was that Ben Rhodes was an easy man to listen to\u2014an easy man to like.</p><p>Four</p><p>Rosie Cox hadn\u2019t taught grade school in years. Sixteen years, to be exact. When Allison was born, Zach and Rosie had made the decision that she\u2019d be a stay-at-home mother. For years she proudly wore her Every Mother Is A Working Mother pin. Her views about women\u2019s role within the family had leaned toward the militant. A mother\u2019s love and care, especially in the early stages of child development, was vital. At one time, Rosie had prided herself on being the world\u2019s best mother, best wife and best housekeeper. Okay, the housekeeping part was a stretch, but as far as parenthood went, she read all the books, talked to the experts and attended the latest classes. She\u2019d been determined to do everything right by her family.</p><p>When Allison and Eddie were both in school, Rosie had briefly toyed with the idea of rejoining the workforce as a teacher. She had the credentials, the hours were ideal and she could have summers off with the kids. There hadn\u2019t been any positions available, but she\u2019d dipped her toe in the employment pool one autumn a few years back, when she\u2019d worked as a cashier in a drugstore. That, however, hadn\u2019t lasted long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Eddie entered first grade, Rosie was already involved in a handful of volunteer jobs, which she thoroughly enjoyed. She wanted to contribute to the community and initially Zach had encouraged this. If she wanted to volunteer her services, then it was fine by him, since they\u2019d learned to survive quite adequately on one income. Later, her husband had come to resent the hours she gave to these organizations, and complained that she was gone far too many nights. In the end, it was apparent that Zach didn\u2019t want her working, but didn\u2019t approve of her volunteering, either. What he wanted, she realized bitterly, was an old-fashioned wife, subject to his needs and desires. A glorified housekeeper, and never mind the bedroom part because he was obviously getting that somewhere else.</p><p>Volunteering had fulfilled her, but that was then and this was now. With the divorce final and the joint custody agreement in place\u2014even if it was the most unusual one on record\u2014Rosie had to find a way of supporting herself.</p><p>Her options were limited. After a few refresher classes, which she took over the summer, she was hired by the school district as a substitute teacher. She\u2019d been counting on that. She was in line for a full-time position once an opening became available. Being a substitute, fewer hours equaled less pay, and that worried her until she was assured she could have as many hours as she wanted.</p><p>Sure enough, yesterday, the first day of school, she\u2019d been called in to teach a second-grade class at Evergreen Elementary. This was Wednesday, day two of her new working life.</p> <p>By late afternoon, Rosie\u2019s feet were throbbing and she could feel the beginnings of a migraine. Teaching wasn\u2019t easy, but it was manageable, she told herself. Mrs. Gough, the regular teacher, had had her appendix out over the Labor Day weekend and would be out of the classroom for two to three weeks, depending on her rate of recovery. As a result, Rosie would have a steady income for much of September.</p><p>It was almost five by the time she was ready to leave the school. Most, if not all, of the other teachers had gone for the day. The janitor was pushing a broom down the deserted hallway when she walked out of her classroom.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d she said as she strolled past him, struggling to smile.</p><p>He acknowledged her with a nod and methodically continued his task.</p><p>Climbing into her SUV, she mentally patted herself on the back. She\u2019d been awarded the vehicle, a Ford Explorer, as part of the divorce settlement. Zach had to either give her the Explorer or buy her an equivalent replacement, since her own car was old and becoming unreliable. He chose to give up the car, but then she\u2019d known he would.</p> <p>Both of them had sunk pretty low during the negotiations that led to their divorce settlement. Rosie had been unaware of how petty she could be, how...mean. She\u2019d actually hated Zach for what he was doing to her and to their family, and she wanted to hurt him as much as he\u2019d hurt her. He appeared to feel the same way.</p><p>Rosie turned onto Pelican Court</p><p>and pulled into their driveway, heaving a giant sigh. It was good to be home. She was eager to talk to her children and learn how their days had gone. Allison attended CedarCoveHigh School and Eddie was in fifth grade at Lincoln Elementary. Exhausted though she was, Rosie longed to hear about their classes. She might even order pizza, which would be a treat in these days of tight budgets. The three of them deserved something special.</p><p>The garage door was closed and Rosie frowned when it opened and she saw Zach\u2019s new vehicle parked in her spot. What was that about? Getting out of the car, she slammed the door. The last thing she wanted to do was deal with him, especially after the day she\u2019d just had.</p><p>She hesitated at the door, wondering if she should knock, then decided this was her house as much as his. Without bothering to announce her arrival, she barreled into the kitchen from the door off the garage.</p><p>Sure enough, Zach was in her kitchen wearing a ridiculous-looking apron. Both kids were with him, which irritated her further. Eddie sat at the table doing his homework, and Allison was standing at the sink peeling potatoes. This was a sight she could hardly believe, especially since the kids seemed to be performing these tasks willingly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she demanded, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Zach asked, glancing up. His smile faded and his eyes narrowed. His hands were buried wrist-deep in a blue ceramic bowl full of what looked like hamburger and cracker crumbs. Ah, now she understood. This was his pitiful attempt at meat loaf. A year ago they\u2019d had a big fight over her not serving him a three-course meal every night when he came home from the office. He seemed to think she had nothing to do all day but hang around the house and watch soap operas and trashy talk shows.</p><p>\u201cMeat loaf?\u201d she asked, making no effort to disguise her sneer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my night with the kids,\u201d Zach said. His hands froze as he glared malevolently at her.</p><p>The hell it was. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Rosie wasn\u2019t backing down. It was bad enough having Zach in her house. She hated every minute of this switching back and forth. She\u2019d memorized the schedule: she was with the children every Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and then Zach was at the house Thursday, Friday and Saturdays, plus holidays. She\u2019d felt triumphant about getting that extra day, but she\u2019d had to give up the major holidays for it. The trade-off didn\u2019t seem fair, but it was the best deal Sharon Castor had been able to get her.</p><p>\u201cMonday was a holiday,\u201d Zach reminded her.</p><p>Crossing her arms, Rosie gave him a slow, sardonic smile. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonday was Labor Day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad has the holidays, Mom. Remember? So he\u2019s supposed to get an extra day this week.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Allison to side with her father. Rosie frowned at her daughter. She\u2019d asked her a thousand times to peel potatoes for dinner. In response Allison always gave her the beleaguered look of an overworked galley slave. But let her father ask...</p><p>\u201cWe decided last month that instead of me coming here on the less important holidays, we\u2019d simply tack a day onto my usual week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did?\u201d She vaguely remembered some discussion having to do with Labor Day, but it had slipped her mind with all the craziness that surrounded her first day of school. The situation would be the same for Columbus Day the following month, she realized.</p><p>\u201cDo you want my attorney to mail you the paperwork\u2014complete with your signature?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to get sarcastic with me,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Eddie slammed his book closed and covered both ears. \u201cStop it!\u201d he screamed. \u201cJust stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow look what you\u2019ve done,\u201d Rosie flared, placing her arm protectively around her son\u2019s shoulders. Eddie had always been a sensitive child.</p><p>Zach\u2019s gaze bored holes into her. \u201cThis is my time with my children,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d leave.\u201d</p><p>Rosie opened her mouth, intent on arguing, but he was right. She was the one who\u2019d made the mistake.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said with as much dignity as she could muster, which at this point was very little. She sent her son and daughter a reassuring smile, then walked out of the house.</p><p>Tears burned just below the surface as she climbed back inside the Explorer. This wouldn\u2019t happen again; she\u2019d make sure of it. From here on out, she\u2019d have the days clearly marked on the calendar so there wouldn\u2019t be a repeat of this dreadful scene.</p><p>The apartment she shared with Zach was less than a mile away from the house. She pulled into the assigned parking slot and turned off the engine. The neighborhood wasn\u2019t as good, but the rent was reasonable.</p><p>Everything inside the apartment was neatly divided. She had her own shelf in the refrigerator and Zach had his. She kept her personal items locked inside one bedroom, and his were locked in the other\u2014not that she cared what he did or didn\u2019t have.</p><p>The apartment was hot and, unlike the house, lacked air-conditioning. Rosie turned on the television for noise and then took two aspirin and plunked down in front of the television set. The news was on, but she had no interest in world events. It was all she could do to deal with what was happening in her own life.</p><p>She must have fallen asleep because the phone woke her. Startled, she leaped off the couch and raced into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said breathlessly, not sounding anything like her normal self.</p><p>The person on the other end of the line hesitated. \u201cI think I have the wrong number,\u201d the woman said softly.</p><p>Rosie would recognize that voice anywhere. It was Janice Lamond, the home-wrecker who\u2019d stolen her husband. The woman who\u2019d carefully planned to ruin Rosie\u2019s life. She seethed with anger and resentment.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think you\u2019ve made a mistake,\u201d she said, letting the intense dislike she felt for the other woman show in her voice. Because nothing further needed to be said, she took delight in banging down the receiver. Her hand shook, and leaning against the kitchen counter, Rosie fought back angry tears.</p><p>Zach was dating. He had been even before the divorce was final. Even before he\u2019d moved out. She was the one who\u2019d honored her wedding vows, the one who\u2019d cared for the house and the family while her so-called husband had an affair. It hurt even now to realize that the man she\u2019d trusted implicitly and loved beyond measure had become involved with another woman.</p><p>Rosie poured herself a cold orange juice and walked back into the tiny living room. Slouching down on the sofa, she stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>Two could play that game, she decided. Rosie didn\u2019t know why it had taken her so long to figure that out.</p><p>It was high time she found herself a boyfriend.</p><p>With the latest issue of The Cedar Cove Chronicle at the printer\u2019s, Jack Griffin had a rare free afternoon, and a beautiful September afternoon it was. Normally he\u2019d spend the time with Olivia, but now he was at loose ends and in a hell of a mood.</p><p>He\u2019d been playing it cool, doing his best to hide his true feelings about Olivia. He wasn\u2019t fooling anyone, least of all his best friend, Bob Beldon. Bob was more than a friend, he was Jack\u2019s AA sponsor, and between them they had almost thirty years\u2019 sobriety.</p><p>He parked his battered, fifteen-year-old Ford Taurus outside the Beldons\u2019 B and B, Thyme and Tide. Jack paused long enough to take in the view from across the cove. It really was lovely. Breathtaking. In the distance the huge green-and-white Seattle ferry was easing into the Bremerton dock. Seagulls hovered over the water. Closer at hand, statuesque herons walked delicately along the shore, picking at the exposed seabed with thin beaks while the tide lapped at their feet. A line of foam scalloped the rocky beach.</p><p>Peggy was busy clipping herbs in her garden, wearing a large straw hat to shade her face from the late-afternoon sun. She straightened when she saw him, a basket over her arm.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she greeted him warmly. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen nearly enough of you in the last little while.\u201d Hurrying across the lawn, she kissed him lightly on the cheek. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a beautiful afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure is, Peggy.\u201d He paused. \u201cIs Bob around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, no. He\u2019s off with Pastor Flemming. I don\u2019t know how he did it, but Dave Flemming\u2019s got Bob working with the teenagers\u2019 basketball team.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frankly, Jack didn\u2019t know how the minister had managed it, either. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you and Bob were churchgoing people,\u201d he said, puzzlement in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t used to be,\u201d Peggy admitted. \u201cNot until...\u201d An unknown man had died in their home the previous winter, and\u2014understandably\u2014that had shaken them up. The circumstances were shrouded in mystery. The John Doe had arrived in the middle of a storm; he\u2019d carried false identification and had yet to be identified. So many questions remained unanswered, and some people seemed to think Bob and Peggy might be involved. If the stranger had died at his house, Jack suspected he might start attending church, too.</p><p>Peggy, willowy and energetic as always, headed toward the kitchen as though she expected Jack to follow. He did so willingly. Peggy was the kind of woman who made everyone feel welcome. It was her gift and made her a natural in the bed-and-breakfast business.</p><p>She held the screen door open for Jack and set her basket on the counter. \u201cI just made a fresh pitcher of iced tea,\u201d she announced, and then, without asking, automatically poured two tall glasses. She arranged several large peanut butter cookies on a plate, as well.</p> <p>With Jack carrying the tray, they walked to the patio. He set it down on the table and began to make an excuse to leave as soon as politeness allowed. He changed his mind; after all, he\u2019d come here hoping for a distraction from his thoughts about Olivia.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you expect Bob?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAround five, I guess,\u201d Peggy told him.</p><p>A quick glance at his watch assured Jack that was only thirty minutes off.</p><p>\u201cAfter Dan Sherman\u2019s death...\u201d Peggy began. She hesitated. \u201cBob took that hard.\u201d</p> <p>As a relative newcomer, Jack didn\u2019t remember Bob being especially close to the former lumberman. Thinking about it, though, he recalled that Grace Sherman had asked Bob to speak at the memorial service held for Dan. That had surprised Jack at the time, but he hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>As if reading his mind, Peggy explained. \u201cBob and Dan used to be good friends in high school. Dan\u2019s death really disturbed him, and then of course there was...\u201d She shrugged and met Jack\u2019s eyes. He knew she was talking about the stranger.</p><p>\u201cAfter Dan was buried, Bob decided he\u2019d like to start attending church services,\u201d Peggy continued. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t mind. In fact, I\u2019ve wanted to go for quite a while. Funny how death tends to unnerve us, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Jack smiled wanly, disinclined to chat. But after a few minutes, the silence became uncomfortable, so he tried to fill it with questions. \u201cBob and Dan didn\u2019t see much of each other lately, did they?\u201d</p><p>Peggy shook her head. \u201cNot since they got back from Vietnam, but Dan was never the same after the war. They drifted apart. I don\u2019t think Dan was much of a drinker, but Bob was...well, you know about his problems with the bottle as well as anyone.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cFriends can do that,\u201d he said, thinking more about himself and Olivia than Dan Sherman and Bob. \u201cDrift apart, I mean.\u201d Only his relationship with Olivia hadn\u2019t exactly drifted, it had been abruptly cut off. His gut twisted, and if he didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d think he had the beginnings of an ulcer. When he reached for his iced tea, he noticed Peggy studying him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave I?\u201d If so, he was grateful. He had a bit of a paunch that had come with middle age and a demanding desk job. There wasn\u2019t much time for exercise, and meals often consisted of what he could get from a vending machine.</p><p>\u201cI suspect it has something to do with Olivia. You\u2019re obviously miserable.\u201d</p><p>Now, that was below the belt. Jack nearly groaned aloud. \u201cUnfair,\u201d he muttered. \u201cAnd Olivia\u2019s off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Peggy murmured, apparently content to abide by his wishes. \u201cBut I do have one thing to tell you and then I\u2019ll shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing?\u201d he repeated. \u201cJust one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Peggy said, \u201cand I think you\u2019ll find this interesting. I had to go down to the courthouse the other day and everyone in the whole building was buzzing about another of Olivia\u2019s decisions.\u201d She paused, as if waiting for him to bite.</p><p>Funny Jack hadn\u2019t already heard about it. Curiosity got the best of him and he swallowed the bait. \u201cWhat did she do this time?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>Peggy explained the controversial joint custody decision Olivia had made. \u201cI wish more judges would take the children\u2019s needs into consideration,\u201d she said.</p><p>This willingness to employ common sense in her courtroom was what had first attracted Jack to Olivia. He\u2019d been surprised\u2014and impressed\u2014when a year earlier, she\u2019d basically denied a young couple a divorce.</p><p>Everyone in the courtroom could tell that Ian and Cecilia Randall were still in love. They\u2019d lost an infant daughter, and the death of their baby had ripped them apart. Olivia had not only recognized their emotional confusion and their need for each other, she\u2019d boldly acted upon it. The last Jack had heard, Ian and Cecilia were together again.</p><p>Peggy was staring at him.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Olivia in weeks.\u201d Jack helped himself to a cookie. Six weeks to be precise, not that he was counting. All right, all right, he knew down to the day and the hour, which he wasn\u2019t admitting to anyone.</p><p>\u201cJack, that\u2019s terrible!\u201d</p><p>No kidding. Well, he didn\u2019t much like it, either, but he\u2019d backed himself into a corner. It was an impossible situation, and his ego demanded he stay exactly where he was.</p><p>\u201cYou miss her, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He started to say that after a while it wasn\u2019t so bad, then stopped abruptly. Hell, who did he think he was fooling? It was worse than ever, especially in the past few weeks. \u201cShe seems to be doing okay. I hear Stan Lockhart is hanging around a lot these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Olivia dating her ex-husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to Charlotte.\u201d Jack nearly bit his tongue in his eagerness to close his mouth. He hadn\u2019t meant to let Peggy know he\u2019d been commiserating with Olivia\u2019s mother. Charlotte was his biggest supporter. She\u2019d told him that she\u2019d nagged Olivia to mend fences with Jack; unfortunately, Olivia didn\u2019t seem inclined to admit the error of her ways.</p><p>Jack set the cookie aside, his appetite gone. \u201cApparently Olivia\u2019s got some bug up her butt about how I should be making a play for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he said, growing impatient. \u201cShe wants me to\u2014in her words\u2014show some gumption and fight for her.\u201d</p><p>Peggy frowned. \u201cShe wants you to fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe not a knock-down, drag-out fistfight but...hell, I don\u2019t know what she wants.\u201d He assumed she was expecting him to come on bended knee and beg her forgiveness. He had too much pride for that. If she was interested in him, the same way he was interested in her, then that high school, high-drama stuff shouldn\u2019t be necessary. For a woman who supposedly knew so much about human nature, Olivia had fallen decidedly short on figuring this out.</p><p>\u201cYou might send her flowers,\u201d Peggy suggested.</p><p>Jack had already thought of that. \u201cI don\u2019t have a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReason? What do you mean, reason?\u201d Peggy repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou know...her birthday, Christmas, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, Jack, Jack,\u201d Peggy said slowly. \u201cYou have a reason. You want her back, don\u2019t you? This nonsense has gone on long enough. That\u2019s all she wants to hear. She\u2019s waiting for you to make the first move.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, well, Jack was waiting, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re at a standoff,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do something fast, you\u2019ll lose her. If she intended to get together with her ex, don\u2019t you think she\u2019d be with him by now? Good grief.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cStan must be overjoyed by all this.\u201d</p><p>Jack scowled ferociously. He\u2019d thought plenty about that slimy bastard who\u2019d once been married to Olivia, and heaven knew Jack didn\u2019t want to do Stanley Lockhart any favors. \u201cI suppose you think I should pour my heart out on one of those dinky cards, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Peggy said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t be like you.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully she knew him well enough to recognize that. \u201cWhat should I say, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy say anything? Just write your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>Peggy nodded. \u201cAll Olivia needs is some indication that you care.\u201d</p><p>It was that easy? Nah\u2014couldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d It sounded like good advice, and at this point, he was willing to try just about anything\u2014especially if he could hold on to his pride at the same time.</p><p>Peggy shoved the cookie plate in his direction and Jack took the last one. \u201cI hope you do it,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Peggy had certainly given him something to think about, but now he was anxious to turn the subject away from Olivia. \u201cI happened to run into Roy McAfee the other day,\u201d Jack said. The retired Seattle police detective had put out his shingle as a private investigator shortly after he\u2019d moved to Cedar Cove. Jack knew that Roy had talked to Bob and Peggy extensively about the John Doe who\u2019d checked into their B and B\u2014and never checked out. The medical examiner still hadn\u2019t determined the cause of death.</p><p>\u201cIs Roy still working on our big mystery?\u201d Peggy asked, her eyes troubled.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t mention anything, but I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>Peggy became quiet and thoughtful. \u201cI wish he would,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>\u201cInvestigate your John Doe?\u201d Jack prodded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if...as if he landed here from another planet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Roy might be able to find out something the police can\u2019t?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d She shifted in her seat and suddenly seemed uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...\u201d Again she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Bob. That night, he casually said there was something familiar about our guest. But with the way he arrived, so late and without a reservation, Bob couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. I think there might be more to this than meets the eye.\u201d</p><p>Bob and Jack were close. He knew Bob had scoured his brain looking for a connection and been unable to come up with one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been married to Bob for over thirty years...\u201d Peggy\u2019s voice dropped to a whisper. She darted a glance at him. \u201cDid he ever tell you about his nightmares?\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t. \u201cWe all have bad dreams at one time or another.\u201d Jack hadn\u2019t gone to Vietnam himself, but he knew plenty of men who had. Nightmares weren\u2019t uncommon for a man who\u2019d been to war.</p><p>\u201cTwice now...\u201d She sighed. \u201cSometimes, through the years, Bob\u2019s sleepwalked.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned forward. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t think he had anything to do with your guest\u2019s death?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Her eyes widened in horror. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible! The bedroom door was locked from the inside.\u201d</p><p>But Jack knew they had a key, so that wasn\u2019t a viable excuse.</p><p>\u201cAnd there wasn\u2019t a scratch on him.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. That was true.</p> <p>\u201cBesides, you know Bob. He can barely swat a fly. It just isn\u2019t in him to purposely hurt anyone or anything.\u201d</p><p>Peggy was right. \u201cThen why do you want Bob to talk to a private investigator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want Bob to talk, I guess. It doesn\u2019t matter to whom. After I saw how upset he was over Dan\u2019s death, coupled with the recurring nightmares\u2014well, I just think it would do him good to get it off his chest. He\u2019s always so afraid that he might start walking in his sleep again.\u201d</p><p>Jack could appreciate her concern. \u201cDo you want me to say anything to him?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt might do more harm than good. If he thinks I\u2019ve been talking about him\u2014even with you\u2014he\u2019d just get upset.\u201d</p> <p>Jack noticed the way she clenched and unclenched her hands, and he realized that Peggy was afraid. Even though she\u2019d denied it, she was afraid her husband might have had something to do with the stranger\u2019s death.</p><p>Was that possible? Could Bob be involved?</p><p>Five</p><p>Sunday afternoon, the day Katie turned one month old, Maryellen paced the living room floor, holding her daughter against her chest. The doorbell chimed and she froze. Jon had come for Katie, to take her home for the night. This was the first time since she\u2019d been born that Maryellen had to surrender her to Jon. Until today, he\u2019d visited almost daily, usually staying only an awkward few minutes. Now he\u2019d be taking her on his rotation days off, returning the next afternoon. Already she knew that abiding by their agreement wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p><p>Reluctantly, she set Katie back in her bassinet and opened the front door. Jon stood on the other side of the screen, dressed casually in jeans and a short-sleeved shirt. His long dark hair was pulled away from his face and tied in a ponytail.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look great\u2014both of you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJon.\u201d Despite her resolve not to be emotional, her voice trembled.</p><p>If he noticed her distress, he ignored it. \u201cIs Katie ready?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. She held the door open for him. \u201cI\u2019ve packed everything you\u2019ll need.\u201d She reached for the diaper bag and pulled out a container of breast milk she\u2019d pumped and several empty bottles. \u201cShe only takes about three ounces, some-times four, at a time. You\u2019ll probably have to get up twice during the night, and she isn\u2019t all that accustomed to the bottle, so I don\u2019t know how she\u2019ll do.\u201d She swallowed again, trying to hide her reservations. \u201cYou will hear her if she cries, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a light sleeper.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the way Maryellen remembered it. On their one night together she\u2019d managed to gather her clothes and sneak halfway down the stairs before he noticed she was gone.</p><p>\u201cI put three extra outfits in her diaper bag in case she needs a change\u2014and extra diapers, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He walked over to the bassinet, which she\u2019d brought into the living room this morning. \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t know they still had these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was mine,\u201d Maryellen told him. \u201cMom saved it and then gave it to Kelly when she had Tyler. Kelly passed it along to me for Katie.\u201d</p> <p>Jon smiled down at his daughter; the infant seemed to smile back and started moving both arms. Jon placed his hand over her tiny stomach.</p><p>\u201cShe likes her yellow blanket best....\u201d Maryellen said. \u201cMy mom knit it for her and I think she sleeps better with it.\u201d She was rambling, but she couldn\u2019t help herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure the blanket is always with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a car seat. State law demands that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have one.\u201d</p><p>Not once had his gaze wavered from their daughter, and Maryellen saw him make silly faces at her. The tenderness in his eyes made her want to weep.</p><p>\u201cShe tends to be fussy first thing in the morning,\u201d she told him, and bit her lip to keep it from trembling.</p><p>\u201cShe must get that from you,\u201d Jon said, briefly glancing toward her. \u201cAs I recall, you\u2019re not much of a morning person, either.\u201d</p><p>Apparently he was reminding her of their night together. Maryellen immediately wanted to defend herself, but she was afraid that if she said one more word, she\u2019d burst into tears. His having Katie had sounded like a reasonable solution a couple of months ago. Katie was Jon\u2019s daughter, and it was his legal right to spend time with her. But Maryellen hadn\u2019t realized when she\u2019d agreed to this how bereft she\u2019d feel. How lost and unsettled...</p><p>Jon carefully bent down and scooped his daughter into his arms. It was all Maryellen could do not to rush forward at the clumsy way he handled their baby. Sheer determination kept her where she was. Jon wouldn\u2019t appreciate her intervention.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her out and put her in the car seat,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rather than respond verbally, Maryellen nodded. She followed closely behind, carrying the diaper bag. While Jon fiddled with the car seat, she waited anxiously to be sure he had Katie properly secured.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will you have her back?\u201d she asked, although she already knew.</p><p>\u201cBefore five.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-four hours.</p><p>Jon closed the back door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll phone if you need anything?\u201d</p><p>He walked around the vehicle, a brand-new sedan, and opened the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cOf course. I have your number next to the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...good.\u201d Maryellen clung to the top of the door while he climbed inside and inserted the key in the ignition. The warning bell instantly started to chime. Reluctantly she stepped back and Jon pulled the door shut.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be fine,\u201d he assured her through the half-open window.</p><p>\u201cI know...it\u2019s just that we\u2019ve never been apart before.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s eyes went blank as he looked past her. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted it like this. I\u2019m only going along with your wishes.\u201d</p><p>Her wishes, she longed to remind him, had been to keep him entirely in the dark about their daughter. She hadn\u2019t originally planned to involve him because she\u2019d believed Jon wouldn\u2019t want anything to do with their child. But she\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Tears blurred her vision. Normally Maryellen wasn\u2019t a volatile or weepy person, but the pregnancy and birth had thrown her hormones off-kilter. At the slightest excuse\u2014a television ad, watching her beautiful daughter sleep, even folding baby clothes\u2014Maryellen would find herself on the verge of tears.</p><p>Jon was about to drive away from the curb when he glanced at her and stopped. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded forcefully and hurriedly wiped a stray tear from her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling emotional lately. That\u2019s all.\u201d Wrapping her arms protectively about her waist, she moved onto the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cNew-mother blues,\u201d he said knowledgeably. \u201cI read about it in one of the books I checked out of the library. It\u2019ll pass in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know,\u201d she said. Maryellen could read, too, but pointing that out just now seemed childish and petty. She didn\u2019t want to say anything to irritate him, especially when he had their baby in his vehicle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow afternoon,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered. She could sleep in, Maryellen told herself. After a month of getting up at all hours of the night, sometimes two and three times, she should be grate-ful for a single night of uninterrupted rest. All this anxiety was a by-product of too many nights walking the floor and too little sleep. Not to mention those rampant hormones...</p><p>Once inside the house, Maryellen straightened the living room. She picked up the rattle, which was a gift from Jon; it had arrived in a huge basket of flowers he\u2019d had delivered to the hospital. The burp rag draped over the end of the couch got tossed in the washing machine.</p><p>Tidying the bassinet, Maryellen sat up the large white teddy bear Jon had given Katie before she was born. The house was full of small gifts he\u2019d brought either before or after the birth. Everywhere she looked there was evidence that he was determined to be part of Katie\u2019s life. He was serious about it and she knew he wasn\u2019t going to let his commitment slide, so she\u2019d better get used to it now.</p><p>That night Maryellen slept miserably. She tossed and turned, certain that Katie needed her, certain Jon wouldn\u2019t hear when she stirred in the middle of the night. A hundred regrets besieged her. She\u2019d handed her daughter over to him without once checking to be sure he was adequately prepared to deal with an infant. Maryellen envisioned Katie crying in a wet diaper with an empty stomach while Jon slept, blissfully unaware that she needed attention.</p><p>By seven the next morning, Maryellen had worked herself into a near-frenzy. Three times she reached for the phone, but she was afraid she\u2019d wake him, or worse, Katie. When she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, she dressed hastily and drove to her mother\u2019s house.</p><p>Fortunately Grace was up, having coffee at her kitchen table. She opened the back door for Maryellen, and Buttercup greeted her delightedly, tail wagging. Maryellen stepped into the kitchen, took one look at her mother and burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen! My goodness, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing...Everything. Jon has Katie.\u201d</p><p>Her mother poured her a cup of coffee. \u201cSit down and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen felt foolish and overemotional and everything she\u2019d never wanted to be. This was so unlike her. \u201cYou have to get ready for work,\u201d she said between sobs.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll get dressed, and while I do, you can talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Dabbing her eyes, Maryellen followed her mother into the bedroom. She paused when she entered. \u201cYou painted in here.\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen shrugged. \u201cI guess...I didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with the old color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t, but I had some things I needed to work out in my mind and painting helped.\u201d</p><p>Caught up in her own world, Maryellen feared she\u2019d failed her mother, that she hadn\u2019t paid enough attention to the difficulties Grace was confronting. This summer had been traumatic for them both. \u201cAnything I can do to help?\u201d she asked as she sat on the end of her parents\u2019 bed. Her mother pulled a blouse and jumper from her closet.</p><p>Grace shook her head. \u201cNo, but thanks. Besides, you didn\u2019t come here at this hour to ask about me. Now, tell me what\u2019s got you so upset.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen wasn\u2019t upset as much as she was worried. \u201cJon\u2019s never had Katie before.... I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll miss me. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.\u201d</p><p>Her mother pulled a full-length black slip over her head. \u201cWait until eight-thirty or so and then give him a call,\u201d she advised. \u201cMy guess is that Jon will be more than happy to hear from you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maryellen hoped that was the case. She didn\u2019t want him to think she was intruding on his time with Katie, but he had to understand how difficult this was for her.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Grace said as she finished dressing. \u201cLet me put on my makeup and fuss a bit with my hair, and then I\u2019ll buy you breakfast before I go to work.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen declined with a shake of her head. \u201cI can\u2019t eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d her mother insisted. \u201cAnd you will. Now, come on, it isn\u2019t every day I offer to treat you to breakfast. The Pancake Palace has an early bird special. All-you-can-eat pancakes for a buck.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother was right, Maryellen realized. She needed a meal\u2014and a distraction.</p><p>By the time she left the Pancake Palace, Maryellen felt worlds better, although they\u2019d done more socializing with others than talking between themselves. The restaurant obviously did a thriving breakfast business. They\u2019d run into Charlotte Jefferson and the members of the New Knee Club who met there once a month. Everyone at the long table had gone through knee-replacement surgery. Charlotte introduced them to her friend Ben Rhodes, a distinguished-looking older man. They appeared to have a relationship that was more than friendly, at least in Maryellen\u2019s opinion. She couldn\u2019t help wondering if there was a romance in the offing. It was kind of cute.</p><p>She got home after nine and headed directly for the phone, figuring Jon would be up with Katie by now. When there was no answer, she left a short message on his machine and dejectedly replaced the receiver.</p><p>At ten she called again. Still no answer. She couldn\u2019t stand not knowing and drove to Jon\u2019s home near Olalla. Her heart pounded frantically as she parked and climbed out of her car.</p><p>Even before she reached his front door, Jon had it open. Katie was in his arms, held firmly against his shoulder. She was astonished to see her daughter raising her head and peering around.</p> <p>\u201cMaryellen,\u201d Jon said, stepping aside. \u201cCome on in.\u201d</p><p>His home was almost complete now. On her last visit, the finish work had only been partially done. But today she saw that there was a carpet in the living area\u2014a lovely Berber rug in soft greens and grays\u2014and the oak woodwork around the windows overlooking Puget Sound was beautifully varnished. She could see Vashon Island in the distance, and the view of Mount Rainier, majestic and serene beyond the island, was stunning enough to make her heart skip.</p><p>Now that Maryellen was here it was obvious to her that Jon had managed just fine. \u201cYou...you didn\u2019t answer the phone,\u201d she stammered, \u201cand...and I didn\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d She gave a quick shrug. \u201cI was worried, but I can see that everything\u2019s gone great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must\u2019ve been in the shower,\u201d he explained, \u201cor on the balcony.\u201d</p> <p>He seemed so easy with Katie now. During his brief visits, he\u2019d lifted her as if she were a bag of unwieldy potatoes, and now he was as natural with her as a...dad.</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s anxiety had been for nothing. She felt embarrassed about rushing out to rescue her daughter. Jon had everything under control.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see Katie\u2019s room?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Maryellen nodded. Hindsight being what it was, she should\u2019ve checked on all this before she handed over their daughter.</p><p>Jon led her up the open stairway. She loved the house and the fact that he\u2019d done most of the construction work himself. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything Jon Bowman couldn\u2019t master.</p><p>His bedroom was at the top of the stairs, and the French doors leading to the balcony were open. She could imagine him sitting there at first light, holding Katie and talking to her about the panorama outside.</p><p>Maryellen glanced into the bedroom and caught sight of his unmade bed and the photograph of her, beautifully framed and positioned on the opposite wall. She\u2019d first seen it on display in a gallery in Seattle, where the majority of his work was now sold. It had been taken on a foggy afternoon while she stood on the pier next to the marina; she\u2019d had no idea he was there. Her back was to the camera and she\u2019d raised her arm to toss popcorn to the seagulls. The photograph had an exciting, dynamic quality, and yet the misty air gave it a sense of whimsy, too.</p><p>Jon seemed a bit flustered that she\u2019d noticed the photograph. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my favorites,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you mind that I have it here?\u201d</p> <p>The odd thing was she didn\u2019t. It gladdened her to see that he kept it in this room, although she didn\u2019t dare analyze the reasons. \u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d With that, he took her down the hallway to Katie\u2019s room.</p><p>Maryellen swallowed a gasp of delight when she saw the charming room. Jon had painted a zoo scene on one wall. Giraffes and elephants, zebras and monkeys appeared in a variety of realistic poses.</p><p>\u201cYou did this?\u201d she asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t quite finished.\u201d He pointed to an area that had been drawn but not yet colored.</p><p>All the furniture was new. He\u2019d bought an infant swing and a crib with a canopy. A high chair stood in the corner; presumably he\u2019d move it down to the kitchen when Katie was ready for it. Maryellen\u2019s previous worry seemed even more ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she told him. \u201cI made a fool of myself coming out here like this.\u201d She couldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI\u2019ll go now.\u201d</p><p>Jon stopped her by stretching out his arm. \u201cKatie and I want you to stay,\u201d he said, his eyes holding hers.</p><p>The lump in her throat eased as she gave him a smile. She wanted very much to spend this day with Jon and Katie.</p><p>Six</p><p>Tuesday evening, as the setting sun cast golden shadows over the cove, Grace left the library. She\u2019d spent much of the day training a new assistant, so had stayed late to deal with her own paperwork. She was tired to the point of exhaustion. Times like these, she missed Dan the most. It would\u2019ve been good to go home, have a quiet supper with him, maybe relate an anecdote or two. He\u2019d disappeared the year before last, vanished without a word and without a trace. He\u2019d hidden in a trailer deep in the woods, where he\u2019d eventually committed suicide. His experience in Vietnam had never left him\u2014the guilt and the horror of it.</p><p>After his body was found, Grace had been assailed by doubts, wondering if she could\u2019ve known, could\u2019ve helped, could\u2019ve reached him somehow. She suspected it would not have been possible, because of the agony that consumed him, an agony he\u2019d never spoken about. To her or anyone....</p><p>Most recently there\u2019d been this sadness, this emptiness she couldn\u2019t shake. Her husband was dead and she\u2019d lived without him for a long while and yet she couldn\u2019t get used to his absence. That confused her. Theirs had never been a vibrant, happy marriage, but they\u2019d made the best of it. They\u2019d loved each other; that much she knew. She\u2019d been wrong to think she\u2019d be ready for another relationship so soon. She\u2019d assumed all the grieving was over. Now she wondered if it would ever end. What she wanted was the life she\u2019d had before Dan disappeared.</p><p>While he\u2019d never been an overly affectionate husband, there was a certain comfort in the routines they shared. He\u2019d bring in the mail and the newspaper every afternoon. She cooked the meals. In the evenings, they\u2019d sit side by side and watch television or talk, whether about their daughters or about inconsequential things\u2014incidents at work, household concerns, local news. Once a week, she\u2019d go off to aerobics class with Olivia. Dan hadn\u2019t liked having her gone, but he\u2019d never asked her to stay home. He understood how important Olivia\u2019s friendship was to her. Now the evenings were silent. Lonely. Now it was Grace who dragged the garbage can out to the curb, Grace who struggled with the lawn mower and edge trimmer, Grace who read the fine print at the bottom of the car insurance policy\u2014and she hated it.</p><p>Walking to the parking lot behind the library, she tried to shake off her depression, reminding herself\u2014as she often did\u2014that she had much for which to be grateful. After years of longing, she was a grandmother twice over. Her daughters were close to her and to each other. She had good friends, especially Olivia. Her finances were in order, and while she was a long way from living a life of luxury, she earned enough to support herself. She had the answer about Dan\u2019s disappearance, even if she didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>Life was good, or it should be.</p><p>Buttercup greeted her happily when she got home. The dog came through the pet door at five-thirty every day to wait for her; she\u2019d been well-trained by her previous owner and didn\u2019t budge from her appointed place until Grace arrived, even if she was late, as she was today. She collected the day\u2019s mail and the newspaper, murmuring apologies and endearments to Buttercup. She flipped through the advertisements and bills as she walked back to the house and paused midstep when she came across a letter from Atlanta. The return address told her it was from Will Jefferson, Olivia\u2019s older brother. Grace eagerly ripped open the envelope. She\u2019d always been fond of Will.</p><p>Standing on the sidewalk, she quickly scanned the neatly typed, one-page letter. While in high school, Grace had idolized Olivia\u2019s brother from afar. He\u2019d been a heartthrob way back then, and the years had done little to diminish his appeal. She\u2019d seen him just recently when he\u2019d flown home for Charlotte\u2019s surgery. Grace was amazed at how attractive she found him even now, thirty-seven years after she\u2019d graduated from high school.</p><p>His letter was one of condolence. He told her how sorry he was about Dan, then wrote briefly about the changes he\u2019d noticed in Cedar Cove. He said it had felt good to be home for more than just a brief visit after all these years. He added that he\u2019d enjoyed seeing her. Since his return to Atlanta, he\u2019d been talking to his wife about retiring in a few years and said he\u2019d like to consider moving back to Cedar Cove.</p><p>Grace knew Olivia and Charlotte must be thrilled at the prospect. Then she saw that under his signature, Will had included his e-mail address. He didn\u2019t ask her to write, but there it was, like an open invitation.</p><p>On her way into the house, Grace went through Will\u2019s letter a second time, trying to read between the lines. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything out of the ordinary, nothing beyond his sincere sympathy and a bit of chatty news about his future plans.</p><p>She replaced the letter inside the envelope, fed Buttercup and then turned on the television. These days her TV was more for companionship than entertainment. The evening was unseasonably warm and she dug around her refrigerator, deciding she\u2019d just have a salad. She found herself humming as she shuffled the milk carton around two small yogurt containers.</p><p>Grace stopped abruptly and straightened. When she\u2019d left the library, she\u2019d been feeling melancholy, but now her spirits were soaring. A feeling of happy anticipation filled her. The only thing she could attribute this change to was Will\u2019s letter. Was she so fickle, she wondered with some dismay, that a letter from an old friend\u2014a high school crush\u2014could improve her mood so radically?</p><p>She didn\u2019t get the opportunity to consider that. Buttercup barked once and trotted to the front door just seconds before the bell rang. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace walked over to answer it and discovered Olivia standing on the other side of her screen.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a minute?\u201d her friend asked. She looked upset, which shocked Grace, since Olivia was normally so composed.</p><p>\u201cOlivia! Of course. What\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>Her friend gestured hopelessly as if she didn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBelieve what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst I hear from Stan, and then after weeks of silence, from Jack, too. This was within a few hours of each other\u2014it\u2019s as if those two have radar and know exactly what the other is doing.\u201d</p><p>This was fabulous news as far as Grace was concerned. \u201cJack? You heard from Jack?\u201d She sat down on the sofa.</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cThe man is a weasel, that\u2019s what he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Grace asked, puzzled. \u201cWhat did he do this time?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia flopped down next to Grace. \u201cHe had flowers delivered to the house. They\u2019re gorgeous and the colors are incredible. It must\u2019ve cost him a fortune, but that\u2019s not the half of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack sent you flowers?\u201d Grace cried as though outraged. \u201cWhy, that low-down, dirty rat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called to thank him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mistake for sure,\u201d Grace said. She enjoyed seeing her friend so obviously in love with Jack\u2014and so confused by him\u2014although she wished Olivia could sort out her feelings. Naturally Stan was eager to distract her, eager to have her back, and feeling as unsettled as she did, Olivia might weaken and return to him.</p><p>Grace would say one thing for Olivia\u2019s ex-husband: his timing was impeccable. The minute Olivia got involved in another relationship\u2014up popped a repentant Stan, hoping to lure her back.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe what he said to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack or Stan?\u201d Grace was losing track.</p><p>\u201cBoth of them,\u201d Olivia cried.</p><p>\u201cStart with Stan.\u201d If Olivia was ready to have Jack arrested for sending her flowers, Grace could only imagine what her ex-husband had done.</p><p>\u201cStan phoned and wanted to take me to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Grace said, feigning a gasp. \u201cLock him up and throw away the key!\u201d</p><p>Olivia glared at her, eyes glittering with irritation. \u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me, Grace Sherman.\u201d</p><p>Grace laughed. She couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cNo one\u2019s sending me flowers and asking me to dinner these days. There\u2019s got to be some other reason you\u2019re so annoyed. Are they trying to outdo each other?\u201d That made sense\u2014but on the other hand, it seemed to be what Olivia wanted, judging by her earlier complaints.</p><p>Olivia unfolded her arms and stroked Buttercup\u2019s silky head. \u201cActually, Stan started it. He wants me to have dinner with him in Seattle on Friday night.\u201d</p> <p>Grace arched her eyebrows. \u201cWhy Seattle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a corporate dinner he\u2019s required to attend and he didn\u2019t want to go alone. He has a hotel room and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne room?\u201d</p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes. \u201cHe seems to think I\u2019m too naive to know what he\u2019s got in mind. Oh sure, the room will have two beds, but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday and I know Stanley Lockhart. He has plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe flowers arrived,\u201d she said dreamily. \u201cGrace, after all these weeks, I have to tell you I was so pleased to get them.\u201d</p><p>Grace was equally thrilled. Although it had taken Jack long enough.... \u201cWhat did the card say?\u201d</p><p>Olivia dropped her gaze. \u201cHe signed his name. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Smart man. \u201cIn other words, he made the first move and the rest is up to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou phoned him?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI did, and he answered on the first ring\u2014almost as if he\u2019d been sitting there waiting for me to call. It felt wonderful to talk to him again. We were getting along famously until\u2014\u201d Her eyes narrowed and she heaved a deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cUntil what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to dinner on Friday night, and I made the mistake of saying there must be something in the air because I was getting dinner invitations right and left.\u201d</p><p>Not the most brilliant comment, Grace agreed, but Olivia already knew that.</p><p>\u201cIt took Jack about two seconds to realize the other invitation came from Stan. Then he got all weird on me and said he was busy on Friday, after all. He wished me a lovely evening with Stan, and before I could say another word, he made some excuse and was off the phone.\u201d</p><p>Grace wanted to groan out loud.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s shoulders sank. \u201cNow you know why I\u2019m upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to dinner with Stan, are you?\u201d Grace asked, just to be sure.</p><p>\u201cNot hardly,\u201d Olivia muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m free Friday night. Want to go to the movies?\u201d</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re on, my friend. Who needs men, anyway?\u201d</p><p>Maybe, Grace decided, she\u2019d find a way to get Jack Griffin to the theater on Friday evening. Apparently there were times when romance could use a helping hand.</p><p>Rosie finished writing out the words her second-graders had to copy. She set the worn chalk down on the blackboard ledge and brushed the dust from her hands.</p><p>The bell rang, indicating class was dismissed for the day. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to remind your parents that Open House is tonight,\u201d she told the students. Open House introduced the teacher to the parents, and it usually occurred in the third week of September.</p><p>The children leaped up from their desks, grabbed their bags and backpacks, then dashed out. All except Jolene Peyton. The little girl with the long dark pigtails wore a forlorn look as she walked, head bowed, to the front of the room.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, Jolene?\u201d Rosie asked gently.</p><p>The little girl kept her eyes lowered. \u201cOnly my daddy can come tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful. I look forward to meeting him.\u201d</p><p>Jolene slowly raised her head until her eyes met Rosie\u2019s. \u201cMy mommy died in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, sweetheart, and I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Rosie\u2019s heart went out to the motherless little girl.</p><p>\u201cEvery week Daddy and I put flowers by the road where she died.\u201d</p><p>Rosie knew that, too. The flowers and balloons often caught her eye at the busy intersection.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad your father\u2019s coming to the Open House,\u201d Rosie said.</p><p>Jolene nodded. \u201cHe said it was one of those things Mommy would do if she was still here.\u201d</p><p>Rosie tucked her arm around the seven-year-old\u2019s shoulder. It was apparent even now, almost two years after the accident, that Jolene missed her mother.</p><p>\u201cI told my daddy that I need a mommy, and he said he\u2019d think about it.\u201d She sighed deeply. \u201cHe says that a lot.\u201d</p><p>So did she, Rosie thought with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d was in every mother\u2019s repertoire.</p><p>That evening as the classroom started to fill with parents, Rosie made it a point to seek out Jolene\u2019s father. The little girl led him into the classroom, then rushed to bring him juice and cookies from the table set up at the front.</p><p>While he waited for his daughter, Bruce Peyton stood in the background, not mingling with the other parents. He was nice-looking, but he had a somber air about him, a remoteness, which was perfectly understandable. School events such as this evening\u2019s must be a painful reminder that he was alone. He was of average height and on the thin side. His clothes hung loose on him. Rosie could only assume this was due to a recent weight loss. His eyes were an intense blue, compelling her to steal glances in his direction.</p><p>It\u2019d been many years\u2014decades\u2014since Rosie had really looked at another man. Her flirting skills had rusted from lack of use, although she was confident Janice Lamond could teach her a thing or two.</p><p>When Rosie was free she made her way toward Bruce. She smiled and held out her hand. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Rosie Cox, Jolene\u2019s teacher. I just want to say I\u2019m very sorry about your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d The widower\u2019s smile was fleeting and he clasped her hand for only a few seconds. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cox is a good teacher, but she\u2019s not my real teacher,\u201d Jolene told him earnestly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking over until Mrs. Gough recovers from surgery,\u201d Rosie explained. \u201cThis is my first time back in the classroom after, uh, several years. I was recently\u2014divorced.\u201d The word nearly choked her. To Rosie\u2019s horror, tears filled her eyes and she had to turn away before she embarrassed them both.</p><p>Through sheer force of will, Rosie managed to hold on to her composure. While she talked to several other parents, Bruce lingered; Jolene showed him her desk and led him to the play area at the back of the room.</p><p>By eight o\u2019clock, just a few parents and children remained. Rosie carried the empty punch bowl and cookie plate to the cafeteria kitchen, and when she returned, Bruce and Jolene were the only two left.</p><p>\u201cIf Jolene needs extra help with her reading or spelling, please let me know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to,\u201d Rosie assured him. \u201cIt was nice meeting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d He reached for his little girl\u2019s hand, then hesitated. His gaze briefly sought hers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your divorce.\u201d</p><p>Rosie looked down and nodded. \u201cI...am, too.\u201d</p><p>He left after that, and not a moment too soon. Once again Rosie found herself blinking back tears.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this. To all outward appearances, Zach was having the time of his life. When Allison and Eddie were with him they cooked together; the three of them got along famously. It didn\u2019t work that way on the nights Rosie spent with her children. Allison and Eddie bickered incessantly and her teenage daughter challenged Rosie\u2019s authority at every turn. She\u2019d clearly taken Zach\u2019s side in the divorce.</p><p>Feet dragging, Rosie entered the small apartment she shared with Zach. He was with the children this evening, and she doubted Eddie had made a fuss at bedtime. Those bouts of temper were reserved for the nights Rosie spent with the children. Allison had probably volunteered to wash the dinner dishes. Rosie had given up asking her daughter to perform even the most routine household tasks. It just wasn\u2019t worth the argument.</p><p>Oh, yes, she was a real catch, Rosie thought wryly. She was a recent divorc\u00e9e with two rebellious children. It wouldn\u2019t be long before dozens of eager men lined up at the door, all eager to date her.</p><p>Yeah, sure!</p><p>Seven</p><p>As a Seattle police detective, Roy McAfee had always had a hard time letting go of a case, no matter how cold. That hadn\u2019t changed, although he was now retired and living in Cedar Cove, where he\u2019d become a private investigator. His dogged determination served him well in his new job. He liked his work, liked the diversity of cases that came across his desk. He was good at what he did, and he knew it. Roy had discovered through his years of police work that if he was patient enough and lucky, he eventually discovered what he needed to know. However, things didn\u2019t always turn out exactly the way he expected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The disappearance of Dan Sherman was a prime example of that.</p><p>Grace had come to him shortly after her husband had disappeared. She was a strong woman. In his experience as a private detective, Roy had been hired by several women looking for answers regarding their husbands\u2019 activities or whereabouts. Twice he\u2019d been asked to track down errant spouses. In one case, he\u2019d started the investigation on a missing husband and had only gotten a week into the search when his client told him to quit looking. She\u2019d claimed that in retrospect she was better off without the bastard. She didn\u2019t want to know where the hell he was. If he\u2019d taken off with another woman, as she suspected, then the other woman was welcome to him.</p><p>From the little bit he\u2019d learned about the missing husband, Roy figured his client had made a good choice.</p><p>It surprised him that Grace Sherman had contacted him again. Dan had been found, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and laid to rest. Roy assumed the case was closed. She had the answers she needed, but not necessarily the ones she wanted.</p> <p>He heard the outside door open and glanced at the small clock on the corner of his desk. Twenty-five after twelve. A minute later Corrie, his wife and business manager, stepped into his office.</p><p>\u201cGrace Sherman is here for her twelve-thirty appointment.\u201d</p><p>She ushered Grace into the room. Corrie\u2019s eyes met his, and she shrugged as though to say she was as much in the dark about this meeting as he was.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Roy said, gesturing to the upholstered chair across from his desk.</p><p>\u201cWould you care for a cup of coffee?\u201d Corrie asked.</p> <p>Grace declined, and Corrie left, closing the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Roy began. He leaned back in his chair and waited.</p><p>Grace held her purse in her lap, her hands nervously gripping the clasp. \u201cI came because I wasn\u2019t sure where else to turn,\u201d she said, gazing down at the floor. \u201cIt has to do with Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfinished business?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBefore he\u2014before he killed himself, he wrote me a letter. Sheriff Davis gave it to me.\u201d She opened her purse. \u201cThe letter has some...information and I don\u2019t know what to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t remember hearing anything about a letter. \u201cWhat kind of information?\u201d</p> <p>Grace reached inside her purse for the envelope and handed it across the desk to Roy. \u201cNo one else has read this. Not even my daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sheriff Davis?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cI...I think he might\u2019ve started reading it and then realized it was personal, and out of respect for Dan and me, he...\u201d She paused, then shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he read it or not. I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>Roy slid the letter out of the envelope. The writing in the first few lines was even and precise, as though Dan had carefully considered each word. Halfway down the second page the writing grew large, slanting downward. At the bottom, where Dan had signed his name, it was barely legible.</p><p>Roy turned back to the first page and began to read. Dan Sherman apologized to his wife for killing himself, and for the hell he\u2019d put her through during their marriage.</p><p>Then Dan relayed the details of an incident that had happened in Vietnam when he\u2019d walked into a village and killed a woman and her child. He\u2019d mowed them down with bullets, murdered them out of instinctive fear. In the desperation of a young man willing to do anything to get out of the war alive, he\u2019d killed innocents. Others had, too. How many had died in the village that day might never be known.</p><p>When he\u2019d finished, Roy looked up and discovered Grace staring into the distance. She was pale but seemed composed.</p><p>\u201cDan was never the same after he came back from the war,\u201d she said in a hoarse whisper. \u201cNow I know why.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was a long time ago,\u201d Roy said reassuringly. Regret tightened his chest. He\u2019d been a nineteen-year-old kid when he\u2019d arrived in Vietnam. Thankfully he\u2019d never been faced with the kind of situation Dan Sherman had found himself in.</p><p>Dan hadn\u2019t indicated the number of people killed, but it appeared to have been a free-for-all. \u201cThe shooting just never seemed to stop,\u201d he\u2019d written. He\u2019d lived with that guilt all these years. Sometime back, Roy remembered reading that as many Vietnam vets had died by their own hand in the years that followed as were lost in the war. The causes were varied, although plainly it was guilt that had driven Dan to such drastic action.</p><p>\u201cWas this incident ever reported?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cReported?\u201d Grace repeated. \u201cThat I wouldn\u2019t know, but I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. I...I don\u2019t know what should be done with this information.\u201d She studied him, clearly hoping he\u2019d offer a solution. He had none to give her.</p><p>\u201cShould I hand the letter over to the army brass and let them deal with it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, merely raising one shoulder in a shrug.</p><p>\u201cOr should I give it to Sheriff Davis and leave it up to him?\u201d Her voice rose in agitation. \u201cHere\u2019s an idea,\u201d she cried. \u201cMaybe I should put the letter away and pretend I never read it. Better yet, I should destroy it completely.\u201d</p><p>Roy understood her dilemma, and didn\u2019t envy her. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what to do, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan didn\u2019t want Maryellen or Kelly to know. They\u2019ve just buried their father. That was hard enough without asking them to deal with this, too.\u201d</p><p>Roy agreed, but unfortunately this was a decision Grace had to make on her own.</p><p>\u201cIt happened almost forty years ago. It was a horrible time in our country\u2019s history. We sacrificed fifty thousand men.... No one wants to uncover another My Lai.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say how many others were involved.\u201d Her voice was soft, and Roy had to strain to hear. \u201cI want to know what\u2019s happened to the other men in the patrol. How have they managed to live with what they did? Have their lives been a living hell, too?\u201d Her voice throbbed with emotion. \u201cDid they walk the floors at night the way my husband did? Have their souls been tormented?\u201d Her eyes held his. \u201cTell me what to do, Roy. You\u2019re the only one I can ask. You\u2019re the only one I trust enough to point me in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>Roy leaned toward her. He wished he could supply the answer, but he couldn\u2019t. From the dark circles under her eyes, he knew she\u2019d been tormented by the responsibility Dan had imposed on her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as though he couldn\u2019t deal with it any longer and he laid the problem at my feet.\u201d Her words confirmed his own feeling about the situation.</p><p>\u201cFor weeks\u2014ever since Dan was found\u2014I couldn\u2019t sleep. I thought it was because of...something else, and it was better for a while, but it\u2019s begun again. The insomnia.\u201d</p><p>So she was the one walking the floors now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been an easygoing sort of person, but lately...lately I\u2019ve been depressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to see a physician?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to tell a doctor? That my husband was a mass murderer who recently committed suicide? Oh, by the way, this murder happened thirty-six years ago and has the potential to tear our country apart all over again?\u201d</p><p>Roy sighed. She had a point. \u201cLike I said, Grace, I can\u2019t advise you what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I decide to destroy the letter? The only people who\u2019ll ever know what it said are you and me.\u201d She challenged him with a narrowed look.</p><p>\u201cThen so be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I came to hear.\u201d</p><p>He heard the desperation in her voice, but there was nothing more he could say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m paying you to help me figure out what I should do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to track down the other men?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Grace shrugged. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know where to start. Dan never spoke about his war experiences and he never mentioned who those other men were.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Roy wasn\u2019t so sure Grace did want the truth.</p><p>\u201cI could find that out for you.\u201d He had connections in the Department of Defense; it would be a simple matter of a phone call or two.</p><p>Grace hesitated, closing her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it and let you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Roy knew that Grace wanted an answer but not the one that would rip apart her own life\u2014or those of others. He\u2019d wait to hear from her.</p><p>The morning Katie turned six weeks old, Maryellen bathed her, the way she usually did. She watched joyfully as her daughter flung out her arms, splashing and cooing with unrestrained delight. Katie sent a spray of water toward her, hitting Maryellen in the face.</p><p>Katie smelled of baby lotion and shampoo as Maryellen dressed her in a soft pink sleeper. Six weeks ago, Maryellen\u2019s entire life had changed. Her daughter had given her purpose and such profound joy, it was all she could do not to close her eyes and thank God for this precious gift.</p><p>The doorbell rang, and Maryellen held Katie against her shoulder as she walked through the living room to answer it. The leaves on the oak tree were turning deep autumn shades and had started to litter the front lawn.</p><p>To her surprise Jon stood there, looking self-conscious. His eyes immediately went to Katie and a slow smile crossed his face.</p><p>\u201cI developed some new pictures,\u201d he announced. \u201cI realize this isn\u2019t my day to have Katie, but I wanted you to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense, you\u2019re welcome anytime.\u201d Maryellen had been overwhelmed by the number of pictures Jon had already taken of their daughter.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I was having withdrawal symptoms. I figured this was a good excuse to see my little girl.\u201d He held out a large envelope. \u201cTrade you?\u201d</p><p>He knew how much she loved his photographs. \u201cDeal,\u201d she said, giving him Katie and taking the envelope. While Maryellen sat on one end of the sofa and examined these latest pictures, Jon cooed at his daughter. It was difficult to pay attention to the photographs, drawn as she was to the sight of Jon with Katie. Letting him drive away with their daughter twice a week hadn\u2019t become any easier, but she could never doubt his love.</p><p>As she reviewed the pictures, one in particular caught her interest. It was taken the morning Maryellen had gone to his house. She\u2019d sat in the rocking chair in Katie\u2019s nursery, breastfeeding their daughter. Her back was to the window and light spilled in around her. The cheerfully painted wall blurred in the background and only Maryellen and Katie were clear and vivid. Somehow Jon had captured the tenderness and love Maryellen felt for her daughter. Her focus was entirely on Katie, her smile a private one, for their baby alone. It was a classic image of mother and child, reminding her of paintings by Botticelli and Rembrandt.</p><p>She recalled that he\u2019d had his camera with him that morning. She\u2019d clowned around for him and he\u2019d snapped picture after picture, but she hadn\u2019t expected anything like this.</p><p>\u201cI see you found it,\u201d he said, watching her as she studied the photograph.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do it?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cHow do you know the precise moment to catch a woman\u2019s heart?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He frowned as if he didn\u2019t understand the question. For that matter, Maryellen wasn\u2019t sure she understood it, either. She loved her daughter. Loved Katie so much that just the sight of her made Maryellen\u2019s heart stop beating for a second or two. That was the love Jon had revealed so perfectly on film.</p><p>\u201cI thought you didn\u2019t take photographs of people,\u201d she said. \u201cOther than Katie, of course.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t help remembering the picture in his bedroom....</p><p>\u201cOnly you.\u201d Jon kissed Katie on the forehead. \u201cIf it bothers you, I won\u2019t again.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t what she wanted, but then Maryellen no longer knew what was right or wrong as far as Jon was concerned. He made everything so much more complicated.</p> <p>\u201cI...love this picture, Jon. I really love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>To make matters worse, tears filled her eyes and she turned away as they ran down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d Her words, rash and illogical, escaped on a sob.</p><p>Jon stood and placed Katie in her bassinet. He paced back and forth a couple of times, then sat down next to Maryellen. She refused to face him as she tried to stem these ridiculous tears. Baby blues or not, she hated being out of control.</p><p>He touched her shoulder, so lightly she almost didn\u2019t feel it. \u201cCan you tell me why you\u2019re crying?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Slowly he ran his hand down the length of her arm.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you have to be so wonderful?\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>His hand paused. \u201cWould you rather I was unreasonable and short-tempered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve treated you terribly. I hid the fact that I was pregnant, tried to keep you out of our baby\u2019s life and all...all you\u2019ve been is patient and wonderful. I could hate you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate me?\u201d He turned her shoulders so she was forced to face him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, though. I thought I would, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the sides of her neck in a leisurely, hypnotic massage. Maryellen half closed her eyes and swayed toward him. Jon wove his fingers deep into her long hair and brought her mouth within a fraction of his own.</p><p>\u201cAfter the way I\u2019ve treated you, you should detest me,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, Maryellen,\u201d he whispered, and his breath mingled with hers.</p> <p>She parted her lips, anticipating his kiss. The tip of his tongue, moist and warm, outlined her mouth, and Maryellen moaned at the pure sensuality of it. Her lips parted further and Jon brushed his mouth against hers. His fingers tightened in her thick hair as he continued the kiss.</p><p>Maryellen tasted the salt of her tears and realized that she was weeping even as he kissed her. She heard him whisper, but couldn\u2019t make out the words. Whatever he was saying didn\u2019t seem nearly as important as what he was doing and what he was making her feel.</p><p>With her arms wrapped around him, she pressed against his hard, muscular strength. They were both panting, their shoulders heaving with the intensity of their desire.</p><p>A discordant sound made its way into her clouded mind. She groaned, not knowing where this lovemaking would take them, unwilling to stop. His hands cupped her breasts, and sensation bolted through her. With his mouth against hers, he unfastened her blouse and bra, and she felt his hands tremble as he eased his thumb over her swollen nipple. This latest invasion made her whimper as she tilted back her head.</p><p>The cry came again and Maryellen\u2019s eyes flew open. \u201cKatie,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s Katie.\u201d</p><p>Jon drew back. They momentarily leaned against each other, trying to regain their equilibrium.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014I almost forgot the baby,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jon laughed softly. \u201cWhat baby? Oh, you mean our baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very one.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen stood up to check on Katie, who was fussing in earnest now. She punched the air with her arms and feet and screamed as though the world were ending. Maryellen supposed that for a baby, feeding time was about that important.</p><p>As discreetly as possible, Maryellen fastened her bra and blouse. It occurred to her that this was a bit silly, since she\u2019d be unfastening them again in a minute. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ve warped her mind forever?\u201d she asked, hoping to make light of what had happened between them.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for Katie, but I know what you\u2019ve done to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you...uncomfortable?\u201d she asked, not knowing how to phrase the question any more delicately. Even when her intentions were good, she managed to hurt him\u2014to reject him, either physically or emotionally. She assumed there\u2019d been painful rejections in his past; all the signs were there. Her own life was colored with anguish he knew nothing about, distress that was impossible to share.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been uncomfortable, as you put it, since the first night we kissed.\u201d</p><p>She remembered that kiss. Halloween night a year ago. He\u2019d walked her to her car after a party during which she\u2019d introduced him to a friend. Her plan had been to foist him off on someone else in a pitiful attempt to get him out of her mind. That scheme had failed miserably, just like every other one she\u2019d plotted in their bewildering relationship.</p><p>\u201cI have to feed Katie,\u201d she told him. Her feet felt unsteady as she reached for her daughter and positioned the infant in the crook of her arm. She sat down in her rocker, unfastened shirt and bra, and gave the baby her breast. Katie\u2019s tiny mouth latched eagerly onto her nipple.</p><p>\u201cI take it this is my cue to leave,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>She nodded, unable to meet his gaze.</p><p>Jon stood only a few feet away. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the photos with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. She found it hard to believe that only moments earlier they\u2019d practically been rolling around on the floor, kissing and groping with abandon. She was embarrassed, somehow, by the juxtaposition of maternal and sexual feelings.</p><p>\u201cKeep the pictures you like for Katie\u2019s baby book and I\u2019ll get the rest on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you...I appreciate it.\u201d He\u2019d be back then, of course, to collect Katie. Her hold tightened around their daughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie and I will be here.\u201d She kept her eyes lowered.</p><p>She heard him walk over to the door. He opened it. \u201cMaryellen?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up and saw that his mouth was twitching with a barely suppressed smile. \u201cYou can hate me anytime you want.\u201d</p><p>Zach Cox looked down at his watch. It was one of his nights with Allison and Eddie, and he needed to leave the office precisely at five. Frustrated, he closed a file and set it aside. He\u2019d have to finish calculating the employment taxes for the Tulips and Things craft store tomorrow morning. Just as he was about to leave, Janice Lamond appeared in his doorway.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cox,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI was wondering if you had a moment to review the Jackson quarterly tax statement with me?\u201d Her look implored him.</p><p>It seemed she routinely required his help at closing time. Most nights Zach didn\u2019t have a problem checking her figures, but on the evenings he spent with the kids, he simply didn\u2019t have the extra minutes to spare.</p><p>\u201cCan it wait until morning?\u201d he asked as he stood.</p><p>Janice wore a short skirt. It rose up mid-thigh and exposed long, shapely legs. The skirt was too short and too tight. He\u2019d never really noticed the way Janice dressed until recently. He glanced outside his office and realized the other women employed by the accounting firm were far more conservative in their clothing.</p><p>\u201cOf course it can wait,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI forgot you\u2019re with your children tonight.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and reached for his briefcase.</p><p>\u201cHow is that arrangement working?\u201d Janice moved all the way inside his office.</p><p>\u201cAbout as well as can be expected.\u201d Actually it was about as inconvenient as could be imagined. Half the time he didn\u2019t know where he was sleeping\u2014the apartment or the house. A week ago he\u2019d arrived with clothes but no underwear. He now left a spare set in the trunk of his car. He didn\u2019t feel inclined to tell Janice any of this, however.</p><p>As he prepared to leave the office, he placed several business magazines he hadn\u2019t had time to read inside the leather case. Rosie had given him the briefcase for Christmas three years earlier and he\u2019d used it every day since. He rarely had time for reading anymore. No time for golf, either, or jogging or any of the activities he\u2019d once enjoyed.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep you, then,\u201d Janice said with obvious reluctance.</p><p>\u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d he said, and snapped his briefcase shut. \u201cI can look at those figures then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures?\u201d she repeated. \u201cOh, yes, I almost forgot.\u201d</p><p>He removed his suit jacket from the small closet and slipped his arms into the sleeves. Janice continued to linger. \u201cWas there anything else?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you sometimes get lonely?\u201d She fluttered her lashes and for some reason they reminded Zach of spiders.</p><p>\u201cLonely?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I did, after my divorce. It was such a hard time emotionally and I wanted you to know that I understand those feelings. If you ever need to talk to someone, I\u2019m a good listener.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d Zach had no intention of combining business with pleasure. He\u2019d made the mistake of letting the lines blur earlier. It had started out innocently\u2014she\u2019d joined him for lunch one day when Rosie had to cancel at the last moment. Later, when he realized how unreasonable Rosie had become, he\u2019d asked Janice to help him look for an apartment. He\u2019d hoped to shake up his wife, get her to recognize what she was doing. His attempt had failed, to say the least. Rosie had taken his leaving seriously and seemed more than happy to have him out of the house. Janice had found him an apartment, all right, and the lines had blurred even further when he\u2019d accepted a housewarming gift from her and taken her and her son to lunch.</p><p>Janice hesitated. \u201cI was thinking we could have dinner one night. My treat.\u201d</p><p>Dinner? Her treat? No way. \u201cI appreciate the invitation, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that we be seen together outside the office.\u201d He wasn\u2019t handing Rosie any ammunition or giving her one more excuse to toss accusations in his face. Unfortunately, living the way they did, moving in and out of the house, made confronting each other inevitable. Zach wasn\u2019t happy about it and he suspected Rosie wasn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cMaybe some other time,\u201d Janice said, sounding hopeful.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Zach agreed, but it wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>Rosie had claimed months earlier that Janice and Zach were having an affair. She was being ridiculous and had refused to believe him when he said they weren\u2019t. Now he was beginning to wonder if Janice had been chasing after him. He hated the thought that he\u2019d been played for a fool. If that was the case, then it was Rosie\u2019s doing. She was the one so ready to leap to conclusions, so eager to find fault with him\u2014so willing to abandon him to Janice\u2019s attentions. Rosie had acted like a jealous shrew when she had no reason. It irritated him whenever he thought about it. Not that he was blaming Janice for their divorce. His marriage had been ailing for a long time before his assistant appeared on the scene. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frowning as he walked out of the office, Zach refused to let his mind wander down the familiar paths of guilt and blame. His marriage was dead, and rehashing unresolved issues between him and Rosie would do no good.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Zach drove into the garage at 311 Pelican Court, the custom-built house he\u2019d helped design. Together he and Rosie had pored over house plans for months on end. Despite this inconvenient arrangement, he felt grateful to the judge for her unconventional edict, since it meant he didn\u2019t have to completely give up a place he loved.</p><p>To Zach\u2019s surprise, the house was quiet when he came in through the kitchen door.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d he called as he set his briefcase on the counter.</p> <p>\u201cHere, Dad,\u201d Eddie shouted from the family room. He was lying in front of the television on his stomach, manipulating the joystick to his video game. \u201cAllison\u2019s got a visitor in her bedroom,\u201d he said, looking up at Zach. \u201cIt\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The word exploded out of Zach before he could stop it. He\u2019d see about this. Allison knew the rules, and Rule Number One was no kids at the house without an adult present. No boys in her room, either. Ever.</p><p>Eddie nodded in the direction of the hallway. \u201cCheck it out.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t need a second invitation. He practically ran to Allison\u2019s bedroom; it was the fastest he\u2019d moved in weeks. He pounded on the closed door, then flung it open. His daughter sat on the edge of her bed with her arms entwined around the neck of a skinny boy with long stringy hair badly in need of washing. He wore a black leather jacket and motorcycle boots that laced up to his knees. A studded leather dog collar circled his neck.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d Allison\u2019s eyes grew huge. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI live here three days a week. Who\u2019s this?\u201d He narrowed his gaze on the pimply-faced youth.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ryan Wilson. Ryan, this is my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d Zach said. He reached for the boy\u2019s arm and jerked him to an upright position. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Without taking a breath, he continued. \u201cHowever, we have rules in this house and that includes no boys in my daughter\u2019s bedroom.\u201d He loomed over the teenager, who blinked up at him, face paling.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Allison cried.</p><p>Zach ignored her. \u201cIf you want to see my daughter again, I suggest you abide by my rules. Do we understand each other, Ryan?\u201d he asked pointedly.</p><p>Ryan nodded.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He held out his hand. \u201cWell, goodbye, Ryan. I assume you know your way to the front door?\u201d</p><p>Ryan made a beeline out of the bedroom.</p><p>Allison was on her feet now, too, her expression one of outrage. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I dare, Allison, and I\u2019ll dare a whole lot more. What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing bringing a boy into this house without an adult present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult.\u201d</p><p>Zach nearly laughed out loud. \u201cWhen you\u2019re living on your own, paying your own expenses, we\u2019ll revisit that issue. As it stands now, you live in my house.\u201d He paused, because technically this wasn\u2019t his house. It belonged to Rosie and him jointly and to the kids.</p><p>\u201cI can invite anyone I want into my room.\u201d</p><p>Zach glared at her. \u201cDon\u2019t go there, little girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLittle girl?\u201d Indignation shone from her eyes, and her cheeks reddened as she clenched her fists at her sides.</p><p>Zach could see this argument was getting out of hand. He was angry and so was Allison. Difficult as it was, they both needed to step back and take a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this after dinner.\u201d He turned and left the room, and heard the door slam a couple of seconds later.</p><p>By the time Zach entered the kitchen, he was shaking. He dragged several calming breaths into his lungs and forced his heart to settle down to a normal beat.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Eddie asked, following him inside.</p><p>\u201cHot dogs,\u201d Zach said. It was convenient, quick and he was in no mood to mess with a casserole. He\u2019d discovered he was quite good at tossing a few ingredients together. He had his failures\u2014notably the ground turkey baked with peas and rice\u2014and his successes. Eddie didn\u2019t seem to care one way or the other. Of the two, Allison was the picky eater.</p><p>\u201cWe had hot dogs last night.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Rosie to beat him to the punch. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Without hesitation, Eddie said, \u201cSpaghetti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He searched the refrigerator\u2019s freezer section for hamburger and realized there was none. It was his week to buy groceries, which he should\u2019ve done before he got home. More than likely, that was why Allison had Ryan in her room. She\u2019d expected him to arrive later than normal, but he\u2019d forgotten it was his turn to do the shopping.</p><p>\u201cHas Ryan been here before?\u201d he asked. He hated to use his son as a snitch, but he was beginning to think Ryan might be a routine visitor. If so, that was about to stop right now.</p><p>Eddie glanced over his shoulder and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cDoes your mother know?\u201d</p><p>Eddie shook his head. \u201cNo one did until now.\u201d</p><p>Zach patted his son on the back. \u201cWhat about macaroni and cheese?\u201d</p><p>Eddie shrugged. \u201cAre you going to cook the real kind or the kind that comes out of a box?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have?\u201d Zach asked, examining the contents of various cupboards. He needed something easy while he decided what to do about Allison. It was clear he\u2019d have to talk to her, and much as he dreaded the idea of calling Rosie, he should probably get her advice before he initiated the big discussion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got grated mozzarella cheese,\u201d Eddie said, peering inside the refrigerator. \u201cThat makes the best kind \u2019cause it melts in the macaroni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Eddie removed the container of cheese and set it on the counter. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to make me eat green beans with this, are you? Mom does. She\u2019s on this kick about eating vegetables and fresh fruit. It\u2019s disgusting. She won\u2019t let us order pizza, either.\u201d</p><p>Zach smiled wanly. \u201cI might let you off just this once.\u201d</p><p>Eddie looked appreciative.</p><p>\u201cI think I should call your mother,\u201d Zach said, putting a pot of water on the stove.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not home.\u201d</p><p>His son was a fount of information. \u201cShe isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Eddie beamed him a big smile. \u201cShe\u2019s got a date.\u201d</p><p>Rosie was out on a date? If so, he wanted to know who with. No one had said anything to him about this. \u201cOn a school night?\u201d he asked, hoping for more facts.</p><p>Eddie nodded. \u201cThat was all she talked about last night. Dad, I\u2019ve got problems with my math homework. Can you help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said absently. This was great. Just great! Zach was struggling to find something edible to feed his kids. He was the one dealing with his teenage daughter\u2019s rebellion. Eddie needed help with his homework. And his ex-wife was enjoying a night on the town with her new love interest.</p><p>There was definitely something wrong with this picture.</p><p>Eight</p><p>It was a lovely Saturday morning, and the blustery winds of October blew orange and yellow leaves around the waterfront and the Cedar Cove Farmers\u2019 Market. Grace and Olivia meandered down the row between a series of festive booths.</p><p>\u201cSo, what time do you want to go to the movie?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d pass this afternoon,\u201d Grace said nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d Olivia couldn\u2019t help being disappointed. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>Grace suddenly became flustered. \u201cOh, for heaven\u2019s sake, just go to the movie without me,\u201d she cried.</p><p>Olivia knew that look. Her friend was up to something and Olivia probably wasn\u2019t going to like it. She stopped at a booth and purchased a loaf of homemade raisin bread, which she tucked into her large straw bag.</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Grace said as though the truth had been tortured out of her.</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t bother to point out that she hadn\u2019t asked.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s going to be there.\u201d</p><p>That got Olivia\u2019s attention. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. Remember Jack? He called and asked me to set it up.\u201d</p><p>Now, this was downright ridiculous. Jack had phoned her best friend and not her?</p><p>\u201cRemember last month when you turned down Stan\u2019s dinner invitation?\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t likely to forget. It had caused a rift between her and Stan, but she wasn\u2019t nearly as concerned about her relationship with her ex-husband as she was about her continuing disagreement with Jack.</p><p>\u201cJack was supposed to meet us at the theater the Friday night we went to the movies last month, but at the last minute he couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Olivia demanded, although she wasn\u2019t really upset. It was increasingly obvious that she needed all the assistance she could get in the romance department. Not that her friend was any great expert. Grace had her own difficulties, but unfortunately they weren\u2019t the kind that intervention would help.</p><p>\u201cJack covers the Friday-night football games,\u201d Grace reminded her. \u201cGordie was supposed to go instead, but something came up.\u201d</p><p>They continued to stroll through the market, mouths watering at the enticing scent of popping kettle corn carried on the wind. \u201cJack wasn\u2019t happy about it.\u201d Grace sighed. \u201cEver since then, he\u2019s been driving me nuts, trying to get me to set up another movie outing, but between your schedule, his and mine\u2014well, it\u2019s getting too crazy to work it all out. I figured I\u2019d just tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time he and I settled this, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Olivia said, eager to patch up her differences with Jack. They\u2019d let their quarrel drag on weeks longer than it should have. She didn\u2019t understand why he hadn\u2019t simply called her, but...well, trust a man to do things the hard way.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Grace said emphatically. \u201cYou\u2019re both stubborn and headstrong. Now fix it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t believe her ears. This was Grace speaking? Grace never ordered people about. Obviously she felt strongly about this, and that made Olivia feel good.</p><p>Leaves billowed past and leaden gray clouds had begun to darken the sky. It would rain within the hour, she predicted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will he know which movie?\u201d Olivia hadn\u2019t even decided what she wanted to see.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s a smart man, he\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he was so smart, he\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, are you going to argue with me, or are you going to accept some heartfelt advice and do what I suggest?\u201d</p><p>Before she answered, Olivia had a question or two of her own. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with you and Cliff?\u201d</p><p>Grace sighed again. \u201cNot a whole lot. After Dan was found, I told him I needed time to grieve for my husband. He understood.\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded; that much she knew. \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen him in a while.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe talk every week. Cliff\u2019s been doing a lot of traveling lately and he\u2019s building a new barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is he expanding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019s serious about raising quarter horses and he\u2019s increasing his herd. When we spoke last Saturday, he said he\u2019s thinking of hiring a full-time hand.\u201d She began to say something else and stopped, obviously aware of her friend\u2019s ploy. She turned to stare Olivia in the eye. \u201cAre you going to the movies this afternoon or not?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugged one shoulder.</p> <p>Grace laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019re going, and judging by the smile on your face, you can hardly wait.\u201d</p><p>That was the truth. Olivia wasn\u2019t sure how Jack was supposed to know what showing she planned to attend or which movie, but as Grace had informed her, he\u2019d figure it out.</p><p>And Grace, it turned out, knew what she was talking about. No more than five minutes after Olivia had chosen her seat, munching popcorn and waiting for the movie to start, Jack Griffin entered the theater. He looked exactly the same as the last time she\u2019d seen him. He wore his long dark raincoat over beige slacks and a black turtleneck sweater. He walked past her down the aisle as if he hadn\u2019t seen her and took a seat three rows up, directly in front of her.</p><p>If he expected her to talk to him first, he had a lengthy wait ahead of him. Then, as though he\u2019d forgotten something, he stood and marched toward the door. He was two steps up the aisle when he did a double-take, as if he\u2019d just noticed her.</p><p>\u201cAs I live and breathe, it\u2019s Judge Lockhart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack Griffin, this is a pleasant surprise.\u201d She played along, flushing with pleasure. It was so damned good to see her friend again, and the instant she did, she realized how much she\u2019d missed him. Even more than she\u2019d thought...</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you to a movie all alone in the middle of a Saturday afternoon?\u201d he asked\u2014as if he didn\u2019t already know.</p><p>It was time for the truth. No more games, just the truth. \u201cYou haven\u2019t figured it out?\u201d She grinned sheepishly up at him. \u201cI came because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He gave an award-winning look of surprise.</p><p>\u201cGrace told me you were going to be here,\u201d Olivia confessed.</p><p>Jack snorted. \u201cShe told me you\u2019d be here, too.\u201d</p> <p>The theater darkened and Jack moved toward her row. \u201cDo you mind if I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you would.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to be invited twice, nearly leaping over her in his eagerness to get into the adjacent seat. As soon as he was settled, he tried to help himself to a handful of her popcorn.</p><p>Olivia playfully slapped his wrist. \u201cKindly wait until I offer.\u201d</p><p>Jack sent her a hurt look, and when she slanted the bucket in his direction, he dug right in. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly eat all this by yourself, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>He snickered softly. \u201cAre you always this bossy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and if you haven\u2019t figured that out by now, you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre there makeup classes?\u201d he asked, as he scooted down in his seat.</p><p>Olivia smiled. \u201cThat can be arranged.\u201d</p><p>Jack reached for another handful of popcorn. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>Her throat tightened. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too.\u201d</p><p>The woman sitting in front of them and off to one side twisted around. Her lips were pursed in annoyance. \u201cI hate to interrupt your reunion, but I\u2019d like to hear the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Olivia whispered, mortified that someone had to shush her in the theater. She hoped the lights were too dim for anyone to recognize her.</p><p>Jack straightened and leaned across the back of the seat closest to the woman who\u2019d complained. \u201cIt\u2019s actually all Olivia\u2019s fault,\u201d he said conversationally. \u201cYou see, it\u2019s been four months since we\u2019ve seen each other and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Olivia tugged at the sleeve of his raincoat. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary that she hear the details of our misunderstanding.\u201d</p><p>He continued chatting as if this woman was his long-lost friend. Olivia sank down as far in the seat as she could.</p><p>After several minutes, just as the previews finished, Jack turned around again. \u201cMarion, this is Olivia. Olivia, Marion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d Olivia lifted one hand in greeting and offered the woman a half smile.</p><p>Marion cheerfully waved back. \u201cI\u2019m just so glad you two are together again and that your dear, dear friend lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Surely Olivia had misunderstood something.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy the movie,\u201d Jack said as he shifted back in his seat.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Olivia asked, although she already knew. Jack had told another of his outrageous stories; he should\u2019ve been writing fiction, not newspaper columns. She poked him in the ribs with her elbow when he chose to ignore her.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d Jack said, staring at the screen. He glanced away long enough to scoop up more popcorn.</p><p>Olivia relaxed, and after a few moments released a pent-up sigh. It felt so good to have him back in her life. They hadn\u2019t settled anything, hadn\u2019t discussed any of the once-important issues. And Olivia wasn\u2019t even sure that was necessary.</p><p>She was so caught up in her thoughts, she didn\u2019t notice that Jack had taken the entire bucket of popcorn\u2014until she tried to get some.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t eat any more,\u201d he asserted.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you won\u2019t be hungry when I take you out to dinner after the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That answered that, but didn\u2019t explain why he continued to eat, munching down as if he hadn\u2019t had a decent meal in weeks. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m always hungry.\u201d</p><p>Olivia rested her head on his shoulder and Jack put the bucket down and slid his arm around her. Like high school sweethearts, they leaned their heads against each other, holding hands. Olivia hadn\u2019t felt this contented in months.</p><p>She had no idea what the movie was about.</p><p>Sunday morning, Rosie was awakened by the sound of rain beating incessantly against the apartment window. She closed her eyes and tried to go back to sleep, without success. She was awake. Wide awake. It\u2019d taken her hours to fall asleep, and now this.</p><p>Weekends were the worst for her. During the week, she was in the classroom every day, and the whole issue of the divorce and this ridiculous joint custody arrangement was easy enough to shove aside. But weekends were dreadful. She hated that Zach was at the house on Friday and Saturday nights. When she\u2019d agreed to give him weekends, she\u2019d thought it was poetic justice. With the children constantly underfoot, he wouldn\u2019t be able to date much. If he realized her intention, he didn\u2019t let on, but it gave Rosie a sense of satisfaction to thwart him at every turn, especially when it came to his relationship with Janice Lamond.</p><p>Wearing her thin housecoat, Rosie wandered into the kitchen and started a pot of coffee. She wasn\u2019t scheduled to be back at the house until five that afternoon. What they were doing made no sense\u2014the way they were living, moving in and out of the house every few days. She couldn\u2019t imagine what that judge was thinking.</p><p>The rain continued and a chill raced up her arms. The housecoat she wore now was a summer one, inadequate to protect her against the chill of these autumn mornings. This was crazy! One set of clothes hung in her closet here and another at the house. Half the time she didn\u2019t know what was where.</p><p>The morning stretched before her, empty and bleak. A year earlier, she\u2019d been so busy with her volunteer work that she couldn\u2019t squeeze in time to cook her family dinner. Her charity work, along with so much else, had gone by the wayside with the divorce. She\u2019d been forced to resign from every volunteer position\u2014positions she\u2019d willingly accepted. She wasn\u2019t even missed. All her responsibilities, which were once so important, had been transferred to other people. Now she moved from school to school. Her days were filled with teaching, and when she wasn\u2019t with the children, her nights were lonely. Her entire life had changed at the sound of a judge\u2019s gavel.</p><p>Her friends, most of whom were married, no longer seemed to have time for her. A year ago, Rosie had people to see, appointments every day, plans every night. Now there was nothing but guilt and doubts and an abundance of pain.</p><p>When she finished her coffee, Rosie showered, then read the weekend editions of the Bremerton Sun and the local paper, but few of the articles held her interest. The Cedar Cove Chronicle had a brief piece about the mysterious man who\u2019d turned up dead at the Thyme and Tide, but there didn\u2019t seem to be any additional details. Closing her eyes, she tried to remember what it had been like before...before their marital troubles. Before the divorce.</p><p>Sunday mornings had always been hectic, getting everyone ready for church and out the door in time for worship service. Until recently, she\u2019d sung in the choir, but she\u2019d stopped attending church once she filed for divorce. She was afraid of facing her friends and having to confess what a lie she\u2019d been living.</p><p>If she missed church services so badly, then perhaps she should go back. Not to the same church, of course, but someplace new, where she could make a fresh start. She\u2019d been hearing good things about the pastor at the Methodist church, Dave Flemming, if she remembered his name correctly. Maybe she should think about attending there. It just might help her deal with the upheaval in her life. God knew she needed something...and fast.</p><p>Decision made, Rosie quickly checked the telephone book for the times of the worship services and realized that if she left right away, she\u2019d make the one scheduled for nine o\u2019clock.</p><p>The parking lot was nearly full when she arrived. She saw several people she knew, including Bob and Peggy Beldon from the bed-and-breakfast, and a number of parents she\u2019d met at the Open House. Seeing Bruce Peyton and his daughter might have cheered her up, but apparently they attended elsewhere. She liked Bruce and they\u2019d talked a couple of times, meeting for dinner once when Jolene was asleep and watched over by a neighbor. Their pain was a common bond\u2014perhaps their only bond.</p><p>The music had already started when Rosie slipped into a pew near the back of the church. Gone were the days when she proudly marched up the center aisle with her husband and children. Like so much else, her respectability had vanished with the divorce.</p><p>The music was wonderful, and even in her depressed state, it lifted her spirits. She listened carefully to the sermon, but about halfway through the service she felt someone\u2019s eyes on her. Hoping she wasn\u2019t being obvious, she looked over her shoulder and immediately froze.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be! Of all the coincidences in this world, why here? Why now?</p><p>Two rows behind her sat Zach and Eddie. There must be fifteen churches in Cedar Cove, and she and Zach just happened to choose the same one on the same Sunday. Rosie wanted to groan with frustration. No place was safe for her. She couldn\u2019t even walk into church and not be reminded of her past.</p><p>When the service ended, Zach waited for her outside the building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t follow you here if that\u2019s what you think,\u201d he told her, his voice defensive.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t follow you, either. Listen, Zach, we\u2019re divorced. You have your life and I have mine. This is the first time I\u2019ve attended this church, and I can easily go elsewhere. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom. Hi, Dad,\u201d Eddie said, racing up to join his parents. \u201cMy friend Joel comes here. He invited me to his house for lunch. I can go, can\u2019t I, Dad?\u201d He looked expectantly toward Zach and then Rosie. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Seeing that Eddie was under his father\u2019s jurisdiction until five, she left the decision to him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll need their address and phone number,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cYou want to meet his parents?\u201d Eddie asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll be there in just a minute. I want to talk to your mother first.\u201d</p><p>Eddie gave him a bright smile. \u201cOkay.\u201d With that, the nine-year-old tore across the parking lot, where a small group of parents and children had gathered.</p><p>As if reading her mind, Zach said, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s home before you get there.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cAs I was saying about this morning\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Zach interrupted. \u201cThis was our first Sunday here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll change churches. It looks like Eddie\u2019s already got a friend here.\u201d Allison, however, was nowhere to be seen. \u201cWhere\u2019s Allison?\u201d Rosie looked around, thinking their daughter was probably with her friends, as well. When they\u2019d attended church as a family, Allison made a habit of sitting in any pew her family wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>Now Rosie was getting irritated. Allison had been in a horrible mood ever since Zach had kicked her boyfriend out of her bedroom. \u201cYou let her stay home?\u201d</p><p>Zach wore a guilty look. \u201cShe refused to come, and I figured forcing her would only make matters worse.\u201d Zach didn\u2019t seem any too pleased about it, either. From the way he stiffened, he obviously expected Rosie to chastise him.</p> <p>Actually, she was pleased Zach had to deal with their daughter\u2019s temper for once. \u201cAre you still having problems with Allison?\u201d she asked, hoping he\u2019d admit it.</p><p>\u201cSome. What about you?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should get together and discuss what\u2019s happening with her,\u201d Zach suggested, surprising Rosie.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever it\u2019s convenient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more than her bringing Ryan into her bedroom?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I think it\u2019s important that the two of us communicate regularly.\u201d</p> <p>Rosie agreed, although with some reluctance. The sooner they got this over with, the better, she decided. \u201cHow about now?\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Zach and Rosie sat across from each other at the Pancake Palace. Eddie was with his friend Joel, and Zach would be picking him up later.</p><p>Since the two of them were taking up a table and the place was busy with the Sunday breakfast crowd, Rosie felt obliged to order something more than coffee.</p><p>When the waitress came, she asked for coffee, two eggs and toast, plus a separate bill. Zach ordered the same thing and also asked for his own check. Once it was understood that they\u2019d each pay for breakfast, Zach turned his attention back to Rosie.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know about Ryan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. His parents are divorced and he lives with his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lets him pierce various body parts,\u201d Zach said, frowning.</p><p>Rosie wasn\u2019t impressed with that, either. \u201cApparently so.\u201d There were six safety pins clipped through Ryan\u2019s ear, and a small steel ball was attached to the end of his tongue. The thought of this boy kissing their daughter made her queasy.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been over to the house since I talked to him,\u201d Zach added with some satisfaction.</p><p>Rosie wasn\u2019t convinced that was true, but didn\u2019t want to say anything that would threaten their fragile peace.</p><p>\u201cI talked to his mother last week.\u201d</p><p>That piqued Zach\u2019s interest. \u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d</p><p>From their brief conversation, it seemed Ryan\u2019s mother didn\u2019t exactly see the situation in the same light as Rosie did. \u201cShe...was defensive. I told her we preferred that an adult be in the house if Ryan visited. She accused me of being overprotective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it any of her business?\u201d Zach demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a lot of cooperation from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems that way.\u201d Zach was frowning.</p><p>Rosie was so grateful to talk to him about this. It dawned on her now why she\u2019d been so restless and uneasy\u2014it was largely due to her daughter\u2019s behavior.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember last year when I told you about the Harrison girl?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Zach shook his head.</p><p>\u201cShe was in junior high and pregnant with twins.\u201d</p><p>The color seemed to rush from Zach\u2019s face. \u201cYou don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d He couldn\u2019t bring himself to say it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Zach, and we might not know for sure until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Her words had the shock value she\u2019d intended. Allison\u2019s anger and resentment grew more acute every week. This boy in her life was trouble, and their daughter\u2019s future could well be at stake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about Allison,\u201d Zach said, his voice low.</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Rosie agreed. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take the divorce well, and she\u2019s lashing out at both of us. I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019d do.... I hardly know her anymore.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Olivia was happy. She woke early on Sunday morning\u2014her birthday\u2014and luxuriated in bed while the last dregs of sleep left her. It occurred to her that she should be adding up the years, which now totaled a rather shocking number. Better yet, she should review her accomplishments and align them with her goals, which was what she did every birthday.</p><p>Yes, she should probably be doing that. Birthdays were a good opportunity to assess one\u2019s life. Instead, she was grinning to herself and mulling over the way she\u2019d \u201crun into\u201d Jack at the theater, all the silly subterfuge they\u2019d indulged in. But they\u2019d had such a good time together. Jack possessed the ability to make her laugh, and she valued that, more than almost anything. All pretense between them was gone now. It was clear how genuinely glad he\u2019d been to see her again, and the truth was, she felt equally delighted.</p><p>They\u2019d spent all afternoon together and all evening. After the movie, they\u2019d had dinner at the Taco Shack and lingered for hours over coffee, talking about every subject except one. Stan. He didn\u2019t ask, and Olivia certainly didn\u2019t bring her ex-husband\u2019s name into the conversation. It was as though neither of them wanted to say or do anything that might set back their relationship.</p><p>They parted reluctantly and talked for another thirty minutes in the parking lot.</p><p>Even though Jack had bought her a birthday gift the year before, she was sure he\u2019d forgotten the date. She could\u2019ve mentioned it, probably should have. Another should...but she had no intention of informing him that she was about to turn a whole year older.</p><p>Charlotte insisted on cooking her breakfast, so after church services, Olivia went to her mother\u2019s place.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d Charlotte called from the kitchen when Olivia let herself in the house. Harry, her guard cat, sprawled in the front window, basking in the autumn sunshine. The scent of cinnamon rolls fresh from the oven made Olivia\u2019s mouth water.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, sweetheart,\u201d her mother said warmly, coming out of the kitchen wearing an apron. She enveloped Olivia in a tight hug. \u201cYou look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Olivia wasn\u2019t ready to admit that Jack was responsible for the sparkle in her eyes. Not when her mother was guaranteed to give her a hearty \u201cI told you so\u201d in return.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s ready,\u201d Charlotte said. The dining table was set with her mother\u2019s best china, the orange juice poured in tall crystal goblets. Humming something Olivia didn\u2019t recognize, Charlotte bustled back to the kitchen. Come to think of it, her mother seemed to be in a mighty cheerful mood herself.</p><p>\u201cCan I help?\u201d Olivia asked, following her.</p><p>\u201cAll I need to do is bring everything to the table,\u201d Charlotte assured her. \u201cI baked your favorite breakfast casserole and cinnamon rolls.\u201d</p><p>Olivia swallowed a smile. The breakfast casserole was her mother\u2019s favorite, but far be it from Charlotte to cook it just for herself, so she always took advantage of a convenient excuse\u2014like her daughter\u2019s birthday.</p><p>\u201cThis looks so good.\u201d Olivia pulled out the chair across from her and surveyed the feast.</p><p>They bowed their heads and her mother said grace before she served the casserole, made up of bacon, onions, hash browns and lots of cheese. \u201cShall I tell you about the day you were born?\u201d Charlotte asked.</p><p>\u201cMother, I\u2019m fifty-five years old! I\u2019ve heard the story for fifty-four of those years. I know everything there is to know about that day.\u201d Every minute detail had been conveyed countless times. \u201cI know how Daddy had to rush you to the hospital at nine in the evening and how you were in labor for twenty hours. I know there was a big storm the very next day and nobody could visit until the day after. And I know I screamed for three solid hours\u2014or so you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth.\u201d Charlotte nodded stubbornly.</p><p>Olivia laughed. As silly as it was, she found herself passing on this tradition of her mother\u2019s to her own children. On the morning of her son James\u2019s last birthday, Olivia had phoned long distance to describe the day he was born. James had listened politely and then informed her she\u2019d told him the same thing, almost word for word, the year before.</p><p>Through breakfast, they chatted about family and friends and then her mother casually said, \u201cI invited Ben Rhodes to join us, but he had other plans this morning.\u201d</p><p>Ben, Olivia mused. She vaguely remembered hearing her mother mention Ben. It might seem peculiar that Charlotte would want to include a stranger in Olivia\u2019s birthday breakfast. But her mother was like that. She collected people the way some women collected china cups or brooches. For instance, Tom Harding, Cliff\u2019s grandfather, a man in his nineties.</p><p>She\u2019d befriended him a couple of years back. The old man had been a stroke victim and had lost the ability to speak, but he didn\u2019t appear to have any problem communicating with her mother. It was Charlotte\u2019s gift, Olivia decided, to seek out those who needed her attention most.</p><p>\u201cJustine and Seth invited me over for dinner,\u201d she said, purposely turning the subject away from her mother\u2019s latest charity project.</p><p>\u201cSo I heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Grace and I are taking the ferry to Seattle to have lunch on the waterfront next weekend.\u201d</p><p>Her mother nodded, but seemed a bit hurt at Olivia\u2019s decided lack of interest in her new friend. \u201cBen\u2019s stopping by later and we\u2019re going to visit the pumpkin patch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia considered it a bit odd that two elderly people would want to do something traditionally reserved for young families, but she didn\u2019t say anything. More than likely, her mother\u2019s friend was senile and had reverted to childhood memories and this was an activity he\u2019d enjoy.</p><p>\u201cHave a wonderful time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, we intend to,\u201d Charlotte murmured.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t know better, Olivia would\u2019ve thought she\u2019d seen her mother blushing.</p> <p>Later the same day, she asked her daughter about it. \u201cHave you noticed anything different about your grandmother lately?\u201d</p><p>Justine, who was busy stirring gravy, glanced up. \u201cGrandma? What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>Olivia held her infant grandson and paced the small kitchen, gently patting his back. Leif cooed at her, and for a moment, she was caught up in the sheer wonder of holding this baby close to her heart. When she realized Justine was waiting for her answer, she returned to the subject of her mother. \u201cOh\u2014we had breakfast this morning and, well, your grandmother seemed...oh, I don\u2019t know, secretive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecretive? How?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cMom, I\u2019ve been so busy with the restaurant and with Leif that I haven\u2019t had a chance to notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m sure, but after last year\u2019s cancer scare I want to keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too. It\u2019s just that I have so much going on right now.\u201d Justine, always responsible, was far too willing to accept blame for her shortcomings, imagined or real.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s not your job to be your grandmother\u2019s guardian. Just pay attention when you do see her and we\u2019ll compare notes.\u201d</p><p>Justine removed the pan from the stove top and poured the contents into a gravy boat just as the doorbell chimed. Seth, who\u2019d been putting the finishing touches on the table, answered it.</p><p>Stan stood in the doorway, holding a bouquet of flowers and a bottle of wine. \u201cI\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d he asked as he breezed into the small house. \u201cHappy birthday, Olivia,\u201d he said, kissing her on the cheek.</p> <p>\u201cDad?\u201d From Justine\u2019s blank look, Olivia could tell that Stan\u2019s visit was a surprise to her daughter, too.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d crash the birthday party. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d He smiled at Justine and Olivia.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Justine said, recovering first. Seth quickly added another place setting.</p><p>\u201cHello, Stan.\u201d Olivia\u2019s response was polite and cool. She hadn\u2019t talked to him since his less-than-subtle invitation to dinner in Seattle\u2014dinner that included a night in a hotel room.</p><p>Justine took the flowers and arranged them artfully in a vase, which she set in the middle of the table. With Leif asleep, Olivia settled her grandson in his crib and joined everyone at the table.</p><p>Dinner\u2014roast chicken and gravy, roasted root vegetables and salad\u2014was wonderful, although Olivia felt slightly on edge. That passed, however, as the meal progressed. Perhaps the wine relaxed her. Whatever it was, she was soon laughing and joking with her family and it seemed...so natural. She could almost believe that she and Stan had never been divorced. Stan was his warm, ingratiating self. Funny, witty, clever in ways that Olivia had all but forgotten.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Stan said as Seth and Justine went into the kitchen to prepare coffee. \u201cAre you going to forgive me?\u201d</p><p>Olivia saw no point in pretending she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive.\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cI was a little too pushy, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour problem is that you need a woman who adores you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and saluted her with his empty wineglass. \u201cYou once did, and I\u2019m hoping you will again. I adore you, you know.\u201d</p><p>It flattered her to hear it, but Olivia was older and wiser these days. She\u2019d once loved Stan with all of her being, but their marriage hadn\u2019t survived the loss of their son. The divorce had battered her emotionally, and it had taken her years to recover. Even now, she couldn\u2019t reflect on the summer of 1986 without sadness.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong,\u201d Stan said, lowering his voice. \u201cI want to make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>Make it up to her? Olivia nearly laughed but held on to her composure. \u201cThere are other women for you out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re interested in that...that newspaper guy. Olivia, no! Anyone can see Griffin\u2019s all wrong for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m the best judge of that.\u201d</p><p>Stan sat back in his chair and crossed his arms. Slowly he shook his head, intimating that he just couldn\u2019t imagine her with Jack. \u201cHe\u2019s a loose cannon,\u201d Stan muttered. \u201cYou realize that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia disagreed, but she had no intention of arguing with Stan over her relationship with another man. So she said nothing. Thankfully Seth and Justine returned with the coffee and birthday cake, and the matter was dropped.</p><p>Later that evening, when she got home after a full day of celebrating, she discovered two messages on her machine. One was from James and Selina, his wife, who\u2019d phoned with birthday greetings. The second message was from Jack.</p><p>Olivia returned his call first. He answered immediately, as though he\u2019d been sitting by the phone waiting for her. It was a pleasant thought.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, and he sounded thrilled to hear from her. \u201cWhere were you all day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know. I called six times and drove by once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you. I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019s proper etiquette to tell you that, but I did.... I still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He groaned the words. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you must know, it\u2019s my birthday, and I was at dinner with Justine and Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour birthday! Damn, Olivia, I forgot. You\u2019ll forgive me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t ask me how old I am.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnybody else there?\u201d The question was a blatant request regarding her ex-husband.</p><p>Olivia had the option of lying and avoiding any chance of another dragged-out misunderstanding. She hated to risk upsetting him just when they\u2019d reconciled, but she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t deceive him. \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted reluctantly. \u201cStan showed up. Unexpectedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBearing gifts, no doubt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as pretty as the ones you sent a while back.\u201d Olivia had left Stan\u2019s bouquet with her daughter.</p><p>\u201cCandy, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo candy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine,\u201d she confirmed.</p><p>He growled something under his breath. \u201cYou still want me to put on a pair of boxing gloves and fight him?\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. \u201cI never wanted you to get into a fistfight,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted you to prove you cared about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cShould I call him or do you want to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall Stan?\u201d Jack wasn\u2019t making any sense.</p><p>\u201cI think we should duke it out, just the two of us. Man to man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin, that\u2019s ridiculous! Tell me you\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>He paused, and she thought she could hear him shadowboxing in the background. He was definitely moving around.</p><p>\u201cYou could simply declare me the winner,\u201d Jack suggested hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI could,\u201d she agreed, \u201cbut first you\u2019d have to win my favor.\u201d</p><p>Jack groaned again. \u201cAnd exactly how am I supposed to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d She feigned surprise.</p><p>\u201cApparently not, but I\u2019ll study on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do that.\u201d Olivia gave a full-throated laugh. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes, it was good to have him back in her life.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Maryellen was going back to work. She dropped her ten-week-old daughter off at her sister\u2019s on Monday morning, the last week of October. She\u2019d resumed a nine-to-five schedule at the gallery.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kelly assured her, as Maryellen lingered anxiously at the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll phone if there\u2019s a problem?\u201d Leaving her daughter was harder than Maryellen had dreamed possible. It was difficult enough to let Jon take Katie for his regular visitation. She\u2019d assumed that leaving Katie with her own sister would be easier than this. Tears filled her eyes at the prospect of being away from her baby for more than eight hours a day.</p><p>\u201cEvery new mother goes through this,\u201d Kelly assured her. \u201cIt\u2019s hard leaving our babies, even when we know they\u2019re getting the best care in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe usually needs to be fed around ten,\u201d Maryellen said, although she\u2019d gone over Katie\u2019s schedule twice already. She\u2019d expressed the milk earlier and had filled several bottles.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. Now, get out of here before you\u2019re late for work.\u201d</p><p>Her sister was right, but still Maryellen hovered there in the doorway. Then, before she could change her mind about the whole thing, she turned and hurried to her car. Within a few days, dropping the baby off would become part of her daily routine. She\u2019d considered bringing Katie to the gallery with her, but an infant would be distracting. While not openly forbidding it, the owners had been discouraging.</p><p>She hated being away from her baby for a large part of every day, hated the sick sensation it left in the pit of her stomach. Doubts haunted her, fears that she was a bad mother. She couldn\u2019t help feeling that while Kelly was Katie\u2019s aunt, she couldn\u2019t possibly love her as much as Maryellen did. Despite her regrets, she knew this was necessary, and she had to face these demons sooner or later.</p><p>By ten that morning, Maryellen had phoned her sister no less than three times. Katie had slept for most of the morning, just as she normally did. During her last phone call, Kelly had told her she was warming Katie\u2019s bottle and would be feeding her right on schedule. Maryellen trusted her sister, but she worried that Kelly might not hold the baby the same way Maryellen did. Worried that the strange environment might disrupt her routine. Worried that Katie would intuitively know she wasn\u2019t in her own home, her own bed.</p><p>The bell chimed above the gallery door just as Maryellen replaced the receiver. Taking a moment to calm her pounding heart, she made an effort to look friendly and professional. As she stepped into the gallery\u2019s main room to meet her first customer of the day, she managed to smile.</p><p>Her business facade crumbled the instant she saw it was Jon. She was so pleased to see him, so glad to have someone to talk to about Katie.</p><p>He took one look at her and frowned. \u201cI thought so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought what?\u201d Her hackles immediately rose. Her pleasure at seeing him vanished. The last thing she needed was a lecture.</p><p>\u201cI figured I should check up on you your first day back to work. It was hard to leave Katie, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wanted to pretend he\u2019d completely misread her, but she wasn\u2019t sure she could pull it off. She found it increasingly difficult to disguise her feelings from Jon. Before Katie, she\u2019d been adept at fooling her mother and sister about her thoughts and emotions. But Jon had the innate ability to see straight through her.</p><p>\u201cIt was awful,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cDid she put up a fuss?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen shook her head, and to her horror, tears sprang to her eyes. This was mortifying.</p> <p>With his hand at her elbow, Jon led her to the back room. Turning her so she faced him, he placed his hands on her shoulders. \u201cKatie will be perfectly fine with your sister.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I hate not being with her.\u201d</p><p>Jon expelled a sigh, and slowly, as if against his will, he drew Maryellen into his embrace. \u201cI know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you possibly know?\u201d she challenged, needing his comfort and yet resenting the fact that she did. She closed her eyes and welcomed the feel of his arms, savored his warmth, his masculine scent. She didn\u2019t want him to realize how weak his nearness made her. The only way she could combat these feelings was to react defensively.</p><p>\u201cI know, Maryellen,\u201d he said evenly, \u201cbecause every week I have to leave my daughter with you and then walk away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d It couldn\u2019t possibly be this hard on him, she reasoned. He couldn\u2019t suffer the same regrets and doubts she did. Could he?</p><p>\u201cI...I must be a terrible mother.\u201d Being this close to Jon was intoxicating; there was no other word for it. She needed to escape that intoxication, to ease away from him, and she needed to do it now.</p><p>This emotional hold was exactly what she\u2019d been afraid of ever since the day they\u2019d kissed. He made it far too easy to rely on him. If she didn\u2019t break away now, he\u2019d become a permanent part of her life. And that was something she couldn\u2019t risk. That wasn\u2019t part of the deal. He was Katie\u2019s father\u2014not Maryellen\u2019s husband.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bad mother, you\u2019re just a new mother,\u201d Jon told her confidently. \u201cYou have a lot to learn. We both do.\u201d He stroked her hair with such tenderness that she could hardly move out of his arms.</p><p>With a wrenching effort, she put some distance between them. Crossing her arms, she leaned her hip against the desk. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p> <p>Not making eye contact, she gave a slight nod. \u201cI...it\u2019s just the first day. It\u2019s bound to be the most difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the books say.\u201d</p><p>She managed a weak smile. \u201cIt was...thoughtful of you to stop by.\u201d</p><p>Jon slipped his hands in his pockets. He did that, she\u2019d noticed, whenever he was unsure of himself. She sensed that he didn\u2019t want to be here and at the same time couldn\u2019t stay away. She understood perfectly. She\u2019d prefer to keep Jon out of her life\u2014she couldn\u2019t keep him out of Katie\u2019s\u2014but he was there. And wonderful. The day Katie was born, they\u2019d formed a bond, as parents and as friends, and neither of them knew how to deal with emotions beyond that. Kissing him a few weeks ago had only complicated matters.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on your way to work?\u201d she asked, eager now for him to go.</p><p>Jon took the hint. \u201cYeah. I should be off.\u201d</p><p>They both seemed to relax at that. \u201cWell, thank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>He headed for the door, then abruptly, without warning, turned back. He grasped her by the shoulders and kissed her. A quick, urgent kiss.</p> <p>The bell chimed as he walked out. Something had to be done and quickly. Jon was becoming far too important to her.</p><p>Wednesday night, both Allison and Eddie were in their bedrooms doing homework, or so Rosie assumed. There was nothing she could stand to watch on television, so she threw a load of wash in the machine. She preferred to do her laundry at the house. The washer in the apartment was at least twenty years old and had already ruined one good blouse. With money so tight, she didn\u2019t want to risk destroying any more of her limited professional wardrobe.</p><p>The phone rang, but Rosie knew better than to answer it. Allison considered it her right to grab all calls. Not only that, she couldn\u2019t let the phone go unanswered, as Rosie was often inclined to do these days, especially in the evenings.</p><p>Five seconds after the first ring, her daughter stuck her head out the bedroom door. \u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she said in an incredulous tone. \u201cIt\u2019s Dad.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful! Rosie could only imagine what Zach had to complain about this time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be long,\u201d Allison said tartly. \u201cI\u2019m expecting a call.\u201d</p><p>This was a less-than-subtle reminder that the eccentric judge who\u2019d set up this joint custody arrangement had more or less awarded the house to Allison and Eddie. So the phone belonged to the children\u2014or that was the way Allison seemed to look at it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine we\u2019ll talk long,\u201d Rosie assured her.</p><p>Allison closed her bedroom door without comment.</p><p>Rosie took the call in the kitchen, thinking this was the room where they were least likely to be overheard. She took a deep breath before lifting the receiver. \u201cHello,\u201d she said cheerfully. She wanted to give the impression that she\u2019d been having the time of her life and his call was an interruption.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Zach,\u201d he said stiffly. \u201cI thought you\u2019d want to know your boyfriend phoned.\u201d</p><p>Her boyfriend? It was news to Rosie that she even had a boyfriend. Oh, he must mean Bruce. Good grief, she\u2019d only seen him that one night. One date was all it\u2019d taken for both of them to realize that the only thing they had in common was loss. They were friendly, and they chatted now and then, but that was it.</p><p>\u201cI thought you should know,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if the call disturbed you,\u201d Rosie said, forcing a light tone into her voice. \u201cI\u2019m sure he forgot which nights I\u2019m at the house.\u201d She purposely allowed Zach to think she was seeing Bruce a lot.</p><p>\u201cDoes he phone often?\u201d Zach demanded, then paused. \u201cNever mind, I don\u2019t have any right to ask that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d It felt good to tell him that. \u201cThanks for letting me know. I\u2019ll get back to Bruce right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore we hang up, can we talk,\u201d he asked, \u201cjust for a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I promised Allison I wouldn\u2019t tie up the phone. She\u2019s expecting a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s always expecting a call,\u201d Zach muttered. \u201cSpeaking of Allison, how are the two of you getting along these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally well. Why?\u201d As long as Rosie stayed in one part of the house and Allison in another, they could cope, but there was no need to tell Zach that.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got nothing but attitude with me,\u201d he confessed reluctantly.</p><p>Rosie realized this must be hard on him. Zach and Allison had always been close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time are you getting home from work these days?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSame as always\u2014around five, sometimes five-thirty. Depends on where I\u2019m subbing. What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison is home when? Two-thirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround then.\u201d Their daughter\u2019s interest in after-school activities had ceased following the divorce. She\u2019d recently dropped out of volleyball, a sport she\u2019d once loved. Allison had decided against trying out for drama club, too. That disappointed Rosie, who believed Allison had a real flair for it, but no amount of discussion could persuade her daughter to reconsider.</p><p>\u201cI think Allison\u2019s got too much time on her hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d Rosie abandoned all pretense. She was desperately worried about her daughter and particularly about whatever might be happening with the boyfriend. Thankfully, there\u2019d been no sign of Ryan\u2019s presence in the house during the past two weeks, but that didn\u2019t mean he hadn\u2019t been there. Since Eddie\u2019s school wasn\u2019t dismissed until almost four, Allison had ample opportunity to see Ryan without anyone knowing where she was or with whom. The thought terrified Rosie.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d she asked Zach.</p><p>\u201cAny suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we need to talk more about this,\u201d Rosie said. \u201cFigure something out.\u201d</p><p>Zach agreed. \u201cListen,\u201d he said next. \u201cDo you and this Bruce guy get along?\u201d</p><p>She was about to remind him that her dating life was none of his concern, but changed her mind. \u201cWe get along all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do the kids think of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t introduced him yet.\u201d She had no intention of doing so, since it was unlikely she\u2019d go out with him a second time.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Zach exhaled slowly. \u201cRosie, I want you to know I wish you and Bruce well. I sincerely mean that.\u201d</p><p>Rosie felt like weeping and she struggled to hang on to her pride. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIf Janice makes you happy, then that\u2019s what I want for you, too.\u201d</p><p>They were silent for half a minute or so.</p><p>\u201cMy most important job now is to be a good father to my children,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cThe children are what\u2019s most important to me, too,\u201d she told him, but as she replaced the receiver, Rosie wondered if her failure as a wife and mother was what had gotten her into this predicament in the first place.</p><p>Pastor Dave Flemming planned to get in one last round of golf before the November rains arrived. Monday was his traditional day off, and he was prepared to take full advantage of the last bit of autumn sunshine. He stepped onto the lush green course at McDougal Woods and, to his surprise, saw Bob Beldon. Bob and his wife, Peggy, had recently started attending Cedar Cove Methodist. Peggy taught a Sunday school class and Bob had agreed to coach the youth basketball team. Dave liked Bob, and Peggy was one of the best cooks he\u2019d ever had the privilege of knowing. The last church social, she\u2019d brought a peach cobbler that had been the talk of the evening.</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for a partner?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Dave said affably; he welcomed the company.</p><p>They teed off at the first hole, then jumped into the cart. \u201cActually, we didn\u2019t meet by accident this afternoon,\u201d Bob admitted. \u201cI called the church, and your secretary told me you were going to be here.\u201d</p><p>Without a pause Dave reached for his five iron. \u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>Staring at the other man, Dave saw that he was pale, with dark shadows under his eyes. Bob had aged perceptibly in the last little while.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you might be able to give me some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if I can.\u201d</p><p>Bob\u2019s next shot was a slice that went into the trees. He muttered under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m not much good at this.\u201d</p><p>Dave was sympathetic. He had a wicked slice of his own, but he didn\u2019t comment, giving Bob the room he needed to speak his mind.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until the fourth hole that Bob said anything more. \u201cI\u2019ve had this recurring nightmare for thirty years\u2014ever since I got back from Nam.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dave stood by the golf cart. \u201cIs that what you\u2019d like to discuss?\u201d</p><p>Bob nodded and leaned heavily against the cart. \u201cThe event in the dream actually happened...I feel all the horror and panic, the numbing fear. I hear it and see it in graphic detail. I...live it all over again.\u201d</p><p>He climbed into the golf cart and closed his eyes. \u201cAfter Nam, I took to the bottle to forget.\u201d His voice was so low it was all Dave could do to make out the words.</p><p>\u201cYou started drinking?\u201d he clarified.</p> <p>Bob nodded, opening his eyes. \u201cAfter my tour of duty, I came back to Peggy. It didn\u2019t take me long to nearly destroy my marriage and my life by hiding behind an alcoholic haze. For a few years I could forget, but soon even the alcohol didn\u2019t help. That was when I went to AA. It\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m sober today.\u201d</p><p>Dave was growing concerned. If possible, Bob had gone even paler. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs part of the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, we\u2019re asked to make amends whenever possible. I can\u2019t undo what happened that day in the jungle. Peggy\u2019s the only one who knows all the details, the only one I\u2019ve ever told. Dan might\u2019ve said something to Grace before he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan Sherman?\u201d</p><p>Bob nodded again. \u201cWe enlisted for Nam after high school as part of the buddy program and went all the way through together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo Dan Sherman was with you in the jungle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Bob drew one hand along his face. \u201cI suspect it\u2019s the reason he shot himself. God knows I was tempted to do it myself, especially in the early days when I was drinking hard. From what I understand, a lot of men have taken that way out. Truth be known, I can understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you and Dan were such good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since then, we haven\u2019t been. After the war, Peggy and I moved around a lot. I worked as a plumber on big construction sites. We\u2019ve only been back in Cedar Cove for the last six years.\u201d Bob leaned forward and his arms circled the steering wheel. He stared into the distance. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to burden you with this, but I think I might be in some kind of trouble here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a burden,\u201d Dave assured him. \u201cJust tell me how I can help.\u201d</p><p>Bob\u2019s hands tightened around the steering wheel. \u201cI need to know what I should do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout what happened in the war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...and Dan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do for Dan at this point.\u201d Perhaps Bob was thinking he should somehow help Grace, but Dave doubted that.</p><p>Bob shook his head. \u201cI know, I know...\u201d</p><p>There was something Bob wasn\u2019t telling him, something he was holding back. Dave decided not to pry. Bob would tell him when he was ready.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention that sometimes, when I have this nightmare, I\u2019ve gotten out of bed and walked around the house? A couple of years ago, Peggy found me getting ready to go outside. I was still in my pajamas and I was clutching the car keys\u2014completely and totally asleep.\u201d</p><p>Dave nodded, hoping his lack of comment would encourage Bob to continue. A lot of this didn\u2019t add up, beginning with his talk about the dream, although that was obviously tied to whatever had happened in Nam.</p><p>Bob buried his face in his hands. \u201cI hit Peggy when she tried to stop me from leaving the house. I swear to God I didn\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s true,\u201d Dave said, responding to his friend\u2019s distress. \u201cIn a sleepwalking state, you\u2019re not conscious of your actions.\u201d</p><p>After a lengthy pause, Bob lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cI had the nightmare the night of that big storm, when the John Doe arrived.\u201d His jaw was clenched tight and Dave noticed a muscle spasm.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleepwalk?\u201d</p><p>Bob\u2019s face twisted in torment. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Peggy doesn\u2019t think so, but we were both tired and she can\u2019t be sure. I can\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>The confusion was starting to clear. \u201cDo you think you might\u2019ve had something to do with that unfortunate man\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Bob was silent for so long that Dave wondered if he\u2019d heard him. \u201cBob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered after a moment. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem likely, but...\u201d He let the rest fade.</p><p>\u201cHave the police questioned you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did in the beginning and one time shortly after. But I think they might want to talk to me again.\u201d</p><p>Dave didn\u2019t ask how he\u2019d come by that information. \u201cYou\u2019re concerned about what they might learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what happened that night. But it\u2019s more than not knowing. It\u2019s Dan\u2019s suicide\u2014and the fact that the stranger seemed...familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamiliar? How do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Bob turned his head and stared at the fairway. \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that I knew him. I\u2019ve gone over it again and again in my mind, but I can\u2019t put a name with his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you mentioned this to Roy McAfee?\u201d Dave asked.</p><p>Bob turned back and met his gaze. Dave could tell Bob was surprised by the suggestion.</p><p>\u201cYou think I should talk to Roy? Why would I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy\u2019s an ex-cop,\u201d Dave said. \u201cHe\u2019d be able to advise you a whole lot better than I can about what the police might be looking for. If you are somehow involved in this death, Roy can tell you about your rights and suggest an attorney.\u201d</p><p>Bob\u2019s shoulders relaxed visibly. \u201cYou really think he could help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Dave said. He slid into the golf cart next to his friend. \u201cBut we can both do something else that will help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cWe can pray.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>Grace Sherman\u2019s step was lighter than it had been in nearly two years. She pushed her grocery cart down the store aisle and sashayed a bit to the piped-in music: a golden oldie from The Mamas and the Papas.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the music, however, that had put her in such a good mood. It was Will Jefferson, Olivia\u2019s older brother. Tall, good-looking, successful\u2014a nuclear engineer\u2014and just...nice. He\u2019d recently been in Cedar Cove during Charlotte\u2019s bout with cancer, and Grace and Will had renewed their friendship then.</p><p>When Will had written her shortly after Dan\u2019s funeral, he\u2019d added his e-mail address. At first they\u2019d left short messages for each other once a day, but lately that had changed. Now they chatted online far longer and far more often. The night before, they\u2019d spent almost an hour on the computer with instant messaging.</p><p>Their \u201ctalking\u201d had started out innocently enough. Cliff Harding had agreed to a suspension of their relationship. Once she\u2019d learned about Dan\u2019s suicide, she\u2019d asked for time to deal with the complex emotions surrounding it. She hadn\u2019t made a decision about his letter yet, but was inclined to leave it alone. No good could come of disrupting lives now. His secret was safe with her. Cliff phoned once or twice a week; he let her know when he was going out of town, and while she was always glad to hear from him, his phone calls didn\u2019t excite her nearly as much as her online chats with Will.</p><p>She knew it was absurd to think their daily communications meant anything. Will was married\u2014although Grace suspected he wasn\u2019t happy. Of course, he was too much of a gentleman to say anything negative about his wife, but Grace read between the lines. Olivia had mentioned Will and Georgia\u2019s marriage only a few months ago. She\u2019d implied that there might be problems between her brother and his wife. And it did seem that if Will had this much time to spend on the computer every night, something must be lacking in his marriage.</p><p>They were friends, Grace told herself, nothing more. Friends becoming reacquainted. That was all. Still, she\u2019d admit that \u201ctalking\u201d to Will had become downright addictive.</p><p>Most nights she rushed home from work and hurried to log on to the computer because she knew he\u2019d be waiting for her. With the three-hour time difference, he\u2019d already had dinner and was as eager to exchange messages with her as she was with him.</p><p>Grace hadn\u2019t told anyone about these daily \u201cchats\u201d with Will. Her daughters wouldn\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t know him and might put the wrong connotation on their friendship. Kelly and Maryellen worried about her, and they\u2019d certainly disapprove of her having an online relationship, especially since Will was married. She thought about mentioning her \u201cInternet friend\u201d in a casual way, then changed her mind.</p><p>Nor had Grace said anything to Olivia. It wasn\u2019t that she was hiding the truth from her best friend. It was more\u2014well, Grace couldn\u2019t really explain why she hadn\u2019t said anything to Olivia. Probably because she suspected Olivia wouldn\u2019t approve, any more than her own daughters would. Grace enjoyed talking to Will so much that she didn\u2019t want to feel guilty about this one small pleasure. He seemed to enjoy chatting with her, too.</p><p>There was one other person Grace felt bad about not telling\u2014Cliff Harding. She liked Cliff and owed him far more than she could ever repay. He\u2019d been patient and kind during the long months after Dan\u2019s disappearance. He\u2019d entered her life at the bleakest hour and lent her strength and emotional support when she\u2019d needed it most.</p><p>When Cliff\u2019s marriage had fallen apart some years ago, he\u2019d taken early retirement from Boeing and purchased acreage in the Olalla Valley, a few miles south of Cedar Cove. He\u2019d been breeding horses and was beginning to make a name for himself. This was an occupation Grace knew nothing about, but Cliff was completely absorbed in what had once been a hobby.</p><p>Hurrying the cart down the aisle, Grace collected the remaining groceries she needed, went through the checkout and drove home. The instant she was in the door, she turned on her computer and raced around putting the perishables in the refrigerator while she waited to log on to the Internet. Buttercup followed her, and at one point Grace nearly tripped over the dog. She stopped long enough to scold her, then dumped some kibble in the golden retriever\u2019s bowl and continued with her task.</p><p>The phone rang. Balancing a quart of milk in one hand and a carton of eggs in the other, she awkwardly reached for the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, using her shoulder to press the phone to her ear. She opened the refrigerator door and thrust both items inside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s stating the obvious,\u201d she teased. They hadn\u2019t spoken for a couple of weeks. He\u2019d gone to California and must have returned sometime in the last few days.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you ever check your phone messages?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sorry. I haven\u2019t yet.\u201d She\u2019d been in such a rush that it hadn\u2019t even occurred to her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been trying to reach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor three days now, ever since I got home. I was tempted to stop at the library. I would have, if I could\u2019ve squeezed an extra moment into the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOn the Internet again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and quashed a pang of guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault, you know.\u201d Grace had Paul and Kelly\u2019s old computer, which Cliff had set up for her.</p><p>\u201cYou could always e-mail me,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Cliff groaned. \u201cI\u2019ve created a monster.\u201d He sounded good-natured about it, though.</p> <p>\u201cLike I said, this monster is one of your own making.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d he muttered, chuckling. \u201cSay, have you got plans for Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...\u201d It was only a few weeks away, but she hadn\u2019t given the holiday a thought. Last year she\u2019d spent Thanksgiving with Maryellen and the two of them had been miserable. It had been her first without Dan. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you went to your daughter\u2019s in Maryland for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cThis year I want you with me.\u201d</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t afford such a trip, but she hated admitting it. Since Dan\u2019s disappearance, she\u2019d had no money for luxuries or unnecessary expenditures. And because his death was a suicide, she hadn\u2019t been able to collect any life insurance benefits.</p><p>It was as if Cliff had read her thoughts. \u201cBefore you object, I\u2019m buying your ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYou can and you will,\u201d he insisted sternly. \u201cI\u2019m serious, Grace. It\u2019s time you met my daughter and she met you. Now, before you argue, I know you asked for a few months to deal with everything and I\u2019ve given it to you, but I do want you to meet Lisa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cliff...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have everything worked out, so don\u2019t argue with me. You\u2019ll sleep in the guest room and I\u2019ll bunk down on the sleeper sofa in the family room. It\u2019ll do you good to get away.\u201d</p><p>Grace hadn\u2019t been on a plane in years. There just weren\u2019t the funds for vacations or traveling, even during the best of times. She\u2019d last flown five years earlier to a library conference in San Antonio, Texas, and she\u2019d loved every minute of her adventure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to talk to the girls,\u201d she murmured, wondering whether she should accept Cliff\u2019s invitation or not.</p><p>\u201cDo that and get back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Still, she hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about this, Cliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sure. You\u2019re important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re important to me, too,\u201d she echoed. \u201cI want you to know how much I appreciate your patience with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will come and meet Lisa, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI really would love to,\u201d she said, not bothering to hide the excitement in her voice. Grace had never spent the holiday away from her daughters. Maryellen and Kelly routinely checked up on her, despite her constant reassurances, but after all these months of living by herself, Grace had grown accustomed to her own company. Maybe, if she took this trip, her daughters would finally stop worrying and begin to acknowledge her independence.</p><p>Her only other consideration was Cliff. She shouldn\u2019t lead him on like this, but the trip sounded so good and she was so eager to get out of Cedar Cove for a few days. Of course, it meant she wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to Will online, but he was bound to be busy with the holiday, too. Besides, didn\u2019t absence make the heart grow fonder?</p><p>A cold chill went down Zach\u2019s spine as he read Janice Lamond\u2019s letter of resignation, which had been waiting on his desk when he arrived for work that morning. Hardly able to believe what he was reading, he went over the details a second time.</p><p>Janice was quitting. Feeling slightly sick, he sank into his high-back leather chair. So this was the appreciation he got for training her as his personal assistant. This was the thanks he got for being her mentor, for showing her the ropes and giving her advantage after advantage.</p><p>Janice had been invaluable to him in the early days of his separation from Rosie. She\u2019d soothed his ego and offered him advice and encouragement.</p><p>Rosie had come up with this crazy idea that he was romantically involved with his assistant. That was utter nonsense, but there was no convincing her otherwise. For no better reason than her own jealousy, his ex-wife had insisted Zach fire the woman who\u2019d become his right hand at the office. Zach had refused, as any reasonable man would. Rosie had flown into a temper, and shortly after that he\u2019d moved out of the house.</p><p>In a telephone conversation a little while ago, Rosie had said she wished him and Janice well. He\u2019d let the comment slide. If he hadn\u2019t been able to convince Rosie of his innocence before the divorce, he didn\u2019t think there was much chance now. So he\u2019d kept silent.</p><p>Recently, though, Zach had seen his assistant with fresh eyes. He disapproved of the length of her skirts and had casually mentioned the way she dressed, as part of his latest employee review. He\u2019d assumed she\u2019d appreciate his continued support, as well as his advice. Perhaps he\u2019d overstepped his bounds. He\u2019d never mention something as personal as dress or makeup to any other employee, but he\u2019d thought he could with Janice. They were friends, weren\u2019t they? And she\u2019d certainly been pretty free with her advice when it came to his situation.</p><p>At the time she\u2019d listened quietly to his comments. He\u2019d been pleased by her willingness to accept constructive criticism.</p><p>Now this.</p><p>He waited for his irritation to subside and then called her into his office. A moment later, she walked in, avoiding eye contact.</p><p>\u201cI have your letter here,\u201d he said, figuring she\u2019d offer an explanation.</p><p>Janice refused to raise her eyes to his.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were unhappy with your position,\u201d he said, hoping to reason with her. In his opinion, it would be a mistake for her to quit at this point.</p><p>\u201cI have been happy,\u201d Janice admitted. She sounded a little embarrassed. \u201cThat is, until recently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your way of asking for a raise?\u201d Zach asked. No need to beat around the bush. Considering the time and cost that went into training a new employee, it was far better to retain the current employee and pay higher wages. He was willing to offer her a raise if she agreed to reconsider her resignation, but he did want it understood that he disapproved of her methods.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a pay increase,\u201d she said, and shook her head adamantly. \u201cI already have another job.\u201d</p><p>If Zach had been irritated earlier, he was downright angry now. \u201cI see,\u201d he said, working hard at concealing his reaction. Of all the ungrateful employees he\u2019d hired over the years, this one took the prize. \u201cIn that case, I wish you continued success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it best that I leave the company,\u201d Janice said, raising her head now to boldly meet his gaze.</p><p>The anger flashing in her eyes caught him completely by surprise. Why she had any reason to be upset was beyond him. Zach had seen to it that she\u2019d been well compensated for her skills. She\u2019d advanced quickly, with routine pay hikes. In fact, there\u2019d been some dissension in the office when Janice was given a promotion over other employees who\u2019d been with the firm longer.</p><p>\u201cBest that you resign?\u201d Zach repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, tilting her chin in a gesture of defiance. \u201cI found it highly unprofessional of you to suggest that my skirts are too short and that I wear too much makeup.\u201d</p><p>Zach opened and closed his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Janice. I can see that my comments were...not well received. You\u2019re right\u2014they were probably out of line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrankly, I think you have a lot of nerve.\u201d She paused. \u201cI thought...I hoped you\u2019d understand.\u201d</p><p>Zach frowned. He didn\u2019t know what on earth she was talking about.</p><p>\u201cI hoped that you and I, the two of us,\u201d she faltered, \u201cmight one day be more than just employee and employer. I thought we were friends, but I also wanted you to notice me\u2014as a woman.\u201d She gestured down at her skirt, her high-heeled shoes. \u201cI can see that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>So Rosie had been right all along; Janice had been on the make. How could he have been so stupid? The signs had been there from the beginning. He tightened his jaw. \u201cThat will be all. I\u2019ll see that your final check is drawn up immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re letting me go...now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks\u2019 paid leave should be adequate compensation,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>Without another word, Janice turned and walked out of his office. Zach was so angry he was shaking by the time she was gone. He hadn\u2019t fully recovered when his phone line buzzed.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cLine one,\u201d Janice said. \u201cIt\u2019s the high school.\u201d</p><p>Zach pushed down the button and reached for the receiver. If the high school was calling, he could bet it wasn\u2019t about contributing to the latest fund-raiser.</p><p>\u201cThis is Zachary Cox,\u201d he said in his most professional voice.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cox, this is LeAnn Duncan from Cedar Cove High School verifying that Allison is home sick today.\u201d</p><p>Zach stared up at the ceiling and held back a groan of frustration. \u201cNo, I dropped her off myself.\u201d It hadn\u2019t been an especially good morning. Allison had gotten up late and missed the bus and then she\u2019d given him grief when he\u2019d insisted on driving her to school on his way to the office.</p><p>It used to be that she sought out reasons for Zach to drop her off. They\u2019d chat and he\u2019d tease her about her outrageous music and she\u2019d call him a geek. Her teasing didn\u2019t offend him because those were good times with his daughter. Now he barely recognized the girl she\u2019d become.</p><p>For the second time that morning, a sick feeling came over him. \u201cI don\u2019t know where she\u2019d be,\u201d he said before the school secretary could ask the next obvious question. But by heaven, he\u2019d find her. And when he did, Zach would see to it that she never pulled this kind of stunt again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your concern, Mr. Cox, not ours.\u201d</p><p>He knew that, but he was already flustered by Janice\u2019s resignation. Now his daughter had made it her personal mission to screw up the rest of his day.</p><p>\u201cWhat are the consequences of her skipping classes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIs this her first offense?\u201d Mrs. Duncan asked. She paused and seemed to be scanning a chart or a computer screen. \u201cAh, I see here that it is. Has there been any upheaval in the family lately, Mr. Cox?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife and I were recently divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will do it. Well, I hope you can get the situation with Allison squared away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she have any detentions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for the first offense. She\u2019ll need to attend Saturday school if it happens again.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t; Zach would make sure of that.</p><p>\u201cA third time means automatic suspension.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a second or a third time,\u201d Zach assured her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Cox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he muttered as he replaced the receiver. He didn\u2019t remove his hand and automatically dialed South Ridge Elementary, where Rosie was currently teaching fifth grade. She\u2019d just been hired onto the permanent staff, which was both a blessing and a curse. It meant longer hours and more preparation time. He knew from Eddie\u2019s comments that Rosie was often exhausted at the end of the day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is Zachary Cox. Would it be possible to speak to my wife?\u201d he asked the school secretary, not remembering until after he\u2019d spoken that he was no longer married to Rosie. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease hold.\u201d</p><p>He must have waited five minutes before Rosie picked up the extension. \u201cZach,\u201d she said, alarm in her voice. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison skipped school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rosie was as shocked as he was. \u201cToday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. She conveniently missed the bus, but I insisted on dropping her off. I should\u2019ve known something was up, because she wasn\u2019t happy with my offer to chauffeur her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue.\u201d His initial reaction had been anger, but now he was alarmed. Allison was fifteen years old. His mind whirled with countless possibilities, none of them pleasant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the house as soon as I can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can leave the school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can if it\u2019s a family emergency, and if this doesn\u2019t qualify, I don\u2019t know what does.\u201d</p><p>Zach got to the house ten minutes before Rosie did. Zach watched her pull into the driveway; the car jerked forward as she stepped hard on the brakes. The driver\u2019s door was open before the engine was completely dead.</p><p>\u201cWe need to call Hannah\u2019s mother,\u201d she said as she rushed past him and into the house.</p><p>Zach hated letting Rosie see what a mess the house was. After all the complaints he\u2019d made about her housekeeping skills, the state of the living room was embarrassing. Thankfully she barely noticed as she ran into the kitchen and opened the drawer below the telephone, which was mounted on the wall.</p><p>She rummaged through the drawer until she found the address book. Then she squared her shoulders and lifted the receiver from its cradle.</p> <p>The transformation was truly amazing. As soon as the other woman\u2014presumably Hannah\u2019s mother\u2014answered the phone, it seemed Rosie didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>\u201cHello, Jane...yes, I know it\u2019s been ages. Good to hear your voice, too.\u201d</p><p>Rosie caught Zach\u2019s gaze and rolled her eyes. He smiled for the first time that day. Grabbing a kitchen chair, he straddled it as Rosie did her investigative work.</p><p>\u201cI understand Hannah and Allison are in the same algebra class. Yes, she\u2019s doing really well. She has her father\u2019s head for numbers. I think she\u2019ll probably be put in the advanced class next tri.\u201d</p><p>If that was true, it was news to Zach. The last school papers he\u2019d found\u2014by accident, when Allison had left them on the kitchen table\u2014gave every indication that she was close to flunking out of math class.</p><p>\u201cI heard Hannah went to Homecoming with J. T. Manners. Isn\u2019t he a friend of Ryan Wilson\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Zach watched as Rosie made a few murmurs of agreement. Her eyes narrowed and she reached for a pencil and hurriedly wrote something down. Zach stood and looked over her shoulder. In an instant his anger flared back to life. Rosie had written: She took the ferry to Seattle.</p><p>The very thought of his daughter wandering around downtown Seattle by herself was enough to make the hair on the back of his neck stand up. A second or two later, he realized Allison probably wasn\u2019t alone. That no-good biker-wannabe boyfriend was most likely with her.</p> <p>After a few more minutes, Rosie replaced the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she\u2019s in Seattle?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cJane sings like a canary the minute she knows she has an audience. She knew and was dying to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHannah isn\u2019t with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows.\u201d Rosie was angry, too. She started suddenly for the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cTo move my car. I want the two of us to be waiting here when she comes sneaking back.\u201d</p><p>Zach liked the idea of lying in wait for Allison. It was the best way he could think of to prove to his rebellious daughter that she wasn\u2019t going to outsmart him.</p><p>A few minutes later, a breathless Rosie returned. She took the chair across from him and exhaled slowly. They sat in the kitchen without speaking for five minutes. Ten...The silence felt strange and awkward, as though each was afraid of bringing up the subject of their difficult daughter. Zach knew he was. If they started talking, he might have to admit the role he\u2019d played in this mess.</p><p>Furthermore, Zach wasn\u2019t sure what to say, especially after his enlightening conversation with Janice that morning. Apparently Rosie didn\u2019t either. When he thought he couldn\u2019t sit still a moment longer, Zach stood and began straightening up the living room. Rosie tackled the kitchen, which was in even worse shape. Once he\u2019d finished vacuuming, he moved into the kitchen. They worked side by side for an hour.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d Rosie asked.</p><p>Zach hadn\u2019t thought about it, but now that she asked, he realized he was. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a ham sandwich?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a slice of pineapple to go with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd cream cheese?\u201d he asked hopefully. When they\u2019d first started dating Rosie had invented the sandwich and it was his all-time favorite. He couldn\u2019t remember when he\u2019d last had one.</p><p>As Rosie put the sandwiches on plates, he got cold sodas from the refrigerator, and they sat down across from each other again. Searching for possible topics of conversation, Zach almost mentioned that Janice had handed in her notice. He bit his tongue before he could make such a foolish mistake. Rosie would certainly gloat over that information. She was apparently dating this widower now, and the relationship must be going well. She might be stressed and tired, but he\u2019d never seen her look better. He glanced away before she caught him staring at her.</p><p>They heard the front door open, followed by the sound of teenage laughter.</p><p>Zach and Rosie were instantly on their feet. They hurried into the living room and discovered Allison, another girl Zach didn\u2019t recognize\u2014possibly Hannah\u2014and Allison\u2019s so-called boyfriend. The three teens froze when they saw Zach and Rosie.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Allison demanded, glaring defiantly back at them.</p><p>\u201cI think it would be best if your friends left now,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cThey can stay if they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d If she was looking for a standoff in their battle of wills, Zach figured he had the advantage. He stalked over to the front door and opened it wide. \u201cNice seeing you both, don\u2019t come back again unless invited.\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cDo I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded and edged toward the front door as though he couldn\u2019t get away fast enough. The other girl looked unsure, then decided leaving was probably her best option.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d Zach snapped.</p><p>Rosie stepped forward. \u201cDon\u2019t give her the opportunity to lie, Zach,\u201d she said, sounding perfectly calm and reasonable. He, on the other hand, was furious and not afraid to show it.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you?\u201d Allison muttered. She crossed her arms and stared angrily at them both.</p><p>\u201cYou skipped school and took the ferry over to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>That her mother knew was clearly a shock to Allison. The girl\u2019s lips curled as if she were about to ask where Rosie had uncovered that information, but she stopped herself before the question had formed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to be smarter than this if you want to fool your parents,\u201d Rosie said smoothly.</p><p>Zach was grateful that Rosie was the one doing the talking. In his present frame of mind, he was useless. The urge to take Allison by the shoulders and give her a good shake was almost overwhelming. He\u2019d been worried sick. Apparently she didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d put her parents through; furthermore she didn\u2019t care. That was the crux of the matter. She didn\u2019t give a damn, and he said as much before he could censor the words.</p><p>\u201cThat was a crazy, selfish stunt you pulled, and I\u2019m here to tell you it won\u2019t be happening again.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s eyes flared with defiance. \u201cI hate you!\u201d she shouted. \u201cI hate you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can hate me all you want, but you\u2019ll respect the rules of this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis family,\u201d she echoed. \u201cWhat family? You destroyed our family.\u201d She pointed at Zach and then Rosie. \u201cBoth of you destroyed our family. I hate you\u2014I hate both of you for what you did.\u201d Whirling around, she raced toward her bedroom and slammed the door with enough force to rattle the pictures on the wall. The eight-by-ten family portrait, taken two years previously, swung violently and then crashed to the floor. The glass shattered.</p><p>Silence ensued, and Zach collected his breath. \u201cWell,\u201d he murmured, \u201cthat\u2019s that.\u201d He wasn\u2019t proud of the way he\u2019d lost his composure. In fact, he didn\u2019t feel proud of much at the moment.</p><p>At least Rosie had been with him when he\u2019d confronted Allison and they\u2019d faced her united. She was much better at this sort of thing than he was. His ex-wife knew what to say. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>After a few minutes, Rosie gathered her purse and coat and started for the front door. She seemed reluctant to leave and he was equally unwilling to let her go.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, walking with her. \u201cYou handled the situation ten times better than I could have. I\u2019m grateful you were here.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, dismissing his praise.</p><p>The irony didn\u2019t hit him until after Rosie was gone. It seemed that they got along a whole lot better since they were divorced than they had while they were married.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Saturday morning a week before Thanksgiving, Maryellen woke with a mission. Her nails were a mess. She was badly in need of a manicure and polish, and felt eternally grateful that she\u2019d managed to book an appointment with Rachel at Get Nailed. Because Jon\u2019s days off changed from week to week, Maryellen was never entirely sure when to schedule an appointment. As soon as she learned he\u2019d be taking Katie on Saturday morning, she\u2019d phoned the salon. Rachel could do her nails but didn\u2019t have a free slot to trim her hair.</p><p>Maryellen never seemed to have time for herself anymore. Being a single mother and holding down a job was much more demanding than she\u2019d ever envisioned. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for Katie to wake up once and sometimes twice a night. If it hadn\u2019t been for Jon taking their daughter on random evenings, Maryellen wouldn\u2019t have slept through a single night in the entire three months since Katie\u2019s birth.</p><p>As soon as she\u2019d showered and dressed, Maryellen headed for Get Nailed, her spirits high.</p><p>Rachel was finishing with her previous client when Maryellen entered the shop. Her nail appointment had gone from once a week to whenever she could fit it in. This time it\u2019d been three weeks since she\u2019d last seen Rachel, but that couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>Maryellen loved the \u201cgirls\u201d at Get Nailed. They were witty and a little on the wacky side. A year earlier, they\u2019d come up with the unusual idea of a Halloween party at which they introduced their discarded boyfriends to one another in the hope that someone else might find \u201ctrue love.\u201d In the beginning it had actually sounded like a workable idea and several of the girls had hooked up with guys. Then catastrophe struck when certain behavioral problems exhibited earlier in the discarded boyfriends resurfaced. Maryellen still smiled when she thought about it. The disastrous party was long forgotten now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maryellen missed the special camaraderie she\u2019d shared with the other women now that her visits were so infrequent.</p><p>\u201cI need a hair appointment for next week,\u201d she told Terri, who was handling the front desk. The shop was divided into two sections: hair and nails. Rachel was the only attendant who did both, and Maryellen preferred to stay with her.</p><p>\u201cRachel can do it next Thursday at five if that\u2019s okay for you,\u201d Terri said, grabbing the pencil from behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cI may have to bring Katie with me.\u201d It all depended on whether Katie could stay with Kelly for an extra hour or Jon could take their daughter. Not so long ago, she didn\u2019t need to consider such things, but these days Maryellen\u2019s world revolved around Katie\u2014Katie\u2019s schedule, Katie\u2019s needs.</p> <p>Terri sighed with regret. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we have a \u2018no kids\u2019 policy.\u201d She leaned over the glass counter and lowered her voice. \u201cSo many young mothers were bringing toddlers to their appointments that we had to do something. It just isn\u2019t a safe environment for youngsters. I know Katie\u2019s an infant, but we had to draw the line. I hope this won\u2019t be a problem for you.\u201d She wore an apologetic expression.</p><p>Maryellen understood. As a customer, she found it distracting to have small children constantly underfoot. She bit her lower lip. \u201cIs there anyone who could trim my hair this morning?\u201d It would only take a few minutes to clip off the split ends.</p><p>\u201cI just had a cancellation,\u201d Terri said. She cocked her head to one side as she studied Maryellen with fresh eyes. \u201cYou want it cut, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrimmed,\u201d she corrected. Maryellen had worn her hair in the same easy style for years. Her dark curls fell midway down her back. She\u2019d recently begun wearing it tied at the base of her neck, free from Katie\u2019s exploring fingers.</p><p>Terri shook her head. \u201cCut. You need a change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>With one fist on her hip, Terri nodded. \u201cShort, I think. How long have you had it this length?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen had lost count of the number of years.</p><p>\u201cToo long,\u201d Terri answered for her. \u201cYup. It\u2019s time for a change.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was starting to see the possibilities. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later Maryellen emerged with freshly painted fingernails and her hair in a soft straight cut that framed her face. She barely recognized herself in the mirror, but she liked the change and hoped Jon would feel the same.</p> <p>She stopped herself abruptly. It didn\u2019t matter what Jon thought. He was part of Katie\u2019s life, not hers, and she\u2019d better remember that.</p><p>Even as she reminded herself of her own small role in Jon\u2019s world, her heart pounded with anticipation as she drove out to his house to pick up Katie. He was supposed to work that afternoon, and Maryellen had an errand to run in Tacoma, so it made sense to get Katie on her way.</p><p>This was one of those rare November days in the Pacific Northwest, when the sky\u2019s a clear, bright blue and the air is crisp and cold. Driving down the now-familiar gravel driveway to Jon\u2019s house, Maryellen noticed an eagle overhead. With its huge wings extended, the magnificent bird soared on an updraft, as though it reigned from its lofty height.</p><p>As Maryellen pulled her vehicle to a stop, she saw Jon with Katie strapped to his back, looking toward the sky with a camera pointed at the eagle. Their daughter was awake and happy, waving her arms and making delighted sounds, obviously enjoying the out-of-doors.</p><p>Jon must have heard Maryellen approach, because he lowered his camera and turned to face her. For a long moment he didn\u2019t say anything as he stared at the drastic change in her appearance. Self-consciously, Maryellen lifted her hand to her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d She wanted to kick herself for asking.</p><p>He walked closer, studying her, while she stood rooted to the spot.</p><p>He cleared his throat as if searching for something to say that wouldn\u2019t hurt her feelings. \u201cIt...takes some getting used to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d It shouldn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t. She\u2019d cut her hair on a whim, for herself and no one else. Jon\u2019s opinion, no matter what it was, held no weight. And yet...it did. He clearly didn\u2019t like the change and Maryellen was crushed.</p><p>To cover her disappointment, she reached for Katie, who was bundled up in a thick fleece outfit. Her daughter kicked her legs ecstatically as Maryellen freed her from the carrier.</p><p>As soon as Maryellen held the infant in her arms, Jon raised the camera once more. \u201cCome on,\u201d he urged, \u201cgive me a smile.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen tried, but she wasn\u2019t in the mood.</p><p>He took two or three pictures. \u201cAgain,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Katie was certainly a willing subject. Smiling and gurgling, she flailed her arms about from the crook of Maryellen\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Jon said, briefly lowering the camera. \u201cNow you\u2019re happy. Laugh away, young lady.\u201d</p><p>Despite her mood, Maryellen grinned. \u201cDid Katie keep you up last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I got more than a few hours\u2019 sleep.\u201d He rubbed his hand over his eyes. \u201cKatie was in a foul mood. Nothing satisfied her. I spent most of the night sitting in the rocking chair with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she might be teething.\u201d Maryellen, too, had spent many nights dozing in an upright position. Needless to say, the next workday always ended up being hectic. In an odd way, it comforted her to know that Jon was experiencing the same troubles she did.</p><p>Out of habit, Maryellen raised her hand to flip her hair to one side, but it was too short now to toss off her shoulder.</p><p>Jon took picture after picture while she stood there.</p><p>\u201cCome inside and I\u2019ll make us a cup of coffee,\u201d he said when he\u2019d finished. She wondered if he\u2019d abandoned his art photography in favor of snapping pictures of Katie. Pictures of their daughter were all she\u2019d seen of his work lately. Of course, he was under contract with the Seattle gallery, and she didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d submitted anything in the last couple of months. She did know his work continued to sell well and she was pleased for him.</p><p>Jon paused when she didn\u2019t immediately follow him into the house for coffee. \u201cDo you have time?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Since their bout of kissing, Maryellen had managed to avoid spending time alone with Jon. He hadn\u2019t pressured her or questioned her reasons. \u201cI...can\u2019t stay,\u201d she said.</p><p>No argument came. It was almost as if he\u2019d expected her to decline.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Katie\u2019s things for you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Unsure what prompted her, Maryellen walked inside with him. \u201cHow\u2019s everything going at The Lighthouse?\u201d she asked, making casual conversation. She found the success of Seth and Justine\u2019s restaurant particularly gratifying, knowing Jon was employed as head chef. People raved about his innovative dishes. He was a talented, complex man.</p><p>Jon gathered up Katie\u2019s favorite blanket and stuffed it into her diaper bag. He found a toy rattle, which he also stuck in the bag.</p><p>\u201cI heard it\u2019s impossible to get a reservation for the weekends.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, then looked up, his dark gaze probing hers. \u201cDo you need one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d she said, not understanding the change in his mood.</p><p>\u201cNo Saturday-night date?\u201d he pried.</p><p>Maryellen laughed. \u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t get your hair styled to impress me, now did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it for me, Jon.\u201d</p><p>His muscles relaxed as he slipped the strap of the diaper bag over his shoulder and gave her a brief smile. She was sure, for a moment, that he wanted to kiss her. \u201cThat\u2019s comforting to hear,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>His concern\u2014was it jealousy?\u2014was so endearing, she had to resist touching him. In an effort to hide her attraction, she said, \u201cThe girls at the nail shop said how wonderful the food at The Lighthouse is.\u201d Terri had recently dined at the restaurant. Rachel, too.</p><p>\u201cThank them for me,\u201d he said in an offhand manner, as if compliments embarrassed him.</p><p>\u201cThey asked me if I knew where you got your training. I don\u2019t believe you ever mentioned it.\u201d Terri had, in fact, asked her that, and Maryellen took advantage of her friend\u2019s interest to ask a question she herself had wondered about.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I didn\u2019t.\u201d His response was blunt. Clearly he didn\u2019t welcome any further inquiries.</p><p>\u201cBut you must have been formally trained to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d He glanced pointedly at his watch. \u201cI need to get ready for work.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen was stunned. Every previous time she\u2019d been to Jon\u2019s place, he\u2019d practically thrown himself in front of her car to detain her. Now it seemed he couldn\u2019t get rid of her fast enough.</p><p>Absently Maryellen looped a strand of hair around her ear, forgetting once again that her curls were much shorter now than they\u2019d been a few hours earlier. This reaction of Jon\u2019s was so confusing.</p><p>Silently he walked her to the car and handed her the diaper bag. \u201cDo you have your work schedule for next week?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He stood beside her vehicle while she strapped Katie into her carrier in the back seat.</p><p>When she straightened, she noticed that his attention appeared to be elsewhere. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I\u2019ll wait to hear from you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She hesitated, sorry to end their time on such a negative note, but she was unsure what had gone wrong or why. \u201cGoodbye, and...thank you.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back from her car and Maryellen got inside and slid the key into the ignition. As she pulled away, she looked in her rearview mirror. Jon was still standing there.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cAre we going to have a big turkey like Mom always cooked?\u201d Eddie asked Thanksgiving morning.</p><p>Zach wasn\u2019t fully awake yet, and already his son was demanding answers to questions he could barely comprehend. \u201cSure,\u201d he said sleepily as he sat up in bed. He glanced at the clock-radio and saw that it was only eight. Sleeping in, apparently, was not an option.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should put it in the oven now?\u201d Eddie asked.</p><p>The turkey was supposed to be in the oven? This early? Then Zach remembered he\u2019d already solved this issue at the local grocery store. The national chain offered fully cooked Thanksgiving dinners, complete with a thirteen-pound turkey, mashed potatoes, giblet gravy, plus dressing. As a bonus, they threw in a can of cranberry sauce and a pumpkin pie.</p><p>\u201cMom always had the turkey in the oven early in the morning, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d Eddie was almost bouncing on Zach\u2019s bed.</p><p>Frankly Zach didn\u2019t remember. What he recalled was the tension during Thanksgiving dinner last year, when he\u2019d been fighting with Rosie. They\u2019d barely managed to get through the day without a major blowup. This year was different. This year it was Zach and the kids and no one else.</p><p>According to the terms of the divorce, Zach had been awarded all the major holidays, including Thanksgiving, but Rosie got Christmas Day. He could have Allison and Eddie Christmas Eve, but only until midnight. Heaven forbid if he stayed here one minute past. He remembered Rosie\u2019s anger as he\u2019d disputed those terms and suspected she\u2019d welcome the opportunity to drag him back into court. So much for peace and goodwill, he mused darkly. During the crisis precipitated by Allison\u2019s rebellious behavior, he and Rosie had been aligned in their views and actions, but things had quickly reverted to the earlier animosity. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs Allison up?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>Eddie frowned and shook his head. \u201cDo you want me to set the table for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we have breakfast first?\u201d Zach mumbled, although he was beginning to share his son\u2019s enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to?\u201d Eddie whined. \u201cI want stuffing. It\u2019s my favorite part of the dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d Zach confided. Rosie might have her faults as a cook, but she did make the most incredible dressing. His mouth started to water before he remembered that Rosie wouldn\u2019t be stuffing the bird this year. Albertson\u2019s would.</p><p>While Zach showered, shaved and dressed, Eddie watched the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade on television. Zach was pleasantly surprised to find Allison awake and sitting in the family room. She lounged on the sofa with her bare feet braced on the edge of the coffee table while she leafed through the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Zach greeted her, uncertain what to expect in response. It was a day-to-day struggle with his daughter.</p><p>Her reply was half growl and half human. Zach had suggested a truce over the holiday, and Allison had agreed, but she\u2019d let it be known that she was doing him a big favor and he should be grateful.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d he asked, sinking down onto the sofa next to her. If Allison was willing to make an effort, then so could he. He held a cup of coffee in his hand and had half an eye on the television screen.</p> <p>\u201cThe ads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdvertisements?\u201d Zach asked, her answer catching him off guard.</p><p>Eddie raced into the kitchen and returned with a huge bowl of cold cereal. Milk sloshed over the edges as he lowered himself to a cross-legged position on the floor. Zach was about to send him back to the other room, but he didn\u2019t feel right being so strict with his son on a holiday. Eddie could eat in the family room this once, despite the rules.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s the biggest Christmas-shopping day of the year,\u201d Allison informed him, continuing to turn the pages of the flyers, scanning each one with care.</p><p>These flyers didn\u2019t mean a lot to Zach. He hated shopping. Rosie was the one who purchased all the Christmas gifts. He dreaded the thought of even entering a mall. Last Christmas he\u2019d asked Janice to buy Rosie\u2019s gifts for him; not only had she done a decent job, but she\u2019d wrapped them, as well. His gift to Janice had been a cash bonus, a generous amount\u2014not a personal gift but a practical one\u2014and he\u2019d figured that as a single mother, Janice could use the extra money at Christmas. It still rankled that she\u2019d resigned.</p><p>\u201cMom and I used to read through every single ad,\u201d Allison said absently.</p> <p>This information wasn\u2019t exactly life-changing. Women enjoyed that sort of thing, he guessed.</p><p>\u201cIt was fun.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, not understanding the sadness he heard in his daughter\u2019s voice. This was beyond him. If she wanted to get all sentimental over a bunch of advertisements, he\u2019d let her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d Allison sobbed, her eyes swimming with tears.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and I used to go shopping. It was our tradition. We had fun. I loved picking out my clothes for Christmas, and Mom was great about finding exactly what I wanted on sale.\u201d</p><p>Zach was sorry, but he still didn\u2019t get it. \u201cYou can go shopping with your mother in the morning if you want.\u201d More power to them, as far as he was concerned. Then, thinking he\u2019d add a bit of levity to the situation, he said. \u201cEddie, your mother and Allison can go shopping tomorrow, can\u2019t they? We don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can go,\u201d Eddie told his sister.</p> <p>In response Allison hurled down the newspaper and stormed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Eddie asked. He picked up his bowl and drank from the edge, making loud slurping noises.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Zach muttered. He\u2019d better go find out what he\u2019d done that had warranted this reaction.</p><p>He discovered his daughter lying across her unmade bed, weeping her eyes out. Zach sighed. Sitting on the edge of her bed, he placed his hand on Allison\u2019s shoulder. She jerked away, telling him in no uncertain terms that she found his touch repugnant.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart,\u201d he said.</p><p>Allison curled up tightly. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d she demanded between sobs.</p><p>\u201cBecause I love you, and it hurts me to see you so unhappy.\u201d Zach was sincere about that.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison, you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re my princess, don\u2019t you remember?\u201d He\u2019d called her that for years, until she\u2019d asked him not to when she reached thirteen. Every now and then, he forgot.</p><p>Allison rolled onto her back and stared up at him, red-faced.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it about the newspaper ads that upset you so much?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>His daughter sat up and ran the back of her hand under her nose. \u201cMom said we can\u2019t go shopping tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Zach didn\u2019t understand why Rosie was breaking such a beloved tradition, especially when it meant so much to Allison. They were looking for a way to build a bridge with their daughter, not blow it up!</p><p>\u201cMom said there wasn\u2019t any money for Christmas this year because of the divorce.\u201d</p><p>Zach wanted to groan out loud. He was hurting financially himself. Maintaining two households, paying off what he owed the attorneys, plus covering the cost of Rosie\u2019s summer courses, had left him dry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, meaning it.</p><p>Allison\u2019s lower lip trembled as she nodded. \u201cI know you are, but that doesn\u2019t change a damn thing, does it?\u201d</p><p>Zach had to agree she was right.</p><p>At noon, when Eddie couldn\u2019t wait a moment longer, Zach drove to the grocery store and picked up their Thanksgiving feast. Allison had all the serving plates and bowls out when he returned.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to dirty those,\u201d he said, thinking of all the extra dishes they would create. The dishwasher could only hold so much.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t serve mashed potatoes out of a plastic container on Thanksgiving Day,\u201d Allison protested.</p><p>\u201cSure we can,\u201d Eddie insisted righteously. \u201cCome on, Allison, you\u2019re holding up the stuffing.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s teenage daughter rolled her eyes and surrendered.</p><p>With great ceremony Zach unloaded the box. The turkey was browned to perfection and Zach brought out the knife and fork to slice it, lifting the meat from the bird and transferring it to each of their plates. While he worked on the turkey Allison and Eddie helped themselves to the trimmings.</p><p>They waited until he\u2019d finished dishing up his own plate and then the three of them joined hands for the prayer. Zach didn\u2019t feel much like praying so he said, \u201cGood food, good meat. Good God, let\u2019s eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d Eddie cried, and reached for his fork.</p><p>Allison looked at Zach, slowly shaking her head. It went without saying that if Rosie had been with them, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten away with that. Zach winked at her. She winked back. It was almost like having his daughter back.</p><p>His first bite was disappointing. The stuffing was too bland, although he supposed that made sense. The grocery store prepared huge amounts at a time and had to satisfy a lot of different tastes.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Zach said, putting on a bright front.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t taste right,\u201d Eddie complained.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Mom\u2019s stuffing,\u201d Allison informed them both.</p><p>No one needed to tell Eddie that. He complained with every bite and finally left the table after declining a piece of pumpkin pie.</p><p>Zach assumed his son was in front of the television, but when he went to join him and tempt him with pie, Eddie wasn\u2019t there. A search found his son sitting on his bed crying.</p><p>Eddie had been a real trooper through the divorce proceedings. It was Allison who\u2019d acted out her anger and rejection, Allison who\u2019d given him his first gray hairs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry the stuffing was a disappointment,\u201d Zach said, standing in the doorway.</p><p>Eddie rubbed his eyes and sniffed.</p><p>Zach walked into the room and gathered his boy in his arms. It wasn\u2019t often that Eddie crawled onto his lap anymore, but the nine-year-old came willingly now. He wrapped his arms around Zach\u2019s neck and sniffled loudly.</p><p>\u201cI wish you and Mom had never gotten a divorce,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Zach whispered. With all his heart he wished he\u2019d fought harder to save his marriage. Whatever it cost him would\u2019ve been worth it to avoid the pain he and Rosie had inflicted on their children. Now it was too late. They couldn\u2019t undo what they\u2019d done.</p><p>Grace looked across the Thanksgiving table at Cliff and smiled, but her mind was a thousand miles away\u2014in Georgia, where Will was spending the holiday with his wife and longtime friends.</p><p>After two days without word from him, she was suffering withdrawal symptoms. Her fingers itched for a computer keyboard so she could log on and talk to Will. When she\u2019d inquired, Grace learned that Lisa and her husband had a computer, but it was kept in a corner of their bedroom. She felt awkward about asking to use it. Lisa hadn\u2019t offered, and Grace had been forced to drop the matter. The fact that chatting online with Will had become so important confused and bothered her. Only a few months ago he was a boy from her past, a high school crush, and suddenly he was so much more.</p><p>Then there was Cliff, and her feelings toward him were equally confusing. She was grateful to spend Thanksgiving with him and at the same time regretted accepting his invitation.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d Cliff broke into her rambling thoughts.</p><p>She glanced at him and realized she\u2019d missed something. She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisa was asking if you\u2019d like more turkey.\u201d</p><p>She stared down at her plate and shook her head. \u201cThank you, but no, I\u2019m stuffed.\u201d She placed her hands on her stomach to give the impression that she\u2019d overeaten, but she\u2019d barely touched her dinner.</p><p>This trip to Maryland was more difficult than Grace had anticipated. They\u2019d made the cross-country flight without problems, but sitting with Cliff for several hours the day before had been...uncomfortable. At one point early on, Cliff had reached for her hand, lacing his fingers with hers, creating a mood of intimacy she didn\u2019t want and couldn\u2019t feel.</p><p>Lisa and her husband, Rich, were at the airport when Cliff and Grace landed. Cliff\u2019s three-year-old granddaughter, April, had raced to his arms and he\u2019d lifted her high in the air.</p><p>Thanksgiving morning, Grace had spent some time with Cliff\u2019s daughter. Grace had liked Lisa immediately. She was very close to her father, and her adoration reminded Grace of the way Kelly had felt about Dan. As far as Kelly was concerned, Dan was about as perfect as a father could be. Lisa felt protective of her father, as Kelly had, drilling Grace at every opportunity to find out more about the relationship between her and Cliff.</p><p>When they\u2019d finished their meal, the men wandered into the living room, to watch a football game on television. April went down for her nap, and Grace helped Lisa clear off the table. During her trips from the dining room to the kitchen, Grace noticed Cliff watching her. When he realized she knew, he smiled sheepishly and looked away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace\u2019s heart fell. Cliff was obviously in love with her. For a while she\u2019d been convinced she loved him, too, but now she was no longer sure of that\u2014or anything.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first woman my father\u2019s shown any interest in since he and my mother divorced,\u201d Lisa said as Grace set the last of the dirty dishes on the kitchen counter. The house was cozy, and Lisa had decorated it in a kind of English-cottage style. She was a tall, lithe blonde; Grace wondered if that was how Susan, Cliff\u2019s ex-wife, had looked, too.</p><p>\u201cI think the world of your father,\u201d Grace told her, and it was true.</p><p>Lisa ran water into the sink, adding detergent, and slid the pans into the suds. \u201cMom hurt him badly. It\u2019s taken a long time for Dad to get over the divorce. I was beginning to wonder if he ever would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome wounds go very deep,\u201d Grace said as a niggling guilt worked on her conscience\u2014because it was Will who dominated her thoughts, Will who sent her pulse soaring. If she\u2019d needed anything to prove how strongly she felt about him, these last two days had done exactly that.</p><p>Accepting Cliff\u2019s invitation had encouraged the relationship, and that had been wrong for both of them. Although Grace liked Cliff, enjoyed his company, she considered him a friend, a very dear and good friend, but nothing more.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s been so busy lately, he\u2019s worried that you\u2019ve given up on him,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cWe talk every week, and you\u2019re the main topic of conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and the guy who turned up dead at the bed-and-breakfast,\u201d she joked, then grew serious. \u201cHe asks my advice. I was the one who urged him to ask you out that first time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I should thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe admired the fact that you refused until your divorce was final.\u201d Those had been bleak days in Grace\u2019s life, as she\u2019d confronted the unknown. Dan\u2019s body had yet to be found, and she\u2019d felt certain he was with another woman. Her self-esteem had been in tatters, and then along came this handsome rancher who courted her with gentleness and humor.</p><p>\u201cI told Dad he should hire a full-time trainer, otherwise he was going to lose you,\u201d Lisa said. She opened the dishwasher, a model as old as Grace\u2019s, and arranged the dishes inside.</p><p>\u201cI understand what it\u2019s like to start up a new business,\u201d Grace hurriedly assured her. The truth was, she\u2019d barely noticed that she hadn\u2019t heard from him much lately. Anytime she did hear from Cliff, it had seemed like an intrusion.</p><p>She hated feeling this way, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Cliff was like Buttercup. He was big and warm and friendly and there when she needed him. On the other hand, her friendship with Will was exciting and new. The two of them talking for hours every day and keeping it a secret held a hint of intrigue. They were conspirators.</p><p>\u201cAre you in love with my father?\u201d Lisa asked, her arms elbow-deep in dishwater.</p> <p>\u201cI...I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you embarrassing our dinner guest?\u201d Cliff asked as he stepped into the kitchen. He stood behind Grace, slid his arms around her waist and kissed the side of her neck. She closed her eyes\u2014not to savor the tenderness of the moment, but in relief because she didn\u2019t have to answer Lisa\u2019s question.</p><p>This was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t say anything to Cliff. Not with his daughter and her husband so close. Not with Cliff\u2019s granddaughter napping in the other room. It would have to wait until they were back in Cedar Cove, in familiar territory.</p><p>She could have told him on the flight home, but Grace refused to do that to him, especially after the hospitality his family had shown her. That would\u2019ve piled wrong on top of wrong.</p><p>The instant Grace was back in Cedar Cove, she collected Buttercup from Kelly and Paul\u2019s and headed home. Ten minutes after she walked in the front door, she was sitting in front of her computer.</p><p>\u201cOh, be there,\u201d she whispered as she logged onto the Internet. She brought up the message board and hit the appropriate icons and waited an interminable few moments.</p><p>\u201cWill, are you there?\u201d she typed.</p><p>Almost immediately he responded. \u201cWelcome back. How was Thanksgiving with your boyfriend?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWonderful. How about yours?\u201d she typed, wincing at the half lie.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a good time, but I missed our chats,\u201d she typed.</p><p>It seemed forever before Will answered. \u201cGrace, thank you. I hated being without you. I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019ve come to rely on our talks to get me through the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rely on you, too,\u201d her fingers raced to tell him. She gnawed on her lower lip. \u201cI thought about you constantly.\u201d</p><p>Another long moment passed. \u201cYou\u2019re all I thought about, too.\u201d</p><p>Grace shouldn\u2019t be this happy, but joy filled her. She felt like a teenager all over again\u2014a teenager head over heels in love.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>Thick, dark clouds marred the December-morning sky over Cedar Cove. Peggy Beldon walked down the stairs, and from her view through the upper hallway window, she saw that the waters of the cove were murky and restless, churning up whitecaps.</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise her that Bob was already awake. He\u2019d probably been up for hours. Ever since he\u2019d talked to Pastor Flemming, that day at the golf course, he\u2019d been sleeping poorly. When she\u2019d asked him about it, Bob had repeatedly shrugged off her questions. She\u2019d pressured him until she got an answer, although it hadn\u2019t been too satisfactory.</p><p>In the beginning, their marriage had been shaky. Bob wasn\u2019t the same after Vietnam. They\u2019d married shortly after he was discharged from the army, but he\u2019d started drinking by then. At first it was just a few beers with his friends after work. Peggy didn\u2019t begrudge him that. Then Hollie was born, followed two years later by Marc, and Peggy had been so preoccupied with motherhood she hadn\u2019t really noticed what was happening to her husband. Soon he was out with the boys every night or bringing his drinking buddies home. She and Bob had argued often and she\u2019d grown increasingly desperate.</p><p>The summer afternoon Bob received his first DUI, she realized that his drinking was more than a few beers with friends; it had become a serious problem that dominated their marriage and their lives. Despite her tears and her pleas, he refused to acknowledge there was anything wrong.</p><p>Peggy would always be grateful to the friend who\u2019d recommended she start attending Al-Anon meetings. Without the support and encouragement she\u2019d received from other men and women married to alcoholics, she didn\u2019t know where she\u2019d be today. It forever changed her life. She\u2019d stepped back and stopped protecting Bob from the consequences of his addiction. If he drove drunk, she phoned the police; if he fell down on the floor too drunk to get up, she left him there. His drinking was his problem and she refused to make it hers, refused to be caught in the eye of a hurricane because he chose to hide his sorrows in booze.</p><p>Thankfully, after Bob had been fired by the third plumbing contractor in a row, gotten his car insurance canceled only to be renewed at rates that rivaled a house payment and been called before a judge, his head started to clear. Then and only then did the light dawn. He\u2019d gone to his first AA meeting and by the grace of God, hadn\u2019t touched a drop since.</p><p>Shortly after he\u2019d achieved three weeks of sobriety, he came to her and told her everything that had happened one terrible day in Vietnam. He\u2019d wept bitter tears of guilt and self-recrimination as she held him and cried with him. She\u2019d marked the date he sobbed out his story on her heart, because it was that day their lives and their marriage had changed. It was that day she knew Bob had the power to stop drinking. That had been twenty years ago now, in January 1983. He\u2019d helped many an alcoholic through the AA program since then, and she continued to attend Al-Anon.</p><p>As Peggy came into the kitchen, Bob smiled at her. He had the Alcoholics Anonymous Big Book in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been up?\u201d she asked. Since he was already dressed and shaved, it must\u2019ve been a while.</p><p>\u201cA few hours. I have an appointment with Roy this morning. I wouldn\u2019t mind company if you\u2019d care to tag along.\u201d</p><p>Although he tossed out the invitation in an offhand manner, Peggy knew her husband well enough to realize he wanted her with him. He\u2019d been nervous for days. Ever since Troy Davis had come by the house.</p><p>The local sheriff had asked Bob a few questions regarding the John Doe who\u2019d died in their home. As far as she could tell, they were the same questions he\u2019d asked months earlier, when the body was discovered. Troy didn\u2019t stay long, but afterward Bob had paced the house for hours until Peggy thought she\u2019d go mad if he didn\u2019t sit down.</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll go,\u201d she told him as she poured a cup of coffee. The pot was nearly empty, and she started a fresh one. They had no guests at the moment, but extra coffee never went amiss.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we might get snow,\u201d her husband said, staring out the window.</p><p>Peggy sat down across from him and reached for the remote control. They kept a small TV in the kitchen, where she generally watched the morning newscast from the local Seattle station. There\u2019d been rumors of snow all week, but only now had the temperature descended to the point that it was a possibility.</p><p>Snow in the Puget Sound area wasn\u2019t a common occurrence. Contrary to popular belief, Seattle and its outlying regions actually had a moderate climate. As long as records had been maintained, it had never gone over a hundred degrees in summer or below zero in winter.</p><p>\u201cI hope it does snow,\u201d Peggy said, thinking how the schoolkids would love it. As a matter of fact, so would she. The Christmas lights were up outside, the wreath hung on the door and the illuminated family of deer stood in the middle of their front yard. Snow would be the perfect complement.</p><p>Bob closed his Big Book and yawned loudly.</p><p>\u201cWhat time did you get up?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cEarly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo? Three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround there,\u201d he agreed, settling his gaze on the television screen.</p><p>Peggy suspected it might\u2019ve been even earlier. Her husband couldn\u2019t get the notion out of his head that he knew the dead stranger. The John Doe had received extensive plastic surgery, which certainly complicated the process of identifying him. For a while, there\u2019d been speculation that it might be Dan Sherman, but that had turned out not to be the case, since Dan\u2019s body was found a few weeks later. All this death in Cedar Cove\u2014it was hard to reconcile in such a friendly, sleepy town.</p><p>\u201cWhat time\u2019s your appointment?\u201d Peggy asked.</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready,\u201d she promised him.</p><p>A few hours later, Bob and Peggy arrived at Roy McAfee\u2019s office not far from the Harbor Street Art Gallery. Corrie, Roy\u2019s wife, acted as his secretary. Peggy liked Corrie, although she didn\u2019t know her well. Roy was a no-nonsense man, a stolid, Detective Friday kind of investigator who tracked down the facts. The similarity between Roy and Joe Friday from the old Dragnet TV show reassured Peggy. He was a bit distant, an observer, a man who didn\u2019t allow emotion to cloud an investigation. Corrie was just the opposite, warm and outgoing. Even though she now worked for her husband, she appeared to be the stay-at-home-and-bake-cookies type of wife and mother. Peggy suspected that was the reason she\u2019d been drawn to Corrie. They were a lot alike. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they sat in the reception room, Peggy picked up an old issue of Readers\u2019 Digest and Bob jiggled his foot incessantly. It was all she could do not to reach over and stop him.</p><p>\u201cRoy can see you now,\u201d Corrie announced, holding open the door.</p><p>Peggy looked at her husband, silently wondering if he wanted her to go in with him.</p><p>\u201cNot right now.\u201d Bob shook his head. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to talk to Roy alone, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d gone pale, she noted. \u201cOf course. Whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>Bob walked into the room and closed the door. Peggy gazed anxiously after him. She didn\u2019t know what he was going to ask Roy, or if he had anything he needed to hide.</p><p>Now it was Peggy who did the pacing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always meant to ask you about your herb garden,\u201d Corrie said from behind her desk. \u201cHow did you get started?\u201d</p><p>Peggy folded her arms and looked out the office window, onto Harbor Street. \u201cBy accident, actually. Years ago we bought a house that had a rosemary bush and I loved the scent of it. I clipped branches from it so often that I soon bought a second plant and then a third. Before I knew it, I was buying bay and sage and basil. I found out that I have a knack for growing herbs. When we decided to move back to Cedar Cove\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you lived here earlier?\u201d</p><p>Peggy nodded. \u201cBob and I both graduated from Cedar Cove High School. Bob was in the class of 1966 and I graduated two years later in \u201968.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re close to the same age,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cI\u2019m forty-seven and Roy is fifty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a herb garden?\u201d Peggy asked.</p><p>Corrie shook her head. \u201cNo, but I\u2019d like one. Any suggestions?\u201d</p><p>Peggy recognized that Corrie was distracting her, but she didn\u2019t mind. The other woman seemed genuinely interested in learning about herbs. \u201cCome visit anytime,\u201d Peggy invited. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a few plants to start off with in the spring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love that,\u201d Corrie told her.</p><p>\u201cBob planted the blueberries.\u201d Now that she was talking, Peggy couldn\u2019t seem to stop. \u201cWe have our own small patch at the side of the house. They need lots of water and it\u2019s a struggle to keep the deer out of them.\u201d</p><p>They must have talked for twenty minutes about recipes, especially ones with blueberries. Peggy stopped abruptly when the door opened and Roy stuck his head out.</p><p>\u201cPeggy, would you join us?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and walked into the room on shaky legs. Claiming the empty chair next to her husband, she reached for Bob\u2019s hand. His fingers tightened around hers.</p><p>\u201cI told Roy what happened in Nam,\u201d Bob said, his voice low and emotional. \u201cI told him there were four of us, all under twenty-five. We made a pact never to talk about it. I don\u2019t know if our John Doe has anything to do with this, but I\u2019ve asked Roy to find out what he can.\u201d</p><p>On the night twenty years earlier, when Bob had described that day in the jungle, he\u2019d vowed never to speak of it again. Telling her had been a one-time thing, an act of self-preservation. The burden of carrying his secret had nearly destroyed him and their marriage.</p><p>\u201cDan Sherman was with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDan?\u201d Peggy gasped. He\u2019d never told her his high school friend had been in that hellish fight until now.</p><p>Peggy turned her attention to Roy. \u201cDo you think what happened in Nam has anything to do with the man who died in our home?\u201d</p><p>Roy leaned forward, his expression serious. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I intend to find out.\u201d</p><p>The festive atmosphere in the halls of Kitsap County Courthouse was contagious. Olivia looked out the window of her chamber office, delighted to see it was snowing. Snow in December was perfect. It made her want to rush home and bake gingerbread cookies and string popcorn. Instead she had to listen while lawyers stated their cases and awaited her decision.</p><p>Finishing her tea, she reluctantly went back to the courtroom. The bailiff announced her arrival and those congregated halfheartedly rose to their feet as she took her place behind the bench.</p><p>The next case was called, and the first attorney stepped forward. Olivia glanced up and to her surprise, discovered Jack Griffin sitting in the back of the room, pen and pad in hand. He was already taking notes, and she hadn\u2019t listened to a single case yet. Either he was in court on legitimate business, or he\u2019d come to rile her. She felt her heart pound hard against her ribs.</p><p>But whatever his reason for being there, a few moments into the case, Jack stood and made his way out of the courtroom. Olivia was disappointed; they\u2019d hardly seen each other in weeks. He was busy, she was busy, and despite effort on both their parts, their relationship hadn\u2019t returned to the closeness they used to share. Damn it all, she missed Jack. Missed the fun they\u2019d had together, his merciless teasing, his potent kisses. A woman her age shouldn\u2019t be thinking about such things in the middle of a custody case, but Olivia couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>She wanted him back in her life, and she longed for their relationship to be what it had once been. She didn\u2019t know who was the guilty party, she or Jack. A year earlier they\u2019d had dinner together at least twice a week. Jack regularly came to the house on Tuesday nights and they\u2019d watch crime shows on the Discovery channel. She hadn\u2019t seen him on a Tuesday night in months.</p><p>All of that was before his son had moved in with him, she remembered. Eric\u2019s presence had certainly turned Jack\u2019s world upside down, but he felt he owed this time to his son, so Olivia had graciously taken a back seat. She didn\u2019t like it, but there\u2019d been no choice.</p><p>Eric was married now\u2014she\u2019d performed the ceremony herself\u2014and the father of twins. Last summer Eric, Shelly and the babies had moved to Reno, Nevada.</p><p>Just when it looked as if life might return to normal, Stan had entered the scene. She\u2019d give him credit; her ex-husband was persistent. He phoned her ten times more often than Jack did. She could have a date with Stan anytime if she was interested. But she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Oh, she might\u2019ve been, in the beginning. There was something so emotionally satisfying about her ex-husband admitting he\u2019d made a terrible mistake in divorcing her. For a brief period, her ego had been comforted by it and she\u2019d come close to letting those righteous emotions sway her. Luckily, common sense had convinced her otherwise.</p><p>Olivia was sincere in what she told her ex-husband. Stan needed a woman in his life and he wasn\u2019t afraid of a challenge. The problem was, he viewed her as a challenge. Of course, any woman Stan wanted would have to be adoring. Intelligence wasn\u2019t a requirement, although it was a bonus. No question, Stan Lockhart was witty and possessed a high IQ. His emotional IQ, sadly, was far lower.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon passed quickly as Olivia dealt with a series of family court cases, one after the other until they blurred in her mind. By the time court adjourned for the day, she was ready to go home and read recipes for gingerbread cookies.</p><p>As she peeled off her robe, she checked her phone messages. There was one from Stan\u2014no real surprise\u2014and another from her daughter. Justine was a stay-at-home mother now, although she continued to manage the finances at the restaurant. She paid the bills and took care of the payroll. But when it came to the complicated tax laws, Justine was smart enough to leave those in the hands of Zachary Cox, her capable accountant.</p><p>Olivia returned the calls, and after short conversations with both\u2014\u201cno, thanks\u201d to Stan on the dinner invite, and yes, it\u2019s best to use brandy in Julia Child\u2019s fruitcake recipe with Justine\u2014she prepared to leave the courthouse.</p><p>She pulled on her coat and gloves and stepped out of her office to discover Jack waiting for her, leaning against the wall. He grinned sheepishly when she appeared.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, straightening.</p><p>\u201cHi yourself.\u201d Her heart skipped a beat at the sight of him. Jack wasn\u2019t a handsome man at first glance, but he did manage to stir her restless heart.</p><p>\u201cDo you have time for a walk in the snow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d She\u2019d been in a hurry to get home, but invitations from Jack were scarce and she wasn\u2019t about to refuse one.</p><p>He brightened, smiling that cocky off-center grin of his. \u201cI thought you might.\u201d</p><p>Once outside, she noticed that the snow was coming down in large, soft flakes, the kind that floated slowly to earth.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s walk down to the waterfront,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>The hill was steep and the street was often closed when driving conditions were unsafe. The signs had already been set in place not far from the courthouse.</p><p>Jack tucked her hand in the crook of his arm. Olivia turned her face to the sky and opened her mouth to catch the falling snow on her tongue, the way she\u2019d done as a child.</p><p>\u201cI love when it snows,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to build a snowman on the courthouse lawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather we went somewhere for a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>That sounded just as nice to Olivia. The lights from the marina were ablaze, the water catching their reflection as dusk settled over the cove. Boats bobbed gently on the surface, and with the snow drifting down, the scene resembled a Christmas card. The only thing missing was carolers walking by in old-fashioned winter coats or a sleigh gliding past.</p><p>Jack led her to the Pot Belly Deli on Harbor Street. The deli served a big lunch crowd, but stayed open until late afternoon. He went up to the counter while she chose a table by the window. Soon Jack returned with two thick mugs of coffee and a slice of pecan pie with two forks.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m watching my weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch it another time,\u201d he said, and handed her a fork.</p><p>She accepted it, sighing heavily. \u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him a chance to answer. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to walk on the treadmill tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you did aerobics with Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, but that\u2019s Wednesday nights, once a week. Everything I\u2019ve read about exercise says four or five times a week is best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat often, huh...?\u201d He sliced off a section of pie with the side of his fork.</p><p>\u201cDo you exercise, Jack?\u201d She had helped herself to the tiniest bit of pie, avoiding the whipped cream.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d He glanced up and the guilty look he wore was answer enough.</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, if you don\u2019t take care of yourself you\u2019re going to keel over from a heart attack. You need to get serious about eating right and exercising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mother,\u201d he said, and hacked off another chunk of pie.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m finished lecturing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He smiled as he said it, taking the sting from his words. He reached inside his coat pocket and removed an envelope. \u201cI thought you might like to see these.\u201d</p><p>Olivia took the envelope and noticed the return address. It was from Eric and Shelly. Inside was a letter wrapped around a set of pictures. Olivia unfolded the letter and studied the snapshots of Tedd and Todd, Eric\u2019s twin sons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Jack! Look how much they\u2019ve grown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShelly wrote and said they\u2019re both walking already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt nine months?\u201d Olivia could well imagine all the mischief those boys were getting into. She didn\u2019t envy the young couple. Thankfully, Jordan and Justine hadn\u2019t walked until they were a year old. A brief sorrow, a pang of regret, came and went. She didn\u2019t think about Jordan as much anymore. Whole days would pass without her dwelling on the death of her thirteen-year-old son, Justine\u2019s twin brother. For years she\u2019d played a heart-wrenching game of wondering how her life would\u2019ve been different if Jordan had chosen to ride his bike that fateful August afternoon instead of heading to the lake with his friends. It was a question with no answer. Jordan had gone to the lake.</p><p>\u201cI have new pictures of Isabella,\u201d she said, unwilling to be outdone in the grandchild department. She scooped up her purse and removed a small \u201cbrag\u201d book Grace had given her for pictures. \u201cLook at Leif, too. You won\u2019t believe how much he\u2019s changed.\u201d</p> <p>While she finished studying the snapshots of Tedd and Todd, Jack flipped through the photo book.</p><p>\u201cIsabella and Leif are cute,\u201d Jack agreed, \u201cbut Tedd and Todd are cuter.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Olivia lowered the snapshots. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there, Jack Griffin. My grandchildren are the most perfect, beautiful grandchildren in the entire universe. I\u2019d hate to slap a fine on you for denying the truth.\u201d</p><p>He sat back and arched his eyebrows. \u201cReally? I could always write another article about you in The Chronicle,\u201d he returned.</p><p>Olivia laughed. \u201cTruce, truce. Let\u2019s agree we both have the brightest, most intelligent grandchildren ever to grace the earth. Deal?\u201d</p> <p>Jack smiled and reached for his fork. Only this bite was for her.</p><p>She declined with a shake of her head, but Jack was having none of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to work it off later and I hate the treadmill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could always go walking.\u201d</p><p>However, by now it\u2019d stopped snowing and a light drizzle had started. \u201cIn the rain?\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cHow about if you take me Christmas shopping? I need to mail off gifts for Eric, Shelly and the boys, and I could use the help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she agreed, and leaned forward to accept the sliver of pie. It really did taste divine and she closed her eyes to savor this small bite.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d he asked, sipping his coffee.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d She stood, picking up her coat, which was draped on the chair behind her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were on their way out the door that Olivia realized this was the first time in months that Stan\u2019s silent presence hadn\u2019t loomed over them.</p><p>This was a good sign, a very good sign indeed.</p><p>Zach studied the young woman in the chair opposite his desk. This was the part of the job he detested most. Hiring new employees. Cecilia Randall was the last applicant of the day. He\u2019d interviewed four others and had found some reason or other not to hire any of them.</p><p>Cecilia Randall was nervous, eager to make a good impression. She was young, but she\u2019d come with glowing references, although none were from bookkeeping firms. Her work experience so far had been as a restaurant hostess.</p><p>A dozen questions filled his mind, but federal regulations being what they were, Zach couldn\u2019t ask them. He\u2019d learned his lesson on that issue with Janice Lamond.</p> <p>\u201cYou like accounting work, Ms. Randall?\u201d he asked, clearing his throat.</p><p>She nodded vigorously. \u201cVery much. I had top marks in my class.\u201d She leaned forward and motioned to an entry at the bottom of her r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \u201cI recently earned my accounting degree from Olympic Community College in Bremerton.\u201d</p><p>Zach had noticed that. \u201cI see your husband\u2019s in the navy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s correct. He\u2019s currently out at sea.\u201d She clasped her hands in her lap and squeezed her fingers tightly together. \u201cI miss him very much, but his tour of duty is almost over.\u201d She had the wistful look of a woman in love. That was good.</p><p>Zach glanced over her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 one final time and mentioned his main objection. \u201cI don\u2019t see any previous employment in this field.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia moved to the edge of her seat. \u201cYes, I know. Until recently I worked at The Captain\u2019s Galley as a hostess. That was before it was sold. It\u2019s The Lighthouse now.\u201d</p><p>Zach nodded absently; he was certainly familiar with the restaurant, since he did their taxes.</p><p>Cecilia leaned closer. \u201cThey offered me a job, but I turned it down. Ian and I felt it was more important for me to finish my degree and get a job in the field I\u2019ve been training in for the last three years.\u201d</p><p>He gave her an A for effort, Zach decided. She\u2019d stuck out three years of classes and here she was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to start at the bottom,\u201d she offered. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful for the experience and the chance to prove myself.\u201d</p><p>Zach liked this young navy wife. Another good thing\u2014she was married and from every indication the marriage was healthy. Although he\u2019d never admit it, he didn\u2019t want to work in close proximity to a single woman again. He hadn\u2019t seen Janice for what she was until the damage was done.</p><p>\u201cCan you start Monday morning?\u201d he asked, making his decision. He was tired of doing interviews, and no other applicant had shown as much desire for the job as Cecilia Randall.</p><p>Her eyes grew huge. \u201cYou mean I\u2019ve got the job?\u201d</p><p>Zach smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours.\u201d He told her the salary and her eyes grew even bigger. He was afraid it wasn\u2019t enough when she blurted out, \u201cHow much?\u201d Embarrassed, she laughed and covered her mouth. \u201cThis is just great! You won\u2019t be sorry, Mr. Cox. I\u2019ll work hard and do my very best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will, Ms. Randall.\u201d</p><p>After he left the office that evening, Zach stopped at the local grocery and picked up a whole cooked chicken. It had never been one of his favorite dinners, but it was quick and easy and he didn\u2019t feel like fussing with meal preparation.</p><p>Eddie\u2019s face fell when he saw it. \u201cI wanted spaghetti,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cChicken again?\u201d Allison said. \u201cMom brought home a chicken two nights ago. Doesn\u2019t anyone in this family know how to cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Zach said, losing his patience. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Allison snarled back at him. \u201cWhat makes you think I can cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you take home economics this trimester?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we\u2019re not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get home first in the afternoon\u2014you can put on dinner for Eddie and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to cook just because I\u2019m a girl, don\u2019t you?\u201d Her eyes filled with fiery indignation.</p><p>Zach wasn\u2019t about to get caught in the \u201cMy Dad is a Chauvinist\u201d trap. \u201cIf Eddie was home from school before you, I\u2019d put him in change of dinner, but as it happens, you\u2019re the first one to walk in the door. Congratulations, you\u2019re elected. Your brother and I will wash the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather cook,\u201d Eddie piped up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re out of luck, sport. Allison\u2019s going to come up with a dinner plan for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dinner plan?\u201d She looked aghast. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He wondered if she\u2019d been sleeping through her classes. \u201cMake a list of what we\u2019re going to eat for the next seven days and then compile a grocery list from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can cook spaghetti every night if you want to, Allison,\u201d Eddie said enthusiastically.</p><p>\u201cHere, write.\u201d Zach set a notebook on the table in front of her.</p><p>\u201cCan we have tacos one night?\u201d Eddie begged. \u201cPlease, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Allison reluctantly wrote tacos at the top of her list.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we need for tacos?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>\u201cMeat, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and taco shells,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Zach said, pointing at her. \u201cWrite all that down on a separate shopping list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have cheese,\u201d Eddie told him. \u201cMom bought it for macaroni and cheese on Monday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but we need taco shells, tomatoes and lettuce.\u201d</p><p>Allison dutifully listed the ingredients. They continued, with Eddie making dinner suggestions and Allison creating the list. Actually it was fun, and by the time they\u2019d finished, the table was set and they were ready for dinner.</p><p>Eddie held a chicken leg with both hands. \u201cAre you really going to cook for us, Allison?\u201d he asked his sister.</p><p>Allison shrugged. \u201cOnly because Dad\u2019s making me.\u201d</p><p>In an effort to bring family discussions back to the dinner table, Zach asked his two children about their days.</p><p>In typical Allison fashion, she rolled her eyes. \u201cAll right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a great day,\u201d Eddie said, describing in detail every aspect of his fifth-grade life.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Allison asked when Eddie had finished.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Zach replied, and then realized he didn\u2019t have anything to hide. \u201cI hired a new assistant this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she pretty?\u201d Eddie asked.</p><p>Before he could answer, the phone rang, and like a comic strip hero in a mask and cape, Allison dove for the phone. Her enthusiasm died when she discovered it was her mother.</p><p>Although Zach could only hear one side of the conversation, it was obvious from Allison\u2019s answer that Rosie had asked what they were doing.</p><p>His daughter gave a long, beleaguered sigh. \u201cWe\u2019re just sitting around the dinner table and Dad\u2019s telling us about hiring a new assistant.\u201d</p><p>Zach wanted to groan aloud. He\u2019d rather Rosie didn\u2019t know that Janice had quit and left him high and dry. The fact that she\u2019d handed in her notice was embarrassing enough. But to own up to the poor choice he\u2019d made when he\u2019d hired her\u2014to Rosie of all people\u2014would be mortifying. It\u2019d been hard enough to admit it to himself.</p><p>His appetite gone, Zach stood and carried his plate to the kitchen. He scraped it off and set it inside the dishwasher.</p><p>Eddie talked to his mother, too, and after a few minutes, his son called him. \u201cMom wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure.\u201d He knew she wasn\u2019t going to let the information slide, and he was right.</p><p>The moment he was on the phone, Rosie asked the question he\u2019d been expecting. \u201cYou\u2019re hiring a new assistant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I guess Allison told you,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get back to family discussions over the dinner table\u2014all of us sharing part of our day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Janice Lamond?\u201d</p><p>She was certainly persistent. \u201cNothing\u2019s happened to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why are you hiring another assistant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he repeated as if the answer should be obvious. \u201cI need one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJanice got a promotion, didn\u2019t she?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zach could say that in all honesty. Janice had gotten a promotion\u2014only it hadn\u2019t been with his firm. He knew very well that he should admit Janice had been everything Rosie believed. She\u2019d had an agenda that had nothing to do with the job.</p><p>\u201cI guess congratulations are in order, then\u2014for Janice, that is.\u201d Rosie sounded deflated.</p><p>\u201cYes...I suppose they are,\u201d he said.</p><p>A few moments later, Zach hung up the phone. An uneasy sensation settled over him. He had an inkling that he was going to end up paying for this lie\u2014and soon.</p> <p>Fifteen</p><p>Something was wrong with Jon. Maryellen had been thinking about his strange behavior ever since he\u2019d come to collect Katie the night before. Monday morning, as she pulled into the parking lot at the gallery, her troubled thoughts stayed with her. Harbor Street, which curved around the cove, was bright with Christmas lights arched over the street, and the traditional candy cane displays were suspended in a festive arrangement from the light posts.</p><p>Jon was wonderful with Katie, but lately he didn\u2019t linger for more than a minute or two when he was picking her up. He\u2019d even announced that he planned to drop Katie off at Kelly\u2019s house rather than at Maryellen\u2019s.</p><p>Until recently, Jon seemed to invent excuses to spend time with her, but now everything had changed. The only reason she could imagine was that he was involved with someone else. The possibility brought with it a curious ache, an unfamiliar distress. Maryellen feared this emotion was jealousy, and she hated the way it made her feel.</p><p>By midmorning, she had to know. The first person she asked for advice was her sister. In the first free moment she had between cusomers she called Kelly, who answered right away.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d Maryellen said, forcing a cheerful note into her voice. \u201cI just wanted to make sure Katie\u2019s with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is. Jon dropped her off an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She strove to maintain a casual tone, although her curiosity was killing her. \u201cHow did he seem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon? No different than any other time I\u2019ve seen him. He came with Katie, spent a few minutes, exchanged high fives with Tyler and then was out the door. Any reason?\u201d</p><p>Ten responses popped into her mind. \u201cHe...he seems different these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent? How do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>Maryellen pressed the phone tighter to her ear. She didn\u2019t want to admit he didn\u2019t seem interested in her anymore, especially since that wasn\u2019t even supposed to matter.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem odd that Jon wants to drop Katie off at your house instead of mine?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kelly was nothing if not direct. \u201cIt makes sense. If he brings Katie back to you, he has to leave his place by seven-fifteen. If he drops Katie off at my place, he can sleep in and arrive any time he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Naturally her sister would say something completely reasonable and make Maryellen feel all the more ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cWhy else would he do it?\u201d Kelly asked.</p><p>Maryellen hated to sound paranoid, but her concern had more to do with what she sensed about him than anything he\u2019d said or done. \u201cHe...when he came by to pick up Katie yesterday afternoon, he didn\u2019t stay a second longer than necessary.\u201d</p><p>Kelly sighed. \u201cPerhaps he had plans. He does have a life, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that.\u201d Her sister didn\u2019t understand. Jon always used to visit, sometimes for as much as an hour, but not anymore.</p> <p>The sad part was that Maryellen had come to anticipate his company. She enjoyed their conversations. When he\u2019d left so quickly on Sunday, she\u2019d moped around the house, not knowing what to make of this sudden change in their routine.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re truly bothered, you should ask him,\u201d Kelly advised.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that!\u201d Her sister meant well, but Maryellen couldn\u2019t pry into Jon\u2019s life. After all, she was the one who\u2019d spurned him.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask him indirectly,\u201d Kelly suggested next.</p><p>Maryellen hadn\u2019t dated since her divorce; she was seriously lacking in social finesse when it came to dealing with men. She wished she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, just ask him,\u201d Kelly said.</p><p>Kelly was sounding impatient, so Maryellen ended the call. \u201cOkay, I will,\u201d she promised.</p><p>She replaced the receiver and thought about what her sister had said\u2014that she could find out what she needed to know by asking indirectly. That was an idea.</p><p>Of course, she could always talk to Justine. She and Seth owned the restaurant where Jon was employed as head chef. They were casual friends, and they\u2019d both had babies during the summer. It would seem perfectly natural to inquire about the restaurant\u2014and Jon. Still, it struck her as an underhanded means of acquiring information.</p><p>Perhaps Kelly was right. She should simply ask Jon.</p><p>Maryellen mulled over how to broach the subject with him and not sound paranoid or interfering. Two days later, she landed on an idea. She\u2019d ask Jon to join her and her family for Christmas. This would be Katie\u2019s first Christmas, and it seemed a shame to be shuffling their daughter back and forth over the holiday. They could all spend the day together. It was a reasonable suggestion, and his answer would tell her everything she needed to know.</p><p>Maryellen bided her time. She waited another week, until Jon was scheduled to pick up Katie again. When he phoned to make the arrangements, she suggested they meet at the waterfront park. It was a bright, beautiful day and the small gazebo had a live Nativity scene. The local Methodist church routinely set this up; church members took turns playing the roles of Mary and Joseph, with live farm animals.</p><p>Jon was waiting for her when she arrived, standing away from the spectators, his camera around his neck. He leaned against the railing and straightened when he saw her approach.</p><p>She raised her hand and waved, and increased her pace as she pushed the stroller toward him. Katie was sound asleep, the diaper bag tucked in the rear of the stroller.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting used to seeing you with shorter hair,\u201d he said, and his gaze lingered on Maryellen for an extra moment, or so it seemed. \u201cYou look nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d This was going better than she\u2019d expected. She felt the warmth in his eyes and it reassured her. \u201cYou look good yourself,\u201d she said, recovering quickly.</p><p>He shrugged. He reached for the stroller handles; apparently he was ready to leave. Maryellen\u2019s heart dropped. It was too soon.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a few minutes?\u201d she asked, and started to walk slowly down the path that wandered along the waterfront toward the marina. Many of the sailboats had decorated their masts with bright Christmas lights. In the summer, this area around the waterfront was filled with booths and stands\u2014a local farmers\u2019 market. At other times the paved area by the gazebo was a large parking lot.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jon said, matching his steps to hers as he pushed the stroller.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d she said, hesitating as her heart began to race. It might be silly to feel this way, but she was nervous and on edge.</p><p>At her pause, Jon turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cAbout Christmas,\u201d she added. \u201cI was thinking about the two of us sharing Katie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take her Christmas Eve and you could have her Christmas Day,\u201d Jon suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve certainly been flexible with the schedule,\u201d she said appreciatively. In almost every instance, Jon had been agreeable about the schedule alterations she\u2019d required. \u201cBut my thought was that you might like to spend Christmas with Katie and me and my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not have her Christmas Eve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014no, you could take her then if you wanted, but this is in addition to Christmas Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to join you for Christmas?\u201d His voice was surprised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it very much if you could come for the day.\u201d She smiled shyly at him. She was shocked by the depth of her desire, shocked by how badly she wanted him with her and Katie.</p><p>For a moment, it seemed as if he was pleased by her invitation. Then, for no reason she could decipher, his grin faded and he turned away from her, physically as well as emotionally. \u201cI appreciate the invite, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...can\u2019t?\u201d Maryellen didn\u2019t bother to hide her disappointment, although she attempted to swallow her hurt.</p><p>\u201cI have other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Well, she had her answer, but it wasn\u2019t one she liked. Jon had met someone else. She was sure of it now. \u201cI should\u2019ve invited you earlier, I guess,\u201d she said, recovering quickly. \u201cPerhaps we can get together next Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said, without committing himself.</p><p>Soon afterward, Jon made an excuse and left with Katie. Maryellen walked numbly along the waterfront. She felt rejected and dismayed and upset.</p><p>Not wanting to return to an empty house, she drove to her mother\u2019s place on Rosewood Lane. This was the home where Maryellen had grown up. She loved this old house with the big dormer and the old-fashioned front porch. As a teenager, she\u2019d spent many evenings sitting on those steps.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s car was parked in the garage, with the door left open. Buttercup was outside and barked when she eased to a stop in the driveway. As soon as the golden retriever recognized her, she wagged her tail in greeting. Maryellen stroked the dog\u2019s head and spoke a few words to her mother\u2019s companion, then knocked at the kitchen door and let herself in.</p><p>Grace sat at the computer, intently studying the screen when Maryellen entered.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she said in a dejected voice.</p><p>Grace spun around, her eyes wide. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just walked in. I knocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a moment.\u201d Her mother turned back to the computer and frantically typed something. Then she closed it down, stood and came into the kitchen, where Maryellen sat at the table.</p><p>\u201cSo, what brings you?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>She was behaving a bit strangely, Maryellen thought, frowning. It was almost as if she\u2019d stumbled upon her mother doing something illegal. Whatever it was, Grace had guilty written all over her. If she hadn\u2019t been so absorbed in her own troubles, Maryellen would have pursued the matter.</p><p>\u201cMom, I think Jon\u2019s got a girlfriend,\u201d she blurted out, and realized immediately how juvenile that sounded.</p><p>Her mother reached for the teakettle and filled it with tap water. \u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just know. He\u2019s avoiding me.\u201d She tried to figure out how long this had been going on and couldn\u2019t remember. \u201cI invited him to spend Christmas with me and Katie and the rest of the family. He declined, said he had other plans.\u201d</p><p>Grace sat down at the kitchen table and studied her. \u201cI have a question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d What Maryellen wanted just then was advice and comfort, not questions.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I care?\u201d she repeated, faltering over the words. \u201cWhy do I care?\u201d she repeated. \u201cWell...because I just do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou were the one who insisted you didn\u2019t want Jon in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she blurted out, and knew it was a lie. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she amended, \u201cbut I\u2019ve had a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be the problem,\u201d her mother said. She got up as the water started to boil.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe Jon\u2019s had a change of heart himself.\u201d</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>With only a few days left before Christmas, Corrie McAfee was eager to finish the last of her shopping. She\u2019d assumed that when Roy took early retirement from the Seattle police force they\u2019d travel. Touring Europe was something they\u2019d talked about for years.</p><p>Retirement had sounded so liberating. No alarm clocks; a come-and-go-as-you-please kind of lifestyle. It had been that way at first, but Roy had gone stir-crazy within eighteen months. Shortly after their arrival in Cedar Cove, he\u2019d hung out his shingle as a private investigator.</p><p>Linnette, their twenty-four-year-old daughter, had predicted as much. The older of their two children, she was most like her father. She shared Roy\u2019s insight into people; they both possessed an innate ability to read character and see through pretense. Linnette also had a genuine desire to help people, especially children. In fact, she was receiving her physician\u2019s assistant degree in June. She\u2019d be arriving for the holidays on Wednesday afternoon, and joining Corrie and Roy for the Christmas Eve worship service at church.</p> <p>Mack was coming to Cedar Cove, too, but their son wouldn\u2019t get there until Christmas morning. Mack was a mailman in the Seattle area. He\u2019d never enjoyed school or succeeded at it the way his sister had. Corrie believed that, in time, he\u2019d decide to further his education, but if he didn\u2019t, that was fine, too. He was generous, hard-working and honest. Roy, however, had bigger aspirations for his only son, and it had caused a rift between him and Mack. A small one they both chose to ignore, but they weren\u2019t close, and that troubled Corrie.</p><p>\u201cAre you going out?\u201d Roy asked as he left his office and found her wearing her coat.</p><p>\u201cPeggy and I are meeting for lunch,\u201d she told him. \u201cThen we\u2019re off to the mall.\u201d</p><p>Her husband leaned against her desk in a relaxed pose. \u201cYou like Peggy, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Corrie nodded. They\u2019d lived in Cedar Cove nearly four years now and hadn\u2019t established a lot of friendships. In the beginning, Corrie had been busy setting up their home. Later she was involved with helping Roy establish the agency. There\u2019d been overtures of friendship from their neighbors, but Corrie and Roy tended to keep to themselves. That was how it had been in Seattle, and they\u2019d maintained the same approach here. They waved to the neighbors, collected their mail while they were on vacation, but that was about the extent of it.</p><p>Peggy Beldon, however, was someone who genuinely interested Corrie, for a number of reasons. Corrie had a small garden space at the back of their property. Her yard in Seattle had been shaded and too small for anything other than a few flowers. After seeing Peggy\u2019s herb garden, she wanted to plant her own. But Corrie liked Peggy for more than her gardening expertise.</p> <p>The day Bob came into the office and Corrie had chatted with Peggy, the other woman had graciously offered Corrie a few seedlings. That was the beginning of their friendship. Twice now, they\u2019d met for lunch to chat, exchange recipes and get to know each other. Both times Corrie had come away with the feeling that she\u2019d made a friend.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I take the time off, do you?\u201d she asked. Her question was a polite formality, since Roy had encouraged the friendship.</p><p>Her husband shook his head. \u201cBy all means, tackle the mall. You\u2019re braver than I am by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any appointments this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her absently. Corrie knew him well enough to realize his mind had drifted in another direction altogether. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Roy continued to stare into space.</p><p>\u201cRoy?\u201d</p><p>He frowned, and it was clear he hadn\u2019t even heard her the first time. Roy was like this. His thoughts would venture off onto some case and it\u2019d be practically impossible to get his attention.</p> <p>\u201cIs it the mystery man again?\u201d she asked. She knew that some part of his brain refused to let this lie. He needed answers, resolution. It was one of the reasons he\u2019d advanced quickly through the ranks of the Seattle Police Department to become a detective, a position he\u2019d held for most of his career.</p><p>\u201cYou want my opinion?\u201d she said.</p><p>Roy grinned. \u201cI have a feeling you\u2019re going to give it to me, anyway, so why not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect this John Doe was lost and looking for a place to stay. You and I both know there are only a couple of motels in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth are off the Interstate,\u201d Roy reminded her.</p><p>\u201cSo he took an early exit and got lost. That\u2019s easy enough to do,\u201d Corrie reasoned. \u201cRemember the first time we drove to Cedar Cove?\u201d If he didn\u2019t remember, she certainly did. They\u2019d driven across the Narrows Bridge on a sunny Sunday afternoon, searching out areas in Puget Sound where their retirement income would match the cost of living.</p><p>Corrie had been reading the map and become confused. Consequently, Roy had exited the freeway too soon and they\u2019d found themselves in what was primarily a rural area. They\u2019d driven past small farms and horse ranches and then along stretches of undeveloped waterfront. They\u2019d both grown excited when they realized property values were fifty percent less than they were across the water.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Roy said. \u201cBut if that was the case, the mystery man would\u2019ve had to travel a long way in the dark, on unfamiliar roads, and then he just stumbled onto the Beldons\u2019 bed-and-breakfast.\u201d He rubbed his jaw. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible. With the renaming of some streets, anyone, especially a visitor, could get confused.\u201d Part of Lighthouse Road, on the other side of Harbor Street, was now called Cranberry Point.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Roy had a point. The Thyme and Tide wasn\u2019t on the beaten path and was miles away from the exit she\u2019d mentioned.</p><p>\u201cSo much of his visit to town doesn\u2019t add up,\u201d Roy muttered. \u201cThe fact that he had plastic surgery has bothered me from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the coroner said it looked like the guy had some kind of accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Roy said, \u201cbut Bob said there was something vaguely familiar about him. I keep thinking about that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it go,\u201d she urged. \u201cIt\u2019s almost Christmas.\u201d If Roy took a break from the case, he might free his mind to explore solutions. It often happened like that; a case would lie fallow for months and then overnight a small piece of evidence her husband had found months earlier\u2014a bit of conversation, a previously unrelated detail\u2014would suddenly click into place. Soon afterward, he\u2019d have the answers he needed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that just yet,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few feelers out.\u201d</p><p>Corrie nearly groaned. The problem was, once Roy asked for favors, he owed just as many in return. It all depended on whom he\u2019d contacted and why. \u201cWhat sort of feelers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to worry, most of it can be done over the Internet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost Christmas,\u201d she reminded him again. For once, she wanted him to simply enjoy the holiday and stop thinking about work.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed mildly.</p><p>\u201cOur children will be home soon, and it\u2019s important that we spend time as a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I want you to remember there\u2019s another family somewhere who\u2019s missing a father this Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Corrie had remained emotionally detached from the man who\u2019d turned up dead at the Beldons\u2019 B and B. He was a stranger who\u2019d chosen to carry false identification. Nothing was known about him or his reasons for being in town. Because of that, Corrie hadn\u2019t thought of him as a real person with a home and a wife and perhaps children.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing a missing person\u2019s search, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged, which in itself was an answer. \u201cGo, and have a good time with Peggy,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to bring you back anything for lunch?\u201d</p><p>Roy shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll get by with peanut butter and jelly.\u201d His favorite midday meal.</p><p>Corrie left then, and spent a pleasant afternoon with her new friend. It felt good to get out, to be part of the annual Christmas-shopping experience. They ate at the mall\u2019s food court, chatting over pizza slices and Coke as holiday tunes filled the air. Soon the two women were caught up in the crowd of shoppers.</p><p>Corrie bought Linnette new gloves and Mack a Cedar Cove sweatshirt, and Peggy chose a new golf club for Bob and a book of plays. Bob loved community theater. Roy and Corrie had recently seen him in the fall production of Arsenic and Old Lace. He was actually quite talented. For her husband, Corrie bought a beautiful volume of Sherlock Holmes stories.</p><p>From Peggy\u2019s comments, Corrie sensed that Bob was putting the unfortunate circumstances regarding the John Doe behind him. She knew the police had questioned him, but whatever their concern, it had apparently been laid to rest.</p><p>The two women left the mall at about three, saying goodbye in the parking lot. Vendors sold fresh-cut Christmas trees, and Corrie breathed deeply, inhaling the pungent scent of pine and fir. Nothing smelled more like Christmas.</p><p>When she returned to the office, she found Roy hunched over his computer, a plate and an empty milk glass sitting on his desk. He stared intently at the computer screen and hadn\u2019t noticed her.</p><p>\u201cAny phone calls?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Roy raised his head. \u201cOh, hi. What? Phone calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the telephone go ring, ring, ring?\u201d she teased.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear about my lunch?\u201d She waited, but when he didn\u2019t respond, she continued. \u201cIn case you\u2019re interested, Peggy and I had a great time. I was thinking maybe we could invite them over for New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d</p><p>Again nothing.</p><p>Corrie sighed. \u201cPeggy\u2019s such a good cook, I\u2019ll bet no one ever thinks to invite her to dinner. You like Bob, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Her husband stared up at her blankly. Corrie was starting to feel irritated.</p><p>\u201cI like the Beldons,\u201d she said in a firm voice. \u201cI think all four of us could become friends.\u201d</p><p>Roy leaned back in his chair and fixed his gaze on her. \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be a good idea.\u201d</p><p>Corrie\u2019s cheerful mood evaporated. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Roy stood and walked slowly around his desk. His shoulders slouched, he ran his hand through his hair, disheveling it.</p><p>Corrie stiffened. Roy had found something in his Internet search, and whatever it was, he didn\u2019t want to tell her.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Bob is somehow linked to the John Doe?\u201d she asked bluntly.</p><p>Roy\u2019s eyes met hers and he nodded.</p><p>She swallowed tightly. The one friend she\u2019d found, and now this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you think Bob had something to do with his death?\u201d she asked next. She didn\u2019t want to believe it, didn\u2019t want to consider what that would mean for Peggy.</p><p>Roy walked back to the other side of his desk and sat down. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not ruling it out.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s Christmas was all planned. Justine, Seth and Leif, as well as her mother, would be at her house for dinner by midafternoon. Olivia had invited Jack, too, but unfortunately he\u2019d already made arrangements to join Eric and Shelly and the twins in Reno.</p><p>\u201cNext year we\u2019ll be together,\u201d Jack promised. He\u2019d stopped at her place early Christmas morning, before he left for the airport. She gave him her gift\u2014a first edition of H. L. Mencken\u2014and he set his gifts for her under the tree.</p> <p>\u201cPromise for next year?\u201d she asked, when he\u2019d kissed her farewell.</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d Jack gathered her in his arms and kissed her again.</p><p>Olivia felt the warmth of that kiss all the way to her toes, and when he\u2019d finished, her head was spinning. They were only now recovering their ease and comfort with each other, although they remained a little on edge, afraid of toppling the delicate balance.</p><p>For her part, Olivia was careful. Neither of them had discussed Stan, although her ex-husband still called her often\u2014always for what appeared to be legitimate reasons.</p><p>Stan was smart. He wanted back in her life and he was a patient man. For the moment, he was letting things slide, doing nothing overt. Olivia knew her ex-husband, though. At some point, when he figured the time was right, Stan would swoop in.</p> <p>\u201cWill you be here for New Year\u2019s Eve?\u201d she asked, looking up at Jack. The thought of spending the night playing Scrabble with her mother held little appeal, although it\u2019d been their tradition for almost a decade. If Jack could join them, it would turn an otherwise routine evening into something truly entertaining. Charlotte loved Jack as much as Olivia did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I already made other plans.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded, and her heart thudded to an abrupt halt. \u201cNot with another woman, I hope?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and appeared to be amused by her small display of jealousy. \u201cIt\u2019s not what you think. I volunteered to be part of a retreat for Alcoholics Anonymous. I\u2019m sorry. If I\u2019d thought about it, I would\u2019ve cleared it with you first.\u201d</p><p>She had no right to make that kind of demand on him. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem. I...I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d</p><p>Jack kissed her one final time. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, too.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia walked him to his car and waved as he drove off. She wouldn\u2019t see him again until after the first of the year. Sadness settled over her. And so did a measure of regret. The difficulties in their relationship had come about because she\u2019d allowed herself to get caught up in Stan\u2019s sudden need for her and the nostalgia she\u2019d felt for their past. A past that couldn\u2019t be retrieved...</p><p>Olivia shook off her somber mood, and Christmas was wonderful. With her mother\u2019s help, Olivia\u2019s turkey turned out golden-brown and succulent. Although he was still too young to appreciate Christmas, Leif was thoroughly spoiled by Olivia. Stan had dropped off his gifts earlier in the week.</p><p>They opened their presents after brunch, and it was an hour full of laughter and exclamations of pleasure. The contrast between Jack\u2019s gifts to her and Stan\u2019s seemed very telling to Olivia. Jack had bought her a small framed black-and-white photograph of the Cedar Cove lighthouse, one of Jon Bowman\u2019s pictures. He\u2019d also given her a new Cross pen, to replace the old one she\u2019d used for years. Stan had bought her a diamond pendant, an \u201cany woman\u201d sort of gift. It seemed oddly impersonal, although Justine immediately made her put it on.</p><p>At three o\u2019clock, the small party telephoned James and Selina in San Diego and eighteen-month-old Isabella chattered away. Unfortunately, little of what her granddaughter said was decipherable to Olivia. What did come across was that this was the first Christmas her granddaughter understood that she had two grandmas. Selina assured Olivia that Isabella loved her gifts: a talking doll with its own baby carriage.</p><p>\u201cI wish you\u2019d invited Dad,\u201d Justine told Olivia privately in the kitchen while scraping the dinner dishes.</p><p>\u201cI thought about it,\u201d Olivia confessed. She had, but she was afraid it would encourage Stan, which was the last thing she wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cI hate it that he spent the day alone.\u201d</p><p>Olivia swallowed down a sense of guilt, but later she reminded herself that if Stan was alone on Christmas Day, it was the result of choices he\u2019d made sixteen years ago. He was the one who\u2019d walked out on their family, on her and their two surviving children. Despite her sympathy for him, and her residual affection, she couldn\u2019t get too involved in comforting her ex-husband, even if he was in the throes of a second divorce. Knowing Stan, that would lead to willfully mistaken impressions; besides, she had other priorities now.</p> <p>\u201cSeth and I are hoping to spend New Year\u2019s Eve at the restaurant,\u201d Justine said casually, without looking at Olivia.</p><p>If that was a hint that her daughter needed someone to watch Leif, Olivia was more than ready to volunteer. Jack had plans, so the only person she worried about upsetting was her mother.</p><p>\u201cLet me check with your grandmother, but if she doesn\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll stay with Leif.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Mom?\u201d Justine was obviously relieved. \u201cI don\u2019t feel right leaving him with a sitter yet.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t blame her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sat with her feet up in front of the fireplace, knitting what seemed to be a man\u2019s sweater, although she hadn\u2019t said who it was for. Possibly Seth, but that didn\u2019t seem likely. If it was, Olivia assumed her mother would\u2019ve finished it before Christmas.</p><p>Sitting down next to Charlotte, Olivia took in the scene around her. A fire flickered in the fireplace and the Christmas stockings that had hung on the mantel were down now, empty and spread across the coffee table. Seth held his sleeping son cradled in his arms; he, too, had dozed off. Christmas music played softly from the CD player and the lights on the tree sparkled. It was about as perfect a Christmas as she could remember.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cwould you mind terribly if I didn\u2019t join you this New Year\u2019s Eve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you have other plans?\u201d</p><p>Olivia looked at her quizzically; her mother seemed pleased by the prospect of spending the evening alone. \u201cJustine asked me to watch Leif so she and Seth could be at the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means, Olivia, you stay with Leif. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to drive by and pick you up?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Charlotte returned. \u201cI might have a date of my own, you know.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. Charlotte had men friends, but no beaus. Her friends had encouraged her to pursue a second relationship, but Charlotte had refused. Life was simpler that way, she\u2019d always said.</p><p>Following her divorce, well-meaning friends had tried to set Olivia up with various men. Had circumstances been different, she might\u2019ve been interested. But at the time, she was in no condition to get involved with anyone, and she knew it.</p><p>In addition, Justine and James had needed her. Her world and theirs had just collapsed, crushing them under the weight of their combined grief. For a long time afterward, the three of them had been emotionally crippled. They\u2019d needed time to recover, and it hadn\u2019t happened quickly or easily.</p><p>In their own ways, they\u2019d each succeeded. James had joined the navy and married Selina. In the military he\u2019d found security, and Selina had offered him the unconditional love he so desperately needed.</p><p>Justine had faltered for years, and had managed to convince herself that she wanted neither a husband nor children. Thankfully, Seth Gunderson had convinced her otherwise.</p><p>For her part, Olivia had found satisfaction and joy in her position on the bench. Meeting Jack had been an unexpected bonus. He\u2019d brought laughter and spontaneity back into her life. With him, she could relax the rigidity that she\u2019d so carefully incorporated into her daily routine.</p><p>Her throat thickened with sudden emotion. She owed Jack so much, and she\u2019d nearly thrown it all away. She\u2019d nearly destroyed the relationship that gave her so much pleasure.</p><p>It dawned on her then that she hadn\u2019t heard from him all day.</p><p>Later that night, after her family had left, Jack did phone, but their conversation was brief. He was flying back the following weekend, and they arranged a dinner date at the Taco Shack, his favorite restaurant. Olivia had to admit she was growing accustomed to reading a menu on a wall.</p><p>After she talked to Jack, Olivia made a pot of tea and sat in front of the Christmas tree, reveling in a peaceful hour or so before bed. It had truly been a wonderful Christmas. The only improvement she could add to the day was Jack, and he\u2019d already promised her they\u2019d be together the following year.</p><p>The phone chimed in the distance, and for a moment she was tempted to let it ring. In retrospect, she wished she had.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she said before glancing at caller ID.</p><p>It was Stan. \u201cSame to you, sweetheart.\u201d He sounded cheerful.</p><p>She resisted the urge to correct him\u2014to tell him she wasn\u2019t his sweetheart and never would be again. \u201cHello, Stan. I imagine you want to talk to Justine and Seth, but they\u2019ve left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m calling to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to ask you out for New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d Before she could object, he added, \u201cThink about the two of us having dinner at the Space Needle, with champagne and ballroom dancing, just like we used to.\u201d</p><p>Clearly he had her confused with his second wife. When she was married to Stan, they could never have afforded such extravagance. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I already have plans.\u201d</p><p>A momentary pause. Then he said, \u201cNot with that newspaper fellow. Tell me you\u2019re not serious.\u201d</p><p>Olivia bit her tongue to keep from defending Jack. It wouldn\u2019t do any good. \u201cIf you must know, I agreed to watch Leif for Justine and Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>She almost confessed that Jack would be at a retreat with some of his AA friends, but quickly decided that was more information than her ex-husband needed to know.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d Stan said, sounding jovial now. \u201cI\u2019ll join you. We\u2019ll put Leif down for the night, drink champagne and dance. It\u2019ll be like old times, just the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Stan chuckled. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep me away from my only grandson, and it\u2019ll be the perfect opportunity for us to talk. Give me a chance to prove myself, Olivia. I made a mistake and I\u2019ve paid for it. It\u2019s time to put the past behind us. I love you. I\u2019ve always loved you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia released a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Stan, but you\u2019re sixteen years too late.\u201d</p><p>Christmas had been a miserable affair for Rosie. Allison was in a rotten mood most of the day because neither Rosie nor Zach could afford to buy her the computer she wanted. Eddie had been disappointed in his gifts, too, but he\u2019d put on a brighter face than Allison. Rosie wondered when their children had become so terribly, terribly spoiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That Saturday, two days after Christmas, Rosie and Zach met to divide the monthly bills. Until the divorce, Zach had always managed the money and had done an excellent job of handling their finances; now they shared this unpleasant task. The divorce had cost them both dearly and continued to do so.</p><p>Zach had brewed a pot of coffee when she arrived at the house. The bills were spread out across the kitchen table, organized alphabetically. She noted that dishes were stacked in the sink and the living room needed to be straightened. From the look of the carpet, no one had vacuumed since before Christmas. She wasn\u2019t about to mention his failings as a housekeeper, however, considering that she wasn\u2019t much better.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re finished there\u2019s something I need to discuss with you,\u201d he said. He reached for the coffeepot and automatically filled two mugs, which he brought to the table. He set hers down, then pulled out a chair across from her.</p><p>Studying the tense look on his face, Rosie decided she\u2019d rather deal with whatever was bothering him first and get it over with. \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, picking up her mug.</p> <p>\u201cIt might be best if we talked about it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are the kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie\u2019s with Jeremy and his mother at the movies, and Allison\u2019s in her room sulking.\u201d</p><p>Nothing had changed from earlier in the week. Rosie glanced at the electric bill and nearly groaned aloud. The water bill was equally high. With both of them employed, they managed to cover expenses, but paying attorneys\u2019 fees and maintaining two residences didn\u2019t leave anything for extras.</p><p>A year ago, Rosie had been shopping the after-Christmas sales, loading up on wrapping paper and ribbon and assorted bargains. This year she couldn\u2019t afford to do that. It was a sad commentary on what her life had become.</p> <p>\u201cAll right, we can talk about Allison first,\u201d Zach said, leaning back in his chair. He folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>His body language made her feel a little wary, and she braced herself for whatever he had to say.</p><p>\u201cFor starters, Allison gave me a list I\u2019m supposed to share with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA list?\u201d Rosie asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cApparently she\u2019s got it in her head that the judge awarded her and Eddie the house, so she\u2019s the one in charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting up with that notion,\u201d Rosie assured him. Frankly she\u2019d be shocked if Zach fell into line with any ultimatum their daughter presented.</p> <p>His mouth quivered slightly and she could tell he was more amused than angry. \u201cTake a look at this,\u201d he said. He unfolded the single sheet of paper and handed it to her.</p><p>Rosie scanned the carefully typed list of rules their fifteen-year-old daughter had given them. \u201cWhat?\u201d she burst out incredulously. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to stay out of the family room if Allison has a friend over and they\u2019re watching television?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt gets better,\u201d Zach told her.</p><p>Rosie\u2019s eyes widened as she continued down the sheet. \u201cWe\u2019re not to embarrass her by asking if she has her homework done or any other personal questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a rule for Eddie, too.\u201d He pointed toward the bottom of the page.</p><p>Rosie couldn\u2019t help it, she laughed outright at the last item on the page. \u201cEddie\u2019s supposed to have his hair combed at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently her little brother\u2019s unruly hair is an embarrassment to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and neither one of us makes the grade, either,\u201d she said, waving the sheet of rules.</p> <p>Zach nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re forbidden to enter her room, you\u2019ll notice. And we require Her Majesty\u2019s permission before cleaning in there or touching her stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this lifetime.\u201d Zach could make his own decisions when it came to Allison\u2019s list, but for her part Rosie was planning to ignore it.</p><p>\u201cI wish this was the only letter I had to show you,\u201d Zach said, growing serious. \u201cThe school wrote and said Allison\u2019s grades have dropped considerably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they suggest counseling?\u201d Having Allison talk to a professional would be expensive, but Rosie would do whatever was necessary to help their daughter through this difficult transition period.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think counseling\u2019s the answer, especially with her attitude. I have a better idea, but only if you agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d At this point Rosie was open to just about anything. They were losing Allison. Every day their daughter seemed to be drawing further and further away from them. She was angry and rebellious. Rosie knew Allison had every right to feel the things she did, but she couldn\u2019t stand by and do nothing while her daughter self-destructed.</p><p>\u201cAllison\u2019s pretty disappointed about not getting a computer for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t news to Rosie; she\u2019d already heard it, many times over.</p><p>\u201cWhat if she earns it?\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cEarns it? How?\u201d Rosie couldn\u2019t see her daughter babysitting or doing the kinds of chores a typical fifteen-year-old did to earn extra cash.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I bring her into the office?\u201d Zach suggested. \u201cTax time is always hectic and we could use an extra pair of hands for filing, photocopying and so on. It would be a real part-time job with a real paycheck.\u201d</p><p>Rosie\u2019s heart started to pound with excitement. \u201cThat way we\u2019d be able to monitor where she is after school, and who she\u2019s with.\u201d One of Rosie\u2019s biggest concerns was the new friends Allison had found. Where Allison went and who she was with\u2014those were major concerns for both Zach and Rosie.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a brilliant idea.\u201d Rosie nodded happily. \u201cAnd Eddie\u2019s been going to his friend Nick\u2019s place in the afternoons, so that\u2019s not an issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison has to agree first,\u201d Zach reminded her. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly her favorite person at the moment. There are no guarantees. She could say no when she learns she\u2019d be working at the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Rosie said, \u201cshe wants a computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall we mention it together?\u201d</p><p>Rosie nodded, grateful to be included in the discussion. Zach went down the hallway that led to the bedrooms. A few minutes later, he returned with Allison, who had recently pierced her nose. Rosie cringed when she noticed, but managed to keep her opinion to herself. This new piercing was a response to not getting the computer she wanted, Rosie suspected. The kids had received some Christmas money from their grandparents, and the nose ring must be what Allison had spent hers on.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and I want to talk to you,\u201d Zach said when Allison slouched against the counter, arms crossed, defiance radiating from every part of her body.</p><p>\u201cI figured you would when you read my list. I\u2019m not willing to compromise on any of my fifteen points. Since the house belongs to Eddie and me, I expect you to live up to my stipulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can discuss that later,\u201d Zach said, smoothly diverting her from that subject. \u201cWhat your mother and I wanted to tell you was how sorry we are that you didn\u2019t get a computer for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Allison glanced between them, as though she wasn\u2019t sure she should believe what Zach had said. She shrugged, implying it was no big deal, although that certainly wasn\u2019t the impression she\u2019d given earlier.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford it, Allison. I couldn\u2019t be sorrier.\u201d Zach looked genuinely regretful. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve come up with a way for you to get a computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d Her eyes brightened with hope.</p><p>\u201cI want to hire you,\u201d Zach said. \u201cTax time\u2019s coming and my new assistant needs some additional help.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes, which had widened just a moment earlier, narrowed now with suspicion. \u201cYou want me to earn a computer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your decision. I\u2019m just giving you the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged again, as if she wasn\u2019t sure she should admit it. \u201cI\u2019d want a dollar more than minimum wage to start,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I should be paid overtime if I have to work extra hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only fair,\u201d Zach agreed.</p><p>Allison glanced from Rosie to her father and then back. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, but only because I want a new computer. Don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing me any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d Zach assured her.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to talk about my list now?\u201d she asked, straightening abruptly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave that for later. All right?\u201d</p><p>She sighed in a loud, exasperated way. \u201cI guess.\u201d And with that she returned to her room.</p><p>Zach\u2019s gaze met Rosie\u2019s, and for the first time in what felt like years, they shared a smile.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>Maryellen had been feeling anxious all morning, the first day of the new year. She\u2019d invited Jon to dinner, and to her delight and surprise, he\u2019d accepted. Only later did she realize that she\u2019d offered to cook a meal for a man who was a professional chef. Her expertise in the kitchen was limited to packaged macaroni and cheese and frozen entr\u00e9es. With anyone else, she would\u2019ve ordered takeout, but Jon ate restaurant food every day. She felt obliged to make the effort to cook for him.</p><p>But the meal wasn\u2019t even her main concern. The important thing about this dinner was what she planned to tell him.</p><p>She wanted to change the terms of their relationship. And she wanted him to know that she treasured his Christmas gift, a photo album filled with pictures of the first four months of Katie\u2019s life.</p><p>Jon\u2019s photographs revealed hidden beauty in nature, catching an unexpected pattern or a fleeting moment. But his pictures of their daughter showed far more than the changes he documented as she grew week by week. Maryellen also saw the deep love he felt for his child.</p><p>Christmas morning when she unwrapped his gift and slowly turned the pages of the album, tears had spilled from her eyes. Jon loved his daughter, and if she\u2019d read him correctly, he had strong feelings for her, too. Maryellen prayed she was right.</p><p>The first picture in the album was a shot of Maryellen smiling into the camera, her belly huge with their unborn child. The next photos were of her in the hospital and then of Katie in the nursery.</p><p>Her favorite was a picture he\u2019d taken on the autumn day she\u2019d gone out to his property and the eagle had been soaring high above, wings spread wide. Jon had captured Maryellen holding Katie and pointing toward the bird. He\u2019d caught their daughter\u2019s face in the sun, Katie\u2019s jubilation and the soaring eagle, all in one dramatic shot.</p><p>Naturally, with Jon\u2019s visit at hand and her insecurity about cooking, Katie was fussy all day, interrupting Maryellen at every turn. In the end, with cookbooks spread over the kitchen counters, she decided to bake a salmon, accompanied with wild rice and fresh asparagus. Meal preparation wasn\u2019t exactly rocket science, but just then it felt like it.</p><p>The table was set and dinner ready to be served when Jon rang the doorbell.</p><p>Maryellen paused for a few seconds to calm her pounding heart before she answered, arranging a welcoming smile on her face, despite her nerves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jon brought a bottle of white wine and a bouquet of yellow daisies.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, ushering him in.</p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me.\u201d Jon stepped into the house and stood there for a moment, looking awkward and out of place. He seemed as nervous as Maryellen. Katie sat upright in her bassinet and obviously recognized her daddy\u2019s voice. Almost immediately she started chattering and waving her arms.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really developing a personality, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Jon said. He walked over to the bassinet, lifting Katie into his arms with familiar ease. Maryellen recalled how uncomfortable he\u2019d seemed in the beginning. That had definitely changed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll get dinner on the table,\u201d Maryellen told him. She\u2019d forgotten to remove her apron, which she immediately stuffed into a kitchen drawer. Heaven forbid he should know how hard she\u2019d worked on this meal.</p><p>Jon followed her into the kitchen and grinned when he noticed the number of open cookbooks.</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s gaze followed his. \u201cMom told me that the people with the most cookbooks are the ones who cook the least. That\u2019s certainly true in my case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m easy to please.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen hoped that was true. \u201cI\u2019m not much good at this, so if dinner isn\u2019t up to par, I hope you\u2019ll take into account that I don\u2019t do this often.\u201d The serving dishes were already out, and she quickly transferred everything from the stove to the table.</p> <p>\u201cKatie\u2019s already eaten,\u201d she said, standing at the table with her hands on the back of her chair, fingers clenching it tightly.</p><p>Jon put his daughter back in the bassinet and joined Maryellen. She\u2019d placed the flowers in a crystal vase; they provided a cheery accent and perfectly complemented her pale yellow table linens. He opened the bottle and poured them each a glass as she jumped up to put on some music. When she finally sat down across from him, she offered him a shy smile. She was an emotional mess; if he said one derogatory thing about this dinner, she knew she\u2019d burst into tears.</p><p>Jon served her and then himself, although by this time she had no appetite.</p><p>\u201cI was surprised you came,\u201d she said, not meeting his eyes. When she\u2019d issued the invitation for New Year\u2019s, she wasn\u2019t at all sure he\u2019d accept. For some reason, it seemed important to start this year off right, and for Maryellen that included a good relationship with her baby\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised I did, too,\u201d Jon confessed.</p><p>That stung. So much for flattering her ego or reassuring her. \u201cWhy did you?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Jon glanced up, grinning sheepishly. \u201cYou seemed so sincere. I guess I wanted to be with you more than I wanted to stay away.\u201d</p><p>That was as confusing as his original comment. She thought about pressing the issue, then decided against it. \u201cThank you for the photo album. I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked your gift, too. No one\u2019s ever knit me socks before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they fit?\u201d</p><p>He nodded and pointed down at his feet with a smile. \u201cWearing them now.\u201d She smiled back. As he reached into the middle of the table for a dinner roll, Maryellen automatically passed him the butter.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could\u2019ve been with us at Christmas, but you had other plans, and I understand that,\u201d she said, watching him for any telltale sign that would indicate where he\u2019d been and with whom.</p><p>To her disappointment, Jon didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>They ate silently for a few moments and then Maryellen put down her fork. She couldn\u2019t swallow another bite. \u201cI wanted you to come tonight because...because I feel I owe you an apology\u2014for the way I behaved when I learned I was pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes, flashing with amusement, flew up to meet hers. \u201cI like it when you apologize. Remember the last time?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen had forgotten how they\u2019d ended up kissing....</p><p>\u201cAnyway, you don\u2019t owe me an apology,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>But she did, and she had every intention of saying what needed to be said. \u201cThen I owe you an explanation.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is to me.\u201d Maryellen\u2019s voice trembled slightly. She should probably wait until after dinner, but the need to explain felt like a rock on her chest. She wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy any part of their evening until she\u2019d unburdened herself to Jon.</p><p>\u201cI think you know that I was married while I was in college.\u201d She set her napkin on the table and picked up the wineglass. Her hand tightened around the stem as she took a long sip of the spicy gew\u00fcrztraminer\u2014coincidentally one of her favorite wines. It had a calming effect on her. \u201cClint and I got married for all the wrong reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone has regrets,\u201d Jon said gently.</p><p>\u201cSome people have more than others,\u201d she whispered, unable to look at him. \u201cClint and I were careful, but I was pregnant at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the pregnancy\u2019s the reason you married him?\u201d</p><p>She was ashamed to admit the truth. \u201cI married him because I\u2019d convinced myself I loved him and that he loved me. He didn\u2019t want the baby. He thought it best to terminate the pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Jon was silent as he leaned back in his chair.</p><p>Unable to remain sitting, Maryellen stood and walked into the living room, stopping by Katie\u2019s bassinet. She peered at her sleeping baby, tears trickling down her cheeks. Impatiently she dashed them away.</p><p>There would be other pregnancies, other babies, Clint had told her, but the timing was critical. Maryellen had listened to him. She went against every dictate of her heart, and she\u2019d regretted it from that moment on. For years she\u2019d struggled with the guilt and the shame of what she\u2019d done. What she\u2019d never admitted to herself or to Clint, until it was too late, was how much she\u2019d wanted her baby. She didn\u2019t blame her ex-husband. She was the one who walked into the clinic. The one who\u2019d signed the consent form. She accepted full responsibility.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen,\u201d Jon said, coming up behind her. He placed his hands on her shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s all right\u2014there\u2019s no need to say any more. I can figure out what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>Jon turned her and brought her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want you to know I was pregnant last year,\u201d she said, her face buried in his shoulder. \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d react the way Clint did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Clint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re nothing like him. I know that now.\u201d What she didn\u2019t know was anything about his past. Even now, more than a year later, she\u2019d learned very little\u2014just fragments of his history. Small bits of information he\u2019d let drop now and then. Every time she pried into his life, he pulled away from her, both physically and emotionally. Maryellen had come to rely on him in so many ways, she couldn\u2019t bear to risk that withdrawal, so she kept her questions to herself.</p><p>She slowly raised her eyes to Jon\u2019s, fearing what she\u2019d see. Instead of condemnation and repulsion, she saw understanding and love. If he\u2019d judged her harshly, she wasn\u2019t sure what she would have done. When she saw his love, her reaction was instinctive.</p><p>She kissed him.</p><p>It\u2019d been weeks since they\u2019d last touched, since she\u2019d been in his arms. Maryellen hadn\u2019t truly understood how much she\u2019d missed him\u2014everything about him\u2014and the moment their mouths met, she lost control.</p><p>Jon\u2019s reaction was immediate. He splayed his fingers in her hair and their kisses became passionate, full of desperation and need. When he broke it off, he had to catch his breath. Maryellen clung to him, her own breathing labored.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure this is such a good idea,\u201d he said as he disengaged her arms from around his neck. Holding both her hands in his, he retreated a step.</p><p>This was what Maryellen had dreaded. Her heart sank as she pulled her hands free. She\u2019d waited too long to tell him, delayed explaining. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else...isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone else?\u201d he repeated. \u201cNo way.\u201d He reached for her and brought her back into his arms. Then he kissed her again, and again. Harder, deeper, longer.</p><p>He was telling her the truth; she had her answer. Although she knew almost nothing about Jon, she trusted him. He couldn\u2019t kiss her like this if he was involved with another woman. Soon, however, he eased away from her again, his reluctance obvious.</p><p>Maryellen didn\u2019t want him to stop, and when she managed to shake off the warm haze that enveloped her, she opened her eyes and stared up at him.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d That was when she realized he planned to end their lovemaking. \u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she pleaded, \u201cplease don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know. You don\u2019t want me?\u201d She hated the plea she heard in her own voice.</p><p>For just a moment, a hint of a smile touched his mouth. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I want you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I...I want you, too.\u201d She blushed as she said it. Until Jon, there\u2019d only been one man in her life, so she didn\u2019t say those words lightly. If they were lovers again, he\u2019d know she was sincere, he\u2019d know she regretted the way she\u2019d treated him earlier. He\u2019d know how much she wanted him to be a permanent part of her life and Katie\u2019s.</p><p>Slowly, Jon shook his head.</p><p>Stunned and hurt, Maryellen retreated a step. She could only imagine what he must think of her, blatantly throwing herself at him like that. Perhaps this was his way of punishing her. She\u2019d been brutal in her rejection of him and now it was her turn.</p><p>Jon frowned, and his eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking, but whatever it is, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Katie began to wake\u2014the perfect excuse for Maryellen to turn away and recover her pride and her composure. The moment she lifted Katie from the carrier, Maryellen could tell the baby needed changing.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a fresh diaper,\u201d she said, welcoming the excuse to leave the room.</p><p>Jon wouldn\u2019t allow her to escape. He followed her into the nursery. \u201cAre you on the pill?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d There wasn\u2019t any need for her to be.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to protect you.\u201d</p><p>She was an idiot. Of course he was worried about birth control. They were already batting a thousand, and there was no guarantee that she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, get pregnant a second time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still nursing, and there\u2019s less likelihood I\u2019d get caught.\u201d But that sounded weak, even to her own ears. She\u2019d been caught easily enough with Katie. \u201cThat isn\u2019t why you refused me, though, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d At least he was honest, even if the truth hurt. \u201cNo,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThe fact is, Maryellen, I\u2019m not interested in another one-night stand with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously think that\u2019s what I wanted?\u201d She quickly disposed of the wet diaper and exchanged it for a fresh one. \u201cI...I didn\u2019t plan to invite you into my bed, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. Dinner wasn\u2019t about that. It just sort of...went in that direction.\u201d Although she\u2019d hoped this meeting would be a new beginning for them\u2014emotionally and, yes, physically. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said, tucking Katie against her hip. Her face was hot with anger and embarrassment. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. This entire discussion is ridiculous. I apologize for my presumption. I\u2019m sorry....\u201d If he didn\u2019t leave soon, she was going to humiliate herself even more.</p><p>Jon hesitated and Maryellen was afraid she\u2019d have to ask him to leave.</p><p>Then he turned abruptly and left the room. She followed him and didn\u2019t try to stop him when he grabbed his jacket and walked out the door.</p> <p>Her stomach was in knots as she held her daughter close to her heart. \u201cI blew it,\u201d she told Katie. Hard as she\u2019d tried to make this night special, she\u2019d failed. She\u2019d hoped so much that this evening would be the turning point for her and Jon, but all she\u2019d managed to do was alienate him.</p><p>And in the process, break her own heart.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>What had seemed such a brilliant plan earlier was rapidly becoming a problem, Zach mused at his desk. School had resumed after Christmas vacation, and Allison had started working for Smith, Cox and Jefferson today. She seemed to take pride in dressing outrageously\u2014in a manner guaranteed to embarrass him with his associates. Zach was somewhat horrified that she\u2019d gone to school looking like she\u2019d just climbed out of bed, complete with flannel pajama bottoms and bedroom slippers. In his day, no principal would\u2019ve put up with it.</p><p>Allison arrived thirty minutes late with a chain of safety pins dangling from each ear. He\u2019d had to fight to keep from dragging her into the parking lot and telling her the deal was off. If she wanted to work in his office, she was to show up on time and dress appropriately. He would\u2019ve done it, too, but he hated to fire his own daughter her first day on the job.</p> <p>Zach decided he shouldn\u2019t get directly involved. When he\u2019d offered Allison employment, he\u2019d told her she was to be an assistant to Cecilia Randall, and he was standing by that.</p><p>As soon as he had a free moment, Zach called Cecilia and Allison into his office.</p><p>Allison stood there, wearing an old sweater three sizes too big over the pajamas. He could only imagine where she\u2019d gotten it. Cecilia and all the other women employed in the office wore proper business attire.</p><p>\u201cAllison, this is Ms. Randall. You\u2019ll be working with her.\u201d</p><p>Allison glared defiantly in Cecilia\u2019s direction.</p><p>Cecilia ignored the dirty look and smiled warmly at his daughter.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve offered Allison the job as your assistant, Ms. Randall,\u201d he said, doing his best to ignore his daughter\u2019s attitude. \u201cI want you to treat her exactly as you would any other part-time employee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any favors,\u201d Allison announced.</p><p>Cecilia nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good, because it wouldn\u2019t be fair to the others if I treated you any differently.\u201d</p><p>Zach didn\u2019t know if handing his problem child over to his assistant was going to work. Cecilia was a new employee herself. She\u2019d fit in nicely with the staff and done an impressive job thus far. But he wasn\u2019t sure she was up to dealing with his rebellious, angry teenager. No one could take Allison\u2019s attitude for long, and he felt guilty about thrusting her on an unsuspecting employee.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, I have to do what she says,\u201d Allison muttered with a disparaging glance at Cecilia.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you want to keep the job,\u201d Zach returned, letting Cecilia know she had firing privileges. If Allison pulled any more stunts like the ones she had this afternoon, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her around.</p><p>\u201cIs that agreeable?\u201d he asked Cecilia.</p><p>His assistant nodded.</p> <p>\u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>His daughter shrugged. \u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>The two left his office, and despite a vague sense of guilt, Zach was glad to shift the responsibility elsewhere. The door started to close but not before he heard Allison taunt his assistant.</p><p>\u201cYou can fire me if you want, Ms. Randall, but remember, my dad is the one who signs your paycheck.\u201d</p><p>Zach shut his eyes and prayed for patience.</p><p>The first week was the worst. By the middle of the month, however, Zach noticed several small changes in Allison, beginning with her timely arrival at work. And while she wasn\u2019t going to receive any fashion awards, she wore jeans and a respectable-looking sweatshirt. He was tempted to say something when he saw her, but knew it would be a mistake to call attention to the improvement in her attire.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to start making copies of the completed income tax forms?\u201d Zach heard Allison ask Cecilia as he walked out of his office. His daughter completely ignored him, but he was accustomed to that.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Cecilia told her. \u201cI\u2019ve got a stack halfway to the ceiling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get on it right away.\u201d Moving quickly and efficiently, Allison hauled the first stack of files to the copy machine.</p><p>If Zach didn\u2019t know better, he\u2019d think...Why, it sounded as though Allison was eager to work. She actually seemed enthusiastic about her job.</p><p>Rosie noticed a change in Allison, too, and mentioned it when he saw her one Sunday afternoon toward the end of January. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, astonished.</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew,\u201d Zach murmured. Allison continued to display plenty of attitude at home, but some of the more pressing problems seemed to have abated. Her boyfriend, Ryan Wilson, had apparently vanished. Zach hadn\u2019t seen the boy in weeks, for which he was profoundly grateful. Allison\u2019s questionable new friends hadn\u2019t been around all month, either. To top everything off, her geometry teacher phoned and commented on a noticeable improvement in her grades and attitude.</p><p>\u201cI guess earning the money to buy her own computer is exactly what Allison needed.\u201d Rosie relaxed, leaning against the kitchen counter. \u201cYou know what? I think what you did is absolutely inspired.\u201d</p><p>His ex-wife\u2019s praise felt good, especially after all the tension between them in recent months. However, Zach wasn\u2019t comfortable accepting it. \u201cI suspect we both have someone else to thank for the changes in Allison\u2014someone at the office. Let me find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Rosie was just as eager to learn who or what had brought about the change in Allison.</p><p>Zach knew the person to ask. Early the next morning, he called Cecilia Randall into his office. Tax season was starting and soon he\u2019d be overwhelmed.</p><p>\u201cCan you sit down a moment?\u201d Zach said, gesturing her in.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Cecilia slipped into the chair across from his desk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like a progress report on Allison.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia instantly brightened. \u201cI\u2019m delighted with her performance. She doesn\u2019t have any problem doing whatever I ask and her attitude is great.\u201d</p><p>That fact hadn\u2019t escaped Zach\u2019s notice. \u201cHow did all of this happen?\u201d He hadn\u2019t meant to be that blunt, but he didn\u2019t have time to ask discreet questions; he needed to know.</p><p>\u201cHappen?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYou saw her that first day. She was an inch short of belligerent.\u201d</p><p>His assistant glanced down at the floor and Zach realized she was trying to hide a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s a very nice girl,\u201d Cecilia assured him. \u201cI\u2019m not having any trouble with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the way I used to think about Allison,\u201d Zach said. \u201cBut everything changed after my wife and I divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison mentioned the divorce?\u201d As far as he knew, his daughter considered the whole matter \u201cbogus\u201d\u2014one of her current favorite words\u2014and refused to discuss it.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Cecilia let her hand rest on the tablet she held in her lap. \u201cYou see, my parents divorced when I was a kid. I know what it\u2019s like when a family falls apart. Allison just needed someone to talk to.\u201d</p><p>Zach yearned to explain that tearing his family apart had never been what he wanted. He blamed Rosie for being jealous and unreasonable. In retrospect, he was embarrassed that he\u2019d been so caught up in the negative emotions that had precipitated the divorce and surrounded the whole subject for months. He found it difficult to believe that he and Rosie had haggled over every aspect of the property settlement and the parenting plan. They\u2019d each been so determined to make sure the other didn\u2019t get a \u201cbetter\u201d deal. That was just the beginning. They were both driven by their need to prove who was right. They\u2019d allowed pride, ego and a sense of vindictiveness to destroy any chance of settling the divorce in a civil manner.</p><p>If he\u2019d been able to look into the future, to witness the pain he\u2019d brought his children\u2014if Zach had so much as guessed how lonely and lost he\u2019d feel without Rosie\u2014he\u2019d have done whatever was necessary to save his family and his marriage. Before he realized how far things had gone, it was too late.</p><p>Recently, he and Rosie had begun to communicate in a more honest and more courteous manner. He knew she was dating that widower, although they never talked about it.</p><p>However, Zach\u2019s own pride wouldn\u2019t allow him to admit that Janice Lamond no longer worked for him. He\u2019d led Rosie to believe she\u2019d gotten a promotion within the firm. By now, Allison had probably told her mother that Janice wasn\u2019t working there anymore. Rosie must\u2019ve gloated at the news, although to her credit, she hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>\u201cWill that be all, Mr. Cox?\u201d Cecilia Randall asked.</p><p>For a moment he\u2019d forgotten she was in the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, Zach drove Allison home. Rosie was spending the night with the children, and the thought of walking into his dark apartment and making dinner held little appeal. Allison sat quietly beside him.</p><p>They hardly ever talked these days, and Zach missed their conversations. She\u2019d spurned his attempts so often that after a while he\u2019d given up trying.</p><p>\u201cDid you know Cecilia had a baby who died?\u201d his daughter suddenly asked him.</p><p>This was news to Zach. \u201cNo, when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost three years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that,\u201d Zach said, completely sincere.</p><p>\u201cShe told me all about it. Her husband was at sea and she didn\u2019t have any friends here to help her. It was awful and she decided she couldn\u2019t stay married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Randall\u2019s been married before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Allison\u2019s tone made him sound stupid for asking.</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s still married to the same man?\u201d It wasn\u2019t any of Zach\u2019s business, but he was trying to keep Allison talking. They so rarely spoke without arguing that he didn\u2019t want their conversation to end.</p><p>\u201cCecilia and her husband went to divorce court, the same as you and Mom. The judge told them they needed to think it through before they rushed into a divorce.\u201d</p><p>Zach could hardly believe any judge would say such a thing, especially in these days of no-fault divorce. \u201cNot in those words, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his daughter agreed. \u201cBut close. Cecilia said she was pregnant when she and Ian got married and she wanted to make sure he wasn\u2019t marrying her just because of the baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zach didn\u2019t understand what that had to do with anything. He murmured a noncommittal response, hoping she\u2019d enlighten him.</p><p>She did. \u201cCecilia had him sign an agreement before she\u2019d marry him. Then later, when they were in the court and the judge read the agreement, she wouldn\u2019t let them get rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this judge gave them a reason to stop and think about what they were doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Allison said.</p> <p>\u201cSmart judge,\u201d Zach said, wishing the one who\u2019d been assigned his divorce suit had shown the same wisdom in dealing with him and Rosie. If someone had stepped in and talked sense to him and his ex, it might have saved his family a lot of grief.</p><p>\u201cYou know her,\u201d Allison said next.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Zach asked as he turned off Harbor Street and headed toward Pelican Court.</p><p>\u201cThe judge.\u201d The look his daughter flashed him said that should be obvious. \u201cIt\u2019s the same judge who was in court with you and Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudge Lockhart?\u201d He supposed he should\u2019ve known; unusual verdicts seemed to be her trademark.</p> <p>\u201cI think she must be righteous cool.\u201d</p><p>Zach barely managed to suppress a smile. Righteous cool was something his daughter might\u2019ve said last year. For a moment, it was almost like having her back again, the girl she\u2019d been before the divorce.</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d she said, adjusting the seat belt strap to a more comfortable position. \u201cAnd before you ask, I\u2019m talking about Cecilia, not Judge Lockhart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do.\u201d He would be forever grateful for the way Cecilia had taken his daughter under her wing.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t in the beginning, but then she told me what it was like when her parents divorced.\u201d Allison glanced in his direction and sighed. \u201cShe was just a kid, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Allison nodded. \u201cHer dad took off. Her mom didn\u2019t get any child support, either. Cecilia never really knew her dad when she was growing up. He\u2019s the reason she moved to Cedar Cove. She wanted to get to know him, so she got in touch with him once she finished high school. He said he could get her a job, and she came here. She did get a job at the same restaurant where her dad worked, but it wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d expected. By then it was too late to move back home.\u201d Cecilia\u2019s contribution to the firm was valuable\u2014but her relationship with Allison was worth even more to him.</p><p>Whatever had brought Cecilia to Cedar Cove, he was grateful she\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out with her and her dad, though,\u201d Allison said absently.</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>Allison shrugged. \u201cSounds like he\u2019s a real flake.\u201d</p><p>Zach felt his daughter\u2019s eyes on him. \u201cAm I a flake?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou can be, but overall you\u2019re okay, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Such overwhelming praise was almost more than he could bear. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer dad moved to California when The Captain\u2019s Galley sold. The new owners didn\u2019t offer him a job, which was probably for the best. Cecilia said her dad was drinking up the profits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That sounded like a direct quote. \u201cThis must\u2019ve been about the time her baby died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere around then,\u201d his daughter informed him. \u201cIan was the one who encouraged Cecilia to take accounting classes. That\u2019s her husband, in case you forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was at sea, and they were e-mailing back and forth, getting to know each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Perhaps if he\u2019d had the opportunity to e-mail Rosie, to correspond with her, they might\u2019ve had the same chance. Somehow, putting words on paper gave a person time to think about what he or she was really saying.</p><p>\u201cCecilia said that the minute she met me, she knew I was special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to sound skeptical, but he wanted to know what Cecilia had seen in his daughter. It seemed important to find out.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening?\u201d</p><p>Zach had. To every word. \u201cYes, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of her baby,\u201d Allison said. \u201cHer baby\u2019s name was Allison, too.\u201d</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>As he walked into the Cedar Cove sheriff\u2019s office, Roy McAfee looked around. The room was full of activity; several men and women sat at desks and a dispatcher handled the switchboard. There was a sense of urgency, of purpose, as deputies\u2014uniformed and not\u2014spoke on the phone, carried on conversations or typed at computers.</p><p>Damn it all, this was exactly the atmosphere Roy loved. He wanted to close his eyes, breathe in the scent of stale coffee, the sounds of cops at work. There was an excitement here. He\u2019d almost forgotten what it was like to play an active role in law enforcement and he missed it. Except for the paperwork, he reminded himself. When he was on the force, he\u2019d spent more than half his time filling out forms.</p><p>\u201cHow ya doing, Roy?\u201d a uniformed woman asked when he approached.</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t recognize her. \u201cI\u2019m good. I\u2019m here to see Sheriff Davis.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d Roy had phoned soon after the first of the year, after he\u2019d done everything he could on his end of the investigation. Today he\u2019d give the sheriff what he\u2019d learned. He liked and trusted Troy Davis; the man was no one\u2019s fool. Roy was walking a tightrope, though. Officially he\u2019d been employed by Grace Sherman and more recently Bob Beldon. His first priority was to look after his clients\u2019 interests. If a crime had been committed, his job was to do everything he could to keep his clients clear of the law.</p><p>The female deputy returned. \u201cSheriff Davis will see you now.\u201d</p><p>Roy followed her to the small office. Davis was sitting behind his desk, frowning at something on his computer screen, when Roy entered the room. Troy stood, and the two men exchanged handshakes. Roy took a seat and so did the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Troy Davis asked, leaning back in his chair, giving a relaxed impression.</p><p>Roy wasn\u2019t deceived. The lawman was intensely interested in his visit. \u201cLike I said when I called, I came to talk to you about the John Doe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know something I don\u2019t?\u201d Davis asked.</p><p>Roy considered the question. \u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>That, of course, was the reason Roy was here, although he probably wouldn\u2019t share everything he knew, and where he\u2019d gotten his information would remain with him. Davis understood and accepted that, although Roy knew he\u2019d do his best to trick him into revealing his sources.</p><p>\u201cDuring your investigation, did you run into the names Max Russell or Stewart Samuels, by any chance?\u201d Roy asked. Those were the other two men who\u2019d been with Dan Sherman and Bob Beldon in that patrol in Vietnam. Bob had told him how the four had become separated from their squad and stumbled into the village. Four men, four lives, each marked by that afternoon. Roy had located Samuels, who\u2019d remained in the military and had a distinguished record of service. Of the four, he seemed the least affected by the events in Nam. Russell, however, had lived a troubled life after his release from the army. Like Beldon and Dan Sherman...</p><p>\u201cI might have.\u201d Davis leaned across his desk, nudging a stack of files that tilted precariously.</p><p>Roy was sure Davis couldn\u2019t have heard about the men and had to be bluffing.</p><p>Davis riffled through the files until he found the one he wanted and flipped it open. Roy wasn\u2019t surprised that Davis kept the John Doe case file close at hand. The sheriff leafed through it, then raised his eyes to meet Roy\u2019s. \u201cAre you going to tell me where you came up with these names?\u201d</p><p>Roy grinned and slid down in his chair, crossing his arms. \u201cNo.\u201d He had to protect Bob as much as possible. Even now, he couldn\u2019t be sure of the extent of the other man\u2019s involvement. He wanted to believe Beldon was an innocent bystander, but too many of the dots still didn\u2019t connect.</p><p>The sheriff chuckled. \u201cWhy did I know you were going to say that?\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t bother to answer.</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me why I have the sneaking suspicion either Max Russell or Stewart Samuels is going to be listed as a missing person?\u201d</p><p>Making an effort not to look self-righteous, Roy shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHelp me out a little, if you would,\u201d Troy muttered, turning to face his computer screen. \u201cCan you at least give me a state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that, but I\u2019d hate to see you miss out on the fun of the chase. You might want to start with Russell, though.\u201d</p><p>Troy glanced up, frowning darkly.</p><p>\u201cCalifornia,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>\u201cNot Florida?\u201d The dead man\u2019s false ID had given a Florida address. Davis looked surprised as he punched a few keys, stared at the screen and then peered over the top of his reading glasses. \u201cAre you planning to tell me how you got Russell\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Troy exhaled slowly. \u201cThis is our John Doe?\u201d</p><p>Roy couldn\u2019t be sure of that, but he had his suspicions. \u201cMight be.\u201d</p><p>Troy continued to study the screen. \u201cWhen did you find all this out?\u201d</p><p>Roy gave him a halfhearted smile. \u201cA while back. I dug up what I could and now I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time to bring you into the investigation.\u201d</p><p>Davis snorted. \u201cI appreciate that, but I wish you\u2019d come to me sooner.\u201d</p><p>Roy still wasn\u2019t a hundred-percent sure he was doing the right thing, as far as Bob or Grace Sherman were concerned, but withholding material information put him at risk of committing a crime himself. In his view, everything revolved around what those four men had done in Vietnam.</p><p>Troy tapped his fingers on the desk. \u201cBefore I go making an idiot of myself, did you talk to anyone in California?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>His gaze went back to the computer screen. He did some more typing and glanced at Roy again. \u201cHannah Russell,\u201d he said. \u201cSays here she\u2019s the one who filed the missing person\u2019s report.\u201d He scrolled down. \u201cProbably the wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaughter,\u201d Roy corrected.</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to her?\u201d Davis demanded. The friendly pretense was gone now.</p><p>\u201cAnd step into the middle of your investigation, Sheriff?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould I do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope to hell not, but I thought I\u2019d better ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all yours,\u201d he said. His purpose in making this visit had been achieved. He\u2019d leave the rest in Sheriff Davis\u2019s capable hands. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019d like to thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Davis barked. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how long you\u2019ve been holding on to this information.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a question Roy wanted to answer. He\u2019d kept it to himself as long as he dared. If possible, he wanted to keep Dan Sherman\u2019s family out of this.</p><p>\u201cAny idea why our John Doe arrived in Cedar Cove carrying false identification?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d Roy said. The sheriff would talk to Hannah Russell, and would eventually check out Samuels, too. Roy\u2019s investigation had led him to the other man, who lived in the Washington, D.C., area, but Roy hadn\u2019t contacted him. He\u2019d leave that to Davis, as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the reconstructive surgery? I hear some people in town still think it was Dan Sherman. DNA says otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d trust what the lab tells you,\u201d Roy said, lost in his thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI do, but I\u2019ve heard the rumors.\u201d</p> <p>Roy had, too. People liked to speculate. It was mighty convenient to believe the dead man could\u2019ve been Dan Sherman, although Roy hadn\u2019t heard much talk of that in recent days.</p><p>Roy stood to leave. He\u2019d said everything he intended to and not a word more.</p><p>Davis stood, too. \u201cI\u2019ll thank you, then.\u201d</p><p>Roy walked out of the office and through the department. He\u2019d thought hard about this visit. He wouldn\u2019t betray Beldon\u2019s trust, but there was certain information he could no longer withhold. Beldon was the one who\u2019d given him Russell\u2019s and Samuels\u2019s names\u2014and given him permission to tell the sheriff.</p><p>Four unsuspecting soldiers had been trapped in a Southeast Asian jungle that day and walked straight into hell. What happened next had forever altered the lives of these men, whose sole desire was to come home alive. They\u2019d seen too many of their friends and comrades leave Vietnam in body bags. To them, at that time, it was kill or be killed. War had changed them, changed their world.</p> <p>Corrie was waiting when Roy returned to the office. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Roy took off his jacket and hung it on the coat tree in the entry. \u201cAbout as well as could be expected,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cDoes Bob know you\u2019ve talked to Troy Davis?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jack had been looking forward to this Friday night for two weeks. Because of some commitment Olivia had at the courthouse, she was working late today and had agreed to meet him for dinner at The Lighthouse. They hadn\u2019t had a real honest-to-goodness date since before Christmas, and he\u2019d missed her company. Oh, there\u2019d been lots of phone calls, a couple of quick cups of coffee, but they were both busy people with complicated lives.</p><p>The newspaper conglomerate, which had bought out the once privately owned paper a few years ago, was investigating the possibility of increasing publication from biweekly to five days a week and eventually taking it to a full seven. While the thought of those extra issues and journalistic opportunities excited him, he wasn\u2019t sure this additional responsibility would be worth the toll it would take on his personal life. A daily paper meant hiring and training extra staff, editorial meetings, more administrative duties.</p><p>There was no better way to hook a newsman than offering him more column space. His publisher was well aware of that fact and was using it to his advantage\u2014that and a hefty pay raise. Still, Jack hesitated. As it was, he didn\u2019t see nearly as much of Olivia as he wanted to. He hoped that, someday in the near future, she\u2019d become a permanent part of his life.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to be seated now, Mr. Griffin?\u201d the hostess at the restaurant asked him. \u201cI can show Judge Lockhart to your table once she arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Jack said, impressed that the young woman knew him and Olivia. But then he decided it shouldn\u2019t surprise him. Justine Gunderson and her husband, Seth, owned The Lighthouse, and Justine, after all, was Olivia\u2019s daughter. Besides, his picture appeared in the paper next to his weekly column\u2014a rather flattering photograph if he did say so himself.</p><p>The table was one of the best, with a view that overlooked the cove. The marina lights dancing across the water\u2019s surface had a festive quality that cheered him. He could see the naval shipyard on the other side of the cove, too. Currently it housed an aircraft carrier, several destroyers and any number of diesel submarines docked there for repairs.</p><p>The waiter arrived and Jack ordered coffee, then studied the menu. Only five minutes later, Olivia showed up, breezing into the room with a smile warm enough to melt the iciest heart.</p><p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t keep you waiting long?\u201d she said, slipping into the chair across from him. She looked flustered but happy and excited.</p><p>She was so damn pretty it was hard for Jack to take his eyes off her. \u201cYup. I\u2019ve been waiting for hours.\u201d Which was true; he just hadn\u2019t been sitting at the restaurant all that time.</p><p>Olivia stretched her hand across the table and Jack linked his fingers with hers. \u201cI\u2019ve been anticipating tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing with you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d This was a minor understatement. \u201cAny update on your mother\u2019s fight with City Hall?\u201d he asked before he made a fool of himself by staring at her.</p> <p>Olivia looked up from the menu. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d Usually Jack was the first to pick up on local gossip. But he hadn\u2019t seen as much of Charlotte as he used to. For a while she\u2019d written a seniors\u2019 column for The Chronicle, but had given it up when she was diagnosed with cancer. She\u2019d meant to continue now that she\u2019d recovered, but had become engrossed in her current issue, a community health clinic.</p><p>\u201cMy mother and this newfound friend of hers have decided to stage a demonstration.\u201d Olivia frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about this Ben character, do you?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t, but he wasn\u2019t going to let her sidetrack him. This was real news. \u201cDemonstration for what? A health clinic?\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed deeply. \u201cYou know my mother! Personally I think it\u2019s Ben Rhodes who put the idea in her head. In any event, Mom\u2019s convinced this is what our community needs.\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded; he agreed with Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cMom insists she tried to go through the normal channels, but no one wants to hear it, what with all the budget cuts,\u201d Olivia went on. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she\u2019s going to take matters into her own hands.\u201d Olivia shook her head. \u201cIn which case, God help us all.\u201d</p><p>Jack struggled not to smile. At Charlotte\u2019s urging he\u2019d written several supportive editorials on the need for a health-care clinic.</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin, I swear if you plaster my mother\u2019s picture on the front page of The Chronicle with her holding some ridiculous sign, I may never forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Despite himself, Jack chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m not making any promises.\u201d</p><p>Olivia set aside her menu. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to talk sense into her, but she refuses to listen. She hasn\u2019t got a clue how potentially embarrassing this could be for me.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s not thinking about you, but about the citizens of our community and their needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Olivia agreed, and then paused and glanced up. \u201cI guess I sound pretty self-absorbed about this whole thing, don\u2019t I? But Mom doesn\u2019t realize how much teasing I get at the courthouse. This afternoon someone asked me what I\u2019d do if my own mother ended up in my court. They suggested I make her sit in the corner for fifteen minutes.\u201d Olivia rolled her eyes. \u201cCute, really cute.\u201d Then, as if she\u2019d tired of the subject, she leaned toward him. \u201cEnough about my mother. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d That was the way he felt, now that he had Olivia all to himself. He\u2019d planned a romantic evening. Okay, this was about as romantic as he knew how to be. They\u2019d have dinner, and perhaps later, if the weather cooperated, they could walk along the waterfront. If he was lucky, she\u2019d invite him to the house for coffee. It had been far too long since he\u2019d kissed Olivia Lockhart....</p><p>\u201cAny more on the paper going to five issues a week?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing that I can report, but I think it\u2019s a distinct possibility.\u201d Olivia was well aware of what that would mean, but he didn\u2019t want to waste time discussing the pros and cons of such a move.</p><p>The reason he\u2019d accepted this job was that The Cedar Cove Chronicle was biweekly. The demands of a daily paper had nearly strangled his personal life. For a lot of years, he\u2019d buried himself in his work. It was easy to do, and he\u2019d let it happen.</p><p>That had been early in his career. He\u2019d nearly destroyed himself, first by drowning his sorrows and fears in the bottom of a bottle, and later by working himself to a state of near-collapse. That had been Jack\u2019s attempt to deal with his son\u2019s illness. As a young boy, Eric was diagnosed with leukemia. He later recovered, but at the time Jack had believed his only child was dying and there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do about it, except drink and work.</p><p>During those dark years, when Jack drank, he\u2019d functioned effectively enough at his job\u2014usually hungover\u2014and functioned minimally in society, as a husband, father and friend.</p><p>It was when his marriage died that he\u2019d finally gotten the help he needed. Even then, he\u2019d needed years to straighten himself out.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t leave Cedar Cove, will you?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Jack loved the worry he heard in her voice. Another time, he might have let her assume he\u2019d pack up his computer and head out of town, but they were beyond that. He could no more leave Olivia than he could quit being a newsman. And he couldn\u2019t play manipulative games with her, either. But being honest didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t tease her a bit.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t leave,\u201d he assured her. Then, holding her eyes, he added, \u201cI could never walk away now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she sighed, gazing warmly at him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, \u201cI signed a five-year contract and these people are real sticklers when it comes to contracts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>He enjoyed her indignant expression, all the while admitting that he wasn\u2019t the romantic sort. He loved Olivia Lockhart, though. Perhaps he should try harder to say the right things, but he didn\u2019t have much practice in flowery language. If she wanted to hear that kind of nonsense, her ex-husband was probably an expert.</p><p>Thinking about Stan Lockhart was a mistake. Jack gritted his teeth. Stan irritated him with his pompous assumption that he could have Olivia back anytime he wanted. He made sure Jack knew it, too.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s order,\u201d he said in an effort to turn his thoughts to some other subject. As he reached for the menu, he reminded himself that he was the one spending the evening with Olivia, not her ex.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d Olivia said happily.</p><p>Jack glanced over the specials and decided on the T-bone steak. Olivia vacillated between the scallops on the list of specials and the prime rib. In the end she decided on the scallops.</p><p>\u201cMom said you took her to lunch,\u201d Olivia said when their salad with shrimp piled atop Bibb lettuce was delivered by their efficient and unobtrusive waiter.</p><p>So Olivia knew about that. Drilling her mother over Olivia\u2019s involvement with Stan hadn\u2019t been one of Jack\u2019s finer moments. His excuse was that not knowing was driving him to distraction.</p><p>What he\u2019d learned had depressed him for days. Stan Lockhart was still making a hard play to win back his ex-wife. He had a lot going for him, too. Not only was he financially secure, cultured and sophisticated, but he had a shared history with Olivia and was the father of her children. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The first thing Charlotte had told him was that Stan and Olivia had spent New Year\u2019s Eve together. Charlotte had minimized the fact by explaining that they\u2019d both been watching Leif so Justine and Seth could go to The Lighthouse. Still, it rankled. He could bet that when the clock struck midnight, ol\u2019 Stan was right there with the champagne and the music, ready to give Olivia a lip-lock she wouldn\u2019t soon forget. Jack\u2019s jaw flexed with anger at the thought of Stan so much as touching her.</p><p>In addition, Charlotte had let it drop that Stan occasionally stayed the night in Cedar Cove. From personal experience, Jack knew he\u2019d slept at the house on Lighthouse Road at least once. He also knew Stan had spent the night in the guest bedroom, although Stan had let Jack assume otherwise. Now he had to wonder if Stan continued to sleep over at Olivia\u2019s.</p><p>The truth was, Jack didn\u2019t want to know. He refused to allow Stan to drive a wedge between him and Olivia. Jack had made the mistake of letting that happen once, and as far as he was concerned, history wouldn\u2019t be repeating itself. He was willing to fight for Olivia, dammit. He wasn\u2019t going to step aside\u2014and he wanted to make that very clear\u2014to Olivia and her ex-husband.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Olivia was giving him an odd look.</p> <p>\u201cSorry. Did you say something?\u201d He focused his attention on her and realized Stan had nearly gotten him a second time. Without even trying, Olivia\u2019s ex was ruining this night out.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you how lovely you look?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d Olivia told him, and propped her elbows on the table. \u201cBut I can\u2019t wait to hear.\u201d</p><p>Grace Sherman stared at the computer screen and held her breath. Excitement shot through her. New Orleans! Will wanted to meet her in New Orleans. He was traveling to Louisiana on business and had asked her to join him.</p><p>New Orleans was one of the most romantic cities in the world, and the thought of being there with Will sent her heart spinning. She imagined strolling down Bourbon Street, listening to jazz musicians with Will at her side. He\u2019d mentioned a gambling trip down the Mississippi on a riverboat, and touring historic plantations.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she typed back. She felt as nervous as she was excited.</p><p>\u201cWe should talk, and not like this. The things I want to say should be said face-to-face.\u201d His reply was instantaneous. \u201cI need you, Grace. You\u2019re all I think about.\u201d</p><p>They no longer hid their feelings from each other. Grace loved Will; it was that simple. She wanted to be with him\u2014not just for a weekend, but forever.</p><p>Still, she lived in Cedar Cove and was employed by the town. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to get time away from the library without several weeks\u2019 notice,\u201d she typed.</p><p>\u201cAsk now. I\u2019ll send you a plane ticket.\u201d</p><p>Grace closed her eyes. The way she felt about Will, and the way he seemed to feel about her, would make it impossible for them to resist each other sexually. For weeks she\u2019d dreamed of what it would be like. She\u2019d created an entire fantasy about living with Will as husband and wife. For the first time in her adult life, she\u2019d know what it was to be with a man who loved her completely. Who cherished her...</p> <p>Dan had loved her; she didn\u2019t doubt his deep affection, but he\u2019d had so little to give her. He\u2019d struggled with such grief and guilt and misery, it was all he could do to get from one day to the next. There\u2019d been almost no room for tenderness and joy in his life. Grace desperately needed both.</p><p>And Cliff\u2014he was a friend. Their relationship had been about companionship more than love, at least on her part.</p><p>Now she finally had the opportunity to know real love.</p><p>There was a problem, however, and to Grace, it was a major one.</p><p>Will was married.</p><p>\u201cWhat about your wife?\u201d she typed back. She couldn\u2019t promise to meet him, couldn\u2019t allow this relationship to continue if he remained committed to his marriage.</p><p>\u201cI told you it was over,\u201d Will typed.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia\u2019s moved out?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. I\u2019ve already seen an attorney. The divorce is amicable. We should never have married. She understands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows about us?\u201d Grace\u2019s fingers flew over the keys.</p><p>\u201cI told her there was someone else. I didn\u2019t say who it is.\u201d</p><p>Grace had kept her relationship with Will a secret, too. They spoke via e-mail every day, often more than once, and occasionally they managed a phone call. It never ceased to astonish her how much they had to talk about.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and Grace glanced irritably over her shoulder. Buttercup ambled to the door, tail wagging.</p><p>\u201cSay you\u2019ll meet me,\u201d Will urged, the words flashing across the screen. \u201cI need to know as soon as possible. Promise me you\u2019ll do everything you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise,\u201d Grace assured him, and with regret, dragged herself away from the computer when the bell rang a second time. Determined to get rid of whoever was there, she opened her door and stared at Cliff. She had to make an effort not to groan aloud.</p><p>\u201cCliff,\u201d she said, unlatching the screen and holding the door open. \u201cThis is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprise?\u201d he repeated slowly. \u201cI called last week. We made plans to spend the afternoon together.\u201d</p><p>Grace vaguely remembered the conversation, but all that lingered in her mind was her eagerness to get off the phone so she could get back on the computer and talk to Will.</p><p>\u201cOf course. It just slipped my mind. I\u2019ll be ready in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Cliff came into the living room and sat down on the sofa, frowning slightly.</p><p>\u201cI was on the computer,\u201d Grace explained. \u201cGive me a moment while I get off-line.\u201d She pulled out her desk chair and sat down. Her fingers went to the keyboard and she quickly typed out a message to Will, telling him she\u2019d request vacation time. She wouldn\u2019t know for another week or two if she\u2019d get those days off, but with all her heart she hoped it would happen. Then she explained that she had company and needed to end their conversation.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, Grace whirled around in her chair and smiled warmly at Cliff. \u201cYou must think I\u2019m an empty-headed dunce,\u201d she said brightly, hoping to disguise the fact that she\u2019d forgotten their date.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he assured her evenly. But his smile didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. Buttercup rested contentedly at Cliff\u2019s side, and as he ran his fingers through her fur, he frowned again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my coat and be back in a moment,\u201d Grace promised.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take more than a couple of minutes to grab her coat, brush her hair and apply fresh lipstick.</p><p>Cliff was still petting Buttercup when she returned. He glanced up. \u201cWhen was the last time you had Buttercup at the vet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t recall, other than the first week after she\u2019d gotten the golden retriever. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year or so,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think it might be a good idea to schedule an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Grace was immediately concerned. Buttercup was her constant companion and friend.</p><p>\u201cNo obvious reason, other than that she seems a bit lethargic,\u201d Cliff said, but his brow was creased. \u201cThere might be something wrong\u2014she doesn\u2019t seem herself. You haven\u2019t noticed any changes in her behavior, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Grace tried to think, but nothing came to mind. The truth was, she hurried home from work every night to leap onto the computer. She realized guiltily that she hadn\u2019t paid much attention to the dog since her correspondence with Will had begun. Often she didn\u2019t bother to eat dinner until eight o\u2019clock or later. Her time at home was precious because that was her only opportunity to connect with Will.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Grace asked, reaching for her purse.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Cliff said. He continued to stroke Buttercup\u2019s back, but Grace suspected he was gathering his thoughts rather than assessing her dog\u2019s health. After a moment he stood.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, unable to read his mood. This was the role she\u2019d played far too often with Dan, doing whatever she could to put him in better spirits. So many times she\u2019d failed. Seeing the same humorless expression on Cliff\u2019s face depressed her. It brought back memories of her life with Dan.</p><p>\u201cI need to ask you something,\u201d Cliff said after a long pause.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d Well, almost anything, she amended silently.</p><p>Cliff walked over to the window and stared outside. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen much of each other lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been busy,\u201d she said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cTrue, and I suppose that\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t notice earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNotice what?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHow emotionally distant you\u2019ve become.\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head, denying it. \u201cYou\u2019re imagining things.\u201d</p><p>Cliff rubbed the back of his neck and turned to face her. \u201cFunny you should use those words. That\u2019s exactly what Susan used to say to me.\u201d</p><p>Susan was his ex-wife. Grace raised her hands in a confused, helpless gesture. \u201cWhat\u2019s this all about? I thought we were going to spend the afternoon together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Cliff murmured. He straightened, and his face was austere. \u201cI can\u2019t play this game, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d She was losing patience with him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone else. You think I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s clear to me. I can tell what\u2019s happening\u2014I\u2019ve been there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she exploded in a fit of self-righteousness. \u201cHow can you say that? Even if it was true,\u201d she continued, undaunted, \u201cit\u2019s my business. You don\u2019t have any claim on me.\u201d</p><p>Cliff\u2019s smile was sad. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like this,\u201d she pleaded. Now that he was here, she was looking forward to going out with him, enjoying his company.</p><p>He shook his head as if to say he should have seen it earlier. \u201cAt first I assumed you were pulling away from me because of Dan. I gave you time to grieve for your husband, just like you asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff, please, you\u2019re making a crisis out of nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>He sounded resigned, and she briefly had the urge to walk into his arms, but Grace didn\u2019t like the way this conversation was going.</p><p>\u201cYou say there isn\u2019t anyone else in your life?\u201d Cliff challenged.</p><p>She looked him straight in the eye and lied. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\u201d No one knew about her and Will. Not even Olivia, Will\u2019s sister and her best friend. She couldn\u2019t let word get out, especially now, when Will and Georgia were in the middle of their divorce.</p><p>\u201cI was sure I was going to love you the first time we met,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cMy admiration for you grew every time we talked. You handled the situation with your missing husband honorably, refusing to get involved with me until the divorce was final. I assumed...I believed in you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgetting something, Grace.

I won\u2019t again.\u201d</p><p>Grace crossed her arms. This was getting tiresome. \u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d she said irritably.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s married, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Cliff stared hard at her. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d say such a thing!\u201d</p> <p>Cliff started for the door.</p><p>\u201cCan we leave now?\u201d she asked, relieved this inquisition was over.</p><p>His hand was on the doorknob. \u201cI think it would be best if we didn\u2019t see each other again.\u201d</p><p>Grace stared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d Her heart sank and she realized how deeply her lies had offended Cliff. As he walked out the door, Grace stood where she was, too paralyzed by shock to react.</p><p>She recovered quickly and hurried after him. \u201cCliff,\u201d she shouted. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Either he didn\u2019t hear her or he chose not to listen. Without looking back, he climbed into his vehicle and started the engine, then drove down the street and out of her life.</p> <p>Twenty</p><p>Katie\u2019s weak, mewling cry woke Maryellen abruptly. It was only quarter after one; she\u2019d been asleep for barely an hour. Her eyes flew open and she got shakily out of bed. Gently lifting Katie from her crib, Maryellen held the infant over her shoulder and was instantly alarmed. Katie had been sick and fussy for two days and two tortured, sleepless nights. Now, if anything, she seemed worse.</p><p>Maryellen had stayed home from work with her the day before. The pediatrician had put Katie on antibiotics, but she was still miserable. Although she\u2019d taken her nighttime feeding, she\u2019d promptly vomited up the milk. Now she was burning with fever, restless and irritable.</p><p>Her eyes gritty from lack of sleep, Maryellen walked the floor, but couldn\u2019t seem to comfort Katie. With effort she managed to get the six-month-old to swallow some liquid Tylenol; even that didn\u2019t seem to lower her temperature.</p><p>By 2:00 a.m. Maryellen was exhausted and frantic. She\u2019d already talked to the consulting nurse on the twenty-four-hour hot line, but she needed more than reassurance. She needed help. It was just too hard to do this alone. She hated to call Jon at this ungodly hour, but she simply couldn\u2019t cope by herself.</p><p>The phone rang five long rings, and disheartened, she was ready to replace the receiver. Clearly Jon wasn\u2019t home, which meant he was spending the night elsewhere. The thought so depressed her that she found tears springing to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered to herself. \u201cForget about him.\u201d She refused to speculate about where he was\u2014or with whom. That would only add to her misery.</p><p>Just as she was lowering the receiver, a groggy Jon answered the phone.</p> <p>\u201cThis better be good,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cJon? It\u2019s Maryellen. I\u2019m so sorry...but I didn\u2019t know where else to turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Katie. She\u2019s got quite a high fever, and is terribly congested. I took her to the pediatrician\u2019s this morning. She has bronchitis and an ear infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she on medication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t like the sound of her breathing. I already talked to the nurse on the hot line, but I\u2019m still worried. And I\u2019m so tired.\u201d Her voice trembled with emotion. With only an hour\u2019s sleep, she was at the point of exhaustion and felt incapable of making the simplest decision.</p><p>\u201cHow high is the fever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred and three, but the nurse said that\u2019s not uncommon in infants. It\u2019s her breathing that\u2019s got me worried. She coughs so much that she starts to throw up and she can\u2019t sleep and...and consequently neither can I.\u201d Maryellen fought back her tears. Two nights without rest, and she was an emotional wreck. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how much longer I can do this....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen, Katie\u2019s my daughter as well as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should take her into the emergency room?\u201d That was all she really wanted him to tell her.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s decide that together.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so calm and reasonable. Sniffling, Maryellen agreed, relieved not to be shouldering the entire responsibility for Katie\u2019s care.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Jon rang her doorbell. He took one look at Maryellen and frowned. \u201cYou should\u2019ve called me sooner.\u201d</p><p>Knowing she must look a sight, she handed Katie to him and self-consciously ran her fingers through her hair. It\u2019d been a month since she\u2019d seen Jon, other than in passing. He seemed to be avoiding her, and after the New Year\u2019s Day dinner, she\u2019d stayed clear of him, too. Seeing him now, while she felt and looked so dreadful, worsened her dismay. But with Katie this sick, Maryellen had no choice.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already on antibiotics,\u201d she explained again as Jon lovingly attempted to comfort the baby. \u201cThe doctor said it might be a day or two before she starts feeling better, but she\u2019s still got a fever and she can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>Jon gently brushed his lips over Katie\u2019s brow. \u201cI think her fever\u2019s down a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen gauged the baby\u2019s temperature by touch, using the back of her hand. He was right; Katie\u2019s forehead felt less feverish after the Tylenol.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Should we take her to the emergency room?\u201d Maryellen asked. She hated the thought of dragging Katie out in the cold and exposing her to God only knew what else, especially if it wasn\u2019t necessary. But she didn\u2019t feel confident enough to decide that on her own.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s give it an hour and see,\u201d Jon suggested.</p><p>Maryellen nodded. If Katie\u2019s fever had broken, maybe she\u2019d be able to sleep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you,\u201d Jon said.</p><p>Maryellen hadn\u2019t wanted to ask, but was so grateful she couldn\u2019t speak, afraid she\u2019d burst into tears, and merely nodded.</p><p>They shuffled Katie between them while he removed his coat, then sat down in the rocking chair with his daughter.</p><p>\u201cShe breathes more easily when someone holds her,\u201d Maryellen said, swaying with exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed,\u201d Jon told her. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us both to be up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Maryellen didn\u2019t know why she was arguing. \u201cYou\u2019ll come and get me in an hour?\u201d</p><p>Jon glanced up. \u201cDid anyone ever tell you that you\u2019re too stubborn for your own good?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said, pointing toward her bedroom.</p><p>Maryellen was too exhausted\u2014and too grateful\u2014to do anything other than nod obediently and trudge off. Being a single mother was so much more difficult than she\u2019d thought possible. She could never have imagined what it was like to walk the floors with a sick baby, to make important decisions\u2014decisions that affected her child\u2019s life and health\u2014by herself. She didn\u2019t know what she would\u2019ve done tonight without Jon.</p><p>Maryellen collapsed onto her bed, weak with a tiredness that attacked her very bones. Her head was spinning, and she was convinced she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep.</p><p>She closed her eyes\u2014and the next time she looked at the digital readout on her clock-radio, three hours had passed. Tossing aside the covers, she hurried into the living room and discovered Katie sound asleep in Jon\u2019s arms.</p><p>He opened his eyes when she walked in.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep,\u201d Maryellen whispered, hardly able to believe it. His arms must be aching from holding Katie so long. She reached for the infant, and as soon as she held her, Maryellen realized Katie was in a deep sleep.</p><p>\u201cShe seems to be over the worst of it,\u201d Jon said, following Maryellen into the baby\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Ever so gently, she placed her in the crib. When Katie turned onto her side, Maryellen pressed one hand to her daughter\u2019s back. Heat no longer radiated from the small body. \u201cThe fever\u2019s broken,\u201d she whispered, covering her with a light blanket.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Jon asked outside Katie\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cFive-thirty,\u201d she told him. \u201cStay,\u201d she urged. He looked as tired as she\u2019d felt a few hours earlier.</p><p>Jon rubbed his face with both hands and yawned. \u201cI\u2019ll take the sofa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat thing is short and lumpy. You\u2019ll be miserable.\u201d</p><p>His eyes held hers.</p><p>\u201cWe can share my bed,\u201d she said in an offhand manner, as though his spending the night was a normal occurrence. She might have sounded calm and casual, but her heart was pounding.</p><p>Jon continued to gaze at her, apparently not sure he\u2019d heard her correctly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay on my side of the bed and you stay on yours,\u201d she added matter-of-factly. She wasn\u2019t asking him to make love to her, if that was what he thought. Without waiting for an answer, she moved silently into the darkened room.</p><p>Jon still hesitated.</p><p>\u201cThose three hours are the most sleep I\u2019ve had in two nights,\u201d she said, sitting on the edge of the bed. \u201cYou make your own decision, but I\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201d She lay down and kept her back to him. Eyes closed, she pulled the covers around her shoulders.</p><p>A minute later, the mattress on the other side of the bed shifted under his weight. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep on top of the covers,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSo you won\u2019t worry about me touching you.\u201d</p><p>As if she\u2019d mind! Maryellen didn\u2019t respond, pretending she was already asleep. It wasn\u2019t long before she heard the steady rhythm of his breathing and knew he\u2019d drifted off.</p><p>Sometime later, when Maryellen woke, her bedroom was filled with light. Jon blocked her view of the clock-radio so she couldn\u2019t see the time. She lifted her head from the pillow in order to look past him. The clock told her it was almost eight. At her movement, Jon\u2019s eyes slowly opened.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered, and laid her head back on the pillow. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept,\u201d he said incredulously.</p><p>\u201cSo did Katie.\u201d They stared at each other; neither seemed capable of moving. They\u2019d only spent one night together, the night she\u2019d conceived Katie, and that seemed a lifetime ago now. Maryellen had made so many mistakes in this relationship. But he\u2019d proved to be a wonderful father to Katie and an invaluable help to Maryellen.</p><p>They\u2019d kissed several times, and with those kisses she\u2019d tried to tell him how much she\u2019d learned to appreciate him\u2014and, yes, love him\u2014but in each instance, she\u2019d come away hurt and disappointed. She so badly wanted to kiss him now....</p><p>\u201cJon.\u201d Her voice was the slightest whisper.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He moved his head closer to hers and she slowly edged toward him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soon their lips met in a soft kiss. After a moment, Jon reluctantly eased his mouth from hers. He gazed at her, eyes narrowed, as if he wasn\u2019t sure he should continue. As if he sought her permission...</p><p>Maryellen brought her lips back to his. She\u2019d practically thrown herself at him after Christmas, and he\u2019d rejected her. Her heart would break if he spurned her again.</p><p>She needn\u2019t have worried. They kissed a second time, their mouths straining while they tore at each other\u2019s clothes. Maryellen\u2019s nightgown was easy to slip off. Jon, however, had remained fully clothed. While he unbuttoned his shirt, Maryellen heard Katie in the other room.</p><p>Jon froze.</p> <p>Maryellen, too. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can get her back to sleep.\u201d Sometimes, if she gave Katie her pacifier, the baby would sleep for a few more minutes. Maryellen prayed she could convince their daughter to give her parents this rare opportunity.</p><p>As quickly and quietly as possible, Maryellen threw on her nightgown and tiptoed into Katie\u2019s room. Sure enough, as soon as she had her pacifier, Katie closed her eyes. Maryellen remained by her side and patted her back. All the while, she prayed the mood between her and Jon hadn\u2019t been destroyed. She so badly wanted to make love with him.</p><p>When she returned to the bedroom, Maryellen knew it was too late. Jon sat on the side of the bed, his back rigid as he faced the wall.</p><p>\u201cKatie\u2019s asleep,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>Kneeling on the bed, she moved behind him and wrapped her arms around his shoulders. She kissed his neck, then ran her tongue over his earlobe and felt a shiver race through him.</p><p>Jon took her hand and kissed her palm. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing Katie woke up when she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep, Jon,\u201d Maryellen said.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a good idea for us to get involved sexually,\u201d he whispered. He got up abruptly and turned to face her.</p><p>Maryellen sank back on her heels, humiliated beyond words by his rejection.</p><p>\u201cIt would be the easiest thing in the world to make love to you now, but I\u2019m not going to do it. The truth is, I don\u2019t trust you. You\u2019ve lied to me once. You tried to keep my daughter from me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore what?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Before I realized I could trust you, before I realized I love you. But she dared not tell him that.</p><p>\u201cI explained why I behaved the way I did,\u201d she said, and kept her head lowered, unable to meet his gaze. \u201cI was as honest as I knew how to be.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for a long moment. \u201cI want to be honest with you, too, Maryellen.\u201d His voice throbbed with sincerity.</p><p>Hope flared in her and she raised her eyes. He stood with his fists clenched at his sides, his face hard. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you\u2014or myself. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d she pleaded. She could see the war that raged inside him. He longed to trust her, yearned to release the burden that weighed him down. She wondered why this burden, whatever it was, hadn\u2019t troubled him a year earlier, when he\u2019d made love to her. The reason suddenly occurred to her.</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she whispered, and somehow managed to blurt out the question. \u201cAre you married?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d she cried.</p><p>Her raised voice must have startled Katie, whose loud wail shattered the tense moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her,\u201d Maryellen said, hurrying into the nursery. She picked up the baby and changed her diaper. Katie was in much better spirits, almost back to normal, which was encouraging.</p><p>When Maryellen returned to the bedroom, Jon had disappeared. She looked out the living room window just in time to see his car turn the corner. Judging by the way he drove, he couldn\u2019t get away from her fast enough.</p><p>Rosie watched Allison tackle a thick stack of pancakes at the Pancake Palace. As if aware of her mother\u2019s scrutiny, Allison glanced up and smiled. This was a chance for them to talk privately. Zach was off with Eddie on a father-son Boy Scout event and he\u2019d suggested Rosie take Allison to dinner. It\u2019d been a good idea.</p><p>At the time of the divorce, Rosie had thought she\u2019d never have anything to do with Zach again. She\u2019d known they\u2019d have to cooperate on practical matters, but beyond that, she\u2019d figured their relationship was over. Things had turned out differently than she\u2019d expected. These days, they talked frequently; in fact, they were much happier divorced. It pained her to admit that, but it was true.</p><p>\u201cAll-you-can-eat pancakes for a buck,\u201d Rosie said, reaching for the syrup dispenser once Allison had finished with it. \u201cYou certainly can\u2019t beat the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecilia says they\u2019re the best in town.\u201d</p><p>If Rosie heard the other woman\u2019s name one more time, she thought she\u2019d scream. On the other hand, she was so grateful to have her daughter back, she knew she really didn\u2019t have cause to complain.</p><p>Two bucks for dinner was about all Rosie could afford. They still had massive legal bills\u2014well, Zach did\u2014and the cost of maintaining two homes. Plus, Rosie now had the additional expenses associated with working full-time. The money situation was as bad as ever, but she\u2019d grown accustomed to stretching her pennies. \u201cSo you like the job at your father\u2019s office?\u201d The answer was obvious, but it opened the door to conversation.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t the first day,\u201d Allison confessed, grabbing her water glass and gulping down several swallows. \u201cDad was awful to be around. He was totally unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the way Rosie had heard it, but she wasn\u2019t going to contradict Allison.</p><p>\u201cThen he made Cecilia my boss, and it worked out much better.\u201d</p><p>Rosie smiled, wondering what it was about Cecilia, whom she\u2019d never met, that had influenced Allison so profoundly.</p><p>\u201cDad told you about Cecilia and her husband, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zach had also mentioned the baby Cecilia had lost. \u201cCecilia\u2019s baby was named Allison, too?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter nodded. \u201cWould it be all right if we put flowers on her grave one day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that would be very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer birthday was June 25.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should do it then,\u201d Rosie suggested.</p><p>Allison nodded again. \u201cOkay! I\u2019ll pay for them myself.\u201d She poured a generous amount of syrup on what remained of her pancakes. \u201cWe talk, you know?\u201d She looked up, as if she expected Rosie to object.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecilia\u2019s really smart, but she said she didn\u2019t always realize that. Ian was the one who convinced her she could go to college and be anything she wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I hear you say that Ian\u2019s away just now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe term is \u2018at sea,\u2019 Mom.\u201d</p><p>Rosie hid a smile. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we know anyone else who\u2019s married to someone in the navy?\u201d</p><p>Rosie had to think about that. \u201cMrs. Alman\u2019s husband is in the navy. I teach with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Allison murmured absently.</p><p>The question Rosie had wanted to ask her daughter, and dared not, clamored within her. Zach hadn\u2019t referred to Janice Lamond in weeks, and for that matter, neither had Allison. It wasn\u2019t right to grill her children about their father\u2019s activities; Rosie had promised herself she\u2019d never put them in a situation that would divide their loyalties. She\u2019d never force them to defend their father\u2014or worse, choose between their parents. The silence about the other woman confused her, but then she hadn\u2019t mentioned Bruce Peyton, either. Not that there was much to say...</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019s everything at the office?\u201d Rosie asked as nonchalantly as she could. She hoped Allison would bring up Janice\u2019s name without any prompting.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s really, really busy. Tax season is hard. He goes to work at six and he usually has to stay late. He has appointments all day. I hardly see him anymore.\u201d</p><p>Zach had always been an early riser. During tax season, he often left the house before dawn, usually while Rosie was still asleep. From experience, she knew how tired and cranky he could be at the end of the day, too.</p><p>\u201cI hope he\u2019s hired the extra help he needs,\u201d Rosie muttered.</p><p>Allison laid her fork next to her plate. \u201cMom, are you trying to find out about Mrs. Lamond?\u201d</p><p>Instant color heated Rosie\u2019s cheeks. She could deny it and almost did, but Allison was smart enough to recognize a lie. Rosie nodded. \u201cI apologize, sweetheart, I shouldn\u2019t be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe quit,\u201d Allison said as she leaned toward Rosie in a conspiratorial kind of way. A smile flashed in her daughter\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cQuit?\u201d Rosie repeated. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeeks ago. Before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Before Christmas? That was impossible. Rosie vaguely remembered Zach\u2019s saying he\u2019d given the other woman a promotion. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, didn\u2019t she get a big enough pay raise?\u201d Rosie asked. She didn\u2019t try to disguise her dislike for the other woman.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about a pay raise, but the gossip is she left without notice and Dad was really upset about it.\u201d</p><p>Rosie would just bet he was.</p><p>\u201cThe other staff members didn\u2019t like her, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d This was interesting, and contrary to what Zach had told her. He\u2019d made Janice sound like a paragon of efficiency and helpfulness, implying that no one could resist liking such a friendly, supportive person.</p><p>\u201cAt first Mrs. Lamond was really nice. That\u2019s what Mrs. Long said\u2014you know, the office manager. But then later Mrs. Lamond got all uppity with the other staff. They said she manipulated Dad to do whatever she wanted.\u201d</p><p>As if Rosie didn\u2019t already know that. \u201cI\u2019m sure she did,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you know why she quit like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one seems to have any idea.\u201d</p><p>Rosie would have derived real satisfaction from discovering the details.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to find out more?\u201d Allison asked, obviously eager to dig up dirt.</p><p>The temptation was strong, but Rosie shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>She and Allison chatted easily through dinner, laughing frequently and even reminiscing about pre-divorce days. It buoyed Rosie\u2019s spirits to have this relaxed conversation with her daughter\u2014and to learn that the Lamond woman was gone from the office.</p><p>The following afternoon, Rosie dropped by the accounting firm. She hadn\u2019t been to the office since shortly before the separation, mainly because she hadn\u2019t wanted to give Janice Lamond the opportunity to gloat.</p><p>Mary Lou Miller was at the reception desk. She looked up when Rosie stepped into the office, and her face showed surprise, followed almost immediately by genuine welcome. There\u2019d been a time when Rosie\u2019s relationship with the office staff had been pleasant and mutually respectful.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cox, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d Mary Lou said.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mary Lou.\u201d The sense of welcome was gratifying and helped ease her nervousness. Rosie hadn\u2019t mentioned to Zach that she planned to stop by. Classes were cut short for the day because of a teachers\u2019 seminar on new curriculum requirements in the areas of math and science. Rosie was exempted, since she\u2019d taken the course while updating her skills. She had a rare afternoon free. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow can I help you?\u201d Mary Lou walked over to the counter, which acted as a partition between the waiting area and the inner office. \u201cDo you want me to call Mr. Cox? Unfortunately, he\u2019s with a client at the moment, but I can let him know you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but that won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Rosie told her. \u201cI came to meet Cecilia Randall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d Mary Lou said. \u201cI\u2019ll get her right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecilia\u2019s on her break,\u201d a woman Rosie didn\u2019t recognize announced from her desk. There\u2019d been a number of changes in the office that she knew nothing about. She and Zach had often discussed office politics, but that had been BJ\u2014before Janice.</p> <p>\u201cYou can go on back to the break room, if you like,\u201d Mary Lou suggested.</p><p>That was perfect as far as Rosie was concerned. She didn\u2019t want to interrupt Cecilia while she was on the job. Her purpose was to thank her for everything she\u2019d done for Allison.</p><p>Rosie was as familiar with the layout of the office as she was her own home\u2014or what had, at one time, been the home she\u2019d lived in with Zach. These days...well, that was territory she didn\u2019t want to enter.</p><p>Just as Mary Lou had told her, Rosie found a young woman sitting at a table, reading a magazine and sipping coffee. An older woman sat at a separate table, chatting on a cell phone. Cecilia had dark curly hair that hung just above her shoulders and she didn\u2019t look more than seventeen. She glanced up when Rosie walked in.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Rosie smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Allison\u2019s mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, hi,\u201d Cecilia said, smiling back. \u201cShe talks about you a lot.\u201d</p><p>Rosie pulled out a chair and sat down at the table. She was astounded that her daughter had mentioned her at all. \u201cI just came to introduce myself and to thank you for being Allison\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy working with her.\u201d</p><p>Rosie was sure she hadn\u2019t felt that way in the beginning. \u201cI wanted you to know how much I appreciate your patience with her. She\u2019s going through a rough time, and you\u2019ve made a tremendous impression on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate your telling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Rosie said. \u201cJust working with you has made a real difference to Allison.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpending time with her has helped me, too,\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cI was only ten when my parents divorced and I remember thinking the breakup was my fault....\u201d</p><p>Rosie was immediately concerned. She\u2019d repeatedly talked to both children about this very thing, but Allison and Eddie had dismissed her questions, and after a while she\u2019d let the matter drop. Surely, Rosie prayed, her children hadn\u2019t taken on any blame for a problem that was clearly between her and Zach.</p><p>\u201cDid Allison tell you she blames herself for what happened?\u201d Rosie burst out. \u201cBecause that simply isn\u2019t true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Cecilia assured her, and held up one hand. \u201cI just meant that talking about what happened when my parents split has helped me realize I had nothing to do with their divorce. So you see, it\u2019s been a real advantage to me to look back at that episode in my own life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Rosie murmured, relieved. In retrospect, she wished she\u2019d handled so many things differently, not only with the divorce, but her marriage, too. She tried not to think about the last twelve months. What was done was done. Indulging in regrets left her feeling depressed, and she was working hard to get past those negative emotions.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my coming by like this, but I did want to thank you,\u201d Rosie said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really sweet of you to do that.\u201d Cecilia closed her magazine. \u201cDid you enjoy your dinner with Allison?\u201d</p><p>Rosie nodded. \u201cIt was great, although I almost needed a translator. Words like wicked and righteous and mad don\u2019t seem to mean what I thought they did.\u201d</p> <p>Cecilia smiled. \u201cI know. Teenagers have their own way of expressing things, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat they do.\u201d It was important Rosie leave before her daughter arrived for work. She got up, ready to head back to the front office, when Mary Lou approached her.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cox said he\u2019d like to see you,\u201d she said, sounding apologetic as she stepped aside and allowed Rosie to pass.</p><p>Zach\u2019s door was open. When Rosie walked into his office, she immediately noticed that the family photograph was no longer on the credenza, but he\u2019d displayed one of Allison and Eddie. He stood when she entered, frowning darkly. Without a word, he moved from behind his desk and shut the door, a little harder than he needed to.</p><p>Ah, so that was how it was going to be. Rosie tried not to let him intimidate her, but that was difficult.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand his anger and suppressed the urge to respond in kind. \u201cI came to talk to Cecilia. I wanted to thank her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a convenient excuse and we both know it.\u201d He was back on the other side of his desk, his expression furious.</p><p>\u201cExcuse for what?\u201d she asked, equally angry.</p><p>\u201cFinding out about Janice.\u201d</p><p>Now she understood. Zach didn\u2019t want her to know that his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d had left the company. From the little Allison had said, she knew Janice\u2019s departure hadn\u2019t been amicable.</p><p>\u201cMy visit had nothing to do with Janice and everything to do with our daughter,\u201d Rosie insisted.</p><p>\u201cSo you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s agree to disagree. I\u2019m sorry if my being here is an embarrassment. I\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Eager to escape, she turned to leave.</p><p>Zach crossed his arms over his chest and slowly exhaled. \u201cDid you learn what you wanted to know?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Rosie turned back from the door. \u201cWhat I wanted to know?\u201d she repeated. Then she realized her ex-husband was worried that she\u2019d find out what great pains he\u2019d taken to hide the truth from her all these weeks. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I did.\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s jaw went white. \u201cWhat happened between Janice and me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI learned that Cecilia Randall is a warm, generous woman who has been a wonderful friend to our daughter,\u201d she said, interrupting him. \u201cAnd I also learned that my exhusband can be a real jerk.\u201d She offered him a quavering smile, which under the circumstances was the best she could do. \u201cNo surprise there, however.\u201d</p><p>She walked out the door.</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Bob Beldon was puttering around in his wood shop in the garage, cleaning tools and putting them away, when he noticed the sheriff\u2019s vehicle in the distance. The green car was making its way along Cranberry Point; Bob wondered if Sheriff Davis was headed in his direction and what it meant if he was.</p><p>It\u2019d been a year since the John Doe had checked into Thyme and Tide and promptly gone to meet his Maker. So much of that night remained a blur in Bob\u2019s mind. Of one thing he was sure: the man, whoever he was, had evoked the recurring nightmare. As the years passed, the dream had come less and less frequently. But it had returned that night. When he woke, he\u2019d had the same sensation he always felt following the nightmare. He\u2019d been badly shaken; discovering their guest dead in the downstairs bedroom had heightened his anxiety beyond anything he\u2019d experienced in years.</p><p>Considering the number of times Sheriff Davis had stopped by since that fateful morning, Bob couldn\u2019t help feeling he was somehow a suspect. It was Davis\u2019s last visit that had led him to contact Roy McAfee. He\u2019d half expected an arrest warrant. He needed to talk to someone he trusted, someone who could help him, so\u2014at Pastor Flemming\u2019s suggestion\u2014he\u2019d gone to Roy.</p><p>Retelling the story of that day in a Vietnam jungle hadn\u2019t been easy. Peggy was the only one he\u2019d ever told. Bob didn\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to him if not for his wife, who\u2019d held him and wept with him as he relived those terrible memories. Since then\u2014until now\u2014they\u2019d never spoken of the incident again.</p><p>He peered out at the road again. Sure enough, the sheriff\u2019s car drove through the wrought-iron gate that marked the driveway to Thyme and Tide. He recognized Troy Davis at the wheel. Bob reached in his rear pocket for a clean rag and wiped his hands free of sawdust and grime.</p><p>Davis parked in back and climbed out, nodding in Bob\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cSheriff,\u201d Bob said, coming out to meet him. He extended his hand, which Troy Davis shook, all the while looking him full in the face. That was encouraging. If Davis planned to arrest him, he figured there\u2019d be some sign. Thus far, he hadn\u2019t seen any.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Bob?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeggy around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s inside baking. She\u2019s probably almost done. Cookies, I think. Do you want to come in the house?\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you both.\u201d</p><p>Bob led the way through the back door off the kitchen. As he\u2019d predicted, Peggy\u2019s cookies were cooling on wire racks and the lingering scent of oatmeal and raisins filled the room. She must\u2019ve seen Troy pull into the driveway because she\u2019d already placed three mugs on the table and had the coffee poured. She\u2019d set aside a plate of cookies, too.</p><p>Silently they each took a seat at the round oak table in the alcove next to the kitchen, then reached for a mug.</p><p>\u201cYou have news?\u201d Peggy asked.</p><p>Bob admired the fact that she got straight to the point. He assumed the sheriff had learned something. The fact that he was here in uniform told Bob this wasn\u2019t a social call.</p><p>\u201cWe have the identity of our John Doe,\u201d Sheriff Davis said. He paused as if he expected Bob to provide the name.</p><p>Peggy gasped. \u201cYou know who it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaxwell Russell.\u201d Once again, the sheriff looked at Bob.</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d Bob repeated slowly. Roy had wondered about that possibility. A chill raced down his spine, and he closed his eyes as the face of his old army buddy came to him. The room felt as if it were buckling beneath his chair. In the back of his mind, for whatever reason, he\u2019d known that the man who\u2019d died was somehow connected to his past.</p><p>\u201cYou remember him?\u201d Davis asked, but it was clear he already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cWe were in the army together\u2014that was years ago.\u201d</p><p>Davis nodded as if waiting for more.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he identify himself?\u201d Bob asked. They hadn\u2019t seen each other in nearly forty years. Max hadn\u2019t arrived on his doorstep that night by accident. He\u2019d come for a reason\u2014and died before he could tell Bob what it was.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you could give me the answer to that,\u201d the sheriff murmured.</p><p>Bob couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d never been particularly good friends with Max. They were in Vietnam together, in the jungle...in the village. Afterward all four men had gone their separate ways, desperate to put the past behind them, to forget. No one wanted a reminder of what they\u2019d done. Least of all Bob.</p><p>After the war, Bob had stayed away from Cedar Cove simply because Dan had chosen to return to their hometown. Bob did eventually move back, but the two men rarely spoke. It was as if they were strangers now, although in their youth they\u2019d been close friends. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe died before he could tell you anything?\u201d The sheriff made it a question.</p><p>Bob pushed away his chair and stood. With his back to the sheriff and Peggy, he stared out the window. \u201cNo matter how many times you ask the question, I can only answer it one way. Max came to the door without giving us so much as his name, paid for a room and said he\u2019d fill out the paperwork in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut by morning he was dead.\u201d</p><p>The sick feeling in Bob\u2019s stomach intensified. He didn\u2019t understand why Max had come to Cedar Cove in the first place. Even more of a mystery was the fact that he\u2019d had extensive plastic surgery\u2014and that he\u2019d carried false identification.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019d you find out who he was?\u201d Bob had a few questions of his own.</p><p>\u201cHis daughter filed a missing person\u2019s report with the police in Redding, California. I spoke to Hannah Russell earlier in the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia?\u201d Bob repeated. The trail had first led to an investigation in Florida, but that had quickly gone cold.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she tell you?\u201d Peggy asked before Bob could.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately not as much as I\u2019d like. The last time she spoke to her father, he told her he was leaving town. He didn\u2019t give her any details. They were apparently quite close, but when she questioned him about where he was going and why, he was evasive.</p> <p>\u201cHe never returned. After two weeks, she reported him as a missing person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all she knows?\u201d Bob turned to face the sheriff. He gripped the back of his chair and slowly released his breath. Reclaiming his seat, he mulled over the information, feeling more confused than ever.</p><p>\u201cIt seems so,\u201d Davis told him, picking up his coffee.</p><p>\u201cWas it a business trip?\u201d Bob asked next.</p><p>Davis shook his head. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t worked since the accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccident?\u201d Peggy echoed.</p> <p>\u201cHe was in a car crash five years ago. It killed his wife and badly disfigured him. The accident was the reason for his reconstructive surgery.\u201d</p><p>Well, that explained that....</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t recognize him at all,\u201d Bob murmured. He\u2019d seemed vaguely familiar\u2014his bearing, perhaps, but Bob would never have associated that stranger with the twenty-year-old he\u2019d once known.</p><p>\u201cIn the last few years, Hannah\u2019s lost both her parents. She took the news hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat poor girl,\u201d Peggy said sympathetically. \u201cShe must\u2019ve been beside herself when she didn\u2019t hear from her father all those months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder.\u201d Bob didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d spoken aloud until he heard the sound of his own voice. He leaned forward and rested his elbows on the table, splaying his fingers through his hair.</p><p>No wonder the nightmare had come that night. His subconscious had made some connection, and he\u2019d been swept into the churning memories the nightmare induced.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why Max would seek you out?\u201d Sheriff Davis asked again.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bob could only speculate.</p><p>\u201cHis daughter\u2019s coming to get the ashes.\u201d The sheriff looked from Bob to Peggy. When there was no one to claim the body or pay burial expenses, the county cremated the remains. \u201cHannah asked if she could speak to you both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you tell her?\u201d Bob asked.</p><p>\u201cI told her it was up to you, but I imagined you wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d</p><p>Peggy nodded. \u201cWhen is she coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as she can make the arrangements. She\u2019s hoping to arrive next week.\u201d</p><p>Peggy glanced at Bob. He knew what she was asking and he knew his answer, too.</p><p>\u201cTell Hannah she\u2019s welcome to stop by anytime.\u201d</p><p>The sheriff nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d</p><p>Olivia saw the huge bouquet of vibrant red roses being delivered to the courthouse when she broke for lunch. They were lovely, and in February, especially this close to Valentine\u2019s Day, they must have cost a fortune.</p><p>She followed the florist\u2019s deliveryman down the halls of the courthouse and wondered who was lucky enough to receive such gorgeous roses. When the man announced he was looking for Judge Lockhart\u2019s office, she stopped abruptly.</p><p>Someone had sent her roses?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Judge Lockhart,\u201d she said quickly, and led the way into her office. The roses were stunning, the buds just opening, their color rich and deep.</p><p>As soon as the man left, Olivia grabbed the card, certain Jack had sent them. She tore at the envelope, then hesitated when a second thought gave her pause.</p><p>They could be from Stan.</p><p>She stared hard at the half-opened envelope, and sank into her chair. She reached for the telephone, although she didn\u2019t often call Grace at work.</p><p>It took a moment to get her best friend on the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Grace asked automatically. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet.\u201d Olivia was giddy with anticipation\u2014and a hint of dread. \u201cI have the most incredible roses here and a sealed card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know who sent them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen the card,\u201d Grace urged.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re from Stan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want it to be Jack?\u201d</p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes toward the ceiling. \u201cOf course I want it to be Jack.\u201d But he\u2019d already sent her flowers once, and it had been completely out of character then. Twice would be too much to expect.</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you heard from him?\u201d</p><p>Grace always did get caught up in the details. \u201cWe talk all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he mention getting together for Valentine\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Olivia strained her memory. If he had, it was only a vague reference. \u201cNot that I recall. He\u2019s busy, I\u2019m busy. It\u2019s harder now that the paper\u2019s going to five days a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time Stan called you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t answer. \u201cThey must be from Stan,\u201d she said, already disappointed. The irony was, she couldn\u2019t remember once in all the years they were married that Stan had sent her roses.</p><p>\u201cLook at the card, would you?\u201d Grace insisted.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right.\u201d She ripped the envelope all the way open, holding her breath.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Grace said after a few tense seconds.</p><p>\u201cStan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does the card say?\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced down at it again, and with little enthusiasm read the few scribbled lines aloud. \u201c\u2018Be my Valentine now and forever. Join me for a night to remember.\u2019 And then it\u2019s signed Stan.\u201d</p><p>Grace muttered something unintelligible; whatever her friend\u2019s sentiment, Olivia shared it. If Stan had loved her so much, he wouldn\u2019t have walked out on their family when he had. He wouldn\u2019t have married Marge the moment their divorce was final. He wouldn\u2019t have abandoned Olivia in the hour of her darkest pain. Love demanded more.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet,\u201d Grace commented. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Olivia grinned. \u201cThat Jack tries, but he doesn\u2019t have a romantic bone in his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what else is new?\u201d</p><p>These days, Stan could be counted on to bring her flowers and candy, to make all the conventional gestures, but there was no substance to him. He had a handsome face and an empty heart. He seemed more worried about losing Olivia to Jack\u2014as if she was the object of some male competition\u2014than about her happiness.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you tell Stan?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to be disappointed because I\u2019ve already got a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do? But you said Jack hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about Valentine\u2019s....\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s decision had been made. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t ask me, then I\u2019ll just ask him.\u201d</p><p>Grace laughed, and it was the same wonderful sound Olivia remembered from when they were teenagers. It seemed only a few years ago that they were teenagers, talking endlessly about boys and dates and Valentine\u2019s Day. Neither of them had expected to be single at this stage of their lives.</p><p>\u201cJust when do you plan to give him this Sadie Hawkins Valentine invitation?\u201d Grace teased.</p><p>Olivia laughed, too. \u201cAs soon as I\u2019m finished here.\u201d She was about to suggest that Grace invite Cliff, as well, but that relationship had become very complicated all of a sudden. She wasn\u2019t sure what had happened, and Grace was reluctant to discuss it. Olivia gathered they\u2019d had some sort of falling out. If it wasn\u2019t cleared up after a while, she\u2019d press the issue, but at the moment, Grace seemed content. After all the grief and uncertainty her friend had been through, that was good enough for now.</p><p>They spoke for a few more minutes, Olivia promising to call Grace with an update that evening. As soon as court was over for the day, she drove directly to the newspaper. The Cedar Cove Chronicle office was situated on Cedar Cove Drive, toward Southworth, where Washington state ferries transported cars and passengers to Vashon Island and West Seattle.</p><p>Once she\u2019d parked, Olivia lost her nerve. She was part of a generation raised to believe that men did the inviting. Etiquette dictated certain procedures, and even though many of those rules were outdated in today\u2019s world, they were so ingrained, Olivia had a hard time ignoring them.</p><p>Well, she\u2019d come here for a reason, and she was determined to see it through. She marched purposefully into the office, only to discover he was in a meeting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him if you like,\u201d the receptionist told her.</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Thankfully Olivia didn\u2019t have time to formulate a response.</p><p>The door to the back office opened and Jack walked out, wearing a preoccupied frown. But the instant he saw her, his eyes brightened and his step quickened. \u201cOlivia!\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s delight at seeing her seemed to infuse him with energy, and Olivia felt gratified. He held out his hands to her. \u201cThis is a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a Valentine,\u201d she announced. \u201cAre you interested?\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cYeah, except...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d If he told her he already had a date, she\u2019d hit him with her purse.</p><p>\u201cI take it you want to go someplace other than the Taco Shack for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the Taco Shack, but...\u201d It occurred to her then that Jack was nervous. He was afraid he wouldn\u2019t meet her expectations. She also knew he wasn\u2019t about to admit it.</p><p>\u201cAll right, the Taco Shack is out.\u201d He paused, as though searching his limited repertoire of restaurants. \u201cThere\u2019s always The Lighthouse, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me make the reservations,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Jack grinned slyly in her direction. \u201cAre you romancing me, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She couldn\u2019t see any reason to deny it. \u201cSo, are you interested or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet I am.\u201d He draped his arm around her shoulder. \u201cCan you have dinner with me tonight, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaco Shack?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jack nodded. \u201cThey make a mean enchilada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I make a mean chicken pot pie,\u201d she said, tempting him with her cooking. Jack ate far too many meals in restaurants. \u201cSee you in an hour?\u201d</p><p>Jack nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve got some work to finish up. How about two hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds great,\u201d she said. Her spirits soared as she drove home, planning the rest of her menu.</p> <p>Jack was only ten minutes late, and by then she had salad made, the table set and the pie waiting on top of the stove. She greeted him with an enthusiastic kiss. Sliding his arms around her waist, he held her a moment longer than necessary.</p><p>\u201cI could get used to this,\u201d Jack said, following her into the kitchen. The chicken pie smelled savory and enticing, the crust a perfect golden-brown.</p><p>\u201cSo could I,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>Jack had intended to go back to the office, but he stayed instead, and they cuddled up on the sofa and watched television. At eleven, Olivia reluctantly kissed him good-night at the door, then wandered into her bedroom, feeling contented and relaxed. She looked forward to another evening like this one; they\u2019d be having dinner again soon, on Valentine\u2019s Day, and she was already thinking about possible restaurants.</p><p>When she woke the next morning, it was because she\u2019d heard a noise. Then she heard it again. It seemed to be coming from the kitchen. Frowning, Olivia sat up in bed. Reaching for her housecoat at the end of the bed, she slipped her arms into the sleeves, then hurried downstairs.</p> <p>To her dismay, she found Stan sitting at the kitchen table, drinking coffee and reading the Seattle morning paper. After the divorce, she hadn\u2019t bothered to change the locks, but she couldn\u2019t believe that, all these years later, Stan still had a key. Perhaps she\u2019d forgotten to lock the door when she said goodbye to Jack.</p><p>\u201cStan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d he said, as if he sat in her kitchen each and every day.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He set the coffee mug down. \u201cSorry if I startled you. I was in the neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was so furious she could barely speak. How dared he enter her home without permission!</p> <p>\u201cDid you get my roses?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Olivia ignored the question. \u201cWhat are you doing in my home?\u201d She emphasized the fact that this house was hers; he no longer had any rights to it. Or to her...</p><p>He gave her that hurt-little-boy look she knew so well. \u201cYou\u2019re upset, aren\u2019t you?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea for you to sneak into my home like...like a thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI apologize, Olivia. Now, please, don\u2019t be angry with me. You know I hate it when you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>Olivia refused to fall victim to his cajoling. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to happen again. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, then smiled as though she was the most enthralling woman in the world. \u201cNow, tell me, did you receive the roses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go out with me on Valentine\u2019s, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Stan, I won\u2019t. I think it\u2019s time you finished your coffee and left.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI think you\u2019re actually glad to see me, but you won\u2019t admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Stan, I am not glad to see you. Now, would you kindly leave.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Two</p><p>Zach replaced the telephone receiver and sighed heavily. Dashing off to the grade school because Eddie had been in a fight was not how he\u2019d planned to spend his afternoon. However, the school had phoned him, and he didn\u2019t have any choice.</p><p>He called Cecilia into his office. \u201cPlease cancel my three o\u2019clock appointment, apologize and reschedule as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia nodded. She seemed shocked when he reached for his briefcase and collected his coat. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes.\u201d</p><p>In other circumstances he would\u2019ve phoned Rosie and asked her to deal with the situation. Eddie was an easygoing boy and not prone to fistfights. Whatever had caused the altercation, Zach was convinced it hadn\u2019t been Eddie\u2019s fault.</p><p>Since his blowup with Rosie in the office that day, Zach hadn\u2019t been in contact with her. He felt bad about it, especially when Cecilia had told him how much she\u2019d enjoyed meeting Rosie. Zach felt guilty for leaping to conclusions, but what else was he to think when he\u2019d heard Rosie was busy chatting with Cecilia? Naturally enough, he\u2019d assumed she was grilling his assistant for information about Janice.</p><p>Only later, after his outburst, did he realize he\u2019d made an idiot of himself. It wasn\u2019t the first time and it probably wouldn\u2019t be the last. In any event, they were divorced, so it shouldn\u2019t bother him as much as it did. Still...</p><p>Zach got into his car and started the engine. He placed his hands on the steering wheel as an uneasy feeling settled in the pit of his stomach. He\u2019d made a mistake, and that mistake had cost him his marriage. Lessons didn\u2019t come easy to him; he was still too impulsive, too ready to assume the worst\u2014and act on it. He owed Rosie an apology, but she\u2019d avoided him, and frankly, he was grateful.</p><p>As Zach pulled into the school parking lot, he decided he should\u2019ve called Rosie and asked her to deal with this situation, after all. She was closer to the grade school, and knew the principal. Actually, he was surprised that the authorities had notified him instead of her.</p><p>The school was filled with kid noises when he opened the main doors\u2014classes were being released for afternoon recess. Just as Zach walked into the building, a couple of hundred students shot out the doors. He couldn\u2019t move until they\u2019d rushed past, and found himself standing there like a rock in a fast-flowing stream. As soon as the halls had emptied, he made his way to the principal\u2019s office.</p><p>Mr. Durrell, the principal, came out of his office once his secretary had announced Zach\u2019s arrival.</p><p>The two men shook hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d Zach asked.</p><p>Durrell brought him into the other room. A petulant Eddie sat on a sofa, his shoulders slumped forward. He stared down at the floor, glancing up briefly when Zach entered. Eddie had a bruise on the side of his face and his eyes were red from crying.</p><p>The principal sat at his desk and Zach took the seat next to his son. Eddie wasn\u2019t a fighter, and Zach couldn\u2019t imagine what had happened to bring him to blows with another student. Zach placed his arm protectively around Eddie\u2019s shoulders. His son leaned into Zach\u2019s strength for a moment, but then caught himself and stiffened.</p><p>\u201cEddie was involved in a fistfight earlier today,\u201d Mr. Durrell explained. \u201cThe other boy claims Eddie threw the first punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEddie?\u201d Zach asked, waiting to hear his son\u2019s version of events.</p><p>\u201cEddie refuses to answer my questions,\u201d the principal said.</p><p>Zach turned to look at his boy. \u201cIs it true, Eddie?\u201d he asked gently. \u201cDid you throw the first punch?\u201d</p><p>Eddie sniffled and wiped his nose with one sleeve. He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good explanation,\u201d Zach told the principal. \u201cEddie\u2019s never been in any fights before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Principal Durrell said, \u201cand that\u2019s what concerns me. This is out of character for Edward. I\u2019m willing to overlook the incident this time, but I want assurances that it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cThe reason I phoned you, Mr. Cox, is that this is serious. I want you to know that if Edward takes part in a second fight, I won\u2019t have any choice but to expel him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I give you a few minutes to talk, and then the three of us can discuss the matter before I bring in Christopher Lamond.\u201d Mr. Durrell stood and walked out of the room.</p><p>At the mention of Janice\u2019s son, Zach\u2019s head snapped up and his mouth went dry. As he sorted out his thoughts, Zach heard the sound of children\u2019s laughter drifting in from outside. A bell rang, and the thunder of feet signaled that recess was over. Suddenly the halls were quiet.</p><p>\u201cYou want to tell me what happened?\u201d Zach asked once he\u2019d regained his composure.</p><p>Eddie\u2019s shoulders had slumped so far forward, his forehead almost touched his knees. He sniffled again, then gradually straightened. \u201cChris said...his mom used to be your girlfriend, and that\u2019s why you and Mom don\u2019t live together anymore.\u201d</p><p>Zach felt as if he\u2019d been hit square in the chest. The impact was so jarring he nearly placed his hand over his heart. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Chris, but he wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d Eddie shook his head. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have hit him, but he wouldn\u2019t shut up and he kept shouting it and finally...I had to make him stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll happen the next time, Eddie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d Eddie repeated, \u201cI\u2019m going to look him in the eye and tell him it isn\u2019t true and then I\u2019ll walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d Zach ruffled his son\u2019s hair. \u201cYou want me to beat him up for you?\u201d he teased.</p><p>The hint of a smile touched Eddie\u2019s mouth. \u201cDad!\u201d</p><p>Zach nudged him with his elbow and Eddie nudged him back. After a couple more elbow exchanges, the door opened and Mr. Durrell returned. The three of them talked for a few minutes, and then the principal brought in the other boy. Chris refused to look at Zach. After the two boys had apologized, Mr. Durrell instructed Eddie and Christopher to go back to their respective classrooms.</p><p>Zach was about to suggest Eddie come home with him, but he realized it was better that his son face his class and his friends sooner rather than later.</p><p>Zach thanked Mr. Durrell and left. He pitied Chris Lamond, suspecting that Janice had paraded a number of men through her son\u2019s life. He\u2019d almost been one of them. Zach was halfway to the parking lot when he recognized Rosie. She was dressed in a straight skirt and matching jacket and looked...professional. Sharp and savvy. He wasn\u2019t used to seeing her like this, and it made him feel a bit odd, as though she\u2019d somehow become someone different. When she noticed him, she paused momentarily. Then, with her chin held high, she continued toward the school.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been to see Mr. Durrell,\u201d Zach said when their paths crossed.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe school secretary called to tell me Eddie had been in a fight. I thought I\u2019d better find out what happened. That just isn\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Durrell phoned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d be able to come. I know how busy you are this time of year and I managed to leave a few minutes early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou assumed I wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d Zach was mildly offended that she\u2019d expected him to put his work schedule ahead of his son\u2019s needs. He might be lacking in a lot of other areas, but Zach prided himself on being a good father.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, I knew you\u2019d come. I just figured that it\u2019d be later, and I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea for Eddie to sit in Mr. Durrell\u2019s office all afternoon.\u201d She gave a quick shrug. \u201cI was wrong\u2014you obviously came over here right away.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wondered if she\u2019d said this just to prove she had no trouble admitting when she was at fault. Fine, he could do it, too.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of assumptions,\u201d Zach said, looking past his ex-wife. He owed her this, even if it meant humiliating himself in the process. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to leap to conclusions.\u201d He glanced at Rosie to see if she got his point.</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>It should be obvious, but apparently she wanted him to spell it out. \u201cThe way I assumed you were talking to Cecilia to pump her for information about Janice.\u201d</p> <p>Rosie stared at him. Then she frowned as if she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d heard him correctly. \u201cAre you apologizing, Zachary Cox?\u201d</p><p>Zach clenched his jaw and nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m apologizing. I was out of line that day.\u201d</p><p>Her face relaxed, and she offered him a soft, almost shy smile. Then she said, \u201cThank you, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor admitting you were wrong. I know how hard it is for you to do that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d He didn\u2019t think he was that bad, just reluctant at times. Still, he\u2019d gotten worse once his marriage began to fall apart. Although maybe that was why his marriage had fallen apart\u2014or at least a contributing factor.</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounded self-righteous of me, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Rosie laughed and shook her head.</p><p>It was easy to forgive her when she was so willing to laugh at herself. He smiled in response, feeling a connection with her that he hadn\u2019t felt in nearly two years.</p><p>\u201cI owe you an apology, too,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d They\u2019d waged war over a comma in their divorce papers. Their weapons had been highly paid attorneys. During the bitter months preceding the divorce, there\u2019d been no interchange that wasn\u2019t witnessed and presided over by those same attorneys. Yet here was Rosie, standing with him in a school parking lot, and they were having one of the most important conversations of their relationship.</p><p>\u201cI apologize for assuming you were involved with Janice,\u201d Rosie continued. \u201cI convinced myself that you were having an affair and I turned into a vindictive shrew. I\u2019m not proud of the things I said and did, and I apologize.\u201d</p> <p>Zach had never expected Rosie to do anything like this. For months she\u2019d been filled with resentment and vicious anger. Now he saw the tears of regret in her eyes, and his own heart softened.</p><p>\u201cRosie...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou denied the affair from the beginning,\u201d she went on, barely able to speak through her tears. \u201cI never had any real proof. I\u2019d decided it was happening, felt it must be. She was obviously attractive and capable, and you spent eight hours a day with her. I was insanely jealous.\u201d</p><p>Zach swallowed hard. He looked toward the school, sick at heart. Even now, months after his divorce, Janice haunted his life. Today his son had even fought with hers. She wasn\u2019t to blame for the death of his marriage, but she wasn\u2019t exactly a disinterested bystander. Janice\u2019s attention had flattered him; he\u2019d liked the way she\u2019d catered to him, liked it far more than he should have. And she\u2019d been well aware of that....</p><p>Clearly embarrassed by her loss of control, Rosie shoved the hair away from her face. \u201cI apologize for the ugly things I said, for the way I behaved.\u201d</p><p>The school bell rang, but they both ignored it.</p><p>\u201cRosie, listen, I was as much at fault as you. More so,\u201d Zach confessed. \u201cI should never have let things go on as long as they did. I was wrong, dead wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me finish,\u201d he said, fearing he\u2019d lose his courage if he didn\u2019t say it now. \u201cI wasn\u2019t physically involved with Janice, but I did care about her. And I relied on her.\u201d</p><p>Zach held his breath a moment. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with Janice, although it might have gone that way eventually\u2014it was definitely what she wanted. But I did become emotionally dependent on her.\u201d</p><p>He watched as the color drained from Rosie\u2019s face. He wanted to explain what he meant, but by then the school busses had rolled into the parking lot, belching smoke and diesel fumes.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Eddie shouted, running toward them. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d Zach promised, but he could see from the shock in Rosie\u2019s eyes that she wasn\u2019t ready to discuss Janice. For that matter, he wasn\u2019t eager to bring up the subject again\u2014ever.</p><p>Grace was breathing hard as she followed the aerobics instructor. \u201cOne, two, one, two, three. Come on, ladies! Pick up the pace.\u201d She groaned at the young woman\u2019s words; she could barely keep up with the other members of her Wednesday night class as it was. She had conceded a long time ago that Olivia was far more agile than she was. The only reason she\u2019d signed up for this class was so she could count on seeing her best friend at least once a week. By now, three years later, she\u2019d figured all these exercises would\u2019ve gotten easier. Not so.</p><p>Back in the locker room, Grace felt convinced she was losing whatever ground she\u2019d gained. The problem was, this was her only exercise program. Like it or not, she needed the class.</p><p>She used to take a brisk walk along the waterfront at lunchtime, especially on sunny days. Now she ate her lunch in front of the computer at the library. At home it was the same thing. If Will wasn\u2019t online when she logged on, he almost always had a message waiting for her. She\u2019d come to live for his messages. She\u2019d let so many things slide, and all because of Will. She feared their online relationship had become an obsession, but recognizing that did nothing to change the way she felt about him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why I do this to myself,\u201d Grace complained as she slumped onto the bench in the locker room.</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t even out of breath, whereas Grace was panting. Her hair was plastered to her head and her face felt hot. This couldn\u2019t be good for her, although according to the pencil-thin group leader, she was doing wonderful things for her heart. Wanna bet?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to seed, Gracie-girl,\u201d Olivia teased.</p><p>Grace rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>Olivia braced her tennis shoe against the bench and untied it. \u201cNot me. Say, you never did tell me what you did on Valentine\u2019s Day.\u201d Olivia sank down on the bench next to Grace.</p><p>\u201cNothing much. I stayed home.\u201d She didn\u2019t have anything exciting to report. In fact, her night had gotten off to a slow start.</p><p>Olivia wiped her face with a towel. \u201cBeing alone didn\u2019t bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least.\u201d Grace shrugged. \u201cI enjoy my own company.\u201d Yes, at first she\u2019d been a bit down, since Will hadn\u2019t been available, but eventually she was able to talk to him. He\u2019d e-mailed her later than usual. He\u2019d stayed at the office finishing up a report so he could leave for New Orleans the following week. Grace didn\u2019t dare think about that. After all this time, she was actually going to be in Will\u2019s arms. She\u2019d dreamed of this in high school and only recently confessed to him how she\u2019d felt back then.</p><p>The plane ticket he\u2019d mailed her waited on her dresser, where she gazed at it every day, imagining the pleasures to come. For his part, Will had made her a number of promises. This first time would be as special as he could make it. Soon they\u2019d have a life together. Will hadn\u2019t wanted to discuss the details but said they\u2019d go over all of that once she arrived.</p><p>\u201cDid you and Jack have a good time?\u201d Grace asked in order to turn her thoughts from Will.</p><p>\u201cWe had a fabulous time,\u201d Olivia said, with a long, drawn-out sigh.</p><p>\u201cDid he get you flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d Olivia arched her eyebrows dramatically. \u201cOnce a year is about all I should expect from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did buy you that tennis bracelet for your birthday last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd gave it to me weeks late,\u201d she recalled.</p><p>Olivia loved that bracelet; she wore it almost constantly.</p><p>\u201cIf you must know, Jack bought me two tickets to the Sonics basketball game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d Grace loved the way Jack could make Olivia smile. It was just like him to buy her a gift he wanted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right, I outsmarted him,\u201d Olivia assured her. \u201cI bought him a facial at the health spa.\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head and marveled that her friend could get exactly what she wanted and do it in such a clever manner. \u201cYou two are getting along better than ever, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Olivia nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t believe how silly I was to make demands on him. And that stupid ultimatum\u2014I should\u2019ve known better. I was such a fool to consider getting back with Stan.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cI\u2019m in love with Jack.\u201d</p><p>Grace was thrilled for her. This really was good news, but it wasn\u2019t something she hadn\u2019t figured out herself. Olivia\u2019s feelings for Jack were obvious. While Grace had similar news concerning Will, she wasn\u2019t free to share it. But she would the minute his divorce was final.</p><p>Grace had told Olivia everything nearly her entire life. The urge to tell her dearest friend about her plans with Will was almost overwhelming, but she couldn\u2019t. Soon, though. Very soon. According to Will, his wife had moved out and the divorce was all but over. The legalities couldn\u2019t be settled quickly enough to suit Grace.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you Mom heard from Will? He\u2019s worried about this protest rally she\u2019s organizing. He\u2019s going to be out of town next week, but he\u2019s planning to call and give her his two cents\u2019 worth.\u201d</p><p>Grace already knew he\u2019d be in New Orleans. What Olivia didn\u2019t know was that Will would be with her. She was a bit surprised that Olivia avoided mentioning his divorce, but she was probably waiting until it was final before she said anything, which was understandable.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to take a cruise one day,\u201d Olivia said dreamily.</p><p>Grace frowned. \u201cA cruise. What\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Olivia glanced at her. \u201cMy brother. He and Georgia booked a cruise this summer in the South Pacific.\u201d</p><p>It felt as if her heart had stopped beating. \u201cWill\u2019s taking a cruise with his wife?\u201d she asked, just to be certain she\u2019d heard Olivia correctly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve gone on several over the years. Will says it\u2019s the only way to travel.\u201d</p><p>This was a mistake; it had to be. Will and Georgia were in the middle of a divorce. Will couldn\u2019t have misled Grace like this, couldn\u2019t have lied to her...not after the things he\u2019d promised. She didn\u2019t believe it. She absolutely refused to accept it.</p><p>Somehow Grace managed to remain in one piece until she got back to the house. Buttercup was waiting for her as usual, but Grace ran past the dog and reached for the phone. Her hand trembled so badly she nearly dropped the receiver.</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t just call him out of the blue like this. After all these months of communicating online, she didn\u2019t even know his home number. He was always the one who phoned her. With finances so tight, she couldn\u2019t afford lengthy long-distance conversations, and Will knew that. She needed to think this through before she made accusations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Perhaps it was all a big misunderstanding. Will didn\u2019t want his family to find out about the impending divorce; that was it. Naturally, after all these years, it would be difficult for him to tell his mother and sister that his marriage was a failure.</p><p>Of course, Grace reasoned, that had to be it. Instantly she felt better, but no matter how hard she struggled to find reassurance, she couldn\u2019t sleep. At midnight, she got up, turned on the computer and went online; no new messages from him. At one, with a pounding headache, she took an aspirin and crawled back into bed. At two, she still couldn\u2019t sleep. Nor at three. Doubts invaded her mind. The fact that Will had insisted she not let Olivia know they were talking online, the secrecy of it, had always bothered her.</p><p>Olivia rarely mentioned her brother. He lived on the other side of the country, so his name didn\u2019t often enter the conversation. He hadn\u2019t lived in Cedar Cove since his early twenties. People changed.</p><p>She had to know.</p> <p>At three-thirty, when the night was at its darkest and dawn only an unfulfilled promise, Grace picked up her bedside phone. She got Will\u2019s home phone number from directory assistance. With the time difference, he would be awake, just getting ready for the office.</p><p>The phone was answered on the first ring. A female voice, sounding depressingly cheerful.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the Will Jefferson residence?\u201d</p><p>A short hesitation. \u201cYes, this is Mrs. Jefferson. May I ask who\u2019s calling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is Grace Sherman from Cedar Cove, Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hi. My husband\u2019s from Cedar Cove. I hope everything\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Could I speak to Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll get him for you right away.\u201d</p><p>Grace thought she was going to be physically ill. She closed her eyes and concentrated on taking deep breaths.</p><p>A moment later Will picked up the phone. \u201cHello.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHello, Will. It\u2019s Grace.\u201d She paused to let the words sink in. \u201cYou aren\u2019t getting a divorce, are you? That was your wife who answered the phone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a good time to talk. I\u2019ll explain later.\u201d He sounded annoyed with her.</p><p>\u201cAn explanation won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t give him a chance to respond. \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to contact me again.\u201d How calm she sounded, Grace mused. And yet her heart was racing and her mouth was dry. \u201cI\u2019ll return the plane ticket and if you ever try to get in touch with me again, I\u2019m going straight to Olivia and your mother. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>Grace could hear his wife speaking in the background, worried that something was wrong with his mother. \u201cI understand,\u201d he said, and then quietly replaced the receiver.</p><p>At eight o\u2019clock, Grace phoned the library and reported that she was sick. It wasn\u2019t a stretch of the imagination. Every flu symptom she\u2019d ever experienced hit her, all at the same time. She fell into bed, pulled the sheets over her head, trying to shut out the world.</p><p>She\u2019d been so gullible, so trusting and naive. Will was her best friend\u2019s brother and not once did she suspect that he\u2019d ever do anything this underhanded or deceitful\u2014especially to her. The fact that he\u2019d lied was bad enough, but that he\u2019d preyed on her heart was nothing short of cruel. He\u2019d lured her to New Orleans, paid for the flight and planned an erotic, exotic weekend for the two of them. She wondered what he\u2019d intended to do once she learned he wasn\u2019t divorcing his wife. Apparently he\u2019d assumed he could keep her dangling like this indefinitely. And he probably could have, except for a chance remark of his sister\u2019s.</p> <p>So she was stupid, too...Because it was now abundantly clear that Will had no intention of leaving his wife, especially for her. With her high school crush on him, Grace had been a willing victim.</p><p>Even though she was dizzy and sick to her stomach, Grace turned on her computer and blocked Will\u2019s name and e-mail address. Never again would he be able to contact her online. Anything he sent her would be automatically returned.</p><p>Midmorning, Grace fell into a fitful sleep. She woke in the afternoon, and found Buttercup lying on the bedroom floor. \u201cWhat is it, girl?\u201d Grace asked. \u201cDo you have a broken heart, too?\u201d</p><p>Buttercup didn\u2019t respond, didn\u2019t even wag her tail. Grace walked over to her, crouched down beside her, and immediately realized something was terribly wrong. Stroking the dog\u2019s head, she grabbed the phone and called the vet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter with her,\u201d she told the receptionist. \u201cBut please get me in as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Luckily there was an appointment available that afternoon. Grace dressed in sloppy jeans, ran a brush through her hair and loaded Buttercup in the car, then drove to the animal clinic as fast as she dared.</p><p>Weeks earlier, Cliff had mentioned that there might be a problem with Buttercup\u2019s health. Why hadn\u2019t she paid more attention? Why had she ignored what was right before her eyes? The answer was too painful to examine. Grace knew why. She\u2019d neglected her dog because of Will.</p><p>While Grace sat in the waiting area, she felt sick with guilt. She\u2019d let her friend down. The door to the clinic opened and, to her dismay, in walked Cliff Harding. Tall, dark, ruggedly good-looking, he seemed to energize the compact waiting area. A woman with a large cat on a leash sat up straighter and smiled enticingly. An older man with a terrier grinned and exchanged a few remarks.</p><p>Grace shrank as far as she could into the corner and prayed he hadn\u2019t seen her. Looking as bad as she did, maybe he wouldn\u2019t recognize her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Harding.\u201d The receptionist perked up. Cliff was obviously a favorite. \u201cThe medication you ordered is in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d he said, sauntering to the counter. He good-naturedly teased the girl, who blushed with pleasure. One of the assistants from the back must have heard Cliff\u2019s voice, because she made an excuse to slip out front. She was about Grace\u2019s age and flirted openly with him.</p><p>Grace lowered her head and pretended to read a magazine. From the corner of her eye, she watched as Cliff paid for the worming medication he needed for his horses and turned to leave.</p><p>While he might not have recognized her, he didn\u2019t have any problem remembering Buttercup.</p><p>He shoved his wallet in his back pocket and for a moment she thought he might do them both a favor and walk away. No, that would\u2019ve been entirely too easy. Instead he walked across the room and stood directly in front of her.</p><p>\u201cHello, Grace.\u201d</p><p>She put down the magazine as if noticing him for the first time. \u201cOh\u2014hello, Cliff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Buttercup?\u201d he asked. Bending down on one knee, he gently placed his hand beneath the golden retriever\u2019s jaw and looked into her eyes. \u201cWhat does Doc Newman say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in to see her yet.\u201d</p><p>A frown darkened his face. \u201cThis is your first visit?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. He didn\u2019t need to say anything more; she read the censure in his eyes, felt the reprimand. She wanted to defend herself\u2014but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>After a moment, he stood and stared down at her. \u201cI hope you aren\u2019t too late.\u201d He touched the brim of his hat in farewell and strode out the door.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>It\u2019d been three weeks since Maryellen had seen Jon, other than in passing. She\u2019d gotten quite good at inventing reasons for him to linger when he came to collect Katie, but he always had an excuse to leave almost as soon as he arrived.</p><p>The unspoken message that he no longer wanted to be part of her life was beginning to sink into her stubborn heart. The more she obsessed over his behavior, the more convinced she became that there was someone else.</p><p>For the most part, Maryellen was able to hide her pain and disappointment from those closest to her. Her sister was busy and involved in her marriage. These days Kelly was preoccupied with getting pregnant a second time and seemed oblivious to anything outside her own small world. Not that Maryellen was complaining. If their circumstances had been reversed, she probably would\u2019ve done the same.</p><p>Her mother was a different story. In the last year, Maryellen had felt closer to her mother than anyone, but that, too, had changed and for reasons she didn\u2019t understand. While Maryellen was pregnant with Katie, she\u2019d had many wonderful talks with her mother. But lately, Grace had been distracted, and Maryellen felt excluded from her mother\u2019s life.</p><p>Oddly, the one person she could confide in was her nail tech. Rachel had been working on Maryellen\u2019s nails for three years; during that time, she\u2019d become both confessor and counselor.</p><p>There was something liberating about sitting across from Rachel like this. The minute Rachel reached for her hands, it was as if an emotional wall lowered between them. Despite the privileged nature of their relationship, their time together was limited to these occasional appointments.</p><p>What she couldn\u2019t tell her mother and sister, she could discuss with Rachel. It was Rachel who\u2019d first guessed that she was pregnant, although Maryellen had worked hard to keep it a secret for as long as possible. And Rachel was the first to recognize that Maryellen had fallen in love with Jon, something she\u2019d barely acknowledged to herself. Rachel\u2019s insight and practical wisdom had been a special gift these last few weeks.</p><p>February wound to a close. Maryellen sat across from Rachel for her nail appointment; when she looked up, she found Rachel studying her intently.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Maryellen stretched out her hands.</p><p>Rachel frowned. \u201cI wondered, but now I know. You didn\u2019t hear from Jon, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d Maryellen tried to make a joke of it and failed.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rachel lifted Maryellen\u2019s hands for inspection. \u201cLook at these nails! They\u2019re a disaster. I can always tell when something\u2019s troubling you by looking at your fingernails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d She\u2019d chipped the polish on two nails and broken another. Rachel was right; she was a mess and in more ways than one.</p><p>Rachel nonchalantly reached for a cotton ball and polish remover. \u201cI saw Jon the other day, down by the waterfront with Katie. I think it\u2019s so cute the way he hauls her around on his back, all bundled up and everything. He had his camera around his neck.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen had seen Jon with Katie in exactly that way a dozen times. She marveled at what a good father he was. She felt sure that Katie would love the outdoors with the same energy and enthusiasm as Jon.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Katie, how\u2019s she doing?\u201d Rachel asked. \u201cLast time you were in, she\u2019d just gotten over a cold and an ear infection. Poor little thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s much better.\u201d A fact for which Maryellen was eternally grateful. Katie\u2019s illness had been a nightmare for her. She was astonished by how well she\u2019d managed to function on so little sleep. Not that she wanted to try it again anytime soon. \u201cKatie\u2019s crawling around like crazy. I\u2019ll bet she starts walking early.\u201d</p><p>Rachel sighed and vigorously rubbed the Forever French polish from Maryellen\u2019s fingertips. \u201cI\u2019d love to have a baby. I\u2019m telling you, Maryellen, that biological clock of mine is getting louder than Big Ben. I\u2019m almost thirty, and if I don\u2019t meet someone soon, I have a feeling I never will.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Men or the lack thereof was a frequent topic between them. Rachel liked to say that her chances of meeting eligible men in a hair-and-nail shop were equivalent to losing weight on a diet of hot fudge sundaes. She\u2019d done the bar scene, hung around at all the \u201cguy\u201d places. A year ago, she\u2019d even enrolled in a mechanics class at the community college. Not a single date had come as a result of all that effort, and Rachel was discouraged.</p><p>\u201cAnytime you want to borrow Katie for a fix, let me know,\u201d Maryellen told her.</p><p>\u201cI just might.\u201d Rachel dumped the used cotton balls in the garbage and picked up her file. \u201cEnough about my pathetic love life, let\u2019s talk about you and Jon.\u201d</p><p>As if there was anything to talk about. \u201cUnfortunately, it all seems pretty hopeless.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>There was no easy way to answer that question. She hadn\u2019t intended to tell Rachel what she suspected, but the words were out before she could stop them. \u201cI think he\u2019s involved with someone else.\u201d</p><p>Rachel looked up and held Maryellen\u2019s gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen mumbled a response, her head lowered. This was humiliating enough without inviting the entire shop to listen in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rachel asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p> <p>Embarrassed, Maryellen said, \u201cI practically threw myself at him not once, but twice\u2014and Jon turned me down both times.\u201d She spoke in a hoarse whisper. The morning they\u2019d awakened next to each other and he\u2019d moved away from her had been a low point for Maryellen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean,\u201d Rachel whispered back heatedly. \u201cIf Jon didn\u2019t love you, he\u2019d have taken what you offered, and just enjoyed himself. Then he would\u2019ve left without a backward glance. But, you\u2019ll notice, Jon didn\u2019t do that. He exhibited self-control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Maryellen demanded. If Jon truly loved her, she\u2019d know it; she\u2019d feel it. If he did care for her, she wouldn\u2019t have felt so utterly devastated when he walked away.</p><p>\u201cThat I can\u2019t answer,\u201d Rachel murmured as she continued to file Maryellen\u2019s nails.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s seeing one of the women he works with,\u201d Maryellen said, and her heart grew heavy at the thought. The Lighthouse employed lots of single women who worked as waitresses. There were others in the kitchen. And his photographs were gaining more and more attention. Maryellen had been around the artists\u2019 community long enough to know how attractive women found creative men.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no one else,\u201d Rachel said, with such conviction that several heads turned in their direction.</p> <p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>Rachel concentrated on her filing. \u201cI wish I could give you definite proof. I can\u2019t, but I\u2019m convinced he loves you.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it was wishful thinking, but Maryellen desperately wanted to believe that, too.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Rachel said suddenly. \u201cHere\u2019s a thought. You could always ask him if there\u2019s someone else.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen immediately shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...because...\u201d Maryellen couldn\u2019t think of a reason quickly and found herself stuttering. \u201cIt\u2019s out of the question,\u201d she said with finality.</p><p>Rachel paused again. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to know, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Maryellen gaped at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re afraid of the truth,\u201d Rachel insisted.</p><p>Maryellen started to defend herself and then admitted Rachel was right\u2014she was afraid.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that can happen?\u201d Rachel said next. \u201cMy mother used to ask me that whenever I had a problem. It always got me thinking, you know?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen realized she needed to do some thinking, too. This situation with Jon was making her miserable, and there was no solution in sight.</p><p>\u201cYou love him, Maryellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why two people who so obviously care for each other have such a hard time finding happiness.\u201d Rachel released a long slow sigh. \u201cI have to tell you, this is not encouraging to someone like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find a husband,\u201d Maryellen said. Surely a woman as lovely, practical and just plain nice as Rachel would succeed in meeting a man.</p><p>\u201cSure I will,\u201d Rachel agreed, \u201cbut I\u2019d prefer he didn\u2019t come with a police record or an addiction to drugs or booze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s your problem, Rach,\u201d Maryellen teased. \u201cYou\u2019re just too darn picky.\u201d</p><p>Peggy had seen changes in Bob over the last year, but the most dramatic ones had come after Sheriff Davis\u2019s last visit. Her husband didn\u2019t sleep well and was often up roaming the house at all hours of the night. He\u2019d lost interest in his wood shop, too. He used to spend much of the day there, working on a variety of projects, but now many of them were left uncompleted. Lately nothing interested him.</p><p>For the last few weeks, he\u2019d attended his AA meetings on a daily basis: twenty-one meetings in twenty-one days. He hadn\u2019t been to that many in such quick succession since he\u2019d first gotten involved with Alcoholics Anonymous. Bob refused to talk about his feelings and snapped at her when she pried. For now, she decided, it was best to leave him alone. They\u2019d meet Hannah Russell later today; maybe then they\u2019d find the answers they sought.</p><p>After spending a sleepless night herself, Peggy called Corrie McAfee. They met at least once a week, to shop, exchange recipes and talk about gardening. She was the one person Peggy could speak to about this upcoming meeting.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Peggy,\u201d she said when her friend picked up the receiver.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d the other woman said cheerfully. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask a favor?\u201d Peggy\u2019s stomach was in knots, and emotionally she wasn\u2019t in much better shape than Bob.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible for you and Roy to be here this afternoon? We promised Sheriff Davis we\u2019d see this girl, but now I\u2019m not so sure we should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me talk to Roy,\u201d Corrie said, and put her on hold for a moment.</p><p>Peggy gnawed on her lower lip, leaning against the kitchen wall as she waited for Corrie. The meeting with Hannah would be hard on everyone. Peggy didn\u2019t know what they could tell Max Russell\u2019s daughter; she, too, was looking for answers and unfortunately they had none to give her.</p><p>Corrie was back. \u201cRoy\u2019s clearing his schedule now. We\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Peggy mentioned the appointment time, then added. \u201cI...I didn\u2019t discuss this with Bob, but I\u2019ll tell him you\u2019re coming before you and Roy get here.\u201d She felt it was only fair to let her friend know this.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Corrie assured her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Peg, everything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>Peggy wished she could believe that.</p><p>All afternoon, Peggy and Bob were tense and on edge with each other. He did agree to having the McAfees at the meeting, though, which was a relief to Peggy, who wanted them for emotional support.</p><p>By three o\u2019clock when the doorbell rang, Peggy was an emotional wreck and Bob wasn\u2019t any better. Although she\u2019d been a hostess for many years, she fussed about the kitchen with coffee cups and cookies and plates as though she\u2019d never entertained before.</p><p>Roy and Corrie arrived first. Bob shook hands with Roy and then led the couple into the living room. Corrie and Roy sat on one of the two sofas, leaving the two wing chairs by the fireplace vacant.</p><p>Bob waited until they were seated before he said, \u201cPeggy told me she\u2019d asked you to join us. Frankly I appreciate the fact that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to do it,\u201d Roy assured him.</p><p>The doorbell chimed again, and Peggy\u2019s heart instantly flew into her throat. Bob\u2019s eyes met hers and he, too, seemed momentarily paralyzed. He recovered quickly. With a determined stride he went to answer the door.</p><p>The young woman who stepped into the foyer was very tall and thin, and Peggy had a whimsical image of her as one of the great blue herons who stalked the pebble beach of the cove. Sheriff Davis entered the house behind their guest.</p><p>The woman, who appeared to be close in age to her own children, wore a full-length, tan raincoat with navy-blue pants and a sweater. Her dark hair was tied with a scarf at the base of her neck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Hannah,\u201d Bob said as he took her coat. \u201cI wish it was under more pleasant circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d She glanced nervously into the room.</p><p>Roy stood for the introduction, which Peggy thought was a nice touch. He then shook hands with Sheriff Davis. If the sheriff had any questions about the McAfees\u2019 presence, he didn\u2019t voice them.</p><p>Once everyone was settled\u2014Sheriff Davis and Hannah in the chairs by the fireplace\u2014Peggy suggested they talk first and save the coffee and cookies for later.</p><p>\u201cI think that would be best,\u201d Hannah said. Her voice was soft and modulated as she leaned forward and folded her hands on her knees, almost as if she were a schoolgirl. She did look young, and so vulnerable. Peggy resisted the urge to give her shoulders a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>\u201cI hope we can answer your questions,\u201d Bob began.</p><p>\u201cI hope you can, too.\u201d Hannah inhaled loudly, obviously gathering strength.</p><p>\u201cEarlier today I was in to see Sheriff Davis,\u201d Hannah said, nodding at him. \u201cHe gave me my dad\u2019s ashes. I\u2019ll take them back to California and place them in the mausoleum next to my mother.\u201d</p><p>Peggy could only imagine how difficult this must be for someone so young. \u201cI hope now that your father\u2019s been found, you have some closure,\u201d she said. The words sounded hollow and trite to her own ears.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if closure is possible until I discover why Dad came to Cedar Cove in the first place,\u201d Hannah responded. \u201cAs I was telling Sheriff Davis, we don\u2019t know anyone in Washington state. As far as I\u2019m aware, Dad\u2019s never been to this area before...and he was acting so mysterious when he left. He didn\u2019t want me to find out where he was going\u2014that was pretty clear. I wouldn\u2019t even have known he was leaving if I hadn\u2019t stopped in to see him that day. Can you tell me anything?\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could,\u201d Bob answered, \u201cbut Peggy and I are as much at a loss as you.\u201d</p><p>Peggy murmured agreement.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you want to know whatever I can tell you about that night,\u201d Bob said, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Anything would be helpful.\u201d</p><p>Bob proceeded to fill in the details, describing everything he and Peggy had discussed dozens of times, together and with the police.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis said sometimes it\u2019s the minutest detail that leads to an answer,\u201d Peggy added.</p><p>There was a brief silence after this remark.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind answering a few questions I have?\u201d Roy asked Hannah.</p><p>\u201cI will if I can.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis frowned, but he didn\u2019t intrude.</p><p>\u201cI understand your father was injured in a car accident that also killed your mother?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hannah\u2019s face was troubled. \u201cHe never forgave himself for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat caused the accident?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cThe investigation determined that my father was at fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the accident report,\u201d Roy said slowly, \u201cand your father claimed the steering failed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe did say that,\u201d Hannah agreed, \u201cbut the accident investigators couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with the steering system. The only thing they could suggest is the tube leading to the automatic steering system had an air pocket in it. Apparently that sometimes happens, but it\u2019s rare, and without any conclusive evidence, my father was found to be at fault.\u201d She paused and looked at Sheriff Davis. \u201cI think in some ways it might\u2019ve been easier on my dad if he\u2019d died that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guilt?\u201d Troy asked.</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d she said, \u201cand month upon month of surgery and physical therapy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your father\u2019s friends?\u201d Roy asked next.</p><p>Hannah glanced down at her hands. \u201cDad was pretty much a loner. He didn\u2019t have a lot of friends. Oh\u2014there was one old army buddy who helped him get into the VA hospital where he was treated. But other than that...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cMom told me he was a different man before the war. They were just dating back then, and she saved all his letters. Some days after they\u2019d had an argument, she would sit on their bed and read them. She said they reminded her of what Dad was like before the war.</p> <p>\u201cDo you still have those letters?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see them if you do,\u201d Sheriff Davis said before Roy could ask.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019d want them back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Troy Davis assured her.</p><p>\u201cI understand you knew my father.\u201d Hannah\u2019s question was directed at Bob.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe spent a year together in Nam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you tell me what he was like then?\u201d</p><p>Bob leaned back in his chair and took a moment to compose his thoughts. \u201cWhat I remember most about Max is his guitar. At the end of the day, we\u2019d sit around and he\u2019d bring it out and strum a few songs. You can\u2019t imagine how much music can do to take the edge off, especially in the situation your dad and I were in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know my father played the guitar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t after\u2014\u201d Bob stopped abruptly and faltered. \u201cSomething happened in the war that affected both your father and me. War is like that. It can destroy your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never spoke of the war,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Bob didn\u2019t, either. When he\u2019d first returned from Nam, Peggy had thought it would help if her husband talked about his experiences. He\u2019d refused. Had she known what demons hounded him, she would\u2019ve suggested counseling, but he kept many of his experiences hidden from her. It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d just about drowned in a bottle that she understood why, and by then it was almost too late.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like to ask us?\u201d Peggy inquired.</p><p>Hannah shook her head. \u201cI appreciate that you let me come. I wondered, you know. Anyone would. He\u2019s gone...both he and my mom. I just wondered....\u201d</p> <p>Like Hannah, Peggy wondered if she and Bob would ever find peace.</p><p>Rosie tried not to dwell on Zach\u2019s confession that he\u2019d relied emotionally on his personal assistant. In essence, Zach had admitted to falling in love with the other woman. She\u2019d known in her heart that he\u2019d been unfaithful, and he\u2019d proved her at least partially right. Rosie could only speculate about what had happened, but\u2014as he\u2019d admitted\u2014eventually Zach would have become Janice\u2019s lover.</p><p>Their divorce had been final for months, and by now she should be ready to move on. Instead, she felt as if she was falling deeper and deeper into an abyss, a place of uncertainty and sadness.</p><p>Sunday afternoon she waited until she was sure Zach would be out of the house before she arrived. Her entrance didn\u2019t cause much of a stir. Eddie was reading one of the Harry Potter books and Allison was in her bedroom with the door closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d Eddie asked, glancing up when she came in, carrying two plastic grocery bags.</p><p>\u201cHow about spaghetti?\u201d she asked, knowing it was her son\u2019s favorite.</p><p>\u201cWe had that last night, and I like Dad\u2019s spaghetti sauce better than yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much,\u201d she muttered under her breath. Her son was nothing if not honest.</p><p>When Rosie walked into the kitchen, she set the groceries on the counter and stared around her in complete awe. The room was meticulously clean. The floor had been washed and waxed to such a bright sheen she could see her own reflection. Not only that, the countertops were cleared off and wiped down. The stove had a shine to it that had been sadly absent since the day they\u2019d moved into the house. Rosie walked over to the wall-mounted oven and opened it. Sure enough, that, too, was spotless.</p><p>\u201cWho cleaned the kitchen?\u201d Rosie called out to her son.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>It hurt like hell to admit that her ex-husband was a better housekeeper and cook than she\u2019d ever been. Rosie tried not to feel sorry for herself. She should be counting her blessings instead of complaining. The kitchen was immaculate. She\u2019d wanted to clean it for weeks, but even in her heyday as a wife and mother, she\u2019d never have managed anything close to the perfection that lay before her now.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Allison said, wandering into the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator and took out a can of soda.</p><p>Even without looking, Rosie knew it had been cleaned, too.</p><p>\u201cSloppy joes okay with you for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>Such enthusiasm. \u201cDo you think Dad\u2019s a better cook than I am?\u201d Rosie wasn\u2019t sure why she bothered to ask. Her daughter was bound to heap salt onto her already bleeding wounds.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to be honest?\u201d Allison said, pulling the tab on the soda can.</p><p>That, on its own, was answer enough. Rosie crossed her arms and mentally prepared herself for the answer. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Allison took a deep swallow of her soda. \u201cAt first Dad cooked the same things you did, but then he really seemed to get into it. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of time, you know, so he does fun things like chicken salad with grapes and pineapple and lettuce. I sometimes help him,\u201d she added proudly. \u201cWe use bottled sauce\u2014the gourmet stuff. It\u2019s really yummy. I\u2019ll give you the recipe if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis spaghetti\u2019s really good, too. He adds sliced olives, and last night he threw in a can of jalape\u00f1os. It was great. Dad said that\u2019s called fusion cooking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFusion. Come on, Mom, get with it.\u201d</p><p>For reasons she didn\u2019t want to examine too closely, tears filled Rosie\u2019s eyes and spilled down her cheeks. She tried to hide them from her daughter but should have known better.</p><p>\u201cMom, are you crying?\u201d</p><p>Rosie shrugged and turned her back to Allison.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014I\u2019m just so glad to have you back.\u201d She turned around and hugged her daughter. The girl was taller than Rosie\u2014when had that happened?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d Allison protested.</p><p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d Rosie said, and cupped her daughter\u2019s beautiful face. \u201cI thought I\u2019d lost you. I\u2019m so grateful you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>Allison rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to cry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d It didn\u2019t escape Rosie\u2019s notice that she wasn\u2019t the one her daughter had reached out to. Instead, a woman who was virtually a stranger had stepped into the role of mentor. Rosie could now add another failing to her list: besides being a bad wife and an inadequate housekeeper, she was a terrible mother.</p><p>It was suddenly too much for her, and pulling out a chair, Rosie buried her face in her hands.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cFine...sorry, just give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Allison insisted.</p><p>How could she? Rosie kept her face covered and continued to cry into her hands. She could hear Allison and Eddie whispering in the background, but she was too upset to pay attention.</p><p>After about ten minutes, she stood, unloaded her grocery bags and set a pan on the stove top. She wasn\u2019t hungry, but in all likelihood the children were. She was enough of a failure without adding that to her list of sins.</p><p>The front door opened, and Rosie quickly wiped her cheeks and reached for a tissue to blow her nose. When she looked up, she discovered Zach standing in the kitchen doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Allison and Eddie crowded around their father. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad, Mom. We called Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that?\u201d she demanded, knowing she sounded defensive. At this point she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Allison took a step forward. \u201cBecause you wouldn\u2019t stop crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2014\u201d</p><p>Zach\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cI\u2019m right here, Rosie. There\u2019s no need to talk about me as if I wasn\u2019t in the room.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hands on her hips and glared at him. \u201cThis is my time with the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever. I\u2019ll just turn around and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was Eddie who spoke first.</p><p>Allison echoed him. \u201cNo. Dad, Mom needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Rosie muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou do, Mom,\u201d Allison said. \u201cNow, talk, both of you, and Eddie and I\u2019ll cook dinner.\u201d</p><p>Eddie seemed ready to protest, but at a glance from his sister, he closed his mouth.</p><p>Rosie and Zach frowned at each other for a moment before Zach gestured toward the family room. \u201cIt looks like we have our orders.\u201d</p><p>Rosie grabbed a second tissue and reluctantly followed her ex-husband.</p><p>They sat as far apart from each other as possible. Rosie took one end of the sofa and Zach sat on the edge of the recliner. Neither said anything for several tense minutes.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to explain about my comment the other day,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>Rosie wasn\u2019t up to hearing another confession. She raised her hand, stopping him. \u201cPlease don\u2019t. Frankly, I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Zach ignored her request. \u201cI felt it was only fair to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d she said, losing patience.</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, so you can drag my self-esteem through the gutter again? Fine, you had an emotional affair. I heard you the first time. I got the message.\u201d</p><p>Zach hung his head. \u201cBut I was never physically involved with Janice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. You were in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he corrected quickly. \u201cI had an emotional relationship with her, and there\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>Rosie wasn\u2019t sure that was true. All she knew was that her husband, the man she loved, had wanted another woman. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I look back on everything that led up to the divorce,\u201d Zach continued, \u201cI understand how you must have felt. Instead of answering your concerns, I saw you as a jealous shrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Rosie admitted softly. She closed her eyes in shame as she remembered the things she\u2019d said, the way she\u2019d behaved toward her husband.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rosie. I couldn\u2019t regret what happened any more than I already do. I hurt you, I hurt our children and in the process I hurt myself.\u201d</p><p>She sniffled loudly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too, but that isn\u2019t the only reason I\u2019m crying. Oh, Zach,\u201d she wailed, \u201cthe kitchen is so beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou noticed,\u201d he said, and there was a note of satisfaction in his voice. \u201cI wanted to do something for you and that was the only thing I could think of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a better housekeeper than I\u2019ll ever be,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>\u201cHey, we each have our strengths and weaknesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a better cook.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, teasing her with a sexy grin. \u201cI disagree with you there.\u201d</p> <p>Rosie blew her nose. \u201cThe kids don\u2019t think so. Eddie said your spaghetti sauce is better than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou use the stuff in jars. I make it fresh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Zach conceded, \u201cI make better spaghetti than you do, but no one bakes an orange cake as good as yours.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a hopeless look. \u201cThe recipe\u2019s from a boxed cake mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think anyone cares so long as it tastes good?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at her again and this time Rosie smiled shyly back.</p><p>Allison and Eddie marched into the room.</p><p>\u201cFeel better, Mom?\u201d Her teenage daughter was far too pleased with herself.</p><p>Rosie nodded. \u201cMuch better, thank you both.\u201d She glanced over at Zach. \u201cThank you, too.\u201d</p><p>Her ex-husband stood up, obviously ready to leave.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Eddie said in a stage whisper. \u201cAsk her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her what?\u201d Zach whispered back.</p><p>\u201cOn a date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rosie stared at her son.</p><p>\u201cI think Dad should ask you on a date,\u201d Eddie explained.</p><p>Zach frowned, not meeting Rosie\u2019s eyes. \u201cYour mother\u2019s going out with that widower now.\u201d</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cNo, she isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t?\u201d Zach turned to Rosie.</p><p>\u201cNo. We only went out once and it was...not a success. Neither of us is ready for another relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Zach smiled. \u201cAre you game for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d Allison groaned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be more romantic than that. Ask Mom again and this time do it right.\u201d</p><p>With a mock-serious expression, Zach bowed. \u201cRosie, would you do me the honor of having dinner with me on Thursday evening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t,\u201d Eddie answered. \u201cThat\u2019s Scouting night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Zach muttered.</p><p>\u201cTake Mom out tonight,\u201d Allison urged. \u201cI\u2019ll cook dinner for me and Eddie. You two talk. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Rosie looked at Zach and he looked at her. A slow grin came over his face as he extended his hand. With barely a pause, she placed her own hand in his.</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>Grace sat with her morning cup of coffee. It was early Saturday, and the kitchen light caused shadows to flicker across the wall, heightening the impression of a dark and gloomy day. More than three weeks had gone by since she\u2019d taken Buttercup to the vet. More than three weeks since she\u2019d seen Cliff.</p><p>The dog was only now beginning to recover from cancer. Fortunately, all the tumors had been successfully removed. For a while, her prognosis had been poor and Grace had worried endlessly that she would lose her faithful companion. If Buttercup had died, Grace would\u2019ve been to blame, and she would have had a hard time forgiving herself. Cliff had warned her that Buttercup didn\u2019t look well; she\u2019d ignored him, just as she\u2019d ignored everything else these last few months during her obsession with Will.</p><p>In retrospect, Grace saw how easily she\u2019d fallen into this. It made her ill to think how low she\u2019d sunk in her Internet relationship with Will Jefferson. She berated herself for being swayed by his compliments and his admiration. In truth, though, it hadn\u2019t been as one-sided as that. She knew he\u2019d derived comfort and gratification from Grace\u2019s feelings for him; his marriage was in trouble\u2014that much she believed\u2014and he\u2019d used her to salvage his ego, to bask in another woman\u2019s adoration. Caught in this web of mutual fascination, Grace had ignored one very important fact: Will Jefferson was a married man.</p><p>Her face burned with humiliation. Will had purchased her plane ticket to New Orleans, and she knew very well that he\u2019d only booked one hotel room. She also knew what would\u2019ve happened when she joined him.</p><p>Adding to her humiliation was the memory of how angry she\u2019d been with Stan, Olivia\u2019s ex-husband, when they\u2019d learned that he\u2019d moved in with Marge. The divorce wasn\u2019t even final and already he was sleeping with another woman, involved in an affair. Grace realized now that she was no better than Stan. No better than the men she\u2019d reviled for being unfaithful.</p><p>Cliff had guessed what she\u2019d been doing and had ended their relationship. She\u2019d been such a fool. No one had ever treated her better or showed her as much love and consideration as Cliff Harding.</p><p>Maybe her problem was that Cliff was simply too good. Something inside her rejected his genuine warmth and love. Was it because she felt unworthy? All Grace knew was that she\u2019d done the very thing she\u2019d promised Cliff\u2019s daughter she\u2019d never do, and that was hurt Cliff.</p><p>She prayed it wasn\u2019t too late. She spent at least an hour gathering her courage to visit Cliff. She\u2019d considered phoning ahead, then decided against it. If he wasn\u2019t at the ranch house, she\u2019d just return another time.</p><p>She had to face him, had to confess. She wanted Cliff to understand how sincerely sorry she was. Although she didn\u2019t deserve his forgiveness, she needed it.</p><p>Grace dressed carefully. She chose a jeans jumper and blouse Cliff especially liked. As she got ready to leave the house, Buttercup lifted her head from her pillowed dog bed and watched her every move. Maybe it was a fanciful thought, but she felt as if her golden retriever knew Grace was going to see Cliff. Knew and approved. While friendly, Buttercup was a discerning dog and wasn\u2019t prone to accepting strangers, but she\u2019d loved Cliff from the very first.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be sure to tell Cliff you\u2019re feeling better,\u201d she said, bending over to stroke her dog\u2019s silky ears. She\u2019d given Buttercup lots of attention during the last few weeks, pampering her in an effort to make up for the neglect.</p><p>By the time she walked outside, it\u2019d started to drizzle. Typical March weather. The windshield wipers made lazy swishes as Grace drove the twenty minutes to Olalla and Cliff\u2019s ranch.</p><p>Although Grace had often visited his ranch, she hadn\u2019t been there in at least six months. Turning into his long driveway she was immediately surprised by the number of apparent changes. A dozen horses grazed in the pasture, far more than she recalled from her last visit. A freshly painted white fence bordered the drive; it made for a striking entrance to the ranch. A large two-story red barn had replaced the smaller one.</p><p>When she pulled into the yard and parked near the barn, a man she didn\u2019t recognize walked out. Raising the hood of her raincoat, she left her car.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m Grace Sherman. Is Cliff available?\u201d</p><p>The dark-haired man hesitated, then nodded. \u201cC-Cal Washburn,\u201d he said with a slight stutter. He was attractive\u2014solid and squarely built, with an aura of competence. He appeared to be in his mid-thirties, but it was always difficult for Grace to judge age. His eyes, an intense shade of blue, seemed to look straight through her. It made Grace wonder if Cliff had mentioned her name\u2014and whether or not Cal was going to answer her question.</p><p>The front door opened and Cliff stepped out.</p><p>\u201cCliff!\u201d Grace hurried across the yard. Cliff moved aside and held the door for her.</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind my coming by like this,\u201d she said. The warmth in the house enveloped her.</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t mind.\u201d Cliff took her coat from her shoulders and hung it in the foyer.</p><p>Grace rubbed her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s colder than I expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I get us a cup of coffee,\u201d Cliff suggested.</p><p>This was going well and Grace began to relax. She followed him into the kitchen, noting improvements in the house as well as the yard.</p><p>\u201cHow long has Cal been around?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCouple months now,\u201d Cliff said as he stood in front of the cupboard and selected two mugs. He seemed pleased to see her, cordial and polite, but...reserved. She had the impression that her visit had prompted mixed feelings. Which was only natural under the circumstances, she acknowledged.</p><p>Cliff poured them each a cup and set hers on the kitchen counter. Grace slipped onto a stool, while he stood across from her, on the other side of the counter.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Buttercup?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMuch better. I was terrified when they discovered the tumors. For a while, I thought I might lose her.\u201d</p><p>Cliff nodded. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear she\u2019s on the mend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>The silence that followed was uncomfortable. Cliff didn\u2019t make any effort to fill it, so Grace forged ahead. \u201cI know my visit must be something of a surprise,\u201d she said. She gestured around. \u201cYou\u2019ve done a lot of work since I was last here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured. But he offered no further comment.</p><p>Grace stared down at her coffee, wishing she\u2019d thought about what she wanted to say. She stared out the window at the expansive structure. \u201cWhen did you build the barn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contractor started construction the beginning of December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you intended to make such major improvements to the property.\u201d</p><p>Now it was Cliff who stared down at his coffee. \u201cI mentioned a new barn a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. That\u2019s right, you did.\u201d Of course he\u2019d talked about it. She had a vague recollection of it. Anytime they were together she\u2019d been preoccupied, wondering when she could get back home and onto the computer. Grace could only guess how much else she\u2019d missed.</p><p>\u201cI mentioned hiring Cal, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do remember that.\u201d What she recalled was Cliff\u2019s saying he might hire a full-time trainer. She\u2019d obviously been mentally absent during subsequent conversations.</p><p>He glanced at his watch\u2014an unmistakable signal that her time was almost up.</p><p>\u201cI came because I wanted to apologize, Cliff,\u201d she said quickly. This was difficult. Painful. Embarrassing. But she had to do it. \u201cYou were right\u2014I was involved with someone else.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cMarried?\u201d</p><p>Her face was flushed as she nodded. \u201cHe lives out of state\u2014we only spoke online.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cliff sipped his coffee and didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cIt\u2019s over. Thank God I came to my senses before...before anything happened.\u201d She didn\u2019t mention how close it had been. Or that it was only by chance she\u2019d learned the truth about Will. If it hadn\u2019t been for Olivia, Grace would have sunk deeper and deeper until she\u2019d been completely swallowed up in the deception. She blinked back tears as she thought about the people she\u2019d deceived\u2014Cliff, first of all, and Georgia. Olivia. Her own daughters. Herself...</p><p>\u201cI misled you,\u201d Grace murmured, struggling with remorse. \u201cYou\u2019ve been nothing but kind, and I abused that. Oh, Cliff, can you ever forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can,\u201d he said without emotion. After a moment, he added, \u201cBut, unfortunately, I can\u2019t undo the past.\u201d</p> <p>Grace didn\u2019t understand what he was telling her. \u201cI realize that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he asked, looking doubtful. He set his coffee mug in the sink, standing there for a moment with his back to her.</p><p>\u201cExplain it to me.\u201d</p><p>Cliff turned to face her. \u201cI think I told you this before. I know what it\u2019s like to be betrayed. I recognized the signs.\u201d</p><p>She hung her head, aware she\u2019d hurt him badly. With everything in her, she wanted to erase the pain she\u2019d caused him.</p> <p>\u201cSusan had quite a few affairs over the years,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was a sickness with her, I think. At first I wondered if there was something missing in me, something I wasn\u2019t giving her. She was constantly seeking admiration and approval from men. The only way she seemed capable of getting what she needed was through these affairs. Yet she repeatedly told me how much she loved me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, and it was the saddest smile Grace had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cThe irony is that I believe Susan did love me. For most of our marriage I looked the other way and tried to pretend her indiscretions didn\u2019t matter, but I was wrong. They mattered a lot. I held on to the marriage for Lisa\u2019s sake. Then before I knew it, my daughter was grown-up, and all at once I realized I was trapped in a relationship that was nothing more than a pretence.\u201d</p><p>Grace knew how painful it was for Cliff to discuss the details of his marriage. She also knew what that felt like. Her own marriage had been difficult. For years she\u2019d believed it was something lacking in her that had brought on Dan\u2019s dark moods. Only after his death did she learn she wasn\u2019t to blame, although she\u2019d accepted responsibility for Dan\u2019s unhappiness. Cliff\u2019s situation had been quite different, but Grace identified with his emotions.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping the two of us could start over again,\u201d she said, forcing herself to meet his eyes. She so badly wanted to put this behind them and pick up where they\u2019d left off.</p><p>He stared at her for the longest moment of her life and then reluctantly looked away. In that movement she read his answer.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Cliff said in a voice so low Grace had to strain to hear him.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d She wanted to argue, but even before she could get the words out she knew it would do no good. His mind was made up and nothing she said or did now would change that.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go back, Grace. I lived that life once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t\u2014I was faithful to Dan for thirty-four years. I\u2019m not anything like Susan.\u201d</p><p>Cliff crossed his arms. He was shutting her out, she thought. He\u2019d rather be anyplace except with her. Still, she held her ground, unwilling to give up on them so easily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re like Susan,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m simply saying I can\u2019t deal with the feelings I associate with her. The last time I saw you, it was as though every doubt, every negative emotion from my marriage, came flying at me. I don\u2019t want to live like that. I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to deal with those emotions anymore.\u201d Lowering his head, he murmured, \u201cFor a while I believed we had something special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d she said. And she\u2019d ruined it.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he agreed quietly, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel that way now.\u201d His expression was full of regret. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be a good idea for us to see each other again. I\u2019m sorry, Grace.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart felt as though it had leaped to her throat and was pounding its way out. Rather than risk speaking and having her voice crack, Grace nodded. She finished her coffee, then slipped off the kitchen stool.</p><p>\u201cI guess this is goodbye.\u201d That was all she could manage.</p><p>Cliff nodded.</p><p>With only pride holding her together, Grace left the kitchen.</p><p>Cliff accompanied her into the foyer and retrieved her coat. He held it for her and she blindly shoved her arms into the sleeves.</p><p>Then he placed his hands on her shoulders, gently turning her in his arms. As if he couldn\u2019t stop himself, he kissed her. A final kiss. His mouth was moist and warm as it covered hers.</p><p>Grace came into his embrace, wrapping her arms around him as she gave herself to the kiss. She sensed his hunger, his desire\u2014and his regret. All too soon, long before she was ready, he pulled away.</p><p>He refused to meet her eyes. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d he said, and opened the door for her.</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>\u201cAre your eyes closed?\u201d Olivia asked, peeking around the sliding glass door that led to the deck of Jack\u2019s rental house. Sitting in his hot tub, in plain view of the entire world, was an uncomfortable prospect for Olivia. Jack, however, had refused to take no for an answer.</p><p>A misty fog surrounded the hot tub where he sat impatiently waiting for her. It was a cloudy evening, the second Sunday in March. \u201cMy eyes are closed,\u201d he assured her, grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>Even from this distance, she could tell he was lying. \u201cJack Griffin, your eyes are wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I\u2019ve seen a woman in a bathing suit before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t seen me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019m dying to, so hurry up.\u201d</p><p>The patio light was far too bright, she decided. Grumbling under her breath, she tucked the towel more tightly around her and stepped barefoot onto the deck. Although it faced the cove and not the road, Olivia was sure the entire neighborhood would be catching a glimpse of her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even remember the last time she\u2019d donned a swimsuit. This very one, in fact. Years and years ago. James had still been living at home. Justine, too. Her swimsuit was sadly outdated, but luckily it wasn\u2019t the kind of material that attracted moths.</p><p>\u201cSooner or later you\u2019re going to have to drop that towel,\u201d Jack told her as she took her first tentative steps outside. He leaned back in a relaxed pose, arms spread out across the back of the tub.</p><p>\u201cIf I see a picture of myself in The Chronicle, I swear I\u2019ll never forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, you\u2019re giving me ideas.\u201d Jack chuckled as if an embarrassing photograph was indeed a possibility.</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Reluctantly she lowered the towel. Feeling as graceful as a walrus, she climbed over the edge of the hot tub and slid into the water. It was warm, soothing and refreshing at the same time. \u201cAh,\u201d she sighed involuntarily.</p><p>\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t so bad, now was it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Olivia moved next to him, sinking shoulder-deep into the bubbling water. Rather than respond, she sighed again, a sigh of pure contentment. She was oh, so glad Jack had urged her to set aside her inhibitions and join him.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019ve got a very attractive body,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you insist on hiding it.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shook her head. \u201cDo you know how old I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014and what\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty. I\u2019ve had children, Jack, and my body is far from perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, if I wanted to date a twenty-year-old model\u2014\u201d He gave a quick laugh. \u201cHell, a twenty-year-old model wouldn\u2019t be seen dead with an old fart like me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled, too. \u201cWe make a good couple, don\u2019t we?\u201d She rested her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack agreed. \u201cWe do, Judge O. Especially when we\u2019re practically naked in a hot tub together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d She giggled. She was enjoying herself but refused to give him credit; if she did, she\u2019d never hear the end of it.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said, \u201ctell me I was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind gloating silently?\u201d she muttered, letting her eyes drift shut.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Grace doing?\u201d Jack suddenly asked.</p><p>Olivia groaned. She\u2019d been deeply concerned for her friend. \u201cBetter, I think.\u201d Grace had come to Olivia last Saturday afternoon, as upset as Olivia had ever seen her. Despite several attempts, Olivia wasn\u2019t able to pry the entire story out of her, but apparently Grace had done something to offend Cliff and he\u2019d decided it would be best if they no longer saw each other.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to her recently?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cI saw her Wednesday night. Why?\u201d</p><p>Jack rested his chin on top of Olivia\u2019s head. \u201cI think she might be volunteering for the Humane Society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, she did say something about that.\u201d Olivia approved; Grace seemed to have a lot of time on her hands all at once. She\u2019d always been fond of animals. Buttercup had brought her comfort and companionship when Grace had most needed it. This volunteer position was something she could do to help animals, and perhaps a human or two. Olivia also suspected that Grace saw it as a way of making up for not getting Buttercup to the vet more quickly, not noticing the symptoms sooner. She tried to reassure her friend, but Grace persisted in blaming herself, which Olivia thought unreasonable.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know about Grace volunteering?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe way I know about everything. The paper\u2019s doing an article about the shelter. When I showed up to talk to the director, Grace was there filling out the paperwork. The shelter does a background check before they accept any volunteers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019ll be good for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Olivia opened her eyes and gazed up at the sky. The clouds had parted and the stars were coming out; it was turning into a spectacular night. Most of her friends were at a fund-raising dinner she\u2019d gladly skipped. She could only imagine what her co-workers would say if they could see the very prim and proper Judge Lockhart soaking in a hot tub. And with a man, yet.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do this for anyone else, you know,\u201d she told him. She didn\u2019t need to elaborate on what she meant; Jack knew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it.\u201d He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>Olivia felt his chest expand and then softly he said, \u201cI love you, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d admitted his feelings, but something about the way he\u2019d said it felt different. She leaned away from him and looked into his eyes. \u201cI love you, too, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean that, Olivia? Really mean it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>A sigh rumbled inside his chest. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like to talk about Stan, and frankly, I don\u2019t blame you, but I think we should. For the last time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right.\u201d This sounded ominous.</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t speak for a moment, and she gave him a nudge with her elbow. \u201cYour ex-husband made it plain from the day we met that he wanted you back.\u201d</p><p>Olivia kissed Jack\u2019s chin. \u201cI know, but he can\u2019t have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a whole lot more to offer you than I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>Jack chuckled. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want me to get into that, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she challenged. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t seem to understand is that my ex-husband doesn\u2019t hold a candle to you in a hundred different ways. Okay, he probably brings home a bigger paycheck.\u201d</p><p>Jack snorted. \u201cProbably? No one gets rich in the newspaper business, at least not these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting money\u2019s important to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why worry about it?\u201d</p><p>Again she felt Jack expel a deep sigh. \u201cBecause I\u2019m attempting to be noble here and you\u2019re making it damn hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoble?\u201d Olivia wasn\u2019t sure she liked the sound of this.</p><p>\u201cAll right, if you must know, I\u2019m asking you to put me out of my misery and marry me.\u201d</p><p>For a wild moment Olivia was too stunned to react. \u201cJack, are you proposing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. I want us to be together, Olivia. I love you. The way things stand now, all we get are the leftovers of each other\u2019s lives\u2014and I want more. I want you to be in my life and I want to be in yours.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI want to be there when you wake up in the morning and at your side when you get into bed at night, and all the in-between times, too.\u201d</p><p>This was romantic, and romance was the last thing she expected from Jack Griffin.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it any plainer than that,\u201d he concluded.</p><p>\u201cThen what was all this business about Stan?\u201d If he told her he\u2019d willingly step aside for her ex-husband, she was going to shove his head underwater, dammit!</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I was going to tell you\u2014\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t let Stan have you. I thought I could do it, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, the hell with him.\u201d</p><p>Olivia leaned back and rewarded him with a long, breath-stealing kiss followed by a series of short kisses down the side of his neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you. Go on,\u201d she urged.</p><p>Jack\u2019s arms tightened around her. \u201cI\u2019m never letting you go again, Olivia. I\u2019m only half alive without you.\u201d</p><p>She felt a burst of happiness, and her body seemed so light, so buoyant, she thought she could soar straight up to the stars.</p><p>Jack took her by the shoulders and turned her sideways so he could look her full in the face. \u201cWill you marry me, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>She blinked back tears and nodded. \u201cOh, yes, Jack.\u201d Then she was in his arms again and he was kissing her with an abandon that sent the blood surging through her veins. This was the beginning for them, a beginning that would last the rest of their lives.</p><p>A small piece of information had been niggling at the back of Roy McAfee\u2019s mind ever since he\u2019d met Hannah Russell. It took him ten days to figure out what it was. Patience almost always paid off; the facts hidden in his memory usually emerged if he gave them time. But now he\u2019d glimpsed the elusive detail and he needed to talk to someone.</p><p>Consequently, he showed up at the sheriff\u2019s office first thing Monday morning. Davis was sitting at his desk and seemed unsurprised when Roy walked into his office.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up and about pretty early,\u201d Davis said, looking up from the paperwork spread across his desk. \u201cAnything I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d</p><p>Davis gestured toward the empty seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been giving some thought to our meeting with Russell\u2019s daughter,\u201d Roy said as he sat down.</p><p>The sheriff steepled his fingers. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t still have a list of Russell\u2019s personal effects, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Mind my asking what you want it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to look at it again,\u201d Roy told him.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d Roy flipped open a file folder that lay on the edge of his credenza, then left the office for a moment. Roy could hear the hum of the copy machine.</p><p>Davis returned, handed him the sheet and sat down again. He reviewed the list along with Roy. \u201cThere were his clothes,\u201d Roy read aloud. \u201cNothing unusual there. A good suit, a long dark raincoat and a wide-brimmed hat.\u201d</p><p>Davis nodded as he glanced over the items. \u201cHis daughter said he\u2019d taken to wearing the hat after the accident.\u201d</p><p>Roy lifted his head. Thus far, everything seemed as it should. \u201cAnything else catch your attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis briefcase, of course.\u201d</p><p>Roy would\u2019ve liked the opportunity to search that himself before it\u2019d been released to Hannah.</p><p>As if reading his thoughts, Davis said, \u201cNothing there. I checked it myself. No secret compartments or anything to indicate it had been tampered with in any way.\u201d</p><p>Of course not. That would\u2019ve been too easy, Roy thought. \u201cWhat about the contents?\u201d</p><p>Davis smiled, but it wasn\u2019t a smile that conveyed amusement. \u201cHe had a crossword puzzle book, a mystery novel and a map of the area, plus a couple of candy bars. For someone who\u2019d traveled this far, he packed pretty light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about his suitcase?\u201d</p><p>Davis frowned. \u201cTwo changes of clothes, as you can see on this list. We turned that bag inside out looking for something that would give us a clue about who he was. I\u2019m telling you right now, there wasn\u2019t a damn thing out of the ordinary.\u201d</p><p>Roy believed him.</p><p>Davis hesitated. \u201cIt seems to me you\u2019ve studied that list a couple of times in the last few months. Why all the interest now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about your feeling and I\u2019ll tell you about mine.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded; that was fair. \u201cDo you remember, when Russell\u2019s daughter was at the Beldons\u2019, she mentioned the automobile accident that killed her mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said her father claimed something had gone wrong with the steering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to the report, the accident investigator found nothing,\u201d Davis reminded him.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Roy agreed, but they both knew there were ways to disguise the true cause of an accident. In addition, there\u2019d been a fire, the same fire that had badly burned Russell\u2019s face and hands. The blaze could easily have destroyed any evidence of foul play.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Davis asked.</p><p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t know what killed Russell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know his heart stopped beating. What we don\u2019t know is why. But then, as the medical examiner said, the guy was in his late fifties, had been to war and back, and survived one hell of a car accident. Maybe it was just his time. He went peacefully, the doc said.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded, but he wasn\u2019t buying any of it. \u201cAs I recall, there was something else in Russell\u2019s personal effects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Davis asked, looking back at the list. Another smile slipped into place as he slowly straightened and leaned toward his desk. \u201cA half-full bottle of flavored water,\u201d he said, answering his own question.</p><p>\u201cDid Russell\u2019s daughter happen to take that with her?\u201d</p><p>Davis shook his head. \u201cShe read it on the list, said it wasn\u2019t unusual for her father to drink bottled water.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t offer to give it to her\u2014don\u2019t have it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Roy could feel his heart start to pound. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you tossed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Davis was grinning now. \u201cI sent it off to the toxicology lab.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met and they nodded at each other in unspoken agreement. \u201cMy guess is, this death wasn\u2019t as natural as some would like to believe,\u201d Davis said.</p><p>\u201cWhy was he killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy travel with fake identification? Why come to Cedar Cove in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to see Beldon,\u201d Roy said. He was confident of that much.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t. Or maybe that wasn\u2019t the only reason he showed up in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat other reason could there be?\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis leaned back in his chair with a self-satisfied look. \u201cMaybe he came to find out what happened to Dan Sherman.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a baby-sitter,\u201d Eddie insisted, defiantly crossing his arms. He glared at Allison, his eyes narrowed, as he silently challenged her to say otherwise.</p><p>\u201cDo, too,\u201d Allison retorted. Zach\u2019s daughter had never been able to walk away from a dare, especially one issued by her little brother.</p><p>\u201cI think we should leave now,\u201d Zach whispered to Rosie under his breath, \u201cbefore the kids give us an excuse to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell her,\u201d Eddie demanded, pleading with his father.</p><p>Zach sympathized with the boy, but there were limitations to what he could say and do. \u201cBaby-sitters get paid, and your sister isn\u2019t getting anything to stay home with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean I\u2019m doing this for nothing?\u201d Allison cried, but the outrage was all for show and Zach knew it.</p><p>Eddie was only partially mollified, but he didn\u2019t protest again when Zach led Rosie out the front door. \u201cThe kids\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Rosie agreed. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying to see this movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Zach said as he hurried ahead to open the car door for her.</p><p>To his astonishment, she stared at the door and didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, slightly annoyed. Granted, it was an old-fashioned courtesy, but Rosie had never objected to it before.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s just that it\u2019s been a long time since you opened the car door for me.\u201d</p><p>Zach felt a little shocked. He knew she was talking about the last year of their marriage, and he supposed she was right. They\u2019d treated each other without considerateness or respect, and the disappearance of small courtesies was a symptom of that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nice touch, Zach, it always was. Thank you.\u201d She slipped into the car and reached for her seat belt.</p><p>Zach hurried around the front of the vehicle. This was their third \u201cdate.\u201d Their first had been dinner the night Rosie had wept and the children had called him. He still didn\u2019t understand what that had been all about, but she seemed to feel better after they\u2019d talked. Even now, almost two weeks later, he didn\u2019t remember exactly what they\u2019d discussed that evening; what he remembered was how comfortable it felt to spend time with Rosie again.</p><p>In the mess they\u2019d made of their lives, Zach had forgotten one important fact. Rosie had been more than his wife\u2014she\u2019d been his friend. He\u2019d missed the little confidences they\u2019d once shared, the small private jokes, the conversations in bed late at night. He hadn\u2019t allowed himself to think about those things until recently, and he realized how much he missed her. How much he missed the way they used to be... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This week the kids were on spring break and Rosie had five free days. They\u2019d already met for lunch on Monday afternoon. On the spur of the moment, they\u2019d decided to take in a show on \u201cTightwad Tuesday,\u201d when all movies were three dollars. Popcorn and soda, however, stayed the same price. Rosie was the one who enjoyed popcorn, especially the buttered variety.</p><p>The movie, a romantic comedy, had been given rave reviews. While Zach paid for their tickets, Rosie stood in line for popcorn. This was a rare night out for Zach during tax season; most evenings he was in the office until seven or eight.</p><p>They chose seats in the back of the theater and toward the middle. He noticed several people glancing in their direction and a few heads moving together in hushed whispers.</p><p>\u201cPeople are talking about us,\u201d Rosie said.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we are divorced,\u201d Zach reminded her with a grin. \u201cDivorced people generally don\u2019t go out on dates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said. \u201cSad commentary, isn\u2019t it? We get along better now that we\u2019re divorced than while we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Zach couldn\u2019t deny it. \u201cAt least during the last few years of our marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did that happen, do you think?\u201d</p><p>Zach was saved from having to answer because the lights dimmed and music blared from the sound system. Soon the previews began, about fifteen minutes\u2019 worth, with lots of noise and frantic action.</p> <p>The movie itself was delightful. More than once, Zach laughed out loud. Although he claimed he wasn\u2019t interested in popcorn, he ate more than half of Rosie\u2019s small bag, which she willingly shared. About halfway through the show, Zach realized they were holding hands, just like they had while they\u2019d dated during college.</p><p>When the lights came back on, they remained seated for a few minutes, enjoying the lingering effects of the movie and the music. People started to leave the theater; several nodded at Zach and Rosie. She was right\u2014they\u2019d caused something of a stir. Well, good. Let people talk all they wanted. He didn\u2019t object.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been ages since I laughed that hard,\u201d Rosie said, standing.</p><p>\u201cMe, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd even longer since we laughed together.\u201d</p><p>Zach could only agree.</p> <p>Because he was so busy at the office and because it was spring break and the kids were home, they\u2019d decided it would be best if Rosie stayed at the house the entire week. Zach drove her back there.</p><p>As he headed toward Pelican Court, they chatted about the movie, laughing again at the antics of the characters and the cleverness of the plot. All too soon, he\u2019d reached the house. Zach wasn\u2019t ready for the evening to end, but he didn\u2019t know if Rosie felt the same.</p><p>When he pulled into the driveway, they sat silently in the car, as if each was waiting for the other to speak first.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s still early,\u201d Rosie said. She glanced tentatively in his direction.</p><p>It was after ten, and Zach had been in the office since before six. Yet he didn\u2019t feel tired at all.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to come in?\u201d she asked in a neutral voice, implying that it didn\u2019t matter to her one way or the other.</p><p>Zach checked his watch, although he already knew the precise time from the digital clock on the car\u2019s dashboard. \u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids will probably still be up,\u201d Rosie told him when he came around and opened the door for her. \u201cAllison stays up till all hours of the night whenever she gets the chance.\u201d</p> <p>Zach knew that and struggled with it, too. He and Allison had discussed this volatile subject on a number of occasions. His final conclusion was that if his daughter got too tired, she\u2019d learn to adjust. He was saving his big guns for when she started driving.</p><p>Zach unlocked the front door and Rosie entered the foyer ahead of him. Two steps into the house, she stopped abruptly. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Zach moved around her to find rose petals strewn about. The red petals seemed to take a path away from the door, down the hallway that led to the master bedroom. Talk about blatant manipulation! His children had set up a romantic interlude for him and Rosie. This, no doubt, was primarily Allison\u2019s doing, since Eddie, as a nine-year-old boy, didn\u2019t have much of a clue about love and romance.</p><p>\u201cEverything is suspiciously quiet,\u201d Rosie murmured.</p><p>That was when a soft waltz started to play.</p><p>\u201cMusic, too?\u201d Zach asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cRomantic music,\u201d Rosie elaborated. \u201cIt\u2019s from Swan Lake.\u201d She moved into the kitchen and turned on the light. There, in the middle of the kitchen table, was another surprise.</p><p>\u201cWine?\u201d Zach asked, following her.</p><p>\u201cLooks that way.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, their children had strategically placed two wineglasses on the kitchen table with one long-stem rose lying between them. A bottle of wine sat in a bucket of ice. Unfortunately, it was a red wine, but Zach wasn\u2019t about to complain.</p><p>\u201cI believe our children have planned a bit of romance for us,\u201d Rosie said sheepishly. \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering, I didn\u2019t put them up to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t, either, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea, do you?\u201d He held out his hand to her. \u201cHow long since we last danced?\u201d He had no recollection of their doing so in the past half-dozen years.</p><p>Rosie laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we ever waltzed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s definitely time to rectify that.\u201d Hand in hand, Zach and Rosie hurried into the family room. He brought her into his embrace and they moved to the classic rhythms of the waltz. Amazing, Zach thought. This seemed so natural.</p><p>When the music ended, Rosie flashed him a radiant smile.</p><p>Zach could never resist one of Rosie\u2019s smiles. Their eyes met in the dim light, and all at once he knew he had to kiss her. He prayed she felt the same way, because waiting a moment longer was entirely out of the question.</p><p>They nearly collided in their eagerness. Rosie had her arms around his neck and his were around her waist. Their kisses were wild and wet and urgent, as though it was necessary to feel and taste as much of each other as possible.</p><p>With the kissing came something else Zach had forgotten, something that had been buried deep in the mud they\u2019d slung at each other during the divorce. He loved Rosie. He\u2019d loved her as a young man, and, despite everything, he loved her now.</p><p>Loved her and wanted her, desperately wanted her.</p><p>It was the little things that Bruce Peyton missed most about his wife. Stephanie had died in a car accident almost two years ago, and he\u2019d thought, he\u2019d hoped, he\u2019d be able to adjust with time. It wasn\u2019t that he hadn\u2019t tried. His friends insisted he date again, and several had set him up with blind dates, but he\u2019d always come away feeling guilty and uneasy. He\u2019d read that a year was long enough to heal substantially from a loss like his. It wasn\u2019t true, not for him. He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever get over her death.</p><p>Stephanie had been his only love. Bruce felt lost without her, and so lonely. Jolene, their daughter, kept Stephanie\u2019s picture on her nightstand because she was afraid she\u2019d forget what her mother had looked like. That tore at Bruce\u2019s heart, but he had no such problem. He carried the memory of her face in his heart. She was with him every minute of every day.</p><p>Although he tried, Bruce just wasn\u2019t good at little-girl stuff. Right now, for instance, Jolene needed a haircut. Her pigtails fell halfway down her back. Her hair had been cut only once in the two years since Stephanie\u2019s death. Not thinking it mattered, Bruce had taken his daughter to the barbershop with him. Seven-year-old Jolene had primly informed him he\u2019d done the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cGirls don\u2019t get their hair cut in the same places boys do,\u201d she told him afterward.</p><p>Now Jolene was saying she wanted her hair short.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to take me to a beauty shop,\u201d his daughter said when he picked her up at the after-school child-care facility.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make an appointment,\u201d Bruce promised her. He chose a name out of the yellow pages, a place that promised great cuts, phoned and wrote down the day and time. Monday at four. Then he dutifully arrived at the mall with Jolene in tow.</p><p>\u201cGet Nai-led,\u201d Jolene said, sounding out the second word. They stood in front of the shop. His daughter nodded approvingly, and he was relieved he\u2019d apparently made the right choice this time.</p><p>Taking her by the hand, Bruce walked into the salon. It was like stepping into an alien world. Women draped with plastic sheets and huge looped curlers twisted about their heads sat in chairs and stared at him as if he was the odd-looking one. The smell was none too pleasant, either. He didn\u2019t know what these women did to themselves or why, but they had his pity.</p><p>Tentatively Bruce walked over to the receptionist\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019m Bruce Peyton,\u201d he managed to get out. \u201cI have an appointment for my daughter.\u201d He leaned against the counter. \u201cShe needs a haircut.\u201d</p><p>The woman, who must\u2019ve been about eighteen, ran her index finger down the appointment schedule. Her fingernail had to be a good two inches long and had something painted on it. He stared hard and realized it was some psychedelic print. Very sixties. But why? He shook his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d she said in a chirpy voice. \u201cShe\u2019s booked with Rachel.\u201d Looking past him, she shouted, \u201cRachel, your four o\u2019clock is here.\u201d</p><p>Bruce stepped away from the counter.</p><p>\u201cRachel will just be a moment. Would you like to take a seat over here and wait?\u201d The receptionist gestured to a row of chairs against the wall, all of which were empty.</p><p>\u201cAh, sure.\u201d Bruce sat down on one of the chairs and Jolene sat next to him. He reached for a magazine and quickly replaced it when he saw the lead article was \u201cTen Ways to Achieve an Orgasm.\u201d In case Jolene tried to sound out the word orgasm, he turned the magazine facedown. Luckily, the latest issue of The Cedar Cove Chronicle was available. He grabbed that and hid his face behind the newspaper before anyone could recognize him.</p><p>Jolene sat patiently at his side, her ankles crossed, gazing avidly at the ultrafeminine world before her.</p><p>Less than five minutes later, a dark-haired woman who didn\u2019t seem to be much older than the receptionist approached him and Jolene.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Rachel.\u201d</p><p>Jolene scooted off the chair and stood. \u201cI need my hair cut.\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled and held out her hand. \u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>Feeling even more awkward, Bruce stood, too, wondering what was expected of him now.</p><p>\u201cYou wait here, Daddy,\u201d Jolene instructed him.</p><p>Rachel\u2019s eyes met his and they shared a brief smile. He had his orders, Bruce figured.</p><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t take more than thirty minutes,\u201d the beautician told him.</p><p>\u201cSure...great.\u201d Bruce sat down with the newspaper, but he soon grew restless. He got up and walked outside the salon and over to the food court. It\u2019d been a while since his last visit to the mall.</p><p>He walked around for a bit and then noticed an electronics store. With at least twenty minutes to kill, he decided to ask about MP3 players. Even if he couldn\u2019t afford one, it didn\u2019t hurt to look. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before he went into the store, Bruce checked his watch to be sure he didn\u2019t inadvertently stay longer than Jolene\u2019s appointment lasted. Stephanie had died on her way to pick up Jolene from kindergarten class and his daughter had been left waiting at the school for hours until someone could come for her. She\u2019d been traumatized and, ever since, had reacted to any lateness, any deviation from a promised schedule, with extreme anxiety.</p><p>A salesman arrived, eager to show him the latest technology. Bruce had a few questions and they were soon involved in a discussion of the pros and cons of different brands. When he checked his watch a second time, a full thirty minutes had passed. Panic rushed through him as he quickly made his excuses and bolted out of the store. He sprinted across the mall, past the food court and toward the salon.</p><p>He could imagine Jolene crying and upset because he\u2019d disappeared. He should\u2019ve told her he was leaving, should\u2019ve explained that he was inside the mall not more than a minute away. He should never have left her.</p><p>Twice since Stephanie\u2019s accident, Jolene had awakened from a nightmare in which Bruce hadn\u2019t arrived to pick her up from school. In her dreams she learned he\u2019d died the same way as her mommy. It had taken her hours to sleep again.</p> <p>Bruce realized he must have made quite a sight tearing into the salon, eyes wild. The entire shop seemed to stare at him.</p><p>Jolene broke the spell with a calm, \u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>His daughter sat at a table with her hands outstretched while Rachel sat across from her, painstakingly painting Jolene\u2019s fingernails.</p><p>Now that his heart had decided to leave his throat and return to his chest, Bruce shoved his hands in his pockets and casually strolled over to them.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t here when Rachel finished my hair.\u201d She tossed her head to and fro the way women did in shampoo commercials on television. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p> <p>Bruce nodded. Hair was hair, but he did think his daughter looked awfully pretty. Of course, he\u2019d thought that before she had her hair cut, too.</p><p>\u201cI got sidetracked in the electronics store,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Rachel said prob\u2019ly happened.\u201d</p><p>The beautician glanced up with the nail polish brush in her hand. \u201cWe lose a lot of men to the electronics store.\u201d</p><p>Bruce would bet they did. Given a choice, just about any man would look for an excuse to get out of this women\u2019s domain.</p><p>\u201cWas she upset?\u201d Bruce asked Rachel.</p> <p>She glanced up again and smiled. \u201cOnly a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRachel said she\u2019d paint my nails. Aren\u2019t they pretty, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>Bruce considered the bright red polish a moment and then nodded in what he hoped was a satisfactory manner. \u201cVery pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost done,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to stay so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d she assured him. \u201cOnce I\u2019m finished, we\u2019ll need five minutes for Jolene\u2019s nails to dry.\u201d She looked up. \u201cOh\u2014the manicure is on the house.\u201d</p><p>He mumbled his thanks. Five minutes seemed an eternity, but this was what he got for losing track of time. While he waited, Bruce paid the receptionist and added a generous tip for the beautician.</p><p>When Jolene was ready, she walked with her arms stretched out in front of her as if she\u2019d seen the Bride of Frankenstein one too many times.</p> <p>\u201cCan I have an ice cream cone?\u201d she asked, gazing across at the food court.</p><p>\u201cYou can if you promise to eat your dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Together\u2014but not hand in hand, since Jolene was concerned about preserving the perfection of her nails\u2014they walked over to Baskin-Robbins and stared into the glass case. Bruce chose vanilla, his favorite. Stephanie had never understood how he could prefer vanilla when he had thirty other flavors to choose from. Jolene was just as predictable. She wanted bubble gum.</p><p>They sat at a small table and Bruce watched his daughter lick away at her blue ice cream. He smiled at her complete absorption. She smiled back, and he thought his heart would stop. In that split second, she resembled her mother so much.</p><p>Every now and then, Bruce caught glimpses of Stephanie in their daughter. In the way her eyes flashed with a smile or the way she moved. It never failed to fill him with an immediate sense of loss and regret.</p><p>A thousand times or more, he\u2019d gone over that final day of Stephanie\u2019s life. It had seemed an ordinary day. Completely routine. If only he\u2019d known...If only he could go back and relive that morning.</p><p>He\u2019d gotten up at seven, as usual, showered and dressed. He\u2019d kissed Stephanie goodbye, never suspecting that in less than ten hours she would be forever taken from him and Jolene.</p><p>\u201cDaddy...\u201d</p><p>Returning to the present, Bruce looked over at his daughter. \u201cWhat, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Rachel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy! The lady who cut my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d he replied absently.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she does a good job of cutting hair.\u201d</p><p>Jolene nodded. \u201cShe wants a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bruce nearly laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cA husband,\u201d Jolene said again. \u201cI heard her talking to the lady next to her, and she said she\u2019s almost thirty. That\u2019s old, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so old,\u201d Bruce assured her, hiding a smile.</p><p>\u201cShe said she wanted to be married before she was thirty.\u201d</p><p>Bruce thought that was a rather personal discussion to be having in a beauty shop, but what did he know about women\u2019s\u2014</p><p>\u201cI think you should marry her, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should marry Rachel,\u201d she repeated, as if that was a perfectly reasonable statement.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>Maryellen was depressed. She\u2019d been depressed for weeks. She sat in the bleachers at the waterfront park, sheltered from the rain, and sipped hot coffee out of a plastic cup. Leaning forward, she rested her elbows on her knees and stared out over the dark waters of the cove.</p><p>Originally she\u2019d planned to meet her mother for lunch, but she\u2019d been stuck at the gallery with a late delivery and had to cancel at the last minute. She didn\u2019t have much of an appetite, anyway, and appreciated this time alone so she could think. Lois Habbersmith, her assistant and friend, had seemed to sense this and hurried her out the door.</p><p>Maryellen had walked down to the waterfront, which was one of her favorite spots. In the summer the city sponsored Thursday night Concerts on the Cove, and the park and every bit of available space would be filled. She\u2019d always loved the music, the laughter, the atmosphere of infectious gaiety.</p><p>This afternoon Maryellen felt little of that carefree summertime energy. She\u2019d lost Jon. It was what she deserved for the despicable way she\u2019d treated him. She\u2019d explained her reasons, but apparently he couldn\u2019t forgive her.</p><p>That was understandable, she supposed. Her experience with men was limited to one dreadful marriage and a father who\u2019d walked through life in a state of emotional paralysis. There were happy childhood memories, but they were few and far between.</p><p>\u201cLois said I\u2019d find you here.\u201d</p><p>Jon\u2019s voice broke into her dark musings and startled Maryellen. She nearly dropped her coffee.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just surprised.\u201d And happy to see him, so happy it was all she could do not to smile and gush and make an idiot of herself. All three of which she\u2019d managed to do any number of times.</p><p>Jon walked up the steps and sank onto the bleacher beside her. He didn\u2019t say anything for a long while. She didn\u2019t, either, and then she couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you something,\u201d she murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>She held her breath, then blurted it out. \u201cThat you\u2019re involved with someone else. I don\u2019t have any claim on you and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d she said, not looking at him. \u201cI figured it out.\u201d</p><p>Jon frowned and shook his head. \u201cYou figured wrong, Maryellen. There hasn\u2019t been another woman in my life almost from the moment we met.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, not knowing what to think.</p><p>He was gazing out at the cove. \u201cI loved you long before you invited me to that ridiculous Halloween party.\u201d</p><p>Now she was sure she\u2019d misunderstood him. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you have a funny way of showing it.\u201d They\u2019d barely talked in weeks. Their conversations, such as they were, had occurred in passing as he picked up or delivered Katie. It seemed he was continually making excuses not to stay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014You didn\u2019t ever want to talk to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains everything,\u201d Maryellen said\u2014with only a little sarcasm in her tone.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid if I talked to you, I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop myself from telling you....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve decided to leave Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d she cried. He\u2019d just finished saying he loved her! She already knew how deeply he cared for their daughter. Katie needed her father, and the awful truth was that Maryellen needed Jon, too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting the house up for sale first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Numb with shock and pain, Maryellen could barely acknowledge his words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already given my notice at The Lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>It was too much. More than she could bear. Each word was like a knife in her heart, the pain intolerable, impossible to ignore. Burying her face in both hands, she laid her head on her knees and burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen...\u201d His voice seemed faint and far away. Then he placed his hand on her spine, as if she were a small child in need of comfort.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, raising her head just enough to speak. \u201cIf you love me and you love Katie? Why would you leave us?\u201d She\u2019d been such a fool. When she\u2019d first realized she was pregnant, she saw Jon as little more than a sperm donor, never guessing how important he would become to her or their child.</p><p>Jon didn\u2019t answer. She knew what he was doing\u2014the same thing her father had done. Rejecting and hurting those he loved most.</p><p>\u201cYou never met my father, did you?\u201d she said, struggling to keep the pain out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have a great deal in common with him. He destroyed the people he loved, too.\u201d Pride carried her to her feet and she stood. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to leave, there isn\u2019t anything I can say to stop you. The thing is, Jon, I love you, too. I didn\u2019t want to love you and I tried everything to keep my emotions out of this, but...but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>She took another deep breath. \u201cI assumed it would be easy to have a baby on my own. Women do it all the time. But it\u2019s hard, so much harder than I imagined. You were there for me and for Katie, and slowly, little by little, I realized my mistake. I began to see how important a father\u2019s role is to a child. And...to a mother.\u201d She wiped the tears from her cheek. \u201cPerhaps this is what I deserve, but it sure as hell isn\u2019t what Katie deserves. If you walk away from her now, you\u2019re a bigger fool than I ever was.\u201d She started to leave, but his words stopped her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>He briefly closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got a record, Maryellen. A prison record. You once asked me where I learned to cook. Well, guess what, it was behind bars. I couldn\u2019t tell you for fear you\u2019d take Katie away from me.\u201d</p><p>That explained some, but not enough. She lowered herself to the bench again so they sat side by side. \u201cI\u2019d never do that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI trusted someone else, someone I loved. I learned a painful lesson. It\u2019s not one I\u2019m eager to repeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother woman?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, my half brother.\u201d He didn\u2019t add any details, and this seemed all he was willing to divulge.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you telling me now?\u201d she asked. If he was leaving, anyway, it seemed pointless to admit the truth.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond.</p> <p>Maryellen refused to let the matter drop. \u201cWhat made me so trustworthy all of a sudden, especially if you\u2019re about to drop out of my life and Katie\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He had no answer, but that didn\u2019t surprise her. Jon rarely volunteered information about himself. It used to be a game she played when he came into the gallery\u2014getting him to chat about himself, learning what she could about him. Even now she knew damn little.</p><p>\u201cThis might surprise you, but I suspected you might have done jail time,\u201d she said. It was one of the endless possibilities she\u2019d considered late at night, when she couldn\u2019t sleep. It wasn\u2019t one she\u2019d taken all that seriously, just as she\u2019d dismissed the possibility that he was on the run or an amnesiac or involved in some equally bizarre scenario. Another woman had seemed the most likely....</p><p>A scowl darkened his face. \u201cNot the kind of question you want to ask, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the charge?\u201d</p><p>There was a lengthy silence. \u201cI was convicted of dealing cocaine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is where your half brother comes in?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cThe two of us were total opposites. He was the perfect son and I was the starving artist. The disreputable kid. My dad and stepmom favored Jim. He was ambitious, a businessman-in-the-making. He was everything they wanted in a son and I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time he\u2019d mentioned any family member other than his grandfather and the fact that Katie had been his dead mother\u2019s name. His grandfather had left him the land on which Jon had built his house. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jim now?\u201d</p><p>His face tightened. \u201cDead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jon, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, but she saw him swallow hard. He set his foot against the back of the bleacher in front of them and slid his hands inside his pockets. \u201cWe lived together, and I was scraping by selling my pictures. I\u2019d take my camera and hike into the forest and get as many shots as I could afford to develop. Jim moved in with me one summer and for a while it was great.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen tucked her own hands in her pockets, but leaned closer to him, pressing her shoulder to his, needing to touch him.</p><p>\u201cJim was dealing cocaine. I swear on Katie\u2019s life that I didn\u2019t have a clue what he was doing. He was in college and his friends were the same upwardly mobile type he was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was selling to them?\u201d</p><p>Jon nodded. \u201cFool that I was, I didn\u2019t put two and two together. Jim always seemed to have money, always seemed to have whatever he wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne night the police came and dragged us both out of bed. They found the stuff. While I was screaming that it was planted and that we were innocent, Jim was selling me to the cops, saying it was mine.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen placed her hand on his forearm, and he gripped her fingers with his own, squeezing hard.</p><p>\u201cMy brother testified against me, and my father claimed\u2014well, he lied and said I was the one with the drug problem and that Jim had only recently moved into the house and couldn\u2019t be involved.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, imagining that kind of betrayal. First his brother and then his father, too. \u201cHow could he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad believed what Jim told him, I guess. He wanted to protect one of his sons\u2014but not the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen or talked to my father since the day I was sentenced. I want nothing to do with him. I don\u2019t know how I would\u2019ve survived without my grandfather\u2019s support. He did everything he could to help me.\u201d</p><p>She understood more and more of what he\u2019d been through, the experiences that had shaped him.</p><p>\u201cJim died while I was in prison. My father wrote to tell me, but I never wrote him back.\u201d He didn\u2019t hide his pain or bitterness.</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in prison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sentenced to fifteen years.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. Jon, who loved the out-of-doors, had been locked in a jail cell.</p><p>\u201cI served seven of those years, and it was seven years of hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim walked away scot-free?\u201d</p><p>Jon looked down at their linked fingers and he squeezed so hard she nearly cried out from the pain. \u201cHe got a slap on the wrist with probation and then died of a heroin overdose the year before I was paroled.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen desperately wanted to comfort him, to hold him in her arms.</p><p>\u201cNow you know.\u201d His eyes were cold as stones as he held her gaze. \u201cYou can give this information to any court in the land and take my daughter away from me.\u201d</p><p>Now she knew why he was putting the land his grandfather had left him up for sale and selling the house he\u2019d built with his own hands. Why he was quitting his job. Leaving Cedar Cove.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me,\u201d she whispered. He was relinquishing everything that mattered to him because he believed he was going to lose it, anyway. Because the minute he lowered his guard, he took the risk that she, too, would betray him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He didn\u2019t bother to deny it. \u201cThe only person I can trust in this world is myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Katie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a baby....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t she deserve to know her father?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened again.</p><p>\u201cEventually you\u2019ll have to trust someone. You can\u2019t close yourself off from everyone. Sooner or later, you\u2019ve got to stop running.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her, didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI can deal with it if you don\u2019t want me in your life, but Katie needs you. Jon, please don\u2019t walk away from her.\u201d She wanted to ask the same thing for herself, but wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou know everything now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t try to get sole custody of Katie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably could, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she cried in frustration. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening to a word I\u2019ve said? Katie needs you.... I need you. I\u2019m not going to do anything to keep you out of Katie\u2019s life. Or mine.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWould you marry a felon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and then gave a jerky nod. She watched as he thrust his hands back inside his pockets, hunching his shoulders forward.</p><p>She blinked hard to keep the tears from spilling onto her face. \u201cIt would be the greatest honor of my life to marry you, to be the mother to your children and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking Katie could use a little brother or sister.\u201d</p><p>A tentative smile came first and then Jon broke into the most wonderful deep-chested laugh. The sound of it drifted toward the cove, competing with the sharp cry of the seagulls.</p><p>Before Maryellen knew it, they were both standing and she was securely wrapped in his embrace. They hugged each other tightly and then he kissed her again and again.</p><p>Maryellen raised her face and wept openly as Jon\u2019s kisses traveled over her forehead, her cheeks, her chin, moving toward her lips. When their mouths finally met, it was a kiss that spoke of faith and trust and love, and she returned those feelings in full measure.</p><p>She was breathless by the time he eased his mouth from hers. \u201cI want us to get married soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll never threaten to leave us again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he said, and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cPromise you\u2019ll always love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d Another deep kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d he asked, his eyes so full of love it was almost painful to see.</p><p>\u201cLots more,\u201d she whispered. In fact, Maryellen was just getting started.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>Home from a Saturday afternoon spent volunteering at the Humane Society Animal Shelter, Grace pulled into her driveway. She enjoyed her work, found real purpose in helping animals. There was such satisfaction in seeing lost pets reunited with their owners and in connecting abandoned or mistreated cats and dogs with people who\u2019d love them.</p><p>The vet had a notice about the Humane Society on her bulletin board, which Grace had seen the afternoon she\u2019d taken Buttercup in. She\u2019d decided to respond to the call for volunteers. Buttercup had come into her life at exactly the right moment and Grace wanted others to find the same pleasure.</p><p>Her first thought once she\u2019d parked the car was to retrieve her mail. Although she tried not to be hopeful, she couldn\u2019t help looking for a response from Cliff. Two weeks earlier she\u2019d written him, reiterating how sorry she was. Although it meant having to swallow her considerable pride, Grace had asked him to give her a second chance. So far, she hadn\u2019t heard from him, and now, after two weeks, she suspected she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She walked to the house with Buttercup trotting behind her. The golden retriever sniffed at her legs suspiciously, recognizing the scent of other animals. Buttercup actually seemed a bit jealous and required lots of attention on those Saturdays.</p><p>\u201cDid you miss me, girl?\u201d she asked, stroking Buttercup\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there wasn\u2019t a single dog there as wonderful as you.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang and Grace absently reached for the receiver. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, still fondling the dog\u2019s ears.</p><p>\u201cGrace? It\u2019s Stan Lockhart.\u201d</p><p>This was completely unexpected. She couldn\u2019t imagine what her best friend\u2019s ex-husband had to say to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked coolly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in town and I was wondering if I could stop by for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Grace wanted to refuse him, but didn\u2019t have a good excuse. \u201cCan I ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia and Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I won\u2019t stay long.\u201d</p><p>She reluctantly agreed. As soon as she hung up, Grace hurriedly punched in Olivia\u2019s phone number. \u201cWhy do you think he wants to talk to me? I could really do without this,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cHe probably needs a shoulder to cry on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him look elsewhere,\u201d Grace muttered. She had enough problems of her own without dealing with his. As far as she was concerned, Stan Lockhart was a sore loser. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it would hurt to hear him out,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a shock.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he has, Grace mused. For the first time in his life, Stan Lockhart couldn\u2019t manipulate Olivia! \u201cDo you want me to phone you after he leaves?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Olivia hesitated. \u201cNot particularly. Stan\u2019s out of my life, and frankly I don\u2019t care what he says.\u201d</p><p>Grace marveled at her friend. If their positions had been reversed, she\u2019d be sitting by the phone waiting for a report. She\u2019d want to hear all about her ex-husband\u2019s regrets.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, Stan arrived, looking decidedly unhappy.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she said, holding open the screen for him.</p><p>Stan entered and she showed him into the living room. Buttercup wandered over to sniff him; apparently he passed muster because the dog wandered back to the chair where Grace normally sat and lay down.</p><p>\u201cWould you like something to drink?\u201d she asked Stan, only to be polite.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any Scotch?\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, right. Even if she did, she wouldn\u2019t offer it to him. \u201cNo, sorry. Coffee or tea.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNothing, thanks.\u201d</p><p>She gestured for him to sit down, which he did on the sofa across from her. \u201cOlivia\u2019s actually going to do it, isn\u2019t she?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean marry Jack, the answer is yes.\u201d The arrangements were in full swing. Seth and Justine were going to hold the reception at their restaurant, following a private ceremony at the gazebo in the waterfront park.</p><p>\u201cJames and Selina are flying in, she said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia asked if they would.\u201d Grace didn\u2019t mean to make him feel worse, but it was important to Olivia that her children be present.</p> <p>\u201cI thought she\u2019d have one of the other judges perform the ceremony,\u201d he said. \u201cBut apparently not. Who\u2019s this pastor friend of hers, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDave Flemming. He\u2019s at the Methodist church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Grace was about to ask if there was a point to his visit when Stan glanced up. \u201cThis is what I deserve, you know?\u201d</p><p>Despite what she knew about Stan, Grace felt sorry for him. The news of Olivia and Jack\u2019s engagement shouldn\u2019t have come as a shock but obviously had. Now his regrets about Olivia would be permanent. There\u2019d be no further chance to make amends, to start over. Oh, yes, she understood about regrets. They were something she\u2019d lived with for quite some time now.</p><p>\u201cI made a big mistake myself recently,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d He sounded skeptical.</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cI hurt someone I care about and there\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI feel the same way. I was such a fool. When Jordan drowned...\u201d He paused and stared down at the carpet. \u201cI went out to the cemetery the other day and visited my son\u2019s grave.\u201d He drew a hand along the side of his jaw. \u201cIt\u2019s funny. It\u2019s been\u2014what, sixteen years? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get over it. I still can\u2019t believe my oldest son is dead.\u201d He slowly rubbed his palms together, his eyes closed in pain.</p><p>\u201cIt was as if I self-destructed after we lost Jordan,\u201d he continued, opening his eyes. \u201cI did the best I could with the mess I\u2019d made of my life after I married Marge, but it was never a good marriage, and we both knew it.\u201d</p><p>Grace\u2019s heart softened. Although she\u2019d been furious with Stan for what he\u2019d done to Olivia and his two surviving children, she remembered that he\u2019d been a decent father.</p><p>\u201cTo tell you the truth, I wasn\u2019t surprised when Marge decided she wanted out. In a lot of ways, I think she did us both a favor. My first thought when she asked for the divorce was that I\u2019d move heaven and earth to get Olivia back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s a good guy.\u201d</p><p>Stan frowned. \u201cI just don\u2019t see the two of them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a half smile and shrugged. \u201cI guess you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>Stan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking I might come back to Cedar Cove. But under the present circumstances, I\u2019m not so sure that would be wise.\u201d</p><p>Grace knew he was referring to Olivia\u2019s coming marriage, and she knew he was conceding defeat.</p><p>\u201cStill, Justine and Seth are here and so is Leif,\u201d he added as though thinking aloud. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d enjoy being a grandfather as much as I do. I missed so much when my own children were growing up, I want to enjoy every second I can with my grandkids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d she told him. \u201cI have two.\u201d</p><p>His gaze went past her to the fireplace mantel, where Grace kept the latest photos of her grandchildren. \u201cI can certainly see you in the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Grace stared at Katie\u2019s picture and was unable to squelch a smile of pleasure. Stan couldn\u2019t have given her a greater compliment.</p><p>\u201cI never did tell you how sorry I was to hear about Dan.\u201d</p><p>Grace blinked quickly and nodded. She wished Dan had lived long enough to know his grandchildren. Tyler and Katie might have made a difference, given him a reason to live. Then again, perhaps not. Dan\u2019s life had been troubled, and very little seemed to touch him. He was closer to Kelly than anyone, yet that hadn\u2019t stopped him from running away during her pregnancy. In the end, despite everything, death had seemed preferable to the suffering\u2014the guilt and depression\u2014he\u2019d endured in life.</p><p>Stan got to his feet. \u201cActually, I came to ask if you\u2019d do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to order a bottle of good champagne for Olivia and Jack on their wedding night.\u201d He slipped his hands into his pockets. \u201cIt would be a bit awkward coming from me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take care of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>Apparently Stan didn\u2019t know Jack was a recovering alcoholic. \u201cI\u2019ll see to everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d Stan started for the door, then turned back. \u201cGrace,\u201d he said, looking at her as if he were seeing her for the first time. \u201cWould you like to go to dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>She was as surprised by his invitation as she\u2019d been by his phone call. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>He gestured vaguely. \u201cWhat about tonight? I know it\u2019s last minute and all.\u201d Then, shaking his head, he seemed to change his mind. \u201cForget I asked. It\u2019s probably not a good idea, anyway.\u201d He reached for the doorknob.</p><p>\u201cStan,\u201d she said, stopping him. She didn\u2019t know what had prompted her to do this. But Stan was lonely. She was lonely. And she\u2019d developed a new sympathy for him during this brief visit. She\u2019d seen a little deeper, past the arrogance she\u2019d always associated with Stan.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cLet\u2019s go to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte Jefferson and her small band of supporters marched single-file down Harbor Street, holding their pickets high. Whenever she could, Charlotte waved her message at oncoming traffic to ensure that the drivers had ample opportunity to read her sign. Several people honked their horns.</p><p>Ben Rhodes marched with her. Together they\u2019d attended countless meetings, talked with elected officials and health-care corporations, studied what other municipalities had done. Without results. After all these months, they were no closer to getting a health clinic in Cedar Cove than they were to taking a giant leap and landing on the moon. There\u2019d been several minor attempts to appease them\u2014but it wasn\u2019t enough. The time had come to take a stand. To demonstrate!</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look now,\u201d Ben said, bending toward her and whispering in her ear, \u201cbut it looks like we\u2019re about to have company.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the sheriff\u2019s patrol car pulled up alongside Charlotte. Troy Davis parked at the curb and climbed out of his Crown Victoria, pausing long enough to hoist up his belt before he walked over to her.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Afternoon, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Sheriff Davis,\u201d she greeted primly. The sign seemed to grow unaccountably heavier and she lowered it. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, as if it was a perfectly normal thing to see her marching down the main street of town, hefting a protest sign.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a permit for this little rally of yours?\u201d He looked past her at the string of fifteen men and women, all regular attendees at the local seniors\u2019 center.</p><p>\u201cA permit?\u201d she repeated. The truth was, Charlotte hadn\u2019t thought she\u2019d need one. At first the demonstration had consisted of only her and Ben. They\u2019d decided to form their own protest and stand silently by the stoplight at Harbor and Heron. However, as soon as word got out, a dozen or so others had asked to join them. Charlotte couldn\u2019t refuse her friends.</p><p>\u201cOfficer, perhaps I could answer your questions,\u201d Ben said, stepping closer to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met,\u201d Sheriff Davis said, eyeing Ben suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cBen Rhodes,\u201d Charlotte murmured, gesturing from one man to the other, \u201cmeet the local fuzz.\u201d</p><p>Ben chuckled; Sheriff Davis didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhose idea was this, anyway?\u201d the sheriff asked.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d Ben insisted.</p><p>\u201cNow, Ben,\u201d Charlotte said, patting him gently on the forearm. \u201cBoth of us came up with the idea.\u201d</p><p>Her friends and allies gathered around. \u201cAnd we asked to join her,\u201d Laura said, edging her way closer so that she stood directly in front of Troy Davis\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Helen echoed, moving next to Laura, although she was so short she had to tilt her chin up in order to get a good look. Any menacing expression was wasted on the sheriff, who didn\u2019t bother to glance down. In fact, it seemed Sheriff Davis was having difficulty keeping a straight face. Charlotte, however, was not amused.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way we have of getting heard in this city,\u201d Bess said. She waved her protest sign, nearly clobbering him in the head when she momentarily lost control of the heavy wooden stick.</p><p>\u201cDoes Olivia know what you\u2019re up to?\u201d Sheriff Davis asked Charlotte, ignoring the others.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter has nothing to do with this,\u201d Charlotte said, although her voice faltered momentarily. Olivia was her one hesitation about this protest. Charlotte knew her daughter objected to her involvement\u2014but what Olivia didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t feel it\u2019s any of the judge\u2019s business,\u201d Ben added.</p><p>Charlotte thanked him with a small smile. He understood her dilemma and had offered his advice. These days, she often listened to what Ben had to say. He was reasonable and wise in his counsel; he\u2019d proved that over and over. He\u2019d also proved something else, which the others didn\u2019t know\u2014that he was an excellent kisser. She blushed at the thought.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe I was speaking to you, sir,\u201d the sheriff said.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis, that was completely unnecessary,\u201d Charlotte objected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDoes Olivia know?\u201d he asked again, and the friendliness was gone from his voice.</p><p>\u201cShe knew about it.

However, if you don\u2019t have a permit, I\u2019m going to have to ask you to disperse and leave the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t causing any trouble,\u201d Ben said.</p><p>\u201cWe come in peace,\u201d Laura insisted, sounding as if she\u2019d just alighted from an alien spaceship.</p><p>\u201cBut we mean business!\u201d Bess\u2019s sign flashed back and forth in the sheriff\u2019s face.</p><p>Glaring at her, he caught the wooden stem with one hand and took it from her. \u201cMrs. Ferryman, kindly go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was his third-grade teacher,\u201d Bess whispered to Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cOfficer, I appreciate your problem, but we are on a mission,\u201d Ben started. \u201cWe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a mission, as well,\u201d Troy Davis said calmly. He held up his hand to attract the attention of the small protest rally. \u201cI want you all to cease and desist, and go home peacefully. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d Laura punctuated her comment by pounding the wooden stick against the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cI do believe,\u201d Charlotte said cheerfully, \u201cthat you\u2019ll need to arrest us first.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis cast an exasperated look at the small group.</p> <p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Ben warned, his voice low and uncertain, \u201cdon\u2019t give the man any ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis knows how important a health clinic is to our community.\u201d</p><p>The lawman nodded. \u201cI do know, and personally I agree with you, but the law is the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll handcuff us?\u201d Helen asked, tugging at Charlotte\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>Charlotte could see that her friend was wavering. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she assured her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t count on it, ladies.\u201d Sheriff Davis released a snap on his belt and brought out a pair of handcuffs. He held them up and dangled them from his fingers for all to see.</p><p>Bess gasped and raised her hand to her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be strip-searched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any guarantees,\u201d Sheriff Davis said, looking at her as though he had X-ray vision.</p> <p>Bess shrank back behind Laura.</p><p>Charlotte strengthened her resolve and hoisted up her sign once more. She\u2019d come this far and wasn\u2019t about to back down now. Ben and her friends would have to make their own decisions. She\u2019d already made hers.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes,\u201d Sheriff Davis informed them. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t dispersed in that time, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to call for backup and you\u2019ll all be arrested for unlawful assembly.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte knew what she had to do. She turned to face her dearest friends\u2014Helen, Bess, Laura and the others. She hated the thought of them in a cold, damp cell in the basement of the police station, but there were times a person had to take a stand. \u201cThe sheriff states that unless we disperse, we\u2019re headed for the slammer.\u201d</p><p>The group cried out in protest.</p><p>\u201cWe have five minutes. As for me, I\u2019m staying right where I am. Each one of us should make our own decision.\u201d Having said that, she placed a hand on Bess\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll understand if you don\u2019t want to go to jail.\u201d</p><p>Bess considered her words, and then seemed to steel herself mentally. \u201cI\u2019m staying,\u201d she announced, glaring defiantly at the sheriff. \u201cTroy Davis, I remember you cheated on that spelling test. I never should\u2019ve voted for you. You aren\u2019t to be trusted.\u201d</p><p>The small group gathered into a tight knot, buzzing with indecision. To her surprise, it was Ben who raised his hands and spoke. \u201cPerhaps we should reconsider.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of loud protests instantly followed. Ben looked at Troy Davis and shrugged. \u201cI tried, Officer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you didn\u2019t try hard enough.\u201d The sheriff glanced down at his watch\u2014five minutes must be up\u2014and then without another word, marched over to his patrol car. He turned his head and spoke into the small transmitter attached to his shoulder. He was making good on his threat, Charlotte realized, and calling for backup.</p><p>A few minutes later, two patrol cars rolled into view. Charlotte groaned inwardly.</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t going to like this one bit.</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>Roy McAfee received the long-awaited phone call the second week of April, almost a month after Davis had sent the water bottle found in Maxwell Russell\u2019s car to the county lab for testing. He asked Roy to stop by his office as soon as possible.</p><p>Within ten minutes of that call, Roy was headed out the front door of his office.</p><p>\u201cWas that Sheriff Davis?\u201d Corrie asked, glancing up from her desk as he breezed past his wife.</p><p>Roy nodded and reached for his coat. \u201cApparently the lab found something.\u201d He\u2019d known they would, and he felt vindicated. Now maybe they could get somewhere with this case.</p><p>\u201cThe sheriff isn\u2019t exactly the most popular man in town at the moment,\u201d Corrie said as she pointed to the latest edition of The Cedar Cove Chronicle.</p><p>Roy tried unsuccessfully to disguise a smile. The front page of The Chronicle had shown a photograph of a disgruntled Sheriff Davis and two deputies handcuffing a group of senior citizens. Roy would say one thing\u2014this small and lively band of retirees had certainly gotten their message out.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help feeling sorry for Davis,\u201d Roy murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf course your sympathies would lie with the lawman, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, Mrs. Jefferson and her friends have a good point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other ways of getting the city to provide a health clinic without violating the law.\u201d</p><p>Roy should know better than to argue with Corrie; as usual, she had an immediate comeback. \u201cThe article said Mrs. Jefferson and Mr. Rhodes have done everything by the book and didn\u2019t get anywhere, because of the budget cuts. You and I both know what it\u2019s like to ram our heads against City Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis was only doing his job.\u201d Frankly, Roy wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be the one responsible for escorting a group of old people to jail. From what he\u2019d heard, it had been a madhouse, with several of the ladies demanding lawyers and going on about their constitutional rights. Apparently they\u2019d viewed too many Law &amp; Order reruns.</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known you\u2019d side with your friend,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cHow would you feel, though, if that had been your mother or mine?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cMy mother\u2019s been gone for a lot of years and as for yours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even start, Roy McAfee,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>But Roy saw that Corrie was trying not to laugh. On impulse, he walked around her desk and soundly kissed her.</p><p>Corrie looked up at him. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re nothing like your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said, pleading innocence. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, she steered him toward the door.</p><p>Roy decided to walk the fifteen minutes to the sheriff\u2019s office. His gut told him they were close to uncovering Russell\u2019s secrets.</p><p>Troy Davis appeared to be waiting for him. He gestured to the chair and then shoved a file at him before Roy even had a chance to sit down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe toxicology report.\u201d</p><p>Roy reached for it and flipped it open. He scanned the first three pages before his eyes landed on flunitrazepam. He raised his eyes to the sheriff\u2019s. \u201cThat drug\u2014what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrand name is Rohypnol.\u201d</p><p>That was a name Roy recognized. The date-rape drug, as it was commonly called. He\u2019d seen the effects of it during his years on the force. It\u2019d been referred to as \u201croofies\u201d when it first hit the streets in the early nineties.</p><p>Very clever choice, Roy mused as he read over the report. Not the type of drug anyone would typically use to kill a man over fifty. \u201cNo wonder it took the lab a month to find it,\u201d he murmured, thinking aloud.</p><p>\u201cWhoever killed him dissolved it in the bottled water. It\u2019s tasteless and odorless\u2014and it\u2019s a potent tranquilizer. When it\u2019s given in large doses, the obvious happens.\u201d</p><p>Roy knew that, too. A large enough dose would have lethal consequences.</p><p>Roy set the file on the sheriff\u2019s desk. \u201cAll that confirms is what we\u2019ve both suspected. Russell was murdered.\u201d Unfortunately, the toxicology report didn\u2019t reveal who\u2019d poisoned him or why.</p><p>The sheriff relaxed in his chair and steepled his fingers as he rested his hands against his abdomen. He looked directly at Roy. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been Beldon. He had opportunity.\u201d</p><p>Years of police work and intuition said otherwise. At one point, Roy had had his suspicions. There\u2019d still been a lot of missing facts, and he hadn\u2019t wanted to cloud the issue with emotion. That was the reason he\u2019d felt he couldn\u2019t be Beldon\u2019s friend. In the time since, Roy had come to like and trust the other man.</p><p>Bob claimed not to recognize his old army friend, which left motive in question. But even if he had recognized him, that wasn\u2019t cause enough to murder him, in Roy\u2019s opinion. \u201cFrankly, I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis gave him a hint of a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t see it falling that way myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget, the bottle was in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t automatically clear Beldon, but it suggested Russell had brought the water with him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think it could\u2019ve been a random killing?\u201d Roy asked. There seemed to be more of them these days.</p><p>He could tell that Davis had considered the same idea. \u201cPerhaps, but I think it\u2019s unlikely.\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. Too many factors in this case, including the method used, led him to believe the murder hadn\u2019t been a random anything. Whoever they were dealing with was smart. And vicious.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this was the first attempt on Russell\u2019s life, either,\u201d Roy murmured.</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly,\u201d the sheriff said. He straightened, leaning toward his desk. \u201cThe car accident that killed his wife sounds mighty convenient to me. I read the report, but there\u2019s nothing I can put my finger on. No real evidence.\u201d</p><p>The crash had been attributed to driver error. In light of recent events, he wondered. Two of the men who\u2019d been together in the jungle that day were dead and both had died under peculiar circumstances.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Dan Sherman?\u201d Roy asked. \u201cAre you convinced it was suicide?\u201d</p><p>The sheriff didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNo doubt. He left that letter, too.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t like the route his mind was taking him. Two men were dead, one of them murdered. If Bob wasn\u2019t involved\u2014and both Troy Davis and Roy were sure he wasn\u2019t\u2014then that led Roy to one conclusion.</p><p>\u201cBob Beldon\u2019s in danger,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Davis sat back. \u201cFunny you should say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the same feeling myself. I went out to talk to him yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>A chill went up Roy\u2019s spine.</p> <p>\u201cI suggested he might want to take an extended vacation while we check this theory out,\u201d the sheriff continued.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>Troy Davis frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s a stubborn man. Bob said he\u2019d done all the running he intended to do. Said anyone who wants to kill him is welcome to try.\u201d</p><p>Roy guessed Peggy hadn\u2019t been around for that conversation.</p><p>Troy shook his head. \u201cNot only that, he says he can\u2019t leave. Jack Griffin asked Bob to be his best man, and Bob intends to do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst week of May.\u201d</p><p>Roy mulled that over and nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s been over a year since Russell died,\u201d he said. \u201cIf nothing\u2019s happened in all this time, then perhaps nothing will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Troy Davis returned.</p><p>But his tone of voice convinced Roy the sheriff didn\u2019t believe it. For that matter, neither did he.</p><p>Over the last few months, he\u2019d come to like Bob and Peggy. He\u2019d consider it a personal affront if his friend turned up dead.</p> <p>Rosie waited anxiously until she heard the rat-a-tat-tat on the apartment door. Leaping up from the sofa, she hurried to answer it. She was halfway across the living room when the door opened and Zach stepped inside.</p><p>As if it\u2019d been weeks since she\u2019d last seen him, Rosie flew into his embrace. Zach wrapped his arms around her waist, half lifting her from the floor. Not a second passed before his mouth found hers. Their kisses were deep and urgent, reminiscent of their college days. The spark that had been missing during the last few years of their marriage was back\u2014and bright enough to start a fire.</p><p>When Zach set her feet on the carpet again, Rosie\u2019s head was spinning with desire. Forgotten was her intent to discuss so many of the pressing issues that clamored for attention. Instead, all she could think about was the warmth of his touch and the need he created within her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think meeting like this is a little ridiculous?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She rose to her tiptoes and kissed him.</p><p>Zach kissed her back and all too soon they were in the bedroom\u2014his bedroom. Two days earlier, they\u2019d ended up in hers, and the time before that they hadn\u2019t even made it to a bed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to talk,\u201d Rosie reminded him in the aftermath of their lovemaking. Her head rested against his naked shoulder. They were sprawled on top of the bedcovers, with her arm draped across his waist.</p> <p>\u201cI know, but when I see you the last thing I feel like doing is talking.\u201d</p><p>Rosie understood perfectly. She was as hungry for Zach as he was for her.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell the kids where you were going?\u201d she asked, a little embarrassed that their children might have guessed they\u2019d turned the apartment into a love nest. Even the old-fashioned term made her wince.</p><p>Zach chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>Rosie sighed and rubbed her cheek against his chest, loving the warm feel of his skin. Closing her eyes, she inhaled Zach\u2019s scent\u2014distinctively his and almost enough to arouse her all over again. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we talk, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Zach agreed, \u201cbut unfortunately I can\u2019t seem to keep my hands off you.\u201d</p><p>Rosie had to admit she liked this resurgence of their love life\u2014liked it a lot. As for wasting their precious time at the apartment in bed, well, she didn\u2019t have any complaints.</p><p>\u201cThe kids aren\u2019t blind, you know,\u201d Zach said as his hand made slow, lazy circles on the small of her back. \u201cThey have a fairly good idea who I\u2019m sneaking out to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison said as much,\u201d Rosie told him.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so the kids are in favor of our reconciliation,\u201d Zach said, sounding serious, \u201cbut are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we ready to get back together? Should we? I love you, Rosie, and you love me. I\u2019ve always loved you, but even now I don\u2019t understand how two people who genuinely love each other could let themselves get divorced.\u201d</p><p>Rosie nodded. \u201cI made a lot of mistakes,\u201d she said soberly.</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d Zach was quick to admit. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rehash everything we did wrong, but on the other hand, I\u2019m not willing to ignore what happened and then repeat our mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d The thought of going through that terrible tension again was intolerable. She couldn\u2019t live like that, and she knew Zach couldn\u2019t, either. Nor could they inflict this nightmare on their children a second time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to continue teaching,\u201d Rosie said. Her contribution to their problems had to do with the fact that she\u2019d volunteered for absolutely every committee, group, field day and task force that came up. She\u2019d developed a reputation as the consummate volunteer, the woman who couldn\u2019t say no.</p><p>Before the divorce, she had commitments and obligations that took her away from the house most days and every night of the week. It had started when Zach was so busy preparing tax returns. She was lonely and looking for a social outlet, a way to be part of the community. Her volunteering had grown into a time-consuming monster that had threatened to destroy her and her family.</p><p>\u201cI always wanted to be the perfect wife and mother,\u201d she whispered, saddened by the memory of her failings.</p><p>Zach kissed the top of her head. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I got so caught up in everything, I wasn\u2019t any kind of mother at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not going to listen to you beat yourself up,\u201d Zach said. \u201cEspecially when I was doing plenty wrong myself.\u201d</p><p>His hold on her tightened slightly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t wreck our marriage single-handedly, Rosie. I let my ego replace common sense. You were right about Janice Lamond, but I was too blind to see what she was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so jealous,\u201d Rosie confessed.</p><p>\u201cSo was I, especially when you started dating that widower.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know Zach had been jealous. The warm glow it gave her was childish, but she basked in the feeling, anyway. \u201cLike I told you, we only went out that once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was much more, and it confused the hell out of me.\u201d He laughed softly and continued to stroke her back. \u201cWe were supposed to be divorced, and yet the thought of you going out with another man had me seeing red.\u201d</p><p>Rosie loved it. \u201cWell, you can imagine how I felt when we were married and I thought you were involved with another woman. Jealous doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen again,\u201d he promised her.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get caught up in volunteering again, either,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe the occasional short-term thing, but that\u2019s it. I know how to set boundaries now.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019ve also discovered that I like teaching\u2014I\u2019d forgotten how much. The hours are great with the kids\u2019 schedules, and when I return at the end of the day, I appreciate my home and family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help around the house more,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d That had been another of their problems. Because she was supposed to be a stay-at-home mother, Zach\u2014and the children, too\u2014had come to rely on her to do everything, to fulfill every need, to be the perfect housekeeper, cook, fixer, scheduler, chauffeur and hostess. To be responsible for everything on the domestic front, in other words.</p><p>\u201cI can make dinner two nights a week,\u201d Zach told her. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from the cooking channel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle getting dinner ready another three,\u201d she said. Now that Rosie had more time, she\u2019d found out she actually enjoyed cooking.</p><p>\u201cAllison\u2019s learned a thing or two about helping out in the kitchen,\u201d Zach said. \u201cI think she\u2019d like being in charge of one dinner a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat leaves us with only one night open,\u201d she said, thinking that perhaps they could trade off on it.</p><p>\u201cOne night a week for you and me to go on a date,\u201d Zach said firmly.</p><p>\u201cA date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for us to be together, Rosie. Just you and me. Do you realize we lived in the same house and barely spoke? We talked, but we were both too busy and too distracted to really listen to each other. You\u2019re my best friend, and I\u2019ve missed you and missed having you in my life. I believe that not spending time with each other is what got us into trouble.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he was right. Perhaps that was one of the reasons their marriage had fallen apart. With Zach spending long hours at the office and her filling every spare minute with charity projects and volunteer positions, they\u2019d lost their focus. They\u2019d forgotten about each other; everything else had come first.</p><p>Raising herself onto one elbow, she kissed his jaw. \u201cHave I told you lately how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have,\u201d Zach whispered. \u201cOh, Rosie, Rosie, it feels so good to have you in my arms again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe kids want us to remarry,\u201d she said.</p><p>Until then, neither Zach nor Rosie had said it aloud.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She heard the hesitation in his voice. \u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d</p><p>Rosie nestled closer to him. \u201cExcited...and a little afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>They\u2019d both said and done things that burdened the future. Could they maintain this new resolve, continue to nurture their relationship and each other?</p><p>\u201cWe need to be very sure, Zach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. When we do remarry, and I believe we will,\u201d he said, kissing her again, \u201cit has to be forever, with one hundred percent total commitment from each of us.\u201d Zach met her eyes, a look of intensity in his. \u201cWe\u2019ve opened that door marked Divorce and walked through it once.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cIt could easily become a swinging door. With every argument, every disagreement, we can decide we made an even bigger mistake by remarrying. We can turn what seems so right and good now into a living nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Rosie understood what he was saying. \u201cIn other words, if we decide to remarry, that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no going back again. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all or nothing,\u201d he said fervently.</p><p>Rosie didn\u2019t hesitate. She knew what she wanted and that was this man, her husband and lover, back in her life forever. \u201cAll or nothing,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI want it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, will you marry me, Rosie? In sickness and in health, till death do us part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat are we going to tell people?\u201d she asked after a pause.</p><p>Zach chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell them the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe divorce just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful bride.\u201d Grace wiped a tear from the corner of her eye.</p><p>Olivia turned away from the full-length mirror on the back of her bedroom door. She wore a new peach-colored suit, tailored and elegant, and carried a bouquet of pink rosebuds. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace sat on the bed studying her. James and Justine would arrive soon and together they\u2019d escort her to the waterfront park where Jack, his family and Charlotte waited.</p><p>\u201cWill Jack think so?\u201d Olivia asked, knowing how insecure she sounded. After all these years of living as a single woman, she\u2019d never expected to fall in love again, in love to the point that she was willing to share her home and her life with another man. Until Jack Griffin had come along...</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s so touching that Jack asked Pastor Flemming to perform the ceremony,\u201d Grace said, digging for a tissue in the bottom of her purse. \u201cI just know I\u2019m going to ruin everything and cry through the entire thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Olivia assured her, although she wasn\u2019t nearly as confident about herself. Every time she thought of Jack and how much she loved him, she felt like weeping with joy.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Mom!\u201d Justine said, dashing into the bedroom. She brought her hands together in a gesture of reverence. \u201cYou look absolutely gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Olivia blushed, then kissed her daughter on the cheek. \u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Justine asked. \u201cThe limo\u2019s arrived.\u201d</p><p>Olivia looked at Grace, and her best friend threw her a bright smile and a thumb\u2019s-up. Exhaling unsteadily, Olivia whispered, \u201cAs ready as I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames was over at Jack\u2019s place, and he\u2019s a nervous wreck,\u201d Justine informed her as they walked out to the car.</p> <p>\u201cJack?\u201d A few hours earlier, he\u2019d sounded completely under control.</p><p>\u201cEric, Shelly and the boys got here,\u201d Justine went on to explain, \u201cand pandemonium broke out. One of the babies spit up on Jack\u2019s tuxedo. Eric came unglued, but then Shelly calmly cleaned it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everything\u2019s right with the world once more,\u201d Olivia murmured. It\u2019d been crazy at her house, too. Seth had picked up James, Selina and Isabella at the Seattle airport, and within an hour of their arrival, Selina had announced she was pregnant again. That was when the celebrating had begun.</p><p>\u201cYour coach awaits you,\u201d Justine said with a little bow as they reached the sidewalk.</p><p>And she did feel a bit like Cinderella going to the ball. Today marked one of the most significant changes in her life. It was only a matter of weeks since she and Jack had made the decision to marry, but neither was content to delay the wedding. They wanted to be together.</p><p>The liveried driver stood outside the limousine, ready to help everyone inside.</p> <p>\u201cI hope to do something like this for Maryellen and Jon,\u201d Grace said as she stepped into the car with Olivia.</p><p>\u201cHave they set the date yet?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. \u201cThe first Saturday in June.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Olivia said. Weddings seemed to be in the air. Grace\u2019s daughter and Jon Bowman had decided to marry; Olivia knew Grace was both delighted and relieved that Katie\u2019s mother and father would soon be united.</p><p>\u201cAnother Saturday you\u2019ll have to give up your stint at the Humane Society,\u201d Olivia teased, knowing how much Grace enjoyed her volunteer work with the agency.</p><p>Jon and Maryellen\u2019s engagement wasn\u2019t the only news of a wedding that had reached Olivia. The controversial divorce decree she\u2019d made last year, which had caused such a stir at the courthouse, had turned out rather well. She\u2019d heard from Otto Benson, one of the attorneys involved in the case, that the Coxes were planning to remarry. Olivia was pleased, and wished the couple well. Everything at 311 Pelican Court seemed to be in good shape\u2014a refreshing change.</p><p>As the limousine made its way down Lighthouse Road, Olivia looked out the side window at the cove. She loved this beautiful place, this town that was home. She glanced at Grace and smiled. Her friend was adjusting to life as a widow. Maneuvering in unfamiliar territory was never easy; Grace was bound to take a few wrong steps, but Olivia felt confident that all was well at 204 Rosewood Lane, especially now that Grace had found a cause to support. Olivia still hoped Cliff would reappear in Grace\u2019s life, but only time would tell.</p><p>The limo pulled into the parking lot at the waterfront park. The driver rushed around and opened the door for Olivia, then offered her his hand, helping her out.</p> <p>It couldn\u2019t have been a more perfect day for a wedding. A day of bright sun and fresh spring breezes. The sparkling blue water of the cove sent shafts of reflected sunlight toward the gazebo where Jack stood waiting. Roses, lilies, irises and a dozen other flowers filled huge white baskets, carefully arranged to create a border around the white-painted gazebo.</p><p>Her mother was with her friend, Ben Rhodes. Ever since her arrest, Charlotte had been unusually quiet. Olivia was convinced this newfound respect for the law would be short-lived, however. When Charlotte wanted something badly enough, she generally found a way to get it.</p><p>Olivia blamed Ben Rhodes for the fact that she\u2019d had to bail her own mother out of the county jail. She was determined to keep a careful eye on him. Olivia wasn\u2019t sure the elderly gentleman was a good influence on her mother. Nor did she think it was such a good idea for the two of them to be spending so much time together. She intended to learn what she could about Ben Rhodes.</p><p>Jack stepped forward and took Olivia\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I ever did that persuaded you to marry me,\u201d he said as he bent close to kiss her cheek, \u201cbut whatever it was, I can only say I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack, that\u2019s so sweet.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and glanced sheepishly at his best man, Bob Beldon. \u201cBob suggested I say that.\u201d</p><p>Olivia rolled her eyes. She should have known. Jack was no romantic, but he made up for his lack of finesse in a dozen wonderful ways. She was pleased to see Bob and his wife, Peggy. She didn\u2019t know them well, but since Bob was Jack\u2019s best friend, she assumed they\u2019d be seeing more of the couple who owned the local B and B.</p><p>There\u2019d been some concern about Bob, she remembered, something to do with that dead guy. Jack had been rather vague about it, and for a time he\u2019d seemed uncertain whether his friend would be available for the ceremony. Apparently whatever it was had been resolved, although from the barely restrained tension she felt in the other man, Olivia wondered. Things didn\u2019t seem to be quite as they should at 44 Cranberry Point.</p><p>The guests gathered in a close circle around Olivia and Jack. Pastor Flemming opened his Bible and smiled up at the two of them.</p><p>\u201cDearly beloved,\u201d he began.</p><p>Jack squeezed Olivia\u2019s hand, and she returned the gesture. Jack Griffin, newsman and recovering alcoholic, was indeed her beloved, and she was his. Like so many before him, Jack had found new life and purpose in Cedar Cove. She smiled up at this man who would soon be her husband. They were the keepers of each other\u2019s secrets...and of each other\u2019s heart. </p> </body></html>"]
