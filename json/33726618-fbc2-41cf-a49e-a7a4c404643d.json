It\u2019s my absolute favorite color.</p><p>I have a red car, a red coffeepot, have been known to have a red purse on occasion, and there is one accent wall in my living room painted a dark red. This was done both to make me happy when my daughter and I moved into my mother\u2019s old house and to spite my mother. Who hated red. Two birds and all that.</p><p>Certain times of the year, however, the color red gives me the willies.</p> <p>The end of January, for example.</p><p>January\u2014let\u2019s be honest\u2014is a dead month. The hype of the holidays is over and people are back to work, slaving to pay off the credit card bills they just amassed. Resolutions have already been attempted and failed, for the most part, after the first few weeks. All there is, is cold. And wet.</p><p>In Texas, that wet cold is very rarely white. It\u2019s pretty much just gray. In fact, I\u2019ve seen it actually snow\u2014and stick\u2014probably four times in my whole life. One of those times was when my daughter was in the sixth grade, and the whole school district shut down for the three inches we got. Kids were having snowball fights on the playgrounds and the high schoolers had a snowball war on the football field. It made the local news.</p><p>Most of my winters have just been rainy, misty, freezing misery, with the occasional brisk pretty day that fools townspeople into thinking throwing a carnival in the middle of it is a grand idea.</p><p>The Copper Falls Winter Carnival is chaos, themed red in honor of the chili cook-off, and offset in white by the ridiculousness of a fake snowflake parade. That about covers it.</p> <p>They get giddy over this mess. Making floats for a parade that will kick off carnival rides in the icy rain and turn all their papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and Ivory soap creations into paste. Every year.</p><p>Everyone except me. And my Nana Mae, who finds the festival and the whole snow thing in a town right off the Gulf of Mexico as silly as I do. Well, except for the chili part. That part was pretty good, and Georgette Pruitt from the flower shop usually made the best one, if you could ignore the blinged-out snowflake hat she always insisted on wearing.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just that, either. And it wasn\u2019t just the cold rainy ick in the air and people progressively losing their sanity over a lame festival that essentially celebrated nothing. Or from having to watch my otherwise intelligent neighbors self-implode every year debating whether deer meat chili is better than beef or trying to one-up each other with one hundred and one versions of fake snow crafts for their floats. No, I think that\u2019s just extra icing for me.</p><p>I had my own reason for the event to push me sideways every year. The cheesy festival and music and lights and red flyers on every street post, the smell of chili, cookies, and homemade candles, and the weeks preceding it when no one talked about anything else\u2014those were just markers. Big obnoxious signs that hung that reason right out in front of my face.</p><p>And then, even that felt different this year. I felt lopsided.</p><p>I should have taken some time off from the bookstore to read or reorganize or clean out closets for the giant communal garage sale that was also part of the fun. Something brainless that didn\u2019t require thought or hand-eye coordination. I should have, but as usual I didn\u2019t. And my nerves had about had it.</p> <p>This particular morning was not a winner. Like a jolt from a dead sleep at two in the morning. That tends to mess you up a little, overly zealous neighbors or not. I cracked my knuckles and rolled my neck, trying to pull my foggy head together.</p><p>Bam . . . bam . . . bam-bam . . .</p><p>I clenched my teeth as the wall vibrated behind me and elbowed it back sharply in response. Another bam answered, sounding all too much like a cane against the thin walls that separated the bookstore from the diner next door. A cedar cane, in fact. One with a duck head handle. I heard my heartbeat in my ears and took a deep breath to dial it back.</p><p>My wise old Cajun Maw Maw used to say, \u201cHide your crazy, girl. Ain\u2019t nobody wanna see that shit.\u201d</p><p>Maw Maw died of a heart attack at the age of sixty-two. My other grandmother, Nana Mae, who is neither Cajun nor known for being exceptionally wise, is still kicking at eighty-five and says it\u2019s because she lets all her crazy out.</p><p>As I rolled my head back and forth on my shoulders and listened to the snap crackle pop of too much stress, I started thinking that Nana Mae\u2019s way might be the smarter choice. Holding my Southern tongue and smiling through the melodrama of a moody teenager and the daily antics of the old Scrooge next door didn\u2019t seem to be good for longevity. Not to mention people who cared entirely too much about the logistics of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9. Maybe I should let go of a little crazy.</p><p>Bam . . . bam . . .</p><p>\u201cLike\u2014now!\u201d I yelled through my teeth in the direction of the wall.</p> <p>An elderly woman in an unfortunate Pepto-Bismol pink pantsuit glanced up at me with disdain from where she sat in an oversized chair reading a paperback romance novel.</p><p>What, the banging was okay?</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mrs. Chatalain,\u201d I said softly, reaffixing my smile and sucking back my crazy.</p><p>My stomach growled, reminding me that it was lunchtime and that I\u2019d forgotten my leftovers at home. I rubbed at my temples, which had drummed out a dull rhythm since I\u2019d awakened. Something had me on edge. It was always my most difficult time of the year\u2014I expected it. Waited for it. But something was different.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you, today?\u201d said a voice to my left. My assistant manager, Ruthie, strolled from the back of the store looking all bohemian with her black beret cap and her hands tucked in the pockets of a long and well-worn black sweater. Her small frame looked lost in it.</p><p>I shook my head. She\u2019s forgotten, I thought. She doesn\u2019t remember. But that\u2019s okay. Somebody needs to be normal for once.</p><p>\u201cJohnny Mack and his stupid-ass cane,\u201d I said under my breath, nodding toward the offending wall. \u201cThere\u2019s not one note of music playing anywhere in here today.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s his entertainment, Jules,\u201d she said with a wink before something else caught her eye. \u201cUh-oh, look who\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>I followed her gaze to the wall of spray-snow-frosted glass flanking the front of the bookstore, where a lone teenage girl with crooked hair was heading up the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>The bell jingled as she pushed open the door and I watched Mrs. Chatalain raise an eyebrow at the girl\u2019s black smudgy eyeliner, dark shiny hair that was longer on one side than the other, and navy blue T-shirt that said You laugh because I\u2019m different. I laugh because you\u2019re all the same.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the girl said, her mouth cocking in an endearing crooked grin that lit up her face and killed the I-don\u2019t-care mask that she worked so hard to maintain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I said, standing up.</p><p>She frowned and shrugged, the frayed black backpack slung over her shoulders moving with her. \u201cNothing, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you at school?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She pointed to the giant clock across the street that was about to rattle the windows with its eleven o\u2019clock toll.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lunchtime,\u201d she said.</p><p>I closed my eyes and counted the reasons why I loved her as my pen slipped from my fingers and clattered from the counter to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAt school, Bec.\u201d</p><p>Her face scrunched up. \u201cThey had gumbo today,\u201d she said simply. \u201cTheir gumbo sucks. Nothing like Nana Mae\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even mine?\u201d Ruthie said with a head tilt and mock hurt expression.</p><p>Becca smiled. \u201cNot even yours, Aunt Ruthie.\u201d She tilted her head to match. \u201cAlthough I do really like when you make potato salad to put in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Ruthie said with a little curtsy.</p><p>I splayed my fingers wide on the cool granite countertop, letting the hard cold seep in. I probably needed to press my wrists against it. Or go stick my head in the break room freezer. \u201cYou have to quit doing this, Bec. It\u2019s not an open campus. I\u2019m tired of calling\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I get it,\u201d she said, holding her palms up. I noticed there was something new drawn in black Sharpie inside her left wrist. Of course there was. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe law doesn\u2019t care, baby.\u201d</p><p>She widened her eyes at Ruthie in the eternal oh-my-god-ness of it all. \u201cGot it. But I\u2019m here, so do y\u2019all want to take me next door?\u201d</p><p>Her face broke into a cheesy innocent grin that was so fake, it broke me. Ruthie snickered at my side as I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cGirly, you really ought to be my blood. You\u2019ve been around me too long,\u201d she said, walking around to hook an arm around Becca\u2019s neck.</p><p>That was true. Ruthie had been Becca\u2019s \u201caunt\u201d since birth, and my best friend since kindergarten. She\u2019d been with me through everything. Everything. And helping in the bookstore right alongside me since we were eight years old and my mother ran it.</p><p>\u201cI do like your hair, I have to say,\u201d Ruthie said, fingering the lengths that were razor cut from just under her chin on one side to past her shoulder on the other. \u201cWasn\u2019t sold when your mom told me about it, but it works for you.\u201d</p><p>Bec\u2019s smile was brilliant and she fluttered her eyes at me. \u201cThanks!\u201d</p><p>I smiled, humoring them both. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go to the bathroom first,\u201d Bec said, dropping her backpack where she stood. \u201cTheirs is kinda\u2014ick.\u201d</p><p>I sighed as I stooped to pick up her bag. \u201cWhy don\u2019t y\u2019all just go and bring me back something?\u201d I asked Ruthie, gesturing toward our lone customer.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll stay,\u201d she said, plopping onto the stool and grinning at me. \u201cI brought chicken salad.\u201d Laughing at my expression, which I\u2019m sure showed I\u2019d rather be flogged, she continued, \u201cGo fuss at him.\u201d</p><p>As if on cue, three short bumps reverberated through the wall. I sneered and gave her a knowing look. \u201cNot a good time for that.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhy\u2014oh.\u201d Her expression changed and her eyes got a far-off cast to them as she joined me in my retro journey. \u201cThat\u2019s right. No wonder you\u2019ve been funky this week.\u201d She sent a glare toward the wall. \u201cHe probably doesn\u2019t even know anymore.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips. \u201cHe knows. He always gets a little extra asinine right after New Year\u2019s.\u201d I looked away and reached behind the counter for my not-red purse. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll dump my food on his head or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, if you feel the urge, text me first,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll run over there for that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and shook off an involuntary shiver at the same time. Ruthie narrowed her eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I knew what she meant. Ruthie could read me like a damn psychic. She knew me too well.</p><p>\u201cSomething else is going on.\u201d Her dark eyes narrowed to slits in her pale face. \u201cYou look all twitchy.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m not twitchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re twitchy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnowflakes,\u201d I said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a snowflake twitch. I know the snowflake twitch.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a breath and glared at her, not that it had one iota of effect on her. Ruthie was impervious to my attempts at badassery.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I said, looking away. \u201cJust had a bad night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have sushi again?\u201d Ruthie asked.</p><p>I chuckled as I ran a hand through my hair, holding it back. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, glancing toward where Becca had disappeared. \u201cI just\u2014I had a hell of a time falling asleep, and then when I did\u2014I dreamed about Noah.\u201d Her eyes widened just a little, then she crossed her arms as she set a smile right back on her face that made me laugh to myself. \u201cNice cover, Ruthie, don\u2019t play poker.\u201d</p><p>She ignored my snarky remark. \u201cSo, like, \u2018Hey, look at me, I\u2019m Noah, I\u2019m an asshole just walking by\u2019 kind of dream, or like\u2014dream?\u201d she said.</p><p>I picked up my pen, dropped it again, and squatted to grab on to it with both hands. \u201cNot that kind of dream,\u201d I said, mimicking her drama voice. \u201cIt was just one of those\u2014\u201d My face suddenly felt itchy and I rubbed at it. \u201cIt was probably just because it\u2019s coming up. My brain trying to make it harder than it already is.\u201d</p><p>I pasted a smile on as Becca strolled up like a queen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cReady now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m hungry, let\u2019s go,\u201d Bec said.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cOh, yes, let\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat up Johnny Mack!\u201d Ruthie called out, smiling back at Mrs. Chatalain and grabbing some mailers I needed to address and send out.</p><p>Bec\u2019s new hair swung in front of me as we walked outside in the breeze. To her credit, she could pull it off. To her detriment, I saw her dad\u2019s truck parked outside the diner and knew instinctively there would be drama.</p><p>I was actually a little intrigued that Hayden would be there, since Johnny Mack Ryan wasn\u2019t on his favorite list either and I knew he wouldn\u2019t go to his diner on purpose. The old man\u2019s hatred for me spewed over onto everything, and my marrying Hayden three years after Johnny Mack\u2019s son joined the Navy and swore never to return\u2014well, let\u2019s just say that expanded the toxicity to him by association.</p><p>To my daughter, too, but that had different roots.</p><p>The aroma reached me before we ever opened the thick wooden door and my mouth was watering by the time we made it two steps in. I wished the smells came over to my side of the wall as often as the phantom music came to his.</p><p>The clock tower in the old courthouse across the street vibrated the tile under my feet with its announcement. The diner was still only half full, it only being eleven. The tide of office workers from the courthouse wouldn\u2019t hit till noon, and the contractors perpetually working construction down at the river would roll in around a quarter to one. Then it all started up again for dinnertime at five. Johnny Mack did a booming business, in spite of his sour disposition. With his daughter, Linny, at his side keeping customers happy and laughing and spending money on his amazing dishes, people tended to overlook the snarls and sneers and griping from the chef.</p><p>Well, people except me. I had a little more trouble blowing him off. Maybe because his vitriol toward me wasn\u2019t just the snark of an old man. Because he used to love me like a daughter. Because it was personal.</p><p>Linny winked at us as we walked past the counter and Becca patted the surface loudly as she passed. \u201cHey, Mr. Ryan,\u201d she called out.</p><p>I saw him shake his head, not even looking up from the food he was preparing as he grumbled something to himself.</p><p>\u201cGot shrimp today?\u201d she continued, and I had to smile in spite of myself. She didn\u2019t care that he didn\u2019t like her. She didn\u2019t even know why. She just enjoyed the hell out of goading him.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat or move on,\u201d he said, his gravelly voice monotone and lacking the bite it usually had. \u201cMind your manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, her manners are just fine,\u201d Linny tossed back over her shoulder at him. \u201cShe just knows ornery when she sees it.\u201d She shook her head and rolled her eyes at me knowingly. \u201cDid you have a call-in, hon?\u201d</p><p>That would have been a grand idea. \u201cNo, we\u2019re\u2014\u201d I gestured toward some empty tables. \u201cSitting.\u201d I was most definitely not interested in landing at the counter and getting scowled at. I looked for one by the windows but those were all occupied.</p><p>I saw Hayden at one, head bent over a stack of paper with a pretty woman in a suit. A working lunch. Or maybe the prelude to something else? He didn\u2019t see us, so I didn\u2019t do any jumping up and down to call attention.</p><p>\u201cThis is good,\u201d Becca said, picking a four-seater and dumping her backpack in an extra chair.</p><p>Closer to Johnny Mack than I liked, but then again, I needed to get over it. Normally I was able to mostly ignore him. It had been twenty-six years. Over two decades, living in the same town, working next door to each other, and putting up with his temper tantrums. I didn\u2019t normally feel such a strong urge to get away. Maybe it was the dream, still messing with me; maybe I was being hormonal. Whatever it was, it had the little hairs on the back of my neck going stiff.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d I muttered, rubbing at my neck and my arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Becca said, looking up from the plastic menu.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNothing, baby. I\u2019m just wiggy today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wiggy every day,\u201d she said, perusing her choices like it was her last meal. \u201cLast time I got the fried shrimp po\u2019boy sandwich and it was to die for.\u201d</p><p>I plucked a menu from its resting place between the napkin holder and the condiments, not really needing it but looking anyway. I sighed at the red napkins in the holder next to the salt and pepper shakers. Linny already had it going on. Ruthie would be redding up the store soon, too. Frosted glass wasn\u2019t going to satisfy her. \u201cI usually get the plate lunch. I think today is open-faced turkey with mashed potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way he makes it,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you hated him.\u201d She said the sentence in a completely disinterested tone, as if she were talking about the sky being blue.</p><p>I looked up at her. \u201cI don\u2019t hate him. We just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t see eye to eye,\u201d she said, nodding, looking bored. \u201cI know. Can we get dessert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo dessert with lunch, Bec, you know that,\u201d I said. \u201cThat fried shrimp you\u2019re having is bad enough, you\u2019ll never stay awake through class.\u201d</p><p>She was blowing out a sound of disgust before I even finished the sentence.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said. \u201cHave some yogurt tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYogurt,\u201d she muttered. \u201cCan we have real ice cream for once?\u201d</p><p>I let it go. She was in a mood, and nothing I was going to say would make her happy, so I decided to keep the peace. Let her dad over there duke out every single battle. I chose mine. It was better for my sanity.</p><p>She bit her bottom lip for a second and closed her menu, which caught my attention.</p><p>\u201cSomething the matter, Bec?\u201d I asked, closing mine too.</p><p>I could see the gears working. There was a question percolating somewhere. She wanted something, or needed something, or had a world-shattering revelation to tell me. I didn\u2019t like those.</p><p>\u201cHey, ladies.\u201d</p><p>I turned at the familiar voice and fought the mixture of joy and annoyance. Especially when I saw Becca roll her darkly lined eyes. So much for an almost-moment.</p><p>\u201cHi, Patrick,\u201d I said, patting the hand he\u2019d rested on my shoulder. Possessively, I thought. I patted it again to give him the hint to let go. My skin was jumpy enough without someone holding me down. \u201cI thought you were working that site in Torrence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s delayed a few days, for permits and shit.\u201d He stopped short and glanced at Becca, touching her shoulder. \u201cSorry\u2014stuff.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up at him hulking over our table, looking hot in a scruffy motorcycle gang kind of way, and smiled tolerance before widening her eyes back to the menu she\u2019d reopened. She\u2019d met Patrick twice before. Once at the bookstore, where he was so painfully out of place he practically glowed. And then one awkward moment at our house, when Becca came home early from a night out with friends and we were walking down the stairs looking like we\u2019d forgotten how to dress ourselves.</p><p>I nodded, and I couldn\u2019t help darting a glance over to Hayden\u2019s table, hoping he hadn\u2019t caught sight of us. Not that he cared, since we\u2019d been divorced for almost seven years, but he was one to make comments that weren\u2019t supposed to mean anything and yet usually left marks. He was still deep in conversation with the woman over whatever was on the papers.</p><p>\u201cSo, maybe we can grab a bite to eat or something tonight?\u201d he said, squeezing my shoulder again. \u201cOr tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I knew exactly what that \u201cor something\u201d was, and as I let my memory travel the planes of his body built from years of site construction labor, my stomach tingled.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s not good,\u201d Becca said, replacing the menu. \u201cI have a test to study for. I\u2019ll see if I can find something to do to be scarce tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Even smooth-talking Patrick looked lost for words, and I felt the heat whoosh up to the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cY\u2019all have a good lunch.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her as he grabbed a to-go bag and bolted out of the diner.</p><p>\u201cBecca, that was\u2014\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cAwkward?\u201d she finished, nodding with a sarcastic smile. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed at my face, wondering if I just needed to go home for the day. \u201cWhat happened to doing nothing? And since when do you study for anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince maybe I want to watch TV without hearing my mom bang Mr. Hardbody down the hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecca!\u201d</p><p>It was loud. It was too loud, and drew the eyes of everyone in the place, including Hayden\u2019s. But never in my life had I been so mortified.</p><p>\u201cSorry, just sayin\u2019,\u201d she said, at least having the decency to color up, herself.</p><p>\u201cSweethearts, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Linny said then, appearing at our table with a smile and a wink and a significant girth pushing at her apron. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d she added in a quieter voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d I said, maintaining the glare at my daughter. \u201cBecca just forgot her mouth for a second.\u201d</p><p>Becca\u2019s eyes landed everywhere but on me, and then she smiled up at Linny. \u201cI want a Coke with lots of ice, and the shrimp po\u2019boy. With fries,\u201d she added, not looking my way.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Linny said, not writing a thing down, just winking at her. She looked at me. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the plate lunch. And hey, Linny?\u201d I added, as she nodded and started to walk away. \u201cPlease tell your dad to quit banging on the wall. I swear to you on all that is holy that there is no music playing over there,\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>Linny laughed and wiped her hands on her apron. \u201cI\u2019ve told him again and again that I don\u2019t hear anything, but he ignores me.\u201d She nudged me with a finger. \u201cBut check him out today. He\u2019s almost giddy.\u201d</p><p>We both turned to see Johnny Mack grinning at a customer, and the feeling I\u2019d had at two that morning settled over me like a chilled blanket, making me shiver again.</p><p>Why was he happy? And why did that make me feel like a caged animal? I had a bad feeling that this particular crazy was going to have to be held close to the vest. Maw Maw was right. No one was going to want to see this shit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Johnny Mack beamed. And if I\u2019d learned anything in the twenty-plus years since his son left town, that was reason to put your guard up. He was conversing up a customer, his normal look of disgust replaced by\u2014was that interest?</p><p>\u201cI mean, he\u2019s still a grouch, but he\u2019s actually been nice to people today,\u201d Linny said.</p><p>I tried to shake off the heaviness I felt on my skin. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with that?\u201d I asked, frowning.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNo clue. He just keeps saying to watch the door. I don\u2019t know what the hell the door\u2019s gonna do, but if it makes him smile, I\u2019m game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going, Linny?\u201d came a voice to my right, yanking me back to the real world. Becca\u2019s whole face crumpled.</p><p>While Hayden pulled up a chair I looked around for the pretty suited lady, and she was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cAnother day in paradise,\u201d Linny said, winking at him.</p><p>\u201cYou putting your chili in the contest again?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know it\u2019s always my favorite.\u201d</p><p>Linny\u2019s cheeks flushed up as she chuckled and walked away. Hayden had that way. He could make women stutter-stupid with just a smile. Not like he was some hot GQ type or anything. He wasn\u2019t. He dressed it, but always a little messy, like maybe he needed a little help with that tie. With that shirt. With that belt. He wasn\u2019t really a guy to lust over at first glance, but he could have you with a five-minute conversation. I think he\u2019d had me twenty-three years earlier with a \u201chello\u201d and a slow dance. But then, as Becca had so fluently pointed out, I was evidently an easy bang.</p> <p>\u201cBy all means, join us,\u201d I said sarcastically as I leaned on the table and forced that thought away. I suddenly felt as if the day was hell-bent on wearing me out.</p><p>\u201cHey, bug,\u201d he said, ignoring my zinger and focusing on Becca.</p><p>\u201cHey back,\u201d she said, smiling her crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014did the hairdresser have to leave midway for a family emergency or something?\u201d</p><p>Her smile faltered, and I wanted to throw sugar substitute packets at him.</p><p>\u201cYep, she did,\u201d Becca said, meeting his gaze. \u201cSo we only paid for one side.\u201d</p> <p>Hayden nodded, I guess for once seeing that it wasn\u2019t worth the fight. \u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with it?\u201d he asked, turning to me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not eight, Hayden. She\u2019s a high school senior.\u201d I took a deep swallow from my water glass. \u201cIf having weird hair\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>I ignored her indignation. \u201c\u2014is her worst sin, then I think we can count our blessings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I get my tattoo,\u201d Becca said, which managed to render both Hayden and me speechless for a second.</p><p>\u201cCome again?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhen I graduate,\u201d she said matter-of-factly, holding up her Sharpie\u2019d wrist. \u201cSomething here, don\u2019t know what, yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust nod, Hayden,\u201d I said on a sigh. \u201cIt changes monthly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis one won\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>Linny swung back by with a basket of rolls and extra butter because she knew Becca and I were butter whores. I slathered one up and took a bite, relishing the carbs.</p><p>A hand on my shoulder turned me around. \u201cDid you get the email?\u201d said an elderly man with spinach in his teeth and a comb-over that never moved.</p><p>I blinked. \u201cEmail\u2014um, I haven\u2019t had a chance to check yet today, Mr. Morrison, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went out four days ago,\u201d he said. The spinach didn\u2019t move. \u201cYou are supposed to have your ad and payment turned in for the flyer by this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Of course I did. The all-important festival flyer. Priorities. \u201cOkay, well, I\u2019ll\u2014check in on that.\u201d</p><p>He patted my shoulder, shook Hayden\u2019s hand even though he probably didn\u2019t remember who he was, and then just kind of looked at Becca as he walked past.</p><p>\u201cAm I purple or something?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your aura,\u201d I whispered back, making her snicker. \u201cSo, what brings you to the dark side?\u201d I asked Hayden, nudging him with an elbow.</p><p>\u201cI was at the courthouse with a contract, so I figured what the hell. Hey, you know the old man didn\u2019t even give me a dirty look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinny said he\u2019s all happy for some reason,\u201d Becca said around her own bite of gooey roll.</p><p>\u201cSo who was the fancy woman?\u201d I asked, unable to resist the jab and needing to distract myself from Johnny Mack\u2019s issues. \u201cDating lawyers now?\u201d I asked with a grin.</p><p>Hayden turned to meet me dead-on, his hazel eyes twinkling. \u201cWho was the crustacean? Dating bikers now?\u201d</p><p>A full-on belly laugh started low and worked its way up, making me realize just how much I\u2019d missed laughing like that. In spite of our differences, Hayden could always make me laugh. And this particular time of year, with the damp cold creeping in and the crispness in the mornings making the sad in me rise to the surface, I needed to feel that release.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>I raised the roll to my lips and the remaining chuckle froze in my throat as the door opened and in walked a couple. The small brunette woman was all in red and beautiful enough to make anyone notice, but it was the man.</p><p>A man I\u2019d last seen as a seventeen-year-old boy. Unless you counted last night\u2019s dream. My skin went cold and tingly and my head felt like I\u2019d been sucking helium. I felt the roll leave my fingers.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d I heard Becca say. \u201cMom, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules?\u201d Hayden\u2019s voice said in my ear.</p><p>But it was the eyes that traveled the room, looking nostalgic but wary as they took in every detail until they landed on me and stuck. I felt their weight. And went back to the last time we\u2019d locked eyes.</p><p>The day I gave our baby away.</p><p>\u201cNoah.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Twenty-six years. A lifetime ago. And yet in that moment, with Noah Ryan standing fifteen feet away from me, I was suddenly the seventeen-year-old pregnant senior, holding his hand in the hallway and trying to get through the day. The swollen, hormonal girl at the Copper Falls Halloween picnic, leaving yet another fight with my mom to go meet up with my boyfriend and talk about visions of marriage. The waddling, back-gripping girl at Christmas, and the conflicted young woman at the cursed Winter Carnival, arguing with her fianc\u00e9 by the river, going into labor and rushing to the hospital through tears. And then an empty girl, giving some very lucky couple a beautiful treasure, while the boy she loved left crying. Left town, left the country, left her completely.</p><p>For twenty-six years.</p><p>\u201cThere he is,\u201d sang Johnny Mack from the kitchen in a voice that was more upbeat than I\u2019d heard maybe ever. The old man came around that counter with his duck-headed cane, barely needing it as he held his arms open. \u201cThere\u2019s my boy!\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a boy anymore. Gone was the lanky frame, and in its place was solidity and muscle. His dark hair was cropped short, with a smattering of something lighter. His face was more filled out, as was his whole body. And the black pullover shirt he wore loosely over jeans showed all of it. Dear God, the military had been good to him.</p><p>Johnny Mack Ryan\u2019s face broke into a grin as he embraced Noah, and Linny came running from the restroom.</p><p>\u201cJesus Christ, Noah!\u201d she said, tears in her voice. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d She nearly knocked her father over to get to him, and he laughed as she wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cYou worm! Not telling us you\u2019re coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad knew,\u201d Noah said, and the sound of his voice after all those years sent ripples over my skin. I gripped my napkin like it could keep me together. \u201cHe wanted to surprise you.\u201d</p><p>She let go of Noah and shoved at her dad as he laughed a wheezy laugh I hadn\u2019t heard in decades. \u201cYou\u2014ornery old goat!\u201d</p><p>I realized I was still staring when Noah\u2019s gaze found me again. Something there hit me like a cannonball to the chest, and I forced my eyes back down to the half-eaten roll on my plate, listening to myself breathe. Hayden\u2019s voice reminded me that there were still people at my table.</p><p>\u201cJulianna.\u201d</p><p>He only called me my full name when he wanted to get my full attention, so evidently he\u2019d been talking to me for a while.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I said, a little too loudly, my voice cracking. At the pause, I looked his way.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Under all the turmoil whizzing through my head, I felt his true questions, saw them in his eyes. But I wasn\u2019t going to go there in front of Becca. I just nodded, not trusting my voice with all my insides turned to Jell-O, and then hating myself for acting stupid over a man from two decades in my past.</p><p>I felt Becca\u2019s gaze on me and chose to look past it. I intended to check out the fastest path to the door. I didn\u2019t care about the food, I\u2019d get it from Linny later. I just needed to leave before my nerves got the better of me.</p><p>\u201cDad met Shayna when he came to Italy,\u201d Noah was saying, pulling my eyes back his way. \u201cBut, Linny, I want you to meet her.\u201d He reached back where the stunning woman was standing slightly behind him and gently pulled her forward, his hand on the small of her back. \u201cThis is my sister, Linny, babe.\u201d The woman smiled warmly and extended her hand as Linny\u2019s large ones swallowed it. \u201cLinny, this is my fianc\u00e9e, Shayna.\u201d</p><p>Fianc\u00e9e. My blood burned as the word bounced around. Oh, I was such an infant. Who cared if he was engaged, or married, or shacking up. People ran into old boyfriends and girlfriends all the time. The difference was that usually you saw them living life in the meantime. The last time I saw Noah\u2014I was his fianc\u00e9e.</p><p>I reached into my bag and pulled two twenties blindly from it, handing them to Becca. Knowing it was probably thirty dollars too much and not caring. She could call it a score.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and eat, baby. Visit with your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she said, looking genuinely disappointed and breaking what I could feel of my heart. \u201cWhere are you going? We don\u2019t even have our food yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to um\u2014something\u2019s come up,\u201d I said. \u201cI need to go. You and Daddy have lunch on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, I need to go, actually,\u201d Hayden said.</p><p>\u201cVisit with your daughter,\u201d I said slowly, pinning him with each word. I turned back to Becca, who was looking at me like I was traitorous. \u201cEat your lunch. Box mine up. Drop it by on your way back to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, hang on,\u201d Hayden said, narrowing his eyes at her. \u201cHow are you out of school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good chat,\u201d I said, patting him on the back as I rose from my chair. I kissed Becca on the top of the head. \u201cLoves,\u201d I said into her hair.</p><p>\u201cLoves,\u201d she said, although I didn\u2019t feel love. I felt her hate spewing out all over me.</p><p>Another parental fail moment I\u2019d have to own up to, but it was better than melting down in my chair. Fortunately, I managed to pass the happy couple on my way to the door without tripping on anything.</p><p>\u201cJules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d I said under my breath, turning around. At least I thought it was under my breath. By the expression on his woman\u2019s face, it might not have been. She was even more beautiful up close, I noticed, with no crinkles or zits and perfectly lined eyes. I forced myself to meet his eyes instead. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>And that was a bad idea. He was two feet away. I could see the deep blue of his eyes, smell him. Feel the heat of his body. Okay, maybe not that, maybe that was just my anxiety and rage and anger and hormonal imbalance going ape-shit.</p><p>He opened his mouth to say something, but he looked nearly as floored as I felt. Why was he floored? He at least knew he was coming. He knew he\u2019d see me eventually. I, on the other hand, was just fine with him on the other side of the world, and didn\u2019t realize that gap had closed. Especially not now.</p><p>He swallowed back whatever thought was there, and I didn\u2019t let myself analyze it. Not all these years later when I couldn\u2019t even say I knew him anymore. I just nodded.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, Noah.\u201d</p><p>I was so proud of myself for forming words.</p><p>He just blinked and let himself be pulled back into the chaos as his dad stepped between us and turned his back to me, slapping him on the back as Noah\u2019s fianc\u00e9e slipped a hand into the crook of his arm.</p><p>\u201cEveryone!\u201d Johnny Mack hollered out to the entire diner. His face was transformed from grouch to grin. \u201cMy son is here!\u201d At the murmurs and curious looks from people who didn\u2019t know why that was holler-worthy, he waved his hands impatiently. \u201cFrom Italy! Noah\u2019s home from the Navy. He\u2019s finally home!\u201d</p><p>At the smattering of claps and amused expressions and welcome home\u2019s from the clientele, Noah smiled stiffly and visibly reddened. He still wasn\u2019t one for the spotlight, I noticed, as he backed up a step and put a hand on the back of the brunette\u2019s neck, eyeing the room. I felt the discomfort with him, backing slowly toward the door so my exit wouldn\u2019t be analyzed by any town gossips. As much as I wanted to bolt, I couldn\u2019t quit looking at him. It had been such a long time. Most of the people in there were too young to remember the juicy story or the boy who\u2019d left Copper Falls to be a career Navy man. The few old-timers sitting around the lunch counter got up and shook his hand, as they remembered him and knew what he\u2019d been\u2014what he was. They\u2019d kept up with Johnny Mack\u2019s stories of Noah\u2019s adventures over the years, when he joined Special Forces and when he made master chief.</p><p>\u201cYou here for a visit, Noah, or home for good?\u201d Spinach teeth asked him.</p><p>Noah took his hand in both of his and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m home, Mr. Morrison. I\u2019m getting too old to keep moving around. I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the door open with my back and slipped out, welcoming the brisk breeze on my flushed skin.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s home,\u201d I whispered, echoing the words. I leaned against the scratchy door for a moment, letting the crispness of the air cool me down. I blew out a slow breath, and ignored an odd look from a passing couple. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said to them, smiling, squeezing my own fingers to stem the shaking. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I repeated, softer, to myself. \u201cQuit being a child.\u201d</p><p>I pushed off the door when I heard group laughter inside and started the twenty whole feet to my own door. Ruthie was laughing in her singsongy way as I pulled the door open and the little bell jingled overhead. Mrs. Chatalain was on her way out, a little gold sales bag held against her pukey pink outfit.</p><p>\u201cHave a good day,\u201d I managed, holding the door open for her. \u201cEnjoy your book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of sale you going to have for the Winter\u2014\u201d she began, nodding back toward the inside.</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d I said briskly. \u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy one, get one free would be nice,\u201d she said, squinting up at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it probably won\u2019t be that,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d she muttered, holding her bag against her as if it would block the wind. \u201cYour mother would have done that for an hour or so,\u201d she said. \u201cWith hot chocolate or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d I managed, what my mother would have done or not done being the least of my concerns.</p><p>A couple was at the counter finishing up a large purchase of self-help books when I went in, and the guy was flirting shamelessly with Ruthie as the woman laughed a little uncomfortably. I smiled as they left, swiped a sprinkled cupcake from a platter Ruthie had brought out, and landed in a nearby chair, suddenly spent.</p><p>\u201cAnyone in here?\u201d I asked, resting my head against the back with my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a fast lunch. Becca already headed back?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head and focused on the cupcake, trying to unpeel the paper with fingers that had forgotten how to function.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, the word coming out raspy. I cleared my throat and tried to push his face from my vision.</p><p>\u201cJules? Is everything okay,\u201d I heard Ruthie say.</p><p>I set the cupcake down and closed my eyes, shaking my head just slightly. The air felt thick and quiet around me, the ticking of a nearby clock being the only sound. He was back.</p><p>\u201cJules?\u201d she asked again, her voice coming closer as the curiosity beckoned her.</p><p>With my eyes shut and my other senses heightened, I heard the wariness and concern in her words. I opened my eyes and stared straight ahead, blowing out a breath slowly. A tiny laugh bubbled up my throat that had nothing to do with anything being funny.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah Ryan was my first love. He was my first everything. He was my first boyfriend, daring me to climb to the top of the monkey bars in the second grade and then kissing me square on the mouth when I did. He brought me special rocks he picked out and held my hand in the lunch line.</p><p>In later years, Noah would give me my first beer, first cigarette, and first real kiss during Truth or Dare. He was the first one to break my heart, then steal it again. He was the first boy to ever tell me he loved me, the first one I ever loved back, and the one I gave my first time to. We both did. Fumbling and awkward and passionate in the pouring rain one late April night, driven by young love and raging hormones, we learned what making love was.</p><p>And what making life was.</p><p>He wanted to marry me. In all his teenaged wisdom, he was ready to give up his lifelong dream of being a soldier and just stay there and be a family. My mother said no. My parents were devastated and mortified, of course. All the things you would rightly feel upon finding out your pure-as-the-driven-snow angel has given up the goods and gotten herself knocked up. They had loved Noah up until that point, but all that went out the window. My dad went lunatic crazy, his Cajun blood sending him to angry places he didn\u2019t need to go, but the thought of his baby being violated sent him past reason. It didn\u2019t matter how many times I used the words \u201cconsensual\u201d and \u201cin love\u201d\u2014I never got further than that. As soon as he\u2019d hear the L word, he\u2019d go off wanting to kill the boy that ruined his daughter.</p> <p>That child would have been twenty-one years old when my dad died, and another year older when my mother followed him. In all those years they never spoke of it to me\u2014the grandchild they passed up, arranging for the adoption to happen the second it was born, with the records sealed. Not even nine years later when Hayden and I finally had Becca. It was easier for them that way, I supposed, pretending it never happened. I couldn\u2019t pretend that well. I had the memory of a son I\u2019d never hold, and never know. And the image of Noah\u2019s tortured expression as he let go of my hand to see his son and they wouldn\u2019t let him. The sound of his pleading and the tears soaking his face.</p><p>I lost it for a while as well, but it was too late. The baby was gone. And then so was Noah.</p><p>And now here he was. Back in a town that had mostly forgotten. At a time I\u2019d never forget. Stirring everything up again.</p><p>That was unfair, I thought, to think that. He wasn\u2019t to blame for what his presence stirred up in me. And I wasn\u2019t my parents. I did think about my baby boy on every holiday, every Mother\u2019s Day, and every time I\u2019d see a young man resembling Noah. Every first that Becca had, I\u2019d wonder about his. I wondered about his life, if he was nearby or far away, and if he loved dark chocolate like I did or licorice like Becca. If he had an artist\u2019s hand or a sniper\u2019s eye. But I especially devoted January 29 to him in my heart. His birthday.</p><p>Why would Noah pick now to make his grand entrance? Was he even aware of it? Was summertime not good enough? Or any of the other eleven months?</p> <p>I sat in the dark after Ruthie left for the evening, soaking up the quiet and thinking way too damn much. I knew I needed to go home, but even though it had been mine and Becca\u2019s home for four years since I inherited it, today nothing felt like mine. Like I was going back to my mother\u2019s house to be judged again. The logical part of me knew that was silly, but logic wasn\u2019t playing a big part in my process.</p><p>The bookstore had been hers, too, but it was a business. The house just never felt like ours. I never felt it settle into our skin the way a home should. Growing up there, it had been structured and perfect and run with strict guidelines. Nana Mae always said her neck went stiff every time she walked in that house, and while she said it to be funny I knew what she meant.</p><p>The bookstore was the opposite, and maybe that was my mother\u2019s way of releasing all her pent-up creativity. It was magical there. Free and flowing and musical. She always had delicious smelling candles burning, something baking in the back kitchen to put out for customers, and happy music playing. She\u2019d leave the counter to go read a storybook to a child if they looked interested in one. She talked to customers and within minutes knew exactly the book they would like or needed. She was Miss Mary Dee to the world of Copper Falls. The store breathed through her, and I used to love to watch her work. My friends were always envious of me for having such an amazing mom. But they didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>Miss Mary Dee was left at the store each night, and the mother I knew at home was someone else entirely. It was like she exhausted all her creativeness during the day and only had the rules of life left in her once she got home.</p><p>I pushed to my feet from the reading sofa in the corner, shelving a book someone had left out. The store still wove its spell on me every time I entered, but I didn\u2019t have her touch. I tried to keep customers happy, but I couldn\u2019t read them the way she did. There was still an oven in the back, but fresh cookies and cupcakes and other goodies were only made when Ruthie would find the time or make them at home and bring them in. And while Ruthie would light candles, I\u2019d end up following behind her and blowing them out for fear we\u2019d forget one and the whole place would burn to the ground.</p><p>And music? I snorted just thinking about it. Johnny Mack made sure we didn\u2019t have that. I didn\u2019t remember him banging on the wall when she played her soft jazz tunes back then, but he definitely didn\u2019t like it now.</p> <p>I made another round through the back office area, snatched my jacket and bag from behind the mammoth old wooden checkout counter that I\u2019d added a granite top to, and let myself out, locking the door behind me.</p><p>I had to pass the diner on the way to my car, but before I headed there, I couldn\u2019t help a sideways glance inside. It was dark behind the little white stringed lights Linny had painstakingly trimmed out the window with. There was no one in there. I breathed a tiny sigh of relief, mixed with the dread I felt as I let my eyes drift toward the big gazebo that was located catty-corner from the diner. In a couple of weeks the gazebo and the whole park behind it would be blinged out in all manner of white and red, smelling of fried carnival food and all kinds of chili. But for now it was still green and serene. In general, I didn\u2019t have much reason to hang out down there anymore. The river was nice, and I\u2019d bring Becca down there to feed the ducks when she was little, but it was tied to a moment that clamped down on my heart. I had a version of it on canvas in my living room, and that was all I needed. I only went in person once a year, and it wasn\u2019t that day yet.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I wrapped my jacket around me and crossed the street. The dusky dark had the streetlights flickering on, and the ice cream shop down the block was still lit up brightly, serving hot chocolate and spiced tea.</p><p>I felt conspicuous as I passed the gazebo and reached the path that would lead to the river, as if everyone in town were watching me. As if no one had anything better to do than wait all year for me to go to the park.</p><p>The river wound into view among big beautiful cypress trees, and as I moved toward the bench I always inhabited, I stopped short, my steps faltering. There, sitting in the dim light, lit only by the low security lights along the water, was Noah. Sitting alone, looking down at something in his hands, he didn\u2019t see me.</p><p>He remembered.</p><p>Every centimeter of skin on my body tingled as the emotion welled up in my throat and burned behind my eyes. It was the last place where our baby had still been ours.</p><p>I closed my eyes and could smell the cold rain of that late afternoon, hear the music filtering over from the carnival rides. Noah and I sat on that bench and didn\u2019t care that the sky was leaking on us. We\u2019d made that life in a storm, and then we were arguing about whether to keep it in the middle of another one.</p> <p>\u201cPlease, Jules,\u201d he said, leaning over to lay his face on my stomach. I could feel the heat of his skin through my shirt. \u201cGive us a chance. Don\u2019t let your parents do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at us,\u201d I said, lifting his head and raking his rain-soaked hair from his face. \u201cWe\u2019re a mess, Noah. We live at home, we have maybe forty dollars between us, and we have to ride to school with your sister. We can\u2019t even pass algebra. What kind of parents can we be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnes that love each other,\u201d he said back, heat in his voice and his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019ll go to hell and back to be a family. I promised you I\u2019d take care of us and I will, Jules. Fuck algebra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHow are we going to pay for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your mother talking,\u201d Noah said, jumping to his feet and pacing. \u201cThat\u2019s that place they sent you to. It\u2019s not you.\u201d He dropped to his knees again in front of me. \u201cWhere are you, Jules?\u201d</p><p>I blinked against the rain in my eyes and instinctively palmed my belly as the baby did a somersault. \u201cI\u2019m right here,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He shook his head and took my hands in his. \u201cNo, you aren\u2019t. You haven\u2019t been for a while. She\u2019s got your head so filled with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith things that make sense,\u201d I shot back. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see that place, Noah. The girls my age that looked thirty, just trying to get through the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re alone, you\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want this too, Noah,\u201d I said, my voice cracking. \u201cI\u2019d give anything. I live with it every day, feel it every day. This baby is depending on me right now and I\u2019m scared to death. All I have to do is eat to make it happy, and still I\u2019m scared to death.\u201d I placed his hands on the squirming movement of my belly. \u201cFeel that?\u201d</p><p>His eyes filled with liquid that had nothing to do with the rain. \u201cYes,\u201d he choked.</p><p>\u201cHow do we take care of that?\u201d</p><p>He reversed our hands so that mine were back underneath. \u201cFeel that?\u201d he said, fat tears falling from his eyes. I couldn\u2019t breathe. \u201cHow do we walk away from that?\u201d</p><p>I opened my eyes to realize there were hot tears rolling down my face. That was the last time our baby had been ours. Two minutes later, my water broke, and I went into labor, setting off a comedy of errors to get to the hospital. And said good-bye to everything.</p><p>How do we walk away from that? Those words had haunted me ever since.</p><p>I swallowed hard, blinking my tears free to see his profile, and turned around. I walked as quietly as I could back up the path, thanking God I wasn\u2019t wearing heels to clack on the sidewalk.</p><p>Was he remembering that same night? Was he thinking about us? Of course not, I chided myself, wiping my eyes. He was back here with a gorgeous girlfriend and plans for the rest of his life. He wasn\u2019t concerned with the nostalgia of an old flame. That look on his face earlier had been totally natural. We both were a little taken aback for a second at seeing each other again for the first time, that\u2019s all. Had he stayed in town, we\u2019d have become dulled to the other\u2019s presence after a while, as all breakups go. We never got the chance to dull. So now\u2014twenty-six years later\u2014we\u2019d have to awkwardly do that.</p><p>My cell buzzed as I got to my car, and I checked to see a text from Becca.</p><p>Out 2 eat wth Lizzy &amp; Darlene. Spnding nite with L.</p><p>I leaned against my car and steadied my breathing, still feeling the burn behind my ribs. Why was he back? Why couldn\u2019t he just stay gone?</p><p>I cleared my throat and shook the thoughts free. I had other issues. It\u2019s a school night, I texted back, in full words, rebelling against the text-speak. I remembered her troubled expression from earlier and felt a stab of concern and curiosity. And wondered what she was really up to. I remembered seventeen. Way too well.</p><p>They go 2 school 2, was her reply. Quizg 4 the govmt test. L mom said ok.</p><p>Quizzing, my ass. She\u2019d forgotten she\u2019d already copped to that. But too tired to pick that particular battle, and remembering I\u2019d dumped her at lunch with her dad, and knowing Lizzy\u2019s mom was somewhat of a Nazi June Cleaver in workout clothes, stricter on Lizzy than I could ever be accused of, and would probably feed her a four-course breakfast in the morning and personally supervise homework, I broke my own rule and gave in.</p><p>Loves, I texted. Our trademark word since she was little.</p><p>Loves :).</p><p>I got in, fixed my eyes, got my shaky nerves under control.</p><p>And called Patrick.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Patrick was a guilty pleasure, unlike anything I\u2019d ever done before. Never in my life had I had a one-night stand. I\u2019d gone from Noah to a rotation of random losers to Hayden. After my divorce I went solo for a very long time. Deciding that I was clearly not cut out for relationships, I focused on being Becca\u2019s mom. Once I did start dating, it was small-time. Only one ever got close to being serious, and when it did, I doused it. I wasn\u2019t looking for another husband, or even a significant other. So when Patrick sidled into my world with his no-strings-attached, let\u2019s-just-have-fun sexual whirlwind, I was ripe for the picking. And he was fun.</p><p>Fun.</p><p>Like taking off on a motorcycle and feeling the wind whip by at eighty miles an hour, just to stop and eat pizza and have sex in a field kind of fun. Okay, we really only did that once, but it was so outside my box that I\u2019d never forget it. Ever.</p><p>We didn\u2019t talk about our personal lives, other than the obvious surface things like he knew about Becca and he knew I owned a bookstore. I knew he had no kids and headed up a construction crew.</p><p>That about summed up what we needed to know to make small talk during rest periods. Because we didn\u2019t hook up for the stimulating conversation.</p><p>I crawled back in bed, propping up on an elbow so I could stare at him. The new morning light peeking through the curtain was just enough to highlight all I needed to see. One arm was thrown over his head and his face was relaxed in sleep. He\u2019d shaved for me because he knew I couldn\u2019t stand the scratchiness, but the darkness was working its way back onto his jaw.</p><p>Patrick exuded raw sex appeal. Anyone could say anything they wanted about his crude language and rough exterior, he was hot. And was a product of the life he chose. Construction guys don\u2019t worry about what wine goes with what entr\u00e9e, they are just happy that there\u2019s wine. And they don\u2019t call it an entr\u00e9e.</p><p>The sheet was tangled around him, a leftover result of the monkey sex we\u2019d had around two. I traced a finger down his chest, in awe as usual of the muscle definition that continued into his abs. He was my age, roughly, or so I assumed. That was another thing we\u2019d never actually defined, but although his body didn\u2019t look it, I felt like he was in his mid-forties.</p><p>He drew in a deep breath as the touch stirred him from sleep, and he opened his eyes slowly and blinked at me.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, yourself.\u201d</p><p>He wound a finger around one of my locks and pulled me to him for a kiss. I dropped a light one on his lips and he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already brushed your teeth, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I snickered. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, eyes drifting back closed with a lazy smile. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant some coffee?\u201d I asked. \u201cI just made some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just yet,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go see if I can hit this dream up again.\u201d I ran my lips lightly along his arm and then moved to his stomach, kissing the parts the sheet didn\u2019t cover. \u201cMmm, but if you keep doing that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not much till you make me go brush my teeth.\u201d</p><p>I gave his stomach a nip and laughed as I pushed off the bed. I was restless. I\u2019d already had two cups of coffee and showered, and aside from being naked was nearly done getting ready for work. Two hours earlier than necessary. It was like my skin couldn\u2019t be still.</p><p>I eyed Patrick\u2019s flannel shirt where it lay over my chair in the corner and opted for my big floppy warm robe instead. As sexy as wearing a man\u2019s shirt felt, that struck an intimate chord with me that I wasn\u2019t interested in pursuing. I took the stairs softly, stepping around the creaky spots out of habit. Hearing the familiar ka-thump, I turned to see Harley, our pit bull, exit from Becca\u2019s room. The giant brindle-coated teddy bear slept in Becca\u2019s bed every night whether she was there or not. Although she could put on quite the guilt trip when she felt like the girl abandoned her.</p><p>\u201cHey, Harley-bear,\u201d I whispered, scrubbing her neck. She looked up at me with a doggie grin that warmed me like nothing else could. \u201cWanna go get some coffee with me?\u201d</p><p>I ran a finger along the bottom of three framed photos on the way down. One of Becca, Mom and me right after Dad died. Another one held Becca\u2019s school picture. And the last one was of me and my parents when I was around ten, with my weenie dog Duchess in my lap. It was there on the wall my whole life, was still there when I moved in, and was one of the few things I couldn\u2019t discard when I redecorated. Duchess was buried in the backyard, under a Texas-shaped pavestone in the flower bed.</p><p>I opened the back door for Harley, poured myself another cup of coffee and turned the machine off so I\u2019d quit, and then just\u2014stood there\u2014soaking in everything. The countertops were granite now instead of the original Formica. The blue-and-white-checked linoleum floors and shag carpet had been sacrificed for natural stone tile. While I\u2019d changed everything I could afford to change and replaced the old furniture with our own, it was still my mother\u2019s house in many ways. I\u2019d even arranged the furniture differently so it wouldn\u2019t feel the same, but it still came down to the same old shell with the same old ailments it always had. Creaky stairs. Noisy plumbing. And too many memories in the bookshelves.</p><p>That was another thing that hadn\u2019t changed much. In my mother\u2019s will, after leaving me her house, she\u2019d requested that her books remain in the wall-to-wall bookshelves that stretched across the living room. By \u201cremain\u201d I took that to mean anywhere on those shelves, so I\u2019d taken out all the knickknacks and shoved them all together on one side so that my books would fit. I thought it was fair. I mean, what a bizarre request.</p><p>Regardless, I complied, just like I always had. Feeling the jolt of memories that came attached to each and every book I touched. Each one had a story behind the story. And sometimes it was better that those stories stay right where they were rather than pull all my crap to the surface. I figured there would be time enough to deal with all that if I ever decided to remodel or sell. In four years it hadn\u2019t been a priority.</p><p>At the familiar scratch on the back door, I let Harley in and sank into the couch, curling my legs under me and pulling pillows onto my lap. She jumped up as if she were a little lap dog, the couch sinking where she planted herself, squirming half onto the pillows on her back. I chuckled as I rubbed her belly and all her taut muscles melted into mush, legs sprawled and head thrown back. Harley didn\u2019t know about her breed\u2019s reputation. Nobody told her she was supposed to be fierce. She thought she was born for belly rubs and bacon treats.</p><p>The room was dim except for the early light streaming from behind the curtains at the front window. It was quiet. Too quiet. It was odd, not having Becca there making noise and griping about what clothes she couldn\u2019t find or homework she\u2019d forgotten to do. I was used to the chaos, and the lack of it had my ears ringing and my thoughts working way too fast.</p><p>A light knock at my door cut them off, and I set my mug on a nearby side table as I checked the wooden clock sitting on it. Seven thirty-five.</p><p>Harley contorted herself back upright and her ears went on alert.</p><p>\u201cWhat, did you forget something, Bec?\u201d I said under my breath. \u201cLike your key?\u201d</p><p>I got up shaking my head, the responsibility lecture already booting up in my head. Assuming it to be Becca, I opened the door unchecked, grateful I hadn\u2019t opted for Patrick\u2019s shirt. And felt every pore in my skin wake up. That last swallow of coffee sat in my stomach like mud.</p><p>Noah stood before me with tired eyes, hands crammed into the pockets of a black leather bomber jacket. His gaze took me in quickly, but I had the feeling he could have passed a test on what he\u2019d filed away in that two seconds.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Morning? Really? I opened my mouth to say something back, but nothing came out, so I licked my lips and fidgeted with my robe like a crazy woman.</p><p>\u201cToo early?\u201d he asked, as if that were a normal thing to say to me as well.</p><p>A laugh-scoff-snort thing fell out of my mouth, which I chalked up to rounding out the perfect start to the day. I coughed and cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m\u2014just getting ready for work.\u201d I stepped back so he could come in and held on to the door for dear life as I glared at Harley for just sitting there on the couch like a diva. Some guard dog. She should have had his leg chewed off by now. \u201cCome in. There\u2019s still coffee if you want some.\u201d Oh, what the living hell was I babbling about?</p> <p>Noah stepped in hesitantly, as if maybe he hadn\u2019t thought things out that far. Maybe he expected me to slam the door or not be home or God only knows what. He gave me a sideways glance as he passed me, and I caught a subtle whiff of soap and shaving cream. I stared at the door as I closed it, as if it had betrayed me too, and then I turned on my heel and put myself in motion.</p><p>I walked straight past him to the open kitchen, trying not to really look at him. I knew he\u2019d follow. He knew the way around my mother\u2019s house. My house.</p><p>Harley\u2019s curiosity finally got the better of her and she followed on his heels, making him turn around to check out the beast stalking him.</p><p>\u201cHey there, killer,\u201d he said, holding out a hand for her to smell him, and then scratching her ears. \u201cAre you nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Harley,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid growing up with two women has made her a big wuss.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cCoffee?\u201d I asked again, opening a cabinet.</p> <p>When he didn\u2019t answer, I turned around, and felt my heart slam against my chest. He was standing on the other side of the big island from me, where I\u2019d seen him so many times before. Except he was a man now. With something in his eyes that resembled lost.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, though not much of the word came out.</p><p>Noah shook his head and his expression cleared a little. \u201cJust weird being back here, I guess. In this kitchen.\u201d He gestured with a small hand flick. \u201cSeeing you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I said softly, turning back to grab a mug whether he wanted one or not.</p><p>\u201cLinny told me you were living here again,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry to hear about your mom.\u201d</p><p>My hands shook as I poured the hot black liquid and turned to set his mug on the counter.</p> <p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I managed to push out. \u201cSugar and creamer are right there,\u201d I said with a gesture.</p><p>\u201cBlack\u2019s fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>I nodded and headed into the living room for my cup. Shit, Jules, breathe. I planned to come back, but he followed me. Shit. The kitchen felt more stable. We could stand up in there. Have the island between us. The living room was cozy and said please sit and stay a while. Granted, I did have to go to work\u2014in an hour and a half. Shit.</p><p>I licked my lips again and sat back down where I was earlier. Feet curled beneath me. Two pillows on my lap for security. I felt every centimeter of my nakedness under the robe and wished for more clothing, but it was big enough for him not to know that. I just thanked God for giving me the wisdom to get ready early and not be sitting here with wet hair or raccoon eyes. And then I mentally kicked myself for caring. He didn\u2019t. I wondered if his woman knew he was paying me a visit. Or if she even knew who I was.</p><p>Noah took his time in the room, his eyes not missing a thing. That was different. The old Noah was open and carefree. This one was wary and overtly observant, taking in the changes as well as the familiar. I saw him take note of the photos of Becca on nearly every surface. Of the abstract art on the walls, and then stop in front of one that I wished he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>He had matured into an amazing-looking man, I noticed, not wanting to. Everything about his body was solid and powerful, like he took root wherever he stood. He looked comfortable in his own skin, like he could rock a tux as easily as the jeans and soft leather jacket and boots he currently had on. Not that I was picturing that at all.</p><p>\u201cThese are yours,\u201d he said without turning.</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, still staring at the canvas. \u201cI can tell. Do you sell them?\u201d he asked, turning his head.</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cNo. Gave some away, but I\u2019ve never tried to sell anything.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy not? You have a gift.\u201d</p><p>The back of my neck prickled at the old topic. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t always care what our gifts are. I have Mom\u2019s store to deal with.\u201d My store. My store.</p><p>He looked at me a few seconds longer, as if processing that, and then turned back to the painting. When he finally sank onto the sofa across from me, his gaze landed on me like it had in the diner the day before. Heavy and purposeful. I wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of making me look away, so I lifted my chin, gripped my mug and focused on the heat searing my palm. That was good. Pain was distracting.</p><p>The only sound was that of the nearby clock on the table, and the screaming tension between us seemed to amplify it. He seemed to be weighing out his words, so before the agony of silence stretched out any further, I decided to cut to the point.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been, Noah?\u201d I asked, my voice wavering on his name. It sounded so odd to say it out loud. To be talking to him after so many years. Even Ruthie and I rarely brought the subject up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be home.\u201d</p><p>Home. \u201cWhat drove that decision?\u201d I asked, wondering where the words were coming from, because it certainly wasn\u2019t me. There was nothing in me capable of thinking out coherent questions at that point.</p><p>His gaze dropped to his cup. \u201cJust been on my mind since I retired\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations\u2014on that, by the way,\u201d I said.</p><p>He met my eyes again with a small smile that sent a tingle to my stomach. Damn it. I made a mental note not to bring about any more smiles. I didn\u2019t need to see him that way. Think of him that way.</p><p>Harley rounded the corner of the sofa he was sitting on and hurtled her big body up there with him, to his surprise\u2014and mine. He laughed and rubbed her neck as she rested her head on his leg. Traitor, I said in my mind, trying to shoot her mental ice daggers. She turned her face so that she couldn\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Dad\u2019s getting old. Linny\u2019s not gonna be able to do everything by herself when he can\u2019t work in the diner anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna cook?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He looked at me with something akin to playfulness, and I cursed myself again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a damn good cook.\u201d</p><p>I held my palms up in my version of playing back, but I was beginning to sweat under that robe. \u201cHey, you want to come back here to be a short-order cook, knock yourself out.\u201d</p><p>He gave a small silent chuckle that didn\u2019t really reach the rest of his face and shook his head almost imperceptibly. \u201cI\u2014have other irons in the fire, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cPrivate security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Made sense. His background was perfect for that. Secret soldiers that morph out of water are a good choice for security. But I was running out of nods and agreements and small-talk questions. It was going to come around full circle shortly, and I decided to make it now. \u201cWhy\u2019d you come over here, Noah?\u201d</p><p>The question barely made it out of my mouth. In fact, the last words were little more than a whisper, but he knew what I said. The intense look came back. The one that felt like lead, making the room feel lighter in comparison. Instead of answering, he picked up a framed photograph from the side table next to him. One with a smiling Becca and smaller Harley posing in the backyard.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter?\u201d he asked, not looking up from the photo.</p><p>I felt my chin tremble and an unnamed old emptiness ached within me. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks a lot like you at that age.\u201d His eyes made a slow trip to meet mine, and the weight of emotion in them pushed the air from the room. \u201cShayna\u2019s pregnant,\u201d he said. The words were slow and careful, as if he\u2019d practiced saying them. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want you to hear that from anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>My ears rang with the words, and I felt myself nodding as if he\u2019d just told me he\u2019d bought a new Crock-Pot. Pregnant. Noah and his new woman. Going to have a baby. That\u2014that was perfectly fine.</p><p>\u201cCon\u2014\u201d I stopped to clear my throat of the rocks that apparently settled there. \u201cCongratulations. That\u2019s\u2014wow, that\u2019s\u2014really cool.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me for far too long, as if waiting for me to quit babbling and nodding and get to my meltdown. I wasn\u2019t going to have a meltdown. I was a grown-up. And he had every right to have another child. I had. And it would have probably ripped his heart out if he\u2019d been around to see me pregnant again, and married, raising a baby, so my chest threatening to cave in was completely justified.</p><p>I focused on the way his fingers worked methodically on Harley\u2019s neck, massaging, making her eyelids get heavier and heavier. She was calm. I could be calm too.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re okay?\u201d he asked, pulling my attention back to his face.</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cOf course. How old is she?\u201d As that fell out of my mouth, I realized how it sounded. \u201cI mean, in relation to you,\u201d I added quickly. \u201cI mean, I only saw her for a second, but she looks really young. But\u2014maybe that\u2019s how they make them in Italy.\u201d I laughed and was dimly aware that I sounded insane.</p><p>Noah chuckled, his eyes staying serious and focused on me. I knew without a doubt that I already hated that new trick of his. It was unnerving.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s from Virginia,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cI assumed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a military brat,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were stationed overseas for several years when she was young, and Italy was her favorite place. After college, she went back.\u201d</p><p>Well, of course. Doesn\u2019t everyone?</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s thirty,\u201d he added. \u201cIn case you need to card her.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cCute.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, a crooked grin working on one side of his mouth. \u201cWhat can I say?\u201d</p><p>Warmth went from the center of my chest to all extremities on that grin, and I promptly got to my feet and set my mug on the side table.</p><p>\u201cWell, it sounds like everything\u2019s going your way, Noah. I\u2019m happy for you.\u201d</p><p>I wanted him to go. I needed him to go. Before I could really sink my thoughts into what he\u2019d told me, and before my mouth overloaded my brain. Because it was about to. I could feel it all up in my throat. He gently moved Harley\u2019s head and rose as well, bringing him a little closer than I anticipated, and I backed up a step and crossed my arms as those eyes looked straight through to the core of me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good to see you, Jules,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou look good.\u201d</p><p>I bit my bottom lip and dug a thumbnail into my arm. Dear God, he looked good, too. Even better up close. That voice that went with the eyes\u2014and the body, even buffed out and different, was still the same. But my thoughts wouldn\u2019t stop shoving their way to the surface.</p><p>\u201cWhy this month?\u201d I blurted out, wishing for duct tape over my mouth. \u201cWhy now? You could have picked any other time of the year to come back home. March, April\u2014July, even.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, the comfort left his eyes, and I saw the stricken, hurt boy I\u2019d seen him as last. My stomach tightened at the memory. He glanced over his shoulder at the painting and then back to me, and I had the irrational urge to wrap my arms around him and comfort him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I could have,\u201d he said, the words barely more than a whisper. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I thought of him sitting alone on the bench the night before and wondered if his perfect fianc\u00e9e in red knew about it. Knew about us, knew the history she was moving into.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Movement to my left caught my attention, and I turned to see Patrick coming down the stairs in jeans and no shoes, buttoning his shirt. \u201cPatrick!\u201d I said, a nervous laugh escaping my throat as I realized I\u2019d completely forgotten he was there. Oh, holy shit.</p><p>He stopped mid-step on the stairway when he saw us, an unsure smile on his face as he looked from me to Noah and back again. Harley jumped from the couch and met him halfway, big tail swinging, clearly thinking it was a party. I was able to register that Noah looked as if he\u2019d been slapped, right before my brain went on panic mode.</p><p>\u201cPatrick,\u201d I said, backing up farther and mentally pulling myself back together. \u201cThis is Noah\u2014Ryan. The\u2014\u201d I gestured with my hand as both men raised eyebrows at me. \u201cThe diner\u2014?\u201d I continued, praying for the rambling to stop. \u201cThat\u2019s Noah\u2019s dad. We grew up together. Me and Noah, not his dad.\u201d</p><p>Patrick narrowed his eyes at me and my psychotic rant and chuckled as he made it down the stairs and across the room to shake Noah\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, man,\u201d he said as they did the manly grip thing. \u201cPatrick Keaton.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face had shut down. I had no way of reading what he was thinking. \u201cLikewise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah just retired from the Navy,\u201d I added, feeling for some inane reason that I needed to fill space. \u201cAnd Patrick runs a construction contracting company.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded and patted Patrick on the shoulder as he walked around him. \u201cAgain, good to meet you. Y\u2019all have a good day,\u201d he said, setting his mug on the nearest table and making a beeline for the door.</p><p>I followed him, my heart slamming loudly in my ears. \u201cUm, Noah,\u201d I said for absolutely no reason at all. Other than that things felt unfinished and I had the crazy guilty feelings of being caught cheating on someone. Which was truly nuts, considering I owed neither of them anything.</p><p>\u201cJules\u2014\u201d he said, turning to meet my eyes for a second. In that second, I saw the last traces of the kids we were and the intensity that had defined us. Then his expression cleared and he was the stoic adult again. \u201cThanks for the coffee.\u201d</p><p>I watched him walk down the steps, take a pause at the bottom to glance back at the porch, and then disappear behind bushes that were in severe need of grooming.</p><p>\u201cOld boyfriend?\u201d Patrick asked, standing right behind me so close I jumped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d I blew out a breath and shut the door. \u201cI told you, we grew up together.\u201d</p><p>A laugh rumbled in his chest and I turned to face him and his beautiful eyes. The eyes that had originally seduced me at a pizza place, of all places, before they\u2019d pulled me to a pitcher of beer, two ice cream cones, and sex on my living room floor. Everything about him was reckless and dangerous and not my game.</p><p>\u201cYou know what that tells me, beautiful?\u201d he said while planting a kiss on my nose. \u201cIt says he was the first to spread those pretty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t finish that sentence,\u201d I said, putting two fingers against his lips.</p><p>He took my fingers into his mouth and nibbled them until I laughed and pulled them away. \u201cSo I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a site to go check on or something?\u201d I said as he pulled me into his arms.</p><p>\u201cTold you, there\u2019s a delay,\u201d he said. \u201cI do have some research to do though if I can bum off your wireless.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou brought your laptop with you?\u201d</p><p>He dropped some kisses on my lips and let go gently. \u201cWhen you never get to go home, babe, everything lives in the car with you.\u201d</p><p>As Patrick walked outside, I turned and walked the few steps to the nearest couch and gripped the back of it for grounding. My gaze fell on the painting across the room. The one Noah had zeroed in on like a bloodhound. A black and gray depiction of the park, the river, the bench. Our bench. A painting I\u2019d done for my son, to mark his first Christmas, even though he\u2019d never see it. One that even my mother had never known the inspiration for\u2014but my only claim to a day I could never get back. I\u2019d sat on that bench every day for weeks after Noah left, replaying the day, sketching and resketching the rough concept. Withdrawing into myself a little more. Praying he\u2019d come back. But he didn\u2019t. And after I finished the painting, I stopped going.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>As I watched Patrick go through his quick morning routine, I realized I never thought much about his life before. I was trying desperately to now. I needed something to pull my thoughts away from Noah\u2019s revelation, and Patrick was outstanding in that capacity. He was all about distraction.</p><p>And what an odd life that would be, running a contracting company. In order to stay in demand, his men had to be available to go anywhere, and so did he. He was always mobile, always on the move to the next job.</p><p>That worked for me.</p><p>Patrick was so outside my normal realm of anything, so free-spirited and daring, that having him around there in Copper Falls all the time\u2014actually dating\u2014would have been horrific. We would have never made it past the pizza. Well, yeah. We would have. That night was a weak moment on my part, but there definitely wouldn\u2019t have been a second pizza.</p><p>I kept taking deep breaths as I got dressed, trying to find normal. It wasn\u2019t anywhere near me.</p><p>\u201cCome on, fool, get it together,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>I pulled on a pair of worn soft jeans and my favorite soft fuzzy blue sweater. Not that it mattered that it matched my eyes perfectly or anything. Because it didn\u2019t matter. I couldn\u2019t care less whether Noah Ryan showed up in the vicinity of the diner or anything.</p><p>It was about comfort. I never wore jeans to work. I was adamant about professionalism. Not skirts like my mother always insisted on, but it was at least slacks.</p><p>Not today.</p><p>Today, moving up from my robe was a Herculean task.</p><p>Noah was back. He was engaged to be married. He\u2019d come to my house. And his wife-to-be was having his baby. All this was within the same twenty-four hours. My carefully structured world was wiggling. To hell with wiggling, it was swinging around like a damn lasso.</p><p>I grabbed my keys from the bowl at the bottom of the stairs and then paused, remembering Patrick was still there. I leaned over to catch a glimpse of him sitting at the kitchen island with his laptop, eyebrows knitted together as he read.</p><p>\u201cI have to go, you okay here?\u201d I said. The shock of my own words tingled over me. Did I just give someone free reign of my house? What if Becca played hooky again and came home to find him there? \u201cUm, I mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>Patrick looked up as I walked up behind him, a smirk tugging at one corner of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done, beautiful. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d I said, attempting to cover with a savvy smile.</p><p>He closed up his computer and rose, brushing my lips with a soft kiss. \u201cI know.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go kick this day in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Nothing sounded better than that.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Knowing Ruthie would be at the store before me, lighting her ever-loving candles to get the place smelling good, I texted her that I would be late. I had a stop to make, two blocks from my house.</p><p>I pushed the doorbell button twice before remembering it was broken, and then knocked on the dark blood-red door as hard as my knuckles allowed. Two stamped envelopes were clipped with a clothespin to the old metal mailbox that hung by the door, with Nana Mae\u2019s careful print written across them.</p><p>I heard Maddy, Nana Mae\u2019s five-hundred-pound cat, purring at the door before her owner got there. She was the one to look at me with disdain when the door opened. Nana Mae looked at me with a surprised smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, Julianna, what brings you over here?\u201d Nana Mae said, her wrinkles morphing into different patterns with her wide-spread smile. \u201cI was going to stop by tonight on my walk. What\u2019s the matter\u2014the coffeepot broke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh all you want, girly, you never come by this early,\u201d she said, waving me in and nudging Maddy over with one slippered foot. She still had on her morning attire of a magenta and white floor-length velour robe, zipped up to the neck. Her long white hair wasn\u2019t twisted up in its usual bone clips yet, but hung loose down her back. She looked older like that, more vulnerable than the cocky put-together woman she showed the world. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to open the store?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cRuthie\u2019s there. I texted her.\u201d</p><p>Nana Mae stopped mid-turn and narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you sick?\u201d She let her eyes peruse me from head to toe. \u201cYou have jeans on, Julianna.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a breath and let a chuckle out with it as I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never go in late,\u201d she said, not moving. \u201cIs it Becca? Something happen with Becca?\u201d</p><p>I laughed and linked arms with her, guiding us to the living room sofa. Maddy beat us there, sprawling across a good third of it and daring me to move her. I let Nana Mae do that. I knew she wouldn\u2019t bite her. When she got settled, I curled up on one end with a pillow to hug like I was fifteen.</p><p>\u201cNoah Ryan is home,\u201d I said. \u201cCame in yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d she said, sagging a bit. \u201cWell, that explains a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a woman he\u2019s engaged to,\u201d I added. \u201cAnd they\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The hand that was stroking Maddy paused mid-hover.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d she breathed. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll bet the old man is beside himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was pretty happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were there?\u201d she said, resuming her Maddy love.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBecca and I had lunch\u2014sort of\u2014at the diner when Noah and his new Barbie doll walked in. Johnny Mack was yelling it to the crowd.\u201d</p><p>That got me a look but she didn\u2019t pursue it. I knew it was being catty, but I felt I deserved a few moments of it.</p><p>\u201cSo Becca\u2014\u201d Nana Mae began, looking down at Maddy with a frown creasing her forehead. \u201cSweetie, if he\u2019s back\u2014the way this town talks, it\u2019s all going to stir back up again. I know you never told her, but you need to now.\u201d</p><p>My mouth went dry. Another fuel to my impending nervous breakdown. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to hear it from you than from someone else,\u201d she said, eyeing me sharply.</p><p>Noah\u2019s words. Again. Everything haunting me kept coming back to Noah\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cI wish Mom were here to take on some of it,\u201d I said, picking at a broken thread on the seam of my jeans. \u201cShe\u2019d make it sound right. Logical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was logical to her back then,\u201d Nana Mae said softly. \u201cYou know she did what she thought was right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut parents make mistakes, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tell Becca.</p><p>Hey, baby doll, you aren\u2019t really an only child, we have a secret kid stashed somewhere. What\u2019s he like? Don\u2019t know. Never met him.</p><p>That\u2019s every family\u2019s normal conversation, right?</p><p>I wanted to step in front of the nearest bus. If there were buses in Copper Falls. As odds go, I\u2019d have better luck with a scooter on a hell bender. In lieu of that kind of luck, I headed to work with uncharacteristic procrastination.</p> <p>I could call in sick. I never did that either, so Ruthie would think I was dying, but it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to take a day off.</p><p>Yes, it would. I\u2019d sit on my couch all day and picture Noah, and think and dwell and obsess myself into a state of doom. I needed to go, I was pretty sure we had a large order coming in, and it wasn\u2019t fair to put all of that on Ruthie. I could step outside my boundaries and park on the other side of the store instead of close to the diner like I always had. That way, I\u2019d avoid potential encounters.</p><p>A plan in place, I turned down Main Street, approached the bookstore, and kept right on driving.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a baby,\u201d I muttered, making the block.</p><p>But spying the bank and knowing I needed to cash an insurance check and snag a little cash for Becca\u2019s lunches\u2014assuming she actually stayed at school to eat\u2014I pulled in and justified it as productive. I blew out a breath as I tugged my purse onto my shoulder and entered the lobby. I had to shake off this crap. This was crazy. Yes, I had a bucket of shit swirling around, but so did everyone else. I wasn\u2019t special. And this was my town. I was not going to go skulking around it like a scared bird just because my particular bucket might get stirred up.</p> <p>I had to learn to live with Noah back in town, like it or not. And I had to tell my daughter things about myself that went against everything I\u2019d ever preached to her.</p><p>And I could never eat at the diner again. Or wear red.</p><p>I rounded the corner toward the tellers and was stopped short by a huge donation display of a giant red kettle, the sign reading Help our local families. Give at the teller window.</p><p>\u201cShow-offs,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>I started digging for my wallet as I stepped around the obnoxious kettle and right into a pair of arms and hands that I didn\u2019t see and wasn\u2019t ready for.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d I exclaimed, my head shooting up. \u201cI\u2019m so sorr\u2014\u201d</p> <p>My word was cut off as I looked up into Noah\u2019s face. Again. About four inches from mine. Damn it.</p><p>\u201c\u2014ry,\u201d I pushed out, as all the air left me.</p><p>Time stopped in those few seconds, and all the little nuances of his face that were new registered like files being tucked away. A tiny white scar above his upper lip. Another thin sliver of one through his left eyebrow. The little laugh lines next to his eyes. All new to me, and yet achingly familiar. The subtle scent I\u2019d picked up from him earlier filled my senses as his eyes panned my face in the same three seconds. I wondered what he saw.</p><p>His face went neutral again as he dropped his hands from their hold on me and backed up a few inches. I could still feel the heat imprints on my upper arms.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he echoed.</p><p>I should have just gone to work. This was what I got for being a big lame wuss.</p><p>I shook my head and gripped my purse strap. \u201cNo\u2014um\u2014I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d I pointed at the teller windows so I could shut up. \u201cGoing over there.\u201d I noticed he wasn\u2019t, and was kind of hovering around the desks. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpening an account,\u201d he said, nodding toward an empty desk. \u201cWaiting to, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. Of course he was. That\u2019s what you do when you move to a new place and plan to stay. Forever. Noah and Shayna and the newest little Ryan.</p><p>\u201cA joint one?\u201d I blurted out, feeling suddenly like I was standing off to the side watching myself talk.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNot just yet.\u201d</p><p>Not just yet. \u201cSo don\u2019t you have to have an address or something?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows drew together slightly on that. \u201cMy dad\u2019s is fine for now. I just need to get a debit card.\u201d He looked around the room, probably silently begging the bank lady to come back to her desk and rescue him. \u201cWe\u2019ll start looking for our own place soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good,\u201d I said, shaking my head at myself. Oh, good? Who was using my mouth?</p><p>Noah met my gaze again with that infuriating locked-in non-blinking thing of his, and as much as I wanted to look away, walk away, do anything that carried me away\u2014I couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m sorry about just dropping by earlier,\u201d he said, backing up yet another step. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt was fine\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously,\u201d he said, the hint of a smile at his lips. \u201cI didn\u2019t take into account that you might have\u2014someone there.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand along the back of his neck on the last words, as though they made him itchy, and I closed my eyes, wishing to die.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I mean, I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d I stumbled, opening my eyes again. Of all nights to call Patrick. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d I held my chin up, refusing to show weakness.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyebrow shot up, carrying the tiny scar with it. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said on a chuckle. He stepped forward again, and I reflexively crossed my arms. Holding my crazy in. \u201cJules, relax. You\u2019ve had a life. So have I. We both have someone in our lives, that\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a\u2014Patrick isn\u2019t a someone.\u201d I blew out a breath, cursing myself for not just going to work. And for talking. Because making myself out to be a rent-a-whore was infinitely better than letting him think Patrick was my boyfriend. I smiled and looked at the floor, drawing in a huge breath before looking back up at him. \u201cYou know what, Noah? This is just going to take some getting used to\u2014for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Noah let out his own breath, a relieved expression passing over his features. I\u2019d saddled up the white elephant in the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo\u2014let\u2019s just make the best of it and go about our normal days.\u201d</p><p>He did a head tilt that signified a shrug. \u201cWhatever normal is.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and ignored the shimmy in my stomach when he smiled back and dropped his eyes to my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m gonna head over there,\u201d I said, pointing to the teller counter. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he responded.</p><p>I told my feet to walk around him, and they brought me to my destination, where I was eternally grateful that no other customers were around. Because it took me a good minute or two to remember what I was doing and how to do it.</p><p>By the time I was done and turned around, he was seated in front of a petite blonde woman, one ankle resting on the other knee and his arm resting across the chair next to him. My knees nearly betrayed me at the beauty of him, so relaxed and confident, yet exuding raw masculinity as he chatted with this woman and smiled as she kept fingering her hair. Well, hell, of course she did. My God, he was positively edible.</p><p>I strode out with the intention of looking nonchalant and hoping not to trip over my own feet. When I looked his way and found him watching me leave, however, my throat closed up. I gave a polite smile, which he returned before turning his attention back on the blonde lady having sex with her hair.</p><p>I counted my steps back to the car. Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven steps to make it to a place where I could close and lock the door and have a nervous breakdown.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I said, my voice quivering on the word as I hit the lock. \u201cCrazy,\u201d I muttered, starting the car so the heat would blast through the vents. It wasn\u2019t all that cold, but I needed the heat and the noise to calm my blood down. One day at a time, I told myself.</p><p>My cell buzzed.</p><p>Where are you? From Ruthie.</p><p>Currently on a fast track to the loony bin, thanks, and you?</p><p>On my way, I texted back. Where I would stay from now on. Either the store or my house. Safely tucked where I could see people coming.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cWe need a night out.\u201d</p><p>I was shelving newly arrived books and arranging the new releases up front on the display table, listening to Ruthie sing along with the eighties music she\u2019d set up at a ridiculously low volume with an iPod station in the middle of the store. Away from the wall to avoid Johnny Mack\u2019s cane. So far, so good. But the day was young.</p><p>The day might be, but I felt ancient. Like I\u2019d lived three days before ten o\u2019clock. Starting in the store late didn\u2019t help me, either, as I was accustomed to arriving at eight and having all my busy work done before the store ever opened.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Ruthie said, moving some books around in my wake.</p><p>\u201cI heard you,\u201d I said, stacking more titles on the table. \u201cWe have that stupid party, don\u2019t we? The Chamber thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s after hours and requires a change of clothing,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s a party.\u201d</p><p>She made a huffing sound. \u201cWhatever, that\u2019s not till next week,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m talking like tonight.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just not up for that right now. I don\u2019t need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d she said, picking up the books I laid out and rearranging them with plastic boxes and easels. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you need. Get out and live a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Patrick for that,\u201d I responded, digging back in the box and smiling at an older gentleman carrying around an old used copy of a Jackie Collins novel. You just never knew.</p><p>\u201cOut\u2014being the pertinent word,\u201d Ruthie said. \u201cSomeplace not in your house.\u201d She put down her props for a moment and pulled a hair clip from the mammoth pocket of her big black sweater. She twisted her hair up in two seconds and still managed to look adorable. \u201cCome on, Jules, step out there with me. Eat, drink, talk to people who aren\u2019t me or Becca. Or your boy toy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Frank\u2019s fine with you stepping out and eating and drinking and talking?\u201d I asked, eyeing her.</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cFrank loves it when I go meet my clubs and committees. He gets to eat crap out of a box and chili out of a can.\u201d She laughed and waved a hand. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re swinging on a pole, Jules, I\u2019m just thinking of something like the Grille over in Katyville. Good food, good music\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I love their baked squash and peppered pork chops,\u201d said a woman standing nearby who I recognized as a regular from the courthouse. \u201cAnd all their desserts are to die for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, the blackberry cobbler,\u201d Ruthie said, nearly salivating.</p><p>The woman sighed. \u201cNow I have to talk my husband into taking me tonight.\u201d She laughed and touched Ruthie\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe we\u2019ll see you, Tess,\u201d Ruthie said, shooting me a look.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, okay?\u201d I said, bringing her social endeavor to a halt. \u201cI just want to get through the rest of this day and go home and watch TV in my sweats tonight. Maybe I\u2019ll even find something Becca and I can watch together for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing on Lifetime,\u201d she said.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhy? I love Lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates it. Get on SyFy.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cI swear we aren\u2019t related.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie and the woman who was evidently Tess laughed and headed to the register with a couple of books. I watched them, a little envious of the easy way Ruthie dealt with people. She had that way of connecting, of being so likeable that people just wanted to be around her. I mean, I knew I recognized that woman, but I couldn\u2019t have pulled her name out of the air if my hair was on fire and she owned all the water.</p><p>Ruthie was good at that. And she had something else, too. Watching her work the store, the customers, knowing what was right and how and when\u2014it was a little like watching my mom back in the day. Ruthie had learned from the master. Why didn\u2019t I?</p><p>A few minutes later, Ruthie looked at her watch. \u201cLunchtime.\u201d She looked at me questioningly. \u201cYou want something from next door?\u201d</p><p>I gave her a pointed look. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cI\u2019ll go pick it up.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say no again and my stomach grumbled loudly. \u201cMaybe McMasters still has some tacos left?\u201d</p><p>McMasters Meats was a butcher shop up on the next block that also served breakfast. I didn\u2019t hit it that often, but Becca did on her way to school. The bacon was to die for, along with the brothers who owned it, and right then that sounded wonderful. The breakfast tacos with bacon, not the brothers.</p><p>She gave me a lip curl. \u201cFrom breakfast? Doubtful.\u201d</p><p>Crap. \u201cOkay.\u201d Ruthie grinned and grabbed her purse from behind the counter, and I studied her. \u201cYou look too pleased. What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Ruthie frowned and did a little smirk, but didn\u2019t meet my eyes but for a second. \u201cI\u2019m picking up lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say a word, Ruthie.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me like I was a loon. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Noah is there, not a word.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath and did a little eye flutter like I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about, but I knew her. Given the chance, she\u2019d bow up with her little five-feet-five self and tell Noah Ryan just where to go and how to get there.</p><p>Ruthie wasn\u2019t swayed by his smile or his eyes or the way he looked with his arms crossed over his chest. She was oblivious to all of it. Because once upon a time she\u2019d believed in him. And he\u2019d let her down.</p><p>An old conversation drifted up from my memory bank.</p><p>\u201cI swear I\u2019m screwed, no matter what I do,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Jules. Noah loves you,\u201d Ruthie said. We were taking a break out back of the store, holding a bucket of chocolate chip ice cream with two spoons. \u201cHe\u2019ll ride this out with you no matter which way it goes.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my basketball belly and took another bite of the cold creaminess, feeling a little foot push against the side.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I said. \u201cSo why do I get the feeling that if I keep it, I lose my parents, and if I don\u2019t, I lose Noah?\u201d</p><p>Ruthie waved a spoon at me, pushing glasses up her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re not losing anybody, silly. Everybody\u2019s on your side, even if it\u2019s different ones.\u201d</p><p>So much for that. And Ruthie never forgot it. Not with my mother when I spiraled into a destructive mode afterward and she refused to acknowledge it, and certainly not with Noah, when he shocked the hell out of Ruthie by leaving me alone to deal with it.</p><p>She\u2019d waited many years to give him a piece of her mind, and I could see the wheels turning.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your order?\u201d she asked, clear-eyed and ignoring me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, Ruth Ann.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze turned deadly\u2014if she could pull off deadly. \u201cYou call me that again and you\u2019ll get a scene over there worthy of the evening news.\u201d</p><p>I held my hands up. \u201cOkay, okay, just\u2014please don\u2019t stir shit up. I\u2019ve already talked to him twice today and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s as tired of the subject as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares how tired he is,\u201d she muttered. \u201cLook at you.\u201d I looked down at myself in question and then back up at her. \u201cOne day back and he\u2019s got you coming in late to work, avoiding public places, wearing blue jeans to work\u2014which I happen to like,\u201d she added, doing a little flair with her hands. \u201cBut that\u2019s beside the point. It\u2019s not you. You\u2019re cowering in your own town,\u201d she said. \u201cYour town.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I am,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce upon a time you thought you\u2019d die without him. Then you thought you\u2019d crumble into dust if you ever saw him again.\u201d She leaned forward at me, intending to be forceful. \u201cWell, he\u2019s back. And you\u2019re still standing.\u201d</p><p>True. Although that crumbling part wasn\u2019t that far out of reach.</p><p>\u201cSo, your usual order?\u201d</p><p>I looked at her and shook my head. \u201cGet me a cheeseburger.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise and she chuckled. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd fries,\u201d I added. It may not have been ballsy to anyone else, and it wasn\u2019t as good as going over there, but it was a step outside my carefully constructed, lined, and sealed box.</p><p>I was still standing.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The cheeseburger only made me want more crap, so I figured that nachos would be a good follow-up for dinner that night. And the look on Becca\u2019s face when she came in was nearly worth the empty calories we were about to consume. She looked almost as excited as Harley, who was sitting at my feet looking up at me like I was God.</p><p>\u201cAre you dying?\u201d she asked. \u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d I said, chopping up the lettuce. \u201cCheck those beans in the microwave. See if they\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her backpack where she stood and headed that way. \u201cIs there a reason for the madness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason for your backpack on the floor?\u201d</p><p>She waved a hand as she grabbed a spoon to stir the beans. \u201cI\u2019ll get it in a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019d just put it on a chair to begin with, you wouldn\u2019t have to get it, and we wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe having this conversation?\u201d she finished for me with a sarcastic expression. \u201cOh, yes, we would. You\u2019d find a way.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, already tired. \u201cBecca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she said, turning. \u201cCan we just do that? Do we have to fight?\u201d Her gaze landed on my jeans. \u201cDid you go to work today?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and sucked my readied comment back in. \u201cYes, I did. Hi, Bec. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI passed my government test.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cThere was really a test? Wonderful!\u201d I said, grabbing the shredded cheese. \u201cSounds like a good day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, until Jill Bartlett decided to be a douche,\u201d she said, her shoulders slouching a little.</p><p>I glanced up. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>Becca shrugged and did the scrunch-up thing with her face that said the subject was about to be done. \u201cNothing. It was stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did tell you,\u201d she said, widening her eyes without meeting mine. She grabbed a plate from the cabinet and started building her nachos. \u201cIt was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing enough to mess up your day?\u201d I asked, attempting another angle.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Mom, can we just eat?\u201d she said, clearly done. And irritated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d I blew out a breath. \u201cYou bring it up and then get mad at me for it.\u201d I pulled the sour cream container from the fridge. \u201cI swear, baby, you make me want to bang my head on the wall sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Well, so much for the relaxing girls\u2019 night at home. I tried again in the living room.</p><p>\u201cGrab the TV trays and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s on.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me as if I\u2019d grown horns. \u201cWe\u2019re eating junk food\u2014and eating it in the living room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d I muttered, grabbing the trays myself. \u201cYou\u2019d think it was the first time ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time in Nonnie\u2019s house,\u201d Becca said, setting her plate on a tray and settling herself on the couch next to me as Harley jumped up on the other side of her and stared. \u201cWe did it sometimes at the blue house, but never here.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy, Bec, that was four years ago.\u201d</p><p>She held up her hands. \u201cJust saying.\u201d She scratched Harley\u2019s chin. \u201cI\u2019ll save you some,\u201d she whispered as Harley\u2019s tail thumped.</p><p>I frowned, thinking about it, wondering if she was right. We did have a more casual lifestyle in the old house she called the blue house. Hayden and I had leased it early in our marriage when it was painted a hunter green. He never liked it and painted it a sickly beige a few years later. When we divorced, I got the house, and one of my first actions as a single woman was to paint it whatever color Becca wanted. Thank God, her favorite color was blue.</p><p>When my mother died and left us this house, I thought it made sense to move here and sell our smaller one. I\u2019d second-guessed that decision a hundred times or more since then. Especially when I\u2019d hear Becca refer to it as belonging to my mother, or Nonnie, as she called her. Very seldom did she refer to it as our house.</p><p>\u201cWell, this doesn\u2019t hurt anything,\u201d I said, turning on the TV and attempting to make light of it. \u201cGive the table a break for the night.\u201d</p><p>I flipped through the on-screen guide as we ate, hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to resort to SyFy but willing to just to keep her there. Finally, I landed on a romantic comedy she\u2019d liked when she was younger. \u201cYes?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Her shrug was the best I was going to get, but the genuine laughs that came later were proof I\u2019d chosen well. Becca\u2019s two major appendages, her phone and her journal, rested by her side, and every now and then she\u2019d scribble something down or smile at a text. I couldn\u2019t help feeling a pang of envy toward whoever was pulling that reaction from her.</p><p>I remembered her being attached to my hip when she was little, always wanting to lay in my lap to watch TV, begging me to play with her hair. I missed those days.</p><p>I leaned sideways to bump heads with her. \u201cLoves, baby girl,\u201d I said during a commercial break.</p><p>\u201cLoves,\u201d she said, pulling the afghan from the top of the couch behind her and half curling into it as she leaned against me.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m going to miss this kind of thing when you go off to college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEating on the couch?\u201d she said, throwing her arms over her head in a contorted stretch I\u2019d probably need help to get out of. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you can still do that if you want.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cCute. You know what I mean. It\u2019s been just you and me for a long time, Bec. I\u2019m gonna miss you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and finger-combed her crooked hair back. \u201cWell, who knows,\u201d she said, hugging a pillow with a lazy smile. \u201cMaybe I won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Tiny bells rang in the back of my brain. Ones that had been poised and ready to ring for months now over the lack of college application enthusiasm.</p><p>I licked my lips. \u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning\u2014maybe I won\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d she repeated, finding that broken record again.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you heard back from any of them?\u201d I asked, fully aware of the answer since I got the mail every day.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s early,\u201d she said. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s always Community College if nothing else.\u201d</p><p>I felt my eyebrows raise. \u201cFor an associate\u2019s degree, Becca. For summer courses. You can\u2019t get a master\u2019s or even a bachelor\u2019s degree there. For the level of teaching that you want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d she said, pulling the afghan off and sitting up.</p><p>\u201cHere we go?\u201d I echoed. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple conversation, Bec, and a legitimate one. You graduate in less than six months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally aware of that,\u201d she said, nodding. \u201cBelieve it or not, they actually mention that once or twice at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me,\u201d I said, feeling the tide go out. \u201cAll I\u2019m doing is asking what the status is on your college plans. A lot of kids already have it planned out by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd\u2014I don\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was teaching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anymore,\u201d she said.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cBut it\u2019s always been teaching.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed at her face. \u201cOh, my God, Mom, have you ever been undecided on anything ever in your life? Has everything always just fallen in place for you?\u201d</p><p>I blinked at her, stunned, before a laugh worked up from my chest. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>Becca stood and carried her TV tray back to its designated place as the show came back on, and headed toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThe show, baby, it\u2019s back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d she said, waving a hand halfheartedly. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014gonna go read or something. Supper was good.\u201d</p><p>I watched her trudge up the stairs in her socks, shoes probably discarded in the kitchen. I kicked myself for ruining the night with logic. I was already missing the good vibes and warmth of hanging out with her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Bec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Mom,\u201d she said quietly before the house swallowed her up.</p><p>The photograph of her and Harley looked at me from the side table, and my eyes went to the park painting from there. Has everything always just fallen in place for you?</p><p>Wow.</p><p>I got up and walked upstairs, passing Becca\u2019s room and mine, going to a door that was seldom acknowledged anymore. I opened it, instantly breathing in the old familiar smells, as charcoal and paper and mostly dried-up oils wafted up into my senses. My art closet, easels hanging obediently on their hooks, drawers of supplies sitting unused, and huge portfolio envelopes of charcoal drawings leaned together in stacks.</p><p>I licked my lips as my fingers twitched, itchy to pull things out and explore. But to what end? Something else to fill up time I didn\u2019t have? I closed the door. I had a business to run now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A whole day with no drama.</p><p>No Becca tantrums\u2014she got up and fixed herself some Pop-Tarts and headed off to school. No Johnny Mack canings. And no Noah sightings. It felt almost normal. And had me feeling just skippy enough to hit Ruthie up on her night out offer. Why not, I thought. It had been forever since I\u2019d been out to eat with anyone except Becca\u2014well, unless you counted the pizza and beer with Patrick. I didn\u2019t count that, since it was really all just foreplay.</p><p>I even left work an hour and a half early so I could run some errands before I went home. And smiled at Georgette Pruitt when she flashed her new delivery of white carnations for her carnival parade float.</p><p>I got in my car without a second look at the diner, this made easier by the fact that I started parking on the other side of my building. Deciding to top off my gas tank, I slow-rolled into the station, turned down the song I\u2019d just cranked up, and got out.</p> <p>And enjoyed my peaceful feeling for about fifteen seconds into my fill-up.</p><p>The midnight blue Ford truck that pulled up behind me at the next pump had a chrome grille so shiny I could have fixed my makeup in it. I actually chuckled at that thought until the driver\u2019s door opened and Noah Ryan stepped out.</p><p>It was everything I could do not to groan out loud. I was so damn close.</p><p>He closed his door and glanced back inside to Shayna sitting in the passenger seat. \u201cHey, Jules.\u201d</p><p>I smiled politely, remembering the sort-of precedent we\u2019d set at the bank the day before. \u201cHey.\u201d</p> <p>Shayna opened her door then and stepped out, still looking adorable even without her chic red dress. She looked girl-next-door sweet in faded jeans and a hoodie pullover. I turned my focus back on the pump handle in my hand and thought of happy thoughts. I thought of Ruthie\u2019s cupcakes. Of Harley and her sweet face. And how\u2014</p><p>\u201cBabe, I\u2019m gonna grab a drink, want something?\u201d Shayna asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, a Coke, thanks,\u201d Noah said offhandedly as he pulled a card from his wallet and fed the pump its magical numbers.</p><p>His words triggered a memory. Coca-Cola used to be the only soft drink he\u2019d touch. \u201cCoke\u2019s the real deal, Miss Ju-li-an-na,\u201d his young smart aleck-voice reverberated in my head as I flashed on a second-grade elementary school moment. I\u2019d bought a Dr. Pepper from the \u201cCoke machine,\u201d as they are all called in the South. And a young, cocky Noah, sweaty and dirty from playing touch football at recess, stood there with his seven-year-old swagger and dissed my choice.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I said. \u201cI like Dr. Pepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a stupid girl,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a stupid name.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, who asked you?\u201d I said, scrunching up my nose. \u201cYou stink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s your name so long, Ju-li-an-na?\u201d he said, his voice mocking.</p><p>I made a face and walked around him. \u201cWhy do you have dog poop on your jeans?\u201d</p><p>He whirled around like a dog chasing his tail. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, sitting cross-legged on the grass. \u201cMade you look.\u201d</p><p>The glare I got was short-lived. He dropped to the ground in a lunge, as if he were practicing reaching first base. \u201cYou need a nickname.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI have one. My dad calls me Jules.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded and sat up, as if he had to give that some deep thought. \u201cThat\u2019s better. At least for someone who drinks Dr. Pepper.\u201d</p> <p>Wow, I thought with a start, there was something I hadn\u2019t pulled up in decades. I studied his profile as he leaned against his truck. Worn jeans that fit him like heaven. A blue sweatshirt with the sleeves shoved up on his forearms.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, honey,\u201d Shayna said, walking between our vehicles to hand him the icy can. She glanced my way and did a double-take, smiling curiously.</p><p>I saw Noah take the cue and his manners kick into gear. \u201cShit,\u201d I whispered, staring down at the pump handle. Don\u2019t do it, Noah. Don\u2019t do it, Noah.</p><p>\u201cJules,\u201d he began, and I raised my head with a smile as if I knew nothing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gotten to introduce you to\u2014Shayna.\u201d</p><p>I met his eyes and caught the pause, no matter how slight. He was going to say my fianc\u00e9e, but his tongue flipped it just in time. In any case, I was glad. I\u2019m not sure I could have masked my reaction that well.</p><p>Shayna turned to me with an outstretched hand and a soft smile. \u201cHi. Shayna Baird.\u201d</p><p>Her long dark hair was shiny and perfect, even pulled back into a carefree ponytail with shorter pieces falling around her face. She didn\u2019t look thirty. Fresh-faced and dressed like she was, she looked like she could model for an outdoor magazine or a college catalog. When I pulled my hair up like that, I looked like I was scrubbing my toilet.</p><p>\u201cJulianna White,\u201d I said, noting her firm handshake in lieu of the limp girly one I expected. Noah had said she was a military brat, so she\u2019d probably been taught right.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Julianna,\u201d she said, her eyes showing the slightest hint of wariness. She knew who I was. It was there.</p><p>\u201cYou too. Oh and\u2014call me Jules,\u201d I said, darting a look to Noah. \u201cMy full name usually means I\u2019m in trouble\u2014or my grandmother is hunting me down.\u201d</p><p>Shayna laughed. I laughed. Noah just looked as if he were stuck in a bad dream. My pump mercifully clicked off and I had something else to do besides stand there. She started making her way back around the truck and the words came out of my mouth before I even knew they were there.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, by the way,\u201d I said, feeling all the awkward atoms of the universe descend upon our little fifteen-foot area. \u201cOn the baby\u2014and the engagement.\u201d Noah\u2019s eyes fixed on me with a clear What the hell are you doing? look, and if I\u2019d had one for I have no fucking clue, I would have used it.</p><p>Shayna\u2019s steps faltered, and I watched as she looked at him with questions before turning slowly back to face me. \u201cUm\u2014thank you,\u201d she said with a more pallid complexion than was just there seconds before. She covered with a smile as she looked at Noah again. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was public knowledge yet. I thought just family\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oh, son of a bitch, I wasn\u2019t supposed to know. I wanted to jump in my gas tank. Noah wanted to run over me with that truck\u2014I could see it in his twitching jaw muscles.</p><p>\u201cI told Jules yesterday,\u201d he said, meeting her eyes with that dead-on look I was learning to recognize. I didn\u2019t apologize, knowing instinctively that would sound coy and even more like Noah and I were in cahoots.</p><p>After a few beats of silent stare-down between them, Shayna looked away, fidgeted with her hoodie, and brought her gaze back to me.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said with a smile carved from practice. Possibly from years of growing up as an officer\u2019s daughter and knowing when to be politically correct. \u201cWe appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, we. That was good. Very smart of her, staking her claim and making them a unit. I nodded and smiled at both of them as I closed my gas tank and \u201csee you later\u2019d\u201d them. I got in my car and released a long breath with my eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you idiot?\u201d I breathed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just say hello like everyone else? Holy shit.\u201d</p><p>I started the car and pulled out, not wanting to look back, but I did. I couldn\u2019t help myself. And there they were, still standing in front of the truck, facing each other in what looked like an intense conversation. I\u2019ll bet it was.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Becca was out the door within thirty minutes of walking in it, including a full wardrobe change, makeup refresher, and half a care what I thought about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she\u2019d asked when she came downstairs, spinning so that the mock chain-link belt she wore loosely around her hips spun at the ends.</p><p>\u201cI think I got whiplash,\u201d Nana Mae said. \u201cIf I got ready that fast, I\u2019d need to skip the going out and take a nap.\u201d</p><p>Nana Mae had walked over to surprise me with my favorite all-time dessert. The one thing I could not say no to. Mississippi Mud. So of course showering and getting ready for the evening had been temporarily delayed. Mud requires sitting and savoring, and Nana Mae and I were doing just that.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou look beautiful. Just try not to spin like that too much or you might take someone down.\u201d</p><p>She gave me a mischievous grin with narrowed sexy eyes. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s my evil plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then stay under the radar.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and I had the urge to snapshot the moment. For one precious second we were clicking.</p><p>Nana Mae gestured to the big red plate with the yum on it. \u201cGet you some Mud, Becca.\u201d</p><p>Becca eyed the plate as she plopped down next to me, and then snatched the remnants of my piece instead.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I said. \u201cGet your own!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wanted a bite,\u201d she said around the mouthful. \u201cOh, dear God. Talk about evil plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d I said, plucking another smallish piece of the gooey chocolaty marshmallowy nutty goodness from the plate. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing even remotely right about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I say live a little,\u201d Nana Mae said, holding her piece on a napkin away from Harley, who was eye level with it all and was nearly trembling with hope.</p><p>\u201cAre you driving?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, Lizzy is,\u201d she said, reaching over me to attack Harley\u2019s head with love scratches. To her credit, Harley tried to enjoy it, but the smell of melted chocolate trumped love. \u201cIt\u2019s four or five of us going to the mall and a movie and whatever.\u201d</p><p>Ah, that whatever is what made my heart pitter patter with joy. On the upside, Lizzy was a better driver than Becca was and a straight A student. I always wished she\u2019d sprinkle some of her glitter on Becca.</p><p>\u201cHome by midnight,\u201d I said as she rose, which got me more of the face I was used to.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Mom,\u201d she said, one hand on her hip. \u201cI\u2019m almost an adult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost being the key word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone else gets to stay out till one,\u201d she said, a frown scrunching the top of her nose.</p><p>\u201cWell, if Lizzy is driving all those everyones home at one, then how does she get home on time? Think of how considerate you\u2019re being,\u201d I said, reaching over to pick up that morning\u2019s newspaper from the end table.</p><p>Nana Mae snorted, and Becca just looked at me like I\u2019d gone off the deep end. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBec, it\u2019s four o\u2019clock,\u201d I said on a chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019ve got eight hours. What on earth are you complaining about?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged as she appeared to contemplate that, and then snatched up her bag at the sound of a car horn outside. \u201cBye, y\u2019all,\u201d she said, giving us both quick head hugs.</p><p>\u201cCheck in, Becca,\u201d I reminded. \u201cIs your phone charged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she called over her shoulder as Harley bounded after her, thinking it was time to go play. \u201cI know, I know, text you so you know I\u2019m not dead\u2014got it. Bye, Mom. Bye, Nana Mae.\u201d</p><p>And she was gone.</p><p>\u201cIt was better in my day,\u201d Nana Mae said, settling back into the couch pillows a little. Her brand-new sneakers glowed as white as her hair against her dark green sweats. \u201cWhen we\u2019d leave the house, we left the grid. No cell phones to track you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d I said. \u201cAlthough I had neighbors that were more efficient than any electronic device. Still do,\u201d I added, pointing. \u201cMrs. Mercer next door nearly called the cops the first time Patrick came over on his bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Kathleen Mercer sits in her living room bay window with binoculars every day,\u201d Nana Mae said. \u201cI\u2019m always tempted to turn around and moon her when I leave here, just to hear the scream.\u201d</p><p>I snickered. \u201cWell, she used to wear out the phone, too. Mom knew every place I stepped a foot in before I ever got home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you still managed to get yourself in a pickle,\u201d she said. Meeting her look, I felt the pull at my gut. \u201cKnowing my daughter, I\u2019m surprised she ever allowed you to have that boy in your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he wasn\u2019t,\u201d I said as Harley came back to stare at the Mud, her big head resting on my knee. I chuckled\u2014maybe a little too bitterly than intended. \u201cNothing ever happened in this house, I promise you.\u201d</p><p>Nana Mae patted my hand. \u201cAs I suspect you\u2019ll make sure is the case for Becca as well.\u201d</p><p>I paused, caught somewhere between then and now. \u201cWell, yeah. Obviously I hope she isn\u2019t doing anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother hoped the same thing,\u201d she said. \u201cJust as I did for her.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cI sincerely doubt my mother ever did anything that scandalous.\u201d</p><p>Nana Mae wiped her fingers clean of the sticky chocolate. \u201cWell, no, she didn\u2019t get herself pregnant, if that\u2019s what you mean, but she certainly pushed her boundaries at times.\u201d</p><p>Curious. My mother pushing boundaries. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike sneaking out at night, stealing her daddy\u2019s cigarettes, reading books she wasn\u2019t supposed to read and stashing them under her mattress.\u201d Nana Mae chuckled. \u201cOr carving out old books to hide things like letters from boys\u2014and her daddy\u2019s cigarettes.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her in amazement. Those things did not mesh with the woman I knew as my mother. \u201cHow have I never heard this before?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNever came up before, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she wasn\u2019t about to tell me,\u201d I said, brushing crumbs into my napkin. I got up to find a ziplock to store the rest of the Mud.</p><p>Nana Mae laughed softly as she worked to her feet as well. She scooped up the plate and followed me to the kitchen. \u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cWould you? Have you?\u201d</p><p>I turned from my open cabinet and gave her a look. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then, Julianna. Then don\u2019t be so hard on your mother.\u201d She laid her hands flat on the cold granite of the island and clicked her ring against it. \u201cWe don\u2019t tell our kids about our questionables, past or present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want me to,\u201d I said, setting the ziplock bag down.</p><p>Nana Mae picked it up and began moving the pieces of Mud cake inside it. \u201cOnly because your past has joined the present, my girl. And Becca deserves not to hear it on the gossip mill.\u201d</p><p>I watched her with her old, wrinkled, heavily veined hands placing each piece in carefully. Her nails were still painted perfectly every time I saw her, hair always smooth and tidy. Even in the days surrounding my mother\u2019s passing, she always looked her best, sitting at her daughter\u2019s bedside day and night in full dress and makeup until the advanced cancer took her from us. So much like my mother in those little ways, and a complete opposite in others.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Mom would say if she were still here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look up, just finished her task. \u201cShe\u2019d probably disagree with me,\u201d she said softly. \u201cBut she always did have her own mind. Would swear the sky was green just to argue with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou miss those arguments, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nana Mae met my eyes with a little wink before she looked away, but I saw the glimmer of emotion first. \u201cEvery day.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me like that.\u201d</p><p>Harley lay curled in a half circle next to my chair as I got ready, her head resting on the bath towel I\u2019d discarded. Her little eyebrows kept alternating up and down as she looked imploringly at me, devastated that I was leaving her alone on a Friday night. After all, I was always the steady one, the home body. It was usually she and I watching Lifetime movies on the couch on Friday nights, while Becca either went out with friends or had them over.</p><p>Now, as I sat putting on my makeup with a sulky dog at my feet, I recalled my nights out at her age and took a fearful breath. Not the time to think of those things. I knew what I was doing at seventeen, and it frequently involved steaming up the windows of Noah\u2019s car. But I couldn\u2019t put my indiscretions on Becca. My questionables.</p><p>She\u2019d had boyfriends, but nothing that lasted long enough to get gropy to my knowledge. And most of her outings were with groups, so I always felt a little safer with that.</p><p>How could I tell her what I\u2019d done at her age and ever expect any semblance of respect on that subject.</p><p>My cell buzzed on the dresser and I snatched it up to see Becca\u2019s name.</p><p>Checking in, Sarge.</p><p>Cute.</p><p>Ha ha, I texted back.</p><p>Then a picture text came in showing her in a royal blue strapless body-snug dress that fit her like a dream\u2014if she were twenty-two and lived in New York City.</p><p>At the mall. Wnt this dress 4 prom. It\u2019s on sale rt now.</p><p>I decided to put the phone down. Prom was still four months away, and I wasn\u2019t about to get in an argument of wills over a hoochie dress I\u2019d never buy at any price.</p><p>I finished up the last attempts at making my wavy mess look cool, pulling back the heavy sides so that soft pieces fell around my face. I sighed, remembering Shayna\u2019s careless perfection, and wished I could be that fortunate.</p><p>Disgusted, I went to stare at my clothes. A dress? Jeans? I knew Ruthie would have some version of black going on. I could do the same and we\u2019d blend together like Twinkies or I could be bold and go for color. I remembered the hot red dress Shayna had on the day they arrived, but I didn\u2019t have anything that good.</p><p>And then I slammed my closet door, making Harley jump to her feet and look at me for her next move.</p><p>Damn it, I needed to stop! Here I was trying to live up to a woman more than ten years younger than me who I didn\u2019t even know, just because she was with a man I no longer had.</p><p>\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d I said to Harley, who wagged her tail uncertainly, not sure if we were going to war or if Mom just had a loony moment. \u201cThis is going out to eat with Aunt Ruthie, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She took a step toward me and I scratched her soft head.</p><p>I pulled a pair of dark jeans from a drawer, a black tank top, and a red\u2014yes, red\u2014gauzy see-through long-sleeved blouse. Kinda sexy without being overtly so. I wasn\u2019t looking to pick up anybody or find myself another Patrick. One was quite enough.</p><p>I grabbed my body spray and spritzed myself once and Harley twice. She didn\u2019t see the humor in it and promptly ran downstairs. I zipped up my black low-heeled boots and took one last look in the mirror.</p><p>When you are really young, you think of the mid-forties as so ancient, and that of course all of life\u2019s plans for you have long fallen into place. I twisted to see my backside and then back around to pose and pretend walking.</p><p>Okay, maybe I didn\u2019t look ancient, thanks to good genes and hair color, but where were those life plans? Was I somewhere else when they were falling?</p><p>\u201cOkay, Harley-bear,\u201d I said when I made it downstairs to the door. \u201cStand guard.\u201d</p><p>Which clearly meant something different in her language, because she jumped on the couch and wrapped her body around two pillows.</p><p>I was kind of envious of her evening.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The Grille parking lot was pretty packed when we got to the other side of Katyville. We were either at the happening place or all the other restaurants were closed. Circling around to the back, we managed to snag a parking spot. Music emanated from the walls as we approached the screened-in patio, a section clearly being avoided due to the cold.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get some jalape\u00f1o poppers,\u201d Ruthie said as she swung one of the front doors open and the full volume of the music thumped into us.</p><p>\u201cI just want a margarita,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that, too.\u201d</p><p>The tables were mostly full, both high-stooled and regular, but the hostess wound us through them, past a large table of laughing women, to a small high table on the other side of the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll work,\u201d Ruthie said, settling herself on her stool. \u201cGood view. Now, let\u2019s get something greasy and some alcohol to wash it down with.\u201d</p><p>She looked adorable, as usual. Her straight dark hair was pulled to one side and fastened so that it rested prettily over her shoulder. She wore black opaque tights with a fitted black tunic dress over them, and knee-high boots similar to mine. I knew it would be black. I hadn\u2019t seen her in color in probably fifteen years.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Frank doing tonight?\u201d I asked when our drinks came.</p><p>\u201cWatching zombie movies,\u201d she said, licking the salt from the rim of her glass. \u201cHe saves those up for when I\u2019m gone because I won\u2019t watch them with him.\u201d</p><p>We ordered food and I watched the dance floor, trying to remember the last time I\u2019d been dancing. When Hayden and I were married? Possibly. I know we used to tear up a two-step when we were dating, and probably did later too, but it was too far back to remember. I knew for a fact that I hadn\u2019t danced with anyone I\u2019d dated since.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d I said. \u201cI just realized I\u2019m old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust now?\u201d Ruthie said, snickering over her drink. \u201cI realize that every morning as I groan my way out of bed. Now, if I were independently wealthy or owned my own business so I could maybe or maybe not go into work\u2014maybe I wouldn\u2019t have to groan so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a dig?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said with a wink. \u201cI\u2019m just saying. I dream big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of business do you want to start?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She waved a hand. \u201cOh, I have no idea, it\u2019s just something Frank and I have always talked about. We have the money, but the right opportunity just hasn\u2019t come bouncing along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019d be excellent at whatever you bounce into,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhy, thank you,\u201d she said with a little mock bow. \u201cSo have you sent in your sale ad for the carnival flyer?\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at her, wishing I had lasers to go with them. \u201cSeriously? That\u2019s what we\u2019re starting with?\u201d</p><p>She set her drink down and held out her hands. \u201cWhat, it\u2019s a valid question! One I get asked at least twice a day. I\u2019m only asking you once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I said. \u201cYou take it on this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was due today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I know you, you already have something cooked up and designed on the computer,\u201d I said.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cJust in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, knock yourself out,\u201d I said, sipping my margarita. \u201cI pass the sales genius to you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re such a procrastinator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m totally not,\u201d I said, frowning. \u201cI just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate this festival,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said defensively. \u201cI don\u2019t hate it. It\u2019s perfectly fine\u2014and yeah, I\u2019m lying, I hate it.\u201d I laughed, holding up my glass.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, some of the snark leaving her expression. She looked at me lovingly. \u201cI understand why you hate it. But you could just have fun with it like everyone else,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fake snow parade in Texas, Ruthie. When\u2019s the last time you saw snow?\u201d I leaned my elbows on the table. \u201cI can tell you all three times for me. Kindergarten, senior year, and five years ago when Becca was twelve and the school let them out to play behind the gym.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Ruthie said. \u201cIt\u2019s rare, and therefore fun to be corny with it.\u201d She leaned forward. \u201cBe corny with it.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my temples. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because the senior year instance was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies,\u201d said a male voice from behind me, cutting Ruthie off and making me jump in my seat. I swiveled to see Patrick smiling down at me and Ruthie smiling up at him.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, tilting her head in amusement and darting a glance my way.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap, Ruthie\u2014you haven\u2019t met Patrick, have you?\u201d I said, startled as I realized that. She wasn\u2019t at the store the one time he\u2019d come by.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, I haven\u2019t,\u201d she said, widening her eyes with a holy-shit look. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the name, heard the stories\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, I have stories?\u201d Patrick asked, managing to look completely wicked.</p><p>\u201cOh, most definitely,\u201d Ruthie said, absently stirring her drink with her straw. \u201cThe\u2014motorcycle trip alone was worth the time.\u201d</p><p>Patrick laughed, a deep sound that had my senses stirring. A nice feeling, but I wasn\u2019t there for that. I was out with Ruthie, for a girls\u2019 night, not trolling for sex.</p><p>\u201cSo, you,\u201d I said, attempting sultry. Sort of. By the look I saw pass over Ruthie\u2019s face, I assumed I failed. \u201cWhat are you doing out here tonight?\u201d</p><p>He nodded toward the bar. \u201cJust picking up some quick dinner, and then driving to Austin tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAustin?\u201d Ruthie said.</p><p>\u201cMy next job starts there on Monday,\u201d Patrick said, his hand resting on the back of my chair. \u201cHave to go get set up this weekend and get my guys ready. Make sure everything works and everyone is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a while, huh?\u201d I said, meeting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, a soft look playing there that had me thinking naughty things. \u201cProbably till mid-February. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, you can have phone sex,\u201d Ruthie said, her tone casual.</p><p>Patrick laughed and I stared at her. \u201cRuth Ann.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about that name, Ju-li-an-na?\u201d she said on a laugh. It was meant as an inside joke, a nod to our childhood, but it brought Noah back to the forefront, and I felt my stomach tighten up.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we will,\u201d Patrick said, his tone half flirting with her, half promising me something hair-raising as he circled the subject back. He chuckled as he slid past my chair. \u201cBe back in a little bit, beautiful,\u201d he said in my ear, sending goose bumps down my back as he headed for the bar.</p><p>We watched him together for a second. \u201cGod, I\u2019m such a damn easy lay when it comes to him,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI can see why,\u201d she said, and then she thumped me on the arm. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me he looked like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? Hot?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean\u2014\u201d She circled her hands, looking for the right gesture. \u201cBad. Dangerous. Like he could\u2014gnaw on raw meat or something.\u201d</p><p>A laugh tickled me at the visual. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he likes his meat cooked,\u201d I said. \u201cThen again, it\u2019s never come up. We had pizza once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeat lovers.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie\u2019s look had me giggling like a schoolgirl. If a schoolgirl would be drinking a top-shelf margarita.</p><p>\u201cSo are you drunk yet?\u201d Ruthie asked when we recovered.</p><p>\u201cOn half a margarita? God, I hope not,\u201d I said on a laugh. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips and peered down into her glass before looking back up at me with a very contemplative expression.</p><p>\u201cI have something I need to tell you,\u201d she said, attempting a smile that I knew her well enough to recognize as placating.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone dying?\u201d I asked, remembering Becca\u2019s question from the other night.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then,\u201d I said, taking a deep breath. \u201cAnything else is minor. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>She took another swallow, and my skin tingled with anxiety I couldn\u2019t even name.</p><p>\u201cBecca asked me how to get on birth control.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I remembered being Becca\u2019s age. All too well. I even remembered thinking how enlightened and cool I\u2019d be if the subject ever came up with my own kid. I was a moron.</p><p>And all I could do with my decidedly uncool self was sit there and listen to my heart thumping in my ears. The music hovered in the background somewhere as I visualized Becca pregnant with her crooked hair, or taking an infant up to her room to feed it and losing it in the hovel that was her bed.</p><p>\u201cJules?\u201d</p><p>My name broke through, and I felt Ruthie\u2019s hand on mine.</p> <p>\u201cJules, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s having sex?\u201d I said, my voice sounding scratchy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Ruthie said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d I echoed, covering my face. As I dropped my hands and met her eyes again, a different switch flipped. \u201cHang on, how do you know this?\u201d I said, sitting straighter.</p><p>Ruthie tugged her bottom lip between her teeth, a telltale sign with me that she was uncomfortable. My head spun with the possible conversations.</p> <p>\u201cShe stopped at the store today after school,\u201d Ruthie began. \u201cAfter you left. And we got to talking while I was cleaning up.\u201d</p><p>Today. The day she flew in the door and got ready in a flash. Left with a group of girls. Wasn\u2019t it girls? She just said a group. Shit.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The alcohol suddenly sat like acid in my stomach. The giant platter of loaded nachos and jalape\u00f1o poppers we\u2019d decided to share arrived, and I grabbed one almost before it even landed on the table. I knew that feeling of curiosity and adrenaline and lust. And I knew where it could lead her if she wasn\u2019t clearheaded about it. \u201cShe\u2019s got a boyfriend? I didn\u2019t even know she was seeing anybody.\u201d</p><p>It occurred to me as I shoved a second one into my mouth that it was my second time that week to have nachos. And then it occurred to me that having such a meaningless thought at such a crucial revelation might mean I was losing it.</p><p>Ruthie eyed me as I pushed another chip loaded with shredded chicken, dripping cheese, and steaming beans in my mouth before she spoke.</p><p>\u201cAnyway\u2014she started talking about this boy she met\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMet?\u201d I said, ceasing the chewing. \u201cShe\u2019s just met someone and she\u2019s already having this conversation?\u201d</p><p>Ruthie smiled as you would to a frustrated child. \u201cCalm down, Jules. This is why she came to me and not you.\u201d</p><p>And that was just the icy dousing I needed to jolt me into silence. I bit my lip to fight back the burn that started in my chest and crept upward. That was the crux of it. Becca had gone to Ruthie to talk about the most intimate of things. Something I couldn\u2019t have gone to my mother with either. I blinked and swallowed hard as that reality pushed the burn up into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ruthie said, grabbing my hand again, but I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said. \u201cGo on, I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>She took a long swallow of her drink and glanced over to where Patrick was standing at the bar, chatting up the bartender.</p><p>\u201cShe met a boy, his name is Mark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMark,\u201d I echoed. \u201cFrom school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask, but I assume so,\u201d Ruthie said. \u201cHis dad is one of Patrick\u2019s crew.\u201d</p><p>My ears rang with the information. I\u2019d seen Patrick with his crew before, most of them much rougher-looking than he was. A young version of that?</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s pressuring Becca for sex?\u201d I asked, hearing my voice go up a little higher and louder than normal. At precisely the wrong time.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The deep voice was behind me and louder than mine ever dreamed of being, and everything in me cringed. I turned just as Hayden stepped up to our table, looking at me all wild-eyed. With one look I knew he was at least three or four beers into a good buzz, but unfortunately still very coherent.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, no,\u201d Ruthie said, waving hands at both of us before something blew up. \u201cNobody\u2019s pressuring anybody for anything. Shit,\u201d she added, dropping her head for a moment. \u201cThis is out of hand. She was just asking questions is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the dad?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat dad?\u201d Hayden asked. \u201cAnd what the hell is going on with Becca? Why\u2019s she asking questions about sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, this was a private conversation,\u201d Ruthie said, glaring up at him.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore it\u2019s not,\u201d he said.</p><p>I held my head together with my palms. \u201cHayden, it\u2019s okay that she\u2019s curious, that\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><p>It just wasn\u2019t okay that she didn\u2019t come to me with that curiosity. That she was going so far as to ask about birth control. That wasn\u2019t okay. But I wasn\u2019t fueling that flame in front of Hayden.</p><p>\u201cI heard you say that someone was pressuring her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just\u2014\u201d I stopped and took a deep breath. \u201cIt was my misunderstanding, okay? I was flying off the handle just like you are now.\u201d I turned back to Ruthie, who looked as if she\u2019d rather chew a brick. \u201cWho\u2019s the dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she said his last name was Wallace,\u201d Ruthie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter who the dad is?\u201d Hayden said.</p><p>\u201cBack in a minute,\u201d I said to Ruthie as I got up to join Patrick at the bar before he could rejoin us. I was frazzled enough without Hayden getting in the mix. At the look on her face for being left with him, I made a mental note to buy her another margarita.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful,\u201d Patrick said as I reached his side.</p><p>\u201cDo you have someone working for you named Wallace?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Patrick\u2019s eyebrows raised just a fraction. \u201cUm\u2014yeah. David Wallace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLives in Copper Falls?\u201d</p><p>The eyebrows lowered to a frown. \u201cNo, none of my men do. But I think a couple of them have ex-wives around here. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a son named Mark?\u201d I asked, feeling very much like a prosecutor and yet unable to stop shooting off the questions.</p><p>Patrick turned to face me fully. \u201cI have no idea, Jules. We don\u2019t sit around comparing photos. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter wants to have sex with a boy named Mark and said his dad works with you,\u201d I blurted out, realizing somewhere in the places where logic lived that I wasn\u2019t anywhere close.</p><p>The eyebrows shot back up and he cleared his throat. \u201cOh. Well, I guess he probably does then.\u201d When I continued to stare at him, he gave me a questioning look. \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>There was a pen lying on the bar, and I picked it up and started clicking it. \u201cSo what\u2019s this guy like?\u201d</p><p>Patrick narrowed his eyes. \u201cBabe, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this, but what does his dad have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey learn it from somewhere.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and winked randomly at the woman behind the bar as she handed him a to-go box of something that smelled wonderful. \u201cThey learn it from somewhere? Because he couldn\u2019t just be a normal horny teenage boy, right?\u201d He squeezed my hand and took the pen I was furiously clicking, setting it back down. \u201cCome on, Jules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, look what he sees,\u201d I said, refusing to be placated. \u201cY\u2019all pick up women wherever you land. If he sees him screwing around all the time\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna stop you right there,\u201d Patrick said, the jovial expression leaving his face. \u201cDespite what you obviously think of me and my guys, we aren\u2019t traveling fuck magnets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think you meant it exactly like that,\u201d he said, pushing off the bar with a fired-up coldness I\u2019d never seen before. \u201cLet me tell you something. We have a job to do. We work hard, eat crap food, sleep in cheap motels, and move on to the next job. What my guys do on their few off hours is not my business, and what their kids may do damn well isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrick\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook in your own house before you start pointing fingers, Jules,\u201d he said, turning to leave. \u201cI didn\u2019t screw around with you all by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaimed, a little louder than I intended. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Maybe your kid is the one watching.\u201d</p><p>At that, he left. I watched his back as he wound his way around the tables and pushed the front door open.</p><p>\u201cWant something, hon?\u201d the bartender lady asked me, pulling my attention back.</p><p>I blinked and held my hands against my stomach, feeling the stab to the gut that Patrick had just left there.</p><p>\u201cUm, can I get two more margaritas on the rocks to that table?\u201d I asked, pointing to where Ruthie sat looking irritated and Hayden stood hovering like a hawk.</p><p>I made my way back, feeling heavy and wrong and stupid. Was Becca paying closer attention to my actions rather than my words? She knew what we were doing, she\u2019d said it out loud. The one time in my life that I\u2019d allowed myself outside my own rule book was with Patrick, and that\u2019s when she decides to pay attention?</p><p>Ruthie just met my gaze with that universal silent communication all best friends have. She saw Patrick leave, she saw my face, my deflated composure. She knew how I felt. That was enough while we had an audience. Hayden, on the other hand, was still up on level four somewhere.</p><p>\u201cYour boyfriend leave?\u201d he said, a twitch to his jaw telling me that the word bothered him.</p><p>I knew that even after our years apart he still cared about me. He\u2019d always loved me more than I did him, and as unfair as that was, I\u2019d married him anyway. Back then, I was damaged goods. Mourning the loss of a child that no one but Ruthie ever spoke of with me, and still carrying a torch for the love of my life. A love that had left me to mourn alone. To worry about him, cry for him, curse him, and sometimes hate him. It took Hayden two years to win me over completely, and although I never felt that all-consuming passion again, I assumed that was my fate.</p><p>He was cute and witty and smart and could always make me laugh when laughing didn\u2019t come naturally to me anymore. Hayden found me in my darkest place and showed me the light again. That was enough. His controlling nature and lack of an off switch when he drank made it not enough.</p><p>I ignored his question and palmed my glass, sucking up what was left of my margarita and watching the dance floor. I needed the cold and the tangy citrus to cool my blood.</p><p>\u201cI have the right to know what\u2019s going on with her, Jules,\u201d Hayden said, leaning into my line of vision.</p><p>As an upbeat country song filled the room, I met his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s dance.\u201d</p><p>He backed up a step. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me,\u201d I said, hearing Ruthie snicker to my right. I grabbed his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s see if we still remember how to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I heard him say behind me as I pulled him along.</p><p>I wheeled around to face him. \u201cTrying to let off a little steam, Hayden. Trying not to be my mother.\u201d The burn hit the backs of my eyes and I blinked back the impending flood. \u201cShe went to Ruthie with this. Instead of me,\u201d I said, trying to control the quiver that laced my words.</p><p>Hayden\u2019s eyes panned my face and went soft. He\u2019d lived with me long enough to know where my head was.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the last time you two-stepped?\u201d he said finally.</p><p>\u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and smiled that smile that always made women look twice, making me chuckle to myself.</p><p>\u201cLord, you\u2019ve got some rust to work out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, get on it then,\u201d I whispered, making him laugh as he pushed me out onto the dance floor.</p><p>Time fell backward a little as he rested his right hand against my neck to guide me, and my feet remembered what to do. The song was quick, upbeat, and we fell into our easy rhythm almost immediately, sliding in and out and around the other couples that were taking it a little more conservative.</p><p>\u201cLike riding a bike,\u201d Hayden said over the music. When I laughed, Hayden dared me with his eyes. \u201cReady to kick it up a notch?\u201d</p><p>It was easy to have fun with him, he had that way of somehow knowing what I needed and making sure I got it. Even though I knew we both had Becca spinning around in our heads, he focused on spinning me. He pushed me away, keeping hold of my hand, and I turned in a circle alone and then around him, all the while making tracks around the floor. He whirled me back into his arms, grinning.</p><p>\u201cNot bad, lady,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s spin,\u201d I said, grinning back.</p><p>We got our footing, and he winked down at me as his hand gripped the back of my neck tighter and we started spinning around the floor to the last part of the song. The other couples on the dance floor moved a little to the side to give us space, and as the song came to an end, clapped and hooted for us. I saw Ruthie stand up from our table and whistle.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said, feeling the heat from the rush and the spotlight rise up to my face. \u201cThat\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>Hayden hugged me lightly, and as a slow country song came on, squeezed my hand. \u201cOne more?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated, knowing how sexy and intimate a two-step waltz could be. Especially knowing how sexy he could make it. It might have been several years, but I wasn\u2019t losing my memory just yet. Not that I was afraid I\u2019d suddenly jump into bed with him or anything, but I also liked keeping the lines clean between us.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cFor old time\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cOld time\u2019s sake, huh?\u201d</p><p>But as Tim McGraw crooned \u201cPlease Remember Me,\u201d Hayden smiled and took that as a yes, pulling me close and moving us around the floor. I didn\u2019t fight it. It was familiar, and I guess something in me needed that normalcy, as bizarre as that was. Slow dancing with your ex-husband probably shouldn\u2019t be normal, especially that way, with the combination of bodies moving slowly together in a close rhythm and legs going in between each other.</p><p>The lights on the floor had turned low, with little spotlights shining on the tables that flanked the dance floor, making those people glow a little.</p><p>He pulled me tight against him as we did a slow spin, his fingers going up into my hair and my face pressed into his chest, filling my senses with the same cologne he\u2019d worn since I bought it for him on our two-year anniversary.</p><p>Something in my head rang out with warning bells, that I was maybe enjoying this too much and my clean lines were fogging up a bit. So when the spin was done, I pulled back a little and smiled up at him, noting the fog in his eyes as well.</p><p>He\u2019d had me with a slow dance when we first met, and I was damned if I was going to follow up with it now. He pushed me out to do a turn, and I breathed a sigh of relief as I saw it in his face too. The need for distance, accompanied by a grin that said he knew he\u2019d gotten to me in that one moment.</p><p>I smirked at him. \u201cShut up.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and spun me around carelessly, and as I came around laughing, another pair of eyes sank into me from the edge of the dance floor.</p><p>The song crooned about remembering, and everything in those eyes remembered. My feet faltered as Noah stood there, dressed in all black like some stealth god, leaned against his table, arms crossed over his chest, with every possible nuance of hurt, anger, and defiance playing over his features. Even in the near darkness, it emanated off him like a glow stick.</p><p>Hayden followed my gaze and pulled me with him, my lungs filling with air as I realized I\u2019d stopped breathing. How long had he been there? And where was\u2014</p><p>As we made another turn, I saw her. Sitting at the table, watching him. As he watched me. His face was stony, his body taut with raw power. Like he was spring-loaded.</p><p>\u201cFocus,\u201d came Hayden\u2019s voice just above my ear.</p><p>I stumbled and got my feet back on track. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>We made it around the floor one more time, but he managed to avoid passing them again, moving among other couples instead. I did notice that Noah had sat down, though, and I breathed a little easier.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Hayden said when the song ended and we walked slowly back to my table. The seriousness had crept back on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, my voice husky. I cleared my throat and grabbed my new margarita that awaited me on the table. \u201cThank you, Hayden, that was fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean since he\u2019s back,\u201d he said, his eyes boring into mine.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s back?\u201d Ruthie said, even though she instantly looked around, knowing exactly who the who was.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Hayden,\u201d I said, trying to make light of it. \u201cWe\u2019re all grown-ups now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he said with a smile that didn\u2019t make it all the way up. \u201cThat\u2019s why you go numb every time you see him?\u201d He thumbed at the dance floor behind him. \u201cYou nearly landed on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it rest, please?\u201d I said softly. \u201cAre you here by yourself?\u201d</p><p>He looked at me one more moment, then shook his head. \u201cWith some buddies from work.\u201d</p><p>I patted his arm. \u201cWell, go hook back up with them. Trash your ex-wife for thinking she could still dance.\u201d</p><p>When he finally left after ordering a beer, I sat down heavily. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where is he?\u201d Ruthie asked.</p><p>\u201cFucking everywhere,\u201d I said, lifting my hair and fanning my neck. I pointed across the dance floor. \u201cHe\u2019s on the other side.\u201d I shut my eyes tight against the memory of his heated expression. What the hell was that about?</p><p>\u201cI assume he has his woman with him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I gave her a look and gazed off in their general direction. I couldn\u2019t see them through the wall of bodies between us, but knowing he was there made my skin tingle.</p><p>\u201cYes, and if I had to guess, I\u2019d say she\u2019s probably pretty ticked off right now,\u201d I said, scooping up a loaded chip.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, he just looked so\u2014\u201d What? Lost? Pissed? \u201cShe caught him watching us.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie\u2019s eyebrows raised a little over her glass. \u201cWatching you\u2014dance?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth, then closed it. \u201cIt sort of got a little cozy for one little second there.\u201d</p><p>She set her glass down with a thunk. \u201cWith Hayden?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge,\u201d I said, grimacing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t anything like that, just\u2014there for about two seconds, things probably looked a little blurry. It was stupid and we both laughed it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Noah saw the blurry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming so,\u201d I said, rubbing my temples. \u201cBy the murderous look on his face, I\u2019d assume something\u2014\u201d I stopped and blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cWhy would he be bothered with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wasn\u2019t?\u201d Ruthie offered, holding up a chip. \u201cMaybe he and Preppy Girl Barbie had a fight and he\u2019s pissed at her.\u201d</p><p>I pointed at her. \u201cThey most likely did have an altercation earlier today.\u201d I gave the quickie version of the gas station debacle earlier.</p><p>\u201cWell, there you go,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he was having murderous thoughts about you, that was probably why. So since he\u2019s actually trained to do that, you might want to steer clear,\u201d she said, giving me a cute smile and a head tilt.</p><p>I scrunched my nose at her in response and grabbed a jalape\u00f1o popper. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m eating this crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been binging all week. Are you pregnant?\u201d</p><p>I stopped mid-bite. \u201cDo you even know how not funny that is?\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>I excused myself to go get some water at the bar. Everything from my shoulders up felt like it might ignite if I rubbed two hairs together. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was stress, anxiety, or just an unfortunate hot flash, but I was pretty sure I could conjure up fire if I really put some thought into it. Plus, the margarita was getting too sweet for me, and our waitress seemed to only remember alcohol.</p><p>\u201cIn a glass or a bottle?\u201d the bartender asked.</p><p>I glanced down at the giant bin of ice and fantasized about plunging my head into it.</p><p>\u201cGlass with extra ice, please,\u201d I said.</p><p>I felt him before anything else. Before sight or smell or words could come into play. I felt the pull of Noah Ryan at my right before he ever even spoke.</p><p>\u201cQuite the little dancer you\u2019ve become,\u201d he said, the deep familiar voice unsettling me as it did every single time I\u2019d heard it. He caught the bartender\u2019s eye and held up his empty beer bottle and one finger. \u201cAnd a Sprite with ice, please.\u201d She smiled like her life depended on it, completely ditching my glass of ice to get his needs taken care of.</p><p>I smiled into the mirror behind the bar, finding it safer to look at him that way than the five inches between us.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I said. \u201cHaven\u2019t done that in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you learn that?\u201d</p><p>I thumbed behind me as if that would clear things up. \u201cHayden, actually.\u201d</p><p>Noah glanced behind us and looked at me, making me look him in the eye. \u201cHayden,\u201d he echoed. My stomach went to war as a tiny flicker of humor passed through his blue eyes. \u201cIs he another not-a-someone?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help the smirk that tugged at my lips at his memory of my description of Patrick. I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s more like a used-to-be-someone.\u201d The woman behind the bar came back with his beer and filled a glass with ice that wasn\u2019t for me. \u201cHayden\u2019s my ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s left cheek twitched. \u201cEx-husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I drummed my fingers on the bar, wishing she\u2019d hurry up with my glass of ice water.</p><p>\u201cYou dance like that with your ex?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>Like that. I grimaced as I cursed the fact that he kept catching me with my pants down. Someone squeezed in at the bar on the other side of him, nudging him sideways into me. I felt the heat of his arm through his shirt and my gauzy one, and my mouth went even drier.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2014wasn\u2019t what you think,\u201d I said, pointing to my glass emphatically as the woman came back with the sparkly Sprite. Hearing my words, I realized I\u2019d said something very similar about Patrick. Wanting to change the subject, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, by the way, about today at the pump. I didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t supposed to know.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it was my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you didn\u2019t get in too much trouble,\u201d I said, cutting another glance his way.</p><p>His face tightened a little and he handed the lady a ten and held up a hand to let her know to keep the change. \u201cIt\u2019s all good, Jules.\u201d</p><p>The woman grabbed my glass and stared at it as if she couldn\u2019t remember what she was supposed to do with it. \u201cIce please,\u201d I said, reminding her. She jumped into motion, smiling at Noah, scooping one scoop of ice into the glass. \u201cExtra?\u201d I reiterated, and she huffed out a breath as if that just put her over the top.</p><p>He could have walked on, but he didn\u2019t. He waited to walk with me. Why did he do that? I wanted to pour that whole glass on my head as I walked back to the table with Noah behind me. The look must have registered, because Ruthie clamped her lips together like she was ready to either laugh or beat him up. I reached for my chair to pull it out more but it moved out of my hand as Noah pulled it out for me. I paused and met Ruthie\u2019s eyes, wishing he\u2019d just go bring Shayna her damn Sprite and stay on the other side of the room.</p><p>\u201cRuthie,\u201d he said as I sat and he passed behind me.</p><p>She smiled up at him with a smart-assed head tilt. \u201cNoah.\u201d She nodded at the glass and beer he held expertly in one hand. \u201cNo waitress on your side?\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed with the urge to spar with her. He picked up her drink and took a swallow straight from the glass, licking the salt from his lips as she shot him ice daggers with her glare.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>He set down the glass with an almost-smile and walked around the outskirts of the dance floor till he disappeared behind all the groping bodies.</p><p>\u201cGod, he\u2019s such an ass,\u201d Ruthie said, grabbing a napkin to wipe his cooties off her glass. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s still seventeen years old in an old man\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled in spite of myself, chewing on ice to cool off. \u201cYou think he looks like an old man?\u201d</p><p>She gave me a look. \u201cHell, no, he looks like he was carved from stone. Which is amazing considering he left here looking like a pole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess the Navy finds things that weren\u2019t there before,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was supposedly a badass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you just be careful,\u201d she said, seriousness back in her tone.</p><p>I frowned, trying to pull her meaning. \u201cOf\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah.\u201d</p><p>I started to protest, but then I took a deep breath and looked around. I knew what she was saying. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Ruthie. We\u2019re all adults now.\u201d Hadn\u2019t I just said that to Hayden? \u201cAnd he\u2019s settling in here with Shayna.\u201d The words were rancid on my tongue.</p><p>\u201cMmm, yeah, I can see how settled he is,\u201d she said, sarcasm lacing her tone. \u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to bet she can see it, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We\u2019d had Patrick, Hayden, and Noah so far, and I felt better knowing there was no one else to crash our party. I was fresh out of exes\u2014not that Patrick was an ex, although he probably qualified now. Ruthie\u2019s husband was hours into zombies and I couldn\u2019t see him dropping by the Grille.</p><p>Ruthie and I had gone out on the floor for a line dance I no more knew how to do than that last chip on my plate did. What I thought was a brilliant strategy of staying in the middle so that Noah wouldn\u2019t see me didn\u2019t really pan out. There weren\u2019t enough of us out there for anyone to hide, and he zeroed in on me like white on rice.</p><p>Not as heavily as before. Just with his eyes, on and off, as he chatted with Shayna. Then he\u2019d look away and give her his full attention. Of course, I might not have noticed it so much if I weren\u2019t looking at him.</p><p>An old friend of Ruthie\u2019s stopped her on the way back to our table, and I kept going. The relative aloneness at the table was nice\u2014in a way. I could regroup and adjust. I saw a few people I could go say hello to, but I didn\u2019t want to. My mind still reeled from the news about Becca, and the few times I saw Hayden he looked more and more irritated. My guess was that his liquid cure-all wasn\u2019t working. Becca texted me twice with updates, one being a picture of the whole group of them. Two were boys, and I zoomed the photo up, studying them and sending them subliminal warnings. All I could think of was history repeating itself. It was not going to be a pleasant conversation with her, and every angle I thought up ended in a screaming fight.</p> <p>A slow song came on, and as I glanced around to make sure Hayden wasn\u2019t gunning for me, I got an eyeful of Noah and Shayna on the dance floor instead. Wrapped in each other\u2019s arms, her head tilted back to smile up at him lovingly.</p><p>I was hit with a gut kick and a burn that set my whole chest on fire. I looked away and gulped down my third glass of water, refusing to watch that. Look away, idiot. He\u2019s not yours to get possessive over.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered, turning back in spite of myself. They were laughing about something, and he tucked a stray piece of perfect hair behind her ear. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, bolting to my feet, needing something to do.</p><p>I walked to the bar, my skin feeling like it had taken on a life of its own.</p><p>\u201cCan I order food here?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d the lady said. \u201cDo you need a menu?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDessert\u2014what\u2019s the best you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blackberry cobbler,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work,\u201d I said, nearly bouncing on my toes. I couldn\u2019t be still. \u201cTwo of them, with ice cream.\u201d</p><p>I showed her what table and made my way slowly back to it, taking in the view and understanding with a start what Noah\u2019s expression had been about when he saw Hayden and me. Not that it made a bit of sense. We had nothing to be jealous about and no rights to each other\u2014but at that one second I wanted Ruthie to come sit on me before I ended up yanking a pregnant woman out of his arms. I wrapped my arms around my middle as if that would ease the burn, but all that did was make me feel the trembling more. What the hell.</p><p>\u201cStop watching,\u201d Ruthie\u2019s voice said to my right as she perched back on her chair.</p> <p>I jumped, startled, and twisted around to face her, feeling like an errant child. I grabbed a coaster and fanned myself with it.</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d I said, emotional laughter bubbling up that threatened to turn to tears. \u201cWhat is this? I\u2019m forty-three years old, not fourteen. Why am I reacting like an adolescent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s where you left off,\u201d she said. \u201cYou two never got to see each other as adults. Or with other people.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a slow breath. \u201cWell, this sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can go, Jules,\u201d she said, chuckling. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to stay here so you torture yourself all night.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo. You said not to let him run me away, and I\u2019m not.\u201d I held up my chin and smiled at her. \u201cBesides, she\u2019s pregnant, she\u2019ll want to go home soon.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie laughed. \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the way, we have dessert coming.\u201d</p> <p>Noah being back in town was going to turn me into a hippopotamus.</p><p>An hour later when they were still there, my resolve began to wane. And as I left the ladies\u2019 room for the fourth time after fifty glasses of water and three margaritas, another slam to the midsection hit me. Yes, Noah and Shayna were on the dance floor again, but they already had been. I was getting immune to that.</p><p>It was the song that started playing.</p><p>\u201cOh, holy hell.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I was never one to go wiggy over a song with an old flame. Hayden and I had a song, and I quietly recognized it every time I heard it and that was that. I even kind of remembered that Noah and I had an actual song we\u2019d danced to at a high school dance once, but that one never really registered with me.</p><p>The day our baby was born was crazy. It was drizzling and cold and confusing. We\u2019d just had an argument at the park and when my water broke we lost our minds. The scrambling we did to get to the car in what then became a downpour was insane. To this day I remember thinking the sky was crying for us. For the decision I hadn\u2019t completely made yet.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Linny\u2019s tank is on fumes,\u201d Noah said, pounding the steering wheel. \u201cI meant to get gas before I picked you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have time\u2014I think,\u201d I stuttered, trying to remember what I\u2019d read in the book I\u2019d checked out from the library. \u201cNo contractions yet.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s right hand went to my belly, my rain-soaked T-shirt stretched across it. \u201cI\u2019ll get you there safe, Little Bit,\u201d he said, his affectionate name for it making my eyes burn for the fortieth time that day. \u201cWe just need to get some gas first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need my bag,\u201d I said. \u201cI prepacked everything like the book said. I can\u2019t go to the hospital without my bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll call your mom when we get there,\u201d he said, trying to see through the rain. \u201cShe can bring it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we can swing by my house, Noah, it\u2019s right\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, taking his hand off my belly and gripping the steering wheel with both hands. \u201cPlease, Jules, for once can we do something on our own without your mother? Can we do this on our own?\u201d He darted glances at me between watching the road and pulling out of Copper Falls onto the highway. \u201cShe\u2019ll take over and push me aside, you know she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, feeling unsure of everything. I\u2019d never felt so unprepared and insecure in my life. The only thing I\u2019d done right was pack that damn bag, and now I didn\u2019t even have that.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, baby. Please?\u201d Noah said, grabbing my hand and squeezing it. My hands felt like ice against his warm ones, and the warmth spread like honey through me. \u201cLet me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed back. \u201cI do trust you, Noah. I\u2019m just scared.\u201d I rubbed my free hand over my belly, where the baby shoved a foot against my palm. \u201cThis is all happening\u2014like right now.\u201d</p><p>He shoved a cassette tape into the deck in the dash. \u201cListen to this, Jules. Really listen to it.\u201d He pressed a button to advance it a few tracks, and then grabbed the steering wheel to turn the car off the highway as a gas station came into view.</p><p>Tonight\u2019s the night we\u2019ll make history . . . honey, you and I . . .</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Styx,\u201d I said, cringing as a tightness grabbed hold of my midsection like giant hands squeezing. \u201cI know this song\u2014shit, Noah, something really is happening.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face was whiter than normal as he looked my way and swallowed hard. \u201cOkay, baby, just\u2014here, hold my hand. I\u2019m stopping up here for gas and then just a few more minutes up the highway.\u201d</p><p>There was a line of cars waiting at the station, making us the third one back, and I closed my eyes and squeezed his hand as we sat in silence listening to Styx sing about how even when you think it\u2019s the worst of times, that taking on life together made it the best of times.</p><p>Another contraction pulled everything inward, like my body was trying to wring the baby out of me. I shut my eyes tighter and the music filled all my senses as Noah inched the car closer.</p><p>\u201cOw, damn it,\u201d I said, hearing the tears in my voice. I didn\u2019t want to be scared. I thought I was good with everything. I thought I could handle it. But there with it happening, with it actually happening, I wanted to run. \u201cNoah, hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he whispered. I looked his way and he was breathing as hard as I was, probably just as scared. We made it up to the pump and he slammed the car in Park and jumped out. \u201cHang in there, Jules, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He literally sprinted into the store, and I absorbed the sound of the rain pelting everything around me. I rubbed my belly and took breaths like I\u2019d seen the women do on television. I never took Lamaze, my mom said it was a bunch of bunk, but now I could see where it might at least be distracting.</p><p>Hot tears fell down my cheeks as I worked my fingers over the wet fabric and felt feet or hands or elbows or something small pushing my stomach into contorted shapes as whoever was inside rolled over.</p><p>\u201cI want to be your momma, baby,\u201d I whispered, my voice shaking. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how. Right now, I just want mine.\u201d Sobs worked their way up. \u201cDo you know how much I love you?\u201d</p><p>Noah ran back to the car and crammed the pump into the gas tank as fast as he could, pumping ten dollars in. Then he jumped in and handed me a roll of wintergreen LifeSavers.</p><p>\u201cI know they always soothe your stomach when you\u2014\u201d He stopped short as he caught sight of my face. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Shit, Jules, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll hurry.\u201d He jerked the car out of the parking lot and onto the feeder road on two wheels.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014it\u2019s not that,\u201d I sputtered. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014freaking out a little.\u201d</p><p>Noah blew out a giant breath as he got back on the highway. \u201cBaby, I know. I know you\u2019re scared, I am too.\u201d He glanced my way. \u201cBut it\u2019s just like that song. You think this is the worst right now, but it\u2019s really the best. I mean, yeah, it\u2019s crazy but we\u2019re\u2014we\u2019re starting our own family here. Right now.\u201d He laughed out loud, sounding so proud. \u201cMy God, I\u2019m about to be a dad.\u201d He brought my hand to his lips and kissed it, kissing the little engagement ring that adorned my finger. \u201cAnd you\u2019re gonna be a great mom, Jules. Who cares that we\u2019re starting early? I\u2019ll stand with you and Little Bit till the end of time, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered, feeling the invisible hand squeeze my middle again. \u201cOh, God, this is so not cool, Noah,\u201d I said in a grimace as I automatically doubled forward.</p><p>Five minutes that felt like five hours later, we screeched into the emergency room drive and Noah jumped out of the car and ran around. He opened my door and took my hand, pulling me to my feet. His blue eyes glittered with excited tears.</p><p>\u201cThis is it, Jules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d I said back. I wrapped my arms around his neck for dear life. \u201cI love you, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, baby,\u201d he said, hugging me back. \u201cI\u2019ll always love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said into my hair. \u201cHoly shit, look!\u201d</p><p>I backed up and followed his eyes upward. The rain had turned into snow. Oh, my God, snow was falling. Here.</p><p>Noah started laughing and cradled my face in his hands, blinking fast. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing, baby, it\u2019s a sign. This is our miracle.\u201d</p><p>I blinked upward as Noah knelt and kissed my belly. \u201cOur miracle.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes against the memory as I found myself on a darkened edge of the room, gripping the back of a chair. It had been years since that song spoke to me. I\u2019d avoided it every time it came on the radio at first, and then when I moved on to darker, angrier music to numb things it wasn\u2019t a consideration.</p><p>Over the years it was rarer to hear it, and when I did I usually changed the station and moved on. It wasn\u2019t part of the last-moments-as-a-family montage like the painting and the bench were. It stood for the black moments that made up my mind. And I didn\u2019t need to revisit that to remember them.</p><p>A back door exit caught my eye as a couple of women came inside from what I assumed was a smoke break. That\u2019s what I needed. A smoke break. Ruthie had left the table again when I looked, finding other people to talk to as I kept ditching her, so I made a beeline for the door. Pushing through it, cold icy air hit my face, making me gasp with the contrast of it.</p><p>I welcomed it\u2014sucked in big gulps of it, hoping it would freeze up everything inside of me. Numb everything. As the door settled back in place, the song and its taunting lyrics were muffled. The dual visual of Noah and Shayna locked up and Noah and I standing in the falling snow fizzled a bit with the icy wind. The cold and the darkness from no lighting wrapped around me as I sat in one of two old plastic chairs set out there against the brick walls. I felt like I could breathe easy for the first time that evening, and I leaned over, elbows on my knees, resting my forehead against my palms.</p><p>I considered myself a strong, independent woman. I never saw myself as weak or needy or weepy. I couldn\u2019t stand those types of women. But it was too much. Upside down and sideways. My head spun through zinging thoughts of Becca, Hayden, Noah and that damn song, even Patrick and how I\u2019d insulted him.</p><p>Hot tears burned my eyes, and I wiped them away as they turned cold on my cheeks. I had to get it together and quit this. I was better than this.</p><p>The sound from inside barreled out to me as the door opened again, and I tried to shrink against the brick in the dark, sniffing and wiping the wetness from my face. The aroma of beer and fried food wafted on the air.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to groan at the familiar voice as he walked closer. I quickly wiped the remnants of my tears away and sat up straighter, feeling delirium coming on. I chuckled as I swiped under my eyes one last time.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a GPS on me or something?\u201d</p><p>Noah knelt directly in front of me, making my pulse jump up a notch. \u201cI\u2019m not that crafty,\u201d he said, his voice low.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>One shoulder shrugged slightly. \u201cWell, maybe.\u201d Even in the dark, I could see the hint of a grin tug at the corners of his lips. \u201cBut, no. I just wanted to check on you, I saw you come out here.\u201d</p><p>After \u201cThe Best of Times\u201d knocked you on your ass is what he didn\u2019t add on to that sentence. I was surprised he\u2019d noticed me at all, all locked up with Shayna like he was. Or that there was the possibility he even connected the two. He might not remember that moment in the car at all.</p><p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d I muttered, running a hand over my face, feeling wrung out. \u201cIs there anywhere that you won\u2019t be? Because I haven\u2019t found that place yet.\u201d</p><p>The grin left, and a cold that had nothing to do with the air emanated off him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, here\u2019s one,\u201d he growled, pushing to his feet and regret flooded through me.</p><p>\u201cNoah, wait.\u201d I reached out before logic could form a plan and grabbed his arm, making us both suck in a breath as it slipped to his wrist and then his hand. We both stared at the union, and his fingers wrapped around mine. That breath fell right out of me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, the words barely making it out of my mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>He slowly lowered back to one knee until we were eye level again, resting an elbow on my knee and not letting go of my hand. His expression was cloudy and troubled, his jaw tight, but all I could think of was the feel of his hand around mine.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, his voice gruff. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a couple of beats before they opened and burned into me. \u201cThis is harder than I thought it would be.\u201d</p><p>The proximity of his body, his arm on my knee, his hand shooting heat through mine had me dizzy with the stupids. I needed order, structure, someone to tell me to hold the crazy in, because right at that moment we weren\u2019t grown-up responsible people. We were back in the place where we were us and knew how to be with each other, and I wanted to let everything sensible go.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of years,\u201d I said instead, my voice sounding hoarse and scratchy. Trying to find the logic that had to be floating around if I could just snag it. \u201cEverything got put away\u2014doors locked up tight.\u201d I paused and watched his eyes go soft. \u201cBut now you fall out of the sky and knock all those doors open. And suddenly I\u2019m not sure where I am half the time.\u201d</p><p>It was ballsy to admit that. It put me on very uneven ground. Shaky and vulnerable and wide open for him to scoff and blow me off and leave me looking like a fool. I never put myself in such a precarious position, and I couldn\u2019t imagine why I was being so foolish now.</p><p>I felt his thumb move across my hand and warmth shot to all kinds of places it shouldn\u2019t. He looked down at my hand in his with something I could only describe as heaviness.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>I was getting light-headed, and I hadn\u2019t had near enough alcohol to justify that. I needed normal back. I needed to not want to wrap myself around him and do things we\u2019d regret.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you out here with me, Noah?\u201d I asked, knowing the direction I needed to go to get us back thinking right. \u201cYou have a pregnant girlfriend\u2014\u201d I stopped and licked my lips, feeling the burn in my chest again and refusing to allow it. \u201cA pregnant fianc\u00e9e out there,\u201d I corrected. \u201cSitting alone, not able to drink, while you come track me down. That can\u2019t bode well for your evening.\u201d</p><p>He let go of my hand and scrubbed at his eyes, and I immediately missed the contact.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lighten it up. \u201cYou know, those pregnant emotions are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember the emotions, Jules. I\u2019ve had a pregnant fianc\u00e9e before.\u201d</p><p>Everything left me. All the words of wisdom, patience, sadness, chemistry, even anger\u2014it all left me. I had nothing to say back as my lips moved but thoughts were whisked away with the icy cold. I shivered, realizing I hadn\u2019t even felt it since he\u2019d come outside. But the whiplash changing from the earlier tender moment was quite palpable.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d I whispered finally. \u201cAt least up until the pregnant part was over.\u201d</p><p>I saw the flash in his eyes, felt it as he pushed away from me and to his feet.</p><p>\u201cNot my doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said, rising to my feet as well. I stepped away from the chair to put some space between us. \u201cBecause I\u2019m pretty sure I didn\u2019t leave to go sail the ocean blue\u2014\u201d</p><p>He walked slowly into me, backing me to the bricks until I gasped. He braced one hand against the brick wall. \u201cYou have no\u2014idea\u2014what I did,\u201d he said, just inches from my face, his voice low and raw.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d I whispered, my voice shaking. Under the circumstances, I thought that was pretty remarkable. I held my chin up, refusing to back down even when he was so close I could have licked him. \u201cAnd whose fault was that? You knew how to find me. I never left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to,\u201d he said. \u201cYour mother did it for you when she convinced you to bail on us\u2014\u201d he said, his voice clipped. \u201cTo bail on our son.\u201d</p><p>My entire body went hot, my skin prickling with the fire from a million tiny flames. The conversation we\u2019d never had over twenty years earlier was boring into me with what I knew to be hard blue anger, but in the dark just looked black.</p><p>I pushed against him, hoping he\u2019d move, but it was like attempting to move a boulder. Blinded through a shimmer of tears, I pushed up so that our noses nearly touched.</p><p>\u201cAnd you bailed on me,\u201d I said through my teeth.</p><p>My heart pounding in my ears, I stepped under his raised arm and pushed past him, yanking the door open and letting the warmth and barrage of sound sensations envelope me. I swallowed tears back and made a beeline for my table, wishing for crap to eat. I nearly sang with joy to see a bowl of cashews on our table, and Ruthie walking back to join me.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked, mirroring what Noah had asked me earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I breathed, knowing I wasn\u2019t. Knowing that she knew I wasn\u2019t, too. I dabbed under my eyes with a napkin and grabbed a handful of nuts, not even caring for once if they\u2019d been freshly opened or if five hundred other patrons had pawed through them.</p><p>\u201cNoah just walked back in the same door,\u201d she said warily.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and I saw her gaze follow him before returning to mine. \u201cDidn\u2019t go well, I\u2019m guessing?\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and blew out a slow breath to return my heart rate to normal. The heat radiating off my skin would take a little longer.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said, fanning myself with a coaster and forcing a smile. \u201cSo tell me about you and Becca\u2019s conversation. What did you say when she told you that?\u201d</p><p>Ruthie\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cO\u2014kay. When did we get back here? I thought you wanted to talk about anything else.\u201d</p><p>I pushed another handful of nuts in my mouth and proceeded to talk around them.</p><p>\u201cTurns out, it\u2019s the sanest subject of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The girl had freakish stamina. When I was pregnant\u2014both times\u2014I had trouble staying up past eight o\u2019clock. She looked just as perky at eleven as she did at seven, whereas I was fading, big-time.</p><p>I was ready to go\u2014had been since that little exchange outside\u2014but I refused to let a pregnant woman outlast me. I didn\u2019t care if she was thirteen years younger.</p><p>While the people-watching was interesting enough, including a brief wardrobe malfunction from an inebriated couple groping on the dance floor, the crowd began to thin. The only-here-for-dinner crowd was falling out to go catch a movie or have sober sex, while the true partiers were holding out for the drunken variety.</p><p>Or in my case, holding out for a Sprite-drinking pregnant woman to leave.</p><p>\u201cUm, what\u2019s\u2014\u201d Ruthie began, narrowing her eyes to something across the room. \u201cThat can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>I followed her gaze through the handful of remaining dancers on the floor and my stomach twisted up. \u201cOh, shit,\u201d I said, pushing off the stool.</p><p>Hayden had approached Noah and Shayna\u2019s table and appeared to be asking them both questions with a grim expression. Shayna visibly backed up a little, looking wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d Ruthie said, patting the table at my side. \u201cThey\u2019re men. They have to do the whole dick-swinging thing. Just wait\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words were cut off by our unified gasp as Noah stood up quickly, putting the two men in that unmistakable stance.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I said, my feet already propelling me forward. I could hear Ruthie behind me muttering curse words as we wound our way through the oblivious gropers, reaching their table just in time to hear Noah ask him to leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Judging by the edge to his voice filtered through his teeth, it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d made that request.</p><p>Hayden was laughing in his face. And stupid drunk.</p><p>\u201cHayden, what are you doing?\u201d I said, rounding the table to get to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I mouthed to Shayna, who smiled politely.</p><p>\u201cJules!\u201d Hayden said, his eyes lighting up like we were all at a party. \u201cWe were just talking about you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>He slung an arm around me and I tried to use that to move us both along and away from their table, but it didn\u2019t work that way. Noah\u2019s eyes were dark and menacing, and I could only imagine what Hayden had mouthed off about.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that these two are having a baby?\u201d Hayden said loudly. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Hayden,\u201d I said, trying in vain to move him. He was surprisingly solid for a drunk.</p><p>\u201cJust like we had a kid, Julianna,\u201d he said, his words slowing. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m sure your kid\u2019ll be perfect,\u201d he said to Shayna, who darted a glance from me to the table and back to Noah. \u201cNot like our daughter. I mean, she used to be. When she was born and had all that hair and perfect little fingers,\u201d he said. I stared at him, mortified. \u201cBut now she wants to chop her hair sideways, dress like a freak, and have sex with God knows who.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHayden!\u201d I pinched him in the side, hoping he\u2019d feel it. He didn\u2019t. \u201cY\u2019all, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I felt my eyes well up.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Noah muttered, shaking his head. \u201cHave some dignity, man. Go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut yours won\u2019t be like that, sweetheart,\u201d Hayden said, leaning toward Shayna, who scooted back more. \u201cBecause Jules just had me. You\u2019ve got Superman here.\u201d Hayden clapped Noah on the shoulder, which he shoved off with a jerk of his arm. \u201cWhat could be more perfect than the man everyone wants.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, wishing the floor to swallow him whole.</p><p>\u201cNo one could ever live up to you,\u201d Hayden said, refocusing his eyes on Noah. I got the distinct impression he\u2019d just forgotten about Becca in that split second and was on another course entirely. \u201cNot the perfect ghost of Noah Ryan past,\u201d he continued on a chuckle. \u201cDidn\u2019t matter that I stuck around to raise my kid\u2014\u201d</p><p>Everyone moved at once. Noah stepped forward with lightning speed and I tried to move between them. Shayna\u2019s stool scooted backward as she jumped to her feet. Ruthie hopped sideways to get out of the way.</p> <p>Hayden had the idea all mixed up in his riddled state, and I knew it, and Noah knew it, but it triggered something primal that was already touchy.</p><p>\u201cNoah, don\u2019t, he\u2019s drunk,\u201d I yelled, turning my back to him and pushing against Hayden, dimly aware that we were developing an audience. \u201cStop this, damn it!\u201d I yelled up into his face.</p><p>\u201cLet him come, if he\u2019s such a badass,\u201d Hayden slurred, wrapping an arm around my neck possessively. Even drunk I could feel every muscle in his torso tensed and tight, wound and ready for a fight. It was an old hurt with him, his insecurity over Noah. His feeling that I never gave my heart to him completely. I thought it was a buried subject. Clearly, not so much. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll show you once and for all the difference between a real man and a memory.\u201d</p><p>As he said it, I felt Noah\u2019s body against my back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there, buddy,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cHayden\u2014\u201d I pleaded, but my voice was cut off as he pushed Noah back, jostling me in the process. His arm around me tightened and I wrestled against him. \u201cHayden, stop it!\u201d</p><p>As Noah moved forward again, Hayden\u2019s awareness of me morphed into more of an annoyance\u2014something in the way of what he wanted. His grip on me turned into leverage to fling me aside, and like something in a slow-motion action scene I saw an empty table coming my way. Or more like it saw me coming its way.</p><p>Ruthie yelped as I crashed into it, and it probably looked and sounded worse than it was, as silverware and a metal napkin holder banged to the floor with me.</p> <p>That was it.</p><p>In time that didn\u2019t seem possible, Noah lunged at Hayden and spun him on the spot, wrenching his arm behind him and planting his face on the table. With his other hand he yanked Hayden\u2019s head up by the hair so that he was sure to see me, and leaned down, his face contorted with something unrecognizable to me.</p><p>\u201cThat your idea of a real man, asshole?\u201d he growled into his ear, his voice seething. \u201cThrowing her around?\u201d</p><p>Ruthie and Shayna rushed to either side of me, taking an arm.</p><p>Hayden\u2019s eyes slowly adjusted on me, still reeling from the shock of moving so fast and not seeing it coming. I saw the dawning in his expression.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d never hurt her,\u201d he said, his voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cNo, you just wear her like a trophy,\u201d Noah said, barking in his ear. Which wasn\u2019t really true, but my current position on the floor wasn\u2019t the place to pipe up on that. \u201cBeat down her dreams so far that she doesn\u2019t even remember she had them.\u201d</p><p>What? My head spun, wondering where that came from.</p><p>\u201cWas that just your thumb on her?\u201d Noah hissed in his ear. \u201cOr did you join forces with her mother on that?\u201d</p><p>I scrambled to my feet ahead of Shayna and Ruthie\u2019s helping hands, the words burning in my ears.</p><p>\u201cNoah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I said. \u201cLet him go.\u201d</p><p>He yanked on Hayden\u2019s hair a little harder, pulling his head into an awkward position. \u201cFeel like a real man now? Get your point across?\u201d</p><p>Hayden\u2019s face was blood red, and there were angry tears in his eyes. He was too drunk to really know the scene he\u2019d caused, but not drunk enough to not feel the embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d I repeated, which fell on deaf ears. I wrapped both hands around his arm and tugged, putting my face right next to his. \u201cNoah!\u201d</p><p>His head jerked in my direction, and the eyes that met mine were glazed over. Realization hit a second later, and he stood upright again, moving me behind him with one hand before releasing his grip on Hayden.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked under his breath, and I nodded.</p><p>Hayden jerked upward and stumbled sideways, searching for dignity and anonymity at the same time. I grabbed his arm and turned him around so we could walk away. All I wanted was away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bitch about your daughter or trash her in public,\u201d Noah said, his voice thick with simmering aggression. Hayden tensed and paused mid-step but didn\u2019t turn around to face him. \u201cBe glad you\u2019ve gotten to know her at all.\u201d</p><p>Heat flashed from my neck to my scalp on the stab, and I looked away as his gaze landed on me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go find your buddies,\u201d I said to Hayden, wondering where they\u2019d been for the floor show.</p><p>He pulled his arm free, refusing to look at me. I knew he was horribly humiliated, and horrified that he\u2019d pushed me down. Even in his current state, he was coherent enough to remember that. Never since I\u2019d known him had he ever gotten physical with me, and I\u2019d definitely seen him a lot worse off.</p><p>\u201cThey left,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThey left you here?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, running fingers through hair that was sticking up in all directions. \u201cI met them here.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a breath. \u201cWell, you aren\u2019t driving.\u201d I glanced at Ruthie and she nodded. It was time to call it. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie took over walking Hayden out while I paid our bill. When I chanced a look toward their table again, Shayna was picking things up to leave as well, and Noah wasn\u2019t around. She looked distracted and distant. I walked back over there and smiled politely the way I\u2019d come to expect from her, and she touched my arm.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, sounding genuine.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m\u2014really sorry he came to hassle you. He\u2019s going to be so mortified tomorrow when he remembers this.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head with a smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize, Jules. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>Kinda was.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was my ex-husband being a douche, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>She smiled but her eyes didn\u2019t, and the hands that shouldered her bag trembled a little. \u201cWell, Noah didn\u2019t have to rise to the bait, either,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was his choice.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow, remembering the flash reaction. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Noah get so\u2014\u201d I stopped. \u201cBut then I\u2019ve never seen him be an adult before, so what do I know?\u201d I said, attempting a chuckle that fell short.</p><p>\u201cHe has a hot fuse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure the military created some of that, but he also has a lot of baggage.\u201d She looked down and palmed her still-flat belly and then looked back up at me with those same distracted, distant eyes. \u201cAnd he wears that baggage twenty-four-seven, so I\u2019m used to it pissing him off on occasion.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what she meant by that, but something in me wanted to put her at ease. She looked troubled. And was likable, damn it.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry that Hayden ruined your evening.\u201d And me. And Noah\u2019s baggage. I glanced around at the crowd that was left, wondering if any of them were regulars at the diner. God, Johnny Mack would have a field day with gossip like this. \u201cHopefully Noah\u2019s dad won\u2019t get wind of it and this can all die down.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled at that. \u201cHe\u2019s quite the character.\u201d</p><p>There was a definition.</p><p>\u201cQuite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, even Noah thinks he\u2019s acting weird,\u201d she said. \u201cI told him that he\u2019s just been gone too long to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d I said, moving as I spoke. I spotted Noah coming from the restroom and didn\u2019t want questions. Or advice. Or resolutions. Or pity. I didn\u2019t want any more conversation with him, period. \u201cHe\u2019s just odd. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and that time it was real, transforming her face into rainbows and sunshine. I said my good-bye and made my way to the door around the long way so that I wouldn\u2019t pass him. I caught his look across the room anyway. I couldn\u2019t read it, but it lit my skin up.</p><p> But he wasn\u2019t walking to me. He was walking to Shayna. I had to admit, I could see the attraction. She was genuine, and sweet, and beautiful. And impossible to despise.</p><p>I, on the other hand, was walking to the car to bring home my drunk and slightly obnoxious ex-husband. I was one lucky lady.</p><p>He was leaned up against Ruthie\u2019s car when I got outside, with his arms crossed and his lips in a tight line.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t get in,\u201d Ruthie said, throwing her arms up. \u201cI give up, he\u2019s too big for me to shove in, and these heels aren\u2019t spiky enough to poke holes,\u201d she said with a smirk and a head tilt.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d I said, leaving no room for argument. \u201cYou\u2019re going home. I\u2019m going home. This night has officially kicked my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to push you, Jules,\u201d he said, his voice belying his stony expression.</p><p>I met his eyes, and they looked worried. \u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut if you\u2019d just kept your mouth shut it would have never come to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to meet him.\u201d</p><p>I sighed and closed my eyes, disgusted. \u201cAnd a handshake and a hello wouldn\u2019t do it for you?\u201d I rubbed at my face and opened the front passenger door since he was leaning against the back one. \u201cGet. In.\u201d</p><p>He gave me one last imploring look, and got in, all his puffed up-ness deflating in defeat.</p><p>I got in the back, and Hayden was snoring before we even made it to the highway.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>My eyes felt gritty and heavy, the result of staring at my bedroom ceiling instead of sleeping. It had crisscrossed beams that made a cool pattern, but not that cool. My brain just wouldn\u2019t shut down.</p><p>Becca had made her curfew, which normally would have me feeling all kinds of happy toward her, but I wasn\u2019t finding the happy. Not with her, not with her dad, not with Noah. Not even with myself when I thought about how unfair I\u2019d been to Patrick.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t an emotional attachment, no, I didn\u2019t allow myself those. But I did like him. He was funny and witty and fun to be with. He was a good guy, and I\u2019d been a real bitch. I wasn\u2019t proud.</p><p>Becca, however, kept coming back to the forefront. Most of the night I\u2019d spent working out the scenario. Working on my initial approach. It wasn\u2019t going to go well, I knew that instinctively, and once she was pissed she would tune out everything else. Therefore, anything I needed her to soak up had to be up front.</p><p>Becca, I love you. There\u2019s more to protection than birth control. Condoms protect your life.</p><p>Yeah, no.</p><p>Do you love this boy? Because having sex will affect all of you, not just your body.</p><p>Becca was a savvy girl, and unfortunately had inherited my ability to spot bullshit from a mile off. While all of my points were valid, none of them completely covered my real agenda in the two actual sentences she might hear. Which was basically Having sex before you\u2019re ready and with someone you don\u2019t actually love or even know all that well just to get it over with is a bad idea, and, oh, yeah, you can catch a life-threatening disease or end up pregnant with life-altering decisions at the age of seventeen.</p><p>Deep breath.</p><p>If only I could do that. Write it in a card, or better yet, text it to her. That would increase the likelihood of it being read.</p><p>I swung my legs down and rubbed my tired eyes, thinking orange juice sounded good and knowing we didn\u2019t have any. I wondered if I should send her to the store before she got angry with me or just do without. She wouldn\u2019t be up yet anyway, since it was only eight o\u2019clock on a Saturday.</p><p>I trudged downstairs to make coffee and was surprised to see her curled up on one of the couches, pillows piled around her, reading a book.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re up early,\u201d I said.</p><p>She looked up with a yawn. \u201cHad a scary dream so I thought I\u2019d come down here and read.\u201d</p><p>I felt the old heart tug. \u201cAnd the pillow brigade?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cMy protection against the evil forces.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, heading around the kitchen bar to the coffeepot. \u201cI remember the days when you\u2019d come jump in bed with me after a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I didn\u2019t consider that.\u201d</p><p>It was an easy morning, no animosity, no drama, no attitude. Why did I want to go and ruin that with parenting? I rounded the kitchen island to get the coffee going, knowing full well she hadn\u2019t been that helpful.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you reading?\u201d</p><p>Becca held up a copy of The Great Gatsby.</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cOn purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor school,\u201d she explained. \u201cSupposed to be done by Monday.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cAnd you started it\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d she said on a sigh that lent itself much better to the attitude I knew would be coming.</p><p>\u201cAh. Good luck with that.\u201d</p><p>I got the coffee gurgling and just stood there, not quite knowing where to begin. Yes, I did. Of course I knew where to begin, I just didn\u2019t want to begin. I was operating on no sleep and too much drama and wasn\u2019t in the mood to dive off into a battle of wills. Not that there was anything saying I couldn\u2019t wait to battle it out later. I didn\u2019t have to kick off the morning with it.</p><p>I perched on the armrest of a sofa, not wanting to invest in complete comfort till I had my steaming mug in my hand.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was your night?\u201d I asked. \u201cDidn\u2019t get to talk to you last night.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows, mocking me. \u201cYes, I beat you home, missy.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled and rubbed my eyes, remembering the drama of bringing Hayden home and how he kept hugging and apologizing at the door.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Regular party animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you and Aunt Ruthie have fun?\u201d she asked, deterring off of herself.</p><p>I opened my mouth and closed it again. \u201cSort of,\u201d I said, finally. \u201cAt times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Becca said on a laugh, setting the book in her lap.</p><p>\u201cWell, the night had its moments,\u201d I said. \u201cGood and bad.\u201d</p><p>She gave me another haughty look. \u201cSounds like you were a party animal.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and laughed quietly. \u201cNo. Not those kinds of moments.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to tell her that her dad got stupid drunk and tried to brawl it out with my high school boyfriend, or any other highlights for that matter. \u201cWhat did you and your friends end up doing?\u201d</p><p>Becca shrugged and picked her book back up. \u201cWent to a movie, walked around the mall, just stuff.\u201d</p><p>Just stuff. Love that.</p><p>\u201cGet anything at the mall?\u201d I asked, knowing how to find the details if I wanted to.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that little kiosk by the food court with the leather stuff and jewelry? They had bracelets two for one, so I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d She grinned and held up her wrists to show off two beaded and braided leather strips. I got up to look closer and smiled.</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d I said. \u201cVery you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too,\u201d she said, smiling to herself.</p><p>I kissed her forehead and messed up her hair before I headed back to the kitchen for my coffee, batting around my options. On the one hand, I didn\u2019t want to ruin a good mood. On the other, being a parent sometimes just had to suck.</p><p>\u201cAre we donating to the clothes drive this year?\u201d she asked as I came back in.</p><p>I sighed, feeling that familiar Winter Carnival annoyance like a fly buzzing in my ear. Only this year, more so. I attributed that to Noah\u2019s return, stirring up things I\u2019d pushed down for years.</p><p>\u201cDo you have clothes you want to get rid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly so I can make room for new,\u201d she said with a cute little grin.</p><p>\u201cWell, as long as your priorities are in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asked to help with a float this year,\u201d she said. \u201cLizzy\u2019s mom and dad are doing one with their four-wheelers, like I think they are connecting them or something.\u201d</p><p>Of course they were. The Cleavers. On four-wheelers.</p><p>\u201cOh, cool, that\u2019ll be fun,\u201d I said, pretending it would be.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t we ever done that?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe could have done something with Dad\u2019s truck.\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019d rather be buried alive. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Bec, I guess we never jumped on it in time.\u201d How old would she be before that excuse stopped playing? \u201cGo through your clothes and get me a bag if you want to donate.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I sank onto the couch next to her with my coffee, sitting sideways to face her while pulling a pillow on my lap. Comfort moves. She put her book down again, looking at me questioningly.</p><p>\u201cSo, I heard that you have a new boyfriend,\u201d I said, a small smile in place, hoping to nail that let\u2019s-talk-girl-stuff ambiance.</p><p>The change in her eyes, however, told me I didn\u2019t. Or that girl stuff wasn\u2019t a place she wanted to go with me, at any rate. I saw the walls come up.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d she said, her voice edgy.</p><p>\u201cYes, and don\u2019t be mad at Ruthie,\u201d I said, tugging on her oversized T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would I be mad when someone lies to me? Can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s looking out for you, Bec,\u201d I said. \u201cShe felt that I needed to know what was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted to talk to my mother about it, I would have,\u201d she said, tossing her book on the coffee table. \u201cI thought I was talking to a friend that I could trust.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips as the dig hit home.</p><p>\u201cAunt Ruthie is a friend, Becca, but she\u2019s also an adult who knows that sometimes you have to make tough choices to take care of people you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she won\u2019t have to worry about that anymore,\u201d Becca said, pushing the blanket off her lap and swinging her pajama-clad legs down. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my crap to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecca\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Mom,\u201d she said, facing me with the most mature expression I\u2019d ever seen on her. \u201cOf all the people I thought I could trust to keep their mouth shut, it was her. Now I have nobody.\u201d</p><p>I flinched. \u201cExcuse the hell out of me? You have plenty of somebodies, Becca. You have Ruthie, you have Nana Mae, your dad, your friends\u2014me.\u201d I narrowed my eyes at her. \u201cYou always, always and forever have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if I\u2019m saying what you want to hear,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d I said, my mind frantically pulling at itself, wondering if it was. Something was eerily reminiscent.</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Mom,\u201d she said, getting up.</p><p>\u201cBecca, please, sit down,\u201d I said. At her look, I gestured to her seat.</p><p>Instead of sinking back down, she walked around the coffee table to the opposite sofa and sat, pulling her feet up to her chest and gazing absently at nothing.</p><p>It was going well.</p><p>\u201cLike it or not, sweetheart, you aren\u2019t an adult yet,\u201d I said, adjusting my position to face her. \u201cThere are things I need to know.\u201d At her silence, I took a swallow of coffee, relishing the burn on the way down. \u201cLike who this boy is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you already know that,\u201d she said flatly.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been seeing him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She closed her eyes and gave a tiny head shake, as if she couldn\u2019t believe the conversation. Seeing as I\u2019d felt that way the night before, I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of weeks,\u201d I repeated. \u201cAnd you\u2019re asking about birth control?\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her face and kept her hand partially covering her eyes. \u201cWe aren\u2019t talking about this,\u201d she said, as if to herself.</p><p>\u201cOh, but we are,\u201d I said, her attitude spiking mine. \u201cDo you know that safe sex isn\u2019t just about avoiding pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFully aware, actually,\u201d she said, still resting her face in her hand. \u201cThere are these balloon thingies. I think they\u2019re called condoms.\u201d</p><p>I swung my feet down and set my mug on the table with a thud, causing a tiny splash to spill over the edge.</p><p>\u201cYou have some nerve talking to me like that, little girl,\u201d I said, her mouth setting off my ire the way it always did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a little girl, Mom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, when you get snarky with me like you think I\u2019m your equal, Becca, that shows me just how little you still are,\u201d I said. My tone brought her hand from her face, and I saw the tiniest worry over what she might lose in her eyes. \u201cYou want to be treated like an almost-adult, act like one.\u201d</p><p>Both her hands went to her face on a deep sigh, then she dropped them. \u201cFine, what do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy keep this boy a big secret?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Then why not bring him over here? Introduce him.\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cSo you can put him through the Spanish Inquisition? No, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou totally do that,\u201d she countered. \u201cYou do that with my friends that I\u2019m not going to make out with, so God help the ones I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecca,\u201d I said, trying to keep my voice calm and rational. \u201cYou are considering something far beyond making out. Something that should be special with someone you love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Mom,\u201d she groaned. \u201cAre you seriously trying to sound like an old woman?\u201d</p><p>I gaped at her. \u201cAre you seriously trying to be a brainless twit? You want to throw yourself away just to say you\u2019ve done it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she muttered, pressing her forehead against her knees. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything. I was just asking some questions in case it came up.\u201d</p><p>Right.</p><p>\u201cWell, if he\u2019s someone you\u2019ll consider falling into bed with if the subject comes up, why don\u2019t you bring him around?\u201d I asked, knowing full well that wouldn\u2019t happen. Especially not now.</p><p>\u201cSo you can ask him a million questions?\u201d she said, raising her head. \u201cHover over us in case we accidentally kiss? Have a meltdown if we go upstairs to watch TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you won\u2019t go upstairs,\u201d I said, sitting back and pulling my feet under me.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course not,\u201d Becca said, melodrama now in full gear. \u201cBecause that\u2019s rule number 553 of the Julianna White book of etiquette. Never, under any circumstances, have a boy in your room. His sperm might jump out and infest you!\u201d</p><p>I dropped my head into my hand. \u201cBecca\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been a dream child for your parents,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you keep a log of your gold stars, too?\u201d</p><p>I looked up and stared at her, feeling my skin create a million goose bumps. \u201cNo,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cI was no dream child. And I\u2019m not expecting you to be. But when I find out that you are talking to someone else about sex when I didn\u2019t even know there was a guy in the picture, and then you tell me it\u2019s only been two weeks\u2014baby girl, I worry. Somewhere along the way, you got the idea that sex is all physical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, Mom,\u201d she said, rising to her feet. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. But that\u2019s what you hear because all you hear is you. This is exactly why I didn\u2019t come to you.\u201d She gestured around her. \u201cI didn\u2019t want a lecture on love and birds and bees. I\u2019m not stupid, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you said I was a brainless twit,\u201d she said, snatching her book from the table.</p><p>Of all the things I\u2019ve said in her life, that\u2019s what she remembered.</p><p>\u201cBec\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a five-year-old, either,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019d actually listen to me, and hear me for once, you\u2019d know that\u2014yes, okay, maybe I\u2019m asking questions and I\u2019m interested but I\u2019m also not an idiot. If I was an idiot, I wouldn\u2019t be asking about birth control.\u201d</p><p>I met her gaze and let a few beats pass. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see you do something foolish and ruin your plans, baby.\u201d</p><p>Becca let out a long breath and shook her head, walking up the stairs. \u201cWhose plans, Mom? Mine or yours?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saturdays were always my biggest days at the store, and at this time of year it jumped up to chaotic at times. Ruthie did a children\u2019s story time right before lunch, so many moms could bring their kids for an outing of stories, lunch at the diner, and dessert at the ice cream shop just down the sidewalk. Also, since everyone else with normal jobs had Saturdays off, many of them saved their holiday shopping time for the weekends.</p><p>And that was okay.</p><p>Normally.</p><p>Today, I wasn\u2019t in the mood. I knew Noah was next door, having seen his truck parked out front, and that knowledge sat like acid in my stomach. Too much had transpired the night before, and not just the fight. The moment we\u2019d had on the back patio had stirred my blood and gripped my heart, making me relive it on long loop over and over.</p> <p>You bailed on our son.</p><p>And Becca had me irritated, both at her and at myself. The things she\u2019d said had hit home, about being the perfect dream child with all my rules, and about my plans versus hers.</p><p>Dream child? Pregnant at seventeen was hardly a dream child, but she didn\u2019t know about that. I still didn\u2019t know how I\u2019d gotten that lucky, having grown up in the same town, but basically time dulls memories and no one cared much about two dumb kids who got themselves in a pickle. Especially when the child never showed up. Made it easy to forget, I guess. For them.</p><p>Nana Mae kept bending my ear about telling Becca, though, before someone suddenly grew a memory, and she was right. I knew she was right. The latest topic, however, made that a little awkward.</p><p>I had followed the rules before all that, though. Mostly. But they weren\u2019t mine. They were my mother\u2019s. Her way of keeping control and order in the life around her, and I guessed I\u2019d grown up to do the same.</p> <p>Sitting at her counter, in her bookstore, selling one gift certificate after another and watching her customers mill about while Ruthie acted out Brown Bear, Brown Bear in the corner amid a mob of little people\u2014and letting that realization settle over me like a blanket, my skin prickled all over. Whose life was I living? Mine or my mother\u2019s?</p><p>Whose plans, Mom? Mine or yours?</p><p>My clothes suddenly felt heavy and hot, and I got up and headed to the back break room for a bottle of water. I got the water, but the leftover Mississippi Mud in the fridge caught my eye as well, and I unwrapped the cellophane-covered plate and pulled out a gooey piece.</p><p>\u201cMmm-mygod,\u201d I mumbled around it as the heavenly comfort food excited my taste buds and put me in a chocolate state of Zen.</p><p>I heard it from the kitchen. The unmistakable sound of a cane against a wall. My Zen moment melted away with the chocolate down my throat, and I chugged the water on my way out to the sales floor.</p><p>Bam-bam.</p> <p>Feeling like everything inside me was riding on the edge, I fisted my hand and banged back. Pictures rattled on the wall around me and a bronze sign with the saying No better peace than right her clattered to the floor. I heard Ruthie\u2019s voice halt abruptly, and I turned to see her staring at me along with fifteen sets of little eyes and many of the parents.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>Bam.</p><p>That was it. I set my water bottle down on the counter and walked right out the front door, the bell jingling madly behind me. The brisk air hit me full-on, making me suck in a chest full of the cold, thick air, but it felt good. I wanted it to chill everything in me and freeze over.</p><p>Noah\u2019s truck was gone and I felt an odd mix of massive relief and the twinge of disappointment. When I pulled open the heavy diner door, warmth hit me again, coupled with the mouthwatering aroma of fried chicken.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t there for that. I couldn\u2019t show weakness.</p><p>I smiled briefly at Linny as she looked up from taking an order, and she winked at me. I walked right up to the counter and stared at the top of Johnny Mack\u2019s head as he bent over the grease pits. I was determined to stand there until the force of my will made him look up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jules,\u201d said a voice to my left.</p> <p>I jerked my head to see Shayna sitting alone at the lunch counter, smiling at me with tired eyes. Some of my ire fizzled down, but a large part of it just started a whole new swirl of uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014hey,\u201d I responded, not moving at first. I glanced back at Johnny Mack, who hadn\u2019t budged, and then back to her.</p><p>The polite thing to do would be to go talk to her, especially after the night we\u2019d had and the fact that she had been very nice then, too. Everything inside me battled as I wished her not to be so damn nice.</p><p>She looked girl-next-door pretty in a long denim skirt and matching jacket, and tall brown boots. It made me fidget with my own boring Ruthie-inspired black sweater and tank top over a black wraparound skirt and leggings. Maybe I felt the all-black would help me disappear. Maybe I wanted to feel as confident as Ruthie. But as I walked closer to Shayna, I felt like an old woman or a school librarian next to her freshness. I could have looked that good thirteen years ago, but I didn\u2019t then either. I was just as boring then.</p><p>\u201cDid you have the fried chicken?\u201d I asked, for lack of anything more rousing to say. \u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did have a piece,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the grilled veggies\u2014really good.\u201d</p><p>One piece. Great, she ate like a sparrow, too.</p><p>She looked sideways at Johnny Mack. \u201cI saw him banging with his cane,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s your store on the other side, right?\u201d</p><p>I blew out a breath. \u201cYes, and he\u2019s driving me up a damn tree with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does he do that?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe says he hears music,\u201d I said. \u201cWe hardly ever play any music. My mom used to, years ago, but I don\u2019t play anything. Linny doesn\u2019t even hear it,\u201d I said, raising my voice to reach him. \u201cHe\u2019s off his damn rocker.\u201d</p><p>I saw his mouth tighten, although he didn\u2019t look up, meaning he\u2019d seen me from the get-go and chose to ignore. The muscles in my shoulders tightened into tiny balls as the old hatred spurned by hurt burned deeper into my chest. I took a deep breath and turned away, facing Shayna full-on. I wouldn\u2019t let him goad me, not even with his haughty silence, not in front of her.</p><p>\u201cSo how is everything going?\u201d I asked, with not a clue in hell where I was going with it. She could take that fifty different directions, and I just hoped she\u2019d pick one.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, fiddling with her coffee cup, giving me nothing. Great. \u201cYour ex make it home okay last night?\u201d she asked, her nose crinkling on a cute smile.</p><p>I groaned. \u201cThat\u2019s a memory I\u2019d like to erase. For everyone.\u201d</p><p>Shayna laughed and pushed her cup away. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. We all have crazy exes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the sad part,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019s not. He\u2019s always been the stable one, emotionally. I\u2019ve never seen him be so idiotic before.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, looking at the counter before meeting my eyes again. \u201cI think maybe it was seeing Noah.\u201d</p><p>And there it was, the giant elephant.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cMore decaf, hon?\u201d Linny asked as she moved down the counter with a pot in each hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Shayna said, holding up a hand.</p><p>Linny questioned me with her eyes and I shook my head that I didn\u2019t need anything so she could keep going. I couldn\u2019t have any of these conversations around her, I never had in all these years. Not once did I ever talk to her about her brother, or giving up the baby, even though she always remained nice and chatty with me and even sent a beautiful card when Becca was born. It was like an unspoken agreement between us. We\u2019d talk about Johnny Mack being a dick, and we both knew why, but we didn\u2019t go there. And it was like Noah never existed.</p><p>With him back now, I knew she was keeping a bit of a distance to avoid conversation that might go past Hello and Here are the specials, and that was okay. I didn\u2019t know what to say, either.</p><p>\u201cWhen he first came to the table, I thought it was an old friend of Noah\u2019s,\u201d Shayna said, bringing me back. \u201cBut when Noah went into his\u2014glazed-over mode,\u201d she said with a gesture at her eyes, \u201cI realized it was the guy you\u2019d been dancing with earlier.\u201d</p><p>My stomach churned with the uncomfortable air that settled around us. \u201cWhat did Hayden say?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, he introduced himself, we did too, it was all fine until he made some comment about me keeping Noah on a tight leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I said into a hand I\u2019d raised to hide behind.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it pretty much went downhill from there.\u201d</p><p>I dropped my hand. \u201cShayna, I am so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled silently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jules. I\u2019m a big girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but\u2014\u201d I stopped and breathed in deep and let it out. \u201cI know you have probably been swamped with Noah\u2019s past since you crossed into Copper Falls, and it keeps landing on you at every turn.\u201d</p><p>She laughed out loud, transforming her face into stunning again. \u201cVery true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou handle it so damn well,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to grow up and be you one day.\u201d</p><p>She giggled again and touched my hand. \u201cNever fear, I\u2019m not as secure as I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then you fake it like a pro.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head, her face morphing into a mask of professionalism. \u201cMy daddy taught me to smile through pain, never to give your hand away, and shake hands like a man.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>Her face relaxed back into reality. \u201cYeah, my dad didn\u2019t have any boys.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out loud, realizing I felt truly relaxed for the first time in a week. Damn it, this girl could actually be my friend. If she weren\u2019t\u2014something else. The thought sent my gaze to her left hand, and my mind flew back in time to a piece of string that turned into a tiny gold band with a sparkly chip on top. Shayna sported a white-gold ring with a large square-cut diamond and smaller ones headed down the sides. It was gorgeous. And expensive. I wondered if he\u2019d tied a piece of string around her finger first.</p><p>\u201cSo speaking of boys,\u201d I began, feeling braver in our conversation. \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re having?\u201d</p><p>The light in her eyes faded instantly, although the smile remained tacked in place. One hand rested against her belly protectively. I remembered that feeling.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said. \u201cNot sure if I\u2019m going to. I\u2019m kind of old school like that. I want the surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did too,\u201d I said, thinking only of Becca. I didn\u2019t even let myself go anywhere else. \u201cI know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014how was it when you were pregnant?\u201d she asked, meeting my eyes with an odd look. For a hair of a second I wondered if she was talking about the other one. Noah\u2019s. I opened my mouth, but it went dry as my heartbeat sped up. \u201cI mean, was the dad all involved in it or was it mainly just you?\u201d</p><p>The strange question took me off guard even more than my fear of which pregnancy she was talking about. I licked my lips so they\u2019d function again.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014yeah, he was very involved, wanted to know everything, feel every kick.\u201d Both times. I remembered Noah kissing my belly good-bye every day. Hayden spooning me, sleeping with his hand palming my stomach, holding both of us. \u201cI was lucky,\u201d I said, never realizing that before.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get a read on her mood, but it had definitely shifted. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you have that, too,\u201d I said, pushing to lighten the air. \u201cJust keep him up on all of it, because they don\u2019t have the advantage we do, of our own little personal dance party going on twenty-four-seven. They just get to look in the window.\u201d</p><p>Shayna smiled again, chuckling at that as she looked down thoughtfully. \u201cGood point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may want to ask mommy advice from someone who values the role,\u201d said a scratchy voice to my right.</p><p>We both turned to see Johnny Mack standing behind the counter in front of us, having come around from the kitchen without either of us noticing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I breathed.</p><p>Without looking at me, he wiped his hands on his apron and patted Shayna\u2019s hand. \u201cYou care about family, honey. This one doesn\u2019t. She throws one kid away and never thinks of him again while she raises another to be a heathen.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with instant tears and every molecule of my body lit up with a blaze of heat. His image swam before me and all I could hear was my own breathing. I couldn\u2019t even look at Shayna. I felt her grip on my hand, and I blinked the tears down my face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say things like that,\u201d I heard her say quietly.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d he began, again pretending I wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d I whispered, my voice too shaky to go louder. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk to me for years, and then you go spewing poison like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still not talking to you,\u201d he said, focusing on Shayna. \u201cI\u2019ve fixed your screwups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you,\u201d he repeated slowly, looking me in the eye for the first time. \u201cI\u2019m telling Shayna what I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything,\u201d I said, not recognizing the raw gravelly tone coming from my throat. I pushed away from the counter. \u201cAnd how dare you insult Becca like that, you miserable old fuck. You aren\u2019t even lucky enough to know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said, leaning over the counter, his wrinkled face older than I remembered noticing. \u201cI have real grandchildren to get to know. My blood.\u201d</p><p>I backed up, noticing Shayna\u2019s shocked face drain even paler as she stared at Johnny Mack. I was oblivious to the tears running down my face.</p><p>\u201cRot in hell, old man,\u201d I said, the words choking me even as my hatred for him overwhelmed me. Once upon a time I\u2019d loved him like a father. He\u2019d treated me like his own. It broke my heart and hardened it at the same time. \u201cAnd you bang on that wall one more time,\u201d I said through my teeth, pushing forward again \u201cand so help me, I will personally come over here and rip everything off of yours. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a towel and began wiping down the counter as if I\u2019d never been there. Sobs bubbled up and I turned and bolted through the door, pushing a lady out of my way and barreling straight into Noah\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWhoa,\u201d he exclaimed, wrapping his arms around me to stabilize us both before looking to see who he\u2019d caught. \u201cJules, what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>I broke free without speaking and pushed past him.</p><p>\u201cJules, wait, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he said, following me.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone, Noah.\u201d</p><p>If I\u2019d only had my purse with me I would have headed straight for my car and driven home. In lieu of that, I yanked open the door to the bookstore and prayed he\u2019d stop.</p><p>He didn\u2019t, and the barrage of questions trailed behind me all the way to the break room, the swinging door bouncing in his wake. I whirled on him, adrenaline sending a new wave of hot tears over the edge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed back here,\u201d I said, my voice shaking with anger.</p><p>\u201cDeal with it,\u201d he said, looking at me with exasperation. \u201cWhat happened over there that\u2019s got you so upset? Surely, Shayna didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>I laughed, a bitter sound I didn\u2019t even recognize. \u201cAre you kidding me? Shayna is like the nicest person on the planet. I didn\u2019t think it was even possible to be that good.\u201d</p><p>A tiny look of relief passed over his face. \u201cWhat, then?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>I scoffed, remembering the horrid words and trying to shove the burning sob down that wanted to split me in half.</p><p>She throws one kid away and never thinks of him again . . .</p><p>It won. A noise of pain escaped my throat, and I hissed in a breath to quell it.</p><p>\u201cAsk your father,\u201d I spit out, turning away.</p><p>I headed for the fridge, wanting to stick my head in the freezer, but the grip on my upper arm stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI asked you,\u201d he said roughly as he spun me around.</p><p>We both inhaled sharply as we landed together and found ourselves nearly nose to nose. I blinked tears free, bringing Noah\u2019s face into perfect focus. His quickened breath felt warm on my face, and all the hard lines of his expression dissolved when he searched my eyes.</p><p>\u201cShit, Jules,\u201d he said under his breath, so softly it was nearly inaudible.</p><p>One of his hands went to my face as if on autopilot, and I shut my eyes tight as the warmth of his hand against my cheek and hair nearly broke me. I could smell him, feel him, and I didn\u2019t dare open my eyes to look at him. He\u2019d see it.</p><p>\u201cNoah, don\u2019t,\u201d I whispered through broken breaths. I reached up to pull his hand away, but then the other side of my head was cradled as well, and all my strength melted away. My grip on his hand stayed where it was, and I could feel the slight tremble. Or was that me?</p><p>I didn\u2019t open my eyes until I felt his thumbs move across my cheeks, wiping away tears, and it hit me in the chest like a wrecking ball. He looked like someone had beaten the crap out of him from the inside. His eyelids were heavy, like a man who hadn\u2019t slept in days. The turmoil radiating off of him was palpable.</p><p> That, plus the feel of his hands in my hair, the closeness of his body, so close I could feel him breathe, it was almost too much. His eyes went to my mouth, and for a second it was like ropes were pulling us together. I could nearly taste him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Noah asked finally, halting the forward motion, his voice hoarse and strained.</p><p>I shook my head as much as I could inside his hold. I wasn\u2019t going to pit him against his father, and I didn\u2019t want another fight. \u201cIt\u2019s my battle with him,\u201d I said. \u201cIt has been for years. He just\u2014\u201d I stopped to pull it together as the burn jabbed at me again. \u201cCrossed the line today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be.\u201d</p><p>Everything in me wanted to wind my arms around him and pull him the rest of the way in, to feel his lips come down on mine, but I shoved that thought away. That was from a lifetime ago. The old us. Before a baby and parents and an ocean and two decades separated all that we were. I grasped his hands instead to pull away gently and backed up a half step, still holding on.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t help who our parents are,\u201d I said.</p><p>A look that felt like an eternity passed between us, full of so many things I couldn\u2019t read and yet couldn\u2019t look away from. Then he slowly pulled his hands from mine, running them over his face and up through his hair as he walked around the tiny break room.</p><p>The moment was broken, but something had shifted. The walls that weren\u2019t really walls but more of a respectful barrier had gone wiggly. From last night\u2019s moment on the back patio to just seconds earlier, the push-pull thing between us had taken on a life of its own.</p><p>My feet had taken root in the cheap carpet when he touched me, but I refused to stand there like a stunned statue. I refused to let Noah see what he could still do to me. Forcing myself into motion, I made it to the fridge, swiping the tears from my too-warm face on the way. With shaking hands I grabbed two waters and held one out to him, thinking he might need the cold as much as I did.</p><p>He stopped by the sink and took it from me, leaning back against the counter and draining half of it in two swallows. He took a deep breath and crossed his arms, letting his gaze fall on me again like there were a thousand questions to ask. There weren\u2019t. He looked like he felt safer over there, but the room wasn\u2019t big enough for me to share that opinion. The mere six feet separating us seemed like two, and it was as if all the air had been sucked from the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still here, in this store?\u201d he asked finally, holding up his hands quickly. \u201cAnd don\u2019t take that wrong or get mad at me. It\u2019s just a question.\u201d</p><p>Just a question. I was learning that nothing was that simple with him now. I wanted to ask him why he was still here in this store. Like, instead of next door with his woman.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you come back to Copper Falls?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes and paused for a second. \u201cFamily.\u201d</p><p> \u201cDitto,\u201d I said, tilting my head like Ruthie would. Like she would likely come in and do any minute after watching Noah follow me back there. \u201cI\u2019m here because my mother wanted me to take this on.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cBecause it\u2019s me and not you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because I came back on my own,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cNo one wrote up a map and a guidebook and demanded I follow it.\u201d</p><p>I felt my jaw muscles tighten, my shoulders following close behind. That was good. Angry and closed off was better than emotional and wanting to dive under his clothes.</p><p>\u201cOnce upon a time, you were my best friend, Noah,\u201d I said, keeping my voice low and nearly quiver-free. He blinked and pulled in a long breath, telling me I\u2019d hit a nerve. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been gone a long time. I don\u2019t pretend to still know you like I used to. So don\u2019t judge my life like you\u2019ve been here to see it.\u201d</p><p>There was another of those pensive looks of his, and I had to look away to keep from getting pinned to the floor again. I drained the last of my water and tossed the bottle in the trash, finger-combing my hair back. I needed to stay in that mode. No more damn tears, especially not in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging you, Jules,\u201d he said. \u201cOr I\u2019m not meaning to come across that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re failing, then.\u201d</p><p> He pushed off the counter and came to stand in front of me again, crossing his arms for a sense of distance. Or possibly to keep from touching me. \u201cNo disrespect to your mom, but she and I never saw eye to eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d he said, his voice harder, rising to my bait. \u201cShe worked you like a puppet back then, and\u2014\u201d He breathed in and out as if weighing his words. \u201cI guess I always hoped you\u2019d get out from under her one day.\u201d</p><p>I felt my chin tremble, but it wasn\u2019t from sadness, it was from my blood boiling.</p><p>\u201cShe died,\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not under anyone.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head just slightly, his eyes boring into mine. \u201cTwenty-six years and you\u2019re still here doing her bidding. Running a store you wanted no part of, giving up on what made you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you,\u201d I seethed, pushing forward, not caring how close that put me. \u201cYou come back here after all this time and dare to tell me where I\u2019ve gone wrong. You told me last night that I didn\u2019t know the life you\u2019d lived, well right back at you, babe.\u201d My voice quivered with anger this time, and I didn\u2019t care. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve done since you left has been on me. Every choice, every path I\u2019ve chosen has been alone. Even when I was married, I was alone in my own head. You think you had to go overseas to be alone with your pain?\u201d I poked him in the chest. \u201cI was in a whole damn town full of people and was completely by myself.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand when I poked him, eyes flaring. I got the feeling that people didn\u2019t dare do that to him. Well, then he shouldn\u2019t have come back, because I didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass at that moment about his aggression or pride or who he was in that other world.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to art school?\u201d he pushed.</p><p>\u201cJesus, why do you care?\u201d I breathed. \u201cAnd why do you remember that?\u201d</p><p>He used my hand to pull me in to him, jaw muscles twitching. He looked intimidating, but I was too torqued to let him mess with my head like that. I held my chin up higher and glared right back at him, pushing back the turmoil I felt in my own core at being held tightly against him. That didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cI remember everything,\u201d he whispered through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you were so damned concerned about where I\u2019d land,\u201d I said, pulling my hand free and pushing at him. It only pushed me back, instead. \u201cThen what kept you on the other side of the world?\u201d</p><p>The thin white scar above his lip twitched. My heart sped up as I realized what the new thing was about him that made me so crazy. The softer he looked and spoke, the higher his engine cranked, so that talking up close and personal felt like a lightning show.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I couldn\u2019t stand to see everything ripped apart,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was easier to start over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier,\u201d I repeated, smiling. \u201cHow convenient for you.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes went dark. \u201cDon\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you already did,\u201d I said, moving back to lean against the counter where he\u2019d previously been. I gripped the edges so he wouldn\u2019t see my trembling. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the market on self-righteous anger, Noah. I\u2019ve got a little of that myself. You followed me in here, and you\u2019re welcome to leave if it\u2019s uncomfortable now. If it\u2019s easier.\u201d</p><p>I knew I was playing with fire, even as the words fell out of my mouth. I expected to see the rage I\u2019d seen the night before. Maybe he\u2019d come pin me to the counter and yell at me. Maybe he\u2019d storm out and leave and not come back. He didn\u2019t do either of those things.</p><p>Instead, his face went stony, and he took two slow steps in my direction before stopping and shoving his hands in the pockets of his jeans. It was an odd tack, and while initially bewildering, I saw the barely restrained energy pulsing through him. What was intended to be a casual stance of nonchalance was given away by the tightness in his shoulders and arms and a tiny twitch by his right eye. He focused on my mouth instead of my eyes and looked like he was ready to either chew me up or kiss me, and that thought was the one thing that did make my knees go weak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d he said slowly, robotically. He\u2019d flipped a switch somewhere.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d I whispered. I truly had nothing left. Between Noah and his dad I felt like I\u2019d just run ten miles in the sand with boots on.</p><p>His head moved almost imperceptibly, and just as he was about to speak the door opened slightly. Ruthie stood halfway in, one eyebrow raised in question as she looked from me to Noah and back again.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He never turned around, never took his gaze off my face, and as I met his eyes I realized it might never be okay.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said.</p><p>She nodded slowly and backed out, not looking entirely convinced. I wasn\u2019t either. But I was too tired to do the leaving. He needed to go.</p><p>\u201cNoah, it\u2019s been a shitty morning and looks to be an equally dismal afternoon,\u201d I said, rubbing at my face. \u201cCan you just go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about after I left,\u201d he said in a low, toneless voice.</p><p>I wanted to scream.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I pushed off the counter and made to walk past him, choosing to leave if he wouldn\u2019t, but he reached across my middle to stop me, holding me at my waist.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d His face was still a mask, but his eyes looked different. Haunted, maybe.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything, Noah,\u201d I said, taking his hand off my waist but suddenly unable to let it go. It felt right, holding his hand, his arm, like in that one second we were who we used to know. It was disconcerting, and I averted my eyes. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how you feel about me. You feel like I bailed, I feel like you did, and your dad thinks I\u2019m the Antichrist. None of it matters now.\u201d I squeezed his hand. \u201cI may have signed those papers, but it\u2019s not like I wanted to. And you left me to deal with the fallout of it all by myself, with a daily dose of your father to make damn sure I paid the price.\u201d</p><p>I let go of him and went back to the fridge for another water bottle, not offering him one this time. Not even looking at him. I couldn\u2019t get through even the summarized version if I did. I put the icy cold bottle on the back of my neck, closing my eyes as the cold chilled down my blood.</p><p>\u201cMy parents pretended it never happened,\u201d I said, keeping my eyes shut. \u201cNo one talked about it, no one grieved with me but Ruthie. The days went by in my house as if he never exis\u2014\u201d I swallowed back tears, determined not to cry again. \u201cEven when Becca came along years later, everyone acted as if it were the first time, even my mother. She gave me pregnancy tips like I\u2019d never been there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Hayden know?\u201d</p><p>The thickness of his voice, heavy with emotion, pulled me out of my reverie and I opened my eyes. His face was tight and his eyes reddened as if he were fighting tears himself.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I looked away and twisted the cap off my water. \u201cHe pulled me out of a self-destructive place and I loved him for that. I always told him the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich explains last night.\u201d</p><p>I let out an exhausted breath. \u201cNot really. He\u2019s never acted like that. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cHe just\u2014\u201d I swallowed hard against the guilt that always danced there. \u201cI learned early on not to count on anyone but myself, and I guess he had too many years of being on the losing end of that.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and held my head up as I watched his expression change. He turned and walked slowly to the door, stopping before he reached it and putting his hands on his hips like he knew he needed to keep walking but couldn\u2019t. My chest burned with that same need to stop him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done with this, Noah,\u201d I said to his back quietly, thankful he wasn\u2019t looking at me. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to talk about it anymore. I\u2019ve got my own problems, and you have a second chance at fatherhood sitting right next door.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, not turning around, and pushed through the door as I took a deep breath and sagged against the counter. There weren\u2019t any more tears. I was just exhausted. Mentally, emotionally, and physically spent.</p><p>I covered my face with my hands, still seeing his face\u2014his eyes\u2014in my mind. So close I could have kissed him three different times. Shit, shit, shit. Everything we used to be in another lifetime was still there, pushing and tugging and teasing. It wasn\u2019t just my imagination. I\u2019d seen it in his eyes as well.</p><p>I had to stay away from him. That was all there was to it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I needed normal. Like, in a big way.</p><p>I needed to just come to work, do my job, go home, argue with Becca, go to bed, and do it all over again the next day. Well, Becca\u2019s piece of that pie was still covered, but not in a comfortable way. And what wasn\u2019t in the pie, but basically the whipped cream on the side\u2014no pun intended\u2014was Patrick. Or someone like Patrick. Someone to feed that adult side of me that didn\u2019t require major maintenance or deep feelings.</p><p>Unfortunately, I\u2019d probably burned that bridge, and I felt bad about that. Not for me, but for him. He was a good guy and treated me like a queen. He even had started to pick up on things\u2014little things that were important to me. Like a boyfriend might do. Which put him back in that maintenance category that probably needed trimming back. Just maybe not in the manner I\u2019d trimmed it.</p><p>And now, with the current change in tide, I wouldn\u2019t have been satisfied with the side of whipped cream anymore, anyway. I wanted more pie. The original pie.</p> <p>I was screwed.</p><p>Ruthie kept eyeing me for the next hour as I pulled extra copies of older titles from the shelves and loaded them into a box for donation to the library. My mother used to make a big event of that, advertising for people to come drop off their used books, making little stickers to attach to the insides of the books that said Donated with love and sparkles from Book Enchantment.</p><p>I just couldn\u2019t get into all that. Ruthie would if I gave her half a chance, but I didn\u2019t have the patience. I needed to stay busy and not hover and obsess over Becca\u2019s life, and not think about mine at all. Anything was better than what wanted to invade my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHey, did you turn in an idea for the store decoration?\u201d I asked, completely not caring whatsoever. And she knew that.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d she said with a wink.</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m on it,\u201d she said, haughty little head tilt in play. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me,\u201d I said, already not worrying about it.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked when I tossed the box on a chair. She stopped me and made me look at her. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed and nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d Then I shook my head. \u201cNo. But it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worry about you,\u201d she said, her dark eyes soft.</p> <p>A small smile relaxed my face muscles. \u201cI know. I\u2019m good, I promise. I\u2019m gonna go\u2014\u201d I pointed at the box and lost my train of thought as I gestured toward the door.</p><p>\u201cTo the library?\u201d she asked, squeezing my arm.</p><p>\u201cThat would be it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re good, all right,\u201d she said with an eyebrow cocked. Conceding, she let out a sigh. \u201cHeaded over there right now?\u201d</p><p>I grabbed my purse and balanced the box on one hip. \u201cGood a time as any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s an awesome old rocking chair over at The Brass Ass I want you to look at when you get a chance.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cA rocking chair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Story Time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s beat up, but Frank can restore it and make it look really cool.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cI thought you hated that place.\u201d</p><p>The Brass Ass was an antique-slash-resale shop on the other side of town. They were annoying. They had a brass donkey on the lawn.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cI like the barn better, but the rocker can\u2019t help where it ended up.\u201d</p><p>The barn was an actual old barn turned into a junk business the next block up and run by the Barneses. Old Tin Barnes. Too cute for me, but Ruthie had an antique fetish. And Copper Falls was proud of its discards.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, palming my keys. \u201cBrass Ass. Rocking chair. Is there more than one? Do I need a guide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, just the one,\u201d she said. Her eyes searched mine, though, always seeing too much. \u201cI can go rip some ass, I\u2019m telling you,\u201d she said.</p><p>I smiled. I wasn\u2019t feeling it, and I knew she knew that, but I smiled anyway. \u201cNo ass ripping necessary. It\u2019s all fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppearances are deceiving,\u201d I said, walking toward the door. \u201cIf you really want to rip somebody, though, go cut Johnny Mack\u2019s tires or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I gave her a look over my shoulder. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you said to him, by the way,\u201d she said as my hand landed on the door handle, \u201che looked ready to lose it.\u201d</p><p>I stopped, knowing the \u201chim\u201d wasn\u2019t Johnny Mack, and stared out the window to the trees behind the gazebo.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It took me a few minutes to get on the highway and drive the few exits down to the Katyville Public Library, the same highway that took me everywhere. Including two trips to the hospital to give birth. The radio crooned a love ballad, and I stabbed at the button with my finger. The next station\u2019s DJ made a comment about an hour of eighties music, and I snapped the power off, rubbing a temple to ease the dull headache coming on.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t worth my sanity.</p><p>When I pulled into the library\u2019s parking lot, I avoided the side area that was closer to the building but so cramped that it was difficult to get your car out unscathed. Choosing the longer walk with a heavy box, I pulled in and parked.</p><p>Just as I was tugging the box from the backseat and fighting a snag against the door, all my senses took note of a dark blue truck with shiny chrome trim pulling in next to me.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think I could take another Noah encounter just yet. It was going to go badly. Furious at the turn of my day, and trying to stomp back all the sensations that kept attacking me every time he made an appearance, I yanked one last time to free the box of books.</p><p>And it came out. Knocking me off balance as the box toppled and all the books scattered on the pavement around me.</p><p>I will not cry. I heard the door open and shut, and I pulled anger from every cell in my body to help overcome feeling like a weak klutz. I braced myself for his voice, but what I got was significantly lighter.</p><p>\u201cJules?\u201d It was Shayna. \u201cOh, my Lord, let me help you.\u201d</p><p>I looked up in surprise as she hurried to kneel beside me and pluck the books up as the wind rifled their pages. Shayna driving Noah\u2019s truck around\u2014like a couple. They are a couple, I chided myself.</p><p>I was struck with relief, gratefulness, and then guilt as I remembered her fianc\u00e9\u2019s hands in my hair earlier, wiping my tears and coming so damn close to kissing me. I doubted she\u2019d be on her hands and knees in a skirt helping me if she knew about that.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, tossing an armful into the box, no longer caring if they were straight. \u201cGod, it\u2019s been a day.\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath and shook her head, little pieces of hair blowing into her face. \u201cI know, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Oh. No. She had no idea. Johnny Mack\u2019s insults were a distant buzz in the back of my head, spurring my headache on. That had been bad, but what had my heart pumping pain into it was Noah.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe\u2014\u201d she continued. \u201cI mean, I know you said something about him the other night, but that was just\u2014uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, choosing not to let my emotions be pulled back in again. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that he doesn\u2019t have a filter, Shayna, he just says whatever is there.\u201d I forced out a chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d be immune to it by now.\u201d</p><p>I felt the pause.</p><p>\u201cYou and he were close once, weren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, grabbing one more wayward paperback hiding behind my tire.</p><p>My first reaction was to lie and make some off-the-cuff remark about how no one could ever be close to Johnny Mack Ryan. But something about Shayna made me feel that I could be honest. In some things. Things that didn\u2019t involve me wanting to undress Noah and lick him.</p><p>\u201cA million years ago,\u201d I said on a laugh, scooping my hair out of my face. \u201cBefore\u2014\u201d I said, glancing her direction. \u201cWell\u2014before. He used to make cookies for all Noah\u2019s friends when we were young, and they had the good backyard with all the trees, so it was kind of the place to be.\u201d</p><p>We rose at the same time, and I saw the questions in her face before she asked them.</p><p>\u201cAnd when you were together?\u201d</p><p>I nodded and smiled over the pinprick to my midsection. \u201cIt was good until it wasn\u2019t. Why?\u201d</p><p>She blinked a couple of times, appearing to ponder that. \u201cBecause if he\u2019d always been mean, he wouldn\u2019t have the power to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled and looked at the pavement. \u201cVery true.\u201d I shifted the box of books onto my hip and started walking, wishing for a subject change as she fell into step beside me. \u201cSo what brings you over here?\u201d</p><p>She laughed lightly and grinned a little sheepishly. \u201cI wanted a book.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cI know a closer commute.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh grew melodic. \u201cI know, I\u2019m so crazy. But I didn\u2019t know if it would be awkward\u2014me coming over there.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cI take everyone\u2019s money equally,\u201d I said, making her snicker again.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d she said. \u201cNow if Noah would just relax.\u201d</p><p>My stomach clenched and I gripped the box tighter. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, he\u2019s so paranoid we\u2019re going to end up in the same room or something,\u201d she said. \u201cLike we\u2019re gonna compare notes.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, but it was an uncomfortable laugh, and I felt he might be right. Just talking about him with her was giving me the willies.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s been so moody the last two days. Today when he got to the diner he was somewhere else completely, not listening to anyone, so I dropped him at home and told him to have a beer and tell me how to find the library,\u201d she said. She held up her palms as if to justify. \u201cHe\u2019d do that a lot when he was working, so it\u2019s not new to me. Everything was classified and everything ate him up until it was done. But, my God, we\u2019re just sitting here in this sleepy little town, what could be so damn stressful?\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened and closed, and I turned to focus on the doors ahead, spotting Becca\u2019s little blue Chevy parked on the side. Where all the cars were jammed together. A new irk joined all the rest in my brain as I thought about her not telling me she was going anywhere, parking where I\u2019d specifically told her was a guaranteed fender bender, and Noah\u2019s apparent mood change after our encounter. I felt a sweat breaking out.</p><p>\u201cWell, coming home is probably an adjustment,\u201d I said, turning to face her before we went in. \u201cHe\u2019s about to be a dad\u2014and a husband.\u201d And I said that with not a bit of stutter.</p><p>The light left her face. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I was taken off guard by that and wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. It wasn\u2019t like we were best friends or anything tight enough to dig around. She wasn\u2019t Ruthie. I couldn\u2019t threaten to take her mixer away if she didn\u2019t spill the goods.</p><p>I bit my lower lip. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she repeated, distracted. She twisted her fingers together and averted her eyes. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, not actually feeling okay about it. Her face said it wasn\u2019t going to be okay. It wasn\u2019t going to be something innocent like who cut my hair or where I got my necklace.</p><p>Her eyes met mine, blinking fast. \u201cDo you think things really happen for a reason? Like\u2014you know\u2014every purpose under Heaven and all that?\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t what I expected. \u201cUm, yeah, I guess so.\u201d My mind reeled, looking for the reasons behind that question. \u201cI\u2019ve always kind of had to believe that, it got me through some rough times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean,\u201d she said, her pretty face going serious. \u201cI worry about stuff like that. My mom\u2019s always been one for \u2018Give it to God, things happen like they\u2019re supposed to,\u2019 and all that, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped, and I was intrigued.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not making the right choice?\u201d she asked, her voice fading at the end and the color in her cheeks fading with it.</p><p>I blinked and pushed down the feeling of impending shock that wanted to land on me before I even knew what she really meant.</p><p>\u201cAbout what, Shayna?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She licked her lips and her eyes misted. \u201cAbout marrying Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It felt as if all the air in my lungs was sucked out with a vacuum cleaner.</p><p>Oh, my God.</p><p>I stared at her, trying not to look shocked or disturbed or confused as hell. I must have pulled one heck of a bluff if she was able to admit any reservations about her relationship with Noah to me. It went against all brands of woman code to show weakness with your man\u2019s ex. Then again, I realized, she was new to town and alone except for Noah, and I was probably the closest thing she had to a friend in Copper Falls. That just proved how truly twisted up the situation was.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just nerves,\u201d I said on a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered with a forced smile as she dabbed at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got double-duty hormones going crazy, too, so don\u2019t let your mind mess with you like that,\u201d I said, wondering where the words were coming from. \u201cAnd my ex-husband\u2019s floor show probably didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were about to break up again when I got pregnant,\u201d she blurted, two heavy tears breaking free from her eyes. She instantly sucked in a deep breath and blew it out slowly like the words had been strangling her. All the color came rushing back to her cheeks.</p><p>And probably to mine, as well.</p><p>\u201cAg\u2014\u201d I stopped and cleared my throat. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she breathed, covering her face with her hands. \u201cWhat is this, true confessions day?\u201d</p><p>My box suddenly felt like it grew in poundage, and I shifted it on my hip. \u201cLet\u2019s\u2014go inside, Shayna,\u201d I said, pulling the door open. \u201cWe can go sit down.\u201d</p><p>I needed the seconds to pull my head together as well. Okay, pregnancy before marriage happened all the time; that was no shocker. It had been the same with me, and Noah was trying to make sure he did it right this time. That explained his revisit of so much of our history, too. It probably felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>But being about to break up\u2014again\u2014that was a whole new head spin.</p><p>\u201cNo, I should just go,\u201d she said, looking back toward the parking lot, her eyes looking troubled again. Probably that woman code slapping her in the face.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I said, guiding her in. I pointed at a group of couches and chairs in a far corner. \u201cLet me go turn these in and I\u2019ll meet you over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, what are you doing here?\u201d said a voice behind me.</p><p>I wheeled around and handed Becca the heavy box. \u201cHey, Bec, help me out a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your daughter?\u201d Shayna asked, swiping quickly at her eyes.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYes, this is Becca.\u201d I put my arm around her neck and squeezed her in a hug that I hoped she was smiling for and not looking tortured. \u201cBec, this is Shayna Baird. She\u2019s\u2014\u201d How to explain? Becca didn\u2019t even know Noah. \u201cShe\u2019s Johnny Mack\u2019s son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>Shayna chuckled and shook Becca\u2019s free hand, and I was proud of myself for not choking on the word.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Becca said, very polite. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Johnny Mack had a son. Thought it was just Linny.\u201d</p><p>I saw Shayna\u2019s eyes dart to me for a split second and then she did her practiced smile. \u201cHe\u2019s like the prodigal son returning.\u201d</p><p>Becca laughed and then gestured at the box on her hip. \u201cReason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring that up to the counter for me, please,\u201d I said. \u201cThose are donations from the store. Why are you here, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLizzy had a book on hold for a project and I said I\u2019d meet her here before we go to the mall,\u201d she said, just as the blonde and perpetually cute Lizzy walked up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to the mall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI texted you all this.\u201d At my questioning look, she rolled her eyes. \u201cOkay, I was going to text you all this. I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going?\u201d I asked, still fixated on the image of her hooking up with the mystery Mark.</p><p>\u201cMe and Lizzy,\u201d she said slowly, with the tinge of last night\u2019s argument still blanketing her as well. \u201cThere\u2019s a shoe sale at Epic, can I have some money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said. \u201cYou just got three new pairs of shoes and a pair of boots at Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll buy some boots for you and we can share,\u201d she said, cheesy smile in place as she looked hopeful.</p><p>\u201cRight, like I\u2019m gonna want to wear your boots,\u201d I said. I pulled three twenties from an inner pocket of my purse. \u201cConsider it toward your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ms. White,\u201d Lizzy said with a sweet smile.</p><p>\u201cHi, Lizzy, good to see you,\u201d I said. \u201cShop smart, Becca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty dollars? That\u2019s all?\u201d she said, eyeing the bills with dismay.</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cIf you need more than that for shoes, it\u2019s not a sale, Bec. Make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue,\u201d Lizzy whispered.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said, hugging me briefly. \u201cOh, by the way, they invited me over for a big barbecue thing later, that okay?\u201d</p><p>Of course they did.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d I said as she turned to make a beeline for the counter with my box. \u201cAnd be careful leaving the parking lot since you parked\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the pit of hell, I know,\u201d she said, waving as she kept walking. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, watching them walk away, Becca\u2019s dark shiny lopsided hair swinging over a baggy hoodie jacket and jeans she could have painted on.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait,\u201d Shayna said with a smirk.</p><p>I chuckled and shook my head. \u201cYeah. Luckily they start out sweet and unable to talk so you can fall in love with them before you get that.\u201d I pointed in her direction. Shayna laughed out loud, some happiness coming back into her face. \u201cLet me go get the receipt for this and I\u2019ll meet you over there.\u201d</p><p>When I rejoined her in the corner, she had her game face back on, and I wondered if she\u2019d had a chance to dial it back and change her mind. I would if it were me.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful, Jules. Stunning, actually.\u201d</p><p>That warmed my heart. \u201cThank you,\u201d I said, sinking onto a couch sideways to face her. I had the oddest sense of a repeat performance since I\u2019d just talked to Becca the same way the night before. Hopefully the outcome would be better. \u201cShe has the potential\u2014if she keeps her mouth closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine it isn\u2019t easy being a single mom,\u201d she said, leaning an elbow on the back of the couch.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, but Hayden helps. When she lets him,\u201d I added. \u201cShe\u2019s making us both crazy right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember feeling so under my dad\u2019s thumb,\u201d Shayna said. \u201cI\u2019d do anything just to give him a shock. One time I came home with a nose ring and a dog collar necklace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cI know, it was hideous, but I was just trying to spread myself out a little. Once he let up, I wasn\u2019t interested in the weird stuff anymore.\u201d She hesitated a beat and tilted her head. \u201cYour daughter doesn\u2019t know, does she? About Noah and\u2014everything?\u201d</p><p>Everything. I shook my head. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a reason for her to know. It was all before her time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the longer time goes on, it\u2019s harder to do,\u201d she said, her voice going softer at the end. Guilt settled in my belly, but there was something else there in her tone. Something that maybe wasn\u2019t about me.</p><p>Shayna picked at a perfect fingernail that didn\u2019t need picking, but I knew it was so she wouldn\u2019t have to look me in the eye as the real conversation came up to queue.</p><p>\u201cIt was really good in the beginning with me and Noah,\u201d she said, and I dug my not-so-perfect fingernails into my palm. \u201cOf course, it always is. And it was for a long time. I think it was after I moved in with him that things started going south.\u201d</p><p>I remembered the same thing with Hayden. \u201cMoving in changes a lot of couples,\u201d I offered, feeling a little like a therapist on a clock. \u201cNothing to hide behind anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014he\u2019d get in these moods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoods?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t active in the field anymore, but he was still in top secret clearance and the man leaves nothing at the office,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery funk that went down there with any of the teams would be all over him for days, and when that was over there would be nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReliving,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She scooped her hair back and let it fall. \u201cBut all that was okay.\u201d She looked up and met my gaze. \u201cI was in love. I would put up with anything.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard and nodded. \u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>She looked back at her fingers. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t commit. Couldn\u2019t say the words. I wasn\u2019t in it for a casual roommate, I wanted the whole show. Love, marriage, family. So we broke up and I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but I was miserable,\u201d she said on a chuckle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it without him. I started going out with anyone who would ask me just to stay busy. I had no filter, it was\u2014bad. One guy wouldn\u2019t give up when I called it off, and started stalking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I was so stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I would have been thinking right, I wouldn\u2019t have started up with him in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNoah heard about it from a cop friend of ours that I\u2019d reported it to, and he tracked the guy down.\u201d At my apparent questioning look, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s different in Italy, Jules. A lot of things go beyond the police.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cAre you saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I have no idea,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cNoah has connections everywhere, Jules, and in that world a phone call solves a problem in a second.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened and I knew not to ask, but the guy never showed up at my door again.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my arms as the goose bumps traveled up and down. It was a side of Noah I never knew about. The dark side he learned on the other side of the world and kept hidden behind those very guarded eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe ended up deciding to give it another shot after that,\u201d she said, looking off at nothing in particular, something worrying her expression. \u201cHe retired, so I moved back in, thinking things might be different. We tried, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, still looking off, and I felt her pain.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you found out you were pregnant,\u201d I said, keeping my voice soft.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe was so happy,\u201d she said on a whisper, tears filling her eyes. \u201cI know he loves me, but it never felt like it was enough. He was always so haunted by not knowing his son, I think it\u2019s honestly the only thing that could ever fill that hole in his heart.\u201d</p><p>My chest felt like it would cave in with her words, and I swallowed hard against the burn that wanted out.</p><p>She blinked her tears free and swiped at her cheeks, then rested a hand against her stomach. \u201cI felt like this baby could be our saving grace,\u201d she said. \u201cLike everything happens for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, she believed that. That holding him with a child would work. I shut my eyes against the sick irony of it all. He left one woman for giving a family away and was trapped with another woman to keep one.</p><p>\u201cI just want to give him that,\u201d she said, wiping her cheeks free and trying to blink back the rest. \u201cThat zoned-out look he gets when he looks at all those pictures. I want him to have what he missed.\u201d</p><p>I was still breathing through all that she\u2019d told me when something didn\u2019t sound right. I went back a few beats and dug till\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat pictures?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf his son,\u201d she said, as if that were clear.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes and smiled, sure that I had misunderstood. \u201cWhat pictures are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>She frowned, like I wasn\u2019t talking sense. \u201cHe had all those pictures his dad sent through the years framed and taking over a side table like a shrine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPict\u2014there are pictures?\u201d I said, feeling the words leave my mouth but not really hearing them.</p><p>Her frown deepened from confusion to concern. \u201cJules, why don\u2019t you know this?\u201d</p><p>There was an odd ringing in my ears, and my fingers felt numb, most likely from the lack of breathing on my part.</p><p>Noah had photos of our son. Noah had photos of our son. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said, getting to my feet. \u201cI have to go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I had no memory of leaving Katyville or coming down the highway. It was like I woke up in front of the diner, having gotten there on autopilot. My eyes were hot and dry, like I had used all the liquid up and I was just going to fry from within.</p><p>My heart was thundering in my chest and in my ears. He had all those pictures his dad sent through the years framed and taking over a side table like a shrine.</p><p>How was it possible? How did his dad get them? How could he?</p><p>I could go ask the source, I thought, glaring through the diner window all decorated in shoe polish snowflakes. Linny\u2019s contribution. And I would, but Noah was first. He never said a word about photos, and I was driven to find out why and see them for myself. It was a physical ache pulling me to Johnny Mack\u2019s house.</p> <p>Shayna was probably right on my tail, or burning up Noah\u2019s phone, but I didn\u2019t care. She could watch me rip Noah a new one and then follow me to the diner to get to the truth.</p><p>I skidded into Johnny Mack\u2019s driveway and had a foot outside before the key was even turned off. I poked at the doorbell three times, then three more for good measure. I\u2019d just started rapping on the wood with my knuckles when the door swung open.</p><p>Damn it if he couldn\u2019t make me pull in an extra breath, even as pissed off and crazed as I was. Standing there fresh from a shower, barefoot, in gray sweatpants and an old faded Navy T-shirt, his frown turned wary as he saw my face.</p><p>\u201cJules, what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>The frown came back. \u201cWhere are\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pictures of him,\u201d I spat, walking in uninvited and pushing past him and his warm aroma of soap and sexiness. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d he asked, closing the door and following behind me. \u201cLook, Shayna told me what my dad said, and I\u2019m sorry. I talked to him about it already.\u201d</p><p>I paced the living room I hadn\u2019t seen in over twenty years, noting that everything was still in the exact same place. Every piece of furniture, every photograph. Even one of Noah and me at the junior prom, me holding my flowers in front of my nonexistent bump. I was surprised he left that one out. It was like stepping back in time. But there was not one new photograph of a boy. Not anywhere.</p><p>\u201cJules,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I wheeled around to face him. \u201cYou had framed pictures of our son in Italy.\u201d</p> <p>Noah blinked and physically moved back a step. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><p>He held his hands up. \u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I want\u2014\u201d My heart was pounding so hard I thought I might pass out. \u201cAre you kidding me? Where are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re packed up. I don\u2019t have a place to live yet, remember?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the hell is going on with you?\u201d</p><p>Why was he so calm? He wasn\u2019t even trying to hide it or deny it.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d I said, braving the distance and grabbing his T-shirt to get his attention. His sharp intake of breath told me I\u2019d gotten it. \u201cHow do you have photos of him?\u201d</p><p>He looked down into my face with the same look Shayna had given me. Like I\u2019d lost my mind. \u201cThe same way you do.\u201d When I just shook my head, he blew out a frustrated breath and pulled free of me. \u201cHang on a second.\u201d</p> <p>He disappeared down a hallway to what I knew must still be his old room and came back seconds later holding his wallet.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d he said, flipping to the photos. \u201cIt\u2019s the same ones\u2014\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath as a face that looked like the male version of Becca when she was little, only with blue eyes, smiled back at me with no front teeth. It swam in front of me as tears reasserted themselves and came forth with a vengeance.</p><p>\u201cJules?\u201d he said, his tone changed.</p><p>\u201cOh, my G\u2014\u201d I choked, taking the wallet from him and touching the photos gingerly as I turned them. \u201cOh, my God, my baby.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I was backing up until I met with solid wall, and once I did I started sliding down it.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa,\u201d Noah said, jumping forward and grabbing me by the upper arms. \u201cHold on, come here.\u201d</p><p>He attempted to pull me to him, but I pushed back. \u201cWhy?\u201d I breathed, turning another and another as the boy got older.</p><p>Seth, Fifth grade was marked on the back of one with neat blue pen.</p><p>\u201cSeth?\u201d I choked. \u201cHis name is Seth? He has a\u2014oh, my God.\u201d It was too much. Suddenly the nameless, faceless little boy I\u2019d mourned for and prayed for the last twenty-six years was a fleshed-out person with a name and a life, and it made the loss even more grueling. \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t have them back to back, I realized through my haze, so he could see the years. Ninth grade, eleventh, a cap and gown picture, a snapshot of him standing next to a pretty girl, looking less like Becca at that point and more like Noah. And the last one, in a policeman\u2019s uniform at an academy graduation, looking very much like Noah, grinning next to two other guys. Men. He was a man now.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014how?\u201d I pushed out. \u201cWhere did these come from?\u201d I sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad sent them,\u201d he said. His hand came to my face and tried to lift my chin but I jerked my face away, not wanting to look away from the little boy I\u2019d last seen when he was two minutes old. \u201cYou have these, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I yelled, the sound more of a wail. \u201cI have nothing!\u201d At his shocked face, I pushed him back and walked the room, pressing his wallet to my chest. I gulped in air, unable to get enough, like something was pulling the oxygen from the room. \u201cHow did he do this?\u201d I asked, turning to face him, begging with my eyes.</p><p>Noah\u2019s face showed a myriad of reactions\u2014confusion, disbelief, questions. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, more to himself than to me.</p><p>\u201cThe adoption was sealed, Noah. No contact. How the hell did he get pictures, and\u2014\u201d A sob took over my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve been here all along. How could he not show me\u2014\u201d</p><p>My knees threatened to give way again, and I spurred myself into motion before the feeling could win. Before I\u2019d let this agony overwhelm me, I had to get the facts. Walking straight to the door, I opened it and headed to my car, Noah\u2019s wallet still held against my chest.</p><p>\u201cJules, wait,\u201d Noah said, springing into action behind me.</p><p>\u201cI have to talk to your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you,\u201d I said, wheeling on him on the sidewalk. \u201cI have a twenty-year-old beef with him that\u2019s about to come to a fucking head right now.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes flared anger that I felt had more to do with my saying I didn\u2019t need him than what I\u2019d said about his father.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to drive,\u201d he said, his voice low and commanding. \u201cGive me your keys, let me put some shoes on, and wait your ass right here.\u201d</p><p>I felt the muscles in my face, my neck, my whole body twitch with adrenaline.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, slamming my keys into his hand.</p><p>I walked around to the passenger side while he glared at me, and then he turned back into the house. I got in and felt the cold quiet sink in around me, my breathing being the loudest thing. I pulled Noah\u2019s wallet away from my chest and started at the beginning. A faded photo that was marked Seth, six months. Just six months after I\u2019d seen him last, it was the closest in resemblance to the baby I remembered.</p><p>\u201cI loved you,\u201d I whispered, sobs shaking my body again. \u201cI always loved you.\u201d</p><p>The driver\u2019s side door opened and Noah got in, grimacing as his knees crammed against the steering column. He adjusted it and shut the door, giving me a look before he started the engine, an odd expression taking over his features.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He shook his head slightly, almost as if that motion, too, were inside his own thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThe last time we were in a car together, you were crying then too.\u201d His eyes met mine. \u201cYou\u2019d already made up your mind.\u201d I looked away, unable to bear looking at him as he said that. \u201cJules, I didn\u2019t know you didn\u2019t have these pictures, too. I wondered when there was nothing at your house, but then\u2014and now with what you told me this morning about your parents pretending it never happened.\u201d He rubbed at his eyes and raked his fingers back through still-damp hair, making his short cut stick up in little dark spikes. \u201cIt all makes sense now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about to make more,\u201d I said.</p><p>I turned back to the pictures, running a finger over the last one, the one of Seth in a policeman\u2019s uniform.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the last one I ever received,\u201d he said, starting the car and putting it in reverse. \u201cThat was about four or five years ago. I guess once he hit twenty-one they stopped sending.\u201d</p><p>Seth looked so much like Noah in that photo, it was like turning back time.</p><p>We were quiet on the drive to the diner. He was right, it was weird being in the car with him again, seeing him at the wheel. Weird and oddly right.</p><p>\u201cWho told you I had photos in Italy?\u201d Noah asked finally when we turned onto the street that flanked the river.</p><p>\u201cI was talking to Shayna at the library,\u201d I said.</p><p>He looked at me with a raised eyebrow. \u201cYou two get along too well.\u201d</p><p>I would have laughed at that another time. If my world hadn\u2019t been upended and the diner wasn\u2019t rolling into view. Instead, every moment of every day that Johnny Mack Ryan had tortured me with his indifference and ugly words came to the surface and spread over me like a giant shield of armor.</p><p>Georgette Pruitt was headed up the sidewalk in our direction, looking purposeful and colorful all in purple. Lord.</p><p>\u201cCan I have my wallet back?\u201d Noah asked as he pulled in a spot and parked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I got out and marched to the door, not caring what my drowned-rat face looked like. Not giving any thought to whether I had dried snot down all my black clothing after the day from hell that had barely made it to one in the afternoon.</p><p>Not caring if Noah was with me or stayed in the car. What I had to say was between me and his father, and probably a diner full of people. So damn be it.</p><p>\u201cJules, I need to talk to\u2014\u201d Georgette called out, upping her steps to catch up to me.</p><p>\u201cGo see Ruthie,\u201d I said, waving her away.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s about the Chamber party,\u201d she said, like that made things different. If I had to hear one more thing about flowers or floats or snowy things, even in a party atmosphere, I was going to do something unladylike.</p><p>\u201cRuthie,\u201d I said, already swinging open the door.</p><p>I saw him immediately. He was out of the kitchen and behind the bar, refilling coffee during a lull. Good. He\u2019d have plenty of time to give me his undivided attention.</p><p>Johnny Mack looked up as I walked in, a scowl clouding his face when he saw it was me before he looked away. Long-buried hurt freshened by recent events stung to the bone.</p><p>I slammed Noah\u2019s wallet down on the counter, pictures facing up. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>He let go of a deep sigh, sounding exhausted. \u201cMaybe you should explain what you\u2019re doing with Noah\u2019s wallet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave it to her,\u201d Noah said from behind me.</p><p>Johnny Mack looked up, surprised. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing with Julianna Doucette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s White now,\u201d I said. \u201cBeen that way for twenty-something years now, did you miss the memo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I told you,\u201d Noah said, his voice carrying that dark demanding something that made people listen. \u201cEnough of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have that sweet Shayna now, boy,\u201d Johnny Mack said. \u201cDon\u2019t go messing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could give a shit who your boy is with now,\u201d I said, my voice rising enough to turn a few heads. I tapped the photos in the wallet. \u201cWe\u2019re not here for that. I want to know why you have these.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your business,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNot my business?\u201d I said, scoffing. \u201cHe\u2019s my son.\u201d</p><p>Johnny Mack shook his head. \u201cYou gave up the right to call him that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said enough!\u201d Noah said, making me jump. He came up to the bar beside me and splayed both hands wide on the counter. \u201cStop being an ass, Dad, it\u2019s beneath you.\u201d</p><p>Johnny Mack\u2019s expression was priceless. Like Noah, not too many people talked to him that way. I watched his jaw muscles work and he sucked in a breath through his nose.</p><p>\u201cI always assumed Jules had these pictures too,\u201d Noah said. Why on earth didn\u2019t you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why you didn\u2019t share them with me,\u201d I said, cutting Noah off, tears burning my eyes and throat again. \u201cYou\u2019ve made that quite clear through the years.\u201d</p><p>I felt Noah\u2019s hand come up to the back of my neck, and I watched Johnny Mack\u2019s eyes narrow as he took it in as well. Just the fact that it bothered him gave me courage.</p><p>\u201cHow could you hate me that much?\u201d I asked, my voice dropping to almost a whisper as I braved out the question I\u2019d wanted to ask for years. Emotion shook my words as they left my mouth. \u201cDo you even remember loving me?\u201d</p><p>He looked like he wanted to chew barbed wire as his eyes made a quick dart around the room. \u201cYou threw that away when you let that boy go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was seventeen,\u201d I said, louder than I intended to, tears tracking down my cheeks. \u201cDoing what my mom and dad said was best to do. I didn\u2019t want it that way, but I was too scared to say no. They sent me to that god-awful place to show me what being a teenage mother would be like, remember? I was fifty different kinds of terrified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have helped you,\u201d he said, sudden emotions coming to his face, mixed with the old anger.</p><p>\u201cUntil I told you no about something,\u201d I said. \u201cUntil I pissed you off. You\u2019re no better than they were. So I did what I did. And everyone left me.\u201d I moved away so that Noah\u2019s hand would drop. \u201cI lost my son, I lost Noah, my parents went in denial, and you spent the next twenty-six years making damn sure I paid for my sins.\u201d I slammed a fist on the counter in front of him. \u201cAnd how dare you insult my daughter today.\u201d</p><p>His mouth worked and then clamped shut before he sighed with irritability. \u201cI was out of line with that comment earlier, I apologize,\u201d he said, staring at coasters on the counter instead of looking at me. It sounded forced, but I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cJules said the adoption was sealed, Dad,\u201d Noah said, laying a hand on his open wallet. \u201cHow\u2019d you pull that off?\u201d</p><p>Johnny Mack grabbed a bar cloth and wiped the length of what he could reach, then gave up with a sigh, rested his hands on the cloth and met my eyes. \u201cYour mother gave them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>For the first time in years, there was no animosity in his eyes. No hate. Just\u2014a giving up of sorts. Giving up my mother. Throwing her under the bus. It wasn\u2019t possible. My mother was controlling and had done many questionable things in the name of \u201ctaking care of people,\u201d but it was too far outside the realm of belief.</p><p>I shook my head as every nerve ending on my body woke up. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>Johnny Mack shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s your choice, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Noah said, moving closer to me again. As if he sensed my impending breakdown.</p><p>Johnny Mack met his son\u2019s gaze and then looked off into the diner, avoiding my hard stare.</p><p>\u201cMary arranged that as part of the adoption,\u201d he said. \u201cThat correspondence and two copies of photographs a year would be sent to her, and her only, until he was twenty-one.\u201d He darted a look my way and then just as quickly feigned interest in his rag. \u201cShe always gave me the second one. I sent them to Noah.\u201d</p><p>The trembling started at my core, like all warmth had left my body. I gripped the counter to stem it, but it just got worse.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2014\u201d Noah began, his voice hoarse. \u201cWhy would they agree to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary set up a trust in his name in exchange for it,\u201d Johnny Mack said, not looking at either of us.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d I shook my head, unable to believe that she would have done that to me.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell Jules about this?\u201d Noah asked, voicing the question I couldn\u2019t seem to push out of my mouth. \u201cOr me, for that matter? I didn\u2019t know any of that. Dad!\u201d he yelled, when Johnny Mack didn\u2019t answer, making the old man jump and turn to face him. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Mary didn\u2019t think she could handle it,\u201d Johnny Mack said with a snarl to his voice and lips. \u201cOkay?\u201d He turned and looked me dead in the eye with both irritation and pity. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to say that out loud, but there, you feel better knowing that? She made me promise not to tell you about the pictures or anything related to the boy. She said it was better for you to move on.\u201d</p><p>My stomach roiled against its contents as every muscle contracted. I grasped Noah\u2019s wallet and backed up, running into a customer who I heard offer apologies but I couldn\u2019t see. All I could see was Johnny Mack\u2019s face, looking at me with something related to remorse, as if saying it all out loud somehow finally highlighted the insanity of it.</p><p>Better for me.</p><p>I sucked in air as what felt like my mother\u2019s final blow knocked the wind from my chest, and as I turned for the door, I suddenly felt weightless. Blackness tinged the edges of my waterlogged vision, sounds of chatter started to echo, and as I reached for the knob it disappeared.</p><p>Arms caught me, wrapping around my middle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d came Noah\u2019s voice against my ear. He held me tight against him, one arm around my waist and one holding my head as sounds started coming back into normal tones. \u201cJust breathe, baby, I\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>He called me baby, I thought, my woozy thoughts swimming around in the delicious aroma that was Noah.</p><p>\u201cI need to go\u2014home,\u201d I managed to say as my feet felt solid floor again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going,\u201d he said, lifting my chin to look at my eyes. \u201cAre you okay to walk?\u201d</p><p>I blinked and nodded and pulled gently away from him, feeling the odd mix of my body coming back to life as my soul shut down. It was the last straw, the last thing my mind was willing to take on, and my heart felt like it turned cold in my chest.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d Johnny Mack said from behind us. \u201cThere\u2019s something I need to tell you. I was going to make it a surprise, but now I think I should tell both of you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it,\u201d Noah snapped before he led me out the door.</p><p>He put me in the car and we drove in silence to my house. I had nothing left. No more tears, thank God, I was completely out of those. Nothing but betrayal and rage coursed through me as we passed the houses I\u2019d seen all my life. As we passed the old one I\u2019d shared with Hayden. That\u2019s where I should have stayed, I realized. I should have sold Mom\u2019s house when she died and stayed where we were. Away from the negativity and rules and controlling influence that her house still held over me.</p><p>She had ruined my life.</p><p>We pulled into the driveway, and I stared at the house I now despised with everything in my being.</p><p>Noah\u2019s phone sang \u201cLove Shack\u201d and he hit the button to silence it.</p><p>\u201cShayna?\u201d I asked, and he nodded. \u201cYou can call her back.\u201d</p><p>He texted something quickly. \u201cTold her I\u2019ll call her back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have brought you home,\u201d I said, not recognizing the hollow sound of my words, my voice.</p><p>Noah shook his head and handed me the keys. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you here alone,\u201d he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. \u201cI\u2019ll walk the two blocks later if I have to.\u201d</p><p>My phone buzzed from my purse and I dug it out to see Becca asking to spend the night with Lizzy. Not a shocker. And probably a good idea, considering my mood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good company right now,\u201d I said, eyeing the house as if my mother were standing on the porch.</p><p>Ignoring me, he got out and walked around to my side, where I still sat, and opened my door. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>I swung my legs out and stood, letting him shut the door behind me as I walked up to a place that didn\u2019t feel like mine anymore. Not that it ever really had, but I was at least making headway. Now none of that mattered. My mother still lived there. Working me like a puppet, just as Noah had said.</p><p>I unlocked the door, hearing and feeling him behind me, and heard the ka-thunk of Harley jumping off the couch.</p><p>\u201cHey, my Harley girl,\u201d I said as she wiggled over to me, swinging her giant tail. I felt love and relief seep back through for just a second as her unconditional love melted my heart a little. I knelt and buried my face in her neck. \u201cYou and the girl child are the only things that make this home,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>Standing as Harley then made her way to Noah to get bonus points, I kicked off my shoes and looked around the room at all I had done to try and make it our home. It was lipstick on a pig, as Nana Mae would say. Nothing changed the guts of the thing. I narrowed my eyes as I scanned the room with a different perspective.</p><p>Somewhere in these guts were photos of Seth. Hidden away because I couldn\u2019t handle it. I clenched my teeth together at the anger those words fired up in me. Photos and correspondence, whatever the hell that could be. But how? We\u2019d gone through every possible drawer and file, both at the house and at the bookstore, when she died. And then many of the older pieces of furniture had been put to the street in favor of ours. I couldn\u2019t imagine what I could have missed\u2014</p><p>My eyes landed on the bookshelf. Or rather, my mother\u2019s corner of it. The section I never really touched, but pretty much just jammed together to make room for my own things.</p><p>Walking slowly to it, I stared, adrenaline boiling my blood as I remembered my mother lying in a hospital bed telling Becca and me that she loved us and never mentioning one word about \u201cOh, by the way, there\u2019s something kind of important you might want to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bitch,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cJules,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Noah,\u201d I said, hearing the shake in my voice as the irony spread through my system like poison. \u201cMy mother sent my son away, cutting all contact for me but holding on to it for herself.\u201d I turned to face him, my whole head feeling like the top of a volcano. \u201cFor herself. She still had a grandchild, but I couldn\u2019t be a moth\u2014\u201d My words gave way as my chest pushed the air from my lungs. \u201cShe gave it to your dad to send to you on the other side of the world, but couldn\u2019t share it with her own daughter, right here in the same house.\u201d</p><p>He just met my gaze and didn\u2019t say anything. There was nothing to say.</p><p>\u201cShe knew his name,\u201d I said, the rage bringing tears back to my throat. \u201cFor years I\u2019ve wondered how your dad could hate me so much, and now I have to wonder how my own mother could have so little fucking faith in me.\u201d</p><p>Noah moved toward me but I turned around. Turned to stare at her books and her beloved atlases and precious antique glassware. All collecting dust because I never did more than hit it with a feather duster. I never liked being around it. I always assumed that was due to so many unresolved, unfinished issues with my mother. Or my own guilt over the resentment I felt. Whatever the reasons, I left her things alone.</p><p>I pulled a book out, flipped through it, and set it on the floor. Pulled out another one and did the same. Again and again, thick atlases and small books. I moved the glassware to other shelves, and Noah silently picked up the books and began making stacks as I pulled faster and faster, not caring about what they were. Harley sniffed each one tentatively and would then look up at me with her little forehead creased like she wanted to understand the game but wasn\u2019t catching on.</p><p>I kept tossing and Noah kept organizing, and if he didn\u2019t know what I was doing, he didn\u2019t say. And although I originally didn\u2019t want him there, I found myself glad to not be alone.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>Two thick volumes on astronomy stuck together as I tried to pull one out. Rather grossed out, thinking something nasty had bonded them together over time, I tried to pry them apart to no avail.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I said, garnering Noah\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are stuck, they\u2019re\u2014\u201d I stopped short when I picked them up with two hands and felt the movement within. I stared at the books in my hand, looking closer at the seam between them. Bound with super glue.</p><p>My Nana Mae\u2019s words about my mother\u2019s teenage rebellion sung softly in my ear. \u201c. . . carving out old books to hide things like letters from boys\u2014and her daddy\u2019s cigarettes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I whispered, fighting against the burn that wanted to take me under. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJules, what is it?\u201d Noah asked, coming to stand beside me, his hand resting on the shelf as he looked down.</p><p>I opened the hard cardboard cover, and there it was. My past, my big never-talk-about-it secret. All the things I was never trusted to handle.</p><p>A large cavern had been carved into the two books, leaving only an inch of paper around the edges. In the hole were photographs and letters, and something that appeared to be bank statements.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Noah breathed.</p> <p>I put a trembling hand inside and pulled out a handful of photos. One fell free and I knelt to pick it up. My breath caught as I saw it wasn\u2019t one that was in Noah\u2019s collection. It was of a man and woman, smiling, holding an infant.</p><p>My infant.</p><p>A noise escaped my throat and the book box and other photos slipped from my hand. Noah dropped to one knee when I melted into a sitting position.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I held out the picture, one hand over my mouth as if that would hold all the crazy in, and I heard him swear under his breath.</p> <p>\u201cThat had to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight after,\u201d I finished.</p><p>The image swam before my eyes and I kept blinking it clear, needing to see the people that raised my child. That taught him to say Mommy and Daddy and how to ride a bike. That kissed his hurts and hugged him through his successes, and made him a man.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Noah said, rising in one movement and walking away a few steps, running fingers over his eyes. His breathing was louder, and I looked up to see him go stand in front of my painting, bracing one hand on the wall. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen them before,\u201d he said, his voice low.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess my mother didn\u2019t quite share everything, huh?\u201d I said, tears coming freely once I finally let them have their way.</p><p>He drew in a long, labored breath and blew it out slowly, running another hand over his face before he turned back around. When he came back he slid his back down the wall and sat facing me. I sat cross-legged in my black leggings and wraparound black skirt, not caring. After a long look he picked up the box and positioned it between us. We each pulled things out and explored, reading letters written in longhand from Seth\u2019s\u2014mother. We touched crayon drawings and read his first poem. We looked over more snapshots of Seth and another boy, presumably a brother? Noah hadn\u2019t seen those either, and we looked until there was nothing left.</p> <p>I leaned over onto my elbows with my face in my hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Noah,\u201d I said into them.</p><p>He was only a foot away and pulled my hands from my face. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis should have been our family,\u201d I said, though very little sound went with the words. I was so tired, so wrung out, that even crying was too much effort. \u201cMy mother took that away and I let her do it.\u201d My chin trembled, although I felt dried up. \u201cWe could have been a family.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes looked exhausted too, like he just wanted to sleep. He sat against the wall in his sweats and T-shirt with one knee up and the other leg sprawled out.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, putting his knee down.</p><p>The look on his face told me not to argue. I scooted up so that my cross-legged position had my knees resting on top of his. It was kind of intimate, and him still holding my hands didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cYou have a family, Jules,\u201d he said, his voice soft but his expression still haunted by all that we\u2019d seen. \u201cEverything happens the way it\u2019s supposed to happen.\u201d He squeezed my hands tighter. \u201cYou had Becca. Seth\u2019s parents got to raise a great kid they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>A stricken look passed over his face before he glazed it over, burying it forever. \u201cI got to\u2014make the world a safer place for them.\u201d</p><p>The stab to my heart was physical, and I winced.</p><p>\u201cI used to think about you when I was out in the field,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and Seth.\u201d He looked down at our hands. \u201cI\u2019d imagine what he was doing. What you were doing\u2014\u201d At my look of doubt, he added, \u201cYes, even though I was angry, I still thought about you.\u201d</p><p>The scar in his eyebrow twitched as he frowned. I wanted to smooth it, touch his face more than anything in the world right then.</p><p>\u201cYou two were what kept me human,\u201d he said in a whisper. \u201cWhen what I was doing\u2014\u201d He stopped and his whole face tightened and his eyes went dark. \u201cWasn\u2019t very human.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and forced his expression to clear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d think about the moment he was born,\u201d he said. \u201cYour face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord,\u201d I said.</p><p>He smiled and moved a lock of my hair out of my face, temporarily stopping my heart. \u201cIt was beautiful.\u201d He held my hand up between us and held tighter. \u201cYou had my hand in a vise, begging me not to let go. I promised I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said, the smile in his eyes fading.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you did,\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>He inhaled slow and deep, nailing me with that thousand-mile stare of his. \u201cAnd then I did.\u201d He looked physically pained by that admission. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I left you alone, Jules. I swore to be by your side and then I left you to carry this by yourself.\u201d</p><p>I gave him a small smile. \u201cEverything happens as it\u2019s supposed to happen,\u201d I said, and one side of his lips spread into a smile that turned my insides to a churning ball of energy.</p><p>I lost my resolve not to touch him with that smile, and I moved my hand softly over his cheek. Noah sucked in a breath and closed his eyes when I touched him. My breath quickened at the new rush of adrenaline that shot through me, and the look of surrender that heated his eyes when he opened them sent a new burst of nerves buzzing through my belly.</p><p>Both his hands came up to my face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I breathed, confused and spinning.</p><p>Pulling me to him as he leaned in, he nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t hold this in anymore.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s mouth landed on mine with a sweet hunger that made my bones feel as though they left me entirely. Energy pulsed through me like lightning at the feel of his mouth, the taste of him, his hands twisting into my hair. It was like I\u2019d been starving for him and one taste triggered everything. My hands went up into his short hair, pulling his head in deeper and bringing a low rumbled growl from his chest that set me on fire. I couldn\u2019t get close enough.</p><p>As if he felt the same need, he pulled me into his lap, my legs straddling him as he shoved my skirt up so that I\u2019d fit against him better. Our foreheads pressed together and the tears that filled his eyes stung my core. Suddenly my lungs, my eyes, my throat\u2014everything burned with the emotion of needing him so badly I couldn\u2019t breathe. His arms moved up my back and pulled me so impossibly tight that when I wrapped my arms around his head and he buried his face in my neck, we clung to each other as if our lives depended on it.</p><p>I felt his hot tears on my skin, and it brought all the injustice of the years we lost to the surface. Nothing felt more right than being intertwined so tightly we were one, rocking slowly, desperately clinging to each other.</p><p>The only thing that pulled me from that embrace was my need for his mouth. I was shaking when I held his face in my hands and saw the rawness in his eyes. I landed back on his lips, exploring his mouth, tasting the salt from our tears.</p><p>He dug his fingers into my back as his mouth trailed down to my neck, sending tingles to all the important places. His hands moved from my thighs slowly back up to my hair, lighting up every inch that they passed.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Noah,\u201d I part whispered, part moaned, as I felt him hard against me and moved my hands over his shoulders, his back, his head again. I couldn\u2019t get enough. \u201cI can\u2019t stop touching you,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d he said, shoving my sweater jacket off my shoulders and landing there with his mouth, tasting his way up my neck. Reflexively, my thighs squeezed and I arched against him, making him moan against my skin and dig his fingers into my hair. His kisses went lower, playing at the swell of my tank top neckline while holding me firmly against him, driving me mad.</p><p>A tiny voice in the back of my mind was screaming to be heard, telling me to stop. Telling me that it was a bad idea. Telling me that my heart couldn\u2019t take another Noah heartbreak.</p><p>But the rest of me was louder. Every cell of my being went on full alert as his hands moved over my body and I felt his need matching mine. I held his face against my chest and moved against him as his breathing grew ragged and he grabbed my ass and rode it with me. He let go and slid his hands up over my breasts to my face, searching my eyes as we both breathed as if we were racing. As if sensing the runaway freight train we\u2019d climbed on was about to jump the tracks. The intensity hit me to the bone, filling me with a need that burned my eyes.</p><p>\u201cJules.\u201d</p><p>I saw everything in that one second, everything he couldn\u2019t say, everything he\u2019d ever felt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Noah blinked back emotion, and when his mouth sealed over mine again it was solid, real, like a promise. He explored my mouth, pulling me deeper and deeper, my mind exploding with the thoughts that this was Noah. That I was kissing Noah again. Touching him.</p><p>\u201cHold on to me,\u201d he said against my lips, gripping me against him with one arm.</p><p>I wrapped myself around him as he lifted and pulled his legs under him, picking me up a little awkwardly and dropping me on the rug.</p><p>I pulled him down with me. \u201cNice move.\u201d</p><p>A smile curved his lips. \u201cI\u2019m slowing in my old age.\u201d</p><p>He dove into my mouth once more, hungry, needing. I wound my legs around him and pulled him down to me, craving the weight of his body on mine. He was so much more solid than the last time I\u2019d held him like this. Tighter, harder. His kiss turned possessive, pinning me to the floor, taking my breath away with his ardor. Making me dizzy with my need for more. I tugged at his T-shirt, wanting skin, and he lifted so that I could pull it over his head.</p><p>God, he was glorious. I wanted to lick every inch of his torso, but my current position under him didn\u2019t allow that, so I settled for a shoulder as my hands kneaded his back. I didn\u2019t get much of that, however, as he was on a mission. Torturing me in a delicious rhythm, Noah dragged his mouth down my neck back to my breasts, lifting my tank top and sinking his face between them. His mouth made love to my cleavage while he pushed between my legs in a slow pulsing tease. My little black leggings and his sweatpants didn\u2019t provide much in the way of restriction, so the mock lovemaking had me gasping for breath within minutes.</p><p>His fingers worked one thigh up and down until he\u2019d cup my ass and grind himself into me. It was insane, the power he had over my senses. He had me almost blind with desire, digging my nails into his back with each thrust. Then he moved down, kissing my belly and untying my bunched up skirt in seconds, following his hands with his mouth as he pulled off my leggings in one move and kissed his way back up one thigh.</p><p>\u201cMmm, Jules,\u201d he murmured against my skin.</p><p>I arched and grabbed his head as he lingered over my lacy panties, his hot breath on the fabric nearly finishing me off.</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d I breathed, barely able to form the words. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He could have yanked them down and had his way with me, but he didn\u2019t. Instead, he made the trip back up, kissed the inside of each breast, and then moved to suck a nipple through the straining fabric of my bra, grabbing my leg and pushing himself against me again.</p><p>I groaned and moved with him, feeling him tremble against me.</p><p>\u201cKeep doing that,\u201d I said between breaths. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll undo me. I\u2019m so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been undone for three days,\u201d he growled against my neck.</p><p>His next thrust put us face-to-face. His hands framed my face and his eyes bored into me with that look of his that turned my insides to mush. I was hopeless for him. Again. And I was ready to give him everything again. I raked my nails down his back to his ass, pulling him with me on the next one and sliding his sweatpants downward.</p><p>Just as his cell phone rang.</p><p>With \u201cLove Shack.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Everything froze.</p><p>Our eyes locked as the song played out, neither one of us moving a muscle, like that would hide us from the woman behind it. As it fell silent and reality seeped into every breath, there was a five-second moment when harsh awakenings landed hard. Noah closed his eyes and rested his forehead against mine, letting go of my leg as I pulled his pants back up and let my arms fall to the sides.</p><p>I was mortified.</p><p>We broke our own rules. I had given in, heart, mind, body and soul\u2014again. To a man who wasn\u2019t mine to give it to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Noah said, under his breath, not lifting his head. His skin was hot against mine, or maybe that was just me projecting my own shame.</p><p>My body still ached with frustration and didn\u2019t want him to get up. I wanted to stay wrapped up in him. But more than that, my heart ached over the walls I\u2019d let him knock down.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI am not this person. I\u2019m not this woman.\u201d</p><p>Noah lifted his head from mine and rolled to the side, making me instantly chilled and vulnerable. I sat up and pulled my tank top down, scooting backward to lean against the back of the couch and pulling the afghan into my lap. Noah watched my movements with a narrowed gaze, leaning on one elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhat woman would that be?\u201d he asked, his voice low and controlled.</p><p>I covered my face with my hands. \u201cOne that sleeps with a pregnant woman\u2019s future husband.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t do this. I don\u2019t even almost do this.\u201d</p><p>He sat up facing me and pulled a hand away, holding on to it.</p><p>\u201cIs that all it felt like to you? Sex?\u201d he asked, raising an eyebrow. \u201cBecause I was in a very different place.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and clenched my jaws tight to fend off the hurt in my chest. Remembering the connection we\u2019d just had and the total surrender of my heart, the tender places in there that hadn\u2019t been touched in twenty-six years. My hand fisted at my stomach like I could hold it all in if I pushed hard enough.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that,\u201d he said, putting his hand over mine, making me open my eyes to look into his. \u201cThat right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d I said, my voice choking on his name.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Minutes that felt like slow motion passed as we sat and breathed and wallowed in misery.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s become my friend, Noah,\u201d I said, wiping my face with the afghan.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said again. \u201cAnd I feel like the world\u2019s biggest fucking prick right now. But it doesn\u2019t change\u2014\u201d He closed his eyes and ran his free hand over his face, squeezing mine tighter. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change that I\u2019ve thought of nothing but you since I got back to town, Jules. Last night, it was everything I could do not to pull you out of his arms on that dance floor.\u201d</p><p>The memory of his eyes on me, raw and angry, made me swallow hard. I had to stay resilient.</p><p>\u201cShayna\u2019s a good person,\u201d I said, hearing the shake in my voice and begging God to take that away. I was tired of crying. I was tired of feeling weak. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour baby doesn\u2019t deserve this,\u201d I managed to add, the words coming slow and deliberate. The burn fed through me and I prayed for the numbness to come. It had come before, it could do it again. \u201cWe have to live in this town together, Noah.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and nodded, looking beaten down.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let this happen again,\u201d I said, the last word having to be choked out.</p><p>He opened his eyes slowly, fixing me with that unblinking gaze of his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the pictures, Jules. And my dad. And\u2014\u201d He gestured behind him to the box and other pictures on the floor. \u201cYour mom. I\u2019m sorry about everything you\u2019ve had to deal with. But I\u2019ll never be sorry for getting to find out a little more about my son today.\u201d He took a deep, shaky breath and threaded his fingers through mine. \u201cOr about this.\u201d</p><p>All I could hear was the echo of those warnings that had been yelling at me earlier. The ones I\u2019d ignored while Noah Ryan was feeling me up.</p><p>\u201cI know that makes me a dick with Shayna,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut having you in my arms again\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, cutting him off. Not wanting to hear more words that I\u2019d just replay again and again later. \u201cIt can\u2019t\u2014\u201d I looked away and clenched my jaws tight to hold back the pain that wanted out. The tears that somehow found a way to flow yet again. I pulled myself together before looking at him again. \u201cI can\u2019t do this again, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and searched my eyes for more, but it really just came down to that.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know all the details with me and Shayna, Jules,\u201d he began. \u201cWe don\u2019t have what you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat you have is a child. Everything you\u2019ve ever wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d he said under his breath, his whole body teaming with tension. I could see his muscles twitching in his neck and shoulders, and his still being shirtless wasn\u2019t helping me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think like that. \u201cI broke\u2014everything today,\u201d I said. \u201cEvery promise, every rule, every\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises to who?\u201d Noah demanded.</p><p>\u201cMyself,\u201d I said, bitter laughter bubbling to the surface. \u201cI\u2019ve spent two decades living behind lines I never crossed. Twenty years of holding back, not giving my heart completely, not even to my husband. Not ever wanting to feel crushed like that again. And fifteen minutes with you blew all that away.\u201d</p><p>Sharp emotion flashed in his eyes before he pulled it back. \u201cBecause you gave me your heart.\u201d</p><p>The memory of that embrace and the tears in his eyes stabbed me in the chest. That would have been the moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be with you any other way,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>My chest felt so tight it was hard to pull in air. \u201cYou need to go, Noah,\u201d I added, softer. I tried to pull my hand free but he wasn\u2019t letting go. I pleaded with my eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to let go,\u201d he said.</p><p>He spoke so softly I barely heard him. But those words coupled with the devastation in his eyes nearly buckled me.</p><p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d I said, wondering where the words were coming from. \u201cYour family\u2019s at home.\u201d</p><p>His family. I saw it hit the mark.</p><p>He looked down at our hands, and when I pulled mine free he didn\u2019t resist. Taking a deep breath to stem off the stab that sent through me, I got to my feet. It was easier to keep moving, and I tossed the afghan aside and quickly pulled my castaway leggings back right-side out and stepped into them. It was acceptable enough without fumbling with the skirt and sweater; I basically looked ready to go to the gym. I found his shirt and handed it to him as he rose, ignoring the flutter in my stomach at the full-standing, shirtless view.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, not looking at me. He tugged it on in one movement.</p><p>\u201cNeed me to drive you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll walk,\u201d he said. His tone had changed. He\u2019d gone under, shutting it down. That was a move I understood too well. \u201cI probably need the walk,\u201d he added, attempting to soften it some.</p><p>I crossed my arms and rubbed them, feeling chilled, and when our eyes locked my heart broke for the eighty-third time that day. It was unreal to think that we\u2019d just been entwined in each other\u2019s arms only moments earlier, and I ached for it.</p><p>The second ringing of his cell broke the moment. I vowed then and there to never listen to \u201cLove Shack\u201d again.</p><p>\u201cBye, Noah,\u201d I said, hearing the wobble in my voice.</p><p>I lifted my chin to help counteract it and turned to walk into the kitchen, waiting for it. When I heard the front door open and close, I gripped the granite of the island, focusing hard on the cold, wanting the frigid rock to ice down my blood.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t enough, however. Short of diving into a lake of ice, nothing would push back the fiery pain that threatened to engulf me. I\u2019d let it in. I\u2019d let him in. In the days since his return, I\u2019d broken every personal rule and boundary I\u2019d ever set for myself.</p><p>I gulped for air as the sobs came, and I didn\u2019t fight them. I was tired of fighting them, tired of crying so much. That wasn\u2019t me. But it felt like I\u2019d spent the last week holding it all in.</p><p>I grabbed a Coke from the fridge and held it to the back of my neck as I walked back into the living room. I stopped short, staring at the floor by the bookshelf. Books were everywhere, papers and pictures lying askew. And the rug where we\u2019d nearly done the deed. How much worse would that have been? Or would it? Did it really matter that we hadn\u2019t finished?</p><p>I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d let love into sex. With Hayden, of course, but even in all those years of marriage\u2014not heart-and-soul kind of love.</p><p>Noah had pulled that from me with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I cried, dropping to my knees on the rug and letting whatever needed to come, come. I curled up in a ball like I\u2019d done so many years ago. All the brokenness seemed to come at once, like moths to light.</p><p>Harley bounded down the stairs a half hour later, pausing when she saw me on the rug, as if not quite sure what to do with that. Lord, I\u2019d forgotten about Harley once we got started. She must have decided she didn\u2019t want to watch and bolted for Becca\u2019s room.</p><p>She padded down the last few steps and wagged over to me, licking my face and probably wondering if all this floor activity was some new game. She sprawled on the floor for a belly rub, her legs splayed wide.</p><p>\u201cSlut,\u201d I said, my voice still thick with crying.</p><p>She didn\u2019t care. I lay down next to her and rubbed her till her head lolled to the side and her eyes closed. I envied her that. The ability to shut it all down, whenever and wherever. I buried my face against her side and let myself float.</p><p>The front door opening was unplanned.</p><p>I jumped at the sound and movement and light streaming in, not to mention Harley\u2019s full-flail awkward attempt at getting her feet back under her to get to Becca.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Blinking my swollen and salt-logged eyes open, I saw a hazy Becca.</p><p>\u201cShit, I must have fallen asleep,\u201d I mumbled.</p><p>\u201cOn the floor?\u201d she said, kneeling beside me. \u201cAre you sick?\u201d She peered closer at me. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, I wish,\u201d I said, grabbing my head as the crying headache took root.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened here?\u201d she said, looking behind her. \u201cWhy are all the books on the floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you home?\u201d I asked, sitting up and suddenly realizing the near horrendous situation we\u2019d have had if she\u2019d walked in like that an hour earlier.</p><p>\u201cCame to get different clothes,\u201d she said, distracted. \u201cMom, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Leaning over, she picked up a photograph of Seth when he was around her age. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and scooted over to where the majority of the pictures lay in a pile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014 \u201d I began, my heart picking up speed. \u201cYour brother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>Becca froze mid-lean, dropping the photograph like it stung her.</p><p>Yeah, this was going to be fun. I rubbed at my cry-swollen eyes and pointed at the floor.</p><p>\u201cPull up some rug, Bec, I have a story to tell you.\u201d She looked at me like I\u2019d lost my mind, still frozen in her awkward position. \u201cSit,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a brother,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d She shook her head and smirked at me. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, sit down,\u201d I said again, needing a calm heart-to-heart and quickly realizing that opportunity had come and gone. My eyes filled with tears again\u2014how that was possible, I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Becca scoffed and stared at me, bracing herself on the wall as if she needed proof of reality. \u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the photos on the floor, and I watched a mixed look of horror and hurt cross her face as the family resemblance registered. I pushed to my feet, her shock pushing away the rest of my day. I needed to make this okay for her. I tucked an errant piece of longer hair behind her ear and smoothed the rest, my heart thumping loudly in my ears.</p><p>\u201cBaby, we need to talk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think?\u201d she said, tears thickening her voice. \u201cYou\u2014did I miss something? Like you being pregnant, maybe? I mean\u2014how do you have another kid my age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your age,\u201d I said. My tongue felt thick and heavy. \u201cHe\u2019s twenty-six.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shot up to meet mine, and it broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six,\u201d she said, just above a whisper. \u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>It felt odd to answer that question, it still being so new to me. \u201cSeth,\u201d I said, wrapping my brain around the sound of it.</p><p>She nodded and glanced back down. \u201cAnd\u2014I didn\u2019t know I had a brother named Seth because\u2014?\u201d</p> <p>I knelt to scoop everything up. \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to talk to you about, Becca. Let\u2019s go sit down\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I stood up, my arms full of photos I was itching to look through again myself.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She blinked tears free and whisked them away as if embarrassed to let me see it. Like I\u2019d never seen her cry before. A bitter laugh came out like a cough.</p><p>\u201cLizzy is waiting outside in the car, Mom. I just came in to change clothes. And find you asleep\u2014on the floor with Harley\u2014clearly on a crying hangover. And now I have a brother?\u201d she said, her voice progressively louder. \u201cWhat the fuck, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecca!\u201d I exclaimed, stunned by the sound of that word coming from her.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said, tilting her head in a very Ruthie-like manner, gesturing in circles at the photos at her feet. \u201cMy language is what disturbs you most in all that?\u201d</p> <p>Hide your crazy.</p><p>The pounding in my skull stepped it up a couple of beats. \u201cGo tell Lizzy to come back in an hour. I\u2019m sorry this is dumped on you like this, but that\u2019s the kind of day it\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>She widened her eyes. \u201cThe kind of day? I just saw you at the library a couple of hours ago, Mom. Delivering books. Talking to some lady. How do you go from that to\u2014this?\u201d She pointed to the mess in my arms. \u201cHow is this okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d I asked. I looked at the floor and back at her. \u201cLook at me. Do I look okay to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why now?\u201d she said, waving her arms. \u201cHow could you not tell me my whole life that I have\u2014where is he, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as more tears fell. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d She scooped her hair back and let it fall. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d I echoed. \u201cI never even saw these pictures until today,\u201d I said, irritability bringing my own burn back to my eyes. \u201cMy mother\u2014\u201d I took a deep breath and let it go. \u201cMy mother had these hidden away.\u201d</p><p>Becca\u2019s eyes narrowed, disbelief all over her features. \u201cWhy would she do that? Why wasn\u2019t he here? Why would Dad let\u2014\u201d</p><p>I was already shaking my head, trying to reach for her but she pulled away. And backed up a step, pointing a finger at me.</p><p>\u201cDad wasn\u2019t the dad, was he?\u201d she breathed.</p><p>My throat felt like it was closing up. Nothing was going like I\u2019d hoped. Not that I\u2019d hoped any of it. I\u2019d hidden my life in a box just like my mother had.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she said, raking her fingers through her hair. She turned and headed up three steps before turning back to me, disgust contorting her features. \u201cYou cheated on Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cIt was years before I met your father.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders sagged. \u201cYears before?\u201d she said, bewilderment adding to the gamut of emotions on her face.</p><p>Then it cleared. The knit between her eyebrows smoothed as I watched her wheels turn and everything I\u2019d dreaded worked out in her head. She did the math. Nana Mae was right. I should have told her long ago. When she was eight and having a mysterious brother would have been cool, and I wouldn\u2019t be a horrible troll.</p><p>\u201cIf you had a kid twenty-six years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cYou would have been eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Oh, my math-challenged baby girl. My chin trembled, but I refused to have yet another breakdown today. I held my head up and tried my best to keep up the parent role, although I was beginning to feel more like the child.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a shaky breath and shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re such a hypocrite.\u201d With that, she wheeled around and stomped up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I said, my voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cTo change my clothes,\u201d she said, disappearing over the top and slamming her door.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered, pressing my palms against my pounding temples. Harley sat on the bottom step, looking upward, and I lowered myself to the one above her. \u201cThis went well, don\u2019t you think?\u201d I asked her.</p><p>I needed to tell her the whole thing so she\u2019d get it. So she\u2019d understand my choices and my reasons\u2014but who was I kidding? Becca wasn\u2019t going to understand those things. Ever. You had to live it, and even then I wasn\u2019t totally clear on it. And I never wanted her to have to make the decisions I\u2019d made.</p><p>Two minutes later, changed into all black\u2014clearly the wardrobe choice of the day\u2014and eyeliner fixed from her momentary emotional slip, Becca came charging down the stairs. Her expression was cold and glazed over.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving right now, Bec,\u201d I said, sitting there with Harley like we were some sort of wall.</p><p>\u201cThe hell I\u2019m not,\u201d she said, her face never breaking its mask.</p><p>Oh, how she knew what buttons to push to piss me off. I rose in one move, and even Harley seemed to catch the mood. She got up and headed out back through her doggie door, not wanting any part of the scene about to ensue.</p><p>\u201cI told you we need to talk,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI told you I have plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t tell me anything, Becca,\u201d I said, raising my voice. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t talk to me this way. As long as you live in my house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t,\u201d she said, glaring at me. \u201cI\u2019ll go live with Dad.\u201d</p><p>My blood felt like it was on fire. The classic manipulative tool in every divorce kid\u2019s arsenal. She\u2019d never played it before.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d I said softly. \u201cBut be damn sure of your decision, because you only get to use that card with me once.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glazed over again. \u201cWhatever. I don\u2019t care what you say anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecca Ann, I know you\u2019re upset right now,\u201d I said, trying to rein my own anger in. She knew how to light me up and seemed hell-bent on pushing me to the limit. \u201cBut you watch your mouth. You are not my equal, young lady. Remember your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d she yelled. \u201cOnly child? Second child? Daughter to a lying hypocrite?\u201d</p><p>Fire blazed hot in my brain and my hand came up before I could stop it. The smack across her cheek made us both suck in our breaths. I felt like my eyes were as wide as hers as we stared at each other in disbelief, neither of us breathing.</p><p>I\u2019d never hit her before. Not like that. Not in anger. She\u2019d gotten swats on her hands or bottom when she was little and being disciplined, but I\u2019d never slapped her like that.</p><p>Her eyes filled with tears again as she palmed her cheek, and everything in me broke. The day descended on me with the weight of a tank, crushing any resolve I had left. A sob escaped my throat and I gripped the stairway railing.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d I choked out, emotion taking me over.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move, just stood there, shocked and crying silently, holding her cheek. I shut my eyes and clamped a hand over my mouth, wanting the stairs to open up and swallow me. To take me away somewhere dark where I could come apart in solitude, where I wouldn\u2019t have witnesses and couldn\u2019t wreck anyone else\u2019s lives.</p><p>\u201cLeave,\u201d I said through my fingers, my sobs pulling the last bit of energy from me.</p><p>Finally, she moved. Slowly, robotically, she stepped around me, sniffling. Walked out the door, closing it behind her with a click.</p><p>The silence rang in my ears as I sank to my knees on the steps and let it rip me apart.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I woke to the sound of the dead bolt clicking into place and opened my eyes. Or tried to. They were so swollen and glued together that it took prying one open with my fingers to do the job. I rubbed it to focus better and hit the button to light up my phone.</p><p>Ten minutes after midnight.</p><p>\u201cBecca?\u201d I called out, my voice hoarse to my ears.</p><p>A hazy form stopped at the foot of the stairs. \u201cMom? Why are you on the couch?\u201d</p><p>I struggled to sit up as my feet were tangled under the afghan, another blanket, and Harley\u2019s back end. Becca\u2019s voice got her attention, however, and she jumped off the couch still groggy, nearly face-planting into the floor. I guessed that as long as a burglar was quiet and didn\u2019t talk, Harley would sleep through it.</p><p>\u201cI must have fallen asleep,\u201d I said, pushing myself upright. The side table lamp was on, illuminating the stacks of photos and letters I\u2019d been looking through all evening. Five Dr. Pepper cans were lined up next to them, as well as a bag of chips and a nearly empty package of Oreos I hadn\u2019t even known we had.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m home,\u201d she said, turning back to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were spending the night at Lizzy\u2019s,\u201d I said, trying to rub both eyes open.</p><p>Actually, I didn\u2019t know what she was going to do. My fear of her never coming back home after that escapade had me breathing a sigh of relief that she was standing in the living room.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t feel like it,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her voice sounded down.</p><p>\u201cCome sit down?\u201d I asked.</p><p>I heard the sigh I couldn\u2019t really see. \u201cMom, I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come sit,\u201d I said. She couldn\u2019t possibly be more tired than me. I felt like I\u2019d been to New Zealand and back. By paddleboat. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Becca trudged around the couch and landed next to me with a long exhale. She looked my way for what was probably intended to be just a quick glance, but then she did a double take.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Mom, what happened to your eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you, it was a bitch of a day,\u201d I said. \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fell on the stack of Seth\u2019s photos next to me, then down to her lap and back at the stack. \u201cAny Oreos left?\u201d</p><p>I reached back for the package and shook it. \u201cA few.\u201d I handed it to her and she shoved her hand inside.</p><p>\u201cYou really just see all that today?\u201d she asked, nodding her chin at the photos.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d that happen?\u201d</p><p>There was still snark in her voice, but a little remorse, too. That was her way of fixing things. Talking around them.</p><p>I rubbed at my face, too exhausted to start up the fight again. \u201cDo you want the long version or the summary?\u201d</p><p>She met my eyes and then looked away. There was still hurt in her eyes, and my stomach tightened.</p><p>\u201cCliffsNotes is fine.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cHe was put up for adoption the second he was born, my fianc\u00e9 left town, and my parents pretended it never happened. Now the guy is back, I found out he had photographs\u2014today. He said they came from his dad. I approached the dad and he told me they came from my mother.\u201d Becca\u2019s eyebrows rose at my rambling summary, and I gestured toward the pictures on the table. \u201cHence my raid on Mom\u2019s part of the bookshelf.\u201d</p><p>In the dim light, I watched her eyes glisten and she blinked it back, averting her gaze to stare straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you keep all this from me?\u201d she whispered, but I could hear the shake.</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell her that it was to protect her, but I realized we were past the point of either one of us believing that.</p><p>\u201cIt was so before your time, Bec,\u201d I said, the pain and guilt and rawness wrapping around my throat, choking the words as they came out. \u201cA really, really difficult time for me. Something I don\u2019t talk about\u2014with anyone. I guess I hoped you\u2019d never have to know that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you weren\u2019t perfect?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat I made horrible choices,\u201d I said, tears rising in my throat. \u201cYou called me a hypocrite and you\u2019re right. I did the very thing I\u2019m begging you not to do, and I was in love and thought it was all okay, and then I had to choose between\u2014\u201d I shut my eyes tight against the words that nearly came out. I was about to say choose between my mother and my love. Oh, holy fuck, no wonder Noah had left me. What I\u2019d convinced myself to be a responsible decision, he\u2019d seen as betrayal. I sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cI had to make choices that I couldn\u2019t take back. Like never knowing my son.\u201d</p><p>I felt her eyes on the side of my face, but it was my turn to stare straight ahead. I couldn\u2019t look at my daughter and say these things aloud.</p><p>\u201cI never want you to have to make choices like that, Bec,\u201d I said. \u201cThings you can\u2019t undo. Like painting over a mistake\u2014it doesn\u2019t change the mistake underneath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a painting, Mom,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not your personal do-over experiment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen quit trying so hard to fix me before I\u2019m broken,\u201d she said, whisking tears off her cheeks. \u201cOkay, so you screwed up and you don\u2019t want me to, I get it, but I\u2019m not you. Let me figure things out for myself.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, trying to be so grown up, trying to process so much information at once.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really hard to do, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, give it a shot,\u201d she said, her old sarcasm seeping back in. As annoying as that was, it was a good sign. She sniffled and wiped under her eyes again. \u201cSo you were engaged at seventeen?\u201d</p><p>The memory of Noah replacing the string with his little ring he\u2019d worked so hard for sent a pang of regret through my core. We could have been a family. You had a family, Jules. Now I\u2019d pushed him away again so he could have one.</p><p>\u201cFor a little while,\u201d I said, forcing the words out. \u201cHe was going to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s like watching a movie, Mom,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I\u2019ve been in this family all along, the stupid one that didn\u2019t know anything. Do you know how crappy that feels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, inhaling deep and letting it go. I reached for her hand, and she inched it away. \u201cBecca, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s another choice I made, and maybe not the smartest. But it\u2019s not like knowing would have helped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was the guy?\u201d she asked, making my head spin with the direction change. \u201cWait.\u201d She turned to face me. \u201cLinny\u2019s brother just came back from somewhere. Mr. Ryan was making all that noise over\u2014\u201d</p><p>I nodded before she finished. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her wheels were turning again, and all I could do was hang on.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd that lady at the library\u2014you said it was his fianc\u00e9e\u2014oh, holy crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I said, rubbing my eyes.</p><p>Becca\u2019s gaze landed on the photos again, and she leaned over me to pick one up. One of Seth around thirteen years old, braces on his teeth. \u201cSo Nonnie had all this and didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A laugh that wasn\u2019t really a laugh but really just exhaustion making noise came out. \u201cThat\u2019s the question of the day.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the photo in her hand, and then at her profile. At the crazy hair framing her face, the eyes that had evidently cried the eyeliner off before she\u2019d ever gotten home. Still so innocent and young, no matter how many ways she tried not to be. I took a chance and swung an arm around her, pulling her head over to me.</p><p>\u201cThings happen as they\u2019re supposed to, baby girl,\u201d I said, kissing her hair. \u201cI thank God for giving me you.\u201d I heard a sniffle. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry about earlier.\u201d</p><p>I knew that slap would haunt me forever.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d came a squeaky response.</p><p>I didn\u2019t hold any na\u00efve opinions that all would be rosy, but just for one tiny moment, curled up on the couch with my girl in the middle of the night, I took a deeper breath than I had in a week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hayden looked as if he\u2019d aged ten years in a day, sitting in my kitchen, staring into his coffee like a whipped puppy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving it up, Jules,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean it this time.\u201d</p><p>I sat on a stool across the island from him, nursing a third cup of coffee, still in the black leggings and tank top from the previous day. I\u2019d added an old hole-ridden sweatshirt I\u2019d inherited from him when I was pregnant with Becca. It had seen better days, but it was a comfort thing, and if I was pathetic enough to keep on the clothes I\u2019d nearly made love to Noah in, then my ratty sweatshirt was right there in the running.</p><p>My head pounded from the crying marathon, my eyes were gritty and my throat was raw. Hayden\u2019s face had lit up with concern when I\u2019d opened the door, thinking I\u2019d fallen on my face when he\u2019d pushed me down at the bar. It\u2019s always encouraging to know just how bad you really look.</p> <p>I knew what he was there for, it wasn\u2019t the first time. Hayden was a binge drinker, not a constant one, but when he\u2019d decide to tie one on\u2014well, there wasn\u2019t an off switch. There\u2019d been many mornings such as this, full of apologies and promises and good intentions. And I\u2019d learned long before that time faded them. His good intentions would fall in a hole somewhere, and four or five months later we\u2019d be right back here. Sitting in a kitchen, drinking coffee, talking about how things would change.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter that much anymore, since he always stayed on the straight path around Becca, but old habits die hard.</p><p>\u201cI know, Hayden,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d My whole face itched with salt overload. \u201cWant a Pop-Tart or something?\u201d I slid off my stool and opened the fridge. \u201cI think I have a can of biscuits in here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>Harley jumped up from her full-body sprawl at my feet, her ears perking at the mention of Pop-Tarts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jules,\u201d he said, running a hand over his face and up through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m not here for you to feed me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s about all the brain power I have right now, so I\u2019d grab it if I were you,\u201d I said, opening the freezer to look for bacon. Found it. Closed the door. Not energetic enough to deal with oil.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t believe me,\u201d Hayden said, his words bouncing off my headache like they were playing Ping-Pong.</p><p>\u201cI always believe you,\u201d I said, finally finding the biscuits and deciding I wanted them. To hell with anyone else. I\u2019d eat all five. Maybe share one with Harley. Thank God it wasn\u2019t an eight-count can.</p><p>\u201cAnd I always let you down.\u201d</p><p>On that one, I turned. \u201cHayden, let it go. Please.\u201d</p><p>He met my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d I said, holding the cold biscuit can against my right temple. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me anymore. You want to quit? Quit. But it\u2019s for you, not for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019d actually got it together years ago?\u201d he said, sitting back in his chair. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be sitting in your mother\u2019s kitchen talking about how it\u2019s not about you.\u201d</p><p>I closed the fridge and walked-slash-shuffled over to him and leaned against the granite feeling really damn tired of hearing how many things my mother still owned. My kitchen, my house, my son.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my kitchen now,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd stop it. We are where we are because\u2014we just couldn\u2019t make it work.\u201d I pushed off and walked to the end table, scooping up a handful of pictures in one hand and coming back to spread them out in front of him.</p><p>Hayden\u2019s eyebrows came together as he leaned forward again, moving his coffee cup out of the way as he picked up and set down a photo or two.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what-ifs,\u201d I said, bringing his gaze to mine. My breath caught in my chest as I said the words. \u201cMy son.\u201d</p><p>His expression sharpened as he focused on me harder, looking at the photos more closely and then back at me in question.</p> <p>\u201cHoly shit, Jules. You have pictures now?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cMy mom did.\u201d</p><p>His wide-eyed expression slowly moved back into a knowing frown borne of experience. He\u2019d known my mother well. \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d</p><p>I gazed upon my little boy at various stages of his life. Stages it would have meant the world to me to be a witness to. \u201cArranged a trust for him\u2014not a bad thing\u2014but in exchange she got regular pictures and updates.\u201d I smiled, and my face felt as if it might crack. \u201cWhich she shared with Johnny Mack under another arrangement\u2014that I never be told.\u201d</p><p>Hayden closed his eyes and rubbed them.</p><p>\u201cHis name is S\u2014Seth,\u201d I said, still having trouble with knowing that. Feeling like somehow I should have just magically sensed it, and known he was a Seth, instead of being told my own son\u2019s identity.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he whispered, squeezing my hand.</p><p>\u201cI could play that damn what-if game for the rest of my life,\u201d I said. \u201cWith him, with you, with Becca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Noah Ryan,\u201d he added.</p><p>I faltered in my spiel, the sound of Noah\u2019s name putting his face right in front of me. The last expression I\u2019d seen on his face before I\u2019d told him good-bye yesterday. God, that was only yesterday.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live like that anymore, Hayden,\u201d I said, recovering. \u201cObsessing over how I\u2019d do things differently\u2014especially with Becca. All I can do is try to do it right, now.\u201d I touched his arm. \u201cYou, too.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at my hand and back at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Noah?\u201d he asked, his voice low.</p><p>God, if I could just cut that name out of everyone\u2019s vocabulary, my insides would have it so much easier. As it was, the quiver that started at my center and worked outward at every mention of his name, every memory of his face, every relived second of being wrapped up in him yesterday just mere feet from where I currently stood had me a jittery mess.</p><p>I let go of him and walked back around to my coffee, deciding I\u2019d had enough caffeine. \u201cNoah and Shayna are getting married, Hayden,\u201d I said, trying to pour the words down the drain with the cold coffee from my cup. \u201cThey have a baby on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask what\u2019s going on with them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m asking about Noah and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no Noah and me,\u201d I said, point-blank, turning back to him. \u201cNever can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour eyes say different,\u201d Hayden said, his voice soft, and maybe a little sad.</p><p>I widened them as much as I could. \u201cBullshit. My eyes aren\u2019t open enough to say anything,\u201d I said with a smirk, tossing a dishrag at his head.</p><p>He gestured toward the pictures spread in front of him. \u201cBecca know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, sighing heavily. \u201cShe does now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did that go?\u201d</p><p>The memory of me slapping her face as she called me a liar and a hypocrite seared through me. \u201cWe\u2019ve had better moments,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s kind of okay now.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause as Hayden stared at the pictures, though I had the impression that wasn\u2019t where he was at all.</p><p>\u201cJules, I remember the things I said\u2014about her, about you. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I said, laying my hands flat on the granite. \u201cSeriously, stop.\u201d</p><p>His eyes flashed. \u201cI threw you on the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t kick your ass for that,\u201d I said, trying desperately to lighten the tone. \u201cNow quit with the pity party and either pretend it never happened or make a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat never happened?\u201d Becca said on a yawn, shuffling into the kitchen in Mickey Mouse sleep pants and a Snoopy T-shirt, hair sticking up everywhere, looking like a ten-year-old with boobs.</p><p>\u201cNothing, monkey,\u201d he said, pulling the worry inside. He poked her in the side, making her flinch and grumble something incoherent.</p><p>She blinked sleepily at him, as if it just dawned on her that his being there drinking coffee in our kitchen was out of place.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Hayden shrugged. \u201cJust came to talk over some things with your mom.\u201d</p><p>She looked wary, cutting a look my way. \u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike not your business,\u201d he said with a wink.</p><p>I knew what she was thinking\u2014that I\u2019d told him about the whole birth control conversation. Truth be known, he probably was heading to that topic next if he could manage to get the hell off of Noah, but I would deflect that. Becca didn\u2019t need to know that I\u2019d told him. Nothing would have ever been the same between them.</p><p>I did a miniscule head shake to let her know that wasn\u2019t on the table, and her face relaxed. She picked up my forgotten biscuit can and her gaze fell on Seth\u2019s photos.</p><p>\u201cYou making biscuits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, turning on the oven.</p><p>Becca picked up a picture of Seth holding a puppy. \u201cHey, Dad, while you\u2019re here, can you help me make a giant snowflake?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Hayden blinked. \u201cAs in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in there\u2019s a big piece of plywood in the garage I can use, and your jigsaw is here, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy, do you have good timing,\u201d I said, smirking at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need a snowflake?\u201d he asked, his eyes going back and forth between us. \u201cOh, don\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping with a float for the parade,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d he said, giving me a look. \u201cI thought for a second there your mom had crossed over to the dark side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa.\u201d</p><p>Becca grinned and grabbed a mug from the cabinet. It was kind of normal again. Or at least a new version of it.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>It did my heart good to see Hayden and Becca work on something together and bicker over the details like they used to. Who would do the cutting and what exactly the design would be, and whether one side matched the other. I really didn\u2019t think anyone would be measuring as it rolled down the street, but they didn\u2019t want my input.</p><p>Two hours later Hayden emerged, dusted with sawdust. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t planning on staying this long so I have to go,\u201d Hayden said, fishing keys from his pocket. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be back later to help her finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. I knew, even with his complaining and groaning, that he secretly loved doing all of that with Becca. Kept him in the family, made him feel needed, and I didn\u2019t have to do it. Double score.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He turned to go and then turned back. \u201cLater, Bec!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye!\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d already flopped on the couch with a book.</p><p>\u201cYou do have some white paint and some glitter or something, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cUmm, doubtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d he said under his breath, taking the steps two at a time. He paused at the bottom and turned back around again. \u201cBe careful, Jules,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever happens with Ryan\u2014just, don\u2019t get hurt, okay?\u201d</p><p>Probably too late for that.</p><p>I lowered to sit on the steps after he left. It was nice out\u2014cold, but nice. Sunny, blue sky and rare, non-muggy air. Nice enough to leave the door open for a bit, and Harley took the bait. I heard her toenails on the wood as she slid into a prone position next to me.</p><p>\u201cHey, Harley-bear,\u201d I whispered, sliding my fingers into the soft fur at her neck. She instantly rolled to one side, probably figuring I was a sure thing for a belly rub.</p><p>I was pretty much a sure thing for anything not requiring thought. My brain, heart, and everything in between was fried. I would be strong and resilient and firm of resolve tomorrow. And every other day after that, as I watched Noah and Shayna embark on a life together with their new family, all up in my carefully crafted and protected world. I would be okay. I now had pictures of my son to help\u2014and hurt\u2014me. And a new reason to despise Noah\u2019s dad. I couldn\u2019t even think about my mother. My mind wouldn\u2019t let me go there yet, and that was okay, too. I probably didn\u2019t need to hate her, and right at that moment I couldn\u2019t make that promise.</p><p>Tomorrow. I\u2019d put my walls back up tomorrow. They\u2019d been with me for two decades, so one day of Noah yanking them down didn\u2019t scatter them too badly. I\u2019d rebuild. Be a hard-ass again and never let anyone close enough to threaten that. Ever again.</p><p>Tomorrow.</p><p>\u201cCan we go get some paint?\u201d Becca said, padding outside in socks, still in her sleep clothes. She crossed her feet and landed Indian style next to me, leaning over to bury her face in Harley\u2019s neck.</p><p>I ran two fingers under my eyes, not realizing I\u2019d teared up again. \u201cLater, okay?\u201d I said, the thought of going anywhere revitalizing my headache. \u201cOr I\u2019ll give you some money and you can go get something. Or you can see what your dad comes back with?\u201d</p><p>I saw her slump a little. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Mother of the year. I was mother of the freaking year.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to take a little walk down to Nana Mae\u2019s for a bit,\u201d I said. \u201cWant to come?\u201d</p><p>Becca shook her head and stretched. \u201cNo, thanks. That cat stalks me, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Maddy is a little unique, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth. \u201cIsn\u2019t Mr. Ryan\u2019s house on that same street?\u201d</p><p>I looked away, unwilling to cop to thinking the very same thing. \u201cNo, it\u2019s the one before. But I\u2019m going the long way.\u201d</p><p>After scooping up all the Seth pictures from the kitchen, I put them in a big envelope and slipped on some sneakers.</p><p>\u201cWanna go to Nana Mae\u2019s, Harley?\u201d I said, making her stop mid-step toward her doggie door and look at me. After a second\u2019s pause, she turned and went on through. She didn\u2019t like Maddy either.</p><p>It was faster to go down Johnny Mack\u2019s street, since Nana Mae was on the far corner of the next one, but I refused. I power-walked past it without even looking sideways, and then strolled up the next street to her house. She was outside crawling in her flower beds, in winter when there were no flowers, in bright orange yoga pants and a long-sleeved University of Texas T-shirt. Only my eighty-five-year-old Nana Mae.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, my sneakers sinking into her soft, plush lawn. Mine was never that good. My house, either. Then again, I didn\u2019t have three yard guys and a maid service on my payroll.</p><p>Nana Mae turned slowly from her crouching position in the dirt and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHey there, sweet pea!\u201d She backed out on all fours. \u201cHang on a second and I can look at you face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I planted this little cactus garden over there.\u201d She pointed with an elbow as I grabbed the other one to help her up. \u201cThen I saw a couple of weeds sprouting up, and, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s January, Nana Mae.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cactus, Julianna, it doesn\u2019t care,\u201d she said, grunting to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou pay people for this,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to crawl around on your knees anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like crawling around,\u201d she fussed. \u201cAnd if I wait on them, it all goes to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hopeless,\u201d I said, giving her shoulders a squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m breathing,\u201d she said, brushing off her pants and rubbing her hands together to knock some of the dirt loose. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she said, gesturing at the envelope in my hand.</p><p>I felt the smile leave my face and then tried to pull it back. I had pictures of him, finally. Something to show for the child I gave birth to, for the years of wondering. I should be happy. But all the crap surrounding them just felt life-sucking.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in so you can clean up,\u201d I said, holding up the envelope.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNothing you\u2019ve been busted for yet. Come on.\u201d</p><p>When she\u2019d washed up and settled onto the couch next to Maddy\u2014who glared at me for interfering once again\u2014I opened the envelope and laid everything out on the coffee table. Nana Mae frowned and pulled her readers from the top of her head, peering through them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked. \u201cCute little\u2014\u201d She stopped and gasped, looking up at me over the glasses. When I didn\u2019t say anything, she narrowed her gaze over them again, looking closer at one of them as she picked it up. One that looked very much like Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s the same boy, here as a man. Oh, honey, is this\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I said, clearing my throat of the lump that had risen there. \u201cI found out that his name is Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she exclaimed, her voice soft as she ran fingers over each of them, very much as I had. \u201cWhat a beautiful boy.\u201d She shook her head as her eyes filled with emotion. \u201cSo much like Becca when she was little. How did you get these?\u201d</p><p>I bit down on my lip. She was my mother\u2019s mother. But she looked up at me with true questions in her eyes and I couldn\u2019t lie to her.</p><p>\u201cMom had them hidden away,\u201d I said. \u201cIn a carved-out book.\u201d</p><p>I watched the words hit her with surprise, then make her sit back a fraction as she thought it through. Slowly, she shook her head, not wanting to believe what I might be saying, even before I\u2019d said much of anything.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than this,\u201d I said. \u201cLetters and drawings and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she said, the word barely making sound. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cEvidently she set up money for him in exchange for updates and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Nana Mae blinked rapidly. \u201cBut\u2014okay, but what about\u2014how did you find out about it?\u201d She stared down at all the captured moments of his life, held forever on photo paper and Polaroids. \u201cDid you just\u2014I mean, why was it hidden?\u201d</p><p>Her rapid-fire randomness was exactly how I felt.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t think I could handle it, so she decided\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she mumbled, putting a hand over her eyes.</p><p>I took a deep breath and continued. \u201cTo keep it under wraps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny Mack.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up and she shoved her glasses back up on top of her head. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah had pictures all along, sent from his dad, who got them from Mom.\u201d</p><p>She narrowed her eyes as if I\u2019d spoken Russian. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShayna told me that Noah had pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who is Shayna?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s\u2014fianc\u00e9e.\u201d I licked my lips and swallowed hard at the word.</p><p>Nana Mae sighed and sat back on the couch, studying me in that way of hers that always rattled me. \u201cOf course. And she\u2019s talking to you why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m her\u2014only friend here, I guess. I don\u2019t know. Anyway, she told me that and I went to ask him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ask Noah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And he said that his dad sent them, so we went to the diner\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you and him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! Will you quit?\u201d I said, getting flustered. \u201cAnd Johnny Mack told me the rest. Mom gave him copies and swore him to secrecy. So we went back to my house\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you and him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you really doing this right now?\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cAre you really getting all pinked up and bothered that I\u2019m pointing it out?\u201d</p><p>I felt the damning heat on my chest and neck. \u201cThis is about what Mom did,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019ll come back around to play. But first, I want to know why you\u2019re hanging out so much with the very people you need to avoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to hang out with anyone, Nana Mae,\u201d I said. \u201cI work next door, I live two blocks away, we do business in all the same places. What am I supposed to do\u2014leave town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweet pea, but he doesn\u2019t need to be coming over to your house, either,\u201d she said. \u201cYou do have a door.\u201d</p><p>I blew out a breath. \u201cI walked the long way today so I wouldn\u2019t pass the house.\u201d I sounded like a defensive teenager, but that\u2019s where I felt she was putting me.</p><p>\u201cGood girl,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, back to the pictures. You\u2014and Noah\u2014went to your house, found her stash, and had sex.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flew open wide. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d But I had to look away. Down at the pictures. Something to keep her from seeing everything else.</p><p>\u201cJesus, girl, don\u2019t you learn?\u201d she muttered, putting her glasses back on and peering down at the photos again.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fooled, and I felt the hopelessness of the night before pulling at me again.</p><p>\u201cI told him good-bye again,\u201d I said, my voice sounding as empty as I felt. \u201cHe has a second chance at getting a family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it is all about him,\u201d she said under her breath before glancing up at me over the rims. \u201cOh, crap, I know that weepy look.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my chin up. \u201cYou do not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI may be old but I still have my memory and this\u201d\u2014she wagged a finger up and down at me\u2014\u201cis you, twenty years ago over the same guy.\u201d</p><p>I stood up and reached for my pictures, Maddy raising her head to hiss at me over the quick movement.</p><p>\u201cOh, get over it,\u201d I hissed back.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Nana Mae asked.</p><p>\u201cHome,\u201d I said. \u201cI came to show you your great-grandson. Not get put on trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit back down,\u201d she said putting a hand on my arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Julianna.\u201d When I didn\u2019t move, she pointed at the chair. \u201cSit?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I sat and covered my face with my hands.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI was about to.\u201d I brought my hands down. \u201cI\u2019m pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sweet pea, you\u2019re in love,\u201d she said. \u201cGod help you. And that\u2019s something you haven\u2019t seen in a really long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Nana Mae,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t do this. He\u2019s taken. And I actually like the woman. She\u2019s so damn nice it irritates the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen steer clear,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause she\u2019ll pick up on the sparks, believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden tried to fight him the other night,\u201d I said, scooping my hair back. \u201cThink he picked up on a few too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord, I would\u2019ve paid to see that.\u201d She sat back again, taking a photo with her and sighing deeply. \u201cOh, Mary, what the hell did you do?\u201d she said, more to herself than to me.</p><p>I was quiet, letting her go where she wanted with her thoughts. I knew how it felt to want to shake your daughter senseless. Feeling that after their death must be heart wrenching. Parents should never outlive their children.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell you either,\u201d I said, finally.</p><p>Nana Mae shook her head and dabbed at her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sure she knew I\u2019d disapprove. That I\u2019d tell you.\u201d She put the picture down, her face twitching with sadness and anger. \u201cSome things about your mother I swear I never came to understand and probably never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMe too, sweet pea.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sat in my car on the other side of the building, hiding again like a big fat coward. I\u2019d made it through an entire day post-almost-sex-with-Noah, but that wasn\u2019t saying much considering I\u2019d never left my house or my make-out clothes.</p><p>It was Monday. A new day, a new week. Showering today had stripped my armor and my courage, and so while I\u2019d come in early to hopefully avoid him, and checked out the front to make sure his truck wasn\u2019t there yet, I still felt the need to sit there and recharge.</p><p>\u201cGrow up, Julianna,\u201d I said, blowing out a breath.</p><p>I got out and smoothed down the dark green sweater dress I\u2019d worn\u2014just in case paths might cross after all. Because in all my determination to avoid him, I was supremely twisted in my need to look hot. For my ex-boyfriend that I\u2019d turned away while still needing him to see what he was missing.</p> <p>Women are messed up.</p><p>And as I rounded the corner of the sidewalk I nearly sucked my tongue down my throat as Noah and Shayna got out of his truck, parked right in front of my damn door.</p><p>\u201cShit\u2014son of a bitch,\u201d I muttered, fighting the urge to turn around and run back to my car. But we were only twenty feet apart, and the heeled boots I\u2019d just had to wear gave me away.</p><p>They both turned. Shayna with a smile and concern and already moving in my direction. Noah, looking like he\u2019d just been hit with a stun gun. He stopped where he stood, his eyes glazing over. That was his way, and how it would be for us going forward. Protection by way of shutting down. Boy, the next twenty years were going to be a real riot.</p><p>Damn it, if I\u2019d just not been such a wuss and gotten out of the freaking car when I got there.</p> <p>Look away. Look away. Don\u2019t make eye contact.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Shayna said, reaching me as I got to my door. She grabbed my hand in her gloved one. \u201cI heard about everything, Jules, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Everything? I sincerely doubted that. She wouldn\u2019t have been holding my hand if she had. She\u2019d be breaking my fingers.</p><p>\u201cThank you, it\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s all okay now.\u201d Which was a lie. Nothing was okay. Things might very well never be okay again.</p><p>Shayna reached back for Noah and pulled him from where he\u2019d taken root in the concrete. I saw him shove his hands into his leather jacket pockets.</p><p>\u201cNoah said you were really upset, Jules, I\u2019m so sorry I told you like that. I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I was already shaking my head. \u201cNo, no, not at all, Shayna, you didn\u2019t do anything. And thanks to you I have pictures now.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cIt was a rough day, yes. But something very precious came out of it.\u201d I pressed a hand against my stomach and held my chin up. \u201cIt\u2019s a day I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>I heard a sharp exhale come from him, and he coughed to cover it. \u201cI\u2019m going in, Shayna,\u201d he said, his voice sounding tired. Like maybe he didn\u2019t sleep either. \u201cGlad you\u2019re feeling better, Jules.\u201d</p><p>At my name, my gaze shot up to meet his. In that one second, he faltered. I saw the rawness of our connection before the walls came back and locked into place. I blinked and jerked my eyes away.</p><p>And saw Shayna staring at him, her eyebrows slightly pulled together like she was studying a painting.</p><p>\u201cY\u2019all have a good day,\u201d I said quickly, turning to unlock my door before anyone could study anyone. \u201cShit,\u201d I whispered under my breath as I pulled the door open and slipped inside.</p><p>The quiet darkness enveloped me, and I let it. I walked farther into the dark of the store, away from the invasive light of the windows, and sank into a soft chair. I\u2019d forgotten how much I loved that\u2014getting there before Ruthie and just soaking up the quiet. I\u2019d let her open up for\u2014I didn\u2019t even know how long it had been. It was never an official decision, it just sort of became the norm.</p><p>I felt it, the heaviness of the days. The strength of will I was going to have to muster. I should have never let myself go there with Noah. God, what was I thinking? There was no ignoring him now. Just seeing him on the sidewalk had made my knees weak. How the hell was I supposed to go about daily life?</p><p>The door jingled, making me sit up.</p> <p>\u201cJules?\u201d Ruthie\u2019s voice called out. She sounded wary and a little concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said, swiping under my eyes as lights started powering up. I hadn\u2019t even realized I\u2019d teared up, but hell, of course I had. That\u2019s all I did anymore.</p><p>I knew I had some hell to pay with her, too. I\u2019d left to bring books to the library on Saturday and never came back, never checked on her chair, leaving her with cryptic texts that I was okay but out till Monday. She was going to string me up. And not for taking a day off.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here early,\u201d she said, rounding a bookshelf to find me. \u201cAnd what the hell is up?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOh\u2014so much to tell you, so few days left in the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSummarize,\u201d she said, a hand on one hip.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was the Antichrist, she hid photos of my son right under my nose, gave them to Johnny Mack in a secret alliance, his name is Seth, Becca knows about him now, Shayna and Noah are only together because she\u2019s pregnant, and I nearly slept with him.\u201d</p><p>I saw her eyebrows raise. \u201cHoly fuck. All that in two days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d I said, rubbing my temples. \u201cYesterday was a recovery day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, how do you nearly sleep\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words were cut off by the door jingling again, and we both leaned over to tell whoever it was that we weren\u2019t open yet. But it wasn\u2019t a customer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Shayna said, rapping her knuckles on the open door for additional warning.</p><p>I was on my feet in an instant. \u201cNo problem, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014need to come over there,\u201d she said, pointing at the wall between the diner and me. Her face was as white as a sheet, and her eyes looked glassy, even though she smiled. \u201cTo the diner. You need to come with me.\u201d</p><p>I frowned and little alarm bells went off in my head. Was it a showdown? Did she know? Or was it something else? Something about her expression was very, very off.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked, already walking forward.</p><p>\u201cJust\u2014\u201d She turned and held open the door.</p><p>\u201cShayna, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d I said, cold fear creeping up my legs.</p><p>Ruthie linked an arm with mine and walked out with me, probably getting the same sense of not-right. We followed Shayna, watching her take a deep breath as she pulled open the diner door for us.</p><p>Ruthie held my arm tighter as we entered, ever the protective one. But I searched Shayna\u2019s face as we passed her. Looking for signs of what we were walking into so I could layer up more walls. I steeled myself for Noah, knowing at the very least he\u2019d be part of the equation, but I didn\u2019t see him right away. Customers were milling, but that was it. Not even Johnny Mack or Linny was in sight. I frowned and looked back at Shayna.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIn the back?\u201d I echoed, my feet halting of their own volition. I hadn\u2019t been behind the kitchen since before Noah left town. \u201cI don\u2019t go in the back, Shayna.\u201d</p><p>Undeterred, she walked past me and grabbed my hand, dragging me behind her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Ruthie muttered, balking, but I tightened my grip on her. Wherever I was going, she was coming too.</p><p>Shayna pulled us through the kitchen to a back hallway, where I knew a break room similar to mine existed. Next to the office. She pushed open a door that wasn\u2019t completely closed, and I heard voices. Laughing voices, and Linny sniffling. Johnny Mack\u2019s wheezy guffaw.</p><p>When we entered, all heads turned to us. Linny\u2019s eyes were red, as were Noah\u2019s, but the glazed-over look was gone. He was nothing but exposed emotion. He looked like me a couple of nights prior.</p><p>Johnny Mack\u2019s expression changed slightly, from gleeful to cautious.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d he asked. Not as mean as before, I noticed. Just a question.</p><p>Noah shook his head. \u201cNo\u2014Jules should be\u2014\u201d He looked at Shayna with immense gratitude. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her eyes watered, and my stomach knotted at the clear intimacy between them. I didn\u2019t want to see that. I didn\u2019t want to be around him or them or any of this.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d I said, letting go of Ruthie and crossing my arms over myself. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d</p><p>Just then, the door from the bathroom opened, and another younger man stepped out. All eyes went from us to him, and he looked around a little nervously under the weight of the attention. He had a polite smile, if slightly standoffish. His dark hair was cropped short, his eyes were dark blue, and when they landed on me my heart slammed against my ribs.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>I\u2019d know him anywhere. Even though I\u2019d only seen him in pictures the day before yesterday, and in person when he was only minutes old.</p><p>Noah\u2019s hand was on my back, pulling me with him.</p><p>\u201cJules, meet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d I finished with him, the sound barely registering in the room.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The cry came at the end of my own, and it was like something out of a movie. My wail of pain and release that melded with the angry scream of something pulled from comfort into bright light and cold.</p><p>It was beautiful. It was horrible. It was over.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy.\u201d</p><p>The doctor\u2019s voice was remote, as if he already knew this wasn\u2019t your normal happy delivery. There were no congratulations. Through a haze of pain I started to panic. To second-guess. What had I done?</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014\u201d I breathed, but no one heard me in the ruckus.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d Noah yelled, fist-pumping the air. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>He was crying and laughing at the same time, kissing me, standing up to stare in awe at the creation I hadn\u2019t seen yet, and then kissing me again.</p><p>\u201cA boy,\u201d I echoed, my voice scratchy and raw from the screaming. I tried to sit up or move to see him but my body wouldn\u2019t work. Damn epidural. I felt the burn of tears at the back of my throat as the frustration began to seep through my skin.</p><p>\u201cYou did it, baby,\u201d Noah said, over and over. \u201cYou did it.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cNearly broke my damn hand but you did it. He\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2014\u201d My voice broke and I squeezed his hand as hard as I could to get his attention. My baby\u2019s cries were ripping at my insides. \u201cNoah, I need to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will, Mommy,\u201d he said, his blue eyes dancing with so much love it broke my heart. He moved the sweaty hair from where it stuck to my forehead. \u201cBe patient, they\u2019re doing their thing.\u201d He kept looking over to the table. \u201cGod, he\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re cleaning him up,\u201d said a nurse to my right.</p><p>I reached for her with my other hand and gripped her arm as if it were the only thing holding my sanity together. \u201cPlease,\u201d I said, begging her with my eyes. \u201cPlease.\u201d My voice cracked and fresh hot tears burned tracks down my cheeks.</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes went soft. Compassionate. Oh, God, she was going to help me. She patted my hand and placed it back on the rail as she nodded. I watched her face as Noah rambled in my ear about names and baseball and bicycles, lifting my head with great effort to watch her speak to the other nurse and doctor tending to my little boy.</p><p>Impatience lined the doctor\u2019s face around the mask as he turned back to look at me, but my angel nurse put a hand on his arm and said something else. Whatever it was made his expression relax, and my heart jumped as he nodded.</p><p>Noah\u2019s voice brought me back to him as he wiped my tears. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, love, the hard part is over. We\u2019ve got this.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve got this. I met his eyes. They were so happy. So intent on making this happen. On being a family. \u201cNoah\u2014I\u2019m\u2014\u201d I couldn\u2019t finish. My hot tears built to sobs that shook me from head to toe, and I had to look away from him.</p><p>\u201cJules, what\u2019s wrong\u2014look, here he comes!\u201d</p><p>The angel nurse appeared at my right, holding a bundle of screaming redness wrapped in a blue blanket. Her badge said her name was Courtney. And Courtney had tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have to hold him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you can look.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d always thought newborn photos were hideous. They always looked like little alien creatures, and I never understood why anyone ever thought those babies were attractive.</p><p>Mine was beautiful. He had a head full of dark hair and his face was all scrunched up, mouth trembling, bare little gums gleaming in the light. He was the most gorgeous alien I\u2019d ever seen. I was in love. I lifted a hand and ran my fingers tentatively along his cheek, on skin so velvety I almost couldn\u2019t feel it. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d I whispered. \u201cMy baby.\u201d</p><p>I was in love with my little boy. And my heart stuttered in my chest.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d I gasped. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>Noah didn\u2019t hear me. He was crying and kissing my hand. \u201cI love you, Jules,\u201d he said, his voice shaking. \u201cI love our new family. God, he\u2019s so\u2014\u201d</p><p>My mother\u2019s voice resonated outside the door, breaking through my baby\u2019s cries. The door opened then, and she was there, loose untied scrubs hanging on her and a mask held to her face.</p><p>Oh, God, I\u2019d forgotten about my mother. Evidently someone had called her. By the look on Noah\u2019s face, it certainly wasn\u2019t him. And the look on her face as her eyes landed on the baby made my skin go cold.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, instinctively wanting to shield him. From her, from me, from all that was about to go down. He wasn\u2019t going to know me. Oh, my God, he would never know me. What the hell did I do?</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she said, looking at Courtney. \u201cI had instructions not to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, no!\u201d I croaked. \u201cI need to see him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her hold him,\u201d Noah said then, his tone different. Wary. Protective.</p><p>Courtney looked from Noah to my mother, but not back to me. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to even do this,\u201d my mother said, rounding the end of the bed. \u201cIt\u2019s cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Courtney said, backing up with the baby. \u201cShe just wanted to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet. Her. Hold him,\u201d Noah repeated, his voice strong in the room. \u201cShe\u2019s his mother. I\u2019m his father. Let me hold him.\u201d I tore my eyes away from my son to focus on Noah\u2019s face. His eyes were narrowed on my mother. \u201cYou weren\u2019t invited in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t your business,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is our family.\u201d He turned back to Courtney, who was slowly walking back to the doctor and nurse, cooing at our crying infant. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we hold him?\u201d Noah stepped in front of her, holding out his arms to take him.</p><p>\u201cBecause he isn\u2019t yours,\u201d my mother said.</p><p>Noah started as if he\u2019d been slapped. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried. \u201cMom, look at him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s not mine?\u201d Noah said, his voice clipped.</p><p>Mom ignored him, looking away from his glare. \u201cJulianna\u2014that doesn\u2019t help anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at him!\u201d I screamed.</p><p>Reluctantly, she blinked rapidly and turned to peer upon my son. Her grandson. Her family. Slowly, the hand that held the mask to her face lowered, and I saw the quivering in her mouth. I saw her eyes fill. I saw it. There was hope. She\u2019d fix it. She\u2019d tear up the\u2014</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said, her voice uncharacteristically unsteady. Slowly, she turned back to me and whisked tears off her cheeks before they could render her weak. \u201cHe\u2019s a beautiful boy, sweetheart. You gave him life. Now it\u2019s time to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it is!\u201d Noah said, spurred into motion. \u201cThat\u2019s our son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I cried again as the other nurse opened the door and Courtney walked through it. She looked over her shoulder before she disappeared, compassion filling her eyes. \u201cNo, wait!\u201d I couldn\u2019t catch my breath, it was coming in gasps.</p><p>Noah surged toward the door and the doctor blocked him, holding him in a full body hold as Noah turned into a charging bull.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take my son!\u201d he screamed, his voice hoarse and tinged with panic. \u201cWhat the hell are you people doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind\u2014Mom, I changed my mind. Go fix this. Tear it up. Tell them it\u2019s off, we\u2019re gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanged your mind?\u201d Noah said, spinning around as if he\u2019d been shot. \u201cChanged your mind about what? Tear up what?\u201d He was shaking his head in disbelief, and my mouth couldn\u2019t form the words. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign anything,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not of age,\u201d Mom said.</p><p>He stared at her for a long moment before dragging tortured eyes back to me. \u201cWe talked about this, Jules. We\u2014we\u2014settled this.\u201d The shock and realization and horror settled into his face, looking exactly like I felt. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everything I ever thought I would say left me. All the words. All the justifications. He would never know me. And he didn\u2019t. The last time I\u2019d seen him he hadn\u2019t seen me\u2014his eyes weren\u2019t even open yet. Now a man stood before me.</p><p>My son smiled nervously down into my face, as he would any other stranger he just met.</p><p>I did that.</p><p>Noah was somewhere behind me, I could feel him. His presence was powerful back there, like he was waiting to catch me again. Ever available to be my rescuer. But the face I\u2019d seen when I walked in didn\u2019t look powerful. He looked like I imagined I did.</p> <p>I wanted to hug this beautiful man-child in front of me, but I found myself stuck. Did I have that right? Was he a hugger? Would he stiffen and recoil if I did?</p><p>Instead, I stood there awkwardly, trying to stem the new tears that insisted on pushing forward, and I reached out with one hand. Touched his arm. He was real and solid and something about that released everything.</p><p>Fat tears rolled down my face as I laughed and cried at the same time. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you again,\u201d I managed to say.</p><p>Seth smiled and took my hand in both of his. \u201cIt\u2019s good to finally meet you.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Well, there was that.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you\u2014how are you here?\u201d I asked, hoping he wouldn\u2019t let go. I was holding my son\u2019s hand, and every possible nerve in my body was aware of it. Holding his hand for the first time.</p><p>Seth turned to Johnny Mack and smiled again before looking back at me. \u201cMr. Ryan looked me up.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Johnny Mack, who met my eyes for just that one second before blinking away. He looked him up. I have real grandchildren to get to know. My blood. Ah. Got it. How cute.</p><p>He looked him up for himself, or probably as a gift for Noah. Had Noah and I not reconnected, if Shayna were the protective jealous shrew she should be instead of being so damn nice to me, would I even be standing there?</p><p>Yes. Because Noah would have done the right thing.</p><p>\u201cIn all honesty,\u201d Seth continued, \u201cThe timing really worked out because I signed up on an online list last year.\u201d He gave a boyish shrug that tugged at my mommy heart. \u201cI figured it\u2019d be nice to know where I came from. In case there was anybody with eleven toes or insanity that hits at thirty or something.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone laughed. And it felt wonderful. I swiped tears off my cheeks and let myself laugh, watching my amazing boy stand there with everyone staring at him like he was under a microscope and still talk with ease and make a room full of strangers laugh with no problem.</p><p>\u201cWell, no extra limbs that I know of,\u201d Linny said, sniffling loudly. \u201cBut the old man has serious sanity issues.\u201d</p><p>Johnny Mack reddened and tried to look good-natured in spite of the fact that nothing in him could ever be that. Seth chuckled and continued to stand there as I realized we needed to do something besides stare at him in the little room.</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d I began, profoundly. \u201cDo you want to go sit down? Go next door to the bookstore\u2014it\u2019s mine, we can do that,\u201d I rambled. \u201cOr forget the store, I\u2019ll close it for the day. We can go to my house and\u2014\u201d Wait. No.</p><p>\u201cI think staying here in the diner is fine,\u201d Johnny Mack piped in.</p><p>\u201cAnd what, cram everyone in a booth?\u201d Linny said, fixing him with a look. \u201cLet them go, he\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Seth looked amused at the tug-of-war over him. \u201cHey, I\u2019m just grateful to be here. To meet everyone.\u201d He held his palms out. \u201cI\u2019m here today and tomorrow, so there\u2019s no rush.\u201d He looked at me and then to Noah, as if we were the deciding votes. Which I guess we were. \u201cWhatever you want to do. Wherever you want to go. It\u2019s probably gonna be weird anywhere so don\u2019t stress.\u201d</p><p>Damn good thing he was the grown-up in the situation, because I felt like neither of us were.</p> <p>\u201cNoah, Jules has the right idea. Why don\u2019t the three of you go over to her house so you can just be comfortable and relax,\u201d Shayna said, her hands on his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said reassuringly as he looked down at her in surprise.</p><p>But I knew what that look was, as the same sense of oh shit permeated my brain. Why had I suggested that? Going back to my house? With Noah. In my living room. Where we almost did the deed just two days ago. No, we needed Shayna there, because that made it infinitely better. Always better that the pregnant fianc\u00e9e come along\u2014the one whose phone call stopped us from the primal monkey sex on the rug.</p><p>\u201cOr we could go back to your dad\u2019s house,\u201d I said quickly, meeting his eyes and pretending he was someone else so Shayna wouldn\u2019t see it. My stealth skills were toast. \u201cIf that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Noah nodded, looking spent. \u201cProbably so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then I can just go\u2014\u201d Shayna began, looking uncertain.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go anywhere,\u201d I said. \u201cYou stay with us.\u201d</p><p>Her face relaxed and she smiled a thank-you to me that didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. Nothing had. That was something I\u2019d learned about her in the short time I\u2019d known her. She wore her worry there. And something was chewing on her. Was it me? Did she know? Surely not. Or maybe she was beginning to suspect since Noah and I were wearing our crazy like neon signs. Then again, maybe that was my own paranoid guilt waving at me, and she just had a lot on her plate. Like being unsure about marrying Noah.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I said, leading the way, needing to move and needing to stop looking at him even more.</p><p>Ruthie dabbed under her eyes and stopped me to throw her arms around my neck. I felt the weakness come into my bones, as everything in me just wanted to drop to the floor and sit cross-legged across from her and unload all my woes like we did when we were girls. But there was no time for that now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the store,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>On the sidewalk, I turned back to Seth, struck once again with the Noah resemblance. \u201cDo you\u2014have a car? Want to ride with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my truck over here,\u201d he said, probably grateful for the breathing space for the fifteen seconds it was going to take to get to the house. \u201cI\u2019ll follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, turning down the sidewalk and then spinning around with a hand up. \u201cI don\u2019t mean good, like good, I just meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it,\u201d Seth said, laughing and getting into his truck with a wink.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I mumbled, smiling, as I turned around and walked toward my car on legs I couldn\u2019t feel. I passed Shayna and Noah getting in his truck and refused to look that way. I was going to his friggin\u2019 house, I\u2019d see plenty of them there.</p><p>I shut my car door and plugged my keys in, watching my hands tremble. I gripped the steering wheel and squeezed my eyes shut. My breaths got choppy and I knew what was coming. I pressed my hand against my mouth to push it back.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d I whispered, sucking in sharp breaths against the burn. \u201cI just met my son.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Seth cased the place very much like Noah had when he\u2019d come to my house that first morning, hands in his jacket pockets and eyes soaking in every detail. He of course went to the photographs first, and I wondered what that felt like. Looking at photos of a family that you should have been part of but weren\u2019t. His photos were in another house, with another family.</p><p>Noah explained each and every one, named grandparents and cousins and told funny stories that had been captured of him and Linny. Shayna and I sat on two separate couches and listened as Noah danced around every one but the prom picture of us. Until he did. Or Seth did, actually.</p><p>He picked it up and turned to me with a smirk that made the skin on my back tingle. He looked so much like his dad in that moment it was surreal.</p><p>\u201cNice hair,\u201d he said, holding it up.</p><p>Noah laughed and I scrunched my nose. \u201cIt was the eighties, baby, what can I say?\u201d I held a hand out for it. \u201cLet me look at that.\u201d</p><p>Seth walked it over to me and sat on the arm of the couch like it was entirely normal for us to look at something together. I stared up at him for as long as I dared before he could catch me and it would get awkward. Then I blinked my vision free and focused on the dusty framed picture that was starting to show some age.</p><p>A skinny Noah with a hideous tux and a head full of shaggy dark hair smiled back at me, his arms wrapped tightly around a dark-haired girl with a secretive smile. She held flowers in front of where I knew Noah\u2019s hands rested protectively. I knew what that smile was about. We\u2019d just found out about the baby and hadn\u2019t told anyone yet. It was still our little secret. Before the rest of the world had a chance to weigh in. God, we looked so young, and in love.</p><p>\u201cYou were there,\u201d I said softly, my voice barely more than a whisper. I pointed to the flowers. \u201cRight there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pregnant then?\u201d Seth asked, his voice warm over me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d just found out,\u201d Noah said, walking closer but still keeping a safe distance. \u201cNo one knew yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was still just ours, then,\u201d I said, not looking away from the picture. From the moment in time\u2014probably the only one caught on film\u2014when we were happy and in love and full of romantic ideas of what having a baby would be. \u201cBefore parents found out.\u201d I pointed to Noah\u2019s huge grin. \u201cSee? How happy he was? My dad hadn\u2019t threatened to castrate him, yet.\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed, a hearty sound that made me look up in spite of myself. An invisible hand squeezed my heart as our eyes met, but I didn\u2019t look away this time. Memorize this moment, Jules. For this one tiny microsecond, the three of us are together again. He saw it, too. As his gaze flickered between Seth and me, the rawness came to the surface. My own eyes filled, and I finally had to look down and blink it away.</p><p>\u201cWas this your senior year?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cJunior.\u201d I cleared my throat of the huskiness. \u201cWe weren\u2019t together for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left town,\u201d Noah said. \u201cAfter\u2014after you were born.\u201d He sat on an ottoman across from us, and I glanced over at Shayna. She looked like an island over there by herself. \u201cI went to stay with my uncle in San Antonio and finished school there. Signed up for the Navy, and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father sent you away?\u201d Seth asked, a frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was my idea,\u201d Noah said, looking down at his hands. \u201cI had to get away. I couldn\u2019t be here. Couldn\u2019t just\u2014go back to school like nothing ever happened.\u201d He sat up taller and inhaled slowly. \u201cNever planned on returning, but life changes things sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you come back?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cLast week.\u201d</p><p>Seth laughed. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d I echoed as Noah looked at me so intently that I couldn\u2019t look away or blink or anything. My fingertips went numb.</p><p>Noah looked down at his hands again, releasing me from that damn freeze-glare of his, the haunted memories still sitting on him as he mentally replayed everything. I felt Seth\u2019s gaze on me, and my skin felt like it was a thousand degrees as he put a hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid you leave, too?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, unable to look away from Noah\u2019s face. \u201cMy parents let me stay home sick for three days and then\u2014\u201d My words stuck in my throat. And then what? What was I supposed to say?</p><p>That I stopped caring or eating or talking to anyone? That I lived on angry music and alcohol and whatever drug I could find at the moment? That I pushed away everyone and everything that resembled what normal used to be? Anything that required feeling. My friends, my art, books, life. Until Ruthie reached down deep and yanked me out of my own self-imposed hell. And then there was Hayden.</p><p>\u201c\u2014I managed to graduate, let\u2019s just leave it at that,\u201d I said, handing the picture back to Noah.</p><p>Seth was studying me, however. Damn it, he had that Noah thing.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your idea to give me up, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, the word coming out on a heavy breath.</p><p>Noah got up and put the picture back in its place on the table, and Shayna rose to stand next to him. The picture of love and solidarity.</p><p>\u201cMy\u2014my parents made all that happen,\u201d I said. \u201cMy mother, mostly. She\u2014thought it was the best thing for me.\u201d Oh, that was a nice way to put it.</p><p>\u201cShe was a coldhearted micromanaging shrew that arranged a deal with your adopted parents to get photos of you,\u201d Noah said, his voice even. \u201cThat she then kept hidden in a box and took that secret to her grave. Jules didn\u2019t see them until day before yesterday.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped open and Seth\u2019s eyebrows lifted.</p><p>\u201cWell, okay then,\u201d I said softly. \u201cNow you know the true guts of it.\u201d I touched his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Seth.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed it back and got up to take Noah\u2019s place on the ottoman, facing me. \u201cDon\u2019t be,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, yes, be sorry for what you\u2019ve given up, I understand that. But don\u2019t be sorry for me.\u201d Seth smiled, a little apologetically, and it reminded me of Becca when she was in trouble. \u201cI had good parents. A good childhood. You gave me to great people who loved me.\u201d</p><p>My chest burned hearing those words. I loved you, too. Every day. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to know that,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI can tell they did a fantastic job with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they were always honest with me. With me and my little brother. They adopted Shon three years after me. They told us even when we were little that we came from other mommies\u2019 tummies,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cAnd you showed me a picture of that.\u201d</p><p>Before I could stop myself, I reached out and touched his cheek, rough in one spot where a razor missed and very different from the velvetiness of the last time I\u2019d done that. To his credit, he didn\u2019t flinch or pull away.</p><p>\u201cSo tell us about you,\u201d I said, needing to lighten the heaviness of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m boring,\u201d he said on a chuckle, relieving some of the tension. \u201cSeriously.\u201d He pointed at me and Noah simultaneously. \u201cBusiness owner with a crazy mom\u2014no offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d I said with a laugh and little head bow. I had to laugh. What else could I do?</p><p>\u201c\u2014and a Navy SEAL?\u201d he continued. \u201cMy life is very sedate compared to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know all that?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cMr. Ryan told me,\u201d Seth said. \u201cWell\u2014you added the crazy mother part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to fill in the blanks,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you do, Seth?\u201d Shayna asked, speaking for what I realized was the first time since we\u2019d arrived. She still wore that look of hers. The one that made her appear not totally in the room with us.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a police officer,\u201d he said. \u201cJust made detective, actually,\u201d he added with a smile that lit up his face. \u201cYoungest in my precinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSedate?\u201d I reached over and patted his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think so! That\u2019s amazing, Seth, congratulations!\u201d</p><p>Noah crossed the room, beaming, holding out a hand as Seth got up on instinct. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome,\u201d Noah said, gripping Seth\u2019s hand in that manly thing guys do. \u201cYou should be so proud. Your parents\u2014\u201d He faltered, and I saw the struggle in his eyes. \u201cThey must be over the moon.\u201d</p><p>Seth smiled and glanced back at me as if to gauge his words. I forced any sadness from my face\u2014he didn\u2019t need that burden. I wanted him to feel free to say anything and not feel awkward.</p><p>\u201cThey are,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom threw a big block party and forced all her neighbors to bring food. Even got her pastor to come over and bless me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cSounds like something my Nana Mae would do\u2014Nana Mae!\u201d I sucked in a breath and looked at Noah as if he could possibly understand me. \u201cOh, my grandmother has to meet you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother is still alive?\u201d Seth asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m not that ancient, thank you,\u201d I said with a wink when he reddened. \u201cAnd Nana Mae is eternal. She will love you.\u201d My breath caught in my throat. \u201cAnd Becca, my daughter.\u201d</p><p>It was my turn to look at him with apology in my eyes. How do you look into the eyes of a child you gave away and tell him you kept the next one? He blinked a few times, and I would have given anything to be in his head, viewing those thoughts. Or then again, maybe not.</p><p>\u201cI was going to ask if you had any other kids\u2014if I had any siblings,\u201d he said finally. \u201cWasn\u2019t sure how to bring that up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bring up anything you want,\u201d I said. \u201cComing here like this\u2014that\u2019s a pretty brave thing, baby. Even for a grown, big badass police detective.\u201d Seth laughed and I focused on the smile in his eyes instead of Noah\u2019s right behind him. Seth\u2019s were safer. \u201cThere are no taboo questions. Nothing off-limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said.</p><p>I took a deep breath and stood up so we were all on the same level. \u201cYou have a sister\u2014a half sister. She\u2019s seventeen going on thirty, and her name is Becca.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEveryone should be tortured with teenagers at some point,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cOh, I get that,\u201d Seth said. \u201cI see more than I want of teenage drama in my job. Or I did as a beat cop, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Seth glanced to Noah, and I saw the hollowness enter Noah\u2019s eyes as he tried to fill it with Shayna. He put an arm around her and pulled her to him. \u201cI never had any other kids,\u201d he said. His eyes met mine instead of Seth\u2019s. \u201cBut Shayna and I have one on the way now.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard as Seth congratulated them and hugged Shayna. That was my life now. How it was going to be for a friggin\u2019 eternity. I almost wished Patrick was back next to me so I could introduce him as my boy-toy and get the edge back.</p><p>Wow, that was mature.</p><p>\u201cSo, who do I meet next?\u201d Seth asked, bringing me back. \u201cOr what is next?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThis is your show. What do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said with a boyish grin that made him look much less grown up. He held his hands out wide. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m winging this. And that is so far outside my box, you have no idea.\u201d</p><p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cA planner, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the core.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and moved before I could think about it. \u201cYou come by that honestly,\u201d I said as I hugged him.</p><p>His hesitance made me freeze and pull away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>Maybe he wasn\u2019t a hugger. Maybe he wasn\u2019t a demonstrative person. Maybe he wasn\u2019t that comfortable with meeting his parents yet\u2014No. I had to stop that train, cold. We weren\u2019t his parents. We gave him life, but his parents raised him.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, looking troubled. Or maybe embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m just still nervous, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally understandable,\u201d I said, wanting to stick my head in a freezer to chill the heat coming off my face.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go grab some lunch at the diner,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>I knew he was trying to diffuse the sudden awkward turn of conversation and help me out, but he was suddenly standing too close for my heat-infused brain to handle gracefully.</p><p>\u201cLunch is good,\u201d I said, backing away from him a step and knocking into the coffee table. Loudly.</p><p>Noah grabbed my elbow to steady me and ended up pulling me closer in the move. I bit down on my lip as I looked up into blue eyes that darkened with memory and cursed my body\u2019s automatic reaction to him.</p><p>Not. Mine. To. Want.</p><p>That needed to be filed away under stupid things never to do again. Regardless of all the things his face was telling me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I said, smiling to prove it. \u201cJust clumsy. Let\u2019s go.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lunch was a blur. I couldn\u2019t tell you what was said, other than Seth\u2019s favorite food was french fries. I don\u2019t think I even dogged that. Ruthie would have been proud.</p><p>Words were like background noise, humming along to my thoughts and my chewing. To the visuals as I stared at the two men across the table. Linny got us a booth by the bar so she could frequent it, and Noah and Seth sat across from me and Shayna.</p><p>It was brutal. And all I could do was shovel food in so I\u2019d have something to do with my hands. Not only was it surreal to see my son across from me, grown up and talking about the world with my mouth and Noah\u2019s hair and eyes and everything else, but just seeing the two of them sitting together\u2014it killed me. They were so alike. Not just in looks but even mannerisms and personalities. Already joking like best buddies that had hung out for years. I\u2019d taken that away from both of them.</p><p>Even though I knew now that Seth had a happy life and probably brought incredible joy to the family that loved him, I felt a severe hit to the gut that we missed it. That Noah never got to teach him to throw a ball or swim or ride a bike, like Hayden had with Becca.</p> <p>And then there was the constant work of avoiding Noah\u2019s eyes. It seemed that every time I looked his way, he\u2019d be looking at me, and we\u2019d stick like that for a few seconds, turning my insides to a shimmying mess. I\u2019d shove more food I couldn\u2019t taste into my mouth and stare at my plate like it was food from the gods until Shayna would occasionally pipe in with something, and then I\u2019d catch Noah smiling at her and want to throw it all back up. It was the longest meal of my life.</p><p>\u201cSo, if you want to go back to your house for a while,\u201d Noah was saying, as sound went with the look he was giving me, \u201cI\u2019ll swing by later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. He was coming over? All nerve endings went on sweat mode.</p><p>Noah looked at me questioningly, and I looked back and forth between them for clarification.</p><p>\u201cYou can have him to yourself for a little while,\u201d Noah said slowly. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll pick him up later to go get some dinner and a beer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cThat sounds great. Absolutely.\u201d I wondered if he\u2019d want to start drinking early. Since my baby boy was now suddenly past drinking age. My brain needed massaging. And something to do. So I grabbed my phone.</p><p>\u201cPut your heads together,\u201d I said, not even letting myself think about it first. We needed new pictures of him. The look in Noah\u2019s eyes as he looked at me for the photo was a sacrifice I\u2019d have to make when I looked at it five hundred more times that night. Right.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Shayna said, pulling her phone out to click away as well.</p><p>Noah chuckled. \u201cGood luck over there,\u201d he said, nudging Seth.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, tossing a carrot at him. \u201cBe nice.\u201d Food fights were progress, right?</p><p>\u201cJust saying, if your daughter and grandmother show up, he\u2019ll have three generations of women on his plate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d I said. \u201cI so hope you have a daughter, so you can truly have all that testosterone handed to you in a pink teacup and tiara.\u201d</p><p>Both men laughed, Noah\u2019s face and body relaxing. For that one tiny second, even for me, it was easy. Till he looked at Shayna and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked at her and she\u2019d gone white. Like gray-white. \u201cShayna?\u201d I said, touching her arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said, smiling it off but not too convincingly. \u201cJust feeling a little puny is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get you something?\u201d Noah asked, grabbing her hand. Six inches from mine. Not that I noticed. At all. \u201cNeed to go home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, y\u2019all go ahead,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll head to my house from here.\u201d</p><p>Noah paid the check and I didn\u2019t miss the look of enormous relief that came over his features when Shayna got up and we weren\u2019t side-by-side anymore. Guess it was a little wiggly from his side, too.</p> <p>He slapped Seth on the back. \u201cSee you later, bud,\u201d he said.</p><p>Knowing him, he\u2019d thought about that since we\u2019d sat down. What to say to sound nonchalant. He couldn\u2019t say son, and Seth was so two hours ago. Bud would work. Perfect mix of affection and respectable distance.</p><p>I also didn\u2019t miss the slight hesitance in his step as he passed me and the melting look he gave me. I ran a hand through my hair and waited for the feeling to come back to my tongue. Damn him and those looks.</p><p>Of course if I hadn\u2019t been looking up at him . . .</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d Seth asked, a hint of a knowing smile playing at his lips.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said. \u201cA stop or two first.\u201d</p><p>We ducked into the bookstore for a bit so I could introduce him better to Ruthie. She cried again, hugged him whether he wanted it or not, and gave him two fresh-baked peanut butter cookies and a book to take with him.</p><p>That\u2019s what made her Ruthie.</p><p>I called Nana Mae, but there was no answer, so I left her a message.</p><p>\u201cI figure you\u2019re probably out walking, so call me when you get this, or come by the house. And just so there\u2019s so cardiac arrest involved, I have more than pictures now.\u201d I glanced at the man in my passenger seat. \u201cSeth is here. In person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes me sound famous,\u201d he said. \u201cLike Pink. Or Usher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I would have gone with Sting or Madonna,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe Cher. But I\u2019m old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are famous to us,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been the secret on the shelf for too long. You coming out to shine makes it the best day ever.\u201d</p><p>Seth took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. \u201cI\u2019m glad. You never know what reactions might be.\u201d He raised his eyebrows as we turned into a residential section. \u201cI read so many horror stories online about meet-ups gone wrong. I nearly turned around and drove back home the second I got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I said, feeling the tug at my insides. \u201cBut you said Noah\u2019s dad got in touch with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that was just a grandfather. It wasn\u2019t you or Noah.\u201d I stopped to meet his eyes at a stop sign. \u201cHe wanted to surprise his son. That could have gone twenty different ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re right,\u201d I said. \u201cI bet that was scary. Thank you for not going home.\u201d</p><p>Seth smiled, a little crooked, and the Noah of two decades ago peeked out. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I faced forward and continued driving, determined not to get mushy. \u201cSo, Detective,\u201d I began, trying to lighten the subject. \u201cI don\u2019t see a wedding ring on your finger. Anyone special in your life?\u201d</p><p>And my attempt at lightening was probably the most awkward thing ever to come out of my mouth. All these years, he\u2019d been a baby. A child at most. Here he was a man, and I was asking him if he had a woman. I might as well check his wallet for condoms while I was at it.</p><p>A sigh laced with a bit of frustration came from his side of the car. He raked his fingers through his short hair.</p><p>\u201cThere was.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth and closed it again. Don\u2019t be awkward a second time. It was a harmless question but might not be to him. Might be huge. Might be too personal to talk about with someone he just met a few hours ago.</p><p>\u201cI was engaged, actually,\u201d he continued, canceling out my self-flogging. \u201cFor a whole four months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it it didn\u2019t end well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said on a sigh. \u201cBest way to kill a good relationship is to put a ring on it,\u201d he said, smiling at his joke. But the smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cWe were together for three years before that. We should have just dated for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said. \u201cI hate to hear that.\u201d I was. I wanted to go beat up the girl that hurt my baby and made his eyes look like that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have known it was too easy with her. Too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something to that,\u201d I said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s the harder relationships, the complicated ones you have to fight and claw for that have staying power. May give you gray hair and bruises, but, you know.\u201d</p><p>Seth laughed. \u201cProbably one of the things that spurred me on to find where I came from. I needed a diversion. And a connection.\u201d He paused and looked my way. \u201cI\u2019m really glad this went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I said, rounding onto my street. Becca\u2019s car was in the driveway. At one in the afternoon on a school day. I blew out a breath. \u201cHold on to that thought, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot sure, but my Spidey sense is all twitchy.\u201d</p><p>I pulled next to her little blue car and got out, staring a hole in the front door as I approached it. The door wasn\u2019t locked, and we were greeted to a dancing Harley as she viewed Seth as new love. He instantly went to one knee and got acquainted, all the while absorbing the room in seconds.</p><p>\u201cBecca?\u201d I called.</p><p>The thump from above didn\u2019t give me a warm fuzzy. Then her door squeaked open at the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>Yeah? Seriously? \u201cBecca!\u201d</p><p>A sigh that had an audible eye roll with it traveled the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>The door closed, and she headed down, her steps quick. Her lopsided hair swung out to the side as she came into view and opened her mouth to argue, but whatever words she had at the ready stuck there when she saw Seth petting Harley. She glanced at me in question.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you home?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Her eyes went back to him. \u201cWhy are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecca.\u201d</p><p>Thank God she still had respect for \u201cthe tone.\u201d I didn\u2019t use it often, wanting it to be the sound of doom that would stop her in her tracks when I really needed it. This qualified. She straightened up and fiddled with the railing in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t feeling well,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school didn\u2019t call me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I just\u2014\u201d She paused and her eyes darted to Seth again. He stood up, causing Harley to climb his leg in protest.</p><p>\u201cYou just came home without telling anyone,\u201d I said, rubbing my forehead. When would it stop?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal, Mom,\u201d she said. \u201cYou make too much of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, truancy is a big deal,\u201d Seth said, causing her head to snap in his direction again. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, raising his hands to me in apology. \u201cMy thoughts get away from me sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are?\u201d Becca said, coming down the last three steps with what I guessed she thought was sudden seniority.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d he said, holding out a hand with a half smile on his face. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Becca\u2019s mouth fell open. Boy, I was glad I\u2019d told her, as she looked at me and back at him again. \u201cLike, Seth? That Seth?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cThere I am being famous again. Yes, that Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, holy shit,\u201d she said under her breath as she walked forward slowly and took his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re my brother?\u201d</p><p>My heart slammed against my ribs. God, what a sentence and what a sight. I never in a million years expected to look at the two of them standing in the same room. I almost stopped being mad at her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the rumor,\u201d he said softly, a smile playing at his lips.</p><p>\u201cI just found out about you two days ago,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI just found out about you two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Becca laughed, and even as that put my heart at ease, I saw Seth\u2019s eyes narrow a little.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you have any other brothers or sisters?\u201d she asked. \u201cLike, that you grew up with?\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes glazed over a bit. \u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a little brother who was adopted, too. \u201cHis name was Shon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid?\u201d she asked, picking up on something I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he died six years ago,\u201d he said, averting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d I said, my chest contracting. The pain in his expression was palpable. \u201cSeth, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and put his hands in his pockets, a self-protecting gesture that made him suddenly look younger.</p><p>\u201cIt was a stupid accident,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was\u2014\u201d</p><p>A thud from overhead halted his words.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d I said.</p><p>Both hands were out of his pockets and he was at the base of the stairs in insta-cop mode in two-point-five seconds. I would have followed, but I was watching Becca. And she wasn\u2019t startled. Her glance upward wasn\u2019t questioning or scared, it was panicked.</p><p>It was busted.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s upstairs?\u201d I asked.</p><p>My tone was calm, and in that moment I was very proud of my control. Seth stopped his progression mid-step and looked at me.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d she said defensively. \u201cNobody.\u201d</p><p>Her worry over where Seth was standing, however, told otherwise. As did a second thump and the subsequent creaking.</p><p>\u201cBecca, who is in this house?\u201d I repeated. The tone was making a comeback. \u201cAlone with you. In the middle of a school day and work day when you didn\u2019t think anyone would be home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s not like that,\u201d she said, holding up her palms.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me what it\u2019s like, then,\u201d I said. \u201cBefore I go find out for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark, come down!\u201d she yelled upward, darting one look at me and then at the floor.</p><p>\u201cMark,\u201d I whispered, closing my eyes. Not because I was being nice. More because my rage had taken the power of speech away.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecca Ann White,\u201d I began, not caring anymore that Seth was seeing all this. So damn be it. \u201cWhat is the rule on boys in this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDownstairs, I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about when I\u2019m not home?\u201d I said, hearing the rise in pitch.</p><p>\u201cNo one at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd during school hours?\u201d I said. No\u2014I yelled it. I did.</p><p>Her eyebrows dipped into a frown. \u201cDuring school hours? There\u2019s not a rule for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly!\u201d I said, walking closer and enjoying the look on her face that questioned my sanity just a little. Good. She needed to worry. \u201cBecause you are supposed to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d The death glare.</p><p>This was why wild animals sometimes eat their young.</p><p>And the boy still hadn\u2019t made an appearance. \u201cMark!\u201d I yelled. \u201cThe stairs aren\u2019t that hard to find, young man. Please get down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Becca said, her eyes filling with angry tears. \u201cI hate you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good,\u201d I said under my breath as a little piece of my soul broke away. \u201cI\u2019m doing my job. What the living hell are you thinking, skipping school and bringing him here?\u201d</p><p>Feet appeared in my line of vision. Big sneakers, followed by baggy jeans and a jersey sweatshirt. The face it was all attached to looked worried. Well, at least he was that smart. He paused at the bottom as Seth stared at him for a beat before letting him pass.</p><p>He stood next to Becca, who did nothing but glare at me through her tears. Disgusted, I thrust my hand into the boy\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Becca\u2019s mom, by the way,\u201d I said. \u201cSince you are too rude to step up, and she\u2019s too rude to introduce you, I\u2019ll do that myself.\u201d</p><p>Becca\u2019s mouth fell open, as if she couldn\u2019t believe I could still shock her. Mark mumbled something including his name and how nice it was to meet me. I think. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Seth grin and look away. I wondered if his\u2014mother\u2014had ever had to do the same.</p><p>\u201cMark, I would\u2019ve liked to have met you a different way, but since I didn\u2019t, let me fill you in. Becca isn\u2019t allowed to skip class. Don\u2019t know if you are, but she\u2019s not. You aren\u2019t allowed in her room. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Echoes of my mother\u2019s voice rang in my head, but I was too far gone to think about that.</p><p>\u201cYou will respect those things, and keep all your personal property in your pants, and we will get along just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d she yelled, tears fully streaming down her face, black eyeliner coming with it.</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Mark said, his words barely heard over Becca\u2019s carrying on.</p><p>\u201cYou can go, Mark,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI drove,\u201d Becca said through her sobs.</p><p>\u201cHe looks like he can handle a six-block walk, Becca,\u201d I said. \u201cMark, have a good day.\u201d</p><p>He wheeled around with big eyes and briefly squeezed her hand as he passed. Didn\u2019t make it three more steps, however, before Seth deftly plucked an object from the side cargo pocket of the baggy jeans.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re quite old enough for this,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>A stainless steel flask. Joy. Becca\u2019s face contorted as if she\u2019d seen death up close and personal.</p><p>\u201cUnless you have lemonade in here\u2014\u201d Seth unscrewed the top and sniffed. \u201cWhoa, most definitely not lemonade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s mine,\u201d Mark said, attempting to bow up with whatever he had under the three-sizes-too-big clothing.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Seth said, holding up the flask. \u201cYours? You bought this yourself? I\u2019m impressed. You must have one hell of an ID.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-one,\u201d Mark said.</p><p>Seth laughed. \u201cYeah, I can see that. Why don\u2019t we call the school and see if maybe they have something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Mark muttered. \u201cOkay, it\u2019s my dad\u2019s. Just\u2014can I have it, please? I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Seth said. \u201cKitchen?\u201d he asked me in passing. I pointed, and he walked around the corner, leaving a perplexed kid in the entryway. I heard the sound of liquid going down a drain, and then he was back. \u201cHere you go,\u201d he said. \u201cTell your dad he has good taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right acting like this,\u201d Becca said. \u201cYou\u2019re not family.\u201d</p><p>To his credit, he only faltered a second. Me, on the other hand\u2014I saw ten shades of red.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, putting a hand on my arm before I could say a word. \u201cBut I am an officer of the law, so . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a prince,\u201d Becca said, acid dripping from her tone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that a lot,\u201d he said, opening the door for Mark.</p><p>When he closed it back, I focused on Becca. On her hate, her embarrassment, and my own disappointment and absolute mortification that the meeting with Seth went so sour.</p><p>\u201cDrinking, Bec?\u201d I said, my voice cracking. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hadn\u2019t even had any yet,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYet,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhere\u2019s your head?\u201d</p><p>Her fists went up in her hair, like she wanted to pull it out. \u201cOh, my God, I wish I was anywhere else but here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be. Clean yourself up and get back to school,\u201d I said, feeling all the inflection go out of my voice. I was so angry that she\u2019d blown my trust. Again.</p><p>She swiped at her face, essentially just smearing black around. \u201cAre you kidding me? There\u2019s like an hour and a half left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better hurry it up,\u201d I said.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes and scoffed and wheeled around in disgust. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you,\u201d she said on her way up the stairs. She stopped and I had the feeling something profound was coming. \u201cYou humiliated me today.\u201d Or that.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d I said through my teeth.</p><p>Becca glanced at Seth and back at me. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll bet. Awfully high and mighty on the subject of boys, aren\u2019t you\u2014since your stellar example of restraint is standing here?\u201d</p><p>I felt all the blood drain from my face, and the quiet was deafening. I saw it\u2014the moment that passed through her brain when she knew she\u2019d gone too far. I had a fleeting thought through the pounding in my ears that that was at least proof she still had a conscience. Then I turned and walked to the kitchen.</p><p>I pulled two glasses from the cabinet and started to fill them with ice when I heard footsteps behind me. Heavier footsteps than Becca\u2019s. Slower.</p><p>\u201cI have sweet tea, water, and orange juice,\u201d I said, opening the fridge. I stared at the pitchers without seeing them and grabbed one of them without feeling it in my hand.</p><p>\u201cSweet tea is fine.\u201d</p><p>I turned to look at my son. A man. Standing in my kitchen. Not too many days back, I was in awe of seeing his father occupying that same space. It was surreal.</p><p>He pointed at the pitcher I was holding. \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d he reiterated.</p><p>I looked down at it and realized it was the tea. \u201cOkay,\u201d I said, pouring into both glasses.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. I wasn\u2019t. I was numb. I was standing in my kitchen, talking to my son. Talking to my son. A miracle of all miracles. And I was mortified and horrified and distraught. Where had I gone wrong with her? How could she talk to me that way? How did it get this far?</p><p>\u201cJuliann\u2014I mean\u2014\u201d Seth stopped and let out a wary breath. \u201cI just realized I haven\u2019t called you by anything yet. What do I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people call me Jules,\u201d I said. \u201cYour gran\u2014\u201d Yeah, I was doing it, too. \u201cMy dad gave me that nickname when I was little and it stuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Jules, you don\u2019t seem okay,\u201d he said, pulling up a nearby stool. \u201cAnd that would be okay if you\u2019re not. You don\u2019t have to pretend anything. That was pretty intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntense.\u201d I sank onto a stool and buried my face in my hands. \u201cI am so sorry you had to witness that,\u201d I said. \u201cThat thing you said about never knowing how these things are going to turn out\u2014well, I guess I just made your case for the dark side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Seth said, resting his elbows on the counter. \u201cY\u2019all have been great. And Becca\u2019ll come around. Was she upset about me when you told her?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNot about you. I think she was kind of intrigued by the idea, actually. It was my keeping it from her all this time that hit her buttons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why did I? I listened to my breath going in and out. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cI told myself I was protecting her, but that wasn\u2019t it. I think it was just more of my mother\u2019s voice saying to keep it all quiet.\u201d I looked him in the eye. \u201cI have no good answer for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstandable, too,\u201d he said, pausing. \u201cCan I be honest with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Seth averted his gaze, studying his hands. \u201cShe\u2019s a rebel. She\u2019s testing boundaries.\u201d He met my eyes. \u201cShon was like that, too. Me\u2014I was probably an easy kid, but Shon was hard to follow sometimes. He was always bucking the rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Becca,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMy parents were kind of sticklers about rules, too,\u201d he said, blinking his gaze down. \u201cAnd being the one usually watching the showdowns, I always wanted to ask them to back off a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said everything was good,\u201d I said, feeling a frown dip my eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it was,\u201d he said. \u201cOur house was normal\u2014but normal has chaos, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd it seemed like the more my parents cracked down, the more Shon fought back.\u201d</p><p>Our eyes met for a long moment. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe got in some trouble,\u201d Seth said, looking into his glass as though the story was in there. \u201cI tried to help him, but he needed a different kind of help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney to pay off debt\u2014at nineteen years old,\u201d Seth added, bitterness entering his voice. \u201cHe got mixed up with bad people, and then thought drowning his problems in a bottle would stop it.\u201d He looked at me. \u201cIt did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I whispered.</p> <p>\u201cSo he got behind the wheel after partying one night, and ended up dead,\u201d Seth said, upending his glass and draining the tea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI was twenty-one,\u201d he said. \u201cJust finishing up college. It\u2019s part of what pushed me to join the police academy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did your parents handle it?\u201d I asked, unable to imagine losing a child that way.</p><p>I\u2019d lost one, too. But I knew he was still breathing. And then the most awful realization hit me. I hadn\u2019t known, not really. I guess my mother did, but I didn\u2019t. Shon\u2019s birth mother\u2014she probably had no idea.</p><p>\u201cLike you\u2019d expect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was hard to leave them after that, but they wanted me to go after what I wanted, so I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they\u2014\u201d I stopped and took a sip of my untouched tea, then got up to refill his glass. \u201cDo they know you came to find us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad does,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom\u2014she\u2019d probably be okay with it, but I just didn\u2019t want to put that on her yet. At least not till I had something to tell. After Lisa bailed on the wedding and all\u2014she would have just worried.\u201d</p> <p>I smiled. \u201cShe sounds like we\u2019d have a lot in common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very similar, actually,\u201d he said on a chuckle. \u201cEerily so.\u201d</p><p>Becca came into the room, looking somber and clean-faced. \u201cI need a note to get back in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was your plan?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t thought that far,\u201d she said, nothing in her eyes. Nothing in her expression. She handed me a pen and piece of notebook paper. \u201cJust\u2014please write whatever you\u2019re gonna write.\u201d</p><p>She knew me. She knew I\u2019d write something like, Please let Becca White back in school today, she was stupid and skipped class without my knowledge.</p><p>She knew that because it\u2019s exactly what I would have done. As I looked at the trouble in her face and heard Seth\u2019s words, however, I paused.</p><p>I looked at the blank page with its rumpled edges, pulled from some dark cave of her backpack, and started writing. When I handed it to her, she snatched it and walked off, but stopped at the doorway as she started reading. She turned back around with a question in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it your freebie,\u201d I said. \u201cWith the school, not with me.\u201d</p><p>It would be a little while before we were good again. Her gaze darted to Seth and then to the floor, and she nodded and walked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you write?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTo excuse her for a family emergency and that she\u2019d be back the next day,\u201d I said, wishing I could put my head in my glass. My face felt on fire.</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, caving\u2019s not really my thing,\u201d I said, rubbing my forehead. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure how smart it was. Especially after her mouth overloaded her brain like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMassively.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said. \u201cMaybe your story about your brother. Maybe some things I\u2019ve been thinking about my own mother.\u201d I looked at the empty doorway where she\u2019d just exited. \u201cI just know something has to change.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>We spent the next few hours catching up on twenty-six years. I told him his birth story\u2014the one Becca described with such flare. I told him about Noah and me, and my parents, and Noah\u2019s dad. About the animosity and the drama. Spent some detail on my mother\u2014as fun as that was\u2014and I showed him the pictures I\u2019d found after Noah returned to town. We made plans with Nana Mae to maybe hook up the next morning, at which point I hoped he\u2019d get a different perspective on my mom. I just couldn\u2019t go there, yet.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said, flipping over a particularly good depiction in the pile of a squirrel stuck in a tree. \u201cI never knew about any deal for a trust fund,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mom showed it to me when I turned twenty-one, said that my biological family had set it up. Honestly, I didn\u2019t give it a lot of thought. I just left it there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at what was essentially his life in pictures. \u201cI guess my mom had secrets, too,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe all parents do. Do you?\u201d he added.</p><p>I smiled sadly. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Becca like to do?\u201d he said, the turn of subject taking me off guard.</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014she writes,\u201d I said. \u201cCarries a notebook with her everywhere. Other than that, she\u2019s attached to her phone twenty-four-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind if I go spend a few minutes with her before Noah comes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>It was endearing and hurl-worthy at the same time, because I\u2019d managed to forget that Noah was coming.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said, grabbing our glasses and heading to the sink. \u201cGood luck!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then again, I\u2019m a boy,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I allowed up there?\u201d</p><p>I wheeled around to give him a look, and he started laughing, pointing at me.</p><p>\u201cI wondered what your mom look would be,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip and instantly dialed back whatever might be glowing in neon across my face. \u201cBoy, I\u2019ll bet you were fun,\u201d I said, tossing a dishrag at him.</p><p>He laughed and ducked and headed up the stairs, as I stood there and soaked in the five-second normal mother-and-son moment we\u2019d kind of just shared. My chest tightened up and my eyes filled, and I blinked it all away while I rinsed our glasses and put them in the dishwasher.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>When the doorbell rang an hour later, Harley and I both jumped. It had taken me probably forty-five minutes of that to relax and quit peering up the stairway and finally sit down with a book. Not that a single word had registered with me. Harley was in my lap\u2014or part of her was\u2014and the tension had started to unknot itself.</p><p>At the sound of Noah arriving, however, I felt my neck turn back into an intricate web. I could make some chiropractor very wealthy. Especially with the added fun of Harley using my torso as a springboard.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I groaned as she pushed off and I took my time getting up.</p><p>On the one hand, it was nerve-wracking with the two of them up there talking about things I didn\u2019t know. I\u2019d been ready for Seth to come down for thirty minutes. And God, what a control freak I was!</p><p>But on the other hand, Noah coming meant he had to leave, and I could spend weeks living off the joy of that afternoon. Something I never, ever thought I\u2019d do\u2014hang out with my son.</p><p>Noah coming also meant Noah was coming. And would be standing outside my door looking like\u2014I opened the door\u2014yep, looking just like that.</p><p>Hands in the pockets of his leather jacket, over clothes that I now knew packaged a dream body, warm and solid. A hooded gaze that absorbed me just as well in my green sweater dress and bare feet.</p><p>Shit, he looked like sex dipped in chocolate.</p><p>Harley must have entertained that thought as well, because she went straight for his crotch.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, deflecting her like a pro.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I knew he was thinking about the last time he\u2019d walked through that door. Two days ago. God, that was only two days ago?</p><p>\u201cIs he ready to go?\u201d</p><p>I laughed nervously, the moment striking me as one of many of Hayden picking up Becca when she was younger.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Dad, he probably is,\u201d I said, holding the door open and standing aside so I could smell him as he walked by. Multitasking. \u201cHe\u2019s been upstairs with Becca for an hour. Hopefully he\u2019s still in one piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did she react?\u201d he asked, his eyes falling to the rug of sin.</p><p>\u201cOh, it depends on the day, evidently,\u201d I said, willing to do a jig just to get his eyes off that spot. \u201cPossibly the hour.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to me, pinning me with that look of his, and I was thinking the rug wasn\u2019t so bad. I could hear my blood move. His hand came up within inches of my face, and then snapped down, his fingers closing in. He stepped closer and fought his hand again like he couldn\u2019t stand not to touch me.</p><p>\u201cS-so\u2014how\u2019s Shayna?\u201d I slurred like I was having a stroke, which wasn\u2019t completely out of the question.</p><p>He blinked but otherwise didn\u2019t look away. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. This how it\u2019s gonna be for the rest of our lives?\u201d He pointed between us. \u201cThis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. Sort of. Or I mouthed it, really. But as closely as he was watching my mouth, I was pretty sure he caught it.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the only one that hasn\u2019t been able to love anyone, Jules,\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve tried. Shayna\u2019s the only one to come close, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d My mouth went dry and my palms started to sweat.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one woman that ever fit that bill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I betrayed that,\u201d I said. \u201cI know. And you walked away from it. Together we set a chain of crap in motion, Noah. Twenty-plus years of baggage and lost time.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer and reached for my face again, his eyes tortured. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>I grasped his hand to stop him, but the touch took my thoughts away like they were dust. I inhaled a little gasp and closed my eyes, squeezing his hand to my chest for just one second. Just one second. Don\u2019t let go.</p><p>I smiled and pushed the hurt away, opening my eyes and lowering his hand. \u201cYes, you can. We can.\u201d I let his hand go, wanting to back up a step, but my feet had glued themselves to that damn rug. My voice sounded oddly high, probably because the words were complete bunk. I didn\u2019t believe them any more than he did, but someone had to make a stand. \u201cYou have obligations now. And she doesn\u2019t deserve less than all of you.\u201d</p><p>There were sounds of life above our heads and Becca\u2019s door opened. Noah shook his head slowly\u2014more to himself than to me.</p><p>And \u201cLove Shack\u201d rang at his hip.</p><p>\u201cOh, that fucking song,\u201d I muttered under my breath as I spun around to put some space between us. I walked across the room, finding nonexistent things to pick up as I gulped air. Harley followed me just in case, her nose twitching in interest.</p><p>Noah grumbled something I couldn\u2019t make out as he silenced the phone and the kids came down the stairs. The kids came down the stairs.</p><p>Did I actually just think that? I really must be stroking. I turned to see Becca leading the way as Seth followed. Neither of them were really kids anymore, especially not Seth, but still. It was a moment.</p><p>I pasted on a smile and joined them, and Noah held out a hand to Becca. She stared at it like he was offering her a firecracker.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t officially met,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m Noah Ryan.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand with a small smile. \u201cBecca White. Wow, you two really do look alike.\u201d</p><p>Noah beamed, whether he was aware of it or not, and Seth smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you favor your mom,\u201d Seth said, of course registering with me right away that he hadn\u2019t said just Mom or our mom, but that was just my crazy peeking out. \u201cExcept for this side,\u201d Seth continued, batting at the long side of her hair. \u201cSo, do you start leaning this way after a while?\u201d he asked, cocking his head to one side. \u201cMaybe walk in circles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d she said, punching him in the arm and then aiming for his head, for which he was too quick. She may have acted put off, but I saw something different in her face. Something needy.</p><p>\u201cCoffee tomorrow?\u201d Seth said, looking at me.</p><p>Oh, he drank coffee. I loved him even more.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time are you up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I\u2019ll get up at three in the morning if you ask me to.</p><p>\u201cSeven?\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to be at the store till nine thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then,\u201d he said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cSee you then,\u201d I echoed.</p><p>Noah\u2019s phone went off again, just as I was standing next to him again. Jesus, it was like she sensed the proximity. He hit the button, his jaw tight.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not much of a texter, is she?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, I like that song,\u201d Becca said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I used to, too,\u201d I said. Out loud. Unintentionally. \u201cHave fun tonight,\u201d I added quickly, putting on a smile.</p><p>Seth hooked an arm around Becca\u2019s neck and hugged her, then me. For real. On his own terms this time. He smiled down at me, so grown up, and of course I teared up. What the hell else did I do anymore?</p><p>I swatted at his chest and laughed as I swiped at my eyes. \u201cGo on,\u201d I said. \u201cY\u2019all get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Seth backed up and then Noah\u2019s hand was squeezing mine like it finally won the battle. He looked down at the union like he was surprised, and then let go, looking up at me with a sadness.</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d I whispered. It was all my brain could muster. And the kick to my gut felt like much more.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>When the door shut, the only noise was Harley\u2019s tail thumping against a metal vase. I turned to see Becca standing with her arms crossed, not quite looking at me. I wasn\u2019t up for that showdown again. Not just yet. I wanted to know how it went with Seth, but we weren\u2019t in that place. So I walked around her to my favorite spot on one of the couches, sat with a pillow in my lap, and opened my book.</p><p>Slow footsteps faded upward as she went to her room, but to my surprise the sounds came back down again. I glanced up from the pages I again wasn\u2019t reading to see her sit tentatively on the opposite couch, notebook and pen in hand.</p><p>\u201cMind if I sit in here with you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I shook my head as all the strings of my heart yanked at the same time.</p><p>She scooted back and arranged herself to be cocooned with pillows and an afghan, then opened her notebook and hovered her pen for just a second.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d she said, not looking up. One corner of her mouth twitched upward as if she were remembering something funny. \u201cSeth\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an apology, but it was her version of working up to one. She met my eyes for the briefest of seconds and then started scribbling madly in her book. I focused on the pages in front of me and let the words seep in.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The next morning started with a ring of my doorbell that I expected to be Seth. I had coffee ready, as well as biscuits and honey. Just in case. Not from scratch or anything, let\u2019s not get crazy. And I figured that serving him a sliced apple probably wouldn\u2019t have screamed motherly.</p><p>The view I received when I opened the door was even better. Nana Mae, arm in arm with a grinning Seth. Her with big fat tears in her eyes, a photo album, and a big bag of donuts. She understood mothering a lot better than I did.</p><p>\u201cLook who I found outside!\u201d she said, her voice trembling with joy.</p><p>We had a sugar feast, went down a deeper rendition of memory lane, and fought Harley for the donuts and biscuits, although I suspected that Seth was sneaking her bites on the side.</p><p>Becca got ready early for school and actually stuck around for a bit before leaving. Granted, the contraband food didn\u2019t hurt. There still wasn\u2019t conversation of any real quality between she and I, just the obligatory Q&amp;A, but that was on her this time. She was going to have to throw the first flag. Truancy, boys in her room, and alcohol\u2014all in one day\u2014my mother would have stroked on the spot. I was doing pretty well, I thought. It dawned on me to call Hayden. He would think I should. Which was precisely why I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Nana Mae and Seth left together, her insisting that he come over and help her get some things down from the attic. She hadn\u2019t been up in that attic in over five years, maybe more, but I kept that little detail to myself.</p><p>I plopped onto the couch after they were gone and leaned over onto a pillow so Harley and I could be eye to eye. Also because I honestly could have fallen asleep like that. Meeting Seth the day before, wondering about his dinner with Noah (that I had not asked one word about over coffee, I was proud to say), on top of Becca\u2019s antics had put my brain on overdrive. It just wouldn\u2019t shut off.</p><p>I was mostly ready for work, anyway. Ready in a very going-casual-today kind of way. Jeans again. How far I\u2019d fallen. My mom would have grimaced. And on that note, I wondered what Ruthie would say if I showed up in my robe.</p><p>At any rate, a few minutes of lazy time couldn\u2019t hurt, and Harley was closing her eyes as well as I scratched her favorite spot under her chin. It was one of those comfortable moments when you feel that pull into the black hole, when\u2014the doorbell rang again.</p><p>Harley jumped, her closed eyes now wide in panic as she ran to the door and sniffed once and took up her barking medley. I groaned and pulled myself off the couch, wondering who had forgotten what and when my door had become so friggin\u2019 popular.</p><p>And opened the door to Shayna. Before I could even register that something was off about her\u2014the crooked and straggly ponytail, the red puffy eyes and no makeup\u2014she came running in past me.</p><p>\u201cUm, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked, shutting the door.</p><p>A new wave of tears flooded her eyes and streaked down reddened cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIs Noah here?\u201d</p><p>What? Guilt, panic, and major backpedaling flooded my brain. \u201cHere? No! Why would he be here?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath of something that looked panicked, and yet a little relieved at the same time.</p><p>\u201cNoah\u2019s gone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah\u2019s gone.</p><p>The last time I heard those words they were coming from Ruthie, as she had burst into my bedroom breathlessly. She didn\u2019t have a car yet and had run all the way from the diner. She flopped across my bed where I was curled up in hiding, and heaved like she\u2019d been chased by rabid dogs.</p><p>I remember how my hand had gone straight to my belly at the sound of his name, it still being soft and mushy and not quite shrinking yet. Drawings littered the floor\u2014my practice drawings for what would be the painting.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone\u2014like really gone,\u201d she had said. \u201cMoved to his Uncle Gerard\u2019s in San Antonio and joined the Navy! Linny was crying about it.\u201d</p> <p>Linny didn\u2019t cry back then. That made it real.</p><p>Everything went sideways after that.</p><p>Shayna standing in my living room looking like she\u2019d just done a running of the bulls and lost, telling me those same words, made my throat close up.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, he\u2019s gone?\u201d I said, the words falling off my tongue like someone else was saying them. Echoing like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>She held her hands over her face and sank onto the arm of the nearest couch. Near the rug. Too near the rug. It was sick that that was what spurred me into motion, but I rushed forward and guided her around to sit on the couch. Where neither of us could see the place where I\u2019d nearly banged the father of her child. Although technically he was the father of my child, too.</p> <p>\u201cHe left,\u201d she said tearfully. \u201cSometime last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night?\u201d I repeated. \u201cNo, he was with Seth last night.\u201d</p><p>Why would he leave? His son was here, she was here, his baby was here. I\u2019m here.</p><p>\u201cAfter that,\u201d she said, sobs making her breaths come in jerky little gasps. \u201cWhen he finally came home. During the night sometime after we\u2014I thought he\u2019d gone to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy finally?\u201d I asked, knowing I sounded too interested but unable to stop. \u201cWhat do you mean, finally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to tell him,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell him what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as he left the house to get Seth, I knew,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait. I called and called. Was going to tell him to come home early, but he wouldn\u2019t pick up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove Shack.\u201d</p><p>She was talking like a zombie. Like I wasn\u2019t in the room and she was just unloading her burdens to the air. And it was a little bit freaky. Shayna was the most calm and together person I knew besides Ruthie. Or at least as much as I could tell in the week I\u2019d known her. And she was unraveling in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI knew it was a horrible time, but I just couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t what, Shayna?\u201d I asked, my patience waning. Becca was still swimming around the front of my mind, and my ice was already thin these days. It didn\u2019t take much.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t keep up the lie anymore,\u201d she said, whispering the words. \u201cNot after seeing him and his son together. I had to\u2014had to come clean.\u201d</p><p>My skin tingled. She had my full attention now. I couldn\u2019t ask another question, I just waited. I wasn\u2019t sure I really wanted to know anymore.</p> <p>\u201cThe guy I told you about?\u201d she said, looking at me for the first time since she\u2019d arrived, her eyes red-rimmed and swollen. \u201cThat stalked me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name was Thomas,\u201d she said in a whisper, as if someone might hear. \u201cThe baby is his.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>You reach a point where you think there can be no more surprises.</p><p>Shayna\u2019s words pinged off the walls like they had nowhere to land. I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d I said, my voice gone husky.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the truth,\u201d she cried, her whole body crumpling.</p><p>The baby wasn\u2019t Noah\u2019s. Holy shit, that information should have been liberating. Those obligations that were anchoring him\u2014fading away. But it wasn\u2019t like that. It was\u2014oh, dear God, that baby wasn\u2019t Noah\u2019s. And all I could think about was him hearing her say those words and the horror he had to have felt of seeing another child yanked away.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d sat until I found myself springing to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014why?\u201d I asked, pacing and swiping at the tears that came unbidden. Oh, my God, Noah had to be devastated. And gone. \u201cWhere did he go, Shayna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid he take his truck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That was good. He couldn\u2019t leave the country on foot, at least. I wheeled around.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she said imploringly. \u201cNot on purpose. We were already back together when I found out I was pregnant.\u201d She shut her eyes and held her palms against her temples. \u201cI thought it was his\u2014God, I wanted it to be his. He\u2014he was so happy.\u201d</p><p>I could picture his joy. Hearing that news again. And not being seventeen and still in high school.</p><p>\u201cHe got down on one knee and proposed,\u201d she said, looking down in front of her like he was there. \u201cI wanted it, Jules. I wanted the fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d she breathed. \u201cOh, I should have. I know that. But I wanted to forget about Thomas and his psycho mind games.\u201d Sobs racked her body again. \u201cI believed in me and Noah. I bought into the thought of our little family.\u201d</p><p>I remembered believing in that once, too. So did Noah.</p><p>\u201cThen I had my second appointment, and\u2014\u201d Shayna closed her eyes again, pushing new tears forward. \u201cWhen they said how far along I was, I wanted to die. All I could think of was how could I take it all back now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much like you did last night, I expect,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he was crushed!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Shayna,\u201d I said, wanting to throttle her cute little neck. \u201cHe moved across the planet for this. For you. To raise his child around family. Told everyone he knows. Again,\u201d I added, feeling sick.</p><p>\u201cI thought it would work,\u201d she said, the sobs stealing her breath. \u201cHe would love me again. We would be happy.\u201d She took a deep breath and wiped at her face. \u201cThen we came here.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cDon\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t blame the town for this going south. You had to know it would come back somehow.\u201d</p><p>Shayna met my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming anything. I\u2019m just saying this was the beginning of the end, coming here.\u201d She laughed bitterly. \u201cWe came here for a future together, but there is no future here. There\u2019s only past.\u201d</p><p>I looked down, knowing instinctively what that meant, and I couldn\u2019t argue with it. She reached for my hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dogging you for that,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2014it is what it is. I thought that what we had was enough until we came here. I mean\u2014he holds people at arm\u2019s length, he always has. I assumed that\u2019s just the way he was, but\u2014then we came here. And there was a difference. He looks at me and sees the sweet love affair we\u2019ve had. He looks at you and sees an entire life he\u2019s missed.\u201d She looked away. \u201cYou are everything to him, and I don\u2019t think he even knew that until he saw you.\u201d Her eyes fluttered. \u201cHe will never look at me that way, Jules. I could give him ten babies and it wouldn\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said, rooted to the floor. And I meant that. Regardless of what she\u2019d done, no woman deserved to have to fight a losing battle for their own man.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I wanted to hate you,\u201d she said on a teary chuckle. \u201cI tried to. But God help me, I ended up really liking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I said, squeezing her hand back. Trouble crossed her features again, and it was time to move forward. \u201cShayna, what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>Oh, holy hell, that was bad.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him who it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew,\u201d Shayna said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it was even about that. All that mattered was that it wasn\u2019t Noah.\u201d</p><p>Emotion choked me, and my chest felt like someone was squeezing it. \u201cDid he get mad?\u201d I managed. \u201cCry? Yell?\u201d Anything besides the stare of the dead that I\u2019m sure she got a load of.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a few seconds. \u201cHe just\u2014went away. Like he was still in the room, but only on a technicality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he left?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe turned on the TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does that when he needs to zone out about something or unwind, so I let him be,\u201d Shayna said. \u201cI went to bed. Johnny Mack was already in his room. When I woke up at four this morning, he was gone.\u201d She grabbed my hand again. \u201cHis phone is off and I\u2019ve been looking for him since sunup. I didn\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d</p><p>I met her eyes and remembered her question when she\u2019d arrived.</p><p>\u201cYou thought he\u2019d come here.\u201d</p><p>Her puffy eyes blinked and looked down. \u201cI looked everywhere else first, but honestly I thought he\u2019d be here.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and looked at my door. \u201cIf he\u2019s feeling betrayed by women right now, I would be the last person he\u2019d want to talk to.\u201d I got up. \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna walk forever. It\u2019s chilly out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease help me look for him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShayna, I have to go to work. Ruthie can\u2019t run my store indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Which was a lie. She could run it better than I ever could and was probably doing twice the sales already. But I did need to actually make a full day. Something I hadn\u2019t done since Noah landed. And I would. Right after one little stop.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d I said, holding out a hand. \u201cWhen he wants to be found, he will be. I\u2019m sure he has some steam to work off.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>My thoughts were racing as I parked in front of the store. There was no reason to hide around the corner anymore. Hell, he was the one hiding now.</p><p>My head said to walk straight to my door, go in, do my job, give Ruthie a very deserved earful to catch her up, and wait on the sidelines to hear how Shayna and Noah\u2019s dilemma played out. That was my place, as her friend, as his friend, not to jump all up in the middle of things. It wasn\u2019t for me to worry over where he disappeared to in the middle of the night. Or what their fights were about. Or whether or not he was in pain and feeling like he\u2019d been sucker-punched in the gut. Again.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I let my steps veer down the sidewalk to the left and let the sound and smells envelope me as I entered the diner. A quick glance around didn\u2019t produce Noah but did give me Linny.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said, approaching the counter as she went back behind it. \u201cIs Noah here?\u201d I asked quietly, my eyes automatically darting for signs of Johnny Mack. I knew from experience that he could be ready to pounce at any time, his recent mood improvement notwithstanding.</p><p>\u201cNo, and Dad\u2019s in the back, so relax,\u201d she said with a smirk. \u201cNever seen him so happy, though. That Seth is a godsend. Did you have a good day with him yesterday?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and for a second everything in me warmed. \u201cI did. He\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s better than all my dreams made him out to be.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes got a little misty. \u201cI\u2019m so glad. Noah seemed happy, too. I think he really needed this.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him this morning?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Linny blinked and shook her head, narrowing her eyes a bit. \u201cYou okay, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m good,\u201d I said. Probably a little too enthusiastically.</p><p>Linny put down a stack of menus she was carrying. \u201cJules, I know all this has had to be pretty crazy.\u201d Her eyes went soft in her round face. \u201cAnd by that, I don\u2019t just mean Seth.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I never really talked about it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed like you wanted it that way, so I guess over the years\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt got easier to just pretend,\u201d I said. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a couple of stupid women we were,\u201d she said.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. We need to remedy that.\u201d</p><p>Linny tilted her head. \u201cSo in the spirit of that, how are you, now that the prodigal son has returned?\u201d</p><p>There was that feeling again. Like an invisible vacuum was sucking the air from my lungs. All I could do was smile and hope it was believable.</p><p>\u201cEvery day is a new day.\u201d</p><p>Linny chuckled. \u201cIf I see my moody brother, I\u2019ll tell him you were looking for him\u2014or no?\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to say yes, then closed it. \u201cJust tell him to go home,\u201d I said. \u201cShayna is looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Go to work. Those were the words I had for myself as I walked back outside. Where it started to drizzle. Just walk, I told myself. It\u2019s right there\u2014the door is right there. Ruthie will be so proud.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t my business to worry about Noah. To think about his feelings or how hurt and angry he might be. We had an arrangement. Or I did.</p><p>And this is the thought that steeled me as I walked. Right off the curb, across the street, past the gazebo, and onto the path leading into the park. Where I knew with almost absolute certainty, if he was still in town and hadn\u2019t hitched a ride back to Italy, that he would be.</p><p>The drizzle upped to a really steady sprinkle, and I cursed as I wrapped my jacket tighter and apologized to my hair. At least I\u2019d had the good sense to wear jeans and loafers, but too much more wetness and I\u2019d be jonesing for my boots. Not to mention an umbrella.</p><p>And then there he was.</p><p>I recalled Noah\u2019s first day back in town when I\u2019d come upon this very same sight. Him sitting on our bench, staring off in the distance and lost in his own thoughts. I\u2019d been paralyzed with shock and flashbacks and had crept away like a mouse.</p><p>Amazing what could change in a week.</p><p>I slowed as I approached him, watching the droplets soak into the wood of the bench while they rolled off his leather jacket. That was fitting and matched his stony expression. Nothing reaching him. Nothing touching him. And my heart twisted in my chest. I wanted to cradle him in my arms and take the hurt away. Show him how to feel again.</p><p>Problem was, some of that hurt was on me. Shayna had just reactivated it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move when I sat beside him, and I realized it was exactly how we\u2019d sat many years earlier. On another rainy day. I felt my phone buzz in my jacket pocket, but it could wait.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not good company right now, Jules,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, good thing I didn\u2019t come here to hang out then, huh?\u201d His hand moved over his face and then his hair. \u201cShayna\u2019s looking for you. Been out here all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just\u2014landed here eventually.\u201d He let out a heavy sigh. \u201cThis is where things used to make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The silence felt loud as we watched the rain hit the water in front of us. How many times had we sat there just like that in our younger years? It was a happy place then.</p><p>I chanced a look at his profile, and he\u2019d gone hard again. He hadn\u2019t shaved and it made him look tired and fierce at the same time. Walls and chains went up and made his eyes cold blue stones in a face locked down tight. Untouchable and unbreakable. I had a feeling he\u2019d made good use of that in his career.</p><p>The wet cold was doing a job on me, I could feel the shivers coming on and I pulled my jacket tighter.</p><p>\u201cYou should go, Jules, it\u2019s cold,\u201d he said, his voice tired.</p><p>\u201cComing with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m good,\u201d I said. I had no clue what I was doing, but suddenly I knew I wasn\u2019t leaving him.</p><p>He sighed and wiped rain from his face. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t involve you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Yeah, that kind of stung and gave me a twitch, but I shook it off with the raindrops. \u201cDoesn\u2019t really matter what it involves, does it? I\u2019m here supporting a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou here to plead Shayna\u2019s case?\u201d he said, still staring ahead.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cNo. But she wasn\u2019t an evil troll in this either. Her heart was in the right place. She wanted to raise this child with you.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI have to figure out what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d His voice was toneless, emotionless.</p><p>\u201cAs in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in what the hell am I doing here?\u201d he said. \u201cI was an idiot for coming back to Copper Falls. I swore I never would.\u201d</p><p>There was that twitch again. \u201cGood to see this doesn\u2019t involve me,\u201d I said, unable to keep the snark out of my voice.</p><p>He inhaled slowly through his nose, as if trying to maintain control. \u201cI told you I wasn\u2019t good company right now,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say the right things, so please just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo. Yeah, I know,\u201d I said. \u201cI heard you. I don\u2019t care.\u201d My phone went off again but I ignored it.</p><p>He shot me a sideways look, but at least it was a look. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he said, defeat in his tone.</p><p>\u201cLook, I know this sucks, and I know it probably brings it all back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it does,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen talk to me, damn it!\u201d I yelled. \u201cYou said things made sense here. Then make sense of it. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to talk. I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, this is model behavior for fine,\u201d I said. \u201cSitting out in the cold rain glaring at the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d he shot back.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>The words drifted across my brain in neon purple and red letters before I could even register them and argue. Oh, no. No, no, no. My skin lit up with a million tiny fires. No, I couldn\u2019t go there, but I had. And he saw it.</p><p>The look he gave me hit me to the core, pinning me down. I couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t look away, was stuck there helplessly with rain bouncing off my nose and my mouth working and no sound coming out. I tried to suck back the emotion, to do his glaze-over trick, but it wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Then he did the miraculous. He blinked and looked away, releasing me from the spell, but also looking thrown and off balance. And slightly less robotic. Dear God, I\u2019d found the switch. But at what cost.</p><p>His jaw muscles worked double time, and he probably wanted to snap my neck, but at least he looked more human as he did it. I realized that I was most likely far outside my element, but what the hell. Breaking rules and boundaries\u2014wasn\u2019t that what everyone was always after me to do?</p><p>\u201cMy first instinct was to get on the next plane back to Italy,\u201d he said finally. My stomach burned at the words, but I kept my mouth shut. \u201cBack to the life I know. Or to make some calls\u2014I could have any government job I wanted. Anywhere.\u201d He rubbed at his eyes. \u201cAnd anywhere would be easier than here.\u201d</p><p>My chest felt like a gorilla took residence there. \u201cSo, you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>Noah shook his head minutely. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. All I know right now is that the last time I was and will ever be a father, I was sitting on this bench. All three of us were here.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned the backs of my eyes, but it didn\u2019t matter anymore. They\u2019d just mix with the rain.</p><p>He looked at me. \u201cThat\u2019s why you painted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the time, it was just a way to preserve something my mother couldn\u2019t take away,\u201d I said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know about this.\u201d My chin trembled. \u201cThis was ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be for me,\u201d he said, more to himself than to me. \u201cThe only shot I had is a grown man now\u2014\u201d</p><p>I got up and knelt in front of him, raking my wet hair back and leaning on his knees. It was physical and a risky gamble, but one he\u2019d taken when I was crumbling out behind a bar.</p><p>\u201cAnd that grown man is still your son,\u201d I said. \u201cYou are his father. Maybe you don\u2019t ever get the child part of the deal, but you get to know him.\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a miracle.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd whether you want to hear it or not,\u201d I continued. \u201cSomeone raised our son and loved him. You could do the same for this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not,\u201d I said. \u201cI know you feel betrayed, but\u2014\u201d I pictured the words like on a chalkboard. Just read it, Jules. \u201cYou have a woman who loves you, who\u2019s willing to follow you to the ends of the earth just to be with you. Crazy town, crazy father-in-law, secret children and ex-girlfriends all lurking everywhere.\u201d</p><p>I finished with a smirk, trying to lighten things up, but the smolder in his eyes as he leaned forward only made my skin heat up. On the upside, he was looking at me. Fully looking at me.</p><p>On the downside, he was fully looking at me.</p><p>\u201cYour ex is still in love with you, too,\u201d he said, his face only inches from mine. \u201cThat enough for you?\u201d</p><p>As all my breath left me, I was wishing for that glaze-over to come back. Maybe it wasn\u2019t so bad. Definitely had a purpose. My phone buzzed for a third time. Someone really wanted me, something might be on fire somewhere, but I let it go.</p><p>Closing his eyes as if completely worn out, he leaned his forehead against mine. Every nerve ending in my body came to attention, and I could hear my breathing, feel my blood move.</p><p>\u201cFeel that, Jules?\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat rush? That draw? The electricity?\u201d</p><p>What I felt was the breath from his words on my lips, and my extremities going numb as thunder rumbled in the distance. Protecting the heart again. Oh, if only something could.</p><p>\u201cElectricity is dangerous,\u201d I whispered, even as my lips moved upward all on their own. I couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>\u201cJules,\u201d he breathed against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said against his.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Heat burned my eyes as his mouth claimed mine, hungry, taking, pulling all he could from me as fast as I could give it. My body flipped on switches everywhere as the taste of him filled my senses again. Rain pounded harder, soaking us to the skin, but all I could feel were his hands fisting in my hair and the feel of his neck and face and head under my fingers. His whiskers were rough and scraping, but I pulled him in closer, tighter, needing to give as much as he needed to take.</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled louder, closer. Thoughts flashed with it. We couldn\u2019t do this. We couldn\u2019t do this. He wasn\u2019t free. And he might run again. And yet those words in my head had been real, and he\u2019d seen it and they were there, reeling me in. My need for him balled up in my belly like a fireball, pushing its way up until I was trembling with it. Shaking as I held him and made love to his mouth, kissing him with all the passion I had, trying to give him the love I couldn\u2019t say out loud.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just me. As another round of thunder crashed around us, I realized he was shaky too. He pulled away from me with hot angry tears in his eyes and a growl in his throat.</p><p>\u201cFuck, how do you do this to me, Jules?\u201d he said, angry frustration making his voice husky. \u201cI don\u2019t break like this. How do you always break me?\u201d</p><p>I took his face in my hands again before I lost the ground I\u2019d gained. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you less, Noah,\u201d I said, my voice trembling, my eyes burning. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to hurt, to feel, to be angry. At me, at Shayna, your dad, my mom\u2014whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting mad doesn\u2019t solve anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it does!\u201d I said. \u201cIt lets it out and makes you feel a hell of a lot better, and it\u2019s better than run\u2014\u201d I stopped myself, knowing it could go very south very quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s better than leaving.\u201d</p><p>Even the wind blowing the rain sideways into our faces didn\u2019t hide the deep-rooted stare he gave me.</p><p>\u201cYou were going to say running.\u201d</p><p>Damn special ops people picked up on everything. \u201cWhatever fits, babe,\u201d I whispered. \u201cBut you have to figure out what\u2019s right for you.\u201d Damn it, his mouth was right there and I had the overwhelming urge to kiss him again. Before I\u2019d never get to again. I dragged my gaze to his eyes instead, which wasn\u2019t much better. \u201cJust do me a favor,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard against the words I couldn\u2019t ignore. \u201cDon\u2019t leave without saying good-bye this time.\u201d</p><p>He looked like I\u2019d just punched his dog. My phone buzzed again, and I grabbed it for something to do so I could look away before I started to cry again. I hunched over it to protect it from the downpour, and saw it was Hayden. Great. At least he didn\u2019t have his own ringtone. The other missed calls were from him as well, which put my nerves on alert.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d I said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t call me unless\u2014Hello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Hayden demanded through the phone.</p><p>I flinched as if he\u2019d yelled in my face. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>Noah started to pull his hand away from mine, and I grabbed it, meeting his eyes. I didn\u2019t want to let go. To lose that contact. It was as if he\u2019d teleport back to some other part of the world if I did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the bookstore, where are you?\u201d Hayden said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014nearby,\u201d I said. Across the street in the park, in the rain, making out with Noah. \u201cWhy are you at the store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo find you because you wouldn\u2019t answer your phone,\u201d he said. \u201cIs there a reason Becca\u2019s out of school today? Exam exemptions or something?\u201d</p><p>Doom that reminded me of my real life settled into my skin. Real life that didn\u2019t include romance or man drama or old flames, but was more centered on homework and bad plumbing and utility bills. And Becca skipping school.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause I just saw her on the back of a motorcycle with some guy going down the highway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit.</p><p>In the few minutes it took Noah and me to make it to the store, Seth arrived there as well. He took one look at our faces as we jogged across the street to get under the awning, teeth chattering and my face probably raw, and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Glorious.</p><p>I yanked open the door to blessed warmth and some rather unblessed looks from Hayden. Ruthie was mouthing an I\u2019m sorry in the background, and his prepared words died on his lips when his eyes landed on Noah. They narrowed back on me. On us. And our disheveled, drowned rat appearance.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBecca?\u201d I said, refocusing him.</p><p>Hayden blinked that particular irritation free and picked the more relevant one.</p><p>\u201cI was headed to Katyville, just before the sky opened up, and what should pass me but a motorcycle going ninety-to-nothing. My first thought was well, they\u2019re trying to beat the rain. My second thought was oh, hey, look, there\u2019s Becca\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo helmet,\u201d I said, like that was the biggest issue.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it was her?\u201d I asked, although with her history I didn\u2019t really question it. I blew on my frozen fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to follow but they exited on Cayman Boulevard and I lost them. Been calling you ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules,\u201d Ruthie said, her face wary, her eyes darting to Hayden. \u201cCayman is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what Cayman is,\u201d Hayden said, wheeling around. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t be a prick, Hayden,\u201d I said, my teeth chattering harder and my whole body shaking at that point. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to help.\u201d</p> <p>He closed his eyes for a second to pull it together, and I knew it was hard. Noah\u2019s presence wasn\u2019t helping. Knowing that his daughter just went to an infamous part of town known locally as Sin Alley was enough. Cayman Boulevard was lined with seedy motels that generally charged by the hour. I was pretty nauseous over it myself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he echoed, turning to Ruthie. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, peeling my soaked jacket off.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Jules,\u201d Hayden said, coming forward and rubbing my arms. \u201cYou\u2019re like gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I said, catching his hands, too aware of Noah standing there. Which was crazy since he had a woman at home waiting on him. Kind of. \u201cWhat do we do? Drive up and down Cayman till we see the bike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise,\u201d Noah said, having miraculously controlled his own reaction to the cold. He wasn\u2019t even shaking anymore. I didn\u2019t know how, but then again he had been trained to be Superman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, were you consulted?\u201d Hayden asked.</p><p>\u201cHayden\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t Hayden me, Jules,\u201d he said, an edge curving his words up at the ends, a tell that meant he was at a breaking point.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d Noah continued, his voice even and calm. \u201cTo think back.\u201d His eyes bored into me. \u201cYou were her age. We were. How would it have gone down if your mother had walked in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Hayden said. \u201cMaybe she wouldn\u2019t have gotten pregnant at seventeen with a bastard child she\u2019d mourn for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHayden!\u201d I yelled, my eyes going directly to Seth, who was trying to stop Noah.</p><p>Noah was quick, crossing the few feet to Hayden in seconds, backing him up to the counter. Seth had a hand on his shoulder, but he wasn\u2019t budging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had about enough of you,\u201d Noah said through his teeth. \u201cWe are trying to help here, and you really need to help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoah, it\u2019s all right, really,\u201d Seth was saying. Not that either of them heard him.</p><p>Hayden was too pissed off to be cowed down this time, however. He bowed up and shoved Noah\u2019s hands away, looking him eye to eye. My stomach plummeted, knowing that the timing was bad for both of them.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna put my head on a table again?\u201d Hayden seethed. \u201cGo ahead. Give it a shot.\u201d Every muscle in his face and body twitched. \u201cYou may very well succeed. You might kick my ass. But I\u2019m stone-cold sober this time and I will take you down with me.\u201d</p><p>It was too much.</p><p>I could see the pain in Hayden\u2019s eyes, and it wasn\u2019t just about me or Noah or his pride this time. His baby girl was out there and he felt helpless.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I said. To the room. To either one of them that would hear me.</p><p>Noah was the one to finally back up, and Hayden followed suit. As Noah turned, his eyes met mine for that second, and I knew he\u2019d given Hayden that. It was a gift to a man hurting over his kid.</p><p>Deep breaths went all around, and then Seth, who had been watching quietly, said, \u201cI have her cell number.\u201d</p><p>Hayden turned to him and narrowed his eyes in question. \u201cAnd who might you be?\u201d</p><p>Seth offered a hand. \u201cBastard child. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Hayden stared at him as he slowly moved to shake his hand, and his face fell. He looked back at me and then to where Noah stood looking spring-loaded. Mortification draped over him like a blanket.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck me,\u201d he said under his breath.</p><p>He sank into a nearby chair and leaned his elbows on his knees, all the hot air knocked from him. He looked defeated and deflated and sad, and it squeezed my heart. I knelt at his feet, and the irony of that being the second time within the hour was not lost on me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jules,\u201d he said softly, staring at the floor. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>I pulled his head to me in a hug and just held on. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p><p>I looked up and saw Seth calling someone and Noah raking fingers through his wet hair to dry it. He had his own demons. Lord, they seemed to be running amok lately.</p><p>\u201cNoah, you need to go home,\u201d I said softly.</p><p>He looked down at me comforting Hayden, with so many words spilling from his eyes. I couldn\u2019t read any of them, so I tried to give him some of my own. Please don\u2019t leave town.</p><p>\u201cI just tracked the GPS on her phone,\u201d Seth said, walking back. \u201cI can go straight to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t have that on her phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d he said with a wink. \u201cI have magic powers.\u201d</p><p>Hayden stood up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a police detective,\u201d I said, pride oozing from my voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God,\u201d Hayden said. He grabbed Seth\u2019s hand again. \u201cMan, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I didn\u2019t\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all good,\u201d Seth said. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it.\u201d He turned to me, all business again. \u201cShe\u2019s not a criminal here, and both being minors, neither is he.\u201d He paused and studied my eyes as if weighing his words. \u201cThey are two kids doing what . . . two kids do. You can go barging in there and scar yourself and her forever, or I can go make sure she\u2019s safe and just wait and bring her home.\u201d</p><p>Hayden turned and paced the room, but I knew Seth was right. I couldn\u2019t control this one.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered, going to him with a hug that needed to fill twenty-six years.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ruthie sat across from me in the biggest chair we had, crossing her legs under her, which made her look dwarfed. For once, I was glad of a slow day and no customers. The quiet and simplicity of rain hitting the roof was soothing.</p><p>Hayden left to run work errands but was staying in town and told me four times to call him as soon as I heard something. Noah had left when Seth did, giving me a last look as he went through the door. A look I couldn\u2019t read and refused to agonize over. I had other teeth in my pond right now.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPick a category,\u201d I said, rubbing my temples. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d long for a simple Johnny Mack drama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that does seem like ages ago, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Ruthie said. She paused, and I knew where she was going. \u201cTell me about Noah.\u201d</p><p>I felt the stab to my heart and the strength ebb out of my bones. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, last I heard\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that was a mistake,\u201d I said, remembering the summary I\u2019d given her and not wanting to revisit it. I didn\u2019t even want to revisit the last hour. That was torturing me enough.</p><p>\u201cAnd so what was today?\u201d she asked, eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cShayna\u2014oh, crap, that\u2019s right,\u201d I said, leaning forward. \u201cYou don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no, I don\u2019t know!\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m in the Land of the Lost over here.\u201d</p><p>I held up my hands in surrender. \u201cThe baby isn\u2019t Noah\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>I relayed the Shayna visit with all the details I could.</p><p>\u201cHoly hell,\u201d she said when I was done, putting her hands over her face. \u201cEven I feel sorry for him on that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the romp in the rain?\u201d she said, gesturing to the door. \u201cThat was\u2014what?\u201d</p><p>I paused. Good intentions. \u201cMe finding him in the park,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBecause that was your obligation?\u201d</p><p>I huffed out a breath. \u201cNo, Nana Mae, that was me looking to help a friend who was hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy falling into his mouth.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her. \u201cSo\u2014my daughter\u2019s having sex right now.\u201d</p><p>She paused and raised her eyebrows as she looked down. \u201cBetter subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrighteningly so,\u201d I said, closing my eyes. \u201cI just hate sitting here waiting. I need ice cream and a blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, desperate measures,\u201d she said, then winked and shook her head. \u201cJules, she\u2019ll be fine. Seth will find her. He\u2019s amazing, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Warmth spread through me at the mention of his name. He was amazing. Not that I had anything to do with it. His adoptive mother deserved the credit for how she raised him. The child I raised was currently shacking up in a hotel and ditching school.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is,\u201d I said. \u201cFunny, smart, introspective. He\u2019s so much like Noah, it\u2019s eerie.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie hung her head. \u201cAnd all roads continue to lead back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuthie, quit,\u201d I said. \u201cPlease. This thing you have against Noah is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs completely justified,\u201d she said. \u201cOr do you not remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been just as badgered by his dad for a choice I made at seventeen, Ruthie,\u201d I said. \u201cI chose to let my mom railroad me. He chose to leave. We both made mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie chewed her bottom lip. \u201cI watched you go through twelve kinds of hell, Jules. And you were never the same again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t all on Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Jules, do you hear yourself?\u201d she said, swinging her legs down. \u201cYou will defend him to the hilt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat has he done so wrong?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She widened her eyes. \u201cUh, I don\u2019t know, ask Shayna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman who lied to him.\u201d Which I realized was exactly the opposite tack I\u2019d taken with Noah, but my fence was dissolving.</p><p>\u201cWho he evidently almost cheated on if you almost slept with him,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he\u2019s no angel in this.\u201d</p><p>I covered my face with my hands, knowing there was some merit to her words and not wanting to hear any of it. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand,\u201d she said. \u201cJules, you are one of the strongest women I know. No one gets through that wall you have. Except Noah Ryan. He is like fucking kryptonite. You completely lose all sense of yourself around him.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie got up and knelt in front of me. \u201cSweetheart, you are my best friend and I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know what Noah means to you. What he has always meant,\u201d she said, squeezing my hands. \u201cBut he is dangerous when it comes to you. Neither of you have any control. And I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt again.\u201d</p><p>There were tears in her eyes, and that broke my heart. She was wrong. I wasn\u2019t the strong one, she was. She might look like a waif, but she was a Viking in disguise.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, taking a slow breath in. \u201cBut Ruthie, you\u2019ve got to trust me on this. And I know my history with him doesn\u2019t warrant that,\u201d I added when her expression changed. But we\u2019re adults now, and we\u2019ve both come to terms with how we got here. He\u2019s not the bad guy anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has someone,\u201d she said without blinking.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYes, he does, and I have no idea what he\u2019s going to do with that. He\u2019s messed up right now and conflicted. They were breaking up when she got pregnant, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>She scoffed. \u201cHe told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie started. \u201cThat\u2019s twisted, her talking to you about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m all she has here,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich is getting exhausting.\u201d I squeezed her hands again to refocus. \u201cAnyway\u2014there are other issues in the fire, too. He has job options that he might take, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going down with Shayna yet\u2014and I\u2019m not part of the equation.\u201d Ruthie gave me a skeptical look. \u201cSeriously,\u201d I said. \u201cI told him to figure things out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cSo quit with the kryptonite and trust me.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie chuckled. \u201cAnd if he leaves again?\u201d</p><p>My heart will shrivel into a prune. \u201cThen he leaves again.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Four hours later, I was useless.</p><p>I checked my phone for the sixty-seventh time, cursing myself for not getting Seth\u2019s number. No answer from Becca on my nine texts and thirteen unanswered calls. All I had was eight texts from Hayden, the one person I did not need to hear from.</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape me how much I wanted to see or hear from Noah. We\u2019d never exchanged numbers, so there wouldn\u2019t be anything from him, but I was craving it. Crap, Ruthie was right. I was a hopeless twit when it came to him.</p><p>Unable to stand the menial tasks of the day any longer, I told Ruthie I was going for a walk\u2014in the rain, which she knew was bunk but just nodded. And I went next door. Not that there would be anything soothing there, but I needed the distraction.</p><p>Wondering what went down with Becca had my stomach churning. Wondering what went down with Noah and Shayna\u2014well, Ruthie was right in one respect. That wasn\u2019t my business.</p><p>I pulled open the door, oblivious to the delicious aroma of what the chalkboard specials said was gumbo, and wandered in slowly. What was I doing there? Linny spied me and headed my way with a wink.</p><p>\u201cYou meeting them?\u201d she asked, gesturing with a tilt of her head. \u201cThey\u2019re over in the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cBecca and Seth,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you a menu if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered, heading their way and waving a hand back at Linny to let her know I wasn\u2019t cursing at her.</p><p>There they were, languishing in the far corner booth, and my steps faltered as I watched them together. My kids. My beautiful babies, laughing at something, unaware I was watching. Looking like they\u2019d grown up together. If I could have stopped time and taken a picture of the moment, I would have.</p><p>Seth looked up, however, and the moment passed. He nodded and I approached slowly, taking measured breaths as I slid into the seat next to Becca.</p><p>Her expression went from open to closed in a split second. Glorious.</p><p>\u201cHey, Bec,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t start,\u201d she said, making my hackles go up immediately.</p><p>Seth sat back and shook his head. \u201cDude, who was in the wrong here?\u201d he said. \u201cI told you, suck it up and own it. It goes better.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and inhaled slowly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, eyes still shut as if she\u2019d found some Zen place.</p><p>I glanced at Seth, who sat there like an instructor, arms crossed, waiting to see what she would do.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSkipping school again,\u201d she said softly and took another breath. \u201cTo be with Mark.\u201d</p><p>I was going to throw up. Right there in the basket of chips. I grabbed a cardboard coaster and mangled it instead.</p><p>\u201cBecca, you\u2014went way beyond that today. Not to mention ignoring my texts and calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Mom,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just\u2014I had a lot on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I can imagine you did,\u201d I said, grabbing a chip and breaking tiny pieces off. \u201cDid Seth mention who saw you?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward on the table. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know how fun that was?\u201d</p><p>Seth rested his hands on the table and pushed back. \u201cLadies, I\u2019m gonna let you two talk,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get on the road home in about an hour, and I have some people to see first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d Becca said, frowning.</p><p>He reached across and bumped fists with her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work something out. I\u2019ll come visit, you can come visit, whatever. We\u2019ll keep in touch.\u201d He smiled crookedly, sending me down the Noah Express again. Ruthie would slap me. \u201cI\u2019ve got a little sister now, with lopsided hair. I have to keep up with that.\u201d</p><p>Becca smiled and took out her phone. \u201cSelfie before you go\u2014come on,\u201d she said, nudging me out with her elbow.</p><p>I moved before I was pushed out on my ass, and she slid next to Seth so they could put their heads together for the picture. He nodded toward me as they stood. \u201cTake one of us, Becca,\u201d he said, looping an arm around my shoulders. I knew quite well what I looked like after the rain escapade and my hair drying on its own, but I didn\u2019t care. I hugged his waist and smiled. I had a hundred pictures of him with other people. Now we\u2019d have two at least that would mean something. And the one with him and Noah that I hadn\u2019t looked at yet. Didn\u2019t let myself the night before, and for sure I couldn\u2019t now. Not after\u2014all that.</p><p>\u201cYou have my number, Bec,\u201d he said, hugging her tightly. \u201cSend those to me before you get your phone taken away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said, hugging him hard.</p><p>\u201cAnd use that number. I\u2019m expecting it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d she said, her voice a little wobbly. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to me, reluctantly, as if he didn\u2019t know how to do this. I didn\u2019t either. But when we locked eyes, I was shocked to see genuine emotion in his.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said, grabbing my hand.</p><p>\u201cThank me?\u201d I said, surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything, baby. You were the brave one coming here. And doing this today? God, Seth, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you made it easy,\u201d he said, shaking his head slightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I would find here, and you made it all\u2014okay.\u201d His eyes misted. \u201cI honestly feel like I have another family in my life now, and I didn\u2019t expect that.\u201d</p><p>Oh, holy hell, that did me in. Tears filled my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you feel that way,\u201d I said. I smiled up at him and laughed as they spilled over onto my cheeks. \u201cI know, I know, I\u2019m a walking waterfall.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and hugged me so tight, it was all I could do not to completely break down. I was holding my son. My son, the man. When we pulled back, he swiped at his own face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound condescending or go all parental on you,\u201d I said. \u201cBut, Seth, I am so proud of the man you\u2019ve become.\u201d My voice choked on the new tears that wouldn\u2019t be denied. Especially when his face struggled to hold his in. \u201cYou tell your mom and dad\u2014thank you for me,\u201d I said. \u201cFor being such fantastic parents.\u201d</p><p>My voice caught on the words. I heard Becca sniffle behind me, and Seth lost the fight. He blinked tears free from reddened eyes and nodded as he wiped them away quickly.</p><p>\u201cDamn, you two can even make me cry,\u201d he said on a laugh, and Becca laughed with him, going to hug him again. \u201cNot many people can break me like that.\u201d</p><p>The words sent goose bumps down my back, echoing Noah\u2019s from that very morning.</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to go say some other good-byes and go by Nana Mae\u2019s and Noah\u2019s, still,\u201d he said, making another pass at his face. Crying was embarrassing him. I\u2019d become accustomed to it.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014um\u2014something to be aware of there,\u201d I said. I filled him in quickly on the whole Noah-Shayna-baby debacle so he didn\u2019t say anything awkward.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d he said, scrubbing hands through his hair. \u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes and darted a glance toward Becca, then me. \u201cSo\u2014I don\u2019t want to sound condescending and go all know-it-all on you,\u201d he began, making me laugh, \u201cBut you and Noah\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, seriously?\u201d Becca said, contorting her face.</p><p>\u201cGo check your Facebook while you can,\u201d I said, giving her a way out of the ick factor. She took the out, dropping back into her seat.</p><p>Seth chuckled and then met my eyes again. \u201cI\u2019ve only known you and Noah for less than two days now, and I can see it.\u201d</p><p>I averted my gaze to the floor. \u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s just complicated.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been told that sometimes the harder, complicated relationships that you have to fight for are the ones worth something,\u201d he said, bringing my gaze back up. He had a small grin on his face as he held his palms up. \u201cOr something to that effect. But hey, not my business. I can go check my Facebook too.\u201d</p><p>I grinned through my tears. \u201cPoint taken. Can we talk about your love life now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaving,\u201d he said, backing up.</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cWhat I thought.\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward again quickly with a glance toward Becca, leaning over in my ear. \u201cShe didn\u2019t do the deed, by the way. Listen to her. Let her talk.\u201d</p><p>I widened my eyes as he backed up, smiled, said another good-bye to Becca and headed for the kitchen to see Linny and Johnny Mack. Watching him walk away pulled at my insides, tearing at me as if he were an infant all over again. I clamped a hand over my mouth to hold it in, and then I felt an arm through mine. Turning, I met Becca\u2019s eyes, full of tears too. I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her like there was no tomorrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After texting Hayden that Becca was back safe and sound, and asking-slash-begging him not to come confront her just yet, she and I went back to the bookstore. Ruthie made hot chocolate\u2014the real kind, not powder from a packet\u2014and left us alone in a far corner couch.</p><p>She was softer, I noticed. More introspective. Seth was good for her.</p><p>\u201cSo is this store going to me one day?\u201d Becca asked after a long moment when neither of us knew where to begin.</p><p>She\u2019d never asked me that before, and honestly it had never crossed my mind. Odd, that.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want it to?\u201d I asked. Becca looked at me uncomfortably and shrugged. \u201cNo, seriously,\u201d I said. \u201cBe honest with me.\u201d</p><p>She took another sip and licked her lips. \u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it just isn\u2019t something I can ever see myself doing. Sitting in a bookstore reading? Yes. Running one?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>Boy, I knew that feeling, and it gave me the willies all the way to my toes.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not upset?\u201d she said.</p> <p>Not about that. \u201cNot at all,\u201d I said. \u201cYou should do what you want. I wasn\u2019t given that choice.\u201d Echoes, echoes, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</p><p>She gave me a long look. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a teacher, either, Mom.\u201d</p><p>I took a slow swallow from my mug. \u201cI kind of picked that up. So what do you want to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d she said, looking down into her cup.</p><p>I let some moments pass. \u201cTell me about today.\u201d</p><p>Becca grimaced. \u201cCan we just pretend I went shopping or something?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>I raised an eyebrow. \u201cSure. How was the shopping on Cayman Boulevard?\u201d</p><p>She chuckled and looked away, probably surprised that I played. I was surprised that I played. Not my normal way. Maybe Seth was good for me, too.</p><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy anything.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps. I looked at her. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWasn\u2019t ready to, I guess. Decided to save my money for\u2014something worth spending it on. Maybe wait for something I can\u2019t live without,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>I had no words to describe how that floored me. All I could do was stare at her in awe. She\u2019d made her own choice. Made her own rule for herself. Her own rule.</p><p>Granted, she\u2019d skipped school and snuck off to do it, but I had to recognize the hugeness of what she had done.</p><p>\u201cI think that was a brilliant decision,\u201d I said when I found my tongue.</p> <p>Becca met my gaze. \u201cAnd if I\u2019d went the other way?\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cWell, I guess I wouldn\u2019t be able to say much, would I?\u201d</p><p>Memory clouded her expression. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that about Seth\u2014about you\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I touched her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, babe. There was truth in it. It\u2019s a hard truth for a parent to justify, is all.\u201d She nodded and ran a finger around the rim of her half-empty mug. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of you, Bec,\u201d I said, feeling the burn behind my eyes. I swear I was going to dehydrate. \u201cThat was a very grown-up decision you made.\u201d</p><p>She looked up and misted over as she smiled. \u201cGrown-up enough to not get punished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYeah, it was worth a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was, but the playing hooky part of your day takes the grown-up part down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She covered her face. \u201cGod, what does Dad know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d I said. \u201cYou need to talk to him like this. He deserves it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Seth said.\u201d</p><p>I turned sideways to face her. \u201cHow did all this go down with Seth?\u201d</p><p>Becca swept her hair back and it fell in its little choppy layers.</p><p>\u201cHe was sitting on the hood of his truck all badass right outside the door of the\u2014\u201d She stopped and gave me a sideways glance. \u201cThe mall.\u201d</p><p>It was all I could do not to spit hot chocolate. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMark about pissed himself,\u201d she said. \u201cThen Seth told him he could leave, that he\u2019d take me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just said, Okay, see ya, Mark?\u201d I asked, incredulous.</p><p>If Hayden or I would have done that, there would have been sounds only dogs could hear. Seth was right.</p><p>She held up a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess I was so embarrassed that he was sitting there waiting on me, it didn\u2019t even cross my mind to argue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed at her face. \u201cThen he brought me to St. Vernon\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She looked at me questioningly. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for teenage mothers that have nowhere to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I know,\u201d I said, my voice cracking. \u201cI\u2019ve been there.\u201d</p><p>Becca\u2019s expression changed as her thoughts took off. \u201cDid you\u2014have to go there?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBriefly,\u201d I said, my stomach going sour at the memory. \u201cMy parents thought a weekend there would change my mind about keeping him.\u201d</p><p>Becca\u2019s eyes filled. \u201cDid it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cSeth volunteers there once a month,\u201d Becca said. \u201cTalking to people who need it.\u201d She wiped away two tears. \u201cTakes on a whole new meaning now, when you know him,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish I could have grown up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have, baby,\u201d I said, swiping under my eyes. I\u2019d come to terms with that. \u201cIf Noah and I had stayed together and got to keep Seth, I wouldn\u2019t have met your dad and wouldn\u2019t have you now.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cEverything happens for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s messed up, Mom,\u201d she said, more tears falling.</p><p>\u201cLife generally is, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want messed-up crap like that,\u201d she said, hiccupping through her tears.</p><p>I laughed and hugged her head to me. My baby girl. \u201cI don\u2019t want messed-up crap for you either, baby. Let\u2019s hope for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>The next week went by in a haze of the normal things most people take for granted. I used to. It was hard to remember that. Just weeks earlier I\u2019d gotten up and gone to work every day, made sure Becca had what she needed, made sure our little world was in order, ate, slept, and did it all again the next day.</p><p>Things may not have been shiny, but they made sense.</p><p>Now, Becca and I were doing better, but it was taking large amounts of pretend patience on my part. Trying not to be my mother proved harder than I even wanted to acknowledge. And then there was that other thing.</p><p>That thing I kept trying to ignore or forget or at least not care about, when in reality some part of every hour seemed to ring a little Noah chime in my head.</p><p>Interestingly enough, where he\u2019d been friggin\u2019 everywhere before, now he and Shayna had both disappeared off the grid. Which probably didn\u2019t help my chiming. I had no idea what their status was, where they were, and there was no way in hell I was going to ask anyone. The closest I\u2019d come was chatting up Linny on the sidewalk one evening, and she talked about everything else but Noah. I know. I waited it out.</p><p>What I did have was photos. I\u2019d printed out the ones of me and Seth and of him and Becca, and framed them for the living room tables. Finally, I had both my kids there, without hiding or secrets. I could look at him every day. Twice, I attempted to do something with some of his baby pictures, but I couldn\u2019t do it. I was glad to have them, but they represented pain and betrayal to me. Of a time where my mother got to know of him but kept it all from me. So I put them all back in the book box, put the whole thing in a plastic tub to protect it, and set that back on the shelf. I could go there if I chose to, but I would rather look at the photos taken now, where everything was out in the open. There would be more. I\u2019d make sure of it.</p><p>There was another photo I still hadn\u2019t seen. But just knowing it was there was enough.</p><p>On Friday night, I decided to take Becca out for dinner before she headed off to spend the night with Lizzy and her family. They preferred that so that they could get an early start with the float the next morning. Good grief.</p><p>Of course, Becca picked the damn diner for our dinner out, which blew my mind. Of all the good places to go, she wanted the same crap we ate for lunch all the time. Or I did. And she did when she wasn\u2019t eating at school. Which was more frequent than she admitted.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to go there at night\u2014not that I was afraid of someone being there, but then again maybe I was. I was accustomed to the lunch crowd. He didn\u2019t show much for that, and I could relax. I had no idea who to expect for the dinner crowd. Geez, I had to move on.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t want to go get Mexican or Italian or something?\u201d I said as we pulled in front of the diner.</p><p>Little snowflakes frosted the glass, and red flyers were on a box outside the door. Red flyers were everywhere now. On every street post and every corner. On the far end of the park, the carnival rides were already set up, just waiting for the next day to kick things off. Just two more days of this, I told myself. Tomorrow would be chaos and crazy people on cheap floats, kids waiting for candy and carnival rides, and the chili battle would commence. The next day would be more of the same, but wrapping up at nightfall.</p><p>\u201cWe could even go to Katyville,\u201d I said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, I want to go here,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is home.\u201d</p><p>True, and I loved that, but home was kind of beating me with a stick lately.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said on a sigh, getting out of the car.</p><p>A quick perusal of the other parked cars didn\u2019t produce any heart palpitations, and I mentally kicked myself for feeling disappointed by that. Good Lord, I was losing it.</p><p>Linny was getting off as we walked in, and she met Becca with a giant hug.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get enough of this place already?\u201d she asked, laughing, her round face looking softer with her hair pulled down.</p><p>I realized I hardly ever saw her that way. Like her sole existence was in that diner. I gave a little shiver at that thought, hoping no one ever looked at me that way. Like I was a walking bookstore.</p><p>\u201cBecca\u2019s choice,\u201d I said, shrugging.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you get a discount,\u201d she said, winking as she walked out the door.</p><p>I frowned, confused. \u201cDiscount?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCounter tonight?\u201d Becca asked, her eyes all giddy.</p><p>Just kill me. \u201cHow about that booth right by the counter,\u201d I said, pointing. \u201cCompromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is with you tonight?\u201d I asked, studying her as we sat. \u201cYou\u2019re all, like, sparkly and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you have against sparkly?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d I said. \u201cExcept I\u2019m gonna check behind your ears for alien cloning when we get home. Somebody sucked the smart-ass out of you.\u201d</p><p>Becca laughed. \u201cNah, it\u2019s still there, I\u2019m just learning to channel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so much better,\u201d I said, sitting back in the seat. \u201cGood to know you\u2019re still in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d she said with her customary eye flutter.</p><p>A waitress I didn\u2019t know walked up, which was weird enough. Her nudging Becca with a grin upped the oddness. Her tag said Chloe, and she was easily twenty-five, so not a friend from school. And then I reminded myself that I didn\u2019t need to know everything and to back off the crazy train.</p><p>In honor of the night, I ordered something completely different. Becca\u2019s favorite, the shrimp po\u2019boy. With onion rings. And fried okra. And a Coke.</p><p>Her look of utter astonishment was so worth the saturated fat I was going to ingest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the same, with sweet potato fries,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAmen,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cCool, I\u2019ll put your discount in,\u201d Chloe said, walking away.</p><p>There was that word again. \u201cWhat discount?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Johnny Mack came out from the kitchen and pulled some plates from the hot tray, barking orders to Chloe and another girl I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Becca bit back a grin, and then laughed. \u201cI got a job.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t see that one coming.</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGot a job,\u201d she said, sitting up proudly. \u201cI start next week, on the night shift, and when summer comes I\u2019ll maybe get moved to days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d My head tried to put the words together. Not the job part. The working at the diner part. \u201cHere?\u201d I said. \u201cLike, here here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis very shift,\u201d she said.</p><p>I felt my face grimace. \u201cNeeded a challenge, did you?\u201d I glanced over at Johnny Mack, who did a double take on me, and then winked\u2014winked\u2014at Becca before griping about a plate that was wrong to someone behind him.</p><p>Becca snickered as I gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I said, the sentence falling out of my mouth before I could remember who was sitting with me. I clapped a hand over my mouth.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d she said, full-out laughing. \u201cSuch language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain,\u201d I mumbled behind my hand.</p><p>She shrugged, although her pleased expression was priceless. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been\u2014talking,\u201d I repeated, before the crazy bubbled up. Tired laughter worked its way out and I leaned my face into my hands. \u201cWow.\u201d To be a fly on that wall.</p><p>\u201cIs it okay? Me working here?\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because I wanted it to be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>Success. It was a surprise.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014yes, baby, it\u2019s fine,\u201d I said, chuckling and squeezing her hand. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014taken by surprise, is all.\u201d I looked over at Johnny Mack again with skepticism. \u201cEspecially on his end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d she said, rearranging the sweetener packets. \u201cHe\u2019s more noise than anything else.\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips, so many responses waiting to fly out, but I swallowed them back. My past with him didn\u2019t matter. She had her own path to make, and she didn\u2019t need my funk messing it up. Besides, maybe it was his way of moving forward, mending fences and all that. And if she could handle him\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, Bec,\u201d I said. \u201cOf who you are\u2014who you\u2019re becoming. The world\u2019s a crazy, mad place, and I think you\u2019re gonna be okay in it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Then lightbulbs went off in her eyes. \u201cThat can be my tattoo!\u201d</p><p>I blinked. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tattoo!\u201d she reiterated. \u201cThere\u2019s a line in Alice In Wonderland that the Mad Hatter says, \u2018We\u2019re all mad here . . .\u2019\u201d she said, holding up her wrist. \u201cThat would look awesome on my wrist.\u201d</p><p>Well, I had a few short seconds, anyway.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you thought any more about college?\u201d I said, phrasing my words carefully. Didn\u2019t want to come across as controlling, or planning her life, or rule-enforcing, or any of the other various crimes I\u2019d been labeled with.</p><p>Her eyebrows came together as she looked down at her silverware, studying them as if they held an answer to my question.</p><p>\u201cCompromise?\u201d she said, looking up.</p><p>Cute, I thought, playing on my words. But her eyes were serious for once, not defensive as they usually were on the subject. Steeling myself, I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and let it out slowly, which did nothing to reassure me.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I wait a year?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then decide.\u201d</p><p>The old reflexes and irritability over disarray and laziness started boiling under my skin. Wait for what, Becca? Why? So you can be a waitress? Ask Linny how much she enjoys a lifetime career of that.</p><p>That was just the kick-start of the comebacks tickling my tongue. There were more. And as I looked around to see where my Coke was so I could drown them, I found myself looking up at Noah. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Really, really, truly could have used that Coke just then, as my mouth turned into a sandbox. He was headed behind the counter and stopped cold when he saw me, shrugging out of his jacket and walking our way.</p><p>\u201cOh, crap,\u201d I muttered, not meaning it to be out loud, but that was my life.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Becca said. \u201cOhhhh . . .\u201d</p><p>A very particular kind of stabbing, wrenching, piercing pain sliced through my middle as his eyes met mine. They were freakishly blue in that light, and warm, and I had to look someplace else. Like at Becca, who was clearly watching me to see if I\u2019d disintegrate.</p> <p>\u201cLadies,\u201d he said, his expression jovial with a side of longing.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He looked positively friggin\u2019 edible in a long-sleeved button-down black dress shirt and black jeans. I didn\u2019t see his feet. I couldn\u2019t care less about his feet. I wondered if he was meeting Shayna for a night out. Maybe dancing. Maybe I\u2019d throw up, later.</p><p>\u201cHey, Noah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMr. Ryan,\u201d Becca said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d he said, rubbing his eyes. \u201cSee that ornery, crotchety old man over there? That\u2019s Mr. Ryan,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease\u2014Noah or Hey you will work just fine.\u201d</p><p>Becca laughed. \u201cOkay, Hey you, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Noah laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You\u2019re a joy, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the rumor,\u201d she said, snickering at her own wittiness.</p><p>I wanted to be witty. All I was was sweaty. His hand landed on my shoulder then, nearly sending me into sweaty orbit.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see if you still had that picture you took of me and Seth\u2014here at the diner?\u201d he said.</p> <p>The one I still couldn\u2019t look at? Sure. \u201cOf course,\u201d I said, fumbling with my phone.</p><p>Photos\u2014where were the photos? Nope, that wasn\u2019t it. Finally, I pulled them up and scrolled, hoping he didn\u2019t notice that my fingers were trembling. Jesus, this was ridiculous. A week without seeing him and I was right back to the blithering idiot I\u2019d been when he arrived in town.</p><p>My thumb froze on the photo in question, and my heart did a jump around in my chest. Their heads together, looking at me, so alike. And Noah\u2019s eyes\u2014shit.</p><p>\u201cHere you go,\u201d I said, handing it up to him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take the phone from me, he just put his hand over mine, holding it with me as he gazed upon the image and smiled.</p><p>Glaze over, I told myself. Don\u2019t show weakness. Don\u2019t show anything. Glaze, damn it. Glaze over, glaze over\u2014</p><p>\u201cGreat picture,\u201d he said. \u201cMind if I send it to myself?\u201d</p><p>I let go of the phone, letting him do his thing, fully aware that I\u2019d now have his number. And he would have mine. And now I could completely officially obsess over him never calling me.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Shayna take some too?\u201d I asked, bringing his eyes back to me like a wrecking ball.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but she left before I got them.\u201d</p><p>Everything in me went still.</p><p>\u201cShe left\u2014like\u2014on a trip?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOne-way trip,\u201d he said, typing in his number. He met my eyes again. \u201cShe\u2019s back in Virginia with her family.\u201d</p><p>He handed my phone back to me, and as much as I wanted to look away, I couldn\u2019t. I was stuck. What the hell did that mean, Shayna leaving? And when did this happen?</p><p>\u201cAre . . . you okay?\u201d I asked, clearing my throat.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI\u2019m fine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at Becca and patted her hand. \u201cA night with my girl. Never better.\u201d When I looked back up, there was a look of something that made my breath catch in my throat.</p><p>\u201cSo!\u201d Becca said, clasping her hands together. I jumped at the sound of her voice, breaking the gravity his gaze held me with. \u201cYou look nice, all duded out. Big night?\u201d</p><p>Bless you, Becca, for asking that.</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Noah said. \u201cLeaving to meet up with my old boss about a job.</p><p>That jerked my head around again and this time I searched his face for answers. For something. No tells, no clues. When he looked my way again, his eyes were clear.</p><p>The two seconds of hope I\u2019d felt at the news of Shayna\u2019s departure were stomped down and ground out. He was focused and clear and driven.</p><p>And ready to leave the place that always muddied that.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t meant to be. It never was. And that had to be okay. I nodded and smiled up at him.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Noah,\u201d I said.</p><p>There was a long pause and a look I couldn\u2019t read.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, with a small smile. \u201cYou two have a good night.\u201d</p><p>He walked away, leaving a gaping hole in his wake. And it was everything I could do to hold it together. I turned to face Becca, not quite able to look her in the eye. I couldn\u2019t. My eyes were burning, my chest was tight, and I looked around the room looking for a focal point. I clamped my jaws together as tight as I could to push it back.</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d I said, as the blessed Coke finally arrived and I drank down half of it before even finding the straw. Anything to cool my jets.</p><p>\u201cYou still love him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Her words, spoken soft and mature and knowing, as if she were twice her age, made me chuckle.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d I said.</p><p>She gave me a look. \u201cI thought we were being honest. I know what you look like when you\u2019re trying not to cry, Mom, so save it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, though it wasn\u2019t real. Opened my straw and stirred my ice.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess you are more perceptive than I\u2019m prepared to admit,\u201d I said.</p><p>Becca scoffed. \u201cNot really,\u201d she said. \u201cBut after Seth said that about you and Mr.\u2014Noah\u2014the other day, well, now it just seems crazy not to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter, Bec,\u201d I said. \u201cPeople can see all they want, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gonna work out that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it makes you sad.\u201d</p><p>I smiled slowly. \u201cTell me about this year-off idea you have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, subject change of the century,\u201d she said, taking a drink.</p><p>I widened my eyes at her. \u201cTake the moment, baby.\u201d</p><p>She inhaled and let it go. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m not talking about blowing it off, I just\u2014\u201d She stopped and looked at her hands for a minute. \u201cI\u2019d like to concentrate on my writing for a while without having to do school stuff, too.\u201d</p><p>I sat back. I hadn\u2019t expected an actual reason. \u201cYour writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, licking her lips and fidgeting with her napkin. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m any good at it, but I\u2019d like to find out. Maybe submit a story to a magazine or something. I did some research online and I have a\u2014list . . .\u201d Her voice trailed off as she looked up at me. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to settle for something else before giving it a shot, Mom.\u201d</p><p>The tears I\u2019d managed to put away came back for a second attempt. It was like sitting across the table from my mother years earlier, having a very similar conversation.</p><p>I\u2019d been accepted at a state school for the arts. It was four hours away and a chance to find my sanity again. But that wasn\u2019t practical or logical, and so the dream I\u2019d manufactured for years was shredded in a matter of seconds. I took business courses instead, to ready me for running the store.</p><p>I looked at my daughter\u2019s hopeful expression, my skin buzzing from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cTake the year,\u201d I said, my voice gone husky and foreign to me.</p><p>Becca blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, a rush of warmth spreading over me, making me stop and take a deep breath. \u201cTake the year, and do it seriously,\u201d I said. \u201cIf at that time you decide you want to go into creative writing or journalism or whatever, or something else entirely, then at least you can make an educated decision.\u201d</p><p>Becca\u2019s face was priceless. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The absolute relief and joy and hope in her tone made my heart heal a little, right there on the spot. For one second, I felt I\u2019d done something right.</p><p>\u201cNever settle, baby,\u201d I said, quickly whisking a rogue tear away. \u201cNever, ever settle.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes misted up, and the smile that grew as her mind started working on her newfound possibilities was refreshing.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do I get to read any of this stuff?\u201d I said.</p><p>Her smile grew even bigger although a little anxious. I recognized that anxiety. Once upon a time, no one saw my work until my signature was at the bottom and I\u2019d deemed it done. Even then, I\u2019d panic a little.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I have to work on some things, first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d I said.</p><p>Becca looked at me, leaning forward, a new energy in her eyes. \u201cYou know, there are some non-credit summer writing classes I heard about, that are just like a few weeks long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can work around that,\u201d she said, shrugging off what had been the biggest news of the night just thirty minutes before. \u201cWhat if you take some art classes, too?\u201d</p><p>I nearly spewed a mouthful of Coke.</p><p>\u201cOh, wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d she said. \u201cWe could be part-time students together.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, tickled at her sudden gusto. But would that just tease me back into something I didn\u2019t have time for? Then again, why the hell not.</p><p>\u201cGet me the info,\u201d I said. \u201cI might just take you up on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Our food came and I took that fried food down like it was my last meal. I looked at it as only the beginning of a heartburn-filled weekend. The chili cook-off guaranteed the rest.</p><p>Sitting back, fat and happy, I studied Becca\u2019s demeanor. It was like the weight of the world had been lifted. How is it that I never saw how simple that would be?</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you when you get your tattoo,\u201d I said.</p><p>Another look of astonishment. I was really learning to love that shock value.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she said, looking at me like I\u2019d sprouted horns.</p><p>I opened my mouth to respond something cute, and then paused and closed it. \u201cMaybe someone I wished my mom could have been,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd seriously, I want to be sure you\u2019re at a safe place\u2014it\u2019ll be my graduation present. Start researching it.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cSeriously, you\u2019re trusting me? With all of this? School and everything?</p><p>Burn. Again.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>And that, dear Mother, is how it\u2019s done.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>There was a letter stuck in my door when we got home, like I\u2019d closed it in the jamb a couple of times. Must have missed it. Wasn\u2019t hard to figure out the pretty handwriting on the envelope, but it made my stomach hurt just the same.</p><p>I waited till Becca left to open it.</p><p>Hey Jules,Short and sweet, but if you don\u2019t know already, I\u2019m going back home. I need family around to do this thing alone, and it\u2019s not Noah\u2019s fault about that. I\u2019m actually glad it all came out, because I don\u2019t think I would have had the stamina to hold that secret forever. And that would have been even more wrong.I just wanted to tell you good-bye. You have been a really good friend to me. One I would have never expected to have, and I was blessed to know you. He loves you, Jules. That\u2019s a hard thing for me to write . . . it took me a few minutes to do it. But it\u2019s true, and impossible to miss. And it\u2019s okay, because I feel in my gut that it\u2019s probably meant to be that way. I think you still love him, too, although you don\u2019t admit it, maybe not even to yourself. You two have that thing that we all hope to find. Cherish that. Take care of him.Love always,Your friend, Shayna</p><p>I was trembling as I read it again, and folded it up. Yeah, I was a great friend, all right.</p><p>I laid in bed awake a long time that night after Becca left, watching the shadows on the walls move with the sway of the tree outside. Listening to the many settling noises of an old house, that only seem noticeable when the life inside goes quiet.</p><p>Somehow, I\u2019d found the secret key with my daughter. Ironically, it was the same one I\u2019d always needed myself, and my mother refused it time after time. All the way to her grave. I was so grateful that I learned this lesson now, so that Becca hopefully had a chance at the life she wanted. Or at least the opportunity to try. And maybe she wouldn\u2019t be lying awake at forty-three, lamenting her life and cursing me.</p><p>I pulled my phone from my bedside table and pulled up my photos. One in particular. Seth and Noah looking at me, making my heart hurt again. You still love him, don\u2019t you? Becca had said. He loves you, Jules.</p><p>I\u2019d spent a week of nights just like this, falling asleep to the memory of being in his arms. Remembering every touch and every kiss and every inflection of each word we\u2019d said since he hit town. And every look. God, those looks of his\u2014they were worth more than a million words. Did he go to sleep every night remembering those things? Could he close his eyes and smell me the way I could him?</p><p>My heart, that I\u2019d kept protected and sealed off for so many years, even in some ways from Hayden, was now open and exposed and battered. Over a man that was taken, or so I thought. Now, all my wonderings over whether they were going to work things out\u2014if he decided to take on another man\u2019s child\u2014that was all null and void. And meant nothing if he was leaving.</p><p>If he was leaving.</p><p>A very selfish and immature imp inside me kept asking how he could leave. When a second chance was right there for the taking. When he could look at me like he did\u2014how in holy hell could he walk away again?</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the reality of the world. We weren\u2019t independently wealthy people who didn\u2019t need incomes. And Copper Falls held only grief and pain and bad memories for him. So, the logical thing to do would be to go.</p><p>I\u2019d survived it before. I\u2019d do it again.</p><p>And there was something else. Something that kept circling around after my talk with Becca. Something that made my heart race every time I considered it, and reminded me of the exhilaration on her face.</p><p>It was going to be a long night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was freezing out. Not really, but colder than my thin robe and bare feet like to dance with for long. Luckily, my newspaper was just a few feet off the porch, and Mrs. Mercer couldn\u2019t frown too much about my attire.</p><p>Not that I cared. Mrs. Mercer was likely the only one to ever see me that undressed again.</p><p>But it was okay. Just not being depressed on this day was a first. For the first time in so many years, I could face January 29 with joy, because I knew the person it belonged to.</p><p>\u201cYou should teach Harley to come pick that up for you,\u201d said a voice to my left as I stooped to pick it up; it sent my skin to a whole new level of goose bumps.</p> <p>I dropped the paper as I whirled around, leaned over to pick it up again, and stood up feeling like a jumping bean. How the hell did he always manage to catch me naked? And then that thought dissolved as the expression on Noah\u2019s face warmed me from my very core on out.</p><p>Gone were the tortured, troubled, conflicted expressions that I\u2019d become used to seeing on his face. In its place was a calm, a contentment. Dare I say he even looked happy? Had that been there last night?</p><p>They offered him his dream job.</p><p>He was leaving. This was my good-bye.</p><p>Everything in me died.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014um\u2014well, if I did that, what exercise would I get?\u201d I said.</p><p>Jesus, what drivel was that? I wrapped my arms around myself and wished for an ankle-length robe. One that wasn\u2019t sending frigid air and too-close-to Noah-vibes up into my girlie parts. No, it wasn\u2019t just being so close. It was the look. Not the death glare. Something entirely different, and damn it to hell I was just getting used to the other one.</p><p>\u201cToday is Seth\u2019s birthday,\u201d Noah said, not blinking.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is,\u201d I said, a small smile pulling at my lips. \u201cFirst time I can actually put a name to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to work today?\u201d</p><p>What the hell was this? \u201cYes, it\u2019s the first day of the carnival, it\u2019ll be crazy down there.\u201d I licked my lips and adjusted my robe. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Noah?\u201d</p> <p>His expression grew real. Too real. \u201cWanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling my heart go numb. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what\u2019s Mrs. Mercer gonna say when I follow you into your house now, with you just wearing that?\u201d Noah said, gesturing toward me and then waving toward her window.</p><p>Was he playing with me? I couldn\u2019t tell. He was different, but if he was jacking with my head, it wasn\u2019t funny. I tilted my head to study his eyes and clenched the paper tighter in my hand.</p><p>\u201cFollow me in?\u201d My knees started to shake for reasons that had little to do with the cold. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, we can talk out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t quite dressed for it,\u201d he said, his voice smooth.</p><p>\u201cIf you came to tell me good-bye, Noah, I\u2019d rather it not be in my house,\u201d I said. I was pretty impressed that the words made it out of my mouth without pause or stutter.</p><p>His eyes narrowed just slightly. \u201cAnd if I came to tell you I love you?\u201d he said, taking a step closer. \u201cDo I get to come in then?\u201d</p> <p>All my breath whooshed out of me like a hippopotamus sat on my chest, hope dancing around on top, and the newspaper landed on my foot with a thud.</p><p>\u201cNot fair,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes smiled as he picked up the paper at my feet and rose again only inches away. \u201cNever claimed to play fair,\u201d he said.</p><p>His smell enveloped me, subtle and oh so sexy, making my senses take off like a tornado. I wanted to climb inside his jacket and live there forever. But that wasn\u2019t an option. For days I\u2019d waited. Waited for this moment. For him to leave again. To tell him good-bye. And now\u2014what the hell did he just say?</p><p>My mouth worked with rapid-fire questions pinging my brain, but it wouldn\u2019t form the words.</p><p>\u201cShayna\u2019s gone,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou said that last night,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you wanted that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to make it, Jules,\u201d he said. \u201cWe both knew it. It was a last-ditch effort we were making for the baby.\u201d His jaw tightened. \u201cBut now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have been\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taken, Jules.\u201d Noah\u2019s hands landed on my upper arms, and the heat branded me through the thin fabric. \u201cI always have been, I was just too bullheaded to face it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are you saying?\u201d I asked, my head swimming.</p><p>\u201cClearly not enough,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cDid you miss the part earlier when I said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I heard you,\u201d I said, my fingers landing on his lips to keep him from saying it again. \u201cThat\u2019s back where my heart stopped, I\u2019m pretty clear on it.\u201d His eyes darkened with desire at my touch, and that along with the feel of his mouth under my fingertips sent heat to every inch of my body. Was it possible to sweat in forty-degree weather with nothing on but a piece of faux silk? I dropped my hand but he caught it, holding it against his chest. Yeah, not better. \u201cI just\u2014it\u2019s not that simple, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, it is,\u201d he said, using my hand to pull me closer. \u201cIt\u2019s what I should have depended on back then, and I didn\u2019t.\u201d His gaze bored into mine. \u201cI won\u2019t make that mistake again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your job interview,\u201d I began. \u201cIt\u2014you got what you wanted, didn\u2019t you? I can see it on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I\u2019m that eaten up that my job is what\u2019s on my face right now?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that is very much not what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said, so close that I could feel the heat from his body.</p><p>My breathing quickened. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s a job, not a life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had it the other way around. This time\u2019s different. Part of the deal was that I live wherever I want,\u201d he finished. \u201cWith the woman I love.\u201d His hands slid upward into my hair, holding my head as he leaned his face toward mine. \u201cI . . . am . . . taken,\u201d he said softly, not blinking. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>My heart was thundering in my ears. \u201cStarting to catch on.\u201d</p><p>His lips brushed my forehead and then moved down my cheek. \u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d I whispered, my hands moving upward to his face all on their own. \u201cNo more obstacles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo girlfriends\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe one girlfriend, if she\u2019ll have me,\u201d he said, his lips touching mine lightly and making my bare toes curl on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cNo \u2018Love Shack\u2019?\u201d I said against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll throw my phone in the toilet,\u201d he said, claiming my lips with his. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d It was the friggin\u2019 sexiest thing anyone had ever said to me.</p><p>His mouth was warm and electric and on fire. And mine. He was mine. Hot emotion burned my eyes at that realization as I wound my arms around his neck and pulled his head in tighter to me. The ground left me as he lifted me off my feet, kissing me like a man starved.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably go in,\u201d he said finally on a breath, then kissing me again. \u201cMrs. Mercer\u2019s going to have cardiac arrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo might I,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have a man upstairs again, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today, it\u2019s been a slow week.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and drew my bottom lip between his teeth, running his tongue along it and making my fingers tingle. \u201cFor me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should remedy that.\u201d</p><p>Noah groaned against my lips, and I felt his fingers flex in my hair and around my waist where he held me up. \u201cIs that an invitation?\u201d</p><p>It was everything in my power not to wrap my legs around him right there in the front yard and hump him like a dog. God, I\u2019d never wanted or needed anyone more than I wanted him. Right there.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Noah,\u201d I said with every ounce of everything I had in me, and relishing the rush of emotion that passed across his face.</p><p>\u201cThose are good words,\u201d he said, his voice a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I whispered back.</p><p>Gently, he set me on my feet and took my hand, and we walked up the porch steps and through the front door. Harley was back asleep on the couch, guard dog that she was, but I was grateful. I didn\u2019t want the distraction. I didn\u2019t want him to have to stop for anything.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even pause to turn around as he closed the door behind us. I walked steadily up the stairs, letting the robe slip off me as I went.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d I heard him mutter under his breath before the sounds of footsteps followed me.</p><p>By the time I reached my bedroom, my need was cranked so high he could have made me orgasm from the stairway. And the look on his face when he reached the doorway and I turned to face him just about did it.</p><p>His eyes did a slow drag of my body, stopping at my face with a look of so much\u2014everything\u2014I had to grip the bedpost behind me. Not in twenty-six years had I seen intensity like that. Desire, lust, love, happiness and\u2014raw energy. He approached me slowly, never taking his eyes off mine, and when he simply pushed a strand of hair from my eyes, my knees nearly buckled.</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d I whispered raggedly.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jules,\u201d he said, his eyes dark with heat and love and something primal. Shit, that took my breath away. \u201cAnd you\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t know you were naked under that robe or we\u2019d have never made it to the porch.\u201d</p><p>Oh, holy crap. I started unbuttoning his shirt with trembling fingers, trying to keep from just ripping it apart.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that you want me?\u201d I asked, smiling up at him, attempting cute through my haze of lust.</p><p>Electricity emanated off him, like we\u2019d spark if we rubbed together too much. Oh, I was all about finding that out. I almost had those damn buttons undone, and I needed him. I needed skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I really planned on making love to you slow and sexy, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>The last button gave way and I went for his chest with my mouth, cutting off his words as he sucked in a breath. He tasted as amazing as he smelled. I couldn\u2019t do slow. I was about to derail.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, Noah, please,\u201d I said against his chest, my nails raking down his abdomen as I set to work on his jeans.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d he growled, his fingers tangling in my hair as he grabbed my head and tugged it back. \u201cI need you, Jules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you now,\u201d I said, my voice sounding odd and animalistic to my ears. \u201cPlease, let\u2019s do slow later.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s mouth came down on mine with a smile. \u201cGod, I love you,\u201d he breathed, ridding himself of his jeans in two seconds flat.</p><p>Skin to skin, his kisses diving deeper, his hands roaming my body, I lit on fire. I couldn\u2019t get close enough. One lift and I was up and wrapped around him, hard body in front of me and hard bedpost at my back.</p><p>His shoulder muscles rippled as he held me in place and his expression was all fire as he looked into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d he said through his teeth, playing on my words in a much hotter way.</p><p>I moved against him, his hair in my hands. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Growling desire, his fingers found me, and as I moaned and bucked with arousal at his touch, he thrust into me.</p><p>Oh, God, finally. We both cried out, the sounds foreign and primal as we finally got what we wanted. His fingers dug into my thighs as he slammed into me again and again. The post punished my back, but all I could feel was the exquisite torture of riding a building wave. And all I could see was my Noah. My Noah. His face contorted with exertion and ecstasy as he rode that wave with me. It didn\u2019t take me long. My body started to shake uncontrollably as I reached the top and digging into his shoulders wasn\u2019t enough. I arched into it, reaching over my head to the bedpost behind me as it twisted me out of control.</p><p>Crazy noises came from my throat, from somewhere I\u2019d never visited before. Noises of losing control. Screaming his name. It was taking me over. Through it all, I heard him rumbling and cursing and then it was hitting him. His whole body shook as he pounded me harder and let out his own roar of release.</p><p>We came down together, slowing down, my arms wrapped around his head, our bodies slick with sweat. Both still trembling and gasping for air, whispering each other\u2019s names. And I was hit with something very exposed. We were one again. After twenty-six years, we were one. I leaned back to take his face in my hands and was touched to the core by the look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSay it again,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>Laughter bubbled up from my chest, and I kissed him, saying the words against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you back.\u201d</p><p>I would never, ever get tired of that.</p><p>\u201cWell, that didn\u2019t take long. So much for foreplay, huh?\u201d he said, a sheepish grin pulling at his lips.</p><p>\u201cMy living room floor was foreplay, baby,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been ready for you ever since.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled silently. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was hot,\u201d I said.</p><p>He leaned his head back to look in my eyes. \u201cLike that, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad, because I can\u2019t feel my legs anymore,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re probably off visiting my spine wherever it went to live,\u201d I said, now feeling the bedpost a little more now that the monkey sex wasn\u2019t distracting me.</p><p>Laughing, he let go of one leg at a time as we tried to disentangle ourselves and flop onto the bed.</p><p>\u201cThink we\u2019re too old for crazy like that?\u201d he asked, threading his fingers through mine.</p><p>I looked at his body, and my God he was glorious. There was nothing old there.</p><p>\u201cHell, no,\u201d I said. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s how I want to go out.\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned, rolling onto his side. \u201cBanged against a bedpost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m eighty,\u201d I said. \u201cNo, eighty-nine. Ninety-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, we\u2019d better get a gym membership,\u201d he said.</p><p>Laughing, I leaned in to kiss him, enjoying the soft slowness of it. His fingers played in my hair as we languished in the moment. God, he was delicious.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d I said softly, kissing him again.</p><p>\u201cSo have I,\u201d he said, looking into my eyes. \u201cNever have to again.\u201d</p><p>It was surreal. \u201cI almost can\u2019t believe we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I finally had sex in this house,\u201d he said, and then grimaced. \u201cProbably a little late to ask if Becca is here, huh?\u201d</p><p>I snickered and thumped him in the chest. \u201cYeah, I wouldn\u2019t be dropping my robe for you on the steps if she were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that was hot,\u201d he said, running a hand over my hip as if remembering where his eyes had traveled.</p><p>\u201cWay outside my box,\u201d I said on a chuckle. \u201cNever done that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you do it again,\u201d he said, nuzzling my neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, you will, will you?\u201d I said, closing my eyes to enjoy it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m generous like that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnytime you want is fine.\u201d</p><p>I laughed with him and our eyes met for a quiet moment. The feeling was so overwhelming, my whole body tingled with goose bumps.</p><p>He noticed and ran a hand over my arm. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really thought you were leaving,\u201d I said.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNever again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I said, touching his face, and watching his expression change with the words. He inhaled quickly and blinked, and I knew I always wanted to do that. Keep him surprised and take his breath away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved you, Jules,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for leaving that behind.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNo more sorries. We move on from here.\u201d I kissed his lips and relished the rush of being able to do that at will. \u201cYou\u2019ve had my heart from the first time you ever kissed me till now. Even when I took your ring off, I just closed up everything inside so no one else could go where you\u2019d been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, that tiny ring,\u201d he said, lifting my hand and threading his fingers through mine. \u201cI saved forever to get that tiny little chip.\u201d Noah smiled and kissed my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI still have it,\u201d I said.</p><p>He looked at me in surprise. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat did you think, that I\u2019d throw it away?\u201d</p><p>He widened his eyes. \u201cBasically.\u201d</p><p>I frowned and shook my head, rolling away. \u201cHang on a second. Let me show you something.\u201d I got up and strolled naked to my hope chest, which sat under a window and held everything special to me since I was twelve. Inside, under two quilts, multiple boxes of cards and mementos, and all of Becca\u2019s baby stuff, was a small wooden box. I pulled it out and went back to join him, where he still lay propped up on one hand, watching me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Jules,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>I warmed from my scalp on down and smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>I took a little preparatory breath before opening the box that had remained closed for over two decades. The little hinges squeaked as I lifted the lid.</p><p>Yellowed paper notes, folded and stacked, were inside. Along with a small black fuzzy box, some Polaroid photos of us being silly and one of me about six months pregnant, a piece of string, my hospital bracelet, and a foil-covered roll of LifeSavers without the label.</p><p>Noah picked up the LifeSavers and looked at me in question.</p><p>\u201cYou bought them for me on the way to the hospital,\u201d I said, causing his eyes to water. \u201cHey.\u201d I touched his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you saved that,\u201d he said, his voice thick with emotion.</p><p>\u201cIt mattered,\u201d I said. I picked up the string and held it to my lips. \u201cSo did this.\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned and wiped quickly at his eyes. \u201cThe real first ring.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYep.\u201d I reached for the black box, but he covered my hand.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see that, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm\u2014okay.\u201d</p><p>He blinked and another tear fell out that he whisked away with annoyance. \u201cI made you take that off and bury it away. It\u2019s tainted\u2014it was from an us that didn\u2019t get to finish.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled at the emotional words from him. Especially when he picked up the little piece of string and sat up.</p><p>Taking my left hand, he started tying it onto my finger, as I watched, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cOne day I\u2019m gonna put another ring on this finger. When we\u2019re ready,\u201d he said, clearing his throat of the emotion that was taking over. \u201cThat may sound fast, but it isn\u2019t really. We\u2019ve just been on hold for a long time. This time I don\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>My chin trembled and I tried unsuccessfully to blink back tears as I looked at the little string on my finger again and nervous laughter bubbled up from my chest.</p><p>\u201cIs that a proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is the proposal string, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I laughed and pulled him back down to me, kissing him until it got serious again and he rolled over, pulling me on top of him.</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I said against his chest, loving the feel of his body responding under me. \u201cYou know all that noise you made earlier? I\u2019m gonna make you do that again.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a coincidence. I was thinking the same thing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that,\u201d I purred.</p><p>\u201cVery slowly,\u201d he said. \u201cStarting with my mouth.\u201d</p><p>Holy crap, I was halfway there. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thank God I didn\u2019t have to be at the store till nine o\u2019clock. Which I was late for, rolling in around 9:45.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I said, rushing in the door fifteen minutes before the parade started.</p><p>Ruthie was finishing sales and directing people to the hot chocolate on their way out. She gave me an exasperated look as I ran behind the counter to relieve her. I was better there. She was better out on the floor, doing the actual mingling thing.</p><p>I got a once-over and a raised eyebrow as she took note of my jeans and white lace sweater.</p> <p>\u201cLiking this casual thing once you crossed over to the dark side?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at a customer as I bagged up her books and thanked her. \u201cA bit tight for time this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>When I rang up the next customer without answering, she leaned over in my face.</p><p>\u201cIs Patrick back?\u201d she whispered, mischievously.</p> <p>I scoffed. \u201cNo!\u201d Laughing, I said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have people out there to be all festive with?\u201d</p><p>After fifteen minutes and a lull in the activity, she hit me up again.</p><p>\u201cOkay, chica,\u201d she began, her voice low for the three people still in the store. \u201cYou are all glowing and crap, you need to spill\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her words stopped abruptly as her eyes fell on my left hand. Grabbing it, she held it up to me as if I needed to be made aware of the violation.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cWhat the living hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d said a voice behind us. We turned to see Noah strolling in, hands in his jacket pockets and a lazy smile on his face.</p> <p>My bones melted inside me, and it was sheer force of will to stay on my feet. I instantly wanted to curl up all over him and do naughty things.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I said with a smile, my skin tingling all over when he placed a soft kiss on my lips. I think I was trembling. I looked at my hand. Most definitely wiggling a little.</p><p>Ruthie\u2019s eyes went back and forth between us, widening progressively. \u201cThis is new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s pretty old,\u201d Noah said, patting her shoulder. \u201cWhich makes you old, as well. You gonna have a problem with me?\u201d</p><p>She frowned like she\u2019d woken up in the wrong movie and twisted her hair up in a messy clip, as if that would clear the fog. \u201cPossibly. You plan on being a dick again?\u201d</p><p>Noah grinned. \u201cSee, it\u2019s that charm that makes you special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not joking,\u201d she said, smiling for the minimal public but shooting ice daggers from her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened between yesterday and today, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve missed something key, but if you\u2019re coming in here with PDAs and doing this again\u201d\u2014Ruthie lifted my hand with the string still around my finger\u2014\u201cyou\u2019d better damn well not be messing around.\u201d</p><p>My personal mama tigress. I loved Ruthie.</p> <p>Noah\u2019s face got serious. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m messing around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFound that I\u2019m not a great judge of character when it comes to you,\u201d she said, her eyes narrowed. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to prove my intentions then,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said. \u201cY\u2019all realize I\u2019m right here, right?\u201d</p><p>A smile entered his eyes as he looked at her, oblivious to what I\u2019d said. \u201cHmm, a challenge, Ruth Ann.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sarcastic smile. \u201cLots of heavy books in here to pummel you with. Don\u2019t test me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll restrain myself,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t be a dick,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re good.\u201d She picked up some bestsellers from a display and started to walk up front with them, displaying them for effect before the parade started. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d she asked me, pausing as she passed.</p><p>I smiled and hugged her with her arms full of books. \u201cI\u2019m positive. And hey, I need to talk to you later. Before we leave tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds ominous.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cNot ominous. Just a thought.\u201d</p><p>Outside, the parade was beginning, and thanks to a pretty day we could prop the doors open a bit so people could mill.</p><p>\u201cSnowflakes,\u201d Noah said on a laugh. \u201cNever understood that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t even get me started,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cStill a skeptic?\u201d he said. \u201cI remember it snowing the day Seth was born.\u201d</p><p>The pang to my gut was still there, but followed by a face. A happy face.</p><p>\u201cYes, and today it\u2019s now over fifty degrees and sunny. So I don\u2019t see snow in our future. It\u2019s not like Groundhog Day.\u201d I scoffed. \u201cI see a lot of melted soap later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposed to get cold tonight, though,\u201d Ruthie said. \u201cSaw it on the forecast. Big blast coming through.\u201d</p><p>Georgette Pruitt drifted by, all plump and happy on her trailer of white flowers, followed by a giant snowflake-encrusted castle, manned by none other than Becca and Lizzy\u2019s family.</p><p>We hooted and hollered and generally did everything we could to embarrass her, but I didn\u2019t miss her questioning glance at Noah\u2019s arm resting on my shoulders.</p><p>I texted her, Yep.</p><p>She texted back OMG with a smiley face.</p><p>The communication generation.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are you doing tonight?\u201d Noah asked in my ear as another truck went by with fluttery white things that were intended to be snow but really looked like aliens.</p><p>Hopefully, a repeat of the morning. If he kept talking that close to my ear, however, things could very well take care of themselves. My nerve endings were so hyperaware of him, it wasn\u2019t taking much.</p><p>\u201cNo plans, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to the carnival with me?\u201d</p><p>Oh, blech. I gave him a beseeching look. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been in decades,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI assure you, you were bored then, and we always found other things to do,\u201d I said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumor me,\u201d he said, his voice a whisper, his eyes dancing. \u201cI want to walk around town with you tonight. Eat chili and fried everything. Celebrate today.\u201d</p><p>I watched his lips as he spoke, and I wanted to lick them. Okay, so he\u2019d brought out my more carnal urges.</p><p>\u201cYou play dirty,\u201d I said. \u201cNot fair bringing Seth into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you I don\u2019t play fair,\u201d he said, staring at my mouth as well. \u201cIs Becca home tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s staying another night at Lizzy\u2019s,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThen I promise I\u2019ll make it worth your while after the carnival,\u201d he said, pulling me close to him.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>Ruthie and I were cleaning up after a very chaotic, productive day. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d she said while she ran the sales tape for the close of the day. \u201cYou actually watched the parade for once. Can\u2019t remember the last time you even bothered to go outside for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen Bec was little,\u201d I said, collapsing into a chair. My muscles were stiffening up a little from the morning\u2019s acrobatics. I smiled as I thought about that.</p><p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d take her out there and you\u2019ve always had something else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCustomers,\u201d I said, gesturing around me as if there were hoards to prove it.</p><p>\u201cOh, whatever,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, was it Noah\u2019s influence that got you out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, scoffing. \u201cMaybe it was just a good mood? I do have those. And Becca was in it, so I had to watch for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was a sex high,\u201d Ruthie said, giving me a cockeyed questioning look.</p><p>\u201cI vote for that,\u201d I said, raising my hand.</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d she said. \u201cI knew you had that just-laid look about you.\u201d She laughed and threw a stale cookie at me.</p><p>I took a bite. I wasn\u2019t proud. I didn\u2019t have time to go get lunch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping I have that look again tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I have to go to this stupid carnival first.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie sighed. \u201cAnnnnnd . . . the Grinch is back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, you don\u2019t get tired of it?\u201d I asked. \u201cWe hear that damn music all day, smell the grease all day. You want to go back at night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re demented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re just tainted,\u201d she said. \u201cThis year\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, so different,\u201d I said, laying a hand on my chest. \u201cI need to call Seth again, speaking of that. He didn\u2019t answer earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to you,\u201d Ruthie said, stopping. \u201cDid you ever think you\u2019d be able to say those words?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what did you want to talk to me about that wasn\u2019t ominous?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I looked at her for a couple of beats, taking a deep breath before making the jump. Hope you\u2019re okay with this, Mom. And if you\u2019re not, I really don\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cSettling.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cSettling on what?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do here without you, Ruthie. Especially the last few weeks while I lost my mind.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie laughed softly and came to flop in the chair across from me.</p><p>\u201cNo big deal, that\u2019s what we do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s what you do,\u201d I said. \u201cYou take care of me. You always have. But you also took over the store.\u201d I gestured around us. \u201cYou ran the place. And let\u2019s be honest, you were doing most of that already anyway.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie shrugged. \u201cI enjoy it, Jules. I love this store. We grew up in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I never fell in love with it like you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just because you mom shoved it down your throat,\u201d she said, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014I mean, yeah, that\u2019s part of it,\u201d I said. \u201cBut also I\u2019m just not wired for this. Running a business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Ruthie said, leaning forward, looking concerned. \u201cThat you want out?\u201d</p><p>I looked around me, at all that my mother had created and handed over to me. Never settle, baby.</p><p>\u201cI settled on my whole life because my mother told me to,\u201d I said. \u201cGave up my son, my dreams, and my guy because she said to. Took this store\u2014even moved into her house because she designed it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJules,\u201d she said, pulling my attention back. \u201cWhere are you going with this?\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath. \u201cI want to sell the store.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie sat back, looking conflicted.</p><p>\u201cTo you,\u201d I continued.</p><p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>I grimaced. \u201cIs that good?\u201d</p><p>She waved her hands around in lieu of the words that eluded her. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of\u2014wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you said you wanted to start a business, and I know this one\u2019s not new, but no one I know has the passion and drive to take this place on like you do,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I wouldn\u2019t just leave, I\u2019d stay to help you with anything you need. I just have other things I want to dive into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014blown away,\u201d she said, getting up and sitting on the arm of my chair to hug me. \u201cOh, my God, Jules, this is surreal, my head is spinning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is that a yes?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, let me talk to Frank about it, but let\u2019s whisper yes right now and yell it on Monday,\u201d she said.</p><p>I laughed and hugged her again. I had thought that would be difficult, but once I started it was like the store was jumping to get away from me. I couldn\u2019t really blame it.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God, and I got a rocking chair!\u201d she said, pulling back. \u201cI forgot to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat one I failed you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. A better one at Old Tin Barnes,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw Savanna Barnes at the bank and she hooked me up. She had one much more rustic, and cheaper, and Frank is making it awesome.\u201d Ruthie stopped and hugged her arms to herself. \u201cOh, wow, and it might be the first thing I put in my store,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>It was contagious, her giddiness. Like watching Becca see everything ahead of her.</p><p>Ruthie shook her head free and smiled, her eyes shining. \u201cSo, what are these things you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo concrete plans, but\u2014Becca suggested some art classes, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she exclaimed, jumping up and making me laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you got reacquainted with your freaky self! I used to love your artwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have some time and money, now that Becca is putting off college a year\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s another story. She\u2019s going to work on her writing.\u201d</p><p>Ruthie backed up and studied me. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the exact thing Becca said,\u201d I said, smiling, feeling the weight of old crotchety me lifting by the minute.</p><p>\u201cWell, you are stepping outside your box, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think of that tonight at the carnival,\u201d she said, to which I groaned. \u201cMore box-stepping,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can do it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The temperature dropped thirty degrees since our sunny day at noon.

I was going on a date with Noah Ryan for the first time in twenty-six years.</p><p>With the possibility of a sleepover of my own.</p><p>I was such a slut.</p> <p>And when Noah arrived an hour early, with a delicious look of desire in his eyes, I was eager to explore that. Which we did. All over my kitchen. And I didn\u2019t even obsess about sanitization. I figured I could worry about that later, and he was worth every bit of it. If I could have kept him naked 24/7, I would have.</p><p>Lord, who was I?</p><p>Evidently I was a woman held down by rules and boundaries for far too long.</p><p>There was also something to be said for Noah in clothes, too. In faded jeans, boots, a dark blue button-down shirt and that do-me-on-the-table leather jacket of his, I was salivating.</p><p>\u201cYou taste like cupcakes,\u201d he said later, licking and kissing my neck as I attempted to get ready. We\u2019d already gone two rounds.</p> <p>\u201cVanilla and coconut lime body splash,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMmm, it makes me want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain?\u201d I said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI was gonna say go buy some cake,\u201d he said on a grin. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be game again in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Seth today?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\u2019ve tried calling him but he hasn\u2019t answered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right after I left here, before the parade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHmm, guess I just keep missing him,\u201d I said. \u201cDoes he have big plans for the day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was spending the day with family,\u201d he said.</p><p>I felt a prick of pain to my heart on the word, but then let it go. It was right that he do that. It was right.</p><p>Icy air hit me like a wall when we parked in front of the bookstore and got out.</p><p>\u201cD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d I said. \u201cSure seems like I was just here. Oh, geez,\u201d I muttered, pulling my coat tighter around me. \u201cWhat is wrong with these people?\u201d</p><p>Food aromas assaulted our senses. Either it had gotten stronger with the thicker, denser air or we had some serious post-sex munchies going on. I wanted it all.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose there\u2019s like a sampler platter,\u201d Noah said as we approached the various chili booths.</p><p>\u201cUh, no,\u201d came a familiar voice behind us. Linny stood behind a table with a patio cover overhead, a giant red apron announcing 1st Place Winner emblazoned across the front. A matching banner hung overhead. \u201cThere\u2019s only one bowl of chili you need to get.\u201d</p> <p>I sucked a breath and ran to hug her. \u201cOh, my God, Linny!\u201d I said. \u201cYou won! Holy shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, isn\u2019t it crazy?\u201d she said, her face pink with pride and the cold.</p><p>\u201cCrazy?\u201d I said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s awesome! It\u2019s about time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve entered before?\u201d Noah asked behind me.</p><p>\u201cEvery year,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGeorgette Pruitt has won every single year for\u2014I don\u2019t know, fifteen years?\u201d I said under my breath in case she was lurking.</p><p>\u201cAt least,\u201d Linny said.</p><p>\u201cWay to go,\u201d Noah said, hugging her. \u201cServe us some up. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd I want extra. I\u2019m even hungrier than he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said, looking down at me with mischief in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, I do,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re saving room for cake, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can have both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Linny said, raising her hand. \u201cHave I missed an announcement or something?\u201d She pointed to us in turn. \u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis morning,\u201d I said, unable to keep the ridiculous smile off my face.</p><p>\u201cOh, thank God!\u201d she said, coming around the table to maul us at the same time. \u201cOh, man, I prayed this would happen. Not that Shayna wasn\u2019t nice, but\u2014you\u2019re just family. Oh, Lord, I\u2019m so excited.\u201d</p><p>When I laughed, she clamped a hand down on each of our arms and looked up in Noah\u2019s face with amusement in her eyes. \u201cDad\u2019s gonna shit a brick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>\u201cHey, he actually hired Becca,\u201d I said. \u201cSo maybe he\u2019s mellowing in his old age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d she said, pointing at me. \u201cAnd\u2014I haven\u2019t seen the cane in action for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, the music has evidently stopped,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the day the music died,\u201d she said, nodding to keep a straight face while I snickered.</p><p>\u201cSo can we have some chili now?\u201d Noah asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, men,\u201d Linny scolded. \u201cWe\u2019re talking drama, and all they can think about is food.\u201d</p><p>Not all, but I wasn\u2019t going there with Noah\u2019s sister. She ladled up two helpings of steaming chili and a generous handful of shredded cheese into two plastic bowls.</p><p>\u201cFritos?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d I said, while Noah declined. I shook my head at him. \u201cItaly ruined you.\u201d</p><p>He turned to me before he took his first bite. \u201cWell, then you have the rest of our lives to get me back in line.\u201d</p><p>The cold almost disappeared there for a second as those words warmed me down to my toes. The day couldn\u2019t get any better, and I was afraid to keep thinking that. Afraid I\u2019d jinx it. Only downside is that I hadn\u2019t gotten to talk to Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Nana was here just a little bit ago,\u201d Linny said.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019d she get here?\u201d</p><p>Linny shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t know, but she\u2019s eating like a wild boar on a tear.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cProbably bribing people for their recipes, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she tried,\u201d Linny said with a wink. \u201cBut I don\u2019t cave easily. Did you hear that it might actually snow?\u201d she said, grinning like a kid. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be something?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, it would be something. Especially today, but the odds of that were nearly zero. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold my breath,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just get sleet or something.\u201d</p><p>The chili thawed me completely. Only thing better was if I could have soaked my hands in it. But it left my mouth warm and tingling with Texas spice, the way chili ought to be.</p><p>\u201cMmm, Linny, this is amazing,\u201d Noah said. \u201cI never knew you could cook like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways thought it was the best,\u201d I said. \u201cHas Hayden been out yet to get some? You know he goes loopy for your chili.\u201d</p><p>She pinked up again. \u201cHe did, actually. Came by a couple of hours ago\u2014with a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said, warmth flooding me again. \u201cGood for him. He needs someone.\u201d</p><p>Heavy music started up nearby, rumbling the very sidewalk under my feet.</p><p>\u201cGo check out the band,\u201d Linny said. \u201cI heard they are supposed to be good.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so far the carnival wasn\u2019t a complete bust. I had to admit it. Even with the silly snowflakes hanging\u2014wilted and floppy in some cases, spiky wooden weapons in others\u2014it wasn\u2019t so bad. Maybe it was the company.</p><p>Walking around hand in hand with Noah made the very air around us feel full of magic and promise. It was like being a teenager again in an old body.</p><p>We bought a slice of cake, and the look in Noah\u2019s eyes as I fed it to him was priceless. I was pretty sure my fingers and toes had frostbite, but I no longer cared.</p><p>We reached the makeshift bandstand, which was really an oversized tractor trailer in front of the gazebo, and the band was pretty good. And when Noah grabbed my numb gloved hand and pulled me into his arms for a slow dance, I decided it was the best band ever. I\u2019d even buy their CD. Yep, I was a teenager again.</p><p>Noah\u2019s arms wrapped inside my coat, and his face came down to mine as I pulled him closer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let go,\u201d I mumbled against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said, smiling at the words, shutting me up with a slow warm kiss that moved my blood all the way to my fingertips and back again.</p><p>The whole town disappeared as the music vibrated the air and I was enveloped in everything Noah. His scent, his taste, and the feel of his body. And I wasn\u2019t stealing a forbidden moment or taking what wasn\u2019t mine. Noah Ryan was mine. Had been since that long ago day with the Dr. Pepper. We\u2019d just been on hold for a while.</p><p>I chuckled as the song ended and he glanced at his watch.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere you have to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d he said, winking at me. \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><p>He led me around more food booths, where I found Nana Mae and another lady loading up on funnel cake.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here in the frozen tundra?\u201d I asked, giving her a hug.</p><p>\u201cGetting my sugar high on, sweetheart,\u201d she said, nudging the other woman who had just stuffed a large doughy piece in her mouth and proceeded to laugh around it. \u201cTrolling for old men. You know Clara Sullivan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Julianna White,\u201d I said, holding out a hand and chuckling at my grandmother.</p><p>\u201cSo nice to meet you sweetie,\u201d she said. \u201cMae talks about you all the time.\u201d And then both women looked at my date.</p><p>\u201cThis is Noah,\u201d I said, looping my arm with his. \u201cNoah Ryan.\u201d I looked Nana Mae in the eyes. I didn\u2019t know what to call him, but it didn\u2019t matter. She knew my heart.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you again, Noah Ryan,\u201d she said, a knowing smile warming her face.</p><p>Noah hugged her, making her widen her eyes at me like a school girl. \u201cNice to be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get here?\u201d I asked, touching her arm. \u201cMrs. Sullivan drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got a ride,\u201d she said with a wink. \u201cNow, you two go do what you were headed to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got fried crap to indulge on.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, and eyed that funnel cake, making a note to revisit that. It had been many years since I\u2019d indulged in that. Lord, how I\u2019d fallen. We twisted and turned through the rides until we emerged on the other side, looking at the park.</p><p>\u201cI think we have a date with a bench,\u201d he said.</p><p>Warm tears touched the backs of my eyes, but they were happy ones. And that in itself was a miracle for this day. Happiness instead of hollow, empty regret. Having a face and a personality to put with the memory of what we created.</p><p>It being Seth\u2019s birthday, instead of the day we lost everything.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d I said, linking an arm in his and hugging him to me as we walked the winding path.</p><p>It was odd and somewhat surreal to walk it with him instead of alone. But that was nothing compared to the view that awaited me when we rounded the last bend.</p><p>Standing in front of our bench was Seth.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>I blinked in the low light glowing from the solar lamps and my whole body buzzed with energy.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God!\u201d I exclaimed, letting go of Noah and running to him.</p><p>Seth laughed as I tackled him, hugging him tight. \u201cSurprise,\u201d he said.</p><p>I let go and backed up, holding his beautiful face in my gloved hands. \u201cOh, holy crap, you aren\u2019t kidding,\u201d I said. \u201cHappy birthday, baby.\u201d</p><p>I knew I was crying and didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d seen me weepy more than not, and one day I might not cry every time I saw him, but I wasn\u2019t there yet.</p><p>\u201cI figured this birthday warranted something a little different,\u201d he said, smiling down at me with Noah\u2019s young face. \u201cAnd when Noah told me about this place and how it all went down\u2014well, I remembered the painting in your living room. Thought it was fitting.\u201d</p><p>My chin trembled and I nodded. There were no words. I turned to gaze at Noah as he strolled up, hands in his pockets, always the casual yet spring-loaded pose.</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday, bud,\u201d Noah said, pulling Seth to him in that backslapping man-hug thing that guys do. \u201cGood to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about this,\u201d I said.</p><p>He widened his eyes at me. \u201cI\u2019ll never tell.\u201d</p><p>I shoved at him and turned back to Seth. \u201cHave you had a good day?\u201d I asked. \u201cDid you get cake? There\u2019s about fifty pounds of it back there,\u201d I said, pointing behind us.</p><p>He smiled guiltily. \u201cActually, I did. Earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cI met Becca and her friend and hung out with them for a bit. She made me have cake. Two pieces.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped. \u201cSeriously?\u201d That explained the random smiley faces. That girl.</p><p>\u201cI made her promise not to tell you,\u201d he said.</p><p>I loved it. He hung out with his sister. Oh, holy hell, I loved it so much I was going to cry again.</p><p>\u201cAnd Linny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, her too,\u201d he said.</p><p>I wiped at my face and reached for them both. \u201cI love y\u2019all,\u201d I said, overcome, hugging them tightly to me. Then I turned to face Noah, trying to convey with my eyes everything I was too emotional to say. He dropped a sweet kiss on my lips, telling me he got it all.</p><p>\u201cThis is new,\u201d Seth said.</p><p>\u201cTook your advice,\u201d Noah said with a small grin.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d Seth said, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cEnough with the man code,\u201d I said, linking arms with both of them and walking to the bench. Our bench. \u201cWhat advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to know everything.\u201d</p><p>Used to think I did, but I had to say, I was learning.</p><p>\u201cSuffice it to say,\u201d Seth said as we sat. \u201cThat all appears to have worked out.\u201d He glanced sideways at me. \u201cKinda cool that y\u2019all are back together,\u201d he said. \u201cLike it\u2019s all come full circle.\u201d</p><p>Noah was quiet and I looked at his profile as he gazed off at where the river glistened black and sparkling.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I asked softly, nudging him.</p><p>\u201cFull circle,\u201d he echoed. \u201cThe music back there,\u201d he said. \u201cSitting here on this particular day, the three of us.\u201d His voice grew husky and I knew what he was going to say. \u201cThe last time we were all here together was the day he was born.\u201d Noah looked at both of us. \u201cNow, here we are. Together again.\u201d He blew out a breath and shook his head, facing forward again. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see this day.\u201d</p><p>I wiped the tears that were streaming down my face too quickly to freeze there, and I noticed Seth discreetly rub his eyes as well.</p><p>\u201cSeth, I\u2019ve come out here every year,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd this is the best birthday of yours I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d He laughed and I laid my head against his shoulder. \u201cThank you so much for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way,\u201d he said.</p><p>As I looked out at the river, my two guys on either side of me, I realized my chance had finally come.</p><p>\u201cThat painting in my living room,\u201d I said, lifting my head to look at him. \u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it for you, a couple of weeks after you were born,\u201d I said. \u201cIn my mind, it was a gift to you. Something to save the moment. Something my mother couldn\u2019t steal.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s other hand came over mine.</p><p>\u201cIt was all I had of you, but now it\u2019s not,\u201d I said. \u201cI have more than a memory on a canvas now. I have the real thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re giving it to me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you want it,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ve been holding it for you for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d he said, blinking away. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I was wrong before, thinking I\u2019d had the perfect January 29. Now I had. Nothing could ever top this. Not ever.</p><p>Then Noah started laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said. Then I saw it. \u201cOh, holy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Noah said.</p><p>Two snowflakes drifted down between us. Then three more. It wasn\u2019t possible. Zero odds.</p><p>I met Noah\u2019s eyes and remembered that other day\u2014as snow began to fall, with his LifeSavers clutched in my hand and his words about miracles.</p><p>Our son was right. We really had come full circle. </p> </body></html>"]
