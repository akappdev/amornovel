Some people get luck handed to them, a second chance, a save. It can happen heroically, or by a simple coincidence, but there are those who don\u2019t get luck on a shiny platter, who end up in the wrong place at the wrong time, who don\u2019t get saved.</p><p>\u201cCallie, are you listening to me?\u201d My mom asks as she parks the car in the driveway.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer, watching the leaves twirl in the wind across the yard, the hood of the car, wherever the breeze forces them to go. They have no control over their path in life. I have a desire to jump out, grab them all, and clutch them in my hand, but that would mean getting out of the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you tonight?\u201d my mom snaps as she checks her phone messages. \u201cJust go in and get your brother.\u201d</p><p>I tear my gaze off the leaves and focus on her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me do this, Mom.\u201d My sweaty hand grips the metal door handle and a massive lump lodges in my throat. \u201cCan\u2019t you just go in and get him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no desire to go into a party with a bunch of high school kids and I\u2019m really not in the mood to chat it up with Maci right now, so she can brag about Kayden getting a scholarship,\u201d my mother replies, motioning her manicured hand at me to get a move on. \u201cNow go get your brother and tell him he needs to come home.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders hunch as I push the door open and hike up the gravel driveway toward the two-story mansion with green shutters and a steep roof. \u201cTwo more days, two more days,\u201d I chant under my breath with my hands clenched into fists as I squeeze between the vehicles. \u201cOnly two more days and I\u2019ll be in college and none of this will matter.\u201d</p><p>The lights through the windows illuminate against the grey sky and a \u201cCongratulations\u201d banner hangs above the entrance to the porch, decorated with balloons. The Owens always like to put on a show, for any reason they can think of; birthdays, holidays, graduations. They seem like the perfect family but I don\u2019t believe in perfection.</p><p>This party is to celebrate their youngest son Kayden\u2019s graduation and his football scholarship to the University of Wyoming. I have nothing against the Owens. My family has dinner over at their house occasionally and they attend barbeques at our place. I just don\u2019t like parties, nor have I been welcomed at one, at least since sixth grade.</p><p>When I approach the wrap-around porch, Daisy Miller waltzes out with a glass in her hand. Her curly blond hair shines in the porch light as her eyes aim at me and a malicious grin curls at her lips.</p><p>I dodge to the right of the stairs and swerve around the side of the house before she can insult me. The sun is lowering below the lines of the mountains that encase the town and stars sparkle across the sky like dragonflies. It\u2019s hard to see once the lights of the front porch fade away and my shoe catches something sharp. I fall down and my palms split open against the gravel. Injuries on the outside are easy to endure and I get up without hesitation.</p><p>I dust the pebbles from my hands, wincing from the burn of the scratches as I round the corner into the backyard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit what the hell you were trying to do,\u201d a male voice cuts through the darkness. \u201cYou\u2019re such a fuck up. A fucking disappointment.\u201d</p><p>I halt by the edge of the grass. Near the back fence is a brick pool house where two figures stand below a dim light. One is taller, with their head hanging low and their broad shoulders are stooped over. The shorter one has a beer gut, a bald spot on the back of his head, and is standing in the other\u2019s face with their fists out in front of them. Squinting through the dark, I make out that the shorter one is Mr. Owens and the taller one is Kayden Owens. The situation is surprising since Kayden is very confident at school and has never been much of a target for violence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kayden mutters with a tremor in his voice as he hugs his hand against his chest. \u201cIt was an accident, sir. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the open back door where the lights are on, the music is loud, and people are dancing, shouting, laughing. Glasses clink together and I can feel the sexual tension bottled in the room from all the way out here. These are the kinds of places I avoid at all cost, because I can\u2019t breathe very well in them. I move up to the bottom step tentatively, hoping to disappear into the crowd unnoticed, find my brother, and get the hell out of here.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fucking tell me it was an accident!\u201d The voice rises, blazing with incomprehensible rage. There\u2019s a loud bang and then a crack, like bones splitting into pieces. Instinctively I whirl around just in time to see Mr. Owens smash his fist into Kayden\u2019s face. The crack makes my gut churn. He hits him again and again, not stopping even when Kayden crumples to the ground. \u201cLiars get punished Kayden.\u201d</p><p>I wait for Kayden to get back up, but he stays unmoving not even bothering to cover his face with his arms. His father kicks him in the stomach, in the face, his movements harder, showing no sign of an approaching end.</p><p>I react without thinking, a desire to save him burning so fiercely it washes all doubts from my mind. I run across the grass and through the leaves blowing in the air without a plan other than to interrupt. When I reach them, I\u2019m shaking and verging toward shock as it becomes clear the situation is larger than my mind originally grasped.</p><p>Mr. Owens\u2019 knuckles are gashed and blood drips onto the cement in front of the pool house. Kayden is on the ground, his cheekbone cut open like a crack in the bark of a tree. His eye is swollen shut, his lip is ruptured, and there is blood all over his face.</p><p>Their eyes move to me and I quickly point over my shoulder with a very unsteady finger. \u201cThere was someone looking for you in the kitchen,\u201d I say to Mr. Owens, thankful that for once my voice maintains steadiness. \u201cThey needed help with something... I can\u2019t remember what though.\u201d</p> <p>His sharp gaze pierces into me and I cower back at the anger and powerlessness in his eyes, like his rage controls him. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie Lawrence,\u201d I say quietly, noting the smell of liquor on his breath.</p><p>His gaze travels from my worn shoes to the heavy black jacket with buckles, and finally lands on my hair that barely brushes my chin. I look like a homeless person, but that\u2019s the point. I want to be unnoticed. \u201cOh, yeah, you're Coach Lawrence\u2019s daughter. I didn\u2019t recognize you in the dark.\u201d He glances down at the blood on his knuckles and then looks back at me. \u201cListen Callie, I didn\u2019t mean for this to happen. It was an accident.\u201d</p><p>I don't do well under pressure so I stand motionless, listening to my heart knock inside my chest. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go clean up,\u201d he mutters. His gaze bores into me for a brief moment before he stomps across the grass toward the back door with his injured hand clasped beside him.</p><p>I focus back on Kayden, releasing a breath trapped in my chest. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He cups his hand over his eye, stares at his shoes, and keeps his other hand against his chest, seeming vulnerable, weak, and perplexed. For a second, I picture myself on the ground with bruises and cuts that can only be seen from the inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d His voice is harsh, so I turn toward the house, ready to bolt.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d he calls out through the darkness.</p><p>I stop on the line of the grass and turn to meet his eyes. \u201cI did what anyone else would have done.\u201d</p><p>The eyebrow above his good eye dips down. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Kayden and I have gone to school together since we were in kindergarten. Sadly this is the longest conversation we\u2019ve had since about sixth grade when I was deemed the class weirdo. In the middle of the year, I showed up to school with my hair chopped off and wearing clothes that nearly swallowed me. After that, I lost all my friends. Even when our families have dinner together, Kayden pretends like he doesn\u2019t know me.</p><p>\"You did what almost no one would have done.\" Lowering his hand from his eye, he staggers to his feet and towers over me as he straightens his legs. He is the kind of guy girls have an infatuation for, including me back when I saw guys as something else other than a threat. His brown hair flips at his ears and neck, his usually perfect smile is a bloody mess, and only one of his emerald eyes is visible. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you did it.\u201d</p><p>I scratch at my forehead, my nervous habit when someone is really seeing me. \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t just walk away. I\u2019d never be able to forgive myself if I did.\u201d</p><p>The light from the house emphasizes the severity of his wounds and there is blood splattered all over his shirt. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone about this, okay? He\u2019s been drinking... and going through some stuff. He\u2019s not himself tonight.\u201d</p><p>I bite at my lip, unsure if I believe him. \u201cMaybe you should tell someone... like your mom.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me like I\u2019m a small, incompetent child. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell.\u201d</p><p>I eye his puffy face, his normally perfect features now distorted. \u201cAlright, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I want,\u201d he says dismissively and I start to walk away. \u201cHey Callie, it\u2019s Callie, right? Will you do me a favor?\u201d</p><p>I peer over my shoulder. \u201cSure. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the downstairs bathroom there\u2019s a first aid kit, and in the freezer there\u2019s an icepack. Would you go grab them for me? I don\u2019t want to go in until I\u2019ve cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m desperate to leave, but the pleading in his tone overpowers me. \u201cYes, I can do that.\u201d I leave him near the pool house to go inside where the very crowded atmosphere makes it hard to breathe. Tucking in my elbows and hoping no one will touch me, I weave through the people.</p><p>Maci Owens, Kayden\u2019s mother, is chatting with some of the other moms at the table and waves her hand at me, her gold and silver bangle bracelets jingling together. \u201cOh Callie, is your mom here, hun?\u201d Her speech is slurred and there is an empty bottle of wine in front of her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s out in the car,\u201d I call out over the music as someone bumps into my shoulder and my muscles stiffen. \u201cShe was on the phone with my dad and sent me in to find my brother. Have you seen him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry hun, I haven\u2019t.\u201d She motions her hand around with flourish. \u201cThere are just so many people here.\u201d</p><p>I give her a small wave. \u201cOkay, well, I\u2019m going to go look for him.\u201d As I walk away, I wonder if she\u2019s seen her husband and if she\u2019ll question the cut on his hand.</p><p>In the living room, my brother Jackson is sitting on the sofa, talking to his best friend, Caleb Miller. I freeze near the threshold, just out of their sight. They keep laughing and talking, drinking their beers, like nothing matters. I despise my brother for laughing, for being here, for making it so I have to go tell him mom is waiting out in the car.</p><p>I start toward him, but I can\u2019t get my feet to move. I know I need to get it over with, but there are people making out in the corners and dancing in the middle of the room and it\u2019s making me uncomfortable. I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t breathe. Move feet, move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Someone runs into me and it nearly knocks me to the floor.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d a deep voice apologizes.</p><p>I catch myself on the doorframe and it breaks my trance. I hurry down the hall without bothering to see who ran into me. I need to get out of this place and breathe again.</p><p>After I collect the first aid kit from the bottom cupboard and the icepack from the freezer, I take the long way out of the house, going through the side door unnoticed. Kayden\u2019s not outside anymore, but the interior light of the pool house filters from the windows.</p><p>Hesitantly, I push open the door and poke my head into the dimly lit room. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Kayden walks out from the back room without a shirt on and a towel pressed up to his face, which is bright red and lumpy. \u201cHey, did you get the stuff?\u201d</p><p>I slip into the room and shut the door behind me. I hold out the first aid kit and the icepack, with my head turned toward the door to avoid looking at him. His bare chest, and the way his jeans ride low on his hips smothers me with uneasiness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t bite, Callie.\u201d His tone is neutral as he takes the kit and the pack. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to stare at the wall.\u201d</p><p>I compel my eyes to look at him and it\u2019s hard not to stare at the scars that crisscross along his stomach and chest. The vertical lines that run down his forearms are the most disturbing, thick and jagged as if someone took a razor to his skin. I wish I could run my fingers along them and remove the pain and memories that are attached to them.</p><p>He quickly lowers the towel to cover himself up and confusion gleams from his good eye as we stare at one another. My heart throbs inside my chest as a moment passes, like a snap of a finger, yet it seems to go on forever.</p><p>He blinks and presses the pack to his inflamed eye while balancing the kit on the edge of the pool table. His fingers quiver as he pulls his hand back and each knuckle is scraped raw. \u201cCan you get the gauze out of that for me? My hand\u2019s a little sore.\u201d</p><p>As my fingers fumble to lift the latch, my fingernail catches in the crack, and it peels back. Blood pools out as I open the lid to retrieve the gauze. \u201cYou might need stitches on that cut below the eye. It looks bad.\u201d</p><p>He dabs the cut with the towel, wincing from the pain. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I just need to clean it up and get it covered.\u201d</p><p>The steaming hot water runs down my body, scorching my skin with red marks and blisters. I just want to feel clean again. I take the damp towel from him, careful not to let our fingers touch, and lean forward to examine the lesion, which is so deep the muscle and tissue is showing.</p><p>\u201cYou really need stitches.\u201d I suck the blood off my thumb. \u201cOr you\u2019re going to have a scar.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his lips tug up into a sad smile. \u201cI can handle scars, especially ones that are on the outside.\u201d</p><p>I understand his meaning from the depths of my heart. \u201cI really think you should have your mom take you to the doctor and then you can tell her what happened.\u201d</p><p>He starts to unwind a small section of gauze, but he accidentally drops it onto the floor. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen and even if it did, it wouldn\u2019t matter. None of this does.\u201d</p><p>With unsteady fingers, I gather up the gauze and unravel it around my hand. Tearing the end, I grab the tape out of the kit. Then squeezing every last terrified thought from my mind, I reach toward his cheek. He remains very still, hugging his sore hand against his chest as I place the gauze over the wound. His eyes stay on me, his brows knit, and he barely breathes as I tape it in place.</p><p>I pull back and an exhale eases out of my lips. He\u2019s the first person I\u2019ve intentionally touched outside my family for the last six years. \u201cI would still consider getting stitches.\u201d</p><p>He closes the kit and wipes a droplet of blood off the lid. \u201cDid you see my father inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d My phone beeps from my pocket and I read over the text message. \u201cI have to go. My mom\u2019s waiting out in the car. Are you sure you\u2019ll be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He doesn\u2019t glance up at me as he picks up the towel and heads toward the back room. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll see you later, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>No, you won\u2019t. Putting my phone away in my pocket, I depart for the door. \u201cYeah, I guess I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he instantly adds.</p><p>I pause with my hand on the doorknob. I feel terrible for leaving him, but I\u2019m too chicken to stay behind. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>He deliberates for an eternity and then exhales a sigh. \u201cFor getting me the first aid kit and icepack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d I walk out the door with a heavy feeling in my heart as another secret falls on top of it.</p><p>As the gravel driveway comes into view, my phone rings from inside my pocket. \u201cI\u2019m like two feet away,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cYour brother is out here and he needs to get home. He\u2019s got to be at the airport in eight hours.\u201d My mother\u2019s tone is anxious.</p><p>I increase my pace. \u201cSorry, I got sidetracked... but you sent me in to get him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he answered his text, now come on,\u201d she says frantically. \u201cHe needs to get some rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in like thirty seconds, Mom.\u201d I hang up as I step out into the front yard.</p><p>Daisy, Kayden\u2019s girlfriend, is out on the front porch, eating a slice of cake as she chats with Caleb Miller. My insides instantly knot, my shoulders slouch, and I shy into the shadows of the trees, hoping they won\u2019t see me.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, is that Callie Lawrence?\u201d Daisy says, shielding her eyes with her hand and squinting in my direction. \u201cWhat the heck are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be like hanging out at the cemetery or something?\u201d</p><p>I tuck my chin down and pick up the pace, stumbling over a large rock. One foot in front of the other.</p><p>\u201cOr are you just running away from the piece of cake I have?\u201d she yells with laughter in her tone. \u201cWhich one is it Callie? Come on, tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock it off,\u201d Caleb warns with a smirk on his face as he leans over the railing, his eyes as black as the night. \u201cI\u2019m sure Callie has her reasons for running away.\u201d</p><p>The insinuation in his voice sends my heart and legs fleeing. I run away into the darkness of the driveway with the sound of their laughter hitting my back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d My brother asks as I slam the car door and buckle my seatbelt, panting and fixing my short strands of hair back into place. \u201cWhy were you running?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom said to hurry.\" I fix my eyes on my lap.</p><p>\u201cI sometimes wonder about you, Callie.\u201d He rearranges his dark brown hair into place and slumps back in the seat. \u201cIt\u2019s like you go out of your way to make people think you\u2019re a freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a twenty-four year-old who\u2019s hanging around at a high school party,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>My mom narrows her eyes at me. \u201cCallie, don\u2019t start. You know Mr. Owens invited your brother, just like he invited you to the party.\u201d</p><p>My mind drifts back to Kayden, his face beaten and bruised. I feel horrible for leaving him and almost tell my mom what happened, but then I catch a glimpse of Caleb and Daisy on the front porch, watching us back away, and I remember that sometimes secrets need to be taken to the grave. Besides, my mom has never been one for wanting to hear about the ugly things in the world.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only twenty-three. I don\u2019t turn twenty-four until next month,\u201d My brother interrupts my thoughts. \u201cAnd they\u2019re not in high school anymore so shut your mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how old you are,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I'm not in high school either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to sound so happy about it,\u201d my mom grimaces as she spins the steering wheel to pull out onto the street. Wrinkles crease around her hazel eyes as she tries not to cry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to miss you and I really wish you\u2019d reconsider waiting until fall to go away to school. Laramie is almost six hours away sweetie. It\u2019s going to be so hard being that far away from you.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the road that stretches through the trees and over the shallow hills. \u201cSorry Mom, but I'm already enrolled. Besides, there\u2019s no point in me sticking around for the summer just to sit around in my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always get a job,\u201d she suggests. \u201cLike your brother does every summer. That way you can spend some time with him and Caleb is going to be staying with us.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in my body winds up like a knotted rope and I have to force oxygen into my lungs. \u201cSorry Mom, but I\u2019m ready to be on my own.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m more than ready. I\u2019m sick of the sad looks she always gives me because she doesn\u2019t understand anything I do. I\u2019m tired of wanting to tell her what happened, but knowing I can\u2019t. I\u2019m ready to be on my own, away from the nightmares that haunt my room, my life, my whole world.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>#4 Wear a shirt with color.</p><p>4 months later...</p><p>Callie</p><p>I often wonder what drives people to do things. Whether it\u2019s put into their minds at birth, or if it is learned as they grow. Maybe it\u2019s even forced upon them by circumstances that are out of their hands. Does anyone have control over their lives or are we all helpless?</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s like spazzville around here today,\u201d Seth comments, scrunching his nose at the arriving freshmen swarming the campus yard. Then he waves his hand in front of my face. \u201cAre you spacing off on me again?\u201d</p><p>I blink away from my thoughts. \u201cNow don\u2019t be arrogant.\u201d I nudge his shoulder with mine playfully. \u201cJust because we both decided to do the summer semester and we know where everything is, doesn\u2019t make us better than them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah, it kind of does.\u201d He rolls his honey brown eyes at me. \u201cWe\u2019re like the upper-class freshmen.\u201d</p><p>I press back a smile and sip my latte. \u201cYou know there\u2019s no such thing as an upper-class freshman.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, ruffling his golden blond locks, which look like he gets them highlighted in a salon, but they\u2019re actually natural. \u201cYeah, I know. Especially for people like you and me. We\u2019re like two black sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many more black sheep than you and me.\u201d I shield my eyes from the sun with my hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve toned it down. I\u2019m even wearing a red t-shirt today, like the list said to do.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his lips tug upward. \u201cWhich would look even better if you\u2019d let those pretty locks of yours down, instead of hiding them in that ponytail all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne step at a time,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was hard enough just letting my hair grow out. It makes me feel weird. And it doesn\u2019t matter because that has yet to be added to the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell it needs to be,\u201d he replies. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m doing it when I get back to my room.\u201d</p><p>Seth and I have a list of things we have to do, even if we\u2019re scared, repulsed, or incapable. If it\u2019s on the list, we have to do it and we have to cross off one thing at least once a week. It was something we did after we confessed our darkest secrets to each other, locked away in my room, during my first real bonding moment with a human being. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you still wear that God awful hoodie,\u201d he continues, jerking on the bottom of my grey faded jacket. \u201cI thought we talked about that hideous thing. You\u2019re beautiful and you don\u2019t need to cover up. Besides, it\u2019s like eighty degrees outside.\u201d</p><p>I wrap my jacket around myself self-consciously, gripping at the edge of the fabric. \u201cSubject change please.\u201d</p><p>He loops arms with mine as he leans his weight on me, forcing me to scoot over to the edge of the sidewalk as people pass by us. \u201cFine, but one day we\u2019re going to talk about a complete makeover, in which I will supervise.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>I met Seth my first day at UW during Pre-Calculus. Our inability to understand numbers was a great conversation starter and our friendship kind of grew from there. Seth is the only friend I\u2019ve really had since sixth grade, besides a brief friendship with the new girl in school who didn\u2019t know the \u201cAnorexic, Devil Worshipping Callie\u201d everyone else saw me as.</p><p>Seth abruptly stops walking and swings in front of me. He\u2019s wearing a grey t-shirt and a pair of black skinny jeans. His hair is stylishly tousled and his long eyelashes are the envy of every girl.</p><p>\u201cI just have to say one more thing.\u201d He touches the tip of his finger to the corner of my eye. \u201cI like the maroon eyeliner much better than the excessive black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have your approval on that.\u201d I press my hand dramatically to my heart. \u201cI\u2019m so relieved. It\u2019s been weighing on my mind since this morning.\u201d</p><p>He makes a face and his eyes scroll down my red t-shirt that brushes the top of my form-fitting jeans. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great in every department, I just wish you\u2019d wear a dress or shorts or something for once and show off those legs of yours.\u201d</p><p>My face plummets along with my mood. \u201cSeth, you know why... I mean, you know... I can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m just trying to be encouraging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are and that\u2019s why I love you.\u201d I love him for more than that actually. I love him because he's the first person I felt comfortable enough with to tell my secrets to, but maybe that\u2019s because he understands what it\u2019s like to be hurt inside and out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so much happier than when I first met you.\u201d He tucks my bangs behind my ear. \u201cI wish you could be this way around everyone, Callie. That you would stop hiding from everyone. It\u2019s sad no one gets to see how great you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd vice-versa,\u201d I say, because Seth hides as much as I do.</p><p>He takes my empty Styrofoam cup from my hand and tosses it into a garbage can beside one of the benches. \u201cWhat do you think? Should we hit up one of the tours and make fun of the tour guide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the way to my heart.\u201d I beam and his laughter lights up his entire face.</p><p>We stroll up the sidewalk in the shade of the trees toward the front doors of the main office, which is a few stories high with a peaked roof. It has a historical look to it, tan brick with a lot of wear and tear, like it belongs in an older era. The yard that centers all the buildings looks like a triangular maze with randomly placed concrete paths that cross the lawn. It\u2019s a pretty place to go to school, lots of trees, and open space, but it took some getting used to.</p><p>There is confusion in the air as students and parents attempt to find their way around. I\u2019m completely distracted when I hear a faint, \u201cHeads up.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps up just in time to see a guy running straight for me with his hands in the air and a football flying at him. His solid body collides with mine and I fall flat onto my back, cracking my head and elbow against the pavement. Pain erupts through my arm and I can\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cGet off me,\u201d I say, writhing my body in a panic. The weight and heat off him makes me feel like I\u2019m drowning. \u201cGet off now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He rolls to the side and quickly climbs off me. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>I blink the spots away from my eyes until his face comes into focus; brown hair that flips up at the ears, piercing emerald eyes, and a smile that will melt a girl\u2019s heart. \u201cKayden?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrow and his hand falls to his side. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d There\u2019s a small scar below his right eye and I wonder if it\u2019s from where his dad hit him that night.</p> <p>A tiny prickle forms in my heart that he can\u2019t remember who I am. Getting to my feet, I brush the dirt and grass off my sleeves. \u201cUm, no, sorry. I thought you were someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you got the name right.\u201d His tone carries doubt as he scoops the football off the grass. \u201cWait, I do know you, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for getting in your way.\u201d I snag Seth\u2019s hand and haul him toward the entrance doors where there\u2019s a big \u201cWelcome Students\u201d banner.</p><p>When we\u2019re in the corridor by the glass display cases, I let go of him and lean against the brick wall, catching my breath. \u201cThat was Kayden Owens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He glances back at the entrance as students swarm inside. \u201cThe Kayden Owens? The one you saved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t save him,\u201d I clarify. \u201cI just interrupted something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething that was about to get ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone would have done the same thing.\u201d</p><p>His fingers seize my elbow as I attempt to walk down the hall and he pulls me back to him. \u201cNo, a lot of people would have walked by. It\u2019s a common fact that a lot of people will turn their heads in the other direction when something bad is happening. I know this from experience.\u201d</p><p>My heart aches for him and what he went through. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, Callie,\u201d he says with a heavy-hearted sigh. \u201cYou have your own sad story.\u201d</p><p>We make our way down the slender hallway until it opens up and there is a table stacked with flyers and pamphlets on it. People are standing in line, staring at schedules, talking to their parents, looking scared and excited.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even recognize you,\u201d he comments as he works through the crowd to the front of the line, cutting in front of everyone, and he grabs a pink flyer.</p><p>\u201cHe barely recognized me ever,\u201d I shake my head when he offers me a cookie from a plate on the table.</p><p>\u201cWell, he should recognize you now.\u201d He picks up a sugar cookie, scrapes the sprinkles off, and bites off the corner. Crumbs fall from his lips as he chews. \u201cYou did save his ass from getting beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u201d I say, even though it does stab at my heart a little. \u201cNow, can we please change the subject to something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a big deal.\u201d He sighs when I frown at him. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut. Now come on, let\u2019s go find a tour guide to torture.\u201d</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I\u2019ve been haunted by a nightmare every single God damn night for the last four months. I\u2019m curled up near the pool house and my dad\u2019s beating the shit out of me. He\u2019s madder than I\u2019ve ever seen him, probably because I did one of the worst things imaginable to him. There\u2019s murder in his eyes and every ounce of humanity is gone, consumed by rage.</p><p>As his fist hammers against my face, warm blood pours along my skin and splatters against his shirt. I know this time he\u2019s probably going to kill me and I should finally fight back, but I was taught to die on the inside. Plus I just don\u2019t seem to care anymore.</p><p>Then someone appears from the shadows and interrupts us. When I wipe the blood from my eyes, I realize it\u2019s a girl terrified out of her mind. I don\u2019t quite understand it, why she intervened, but I owe her a lot.</p><p>Callie Lawrence saved my fucking life that night, more than she probably realized. I wish she knew, but I never could figure out how to tell her, nor have I seen her since it happened. I heard she went off to college early to start her life and I envy her.</p><p>My first day on campus is going pretty well, especially after my mom and dad left. Once they drove away, I could breathe for the very first time in my life.</p><p>Luke and I wander around the busy campus trying to figure out where everything is, while tossing a football back and forth. The sun is bright, the trees are green, and there\u2019s so much newness in the air it gets me pumped up. I want to start over, be happy, live for once.</p><p>On a particularly long throw, I end up running over a girl. I feel like an asshole, especially because she\u2019s so small and fragile looking. Her blue eyes are enlarged and she looks scared to death. What\u2019s even weirder is she knows me, but takes off running when I question how she does.</p><p>It\u2019s bugging the hell out of me. I can\u2019t stop thinking about her face and the familiarity. Why can\u2019t I figure out who the hell she is?</p><p>\u201cDid you see that girl?\u201d I ask Luke. He\u2019s been my best friend since second grade when we both realized how mutually screwed up our home lives were, although for different reasons.</p><p>\u201cThe one you just ran over?\u201d He folds up the schedule and tucks it into his back pocket of his jeans. \u201cShe kind of reminds me of that quiet girl we used to go to school with\u2014the one Daisy was dead set on torturing.\u201d</p><p>My eyes move to the entrance doors where she disappeared. \u201cCallie Lawrence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I think that was her name.\u201d He blows out a stressed breath as he turns around in the middle of the lawn trying to get his bearings. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s her. She wasn\u2019t wearing all that black shit around her eyes and Callie had a haircut that made her look like a guy. Plus, I think that girl was thinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she did look different.\u201d But if it is Callie, I need to talk to her about that night. \u201cCallie was always thin, though. That\u2019s why Daisy made fun of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was one of the reasons she made fun of her,\u201d he reminds me and his face twists with repulsion at something behind me. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go find our room.\u201d Luke hurries off toward the corner of the school building before I can say anything.</p><p>\u201cThere you are.\u201d Daisy comes up from behind me and I\u2019m overwhelmed by the smell of perfume and hairspray.</p><p>Suddenly I understand why Luke ran off like there was a fire. He doesn\u2019t like Daisy for many reasons; one being that he thinks Daisy is a bitch. And she is, but it works for me because she allows me to stay detached from feeling anything, which is the only way I know how to live life.</p><p>\u201cI sure hope you weren\u2019t just talking about me.\u201d Daisy wraps her arms around my mid-section and massages my stomach with her fingertips. \u201cUnless it was something good.\u201d</p><p>I turn around and kiss her forehead. She\u2019s wearing a low-cut blue dress and the necklace that rests between her tits. \u201cNo one was talking about you. Luke just went to find his room.\u201d</p><p>She bites down on her glossy lip and bats her eyelashes at me. \u201cGood, because I\u2019m already nervous about leaving my ridiculously hot boyfriend. Remember you can flirt, but you can\u2019t touch.\u201d Daisy gets bored easily and says things to start drama.</p><p>\u201cNo touching. Got it,\u201d I say, holding back an eye roll. \u201cAnd again, no one was talking about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She twines a strand of her curly blond hair around her finger with a thoughtful expression on her face. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if you talk about me, just as long as it\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>I met Daisy when I was in tenth grade and she moved to our school. She was the hot new freshman and was very aware that she was. I was pretty popular, but hadn\u2019t really dated anyone, just messed around. I was more focused on football, like my dad wanted me to be. Daisy seemed interested, though, and a couple of weeks later, we were officially a couple. She\u2019s self-involved and she never asks where all my bruises, cuts, and scars come from. She brought it up once, the first time we fucked, and I told her it was from a four-wheeling accident when I was a kid. She didn\u2019t question the fresh ones.</p><p>\u201cLook baby, I got to go.\u201d I give her a quick kiss on the lips. \u201cI have to check in and unpack and figure out where the hell everything is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fine.\u201d She pouts out her bottom lip and runs her fingers through my hair, guiding my lips back to hers for a deep kiss. When she pulls away, she smiles. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll go back home and try to fill up my time with boring old high school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d I say to her as I back toward the doors, maneuvering between the people flooding the sidewalk. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for homecoming.\u201d</p><p>She waves as she turns for the parking lot. I keep my eyes on her until she\u2019s in her car and then I go into the school. The air is cooler inside, the lights are faint, and there\u2019s a lot of shouting and disorganization.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need a tour.\u201d I walk up to Luke, who\u2019s standing near the signup table, reading a pink flyer. \u201cAnd weren\u2019t you going to find your room or was that your excuse to escape Daisy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl drives me fucking crazy.\u201d He rakes his hand through his short, brown hair. \u201cAnd I was headed there, but then I realized it\u2019d be much easier if I went on a tour so I know where everything is.\u201d</p><p>Luke is a very structured person when it comes to school and sports. It makes sense to me since I know about his past, but from an outsider\u2019s point of view, he probably looks like a troublemaker, who failed out of school.</p> <p>\u201cFine, we\u2019ll do the tour.\u201d I write our names down on the paper and the red head sitting behind the table smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cYou can go join the one starting now,\u201d she says shamelessly pushing her cleavage up with her arms as she leans forward. \u201cThey just stepped into the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Grinning at her, I strut off with Luke toward where she directed us.</p><p>\u201cEvery time,\u201d he says amusedly as he sidesteps around a smaller table with plates full of cookies on it. \u201cYou\u2019re like a magnet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ask for it,\u201d I reply as we approach the back of the crowd. \u201cIn fact, I wish they\u2019d stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t,\u201d he states with a roll of his eyes. \u201cYou love it and you know it. And I wished you\u2019d act on it, so you could ditch the bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDaisy\u2019s not that bad. She\u2019s probably the only girl who doesn\u2019t care if I flirt.\u201d I cross my arms and stare at the nerdy tour guide with thick glasses, scraggily brown hair, and a clipboard in his hands. \u201cDo we really need to do this? I\u2019d rather go unpack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to know where everything is,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can go to the room if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine here.\u201d My eyes zone in on a girl across the crowd; the one I ran over. She\u2019s smiling at a guy next to her who\u2019s whispering something in her ear. I find myself entertained by the naturalness of it, no pretenses like the one\u2019s I\u2019m used to seeing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Luke tracks my gaze and his forehead creases. \u201cYou know what? I think that might be Callie Lawrence. Now that I think about it, I remember her dad mentioning something about her going to UW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way... it can't be... is it?\u201d I take in her brown hair, her clothes that show her thin frame, and her blue eyes that sparkle as she laughs. The last time I saw her, those blue eyes were clouded and weighted. The Callie I knew held more darkness, wore baggy clothes, and always looked sad. She shied away from everyone, except for that one night when she saved my ass.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s her,\u201d Luke says with confidence as he flicks his finger against his temple. \u201cRemember she had that small birthmark on her temple just like that girl does. It can't be a freakish coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d I say loudly and everyone looks at me.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d the tour guide asks in an icy tone.</p> <p>I shake my head, noticing Callie is staring at me. \u201cSorry man, I thought a bee landed on me.\u201d</p><p>Luke snorts a laugh and I suppress my laughter. The tour guide huffs in frustration and continues his speech about where all the offices are as he points at each door.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that about?\u201d Luke asks in a low voice as he folds a paper neatly in half.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I skim the crowd, but Callie\u2019s nowhere. \u201cDid you see where she went?\u201d</p><p>Luke shakes his head. \u201cNope.\"</p><p>My eyes travel across the hallway, but there\u2019s no sign of her anywhere. I need to find her, so I can thank her for saving my life, like I should have done four months ago.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>#27 Invite Someone You Don\u2019t Know to Dinner.</p><p>Callie</p><p>\u201cWhat are our plans for tonight?\u201d I fold up a shirt and place it into the laundry basket on top of the dryer. \u201cAre we going out or staying in?\u201d</p><p>Seth hops onto one of the washing machines with his legs dangling over the edge as he pops a piece of gum into his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m conflicted. On one hand, I want to stay in and catch up on The Vampire Diaries, but there\u2019s this really awesome restaurant I\u2019ve been wanting to try out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw, not that one with the Sushi Bar.\u201d I frown, pulling a flimsy sheet of fabric softener off one of my shirts. \u201cI don\u2019t like Sushi and I don\u2019t really feel like eating out tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve never had Sushi,\u201d he corrects. \u201cAnd just because you haven\u2019t tried something doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like it.\u201d He stifles a laugh by sealing his lips together. \u201cI know this from my own factual evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d My phone vibrates as it lights up from on top of the stack of shirts. \u201cDang it, it\u2019s my mom. Give me a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Mom,\u201d I answer, shuffling to the corner to get away from the rattle of the washing machines.</p><p>\u201cHi, baby girl,\u201d she says. \u201cHow\u2019s your first day of classes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst day of class is on Monday,\u201d I remind her, pushing my fingertip against my ear to block out the rattle of the machines. \u201cToday\u2019s just the day when everyone\u2019s checking in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how\u2019s that going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already know where everything is, so I\u2019m catching up on my laundry with Seth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Lawrence,\u201d Seth shouts, cupping his hands around his mouth.</p><p>\u201cTell him hi for me, honey, okay?\u201d she replies. \u201cAnd that I can\u2019t wait to meet him.\u201d</p><p>I cover the receiver with my hand. \u201cShe can\u2019t wait to meet you,\u201d I whisper to Seth and he rolls his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell her she can\u2019t handle me.\u201d The washing machine stops and he jumps off to open the lid.</p><p>\u201cHe says he can\u2019t wait to meet you either,\u201d I tell my mom. \u201cIn fact, he\u2019s really excited.\u201d</p><p>Seth shakes his head, tugging a jacket out of the machine. \u201cMoms are not my thing. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d my mom wonders.</p><p>\u201cNothing mom.\u201d The dryer beeps. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019ll call you later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on sweetie. I just want to say that you sound really happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d I lie through a thick throat, because I know that\u2019s what she wants to hear.</p><p>Seth drops his hang-dry only shirt on the edge of the basket, puts his hands on his hips, and narrows his eyes at me. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to your mother, Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d my mother asks. \u201cI can hear a bunch of noises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d I press the end button before she can say anything else.</p><p>\u201cMy mom is not like your mom.\u201d I open the dryer door and scoop the rest of my clothes out with my arms. \u201cFor the most part, she\u2019s nice. Well, at least when I\u2019m behaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can\u2019t tell her things\u2014really important things.\u201d He flexes his arm that was in a cast when I met him. \u201cJust like my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told your mom.\u201d I bump the dryer door shut with my hip. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t go well and I don\u2019t tell my mom, because it will crush her. She\u2019s such a happy person there\u2019s no use cursing her with dark thoughts.\u201d I drop the clothes into the basket as one of the washing machines chugs and bangs against the cement wall. \u201cWe can try that new restaurant, if you really, really want.\u201d Picking up the basket, I prop it against my hip. \u201cI\u2019ll add it to my list of new things I\u2019m going to try.\u201d</p><p>He grins from ear to ear. \u201cI love that list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do too... sometimes,\u201d I agree as he gathers a stack of clothes. \u201cAnd you were brilliant for thinking of it.\u201d</p><p>The list was made in the shadows of my dorm room when he admitted to me how he broke his arm and where the scars on his hands came from. He\u2019d been walking home from his last day of school and a bunch of football players had drove up in a truck. They jumped him, beat him, and tried to break him into a thousand pieces that they could dust under the rug. But Seth is strong, which is why I told him my secret, because he knows what it\u2019s like to have something ripped away from you. Although I omitted the gory details because I couldn\u2019t say them aloud.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a very brilliant man.\u201d He steps aside to let me through the doorway first. \u201cAnd as long as you hold onto that notion, you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>We laugh and it\u2019s real, but a dark cloud hovers over us once the sound is stolen by the wind.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>\u201cThis room is the size of a box,\u201d I remark, taking in the very small dorm room. We\u2019re in the Downey residence hall, one of the four buildings they stuff the freshmen into. There are two twin size beds and a desk in the far corner. I can cover the space between the beds in two strides and the closet on the far wall barely holds three boxes. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to get an apartment? I saw some that are really close to campus on my way in.\u201d</p><p>Luke rummages through a large box labeled \u201cJunk.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t afford an apartment. I need to find a job just so I can buy my books and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scholarship didn\u2019t pay for that?\u201d I grab a heavy box and drop it onto the mattress of my bed.</p><p>He balls up some tape and throws it on the floor. \u201cThat only covered tuition.\u201d</p><p>I peel the tape off the top of the box. \u201cI can help out... if you need some extra cash.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shakes his head quickly with his attention immersed in a box. \u201cI\u2019m not a charity case. If you want an apartment, then go get one. You don\u2019t have to stay in the dorms just because I am.\u201d He pulls out a headless bronze statue and his face reddens. \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t pack your boxes man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I did and I didn\u2019t put this in there.\u201d He chucks it across the room and it dents the wall. \u201cGod fucking dammit, she\u2019s trying to mess with my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let your mom get to you. You know she\u2019s just trying to get you to come home so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with things on her own.\u201d I pick up the broken statue and step out into the hall to toss it in the garbage just outside the room.</p><p>On my way back, I spot Callie walking in my direction with the guy she was with earlier and she\u2019s smiling again. I pause in the middle of the hallway and wait for her to reach me, forcing the traffic of people to move around me. She doesn\u2019t notice me, but her friend sees me and he whispers something in her ear.</p><p>Her head whips in my direction and she stumbles back like she\u2019s afraid I\u2019m going to attack her. Her friend puts his hand on the small of her back in a comforting gesture.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d I start off awkwardly, thrown off by her skittishness toward me. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember you,\u201d she interrupts, her blue eyes flickering to the scar on my cheekbone. \u201cHow could I not remember you? We\u2019ve known each other since we were kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say, unsure how to respond to her offish attitude. She didn\u2019t act this way that night. \u201cThat was just my way of starting the conversation.\u201d</p><p>Her lips form an \u2018O,\u2019 then she stands silently, fidgeting with the strap on her oversized jacket.</p><p>Her friend glances at her and then extends his hand toward me. \u201cI\u2019m Seth.\u201d</p><p>I shake his hand with my gaze still on Callie. \u201cKayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive Callie.\u201d Seth gently pats her shoulder and she winces. \u201cShe\u2019s feeling a little off today.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s eyelids descend as she narrows her eyes at him. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. I feel fine.\u201d</p><p>Seth presses her with a relenting look and grits through his teeth, \u201cThen maybe you should say something. Perhaps something nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She focuses her attention back to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry... I mean...\u201d she trails off, cursing under her breath, \u201cOh my God, what is wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>Seth sighs, like he\u2019s used to her awkward behavior. \u201cYou\u2019re just starting school today?\u201d he asks me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m here on a football scholarship.\u201d I eye him up, questioning if he\u2019s ever touched a football.</p><p>He arches his eyebrows, rocking back on his heels, feigning interest. \u201cAw, I see.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s bangs flutter away from her forehead as she lets out a slow exhale. \u201cWe have to go. We have dinner plans. It was nice talking to you, Kayden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come with us,\u201d Seth offers, ignoring the glare Callie targets at him. \u201cIf you want. It\u2019s just this new place we\u2019re going to check out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sushi.\u201d Callie meets my gaze for the first time. Sadness and diffidence possess her pupils and I almost reach out to hug her pain away. It\u2019s an odd feeling, since I\u2019ve never hugged anyone, other than Daisy and I only hug her when I have to. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Sushi.\u201d I look over my shoulder at the open door to my dorm. \u201cBut I\u2019d have to bring Luke, if that\u2019s okay? Luke was the running back for the Broncos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know who he is.\u201d She swallows hard. \u201cHe can come, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a second. Let me see if he\u2019s up for it.\u201d I duck back into the room where Luke is sitting on his unmade bed, sifting through a stack of papers. I brace my hands on the doorframe as I stick my head in. \u201cAre you down for some Sushi?\u201d</p><p>His eyes elevate from the papers to me. \u201cSushi? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Callie Lawrence just invited us,\u201d I say. \u201cOr well, her friend did... do you remember her being offish?\u201d</p><p>He tucks the papers away into a dresser drawer, but crumples up a small one and throws it into the trash. \u201cYeah, she got that way around sixth grade. It was like one minute she was normal and then the next minute she was fucking weird.\u201d</p><p>My hands fall to my side and I lean back, glancing out into the hall at Callie who\u2019s whispering something to Seth. \u201cI don\u2019t remember that. I mean, I remember her being kind of normal and then not really remembering her at all. She didn\u2019t really hang out with anyone, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the obsession with her now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an obsession.\u201d He pisses me off with the accusation. \u201cI don\u2019t ever get obsessed with anyone. They just offered and I accepted to be polite. If you don\u2019t want to go, then we don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>He stuffs his wallet into his back pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t care if we go. If I can make it through tons of freaking dinners with Daisy, I\u2019m sure I can make it through a dinner with some girl we went to school with that barely says a word.\u201d</p><p>I feel like an asshole. He seems to remember more about Callie than I do and I should know the girl who saved me in so many ways that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to explain it to her.</p><p>Callie</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so mad at you,\u201d I hiss under my breath at Seth as we walk across the dark parking lot toward the restaurant that\u2019s lit up by florescent lights. The four of us drove to the restaurant in the same car and the silence was enough to make me want to pull my hair out. \u201cWhy did you invite them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be polite.\u201d He shrugs and swings his arm around me. \u201cNow relax, my lovely Callie, and let\u2019s cross off being more social from our list. In fact, we can cross off inviting someone to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to burn that list when we get back.\u201d I jerk the glass doors open and step through the doorway into the stuffy atmosphere of the restaurant. Most of the booths are empty, but the bar is rather loud, with a group of girls wearing feather boas and tiaras, like they are at a bridal party.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Now relax and try to make small conversation,\u201d he replies and struts up to the hostess, resting his arm on top of the counter. \u201cHi, are there any seats available at the bar?\u201d</p><p>She giggles, twisting a lock of her red hair around her finger as she scrolls through a list, completely smitten by Seth. \u201cLet me check.\u201d</p><p>Seth pops a mint into his mouth and rolls his eyes at me from over his shoulder. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>I smile at him then turn toward Luke and Kayden, but can\u2019t find anything to say. I don\u2019t do well with guys, except for Seth. I wish I did, but my memories just won\u2019t let me.</p><p>Luke plucks a waxy leaf off the artificial plant near the door. \u201cI thought Laramie was supposed to be more of a party town then it seems to be.\u201d</p><p>I point at the window to my right. \u201cIt is farther down that way. There\u2019s a lot of clubs and stuff.\u201d</p><p>With his buzzed brown hair, a tattoo around his forearm, and intense brown eyes, Luke always looks like he\u2019s about to start a fight and it makes me want to cower back. \u201cSo you know where they are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of where they are.\u201d I peek out of the corner of my eye at Kayden. He\u2019s listening to me intently as he leans against the door with his arms crossed over his chest. Why is he looking at me like that? Like he\u2019s actually seeing me. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t been to many of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you were never really a party girl, were you?\u201d Luke flicks the leaf to the floor.</p><p>\u201cActually she kind of was at one time,\u201d Kayden intervenes with a proud expression on his face. \u201cI remember now. It was the beginning of sixth grade and my mom was supposed to bring the cake, but she forgot or something... I think it was your birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was turning twelve.\u201d My voice is breathless as the images of balloons, confetti, and pink frosting surface, but then bleed away into a pool of blood. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t make me a party girl, just a little girl who wanted a birthday party... that\u2019s all I wanted.\u201d</p><p>They stare at me like I\u2019ve lost my mind and I try to mentally summon my lips to form words, but they are bound together by the painful memories crushing my heart.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I got us a table, but it\u2019s not at the bar.\u201d Seth strolls up and drapes his arm around my shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? You look sick.\u201d</p><p>I blink several times and then force a smile. \u201cI\u2019m just tired.\u201d</p><p>He knows I\u2019m lying, but won\u2019t bring it up in front of Kayden or Luke. \u201cThen we should probably get you back early.\u201d</p><p>The hostess ushers us to our table and leaves the menus for us to look over, along with four glasses of ice water, flaunting Seth a grin before she heads back to the front. My vision is clouded by dark thoughts I\u2019ve tried not to think about in a while, and I can\u2019t see a single word on the list. I press the palms of my hands to my eyes and blink.</p><p>\u201cI think I need to admit something,\u201d Kayden announces. When I glance up at him, a slow grin turns up at his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t like Sushi. In fact, it kind of creeps me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I agree with a timid smile. \u201cIt\u2019s weird that it\u2019s not cooked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never had it,\u201d Seth divulges, turning the page of his menu. \u201cSo technically, she can\u2019t put in her opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she can offer her opinion.\u201d From beneath the table, Kayden\u2019s knee brushes mine, whether accidental or not, I\u2019m unsure. It sends a hot flow of heat up my body that makes my stomach somersault. \u201cIt seems like a valuable opinion.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to take his compliment, so I keep my lips fastened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not valuable,\u201d Seth explains. \u201cOnly that she may like it if she tried it. A code that I live by.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m sipping my water and I snort a laugh, choking on a piece of ice. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>Seth pats my back with his hand. \u201cAre you going to make it?\u201d</p><p>I nod, pressing my palm to my chest. \u201cYeah, no more jokes while I\u2019m drinking, though, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I live by.\u201d There\u2019s a sparkle in his eyes as he grins devilishly at me. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tone it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, I left my phone in the car,\u201d Luke slaps his hand on top of the table and our water glasses shake. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He gets up from the booth, strolls down the aisle, and exits out the front doors.</p><p>We return to our menus when Seth jumps up from the booth. \u201cI locked the car. He can\u2019t even get inside it.\u201d He rushes off toward the door, taking his keys out of his pocket.</p><p>\u201cLuke actually went to smoke,\u201d Kayden tells me, spinning the saltshaker between the palms of his hands. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t like to admit it to people he doesn\u2019t know. He\u2019s weird about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I bob my head up and down, not looking at him. \u201cSo did Seth, probably. He usually does it in the car, but he was being polite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have.\u201d Kayden laughs and it lights up his eyes. \u201cLuke\u2019s been smoking in my car since we were sixteen.\u201d</p><p>Unable to help myself, I smile at the idea as I fiddle with the edge of a napkin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Kayden folds his arms on top of the table and the bottom of his sleeves rise up. Tiny white lines cover the back of his wrists and he swiftly jerks his sleeves down to hide them. \u201cCome on, share whatever\u2019s making you smile like that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I raise my gaze back to him. \u201cI was just thinking about what my dad would have said if he ever found out his running back was a smoker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he knew he was.\u201d Kayden leans over the table, moving closer to me. \u201cHe always seemed to know everything that we did wrong, but never said it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe he did, I guess. He did catch my brother smoking once and grounded him for a very long time.\u201d Why am I talking to him like this? It\u2019s not like me. I tip my chin down and concentrate on the list of appetizers.</p><p>\u201cCallie, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says abruptly, flattening his palm on the table as he glides it toward mine. As his fingers brush my knuckles, I nearly choke to death.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I sound strangled.</p> <p>\u201cFor not saying thank you... for that night.\u201d He covers his big hand on top of mine.</p><p>For a second, I like how his warmth feels, but then I\u2019m thrown back to the place locked inside my mind, trapped and powerless.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I yank my hand away and hide it under the table. My pulse races as I stare at the menu. \u201cYou were having a rough night.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t say anything as he moves his hand away. I don\u2019t look up at him, because I don\u2019t want to see the disgusted look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf I asked them if I could have a hamburger, do you think they\u2019d make me one?\u201d he asks, nonchalantly changing the subject.</p><p>I flip the page of the menu, with my eyebrows furrowed. \u201cDoes it say they have hamburgers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I was kidding.\u201d He observes me from across the table. \u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>I nod warily. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come you left for college early?\u201d he asks. \u201cMost people want to stay home for the summer and party.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have anything left for me there except for my parents and it just seemed like it was time to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have a lot of friends, did you?\u201d Recollection masks his face as he starts to put the pieces of my sad life together.</p><p>Thankfully, Seth and Luke join us at the table before he can try to dig up more details. They smell like smoke and look euphorically happy.</p><p>\u201cNah, they don\u2019t really have many on campus.\u201d Seth says to Luke as he sits down and unrolls the napkin from around the silverware. \u201cAnd if they do, security usually breaks them up.\u201d</p><p>Luke swivels a small plastic display with pictures of the beer beverages on it. \u201cYeah, that shit happened all the time at our school. Like this one time we had this huge bonfire, and the cops showed up and busted everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of trouble did you get in?\u201d Seth asks, checking the watch on his wrist.</p><p>\u201cNot too much.\u201d Luke pops a toothpick into his mouth. \u201cThe cops in our town usually go easy on football players.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures,\u201d Seth mutters, giving me a sidelong glance, and I offer him a sympathetic smile.</p><p>Kayden\u2019s foot keeps bumping mine from below the table and I want to ask him to stop, but I can\u2019t even make eye contact with him. I grow flustered because part of me likes it. I\u2019m losing control over my feelings and I desperately need to get a hold of them again.</p><p>The waitress returns and jots down our orders. I try to do my best and order a whole meal with the intention to eat it all. When the food arrives however, my stomach clenches, and I can tell right away that I\u2019m going to do it, just like I always do.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>#52 Take a Chance For God\u2019s Sake</p><p>Kayden</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since school started. Classes are a pain in the ass. I was warned that college would be harder, but I never prepared myself for how much solo work was required. Between that and practice, I\u2019ve had zero time to focus on anything else in my life.</p><p>I\u2019ve crossed paths with Callie twice since we ate at the restaurant and each time she avoids me. She\u2019s in my Biology class, but sits in the back, as far away from anyone else as she can, focusing on her pen and paper. The girl has to have a whole notebook full of notes with how fixated she is with them.</p><p>I try not to stare at her, but most of the time I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s fascinating to watch how oblivious she is to everyone. It would be nice to get lost in my thoughts, instead of always worrying about shit.</p><p>I\u2019m getting ready to go to class, telling myself that I need to leave Callie alone, when I get a phone call from my dad.</p><p>\u201cYou left your shit in the garage,\u201d is the first thing he says to me.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I apologize, forcing myself to breathe as I grab my books. \u201cBut I thought mom said I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom has no say in these things,\u201d he says sharply. \u201cIf you wanted to keep your shit here, you should have asked me. God, how many times do you have to screw up before you stop?\"</p><p>I want to argue, but he\u2019s right. I screw up more than I don\u2019t. I let him chew my ass off for over fifteen minutes, and he makes me feel like a fucking kid again.</p><p>After I hang up, I stare at the mirror above the dresser, analyzing every scar on my face until it just looks like one big scar. Suddenly, all this anger pours out of me and I kick the shit out of the dresser until one of the drawers falls out. Luke\u2019s stuff scatters all over the floor; lighters, photos, a few tools, and a razorblade. He hates it when his shit gets disorganized and is going to go nuts if he comes back to this mess.</p><p>I quickly put everything back inside, trying to make it look orderly, and pretend not to notice the white elephant staring me in the face as I scoop it up off the floor. But it\u2019s all I can think about as I hold it in my palm, begging myself not to use it.</p><p>My hand shakes as my mind drifts back to a time when I wasn\u2019t like this; where I thought that maybe, just maybe, everything didn\u2019t have to center around pain.</p><p>My older brother, Tyler and I were messing around in the garage. He was about sixteen and I was eight. He was working on a motorcycle he had bought with the money he\u2019d saved up from his summer job.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s kind of a piece of shit,\u201d he said to me as he grabbed a wrench from the toolbox in the corner. \u201cBut it\u2019ll get me places\u2014away from here, which is all I fucking want.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been fighting with my dad all day and had a giant bruise on his arm and cuts on his knuckles. I\u2019d heard them arguing and then they were hitting each other. It was normal though. Life.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want to leave?\u201d I asked, wandering around the bike. It wasn\u2019t shiny or anything, but it looked like it could be fun. And if it could take anyone away from here, then it had to be something special. \u201cIs it because of dad?\u201d</p><p>He tossed the tool back into the box rather hard and raked his hands through his long brown hair, which made him look like a homeless person, or at least my dad said so. \u201cOne day, buddy, when you get a little bit older, you\u2019re going to realize that everything in this house is one fucking big lie and you\u2019re going to want to get the hell away from here, no matter what it costs.\u201d</p><p>I stepped up on a crate and climbed on top of the bike, grabbing onto the handles as I swung my short leg over it. \u201cWill you take me with you? I want to leave too.\u201d</p><p>He rounded to the back of the bike, squatting down to check the tires. \u201cYeah, buddy, I will.\u201d</p><p>I pushed the throttle, pretending to drive away, and for a second I saw the possibility of a life without pain. \u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>He nodded as he messed with the air pressure gauge. \u201cYeah, I promise.\u201d</p><p>It turned out my brother was a liar just like everyone else in the house. He ended up moving out, and leaving me behind because he\u2019d rather be drunk then deal with life. A few years later, my other brother, Dylan, graduated and moved out of the house. He changed his number, never told anyone where he was going, and no one has heard from him since, although I\u2019m not sure how hard anyone looked.</p><p>I was twelve at the time and the only kid left in the house, which meant I was the main focus of my dad\u2019s rage, something he made clear to me the night Dylan packed his shit and left. The beatings before that weren\u2019t too severe; slaps across the face, lashings with his belt, and sometimes he would punch us or kick us, but would hold back just enough that it hurt like hell but could be hidden.</p><p>I watched Dylan pull away from the driveway and drive down the road into the dark, pressing my face to the window, wishing I were in the car with him, even though Dylan and I had never been close. My dad walked in from outside, bringing in the cold night air with him. He\u2019d yelled at Dylan all the way to the car, telling him he was a fucking moron for giving up his football scholarship and refusing to be on the team.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you looking at?\u201d He slammed the front door so hard the family portrait above the mantle fell to the floor.</p><p>I turned around on the couch and sat down, staring at the portrait on the floor. \u201cNothing sir.\u201d</p><p>He stalked toward me, his pupils swallowing his eyes, and I could smell the alcohol on his breath from clear across the room. He was bigger than me, stronger than me, and he had a look on his face that let me know he was about to use it to his full advantage and there was nothing I could do about it.</p><p>I knew the drill. Get up and hide, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have time to cool off. But I couldn\u2019t move. I kept thinking about my brothers who were gone and had left me behind like an old t-shirt. We used to be in this together, now it was just me. I started to cry, like a stupid fucking baby, and I knew it was only going to piss him off more.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying? What the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d He didn\u2019t slow his momentum as he raised his fist and slammed it into my shoulder.</p><p>The pain that spread up my neck and down my arm sucked my oxygen out in one swift snap of a finger and I crumpled to the floor, blinking the black spots away from my eyes.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d He kicked me in the side, but I couldn\u2019t get up. My legs had given up on me and with each slam of his shoe, something died inside. I didn\u2019t even bother tucking my legs in to protect them. I just let the pain take over, allowing it to numb the pain of being left behind. \u201cYou\u2019re so useless! At least your brothers fight back. But what are you? Nothing! It\u2019s all your fault!\u201d Another kick, this time against my gut and the pain shot up into my head.</p><p>\u201cGet up! Get up. Get up...\u201d His boot slammed into my gut and his voice took on pleading. As if it was all my fault and he wanted me to make it stop. And maybe it was my fault. All I had to do was get up. But even something so simple I couldn\u2019t get right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was the worst beating I ever had, like he had channeled all his frustration with my brothers and directed it all on me. My mom kept me out of school for two weeks while I healed, telling the school, family, friends, neighbors\u2014anyone who asked that I had strep throat and was highly contagious.</p><p>I lay in bed almost the entire time, feeling my body heal, but my mind and will to live died, knowing it would never get better, that this was it for me.</p><p>I blink the thought away as I sit down on the floor and lift up my shirt. I vowed when I went to college that I\u2019d give it up\u2014stop the fucking habit. But I guess it owns me more than I thought.</p><p>The next day in Biology I\u2019m trying to hold as still as possible to keep the pain on my stomach contained, but I keep glancing behind me at Callie, who seems oblivious that I\u2019m turning into a stalker.</p> <p>Professor Fremont takes his sweet time wrapping up his lecture. By the time I make it into the hall, it\u2019s crammed with people. I\u2019m blocking the doorway, trying to determine whether I want to skip my next class or not, when someone slams into my back.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. I\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Callie apologizes, backing away from me like I\u2019m a criminal. \u201cI wasn\u2019t paying attention to where I was going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to apologize. I promise I\u2019m perfectly fine, even though you ran into me.\u201d I flash a grin at her as I move to the side, so people can get by. As my midsection turns, my muscles burn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Callie repeats and then shuts her eyes, shaking her head at herself. \u201cI just have a bad habit of saying sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, but maybe you should work on breaking it,\u201d I suggest, bracing my hand on the doorframe. Her brown hair is pulled up and thin wisps hang around her face. She\u2019s wearing jeans, a plain purple t-shirt, and minimal makeup. Her tits aren\u2019t hanging out of her top and her jeans aren\u2019t skin tight to show off her curves, like how Daisy dresses every day. There\u2019s nothing to check out, yet I find myself really looking at her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, but it\u2019s hard.\u201d She looks down at the brown carpet, so shy and innocent. The girl looks like she needs a thousand hugs to erase all the sadness she\u2019s carrying around on her shoulders. \u201cHabits are very hard to break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I take you out somewhere?\u201d I ask without even thinking about what I\u2019m doing or what the consequences will be. \u201cI really want to say thank you for, well, you know, for what you did.\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids flutter open and my heart skips a beat. That\u2019s never happened before and it tosses me into a momentary state of vertigo. \u201cI\u2019m actually supposed to meet Seth in just a few minutes, but maybe some other time,\u201d she says evasively and starts down the hall, swinging her bag over her shoulder.</p><p>I fall into step with her. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s an interesting person. I have him in my English class and he always raises his hand, just to give the wrong answer.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile touches at her lips. \u201cHe does it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Pressing my palm against the glass, I hold the door open for her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>She blocks the sun from her eyes with her hand as she steps outside. \u201cBecause it\u2019s on the list.\u201d</p><p>I pause just outside the doorway, cocking an eyebrow. \u201cThe list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d She waves her hand at me dismissively. \u201cLook, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>She picks up the pace, her thin legs moving quickly as she leaves me in the campus yard, her head tucked down and her shoulders hunched as if she\u2019s doing everything she can to be nonexistent.</p><p>Callie</p><p>My dorm room is located in the McIntyre building, which is the tallest of the residence halls. I swipe my ID card to get into the hall and then push a code to enter my room. From out the window, the people look tiny, like I\u2019m a bird seeing everything from an Aerial view.</p><p>I pull out my journal that I keep hidden beneath my pillow and grab a pen. I started writing in it when I was thirteen, as a way to put my thoughts down on paper. I wasn\u2019t planning on making it a lifelong hobby, but I feel so much better when I write, like my brain is finally free to say whatever it wants.</p><p>The edges of the cover are tattered and some of the pages are falling off from the spiral. I sit down with my legs crisscrossed, and press the tip to a clean sheet.</p> <p>It\u2019s amazing how the things you remember forever are the things you\u2019d rather forget and the things you desperately want to grasp onto seem to slip away like sand in the wind.</p><p>I remember everything about that day, like the images have been burned into my brain by a branding iron. But I wish they would blow away in the wind.</p><p>There\u2019s a knock on my door. Sighing, I hide the notebook back under the pillow before answering the door. Seth strolls in with two iced lattes and he hands one to me.</p><p>\u201cYou sounded like you could use one of these.\u201d He shucks off his jacket, drapes it over a chair that\u2019s in front of the desk, and sinks down on the bed. \u201cOkay, spill your guts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s talking to me and asking me to go places.\u201d I pace the floor in front of my bed and sip on the straw. There are sketches and a poster of Rise Against on my roommate\u2019s side of the wall, and her bed is covered in dirty clothes. \u201cHe\u2019s never really talked to me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho, Kayden?\u201d Seth asks and I nod. He flops onto my bed and scrolls through my playlists on my iPod. \u201cMaybe he likes you.\u201d</p><p>I stop in the middle of the room and shake my head, the ice swishing in the cup. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what it is. He has a girlfriend\u2014a super slutty girlfriend who he can touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would probably touch you, if you\u2019d let him,\u201d he says and my breath catches in my throat. \u201cOkay, so we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d</p><p>Setting the coffee on the desk, I sink down on my bed and tuck my hands under my legs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever be there. I think I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I won\u2019t ever be able to handle going that far with anyone. I may end up being one of those old ladies with a thousand cats and eating cat food straight out of the can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, gross, I would never let you turn into that. And second of all, we should add it to the list.\u201d He sits up and reaches for a pen on my nightstand.</p><p>\u201cJust because it\u2019s on the list, doesn\u2019t mean it will happen,\u201d I say as he stands up and marches to the board on the back of the door where our list is written.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does, Callie.\u201d He grins, flipping the cap off the pen with his thumb. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a magical list, full of possibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish that were true.\u201d I stare out the window at the people flooding the campus yard. \u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>The pen squeaks as he scribbles something down. When I return my attention to him, he\u2019s added, #52 Take a Chance For God\u2019s Sake to the bottom of the list. He clicks the cap on, cocks his head, and smiles with pride at his cleverness.</p><p>\u201cI do amaze myself sometimes. I\u2019m going to have to add this one to my copy of the list when I get back to my room.\u201d He tosses the pen onto the dresser and sits down on the bed. \u201cSo what\u2019s your chance, Callie? Because I know you\u2019re strong enough to at least try one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if I take a chance and everything crumbles?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat if I trust someone again and they steal something away from me. I don\u2019t really have that much left before I\u2019m hollow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake an easy chance,\u201d he singsongs. \u201cCome on, Callie, do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to peer pressure me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, is it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, since I don\u2019t know what you want me to do.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his hands together with a devious gleam in his eyes. \u201cI have an idea. You should call Kayden and take him up on his offer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Seth.\u201d I pull my knees up and rest my chin on them. \u201cI can\u2019t be around people like him. They make me nervous and remind me too much of high school. Besides, soon it\u2019s going to dawn on him how much his girlfriend hates me and he\u2019s going to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems nice.\u201d Seth removes his cellphone from his pocket and checks the screen. \u201cI even have his phone number in my phone.\u201d</p><p>My brows knit. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m scandalous.\u201d He swipes his finger over the screen to turn it on. I dive for him with my arm out, but he jumps out of my reach and runs for the door. \u201cHere we go.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and put my hands on my hips, digging my fingers into my skin as I hunch over and force air through my lungs. \u201cSeth, please don\u2019t. I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t do well around guys.\u201d</p><p>He puts the phone up to his ear with a stern look on his face. \u201cCallie, you have to remember that not all guys are him.... Hello, is this Kayden?\u201d He pauses. \u201cYeah, this is Seth. Hold on just a second. Callie wants to talk to you.\u201d Covering the mouthpiece with his hand, he extends the phone toward me. \u201cTake. A. Chance.\u201d</p><p>I remove my hands from my hips and my skin is dotted with red-crescent moon marks from my fingernails. I take the phone from him, my pulse erratic through my fingers, my wrists, and my neck as I raise it to my ear.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I say, my voice barely a whisper.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he replies, sounding lost, but intrigued. \u201cDid you need something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I was thinking that maybe... I could still take you up on that offer to go somewhere,\u201d I explain, and Seth motions his hand at me encouragingly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do anything right now, but maybe later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just getting ready to leave to explore the town,\u201d he says as I bite on my fingernail. \u201cDo you want to go with me?\u201d</p><p>I nod, even though he can\u2019t see me. \u201cYes, that sounds nice. Should I meet you outside or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what Luke\u2019s truck looks like?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cIs it that rusted one he used to drive in high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the one. Why don\u2019t you meet me by it in like ten minutes? It\u2019s parked near the side entrance of the quad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, sounds good.\u201d I hang up and scowl at Seth.</p><p>He claps his hands and does a little dance. \u201cSee, taking a chance isn\u2019t so bad. In fact, it can turn out really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I panic, though?\u201d I hand him the phone back and grab a hoodie from my dresser drawer. \u201cWhat if I do something really weird? I\u2019ve never been alone with a strange guy before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He puts his hands on my shoulders and looks me in the eyes. \u201cJust be the Callie I know.\u201d</p><p>I zip up my jacket. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll try my damn hardest.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and then encloses his arms around me, drawing me in for a hug. \u201cAnd if you need anything, you can call me. I\u2019ll always be here for you.\u201d</p><p>Kayden isn\u2019t out in the parking lot. As I wait by Luke\u2019s truck, I watch the other students hurry to and from class and I almost bolt. As I step up onto the curb to head back to my dorm, Kayden exits out the side doors of the building. He\u2019s talking to a girl with wavy black hair that runs all the way down her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019s wearing jeans that hang low on his hips and a long-sleeve, dark grey Henley. The way he moves is captivating. He\u2019s got a lot of swagger in the movement of his hips, yet his shoulders bend in and his whole stomach area looks stiff, as if walking causes him pain.</p><p>I step back to the truck and wait with my arms crossed over my chest. When he sees me, his lips turn upward and he waves good-bye to the girl, who I think is in my Philosophy class.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late.\u201d He hitches his thumb over his shoulder at the girl walking away. \u201cKellie needed help with an English assignment. Were you waiting here a long time?\u201d</p><p>I drop my arms to my side then fold them over my chest again, unable to figure out what to do with them. \u201cNot for too long.\u201d</p> <p>He steps off the curb and I began to recoil as he reaches toward my side. But he grips the door handle and I relax, sidestepping so he can open it.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He pulls the door open and the hinges creak as bits of rust fall off the edge.</p><p>Nodding, I put one foot up on the floor of the truck, and hop in. The vinyl fabric of the seat is frayed and pokes through my jeans, scratching at my skin. He slams the door and I wring my hands on top of my lap. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been alone with a guy in a car before, except for Seth, and my heart challenges my chest to endure its wrath.</p><p>\u201cCallie, are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d he asks with his hands on top of the steering wheel. \u201cYou look a little pale.\u201d</p><p>I force my eyes to concentrate on him, trying not to blink too much. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just a little tired. College wears me out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI completely agree on that.\u201d He offers me a smile that crinkles around his eyes as he starts up the engine. It chugs and then backfires. \u201cSorry, Luke\u2019s truck is a piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>I spread my sweaty palms flat on my knees. \u201cWhat happened to your car? The one you used to drive to school. Did you leave it at home?\u201d</p><p>His throat muscles work to swallow a lump in his throat. \u201cMy dad has a rule that once we leave the house, we\u2019re on our own. The car was bought by him, so therefore it\u2019s his.\u201d</p><p>I nod, reaching over my shoulder to grab the seatbelt. \u201cI don\u2019t have a car either. My parents offered to give me my brother\u2019s old car, but I declined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He shoves the shifter into gear and the tires roll forward. \u201cIt seems like life would be easier if you had one.\u201d</p><p>I click the buckle into the lock and then watch the leafy trees zip by as we pull out onto the street and away from the campus. \u201cIt seemed like too much responsibility, I guess. Besides, I wasn\u2019t really planning on leaving the campus very much.\u201d</p> <p>He turns on the wipers to wash the grime off the windshield. \u201cI kind of have a question and feel free not to answer it.\u201d He dithers. \u201cHow come you never hung out with anyone in high school? After I started thinking about it, I just don\u2019t remember you doing anything.\u201d</p><p>I scratch at the back of my neck until it stings. \u201cThat\u2019s because I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>He watches me, waiting for me to elaborate, his eyes on me instead of the road, but I can\u2019t tell him anything. It\u2019s my secret and I\u2019ll take it to the grave of shame.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this really awesome place I heard about where you can stand up on the hills and see the whole town,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking we could go there. It\u2019s not too far of a hike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hike?\u201d I question. \u201cLike we would walk up a mountain?\u201d</p><p>He laughs and I feel like a moron. \u201cYeah, like we\u2019d walk up hills and everything.\u201d</p><p>I scrunch up my nose at my brown boots that fold down at the top. They\u2019re a size too small and just walking around campus gives me blisters. \u201cOkay, I guess we can go on a hike.\u201d</p><p>His lips part as he starts to say something, but his phone rings from inside his pocket. His brows decline as he reads the name on the glowing screen. \u201cCan you be quiet for a second?\u201d he asks with a guilty face.</p> <p>I nod, eyeing his phone. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey baby, what\u2019s up?\u201d he answers and I can hear Daisy\u2019s voice on the other end.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t say that to them and maybe they won\u2019t get mad.\u201d Kayden pauses. \u201cYeah, I know. I miss you too. I can\u2019t wait until homecoming.... No, I haven\u2019t got a tux yet.\u201d</p><p>A hint of jealousy burns in my heart. When I was younger, I dreamt of going to prom and wearing a pretty dress with lots of sparkles on it. I even wanted a tiara, which seems silly now.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d He says flatly and then quickly hangs up the phone.</p><p>My jealousy lifts and I let out a breath I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been holding.</p><p>He tosses the phone onto the seat between us. \u201cThat was Daisy... you know Daisy McMillian, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy your tone, I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you guess that?\u201d</p><p>His hands grip the wheel as his eyes evaluate me. \u201cBecause most people don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then why do you date her?\u201d I ask, wondering where the forwardness is coming from.</p><p>He shrugs, his jawline rigid. \u201cShe\u2019s a nice girlfriend. She keeps me happy for the most part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I\u2019m being pushy, aren\u2019t I?\u201d I grip the edge of my seatbelt as he turns onto a dirt road with large potholes and a very sharp drop off on the side of it. It weaves up into the mountains that are green with trees and grass.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t being pushy. I was asking you questions first.\u201d He grinds his jaw and his fingers tighten on the wheel.</p><p>We\u2019re quiet for the rest of the drive and I can tell something must have upset him. The wheels in his head are turning as his mind sorts through something complex.</p><p>A ways up the hill, he cranks the steering wheel to the right and veers the truck toward a turnout. A long ditch sections across the entrance and he gradually slows down. The truck bumps and then slants as he pumps the gas again and ramps back up, jolting us from left to right. When we\u2019re on flat land again, he directs the bumper at the trees and inches it forward until it\u2019s close, then shoves the shifter into park and turns the engine off.</p><p>A steep hill slopes up in front of us and there is graffiti on the side of a rock in various colors marking dates, lyrics, poems, and declarations of love. There are other vehicles parked next to us and on the road. People are on the path and up on top of the hill. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re not alone, but don\u2019t like that there are a lot of people. It\u2019s kind of problematic.</p><p>He flips the handle and prods the door open with his elbow. \u201cI promise it\u2019s not that far. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told. If it ends up being intense, just let me know and we can turn back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d I push my door open and swing my feet out, avoiding a puddle. I meet him around the front of the truck and tuck my hands into my pockets that are lined with soft fabric and the feel of it brings me comfort, because it reminds me of a teddy bear.</p><p>We walk up the dirt path and pass by a couple sitting on a boulder in hiking boots with backpacks on. They wave at us and Kayden returns the wave while I stare up at a rock that is stained with paint.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I wonder aloud and read one of the quotes. \u201cSeize the day, take hold of it, and make it whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>He dodges to the side of the path to avoid a large hole and his shoulder accidentally bumps into mine. \u201cI guess it\u2019s a tradition for the seniors at UW to come up here and write words of wisdom to all future seniors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRock on and prosper.\u201d I glance at him, my lips quirking. \u201cThat\u2019s very deep.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and lines form around his mouth. \u201cI never said they were all words of wisdom, only that I heard that\u2019s what they are supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>I scoot over toward the rocky hill to gain a little distance between us. \u201cIt seems like a good idea, kind of. To mark the end with whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He hops over a massive rock, his lengthy legs stretching as he lands on top of it, and then leaps off the other side. He\u2019s panting, smiling, and proud of himself. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the whole bonfire thing back in Afton, where we write down our thoughts on a piece of paper and then burn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never went to that,\u201d I admit, clenching my hands into fists. If I had, I would have been tortured by people whispering that I was a devil worshiper who never ate anything. Because my hacked job hair, excessive black eyeliner, and antisocial behavior could have only been the work of the devil.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He examines me for a while as I pretend not to notice. \u201cCallie, I\u2019d like to get to know you. I mean, you saved my ass and I barely know anything about you.\u201d</p><p>I pluck a leaf off a bush and peel at the waxy edges. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to know, really. I\u2019m kind of a boring person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that\u2019s true.\u201d He kicks a rock over the ledge of the cliff. \u201cHow about I\u2019ll tell you something about me and then you can tell me something about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kinds of things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you want.\u201d</p><p>We halt as we reach the end of the path. It widens to an area bordered by hills and boulders and there\u2019s an enormous cliff paved by edges that look like stairs. It\u2019s steep, but climbable.</p><p>\u201cHow do we get up?\u201d I drop the leaf onto the ground and tip my head back to look at the top.</p><p>Rubbing his hands together, he grabs a hold of one of the stairs and props his shoe onto the lower one. \u201cWe climb up.\u201d With a bounce of his knee, he jumps up, like he\u2019s ascending up a rock wall. Once he\u2019s halfway up, he looks over his shoulder at me. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d</p><p>I glance behind me at the path curving down the hill, and then back up at the cliff. Take a chance for God\u2019s sake. Even though I\u2019m afraid of heights, I grip the coarse edge, bounce onto my toes, and heave myself up. Positioning each of my feet on a ledge, I maneuver my way up to the next one, getting lightheaded the higher I climb. When I look down, I freeze with the fear of splattering against the rocks below. The wind sneaks through my hair and pieces slip loose from the elastic.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make it?\u201d He stands at the top with his hands on his hips like he\u2019s the king of the world, which would be an awesome job, if it existed. I could wear a crown and everyone would have to listen to me. If I said stay away, then they would.</p><p>I inhale through my nose and move my hand to the next step. \u201cYeah...\u201d As my fingers slip, I squeeze my eyes tightly and my back bows inward. I\u2019m not going to fall, but it makes me feel helpless and I can\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Callie,\u201d he says. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>My fingers snag another ledge and I dig them in as my airflow decreases. Dizziness swarms through my brain and my knees tremble, about to buckle underneath me.</p><p>\u201cCallie, open your eyes,\u201d Kayden says in a soft, but commanding voice and I crack an eyelid open. He\u2019s climbed down and his feet are just above my head with his long arm stretched toward me. \u201cGive me your hand and I\u2019ll help you get up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I eye his hand like it\u2019s the devil, because that\u2019s what hands can be; they can own you, pin you down, touch you without permission. Biting my lip, I shake my head. \u201cI can do it on my own. I was just thrown off for a moment.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and the muscles in his arm relax. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of heights, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I lean inward until my body is pressed against the jagged rocks. \u201cSlightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d he repeats, his voice is soft, but his eyes are demanding. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll help you to the top.\u201d</p> <p>The wind increases and dust stings at my cheeks. My body heats with my nerves as I shut my eyes and place my hand into his. Our fingers entwine, a shock zips through my arm, and my eyes lift up to him.</p><p>Tightening his grip, Kayden hoist me up, the muscles of his arms flexing until I\u2019m on the next stair. I plant my shoes against it and he gives me a moment before tugging on my arm again and lifting me to the next one. When he reaches the top, he lets go, but only to heave himself up. Then he extends his hand over the ledge and I grab it, trusting him again as he pulls me up. I stumble and my shoes scuff against the dirt as I work to regain my steadiness.</p><p>His hand comes around my back and touches me just above the waist to steady me. My body stiffens as a mixture of emotions gust through me. I like that he\u2019s touching me, the gentleness of his fingers, and the warmth of his nearness. But then my mind flashes back to a big hand shoving at my back until I land on a bed.</p><p>I whirl around with my eyes amplified as strands of my hair float in front of my face. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says with his hands out in front of him and a cautious look on his face. \u201cI was just helping you get your balance.\u201d</p> <p>I reach up to secure the elastic in my hair. \u201cI\u2019m sorry... it\u2019s just that... that had nothing to do with you, I swear. I just have issues.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his hands to his side and watches me for the longest time. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be pushy, but you seem kind of jumpy. Can I... Do you care if I ask why?\u201d</p><p>I aim my gaze to the view over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019d rather you not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says simply and faces the opening of the cliff.</p><p>I move up beside to him, leaving a small gap between us. The hills roll for miles; green, flourishing, dotted with trees and hikers. The blue sky is endless and the sun illuminates through the thin white clouds. There\u2019s a breeze coming upward and also across and as they collide it makes me feel as if I\u2019m flying.</p><p>\u201cIt kind of reminds me of that painting Mr. Garibaldi had on his wall.\u201d Kayden rubs his scruffy chin thoughtfully.</p> <p>\u201cThe one he was so proud of? And talked about all the time?\u201d I leave my hands at my hips but bring them out a little and put my palms flat as I imagine what it\u2019s like to be a bird, flying up high and free.</p><p>He laughs and his head falls forward, his hair falling across his forehead. \u201cDid he tell that story to every class?\u201d</p><p>I roll my tongue around in my mouth as I restrain a smile. \u201cI think it was a tradition. It was his way of bragging that there was a time in his life where he wasn\u2019t stuck in a classroom.\u201d</p><p>He raises his head back up and exhales gradually. \u201cHow long do you want to stay up here?\u201d</p><p>I shrug and turn for the ledge. \u201cWe can go back, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go back,\u201d he says and I pause. \u201cUnless you do?\u201d</p><p>I glance back out at the hills. \u201cI\u2019d like to stay here longer if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly okay.\u201d He sits down in the dirt and crosses his legs as he stretches them out in front of him. Then he pats the spot next to him.</p> <p>I stare at it for a long time before I drop to the ground and cross my legs too. My muscles constrict at the fact that our legs are so close, but I don\u2019t move over.</p><p>\u201cI kind of hate football,\u201d he reveals as he pulls one of his legs up and drapes his arm on top of his knee.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d I say, startled. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>His finger trails along the scar that runs down half his cheekbone. \u201cThe violence sometimes gets to me.\u201d</p><p>I rest back on the palms of my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t like football either. There\u2019s only one purpose and that\u2019s to dominate.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, shaking his head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far, but I get your point. I\u2019m the quarterback, though, so all I really do is throw the ball.\u201d</p><p>I drag my pinkie back and forth in the dirt. \u201cI know what position you play and what a quarterback does. My father\u2019s a coach and therefore I got to listen to a recap of every game and practice when we were eating dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s a nice guy, though,\u201d he states, cutting me a sideways glance. \u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>I know I shouldn\u2019t ask, but I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s been bothering me for months that I just left him after he\u2019d been beaten up. I never really believed that it was the only time his dad hit him. That much rage doesn\u2019t just come once and then dissolve.</p><p>\u201cKayden, what happened that night? That night I was at your house... and your dad, well, when he hit you. Did that ever happen before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s your turn to tell me something about you,\u201d he evades the question, his hands balling into fists, and his knuckles are so white the scars on them blend away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much to say about myself.\u201d I refuse to look at him as I shrug. \u201cNothing particularly interesting anyway.\u201d</p><p>He raises his hand, making a pinching position with his finger and thumb. \u201cCome on. Just one tiny detail. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking for.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, I rack my brain for an intriguing detail about me that won\u2019t be very personal. My shoulders rise up and down as I shrug. \u201cI like to kick box down at The Tune up Gym sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKick box?\u201d he questions, his forehead creasing. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I pick the dirt out of my cracked fingernails. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to relax.\u201d</p><p>His eyes scan my body from my toes to my face and my cheeks heat. \u201cYou look too tiny to be a kick boxer. I can\u2019t picture those little legs of yours being able to do very much damage.\u201d</p><p>If I were braver, I would challenge him to a match right here, just to prove him wrong.</p><p>I angle my chin up to the sky and place my hand in front of my eyes to block out the brightness of the sunlight. \u201cI don\u2019t do it for sport, just for fun. It\u2019s a good way to... I don\u2019t know...\u201d I trail off because the rest is too personal.</p><p>\u201cTo take your inner anger out,\u201d he says it more to himself than me.</p><p>I nod. \u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d He looks at me with a smile expanding at his full lips. \u201cThe next time you go, you should call me. My coach, who\u2019s kind of a dick compared to your dad, has been hounding me to get into better shape. Then you can show me how much damage that little body of yours can do. I\u2019ll even tone it down and give you a chance to pin me down.\u201d</p><p>I bite on my lip to keep from smiling. \u201cAlright, but I don\u2019t go that often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you feel like kicking some ass?\u201d he teases with a crook of his eyebrow.</p><p>My lips twitch to a tiny smile. \u201cYeah, something like that.\u201d</p><p>He turns sideways so he\u2019s facing me and crisscrosses his legs. \u201cOkay, I have another question. I actually just remembered this. I think it was back in fifth grade and your family was over at my house for one of those stupid barbeques my dad has every Super Bowl. Somehow a collector football disappeared from my dad\u2019s display case and everyone thought it was my brother Tyler that did it, because he was acting weird, but really he was just wasted. But I swear to fucking God I saw you walking out to your car with it under your shirt.\u201d</p><p>I tuck my feet under my butt as I cover my hands over my face. \u201cMy brother told me to do that. He said if I stole it for him he wouldn\u2019t tell my mom that I was the one who broke one of her silly little collector unicorns.\u201d I pause and it gets really quiet. Finally, I work up the courage to peek between the cracks in my fingers. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>He scrutinizes me and then a slow smile forms on his face. \u201cCallie, I\u2019m just messing with you. I don\u2019t care if you did it. In fact, it\u2019s kind of funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I bet your brother got into trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, he was eighteen.\u201d He draws my hand away from my face. \u201cAnd when my dad started being a douche, he just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a douche. I think my brother still has it in his room. I should make him give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He\u2019s still holding my hand as he guides my arm toward my knees. I\u2019m very aware of his fingertips touching my wrist right above my hammering pulse and I\u2019m conflicted on whether or not to pull away. \u201cMy dad can go without some of his shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I can\u2019t take my eyes off his hand on my arm. \u201cI swear I can give it back.\u201d</p><p>He laughs softly and then his fingers graze the inside of my wrist, causing my entire body to shiver. \u201cI promise. No harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>He looks at me with this strange expression, like he\u2019s conflicted about something. He licks his lips and then presses them together, holding his breath.</p><p>I\u2019ve often wondered what a guy would look like when he was about ready to kiss me. Would it be the same as my first and only kiss; a glimmer of conquer blazing within the pupils? Or would it be something else entirely different? Something less terrifying? Filled with more passion and desire?</p><p>Turning back to the cliff, he frees my wrist and his hand begins to tremor. He flexes it, elongating his fingers and letting out a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with your hand?\u201d I ask, struggling to maintain a steady voice. \u201cDid you hurt it climbing up?\u201d</p><p>He balls it into a fist and places it on his lap. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just broke a few bones a while ago and it gets that way sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it effect how you play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, but I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the scars on his knuckles, remembering the night when they were split open. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><p>He stretches out his legs and leans back on his hands. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get the scars on your hand?\u201d I reach out to touch them, the need to feel him so intense it temporarily overpowers my doubts, but life catches up with me and I swiftly move my hand away.</p><p>Putting his weight on one arm, he elevates his hand out in front of him. At the bottom of each finger is a thick white scar. \u201cI punched a wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose,\u201d he adds, and then makes a path with his finger along each bump and groove. \u201cAccidents happen sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I recollect his dad slamming his fist into his face. \u201cYeah, I guess they do, but sometimes bad things happen on purpose by the hands of bad people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He nods, then gets to his feet, and dusts the dirt off his jeans. \u201cWe should head back. I got a killer Literature paper I have to write.\u201d He offers me his hand to help me up, but I just can\u2019t bring myself to take it.</p><p>I turn over onto my hands and knees and push myself to my feet. \u201cNow I just have to make it back down,\u201d I say with a sigh as I walk toward the cliff and peek over the edge.</p><p>He laughs quietly as he follows behind me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll help you down, if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes broaden at his words and then at the cliff. What a dilemma. But I trusted him once and I decide to do it again. I just pray to God he doesn\u2019t shove me down and break me, because I\u2019m already in too many pieces and I just don\u2019t know how much more breaking I can take.</p> <p>Kayden</p><p>I\u2019m nervous helping her scale down the cliff and not because I think she\u2019s going to fall. My arm is around her back and her weight is against me. She\u2019s safe and I\u2019m glad she is.</p><p>The problem lies inside me. The entire time we\u2019re climbing down, my heart is thumping in my chest. I want to reach over and feel her skin, suck on her lips, even let my fingers graze her ass. I\u2019ve never wanted anyone like this before and it\u2019s fucking scary as hell. For a second, I considered kissing her while we were up on the cliff, but it would have been wrong of me. Not only because I shouldn\u2019t be kissing someone as nice as Callie, but also because I have a girlfriend and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to anyone.</p><p>Even though our conversation on the cliff was a minor moment in time, it held more depth than any other conversation I\u2019ve had. When I talk to Daisy, it mostly focuses on shallow things, like homecoming, what she is going to wear, and where the parties are going to take place. That\u2019s how I want my life. Simple. I already have enough complexity locked away inside me to shadow the whole world with darkness.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure we\u2019re not going to fall?\u201d Callie grips at my upper arm, delving her fingertips into the fabric of my shirt as she blinks her eyes at the ground. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re going to drop me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to drop you. I promise.\u201d I tighten my arm around her back and gently tug her closer. \u201cJust relax. We\u2019re almost there.\u201d</p><p>I slide my foot down along the rock toward the next ledge, resisting the urge to grab her ass, and place my hand on her lower back. She reaches her hand down, holding on to me as she stretches her leg toward the lower ridge. Once her foot touches it, she relaxes as she steps down on the one below.</p><p>I let go of her as her feet touch the bottom. \u201cSee, I told you I wouldn\u2019t drop you.\u201d</p><p>Showing off a little, I jump down the rest of the way and land in front of her, ignoring the pain in my calf muscles. \u201cRemind me never to take you somewhere up high again.\u201d</p><p>She makes an apologetic face as she brushes the dirt off the front of her shirt with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should have warned you. Although, climbing like that doesn\u2019t seem very natural. It felt like we were trying to be lizards or something.</p><p>Unable to help myself, I laugh at her. It\u2019s been a while and it feels good. \u201cSo for future planning, what kind of places do you like to go?\u201d</p> <p>She looks about as lost as I feel. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell think about it.\u201d I start down the path toward where the truck is parked and Callie follows me. \u201cAnd the next time I ask you if you want to hang out, you can tell me where.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead creases as she stares out at the hills to the side of us. \u201cIs there going to be a next time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I say casually. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t there be?\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and shrugs, looking unconvinced. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>It seems like she knows a lot of things, which is why I should be running away from her, before she finds out about me. But like my father always says, I was never that bright, and I have a feeling I\u2019m not going to be able to stay away.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>#43 Don\u2019t Take Shit From Anyone</p> <p>Kayden</p><p>I\u2019m having a good dream. Callie and I are climbing down the cliff. As I help her to the bottom, she bites at her bottom lip, stumbling back against the rocks, looking nervous as hell.</p><p>With my eyes locked on her lips, I place my hands on the rocky wall, so her head is trapped between my arms. Her body trembles as I tip my head down and breathe against her neck. I love that she\u2019s shivering and I want to make her shiver more.</p><p>The palms of my hands slide down the rocks, the jagged edges scraping against my skin. It\u2019s a combination of pain and fucking want and my adrenaline pumps through my body. Gripping her hips, her lips part as her head falls back and she moans.</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me,\u201d I say, because I have a feeling she\u2019s never told anyone that.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she breathes.</p><p>Lifting her up, my lips come down on hers as I press up against her, wanting nothing more than to rip her clothes off and bury my dick deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cWake up, lover boy.\u201d A warm hand pats my cheek and I fling my arm at them because they\u2019re ruining my dream.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sexy boy.\u201d Someone bounces on top of me. \u201cYou have a present waiting for you if you wake up.\u201d</p><p>I blink my eyes open to a pair of blue eyes and a lot of curly blond hair hanging in my face.</p><p>Daisy is straddling my lap, wearing a short denim skirt, and a white lacy top. \u201cSurprise.\u201d</p><p>I rise up on my elbows, feeling deflated and wanting to go back to my dream to see how it ends. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrow at me. \u201cWay to welcome the love of your life. God Kayden, you can be such an asshole sometimes.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and put on my plastic smile. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m just tired. Between school and practice, I barely have time to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She scrunches the ends of her hair with her fingers. \u201cWell, wake up. You need to take me out somewhere before I have to go home. I\u2019m only here for like an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I ask with caution as I sit up and lean against the headboard.</p><p>She shakes out her hair and adjusts her top over her stomach. \u201cMy mom drove here to go shopping. It\u2019s the closest place where she can buy shoes that don\u2019t have generic brands on them.\u201d</p><p>I arch my eyebrows, feigning interest. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>She nods and then walks her fingers up my bare chest that\u2019s covered up by a sheet. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come with her and see you. You can take me out and then maybe you\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have class,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Luke? I\u2019m guessing he let you in? But who let you into the building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my ways.\u201d She slips her leg off me and gets to her feet. \u201cLuke let me into the room and then left. I don\u2019t get what his deal is with me. I mean, if I so much as look at him, he runs in the other direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just quiet.\u201d I sit up and the sheet falls off my chest.</p><p>She takes in the white lines that run in every direction along my skin likes she\u2019s forgotten they were there. \u201cYou know they have laser treatments that can fade scars away? Maybe you should look into it.\u201d She traces her fingernail down my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019d be perfect if you didn\u2019t have those scars.\u201d</p><p>I slide away from her, take a red t-shirt out of the dresser, and put it on. \u201cThere. Now you can\u2019t see them.\u201d</p><p>She crinkles her nose. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be rude. I was just telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>I grab a pair of jeans off the floor, pull them on, and fasten the button before slipping on my shoes. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201d</p><p>She taps her lip thoughtfully. \u201cSurprise me. Just as long as it\u2019s somewhere nice.\u201d</p><p>I swipe up my wallet and phone and then open the door for her. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t have my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh.\u201d She rolls her eyes as I shut the door. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made my mom let me use hers. She\u2019s stuck at the mall so we have to make this a quickie. Although, you better make sure I enjoy it.\u201d She flashes me a grin and sways her hips as she struts down the hall. Her skirt barely covers her ass and her long legs stretch with confidence. A few guys walking down the hall check out her ass.</p><p>When she approaches the door, she waits for me to open it for her and then we step out into the sunshine. The campus yard is packed with people heading to and from class with books in their hands.</p><p>We start down the path beneath the trees, and Seth and Callie emerge at the end. Callie has a long sleeved purple shirt on and her hair is pulled up. My mind drifts back to my dirty dream and how it felt to have her in my arms.</p><p>She\u2019s talking to Seth with a serious expression on her face and Seth is waving his arms in the air animatedly. When her eyes meet mine, they light up for a split second then she looks over at Daisy. Callie is the sweetest girl I\u2019ve ever met, but the look on her face is filled with hatred.</p><p>I start to wave, when she extends her arm up toward me with an ID card in her hand. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to give this to you.\u201d Her tone is flat.</p><p>I take my card from her, offering her a small smile. \u201cThanks. How did you end up with this?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cLuke said he grabbed it by accident. He stopped me after class and asked if I could stop by your dorm and give it to you, but since I ran into you, here you go.\u201d</p><p>Daisy gives Callie a once over. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s eyes are as cold as ice. \u201cCallie Lawrence.\u201d</p><p>Daisy sneers maliciously. \u201cOh my God. It\u2019s the Anorexic Satan Worshipper. Different clothes, but the same skinny body. Starve yourself much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy,\u201d I say in a tight voice. \u201cBack off.\u201d</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes widen, which means Callie must have told him about Daisy. But why? Am I missing something?</p><p>Daisy glares at me. \u201cMaybe I should ask you what the fuck you\u2019re doing? Hanging out with someone like her.\u201d</p><p>A light turns off in Callie\u2019s eyes as she starts to step around us, but Seth whisks forward and gets in Daisy\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re being so cocky about girl,\u201d he says. \u201cTake away that push up bra, fake tan, dyed hair, and fancy clothes, and all you\u2019d be is a slightly overweight girl with a really bad nose job.\u201d</p><p>Daisy gasps and covers her nose with her hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a nose job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you say.\u201d He smirks at her, links arms with Callie, and waves to me. \u201cSee you later, Kayden.\u201d</p><p>Callie doesn\u2019t look at me as they dart around us and hurry off toward the front entrance of the campus.</p><p>Daisy places her hands on her hips and purses her lips. \u201cWhy were you talking to that girl?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou remember who she is, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s Callie Lawrence.\u201d I shrug and head up the sidewalk. \u201cShe was in my grade at school and was really quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was also a freak.\u201d She laces her fingers through mine and it sends a feeling of numbness through my body. \u201cShe\u2019s anorexic and used to wear all those baggy clothes. She had that God awful haircut and never talked to anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not anorexic or a Satan Worshiper.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cAnd she wasn\u2019t always like that, nor is she like that anymore. She\u2019s pretty normal.\u201d And sad. And every time I look at her it rips at my heart. \u201cBesides, she\u2019s helped me out with some stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d she questions, giving me a hard stare, like she\u2019s about to claw my eyes out. \u201cAre you sleeping with her? Because if you are, that\u2019s disgusting and pathetic.\u201d</p><p>For a second I consider telling her that I am, then stand there and watch her walk away, ridding her from my life. But then what the hell would I do? Date someone else? Date Callie? As much as my mind loves that idea of that\u2014and my dick\u2014she\u2019s too good for me and even from the few moments I\u2019ve spent with her, I\u2019ve felt everything way too much.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t sleep with her. She\u2019s just someone I talk to sometimes,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s the partial truth, because that\u2019s who Callie needs to be to me.</p><p>Callie</p><p>There\u2019s no one else at the library, except for the librarian who\u2019s pushing a cart around, putting books back on the shelves. I wonder if she lives alone, has cats\u2014I wonder if she\u2019s happy.</p><p>\u201cSo how much time has to go by before we can talk about what happened?\u201d Seth asks, fanning through the pages of a textbook.</p><p>I feel terrible, like a child, only I\u2019m not anymore. I\u2019m a grown woman, in college, yet I reacted like I\u2019m in high school. I hate that crossing paths with someone from my past can throw me back to the darkness and sadness that may always be a part of me.</p><p>I shrug, highlighting a note on a page with a bright yellow marker. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to talk about?\u201d</p><p>He snatches the marker from my hand and it leaves a yellow streak along the paper. \u201cThe fact that you just let that damn bitch walk all over you and the fact that Kayden barely said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he? He never did before. I\u2019m not his problem.\u201d I peek up at the window where a trail of sunlight streams in. \u201cWhat happened out there was the story of my life. Soon she\u2019ll be gone and I won\u2019t have to think about her.\u201d</p><p>He drops the marker onto the table and gazes out at the trees. \u201cWhat happened with that girl is not okay. You need to grow some confidence and stand up for yourself. Next time she does something like that, pull those tacky extensions out of her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wears extensions?\u201d I ask and he nods. I smile, but then shake my head. \u201cIf it were the people who tortured you in high school, would you have been able to be so confident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about me,\u201d he presses with hard eyes. He shuts his book and crosses his arms on top of it. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want us to talk about me anymore. It\u2019s giving me a headache.\u201d I collect the marker from the table and put the cap on. \u201cHow about we call it a day for studying. There are some other projects I need to work on.\u201d</p><p>He sighs and gathers his books into a stack, before pushing away from the table. \u201cFine, but when I get back to my room, I\u2019m adding don\u2019t take fucking shit from anyone to the list.\u201d</p><p>Kayden</p><p>It\u2019s been a week since I talked to Callie. The last time was during Daisy\u2019s random visit that ended in a meaningless fuck and a half-hearted good-bye. I can\u2019t tell who\u2019s avoiding who when it comes to Callie and I, but the more time we spend apart, the more I think about her.</p><p>My mom also made a sporadic stop at my dorm yesterday when she came to visit the town, which is the bull shit lie she uses whenever she\u2019s taking a break from her drinking to go to a spa and sober up. She has a thing for painkillers and a whole lot of wine. It has been that way for as long as I can remember, which might be why she never stopped the fights. I tried to tell her once about my dad but she didn\u2019t seem too eager to do anything about it.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re just going to have to try harder,\u201d she had said, taking a sip of her wine. Some of it spilled down the front of her shirt, but she didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cSometimes we just have to deal with things the best that we can. It\u2019s called life, Kayden. Your dad\u2019s a good man. He puts a roof over our heads and gives us more than a lot of guys would. Without him, we\u2019d probably be on the streets.\u201d</p><p>I stood at the end of the table, clutching my hands into fists. \u201cBut I\u2019m trying my hardest and he only seems to get madder.\u201d</p><p>She turned the page of her magazine and when I looked into her eyes, she seemed like a ghost, absent, as lost as I was. \u201cKayden, there\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I left the room, pissed off, wishing she could be the other person for two damn minutes; the one who hosted parties and charity events and smiled. The one that wasn\u2019t a fucking zombie dosed up on pain meds.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is your problem today?\u201d Luke chucks the football down the field near the field post so it\u2019s far out of my reach. We\u2019re in our uniforms, sweaty, and exhausted, but I can\u2019t calm the fuck down.</p><p>\u201cCan we please call it a day?\u201d His cheeks are red from underneath his helmet and his shirt is soaked with sweat. \u201cI\u2019m fucking tired. Practice ended two hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d I kick one of the cones and it dents before flying over toward the bleachers. Kellie and another girl are sitting on the bottom row, with books in front of them, observing us as they talk and pretend to study.</p><p>I glance up at the grey sky and around at the bleachers that enclose the field. \u201cHow late is it?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs as he starts across the green field toward the tunnel that leads to the locker room, taking off his helmet. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s pretty damn late and I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>I follow after him, but out of the corner of my eye, I see Callie sitting in the grass below a tree at the far end of the field, on the other side of the fence. There are papers spread out in front of her and she\u2019s chewing on a pen as she reads over them.</p><p>I realize that maybe I\u2019m the one avoiding her because she makes me feel things I\u2019m not used to; the dirty dreams, the protectiveness, the way my stupid heart starts to beat like it\u2019s finally alive. Unlatching the strap below my chin, I slip off my helmet as I make my way over to her. She\u2019s so absorbed in whatever is written on the papers that she doesn\u2019t notice me. Gripping onto the top of the fence, I swing my legs over it and land on the other side. Adjusting the sleeves of the shirt under my jersey, I stop just a few feet away from her.</p><p>Her hair is twisted up in a messy bun and she has a short sleeve shirt on with a jacket tied around her waist. She stops biting on her pen to examine one of the papers closely but when my shadow casts over her, she glances up and her whole body spasms. For a second, I think she\u2019s going to leap to her feet and run off.</p><p>She catches her breath and puts her hand over her heaving chest. \u201cYou scared me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell.\u201d I drag my fingers through my damp, sweaty hair and then crouch down in front of her slowly, so I won\u2019t scare her again. If I\u2019ve learned anything, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t like people getting into her personal space without forewarning. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>She looks at the papers and then up at me again. \u201cHomework.... I like hanging out here sometimes.\u201d She gazes out at the field with recollection on her face. \u201cIt kind of reminds me of when I used to hang out with my dad while he coached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you ever being there,\u201d I say, feeling like a dick again for not remembering her. \u201cHow old were you when you did that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it for years.\u201d She swallows hard and focuses on her papers. \u201cBesides, I can\u2019t do my homework in my dorm a lot of the time. My roommate... well, sometimes...\u201d Her cheeks blush and I find myself smiling at how cute she looks, in a really innocent way. She sputters, \u201cShe has guys over a lot.\u201d</p><p>I scratch my nose to stop myself from laughing at her. \u201cI see. So you have to give her the room for a few hours.\u201d</p><p>She puts a hand on each side of the row of papers and rearranges them together until they form a stack. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I pause and an apology slips from my lips. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit as she elevates her chin to meet my eyes. \u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor not telling Daisy to shut her fucking mouth,\u201d I say. \u201cI should have. She was being a bitch to you.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, staring at the field. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to stick up for me. She\u2019s your girlfriend. You should be on her side.\u201d</p><p>I kneel down on the grass, getting closer to her. \u201cNo, I should have stuck up for you. I owe you that much.\u201d</p><p>She presses her lips firmly together, returning her attention to me. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me anything, I swear. What I did that night wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. If I would have walked away from the situation then it would have been a big deal.\u201d</p><p>I do owe her though, so much. Because of her, I have fewer scars. I wish I could take away whatever makes her look so sad all the time. I set my helmet on the grass and pick up her books for her as she reaches for her bag over by the bottom of the tree trunk. \u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d</p><p>She stuffs her papers into her bag, crinkling the edges, and then I hand her the books. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to just stay in and watch a movie or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much longer is your room preoccupied?\u201d I ask and smile as her cheeks turn even redder.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She rises on her knees, shifts her bag onto her shoulder, and gets to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll probably just go hang out with Seth until her friend is gone.\u201d</p><p>I scoop up my helmet and follow her as she heads down the line of the fence. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come out with Luke and me? He wants to go check out this club down in the Town Center. It might end up being a complete shithole, but it\u2019s better than just sitting around in your room.\u201d</p><p>She halts, adjusting the handle of her bag on her shoulder, and bites her bottom lip so hard the skin around her mouth turns purple. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask in a playful tone as I grin at her. \u201cAm I that bad to be around?\u201d</p><p>Her arms fall to her sides and her eyes fasten on mine. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I rub the sore muscles on the back of my neck. \u201cOkay, then come with us. It\u2019ll be fun and if it\u2019s not, we can go do something else.\u201d</p><p>She balls her hands into fists and then stretches her fingers back out. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m shocked. I\u2019d been flirting with her out of simple fascination with how she gets flustered, but I didn\u2019t think it would work on her. \u201cOkay, meet us at Luke\u2019s truck at like nine-ish?\u201d</p><p>She nods and turns her back to me, walking away so quickly, it\u2019s like she\u2019s terrified I\u2019ll stab her in the back. She seems afraid of everyone, except for Seth. But why?</p><p>Callie</p><p>I remember pink and white birthday balloons floating around the room, red streamers hanging from the ceiling, and gold wrapping paper balled up on the floor. The way the flames of the candles danced and the trail of smoke flowed up to the ceiling. My mom on the other side of the table, with a camera in her hand and a smile on her face as she clicked the button over and over again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The flash hit my eyes and I kept blinking, wishing she\u2019d stop taking pictures that would forever mark this God damn day.</p><p>\u201cMake a wish, sweetie,\u201d she said and the camera flashed again, lighting up the face of the people that surrounded the table.</p><p>I stared at the pink frosting, the \u201cHappy Birthday Callie\u201d Make a wish?</p><p>A red balloon floated over the table, slowly, up and down, up and down.</p> <p>\u201cMake a wish, Callie,\u201d my mom repeated as the balloon moved over her shoulder.</p><p>Everyone was watching me, like they could see that I wasn\u2019t whole anymore.</p><p>Make a wish? Make a wish?</p><p>The balloon popped.</p><p>There are no such things as wishes.</p> <p>My roommate, Violet, enters the room as I finish writing the last line. She\u2019s tall, with black curly hair streaked with red. Her nose is pierced and she has a tattoo of a star on the back of her neck. She has a pair of plaid pants on, a torn black t-shirt, and combat boots.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen my leather jacket?\u201d she asks as she shuts the door and tosses a bag onto her unmade bed.</p><p>I close my journal and slide the pen into the spiral. \u201cI haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She sighs as she collects her books from the desk in front of the window. \u201cI think I might have lost it at the club. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for it.\u201d I tuck the journal underneath the pillow and get up from the bed.</p><p>She opens the drawer of the desk and glances over her shoulder at me as I slip my shoes on. \u201cAre you heading out?\u201d</p> <p>I nod, easing my arm through the sleeve of a grey hoodie. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>I hear a bottle of pills rattle as she shuts the drawer and holds up a red scarf. \u201cI might have someone over tonight. I\u2019ll put this on the doorknob if I do.\u201d</p><p>Again? What does this girl do? \u201cAlright.\u201d My fingers wrap around the doorknob. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to check first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better,\u201d she says, her hand hovering near the drawer. \u201cOtherwise you\u2019re going to see something you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I walk out the door, wishing I had my own dorm room.</p><p>\u201cI think I just got myself in over my head,\u201d I tell Seth as he lets me in his room. \u201cLike really bad.\u201d</p><p>Seth pauses the television screen, sits down on the bed, and pats the spot beside him. \u201cCome sit down and spill your problem.\u201d</p><p>I let my bag fall to the floor and sink down onto the bed. \u201cKayden asked me to go to a club with him and Luke tonight, and I accidentally said yes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you accidentally say yes to something like that?\u201d</p><p>I huff out a breath of frustration. \u201cHe kept smiling at me and getting me all flustered and I couldn\u2019t think straight.\u201d</p><p>Seth grins and a giggle escapes his lips. \u201cOh my God, you have a crush on him.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, getting flustered just by the thought. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The mattress concaves beneath me as he bounces up and down like a little kid with too much sugar in their system. \u201cYes, you do. You have your very first crush, Callie. How exciting!\u201d</p><p>Still shaking my head, I sit up and smooth my hair away from my forehead. \u201cI don\u2019t have a crush on him. Is he good looking? Of course. And he\u2019s known that since we were in third grade.\u201d I pause, getting agitated. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had crushes before, just not for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou so have a crush on him.\u201d He picks up the remote and turns off the television. \u201cThis will be good, and then we can cross number five off on the list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dancing,\u201d I argue, cringing. \u201cDancing equals touching and getting close to people. I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. You\u2019ve done it with me like a hundred times,\u201d he encourages. \u201cI mean, think about when we first met. You would barely talk to me and you always looked like you were going to stab me with a pencil or something. Now look at you. You\u2019re sitting on my bed in my room, just you and I. You\u2019ve come so far my little Callie Girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re you.\u201d I sigh, discouraged. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I had to earn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I\u2019m so sorry for making you do that. I\u2019m surprised you stuck around like you did.\u201d</p><p>He hops off the bed and opens the top dresser drawer. \u201cWhatever. You were so worth it.\u201d</p><p>I swing my feet over the edge of the bed. \u201cYou seem really happy today.\u201d</p><p>He takes out a green button down shirt with a front pocket and holds it out in front of him. \u201cYou remember that guy I was telling you about? The one in my Sociology class?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cThe one with the really soft looking hair and pretty blue eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d He walks over to the mirror, fussing with his hair as he inches his face closer to the reflection. \u201cHe talked to me today and I mean really talked to me for more than five minutes.\u201d</p><p>I scoot off the bed and pick up a marker from a cup on his nightstand. \u201cDo you think he likes you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, clamping his jaw shut to keep from smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell who he likes, but maybe if I talk to him more.\u201d</p><p>I work to get the cap off with my teeth and then spit it out on the bed. \u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>He tugs the shirt over his head, wiggling his arms through the sleeves and then rearranges his hair back into place with his fingers. \u201cYeah, with you to a club.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders relax as I go over to the board on the back of the door with a very long list drawn on it, with very little numbers crossed off. \u201cAre you going to be okay? I mean, I know how you feel about football players, considering what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>He fastens a leather watch to his wrist. \u201cThat Luke guy seems pretty nice. At least he was during our ten minute conversation when we were out smoking and I think he knows about me.\u201d</p><p>I put the tip of the marker up to the board. \u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got a vibe,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seemed like he didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>I scratch off number five very slowly and the marker squeaks. \u201cBut I\u2019m only dancing with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a great plan to me.\u201d He offers me his elbow and I link my arm with his, feeling safe with him by my side as we saunter down the hall to go outside.</p><p>It\u2019s late, the sky is black, and the stars look like pieces of shimmering glass. Crickets chirp in the damp grass and there\u2019s a couple sitting on one of the benches kissing each other fervently. It makes me blush a little because for a split second I picture Kayden and I in their places.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have that look on your face?\u201d Seth wonders observantly.</p><p>I look away at the road. \u201cWhat look?\u201d</p><p>He sighs, but doesn\u2019t press. When we reach the grass, he stops moving his feet and pulls me back, his eyes darting to my face. \u201cWait a second.\u201d</p><p>I touch my hair self-consciously. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do I have something in my hair?\u201d</p><p>He slants his head to the side and then his hand snaps out, his fingers snagging my hair. With one swift yank, he\u2019s torn the elastic from my hair and strands fall to my shoulders. \u201cThere we go. Let that freaking hair of yours down.\u201d</p><p>I gather my hair behind my head and stick out my hand. \u201cGive me that back, Seth.\u201d</p><p>Batting his eyelashes, he raises his hand and stretches the elastic on two of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I warn, lunging for him. \u201cPlease, Seth, don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>He flicks his thumb so the elastic flings through the air into the darkness. \u201cWhoops.\u201d</p><p>I drag my fingers along my face as I hunch over and search the damp grass for the elastic. \u201cWhere the fuck is it?\u201d</p><p>Seth laughs. \u201cHoly shit, the swear words are coming out.\u201d</p><p>I stand up and glare at him with rage burning in my eyes as I work to tie the strands of my hair into a knot. \u201cI need to get my hair up. Please help me find it.\u201d Tears sting at the corners of my eyes. \u201cGod dammit Seth, where the fuck is it?\u201d</p><p>His expression falls and his skin drains of color as he realizes he might have pushed the wrong button. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to find it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as tears bubble out of my eyes and trail down my cheeks. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe,\u201d I gasp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hair smells so good, Callie,\u201d he says, twisting a strand of my long brown hair around his finger. \u201cLike strawberries.\u201d</p><p>My chest constricts as I start to sob. In three short strides, he has his arms encircled around my shoulders and is drawing me into him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t realize the hair thing was that big of a deal. I thought it was more of a complex.\u201d</p><p>I wipe the tears away with my fingers and suck in a slow breath through my nose to regain control over my fear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just... it brings back things I don\u2019t want to remember.\u201d</p><p>He leans away and threads his fingers through mine, squeezing my hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay, I promise. I\u2019ll be right by you the whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I have time to run back to my room.\u201d I glance at the doors, right as Kayden and Luke come strolling around the corner of the dorm building.</p><p>Luke is a little smaller than Kayden, with shorter hair, and a face without scars. He has a plaid shirt on, a pair of faded jeans with a black leather belt and boots on his feet. Kayden\u2019s hair is tousled with stray pieces hanging in his eyes and he has on a hooded black thermal shirt, with dark jeans that ride extremely low on his hips. I bet when he raises his arms above his head his stomach will show.</p><p>\u201cCallie, you\u2019re staring,\u201d Seth hisses under his breath and prods me in the ribcage with his elbow.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I blink at him as I wipe the last of the tears away from my cheeks, surprised how calm I\u2019ve become.</p><p>He presses his lips together, containing a smile. \u201cYou were staring at a particular someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d I deny. \u201cWas I?\u201d</p><p>He nods his head once and then hisses through his teeth, \u201cYou were and your mouth was hanging open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kayden says and his forehead creases at my tear-stained face. \u201cWere you two just arguing?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and glance at Seth. \u201cNo, we were just talking heatedly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d He eyes me with skepticism. \u201cShould we get going?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I step aside so him and Luke can walk between us and lead the way.</p><p>Seth pulls his cigarettes out of his pocket and pops one into his mouth as we trail behind them. \u201cAre we riding with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I swing my gaze over to the rusted single cab truck where no other vehicles are parked. \u201cNot unless they want to ride in your car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s offer to drive then,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then you can be our DD since you never ever drink. Although, you should try it tonight. It\u2019ll probably calm you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drank a beer that one time,\u201d I protest. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t relax me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my na\u00efve little Callie.\u201d He sighs, retrieving his lighter from his pocket. \u201cOne beer isn\u2019t going to do much to you. You need something with a kick. Something potent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t drink at the club,\u201d I say as he flicks the lighter with his thumb. Cupping his other hand around the flame, he lights the end of the cigarette and the paper burns and crinkles. \u201cRemember what happened the last time you tried that at a club?\u201d</p><p>He sucks in a breath, inhaling the smoke, before puffing it out in front of his face. \u201cYeah, excellent point. Don\u2019t want to go back into the holding cell again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky it was your birthday and they let you off the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also flirted with one of the officers.\u201d He grins as a thin trail of smoke snakes out of his lips.</p> <p>\u201cSo, who wants to sit on whose lap?\u201d Kayden asks with his hand on the open door of the truck. His eyes are on me and there\u2019s a hint of amusement on his lips. \u201cPersonally, I think there\u2019s only one option here.\u201d</p><p>I point at Seth\u2019s black Camry parked a few spots down. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to take Seth\u2019s car. You guys can ride with us if you want.\u201d</p><p>Luke tosses the keys up in the air like a baseball and then catches them in his hand. \u201cSounds good to me. That way, I don\u2019t have to be responsible for driving.\u201d</p><p>I was kind of hoping they wouldn\u2019t ride with us so Seth could give me a speech of encouragement and I could put my hair up with something because the way it touches my shoulders and the smell of it\u2019s driving me crazy. I have the urge to run back to my room and hack it all off again.</p><p>As we walk over to Seth\u2019s car, I comb my fingers through my hair trying to get it manageable and out of the way. I reach for the passenger door, but Luke\u2019s arm extends out and he opens the door for me. Moving to the side, I elude around him like I\u2019m dancing, when really it\u2019s just to keep my distance.</p> <p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I catch Seth\u2019s eye over the roof of the car and he arches an eyebrow as we climb in.</p><p>Seth slams the door and I jolt in the seat. \u201cRelax Callie,\u201d he whispers as he turns the key and the engine purrs to life. Rolling down the window, he puts his hand outside so the smoke doesn\u2019t fill the cab. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>Seth and Kayden hop into the back seat from opposite sides of the car and their doors slam simultaneously. Seth turns the stereo on as we buckle our seatbelts. \u201cHurt\u201d by Nine Inch Nails turns on and he presses on the pedal, ripping the tires against the wet pavement. The car lurches forward and I grab onto the door handle. Seth is a crazy driver. He has a drawer full of tickets and when he was a teenager, his parents took away his car twice, because he kept wrecking it. He always seems to be in a hurry, like he kind of is with life.</p><p>Luke leans forward, bracing his hand on the back of my seat, and I angle my head to the side. \u201cCan I smoke in here, man?\u201d he asks Seth.</p><p>Seth raises his cigarette, which is burnt almost to the end. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>A smile curves at Luke\u2019s lips as he slumps back in the seat. Seconds later there\u2019s a flick of a lighter, the window rolls down, and a cool breeze blows in.</p> <p>After Luke gives Seth directions, no one speaks for a while and I worry that the night is going to end in a tragic silence. Then Kayden scoots forward and props his arms on the console.</p><p>\u201cLuke and I have this brilliant idea,\u201d he says and the glow from the buildings reflects in his eyes. \u201cYou remember that rock we climbed up to? The one that all the seniors go and tag?\u201d</p><p>I revolve sideways in the seat and bring my leg up onto the leather. \u201cYes, I remember.\u201d</p><p>He leans his weight on his arms, slanting even closer to me, and my heart leaps in my chest. \u201cWell, we want to go up there and tag it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not seniors.\u201d I adjust my seatbelt on my shoulder. \u201cWell, duh, I guess you already knew that.\u201d</p><p>He laughs at me in an amused tone. \u201cWe do know that, which makes it fun.\u201d</p><p>Luke peeks over the top of the seat with his arm to the side so the trail of smoke is blowing out the window. \u201cWe used to crash senior parties all the time back in high school. It was a blast because they weren\u2019t too fond of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked upsetting them?\u201d I ask and he tilts his head sideways so he won\u2019t blow smoke in my face.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, it was pretty fun.\u201d Luke sticks his cigarette out the window, brushes the pad of his thumb on the bottom, and the ashes blow outside. \u201cTo mess with someone\u2019s mind instead of being the one messed with.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like he\u2019s told me an unsolvable riddle and I glance to Kayden for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cIt is pretty entertaining,\u201d he promises me with a wink. \u201cWe were thinking we could drive up to the rock and put something on it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s late.\u201d I glance at the bright red numbers on the clock and then at Seth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Seth veers onto a slender side road that squeezes between two-story brick buildings.</p><p>There are people walking up and down the sidewalk. Most of the girls are wearing skimpy dresses and high heels, and the guys have on nice jeans and shirts. I look down at my converses, my black skinny jeans, and the fitted white t-shirt beneath my unzipped jacket. I feel underdressed and silly for being here.</p><p>Seth turns into a small parking spot and squishes the car into it. It's a tight fit and I have to crack the car door open and maneuver out. Luke rolls down his window, sticks his head out, and putting his hands onto the roof, heaves his body out the open window.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lot skinnier than I am.\u201d He props up on his toes and jumps to the ground. \u201cMy dumb ass would have gotten stuck in the door.</p><p>Smiling, I walk around to the front of the car where Seth is waiting for me with his elbow extended out. There\u2019s a lanky guy with sores on his face and long black hair leaning against a lamppost near the street.</p><p>He eyes me as he sips from a beer bottle and when he moves it away from his lips, the look he gives me sends a chill through my body. \u201cHey there sexy,\u201d he slurs, stepping away from the curb before stumbling right back. \u201cYou look fucking fine tonight.\u201d</p><p>I start to run back to the car, but Seth\u2019s fingers enclose around my elbow. \u201cAre you talking to her or me, because I just can\u2019t tell,\u201d he smarts off to the guy.</p><p>The guy\u2019s dark eyes turn cold with the need to conquer someone. I\u2019ve seen that look before and it makes me gag; filling my body with a toxic feeling of revulsion, distrust, and shame.</p><p>The drunken man shifts his body forward and wobbles toward us. \u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking kick your ass for that.\u201d</p><p>I jerk on Seth\u2019s arm, ready to run, jump into the car, lock all the doors, and cower on the floor. \u201cPlease let\u2019s just go back to the car, Seth.\u201d</p><p>Kayden steps up beside us, his fingers brushing up the inside of my arm, and the man\u2019s eyes rise to meet his. His shoulders stiffen as he halts, his shoes scuffing against the gravel on the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cShut your fucking drunken mouth, turn around, and go home,\u201d Kayden orders calmly pointing his finger down the street.</p><p>The man\u2019s chapped lips part, but then he fastens his jaw shut as he takes in the sight of Kayden\u2019s broad shoulders and height. He tosses the beer bottle out into the street where it shatters into pieces across the asphalt and then he drags his feet as he staggers toward the corner.</p><p>Seth and I blow out a breath of relief, our eyes wide as we stare at each other in shock.</p><p>Seth turns to Kayden. \u201cYou\u2019re like a knight in shining armor.\u201d</p><p>I catch a faint hint of Kayden\u2019s musky scent mixed with cologne. From now on, whenever I smell it I\u2019ll come back to this moment when I felt protected. \u201cThank you,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>He smiles, leaning down so his face is near mine. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>We head up the sidewalk with Seth and me in the front and Luke and Kayden in the back. Luke keeps whispering to Kayden and then suddenly we hear a grunt. When I turn around, Luke is hunched over, cradling his gut.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking asshole,\u201d he growls and he collapses onto his knees.</p><p>My eyes bulge as he stands up straight and prowls toward Kayden, raising his fists. Kayden does nothing but stand there with a stoic look on his face.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d I cry, instinctively stepping for him as the memories of that night when his father beat the shit out of him surface.</p><p>Luke surrenders his hands out in front of him and steps back from Kayden. \u201cCallie, I was just messing with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I cover my hand over my mouth, feeling like an idiot. The drunken man has put my nerves up way too high.</p><p>Kayden shoots a piercing look at Luke as he edges toward me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he says cautiously. \u201cLuke was just giving me a hard time about something so I hit him in the stomach as a joke. The whole thing was a joke.\u201d</p><p>I free a breath imprisoned in my chest. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sorry. I just thought he was going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry.\u201d He glances at Seth then back at me and his shoulder shifts forward as he wraps an arm around my shoulder.</p><p>I tense from the rush of his touch and the fear of it. It feels so much more personal then when we were climbing up the cliff, because there\u2019s no point to it except to touch each other.</p><p>I look to Seth for help, but he mouths, relax and breathe.</p><p>I order my erratic heart to shut the hell up and even though it doesn\u2019t listen, I manage to make it all the way to the door of the club with Kayden\u2019s arm around my shoulder. It\u2019s something new, fresh, and raw. While being insignificant, it\u2019s momentous and a contradiction in itself.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>Callie is the most skittish person I\u2019ve ever met, which says a lot since every time my dad would raise his voice, my brothers and I would scatter around the house and hide while we were being hunted.</p><p>Luke was giving me shit about checking out her ass, which I was, but I couldn\u2019t help it. She\u2019s so tiny and the way she swings her hips is captivating and kind of sexy, although she\u2019s probably not doing it on purpose.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get yourself into a lot of trouble,\u201d Luke remarks as we walk just a ways behind them.</p><p>I transfer my gaze off Callie\u2019s ass and scowl at Luke. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He points a finger at Callie with an accusing look on his face. \u201cBecause of her right there. Do you know what Daisy would do if you ever cheated on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove on to the next guy that told her she had nice tits.\u201d I stuff my hands into my pockets and step around a pole.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re probably right on that one,\u201d he says and aims his finger at Callie again. \u201cBut do you know what Daisy would do to Callie if she ever found out there was something going on between you two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, frustrated. \u201cShe\u2019s not like that. She\u2019s sweet and... innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous combination for someone like you.\u201d He reaches for the pack of cigarettes in his front pocket. \u201cI\u2019m totally rooting that you find someone else, because I fucking hate Daisy. Just break up with her first and don\u2019t bring Callie into it. She seems sad.\u201d He swallows hard. \u201cShe kind of reminds me of Amy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amy is Luke\u2019s older sister, who took her own life at the age of sixteen. He was never the same after her death. I wonder what happened to bring Amy to the bottom, what made her want her life to be over.</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019m not going to bring Callie into anything.\u201d I kick an empty cup across the road.</p><p>\u201cJust think with your head.\u201d He smirks. \u201cAnd not with your dick.\u201d</p><p>I swing my arm out to my side and my elbow smashes into his gut, hard enough that it\u2019ll annoy him, but not hurt him. \u201cI\u2019m not breaking up with her and there\u2019s nothing going on between Callie and me.\u201d</p> <p>He lets out a grunt as he clutches his stomach. I\u2019m about ready to laugh at him when Callie spins around looking terrified. I feel like an asshole. It only gets worse when Luke charges at me, and she just about jumps in between us. I question if she was thinking back to that night that she saved me or if she\u2019s the kind of girl that just wants to save everyone.</p><p>I want to comfort her so I do something I shouldn\u2019t. I put an arm around her shoulder and her muscles constrict so tightly that I worry she\u2019s going to crumble to the ground. It\u2019s different from the cliff because there are no excuses, yet she lets me hold her like that until we get into the club, then she quickly steps away as the music and smoke engulf us.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so loud in here,\u201d she remarks, as she gapes at the people dancing in the middle of the room, writhing their hips, and pressing their sweaty bodies together. Neon lights flash across their horny faces and it\u2019s practically like watching porn.</p><p>It\u2019s a little much even for Luke and me, but we still go search the room for a vacant table, pushing our way through the mob of people. Seth and Luke instantly light up once we\u2019re settled in a corner booth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get the drinks,\u201d Luke says sliding toward the end of the seat. \u201cSince I\u2019m the only one with an ID, unless you have yours on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you my dad found it while we were packing up my stuff.\u201d I pick up the menu that\u2019s in the middle of the table. \u201cHe cut it up.\u201d</p><p>From across the table, Callie peers up at me. I flip open my menu to avoid her penetrating gaze. \u201cWhat do we want to order? Should we get an appetizer or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to use the little girl\u2019s room,\u201d Seth announces and Callie giggles at him. \u201cCome with me Callie.\u201d</p><p>She takes his hand and follows him without even questioning. It leaves me scratching my head. She trusts him so much and everyone else so little. For a brief moment, I picture what it would be like for someone like her to trust me, but I have too many twisted secrets locked away inside me for that to ever happen.</p><p>Callie</p><p>\u201cHoly Jesus.\u201d Once we\u2019re inside the restroom, Seth whirls around and places his hands on his hips. \u201cThat was ridiculously sexy.\u201d</p> <p>I turn on the faucet and place my hands underneath the warm water. \u201cWhat was?\u201d</p><p>He walks up beside me, capturing my gaze as he clears his throat accusingly. \u201cThe way he stepped up to save us.\u201d</p><p>I shut off the water and wave my hand in front of the paper towel device. \u201cIt was very nice of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie Lawrence, you let him put his arm around you,\u201d he states. \u201cIt was more than nice for you. God, I\u2019m so jealous.\u201d</p><p>I grab a paper towel and run it along my hands. \u201cHe made me feel safe for a minute,\u201d I admit, tossing the towel into the trashcan.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a big step for you,\u201d he says.</p><p>I nod my head an excessive amount of times. \u201cI know it is.\u201d</p><p>His lips spread to a massive grin. \u201cShould we go out and have some fun?\u201d</p> <p>One of the stall doors swings open and a fortyish-year-old woman walks out tucking her shirt into her jeans. Her heavy lined eyes land on Seth. \u201cThis is the women\u2019s restroom.\u201d She points a finger at the door. \u201cCan\u2019t you read?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see that everyone in this club is about twenty years younger than you?\u201d Seth retorts, turning to the mirror. With his pinkie, he messes with his bangs. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll excuse us, we\u2019re going to have some fun.\u201d</p><p>He grabs my arm and I offer the woman an apologetic smile before stumbling over my own feet as I hurry to keep up with Seth. He bangs his hand against the door and shoves it open, moving us to the outside. The smoke and noise instantly shatter around me as his fingers leave my arm.</p><p>\u201cCan you believe her,\u201d he says, patting his pocket for his cigarettes. \u201cWhat a bitch!\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t argue with him. He has a thing with being treated as an equal. \u201cI think you left your cigarettes at the table,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>We wind our way around the dance floor where an erotic song is playing. People have their hands all over each other, skin to skin, and watching it gives me a headache.</p><p>At the table, there are four shot glasses filled with clear liquid. Alongside each shot is a taller cup full of a brownish liquid with a lemon slice floating on the top.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what everyone wanted to drink,\u201d Luke explains as Seth lifts the shot to eyelevel and peers through the distorted glass. \u201cSo I just ordered vodka shots and Long Island Iced Teas. So we have intense and semi-intense.\u201d</p><p>Seth glances at me from the corner of his eyes. \u201cLooks good to me.\u201d He raises the shot glass in the air. \u201cShould we make a toast?\u201d</p><p>I direct my attention to the dance floor so I won\u2019t be scrutinized and watch a girl jump up and down with her arms in the air, trying to maintain her balance in the neon pink stilettoes on her feet. The guy she\u2019s with is shaking his head at her, laughing.</p><p>\u201cCallie, did you hear what Luke asked you?\u201d Seth\u2019s concerned voice flows over my shoulder.</p><p>Ripping my gaze away from the dance floor, I concentrate on Seth\u2019s bloodshot eyes and the small glass in his hand. \u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to know if you were going to join us?\u201d he asks with pressing eyes.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Luke smacks his hand on the table and the vibration tips over the salt and pepper shakers. \u201cThere\u2019s an unwritten rule that you have to make a toast if it\u2019s proposed.\u201d</p><p>I stand the shakers back up and sweep the spilt salt off the table. \u201cSomeone has to drive us all home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get a cab,\u201d Luke proposes. \u201cEasy fix.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the alcohol in front of me, wondering what the big deal is with the stuff, because with the beer I felt nothing. \u201cBut then you can\u2019t go spray paint the rock.\u201d</p><p>Kayden targets a warning at Luke. \u201cJust let her be, okay? If she doesn\u2019t want to, then she doesn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Setting the glass down, Seth chimes in. \u201cWe can have the cab driver drop us off and pick us up later.\u201d He leans over and cups his hand around my ear. \u201cIf you want to, then just do it. Pick up the glass and have some fun for once in your life, but if you really don\u2019t, then shake your head.\u201d</p><p>My hair is down, I let Kayden touch me, and I\u2019m sitting in a place bursting with sexual tension. It\u2019s the most challenging night I\u2019ve had in terms of facing my fears, so I wrap my fingers around the glass and lift it up in front of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell,\u201d I say over the music. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a cab.\u201d</p><p>Seth claps his hands and scoops up the shot. \u201cHell yeah!\u201d</p><p>Kayden laughs at Seth and then inclines over the table toward me. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re good? You don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>I nod with assurance. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I promise\u201d</p><p>Seth levels his arm so his glass is just above the center of the table, right below the domed light. \u201cBottoms up.\u201d</p><p>Luke puts his hand up, and Kayden and I follow.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t someone say something like meaningful or something?\u201d Seth asks. \u201cThat\u2019s what toasts are for.\u201d</p><p>Luke cocks his head to the side, tapping his fingers on the table. \u201cTo getting away.\u201d</p><p>Seth grins at me. \u201cTo acceptance.\u201d</p><p>Kayden bites at his bottom lip with his eyelids lowered. \u201cTo feeling alive.\u201d</p><p>The three of them fasten their eyes on me and I glance to Seth for help.</p><p>\u201cThis is your thing, Callie,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhatever you want to say, just say it.\u201d</p><p>I suck in a breath and release it out gradually. \u201cTo being able to breathe.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment that passes between Kayden and me as our expressions match. Then the four of us clink glasses.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Seth spills some of his on his hand and he licks it off. Tipping his head back, he pours the shot into his mouth. Then he slams the glass down and points at it. \u201cI\u2019m already ready for round two.\u201d</p><p>Kayden watches me as he moves the glass to his lips, arches his neck back, and gulps it down. I observe his neck muscles as they move to force the alcohol down. He lifts his head back up and licks his lips with his gaze attached to mine.</p><p>Inhaling deeply, I position the rim to my mouth, and the stench burns my nose as I let my head fall back and suck out the drink. The hot liquid spills down my throat and the heat is almost unbearable. As I bring the glass away from my mouth, my gag reflex kicks in and I choke on the burn, but keep my lips sealed, forcing the alcohol down. My shoulders heave as a strangled sound bursts from my lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna make it?\u201d Luke wonders, setting his glass down on the table.</p><p>Seth gives me a gentle pat on the back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I choke, with my palm pressed to my chest.</p><p>\u201cCallie is a newbie,\u201d Seth explains as he takes a swallow of the Long Island Iced Tea.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never drank before?\u201d Kayden gapes at me. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>I feel stupid as I shrug my shoulders. \u201cNo, nothing this hard anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you do it tonight?\u201d he asks, looking guilty. \u201cDid we pressure you too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wanted to try it.\u201d I wipe my lips with the back of my hand.</p><p>His eyebrows furrow and a hint of a smile curves at his lips. \u201cWas it on your list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Seth exclaims over the loud music, slamming his hand on the table. \u201cYou told him about the list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him of the list,\u201d I explain, stirring the straw around in my drink, watching the lemon go around and around. When I peek up through my hair, Kayden is observing me curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat list?\u201d Luke wraps his lips around the straw and sips at his drink.</p><p>Seth and I trade a glance and then he shoos me with his hands to move off the seat. \u201cHow about you and I go dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m in. Just don\u2019t do any of those weird moves again. Last time I fell on my butt.\u201d I adjust my shirt over my stomach as I get to my feet.</p><p>Laying a hand on the small of my back, Seth steers us toward the dance floor. He\u2019s done this a couple of times with me, so he understands what he\u2019s in store for; lots of panicking and a whole lot of clinginess.</p><p>He selects a section at the side of the dance floor where there are less people and the atmosphere is mellower. A slow song plays from the speakers and the lights stop flickering and settle to a pale glow. Seth looks ghostly white underneath them and his honey brown eyes look black as he puts his hands on my hips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I pushed you too hard, baby girl,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI feel bad.\u201d</p><p>I reach for his shoulders and step closer to him so the tips of our shoes are touching. \u201cYou didn\u2019t pressure me, although, you could have warned me that it was going to burn that bad. Then I would have tried harder not to choke and not look like a complete moron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, neither of them think you\u2019re a moron.\u201d He laughs, like he knows a secret. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose all that trust I\u2019ve earned with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t lose anything.\u201d I squeeze his shoulders with my fingertips, inching in as a guy in a fedora rams into my back. \u201cThe day you told me all your secrets was the day I knew we\u2019d be friends forever. You\u2019re the bravest person I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles brightly and draws me closer. \u201cAre you feeling okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel fine,\u201d I tell him and rest my cheek against his. \u201cAlthough, I'm a little iffy on going up to the cliff with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople go up there all the time. We won\u2019t be the only ones there. You need to stop thinking of every guy as being like him, otherwise, he\u2019ll always own you.\u201d</p><p>I blow out a breath. He\u2019s right. I need to let go of my fears and rid my brain of the guy who instilled them, but how can I let go of the one person who holds such a huge part of me?</p><p>Kayden</p> <p>I can\u2019t take my eyes off the dance floor. Even when my phone vibrates from inside my pocket, I slip my hand into it and press the off button on the side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d Luke plucks a piece of ice out of his drink and pops it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d I ask, distracted as my heart thumps when Callie throws back her head and laughs.</p><p>A hand knocks against the side of my head and my hand shoots up. \u201cOkay, what the fuck was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s payback for when you hit me back on the curb,\u201d he says and his eyes roam to a girl with long red hair strutting by our table in a short black dress. \u201cAnd it was also to distract you from doing something really stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d I say. \u201cI was just watching people dance.\u201d</p> <p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cDo everyone a favor and send Daisy a text to break up with her. Then you can do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to break up with her in a text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you care. You don\u2019t care about her even though you tell her you love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem with her, besides the fact that she annoys the shit out of you?\u201d</p><p>He tosses his straw onto the table, grabs the cup, and pours the rest of the Long Island Iced Tea down his throat. \u201cI\u2019m going to go buy another round.\u201d</p><p>I let him out, and then start to lower myself back into the booth, but my eyes find Callie again. She\u2019s smiling as she talks to Seth. I\u2019ve never been that happy before about anything. It makes no sense to me and maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m drawn to her.</p><p>Even though I shouldn\u2019t, I move across the dance floor, turning sideways to fit through the couples dancing, and getting rubbed on by a couple of girls along the way. Seth\u2019s eyes locate me first and he whispers something into Callie\u2019s ear.</p><p>Turning her head, she looks at me and her eyelids lift slightly. Her pupils look huge below the hazy lights, her skin pale, and her hair soft.</p> <p>\u201cMind if I cut in?\u201d I ask over the music.</p><p>Seth lets go of her hips. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d He winks at Callie and walks backwards off the dance floor, turning as he arrives at the edge, where the crowd closes in.</p><p>Callie\u2019s gaze lingers in the spot he vanished from, her shoulders stiff and her fingers tucked into her palms.</p><p>I put my lips beside her ear. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to dance with me, if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders jolt upward and she rotates her tiny body to face me. Her gaze scrolls up my legs, my stomach, and it makes me kind of uncomfortable. She knows where my scars are hidden and she\u2019s the kind of person who wonders things.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We can dance.\u201d Her nerves show through the shakiness of her voice.</p><p>I hold out my hand and she wavers before placing her palm on top of mine. Enclosing my fingers around her hand, I slowly lure her body toward mine with my eyes fixed on hers. She\u2019s looking at me helplessly, like she\u2019s praying I won\u2019t hurt her. It takes me back to a time when I was younger and my father was furious with me because I\u2019d knocked a vase off the shelf. He came at me with a belt in his hand and rage in his eyes as I dove under the table trying to hide. The cuts from the previous days beating hadn\u2019t healed yet, and all I could do was hope he didn\u2019t kill me.</p><p>\u201cCan I put my hand on your hip?\u201d I ask and she nods.</p><p>I spread my fingers around her waist and her eyes get a little wider, especially when I position my other hand on her side. I listen to my heart thud inside my chest, louder than the music. I\u2019m feeling things I haven\u2019t felt before and I might be getting in over my head. What if I continue to get to know her and the feelings amplify? I don\u2019t deal with feelings.</p><p>She unwinds a little as her hands glide up my chest and hook around my neck, her head angling back so she can look up at me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really like to dance,\u201d I admit. \u201cI kind of developed a fear of it when I was little.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitch upward. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Digging my fingertips gently into her hips, I draw her toward me so our feet touch and I feel the heat of her breath on my neck. \u201cWhen I was ten, my mom went through this dance faze where she took all kinds of dance classes and when she practiced at home, she liked to use my brothers and I as her partners. I\u2019ve hated dancing ever since.\u201d</p><p>She smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s cute that you danced around with your mom.\u201d</p><p>My fingers inch around her back and graze the sliver of skin between the top of her jeans and the bottom of her shirt. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone that. I have a reputation to uphold. At least I did back home. Here I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d</p><p>Her smile expands as her head tips forward and pieces of her hair veil around her face. \u201cIt can be our little secret.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly as she looks back up at me. She seems happy. As the music shifts to an upbeat rhythm, I decide to show off, just to keep her smiling.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d I warn.</p><p>She bites down on her lip, and the urge to kiss her compresses at my heart. Suddenly, I can\u2019t decide whether to leave her there on the dance floor, or continue to show off.</p><p>Shoving her away, I glide my hand up her arm until our fingers interlace. Her eyes widen as I yank her back toward me and twist her around, before colliding her body into mine. Her lips are inches away from my mouth as her heaving chest brushes against mine.</p><p>\u201cDo you want more?\u201d I ask in a low voice, hoping to make her shiver.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t shiver, but she nods with excitement gleaming in her blue eyes. My palm slides down her back possessively, feeling the heat of her skin emitting through the thin fabric of her shirt. I pull her hand forward and tip her body backward. Her hair dangles to the floor, her back arches, and I have the perfect view of her tits and the sliver of skin peeking out from the bottom of her top. Taking a deep breath, I glide my hand up her back, until she\u2019s standing upright with her chest pressed against mine again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about that either,\u201d I whisper in her ear with my arms around her waist.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, breathless, her fingers gripping my shoulder blades.</p><p>I continue moving with her in my arms until the end of the song, and then we let go of one another and go back to the table as if nothing happened. Something did, though, but I\u2019m not sure whether to pursue it or run like hell.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>#3 Try to be Happy</p><p>#3 Be Stupidly, Drunk Happy</p><p>Callie</p><p>I\u2019m happy, like stupidly happy. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I have a buzz or because it has been a good night. I\u2019ve accomplished what I thought was impossible and I am so proud of myself that I practically skip to the cab. I danced with Kayden, let him touch me in a way no one ever has\u2014at least with my permission\u2014and I liked it!</p><p>Seth and I take the backseat in the van and Kayden tells the cab driver where to go. The inside smells like old cheese overlapped with a pine scent. The cab driver is a round guy in his fifties who doesn\u2019t look that thrilled to have four loud eighteen year-olds in the car. There is some 80\u2019s music playing in the background and Seth keeps giggling about the lyrics, telling me they are secretly dirty and talking about pussy.</p><p>Luke overhears him and rotates around in his seat. \u201cIs it really talking about that?</p><p>Seth points at the speakers. \u201cListen to them.\u201d</p><p>We sit quietly, staring at the speaker, listening to the lyrics. Seth balls his hand into a fist and puts it up to his lips like a microphone as he begins mouthing the words.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this song?\u201d I wonder. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of music that you listen to.\u201d</p><p>He grins, leaning in, finishing out the lyrics. \u201cMy dad is a total 80\u2019s freak. He has the mullet and everything.\u201d</p><p>I giggle as he does this weird jiving movement with his hips.</p><p>\u201cIt is talking about pussy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Luke declares and the cab driver cranks up the stereo to muffle out our conversation.</p><p>My cheeks heat and I turn my head toward the window, pulling the top of my shirt over my nose to hide my laughing. I shouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny, but I do.</p><p>\u201cOh, Callie\u2019s drunk,\u201d Seth announces as he lets his hands fall to his lap. \u201cDid you finish off the Long Island Iced Tea?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and let my shirt fall off my nose. \u201cOnly half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLightweight,\u201d Kayden teases me with a grin and my blush magnifies.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s her first time,\u201d Seth protests in my defense, patting my head like I\u2019m a dog. \u201cShe did good. In fact, she did great.\u201d</p><p>I turn toward the window, knowing what he means, and loving him for saying it.</p><p>\u201cI feel like we\u2019re going to get robbed,\u201d Seth whispers as we head toward a store that is located near the foothills of the mountains. We decided to stop and get some flashlights and spray paint before proceeding with our plan, otherwise, it\u2019d be a pointless journey.</p><p>There\u2019s a group of guys in front smoking cigarettes. They watch the four of us walk across the parking lot, through the sliding glass doors, and into the store.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s supposed to be a dollar in here.\u201d Luke grabs a shot glass on a display just in front of the doors and peers at the bottom. A piece of glass falls from the rim and he hastily sets it down. \u201cYeah, I can see why.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s some funky music playing from the ceiling and Seth bobs his head as he walks to a shelf and picks up a hideous orange and brown scarf.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I remember my grandma wearing something like this.\u201d He shawls it around his neck and skips up the aisle, examining the shelves.</p><p>\u201cWe should split up,\u201d Luke states. \u201cAnd look for flashlights and spray paint. It\u2019ll make it faster.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr we could just ask the cashier for some help.\u201d I peek over my shoulder at a register where a tall, thick-necked guy with the hardest look on his face watches us. \u201cOr not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make it a race,\u201d Kayden announces, jumping up to slam his hand against one of the red sale banners on the ceiling. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s drunk, because I don\u2019t know him well enough, but he seems a little off balance. \u201cFirst person to find the stuff is the winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a fantastic fucking prize,\u201d Luke remarks sarcastically, peering down an aisle. \u201cHow about loser has to buy drinks the next time we\u2019re out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan to me.\u201d Seth joins us, untying the scarf and tossing it aside on the shelf. \u201cI say we do this.\u201d</p> <p>Kayden and Luke raise their hands above my head to high-five each other and then aim their palms at me. I gently tap my palms against theirs and Kayden laughs at me as my arms fall to my sides.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d I wonder, but he just shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cAlright, so here are the rules.\u201d Luke marches back and forth in front of us like he\u2019s a director. \u201cThe rules are that there are none except to be the first one up to the checkout stand with four flashlights and a can of paint. Last one up there is a loser.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh. Is this what people do to have fun?</p><p>Luke stops walking and his eyes darken. \u201cReady, set, go.\u201d He says it quickly and then sprints off down the main aisle, his boots skidding against the linoleum before any of us can react.</p> <p>Seth skitters down one of the side aisles and Kayden dashes down the one to my right. I\u2019m left standing in the main aisle alone. I begin to walk up it, swinging my arms and reading the signs above each row.</p><p>When I reach the third one, Kayden crosses the other end and then backs up, smiling at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not trying very hard,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact, it looks like you\u2019re not trying at all.\u201d</p><p>I point above my head at the aisle number sign with the list of items. \u201cI\u2019m trying for a different approach other than running around looking like a lunatic.\u201d</p><p>He faces me and cups his hands unnecessarily around his mouth. \u201cNow what\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>I giggle. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>He moves his hand to his ear. \u201cHuh? I can\u2019t hear you. You\u2019re going to have to speak up.\u201d</p><p>Feeling silly, I cup my hands around my mouth. \u201cI said, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He lowers his hands, still smiling. \u201cCome on. You run down that side and I\u2019ll run down this one. Let\u2019s see who can beat the other one to the end.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo way. You\u2019ll win. You\u2019re the football player. You run around all the time.\u201d</p><p>He considers what I said and then snatches a roll of paper towels off the shelf. \u201cI throw more than I run.\u201d He backs up, raises the paper towel roll over his shoulder, and then flings it in my direction. It spins through the air right for me.</p><p>I stick out my arms and catch it effortlessly. His arms drop to his side as he gapes at me. \u201cWell, someone has a hidden talent.\u201d</p><p>I lift the paper towel roll over my shoulder and throw it back at him. \u201cMy dad is a coach.\u201d He catches it and slants his head, looking at me with interest as I continue, \u201cI started playing catch with him and my brother when I was like three.\u201d</p><p>Keeping his eyes on me, he returns the roll of paper towels to the shelf. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s see how you can run.\u201d He darts to the side and disappears behind the shelf.</p> <p>I sidestep, moving to the next aisle, where he\u2019s waiting at the other end. Before I can say anything, he hurries out of my view again and I take a couple of rushed steps until I\u2019m at the end of the next aisle. He\u2019s not there, so I practically run to the next one, catching him right as he\u2019s taking off again. I start running as laughter escapes my lips. Every time I reach the end of the aisle, he\u2019s vanishing to the other side. Finally, I spot the paint aisle and make a hurried turn down it, just as Kayden appears at the other end.</p><p>We both stop and glance at the spray paint on the bottom row in the middle of the aisle.</p><p>\u201cSeems like we\u2019ve run into a bit of a problem,\u201d he says a little winded as he meets my eyes.</p><p>My gaze skims back and forth between him and the paint, and then I sprint off toward the paint. His shoes squeak against the floor as he runs down the aisle. We arrive at the section at the same time and crash into the shelf, inadvertently knocking off a bunch of cans. I laugh as my feet stumble over the cans rolling over the floor and grab onto the shelf as I lose my balance.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Kayden\u2019s long fingers wrap around my wrist as he pulls my hand away. \u201cYou\u2019re so not winning this.\u201d</p><p>I reach toward the shelf, but he captures my hand and pulls me toward him. I twist my arms trying to get away without laughing and my foot stomps down on the floor. There\u2019s a hiss as green paint sprays over the white linoleum and my shoe.</p><p>I freeze, my eyes widening at the mess on the floor. \u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>Kayden\u2019s lips press together as he tries really hard not to laugh at me. \u201cThat was your own fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201d I bend my knee and raise my foot up. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>He sets the can in his hand down on the shelf and inches around the mess on the floor. His fingers link with mine as he tows me toward the end of the aisle.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, peeking around the corner. \u201cWe\u2019re going to walk out of here like nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>I look back at the paint and the green footprints my shoe left on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m leaving a mess all over the floor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your shoe off, then.\u201d</p><p>I slip my hand out of his, noting how sweaty my skin is, and wiggle my foot out of the sneaker. Picking it up by the shoelace, I hold it behind my back and we walk out of the aisle side by side.</p><p>Seth and Luke are near the checkout stand, looking at the candy section, with a can of paint and flashlights in their hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you two going?\u201d Luke asks and one of the flashlights falls from his arms onto the floor.</p><p>The cashier guy surveys us like a hawk as we hurry toward the doors.</p><p>Seth turns away from the candy, following us with his eyes. \u201cWhy does Callie only have one shoe on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going out to the car,\u201d Kayden says with a wave. \u201cSee you out there.\u201d</p><p>We take long strides toward the doors and rush out into the night, laughing our asses off. The cement is cold through my sock and I quickly put my shoe back on. The black fabric is speckled with green paint. I try to wipe it off by dragging my shoe along the ground, but it\u2019s not working very well.</p><p>Kayden watches me with amusement. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come off.\u201d</p><p>I frown at my shoe. \u201cMan, these were my favorite pair.\u201d</p><p>He glides the door of the taxi open, we hop in, and the cab driver shoots us an annoyed look. I scoot into the back and Kayden slams the door as he sinks down beside me.</p><p>He rests his hands on his knees as he looks at me through the dark. \u201cYou know Luke is going to call it a tie and make us both pay for drinks the next time we go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not too bad,\u201d I say. \u201cThen, at least, it\u2019s half the money.\u201d</p><p>He drapes his arm over the back of the seat and pulls his leg up. \u201cNah, he\u2019ll just order more drinks.\u201d</p><p>I attempt to focus on anything else other than the fact that his knee is touching the side of my leg. \u201cOh yeah?</p><p>He nods and his eyes travel up to the front seat. \u201cYeah, so be prepared.\u201d</p><p>I stare out the window at the dark lines of the mountains. It catches up with me. The night. The easiness. Everything. My mind drifts to thoughts I didn\u2019t know existed, like what his lips taste like, and how his muscles would feel under my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Kayden, blinking my thoughts away. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>His gaze flickers to my lips as his mouth opens, but then he cinches his jaw shut and a slow smile curves up on his lips. \u201cThat was fun.\u201d</p><p>I smile back at him. \u201cYou know what? It really was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is so fucking dark out here,\u201d Seth complains as we hike up the road. \u201cAnd dirty.\u201d</p><p>Luke has his flashlight in front of him. Seth dropped his almost the moment we got out of the cab and mine was a dud, so we are down to two.</p><p>The cab is waiting at the bottom of the path. The driver said we have twenty minutes before he leaves without us. He didn\u2019t like that we made him drive up to a mountain area where there is obviously an illegal party going on.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the mountains,\u201d Kayden says to Seth, sweeping his flashlight from side to side. \u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d</p><p>The rocks crunch under my shoes as I hold onto Seth\u2019s arm. The air is a little bit chilly and there\u2019s lightning zapping across the sky.</p><p>When we arrive at the bottom of the rock, Luke hands me the flashlight and shakes the paint can. \u201cSo, who is the bastard who gets to climb up there? It\u2019s not that far, but I\u2019m pretty wasted.\u201d</p><p>Seth sticks his hand in the air dramatically. \u201cWell, since I really am a bastard, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>I shine the light at his face and he has the deer-in-the-headlights look in his eyes, surprised I didn\u2019t know this about him. \u201cI thought you said your dad listens to 80\u2019s rock and has a mullet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy step-father,\u201d he clarifies and extends his hand toward Luke. \u201cGive me the can. I would love to put my two-cents down on that rock.\u201d</p><p>Luke drops the can into his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours, buddy.\u201d</p><p>Shaking the can, Seth strolls up to the steep rock that inclines up to the flashing grey sky. Propping his boot on a lower rock, he bounces up, grabbing onto a small lip on the side. He shifts his other foot onto the next rocky step, so both his feet are on the cliff. Tucking the spray can under his arm, he puts his other hand on the ledge and hoists himself onto it. Rolling onto his back, he stands up.</p><p>I beam the light at his back as he stares up at the rock. \u201cAre you okay up there?\u201d</p><p>He peers over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking of something infamous to write. Oh wait, I got it.\u201d Lifting the can up, he holds down the nozzle and begins to move his hand in swirls and circles. Red paint slowly stains the rock, forming letters until it\u2019s finished and then he lowers his hand.</p><p>\u201cYou can suck it,\u201d I read his words, shivering from the cold as goose bumps dot my arms. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re going to write?\u201d</p><p>He turns around with his hands on his hips. \u201cIt\u2019s what I already wrote, and if you want something better, than you can drag that tiny little ass of yours up here and write it yourself. You\u2019re the writer.\u201d</p><p>Kayden spins toward me, his hair nearly black in the pale light of the moon. He aims the light between our feet. \u201cYou write?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, aiming the flashlight over his shoulder. \u201cIn a journal.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s intrigued by this information for some bizarre reason. \u201cI can actually see that about you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run my hand up and down my arm, trying to erase the goose bumps. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, kicking the toes of his shoes at the dirt. \u201cYou always look like you\u2019re thinking deeply... Are you cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I say through chattering teeth, wishing I hadn\u2019t left my jacket in the cab. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little bit chilly.\u201d</p><p>He reaches around to the back of his neck and pulls the collar of his shirt over his head, taking it off. The black t-shirt he has on underneath rides up a little and I catch a glimpse of the jagged scars on his lower abs.</p> <p>Tugging down the bottom of his shirt, he stretches his arm out to me with his thermal shirt in his hand. \u201cHere, put this on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give me your shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly, I take it and the fabric is soft against my fingertips. I pull it over my head as Kayden runs his hands through his hair. The shirt dwarfs me and I feel small.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asks as I insert my arms through the sleeves.</p> <p>I nod, wrapping my arms around myself, enjoying the warmth, and the smell of his cologne. \u201cThank you, but aren\u2019t you going to get cold?\u201d</p><p>He smiles like he finds me amusing. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay, Callie. I promise. A little cold air is nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie!\u201d Seth hollers and I jump, whirling toward the cliff with the flashlight darting across the rocks. \u201cGet your ass up here and write something poetic.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and trudge toward the cliff with the light pointing just in front of my feet. The circle of light shows the way around the rocks and to the base of the cliff.</p><p>\u201cToss me your flashlight,\u201d Seth yells with his hands around his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll point it at you while you climb up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you miss it, it\u2019ll break,\u201d I call out, standing up on my tiptoes.</p> <p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d he says in his silly, drunk voice as he skips from side to side on the ledge, swinging his arms.</p><p>I\u2019m worried he\u2019s going to fall. \u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><p>Kayden moves up beside me with his hand held out to the side. \u201cHere give it to me. I\u2019m an excellent thrower.\u201d I put the flashlight in his palm and he tips his shoulder back, raising his arm. \u201cGo long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Seth says as Kayden\u2019s arm whips forward. He releases the flashlight and it soars through the air like it\u2019s a football.</p><p>Seth screeches as he sticks his hands out in front of him to catch the flashlight, which flickers like a firefly as it lands in his hands. It bounces out of them, hitting the ground and shuts off.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I ask as Luke comes up behind us and beams the light at the rock above. It\u2019s silent for a moment. The yells and laughter of the party below travel up to us.</p><p>Seth pops up from the rock, stretching his arm in the air with the flashlight in his hand. \u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should come down,\u201d I advise. \u201cI\u2019m worried you\u2019re going to fall.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly after you tag the rock.\u201d He flips on the flashlight and the glow illuminates across the writing behind him. \u201cNow come on.\u201d</p><p>I trek up to the rock, roll up the sleeves on Kayden\u2019s shirt, and place my hands onto the nearest ridge. Tilting my chin, I look up at the top as I bend my knee and brace it on a lower rock. Bouncing up and down on my toes, I prepare to climb up, but I hear someone move up behind me.</p><p>\u201cLet me help you,\u201d Kayden whispers in my ear, and for the first time in my life I actually shiver from the nearness of a guy.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Since I\u2019ve never been drunk before, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the alcohol relaxing me or what, but even when he places his hands onto my hips, I\u2019m okay. In fact, I\u2019m more than okay.</p><p>With the guidance of his hands, I stretch my body out and reach up to the next ledge. The rock is rough like sandpaper against my palms as I drag myself up and Kayden\u2019s hands slide down my back as he pushes me higher. Swinging my leg up, he gives me one last shove by cupping my butt, before pulling away.</p><p>My eyes widen as I roll on top of the ledge and stare up at the sky. The spots on my skin where he touched me tingle and a shiver courses through my body.</p><p>Seth appears above me, the silver bolts of lightning reflecting in his eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I flip over onto my stomach and use my hands to push myself to my feet. \u201cI\u2019m okay. No scrapes or cuts.\u201d</p><p>He beams the flashlight below his chin. It illuminates his face and causes his eyes to look like coals. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about the climb. I was talking about the fact that he just grabbed your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I saw that. He basically just groped you.\u201d</p><p>I place my hands on my hips and pace the length of the narrow cliff, kicking up dirt with the bottom of my sneakers. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Really. In fact, I feel more than okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that might be the alcohol talking.\u201d Seth holds out the spray can.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I take it from him and shake it.</p><p>He nods guiltily. \u201cI think just a little bit. I just hope you don\u2019t have an oh my God moment when you wake up tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay. This is the most fun I\u2019ve had in a very long time.\u201d Walking toward the rock, I consider what to write. I read along the vague words of wisdom others have written and the declarations of love.</p><p>\u201cJesus, it\u2019s high up here,\u201d Luke declares as he hoists himself over the edge. He gets to his feet and peers over the cliff, popping his knuckles. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of heights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d I tell him as Kayden ascends over the top, dragging himself up with his arms, and then he lies on his stomach. Panting, he rolls onto his back. \u201cYeah, I remember,\u201d he says, turning his head toward me and grinning.</p><p>I target the nozzle at a bare spot on the rock. As I press down on the top, I pretend I\u2019m an artist tracing the most beautiful painting, the lines blending together to put everything into meaning. When I\u2019m finished, I step back, breathing in the air, which is potent with paint fumes.</p><p>Kayden moves up next to me and drapes his arm around my shoulder. \u201cIn the existence of our lives, there is a single coincidence that brings us together and for a moment, our hearts beat as one.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>I hand him the paint can and his fingers graze my knuckles. \u201cI actually wrote that a while ago.\u201d I lower my voice and lean in. \u201cRight after that night at the pool house.\u201d</p><p>His expression plummets as his hand drops from my shoulder. He tosses Luke the can. \u201cWe should get going or the cab driver will leave our sorry asses and there\u2019s no way I\u2019m walking back.\u201d</p><p>My mood sinks as I realize that what I said upset him. As I watch him climb down, I feel my happy night drift away to the sky and the lightning.</p><p>When we return back to the dorms, Kayden leaves without saying good-bye. It hurts inside and confuses me to no end.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between you two?\u201d Seth asks as I swipe my card and open the door to my residence hall.</p><p>I shrug as I step inside. \u201cI think it\u2019s because I brought up the pool house. I don\u2019t even know why I did it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes look red under the lights as we make our way up the hallway toward the elevators located next to the lounging area. \u201cIt\u2019s because you aren\u2019t thinking very clearly tonight.\u201d</p><p>I swerve us to the right as two bulky guys, wearing football jerseys, walk down the hall toward us. \u201cI know. Being drunk is weird.\u201d</p><p>He covers his hand over his mouth to stifle his laughter. \u201cOh my God. I love you so much. Especially when you say stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, still smiling as we enter the elevator. \u201cNothing. Never mind. Although I'm dying to know why your shoe is green.\u201d</p><p>I crane my neck to look over my shoulder at the heel of my sneaker as he pushes the button to my floor. \u201cI stepped on a spray can while Kayden and I were fighting over one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have loved to see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you would have.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors open and we turn down the hall, stopping at the very end in front of my door. There is some giggling and thumping on the other side and the air smells like smoke.</p><p>Seth unties a red scarf from the doorknob and holds it up in front of my face. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I can\u2019t go inside.\u201d I take the scarf from him, dangle it over the knob, and sigh tiredly \u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she having sex or something?\u201d</p><p>My skin warms. \u201cI don\u2019t know... maybe.\u201d</p><p>His fingers wrap around the top of my arm and he hauls me toward the elevators. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go get you to bed.\u201d</p><p>I hurry to keep up with him. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bed.\u201d</p><p>When we reach the bottom floor, he steers us away from the noisy lounge, heading outside and around the corner toward his building. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sleep in my room. My roommate is never there anyway, so I\u2019ll take his bed and you can sleep in mine.\u201d</p><p>I want to hug him, but I\u2019m afraid if I let go of him, I\u2019ll fall over from the sleepiness taking over my body. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>When we get to his room, he punches the code to unlock the door and pulls me inside as he flips on the light. His roommate\u2019s bed is empty and piled with dirty laundry. Seth\u2019s side is orderly, expect for a row of empty energy drinks on top of his computer desk\u2014Seth is addicted to energy drinks.</p><p>\u201cHe never sleeps here?\u201d I ask, kicking an empty soda can out of the way.</p><p>He shakes his head, shucking off his jacket. \u201cI think he\u2019s afraid of me.\u201d</p><p>I pout my lip as I tuck my hands up into the sleeves of Kayden\u2019s shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. For what it\u2019s worth, he\u2019s a moron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry, baby girl.\u201d He empties his change and wallet out of his pockets and drops them on top of the dresser beside a lamp. \u201cYou\u2019re the most understanding person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>He starts to unbutton his shirt and I enfold my arms around him. \u201cYou\u2019re the greatest person ever.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he pats my head. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll see if you still think that when you have your very first hangover in the morning.\u201d</p><p>I gladly collapse onto his bed. Fluffing the pillow, I turn to my side, and stare at a picture of him and a guy with dark hair and bright blue eyes. \u201cSeth, is this him? In this picture.\u201d</p><p>It takes him a minute to respond. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s him. That\u2019s Braiden.\u201d</p><p>Braiden looks like a football player; strong shoulders, a lean chest, and well-defined arms. He has his arm wrapped around Seth\u2019s shoulder. They look happy, but deep down one of them isn\u2019t. One of them will out the other one when accusations of their love start to swarm around the school like a cluster of bees. One of them will watch as the other one is beaten. I want to ask him why he kept the photo\u2014why he has it on the wall\u2014but I can tell he\u2019s growing uneasy with the subject. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shuts the light off and from across the room, the bed squeaks as Seth lies down.

Every time I shut my eyes, all I see is the hate on their faces and fists and feet coming at me.\u201d</p><p>I swallow hard. \u201cSometimes, I swear, I can still smell him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can still smell the dirt and taste the blood,\u201d he whispers. \u201cAnd feel the pain.\u201d</p><p>He grows silent and the need to comfort him overtakes me. I roll to my side, climb off the bed, and sink down on the mattress beside him. He turns toward me; his face just an outline in the moonlight.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we won\u2019t have nightmares tonight,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe things will be different.\u201d</p><p>He sighs. \u201cI sure hope so, Callie. I really do.\u201d</p><p>For a minute I have hope. The night has been great and I feel like anything is possible, but then I close my eyes and it\u2019s all stolen away from me.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>#8 Challenge Yourself</p><p>Kayden</p> <p>After we leave the rock, I go back to my dorm, wanting to run away from everything I\u2019m feeling. The bathroom is occupied, so I end up going to bed, staring up at the ceiling while rain splashes against the window. From across the room, Luke is lying face down on the bed, snoring.</p><p>As the alcohol lifts from my system, every emotion rushes through me like a stream full of needles. I have to turn it off. It is the only way I know how to deal with life.</p><p>I roll to my side, raise my fist, and ram it into the headboard as hard as I can. My knuckles crack and Luke jumps up from his bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d He blinks around the room as silver lights flash from the lightning outside.</p><p>\u201cIt was the thunder,\u201d I lie and turn over, shutting my eyes and holding my hand against my chest as the burning pain explodes up my arm. Moments later, I fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sit down here all night by yourself,\u201d Luke says, walking across the room to the mini fridge in the corner. He takes out a beer and pops off the tab. \u201cYou\u2019ve been acting weird since the graduation ceremony.\u201d</p><p>I lie down on the couch, flexing my hand over and over again, staring at the veins flowing through it. \u201cI\u2019m just feeling a little bad about leaving.\u201d Honestly, I\u2019m just feeling weird about life. I want to leave, go away to college, be free, but the idea of being out in the open, surrounded by things I don\u2019t understand is fucking terrifying.</p><p>\u201cYou should go get yourself fucking laid, but by someone other than Daisy.\u201d He opens the door and the music from upstairs flows into the room. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d He shuts the door and leaves me alone, trapped in my own thoughts.</p> <p>He\u2019s right. I should just go upstairs and screw the first girl I come across. It\u2019s the best way to pass time and get through life, but I can\u2019t stop thinking about my hand and my fucking future.</p><p>Finally I get up from the couch. Walking toward the wall, I glance at the door. Then I lift my fist and hammer it into the wall as hard as I can. The sheetrock and paint crumble and my skin separates a little, but that isn\u2019t enough. I punch it again and again, forming holes in the wall, but causing very little damage to my hand. I need something harder\u2014I need brick.</p><p>I turn toward the door, but it swings open and my dad walks in. He takes a look at the holes in the wall and then at my hand cut up and bleeding all over the carpet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d He shakes his head as he stalks toward me, staring at the sheetrock and paint on the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d I cradle my hand to my chest as I hurry around him and rush outside.</p><p>Inside the house, people are laughing, screaming, singing to the music and the lights gleam through the darkness. I walk around to the back yard, hearing him at my heels, knowing he\u2019s going to catch up with me and he\u2019s madder than hell.</p><p>\u201cKayden Owens,\u201d he says as he darts in front of me, panting and his eyes are full of anger. His breath smells like whiskey and the wind is blowing leaves everywhere. \u201cWere you trying to mess up your hand on purpose?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t speak as I make a detour toward the pool house, unsure where I\u2019m going but feeling like I have to move.</p><p>When I reach the door, he snags my elbow and forces me to turn around. \u201cStart explaining. Now.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him blankly and he starts yelling at me, telling me what a fuck up I am, but I barely hear him. I watch his lips move, waiting for it. Seconds later, his fist collides with my face, but I hardly feel it. He does it over and over again as his eyes drift into a state of blankness. I fall to the ground and he kicks me as hard as he can, wanting me to get up. I don\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure I want to. Maybe it\u2019s time for it to be over; there isn\u2019t that much to be over anyway.</p><p>I listen to my heart beat calmly inside my chest, questioning why it doesn\u2019t react. It never does. I wonder if it\u2019s dead. Maybe it is. Maybe I am.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, a girl suddenly shows up behind my father. She\u2019s small and looks terrified, like I should be. She says something to my dad and when he looks at her, I think she\u2019s going to run away. But she stays with me until my dad leaves.</p><p>I sit on the ground confused and at a loss for words, because that\u2019s not how things go. People are supposed to walk away, pretend this doesn\u2019t exist, let the strange excuses make sense.</p><p>Her name is Callie and I know her from school. She\u2019s standing above me and looking at me with horror in her eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s the first time anyone\u2019s asked me that and it throws me off. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say more sharply than I\u2019d planned.</p><p>She turns to leave, but I don\u2019t want her to leave. I want her to come back and explain to me why she did it. So I ask her and she tries to tell me but it doesn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Finally, I give up on trying to understand and ask her to get a first aid kit and an icepack. I go into the pool house and take my shirt off, trying to clean up the blood on my face, but I look like shit. He hit me in the face, something he rarely does only when he\u2019s really pissed.</p><p>When Callie comes back, she seems nervous. We barely speak to each other, but then I have to ask her for help to get the kit open because my hand won\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cYou really need stitches,\u201d she tells me. \u201cOr you\u2019re going to have a scar.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh. Stitches aren\u2019t going to help. They fix skin, cuts, wounds, heal stuff on the outside. Everything broken with me is on the inside. \u201cI can handle scars, especially one\u2019s on the outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really think you should have your mom take you to the doctor and then you can tell her what happen,\u201d she says refusing to give up.</p><p>I start to unwind a small section of gauze, but using only one hand, I drop it like a dumbass. \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen and even if it did, it wouldn\u2019t matter. None of this does.\u201d</p><p>She picks it up and I expect her to hand it back to me, but she unravels the gauze around her hand. She puts the gauze over my wounds, eyeing my scars, noting them and the wrongness they carry. There\u2019s something in her eyes that looks very familiar, like she has something trapped in her. I wonder if it\u2019s what I look like.</p><p>My heart begins to beat loudly inside my chest for the first time in as long as I can remember. It starts off as subtle, but the longer her fingers are near my skin, the more deafening it gets until I can\u2019t hear anything anymore. I try not to panic. What the fuck is wrong with my heart?</p><p>She steps back with her head tucked down, like she wants to hide. I can barely see her face with my swollen eye and I want to see her face. I almost reach out and touch her, but then she\u2019s leaving, double-checking to make sure I\u2019m okay. I pretend not to care, but my heart keeps hammering inside my chest, louder and louder and louder.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I start to tell her. For everything, for not letting him beat me, for stepping in.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>I just can\u2019t get there. Because I\u2019m still not sure if I\u2019m thankful. \u201cFor getting me the first aid kit and icepack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Then she walks out the door and the god damn silence is back again.</p><p>My hand has to be taped up for the next week and I got my ass chewed off by my coach because it\u2019s fucking up the way I play. Things aren\u2019t going as well as I planned. I thought now that I was finally away from home, I\u2019d get over the darkness that possesses me, but I was wrong.</p><p>It\u2019s been over a week since Callie painted those beautiful words up on the rock. They meant more to me than she probably understood. Or maybe she did know, which is why I needed to pull back. That kind of emotion I can\u2019t deal with.</p><p>Near the end of the week, I\u2019m feeling really down and my body is paying for it. I\u2019m lying in my bed, getting ready to go to class, when Daisy sends me a very vague text.</p><p>Daisy: Hey, I think we should see other people.</p><p>Me. What? Are you drunk or something?</p><p>Daisy: Nope. I\u2019m completely sober. I\u2019m just bored and sick of being by myself all the time. I need more.</p><p>Me: I can\u2019t give you more when I\u2019m in college.</p><p>Daisy: Then guess u don\u2019t luv me as much as I thought.</p><p>Me: What do u want me to do? Drop out?</p><p>Daisy: I don\u2019t know what I want, but it\u2019s not this.</p><p>At the very same time I get another text and I switch screens.</p><p>Luke: I just got a text from D Man and he said he thinks Daisy cheated on you with Lenny.</p><p>Me: Are you fucking serious? Lenny?</p><p>Luke: Yeah, he said it happened during Gary\u2019s banging out the new school year party or whatever the fuck he calls it.</p><p>Me: The banging out party took place before she came to visit.</p><p>Luke: Yeah... I know. Sorry man.</p><p>Me: Yeah, later.</p><p>I turn off my phone, not bothering to text Daisy back. I don\u2019t really feel upset about it, but it feels like I should. It seems like I should be pissed off, but I feel empty.</p><p>During my Public Speaking class, I\u2019m listening to a girl give a speech on Women\u2019s Rights. I take some notes, but mainly stare out the window. I\u2019m eyeing the football stadium in the distance, wishing I could be out running laps and releasing all this pent up energy.</p><p>Suddenly, I see Callie walking across the lawn with a bag on her shoulder. She\u2019s on her phone, her hair is down, and her legs move rapidly to take her wherever she\u2019s going. She\u2019s wearing black yoga pants and a hoodie. She crosses the parking lot and yells something out when Luke appears on the sidewalk, heading for her. He\u2019s limping and glancing around like he\u2019s doing something wrong.</p><p>They meet up under a large oak tree where leaves are piled. Callie says something and then hands Luke her phone. She pulls pieces of her hair out of her mouth as Luke punches some buttons on her phone. She laughs as he says something and it leaves me scratching my head. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he hands her the phone back, they give a parting wave to each other and walk off in opposite directions. Callie disappears between a row of cars in the parking lot and Luke limps off toward the back area of the school. He never mentioned that he was hanging out with her. Why is he hanging out with her? Why is this fucking bothering me?</p><p>Reaching into my pocket, I slip my phone out and turn it back on.</p><p>Me: Why were you just talking to Callie?</p><p>Luke: Where the hell r u? I was fucking texting u and then suddenly ur phone was off.</p> <p>Me: In class... I saw u out the window.</p><p>Luke: Ok... Why does it matter what we were doing?</p><p>Me: It doesn\u2019t. I was just wondering.</p><p>Luke: We were just talking. Gotta go. Class is starting.</p><p>It drives me crazy, which makes no sense. I should be more upset about my girlfriend of three years dumping me, but it\u2019s a glitch compared to the idea that Callie and Luke could be going out or something.</p> <p>Finally I shove up from the desk, making a scene as I storm out of class right in the middle of the poor girl\u2019s speech. Bursting out the doors, the sunlight blinds me as I stomp toward the benches in the quad. Slumping down onto one, I lower my head into my hands and take a deep breath. I can\u2019t react this way about anyone. Ever. It\u2019s a rule of mine. Never drag anyone into my own shit. Callie is the last person who needs it on her shoulders.</p><p>The longer I sit there, the more worked up I get, and I realize the only way to sort stuff out is to actually figure out what\u2019s going on. I text Luke and ask him if I can borrow his truck. He says yes, but to be back by two because he needs to go somewhere, and he lets me know that the keys are on the dresser.</p><p>I drive off toward The Tune Up Gym, where Callie said she kick boxes. She was dressed like she was going to work out so I assume that\u2019s where she\u2019s heading, however, when I arrive I can\u2019t determine if I want to be right or wrong about my assumption.</p><p>I climb out of the truck and stare at the small brick building. \u201cWhat the hell am I doing here?\u201d I mutter to myself, turning back to the truck. That\u2019s when Seth hops out of the car a few rows down.</p><p>He waves at me with a cigarette in his hand and a puzzled look on his face. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>I wind around the front of the truck toward him. \u201cAre you working out?\u201d</p> <p>He glances down at his jeans and button-down shirt. \u201cNah, I just come with Callie to keep her company.\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling like a fucking idiot for coming down here. Since when do I chase down girls? \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>He flicks his cigarette to the asphalt and stomps on it with the tip of his boot. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d He eyes my dark jeans and plaid shirt.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI have no idea. I really don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He points a finger at the glass doors of the gym. \u201cCallie\u2019s inside. I\u2019m sure she\u2019d love to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>I pop my knuckles, even the ones that are taped up. It hurts, but it calms me down. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll walk in with you for a second.\u201d</p><p>He grins and we weave around the cars toward the entrance of the building. There\u2019s a big guy walking in with a bag over his shoulder and Seth moves up to hold the door open for him.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask what happened?\u201d He nods his head at my hand as we step inside.</p> <p>I lift my taped hand up in front of me. \u201cI hurt it during practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d He leads the way around the treadmills to the back area where mats are set up. The room stinks of salt and heat and is filled with clanking noises from the weight machines. There\u2019s upbeat music blasting through the speakers to pump everyone up.</p><p>Callie is near the back of the mats, kicking at a bag the dangles from the ceiling. I don\u2019t like how happy I am to see her, or how happy my body is to see her. Emotions and want rip through me like a fucking wave.</p><p>She\u2019s bouncing around on her toes with her jacket off. She has a tank top on and her hair is pulled back. It\u2019s the most skin I\u2019ve seen her show and I enjoy the view; the freckles on her shoulders, the arch of her neck, her collarbone. The tight pants she has on give me a great view of her ass and her legs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt her,\u201d Seth says, leaning in my face. \u201cI fucking mean that.\u201d</p><p>I blink at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He backs toward Callie. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt her,\u201d he repeats, and then spins on his heels, putting his back to me. He whisks up to Callie, and says something to her.</p><p>Emotions flood her face as her gaze darts to me. She timidly waves her hand and I walk over to her with my hands tucked in the pockets of my jeans.</p><p>Her white bra is showing through her shirt and she crosses her arms over her chest. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asks, tracing the toe of her shoe back and forth across the mat.</p><p>\u201cI was just driving by and saw Seth\u2019s car out front,\u201d I lie. \u201cSo I thought I\u2019d stop in and say hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d She presses her lips together.</p><p>I shake my head and chuckle under my breath. Circling around the punching bag, I give it a little shove, and then dodge to the side when it flings back at me. \u201cYou really weren\u2019t kidding about the kick boxing thing.\u201d</p><p>She tightens the elastic around her ponytail. \u201cDid you think I was saying it to try and impress you?\u201d She flutters her eyelashes as she steps to the side. I question if she did it on purpose, to try and flirt with me. I doubt it. I\u2019d be surprised if she knew how to flirt.</p><p>\u201cWell, I was hoping you were.\u201d I punch the bag with my good hand.</p><p>Her gaze flickers to Seth who\u2019s messing around with small dumbbells, shaking his hips as he sings to the song on the radio. \u201cNope, this is what I do for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you any good?\u201d I eye her tiny frame with doubt.</p><p>Pieces of her damp hair frame her face as she places her hands on her hips, trying to look tough, but all I\u2019m focused on is her bra showing through her shirt. \u201cYou want to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, big words for a little girl.\u201d I\u2019m flirting with her and I know it\u2019s wrong for so many reasons, but it\u2019s the most alive I\u2019ve felt in a long time. I pick up one of the gloves from the corner of the mat and put it on before positioning my hand out to the side. \u201cGive it your best shot.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows dip together. \u201cYou want me to kick you? Really? What if I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI absolutely want you to kick me,\u201d I say and then trying to get her riled up, add, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes turn cold, her expression serious as her fists rise in front of her. She angles her body sideways, stepping back on her foot. She\u2019s got pretty good form, but she\u2019s so little that I know it won\u2019t hurt.</p><p>She pivots her hips, springing up on her toes, and the bottom of her sneaker collides against the glove. My arm shoots back and my foot slides along the mat. Fuck. It stings. A lot.</p><p>She grins as she returns her foot to the mat. \u201cDid it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I admit, shaking my hand. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re as sweet as can be, but give you permission to kick me, and holy hell, you\u2019re ruthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The laughter in her voice says otherwise. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to kick you so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you did.\u201d I pick up another glove and wiggle my fingers into it. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s see what else you got.\u201d</p><p>She gapes at me with her hands out to her side. \u201cAre you joking? You want me to fight you.\u201d</p><p>I punch one glove into the other. \u201cI won\u2019t fight back, but I\u2019ll try to stay out of your wrath.\u201d</p><p>She laughs and it makes my heart jump alive inside my chest. \u201cAlright, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>I grin at her as I move forward. \u201cGive it your best shot.\u201d</p><p>She attempts to look dangerous, her lips a straight line, her eyes unblinking, but it\u2019s more entertaining than anything. She steps to the side, and I think she\u2019s going to pop her foot up and kick, but she keeps overlapping her feet as she circles me. I turn with her, curious what she\u2019s doing and then out of nowhere, she springs up and slams her foot into my hand. I barely block it and she lowers her foot, giving me hardly any time as she twirls around on her toe and jabs her shoe into my other glove.</p><p>She stations her foot onto the ground with a cocky look on her face. \u201cHad enough yet?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as I reposition my feet. \u201cOkay, if you want to play dirty, then let\u2019s play dirty.\u201d</p><p>She bounces up on her toes, getting ready to jump up and kick me. Before she finishes it, I dash forward, wrap my arms around her waist and flip her around, pressing her back against my chest.</p><p>I freeze, wondering if she\u2019s going to panic, but she swings her arm up toward me as she tries to squat down and slip out of my arms. I strengthen my hold on her and pin her against my chest.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d I tease her as she tries to kick me in the shin and I jump back, keeping my grip on her. \u201cYou acted all tough when you were the one having all the fun.\u201d</p><p>Her body suddenly stills. Then she reaches up, grabs my arms and with no warning, flings them off her. Trying to keep a hold of her, because I was enjoying the feel of her warmth against me, I seize the bottom of her shirt. She stumbles back into me and our legs entangle together. Spinning around, we trip over each other\u2019s feet and tumble to the mat on our sides. She quickly hitches her leg over my midsection and mounts on top of me, pinning my arms down with her small hands.</p><p>Her ponytail has partially fallen out and her hair touches my cheeks as she hovers over me. Her chest heaves up and down, her skin damp, and her eyes stern.</p><p>\u201cI win,\u201d she says, shifting her weight.</p><p>The feel of her on top of me, the way she smells, the way her legs are spread around my hips is intoxicating. I\u2019m starting to get turned on and she\u2019s going to feel it pressed up against her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re vicious when you fight,\u201d I state. \u201cI really didn\u2019t think you had it in you.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead creases. \u201cMe either.\u201d</p><p>I let a few more seconds pass, even though I should be moving out from under her. My gaze zones in on her lips and I almost glide my hand up her back, tangle it through her hair, and pull her down for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cOkay, as much as I hate to interrupt this beautiful moment here,\u201d Seth says as his face appears over us. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to. Miss Callie here has somewhere to be.\u201d</p><p>She blinks, her cheeks turning pink, like she\u2019s coming out of a daze, and she swiftly hops off me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I got a little carried away.\u201d</p><p>I prop up on my elbows. \u201cWhere are you heading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm....\u201d She slips the elastic out from her hair and refastens it into a tight ponytail. \u201cI\u2019m meeting Luke somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuke, as in, Luke?\u201d</p><p>She nods, glancing at Seth. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>I push up from the ground and wiggle my hands out of the gloves. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She runs her arm across her forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you why.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I toss the gloves onto the ground near the corner, irritated. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you,\u201d she hurries and adds, \u201cbut I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have to head out anyway. I have some stuff I need to do.\u201d I walk away from her, knowing it\u2019s for the best, but wishing I was the one she was going to see.</p><p>Chapter 7</p> <p>#27 Offer to Help Someone Without Them Asking.</p><p>Callie</p><p>I feel weird going with Luke, for various reasons, one being that I barely know him. I have no idea how I got into the situation. Actually I do. I was walking around the back end of the campus, because I like how quiet it is there.</p><p>As I was pouring some M&amp;Ms into my mouth, I rounded the corner and nearly stepped on Luke. He was sitting down on the ground, in the dirt, with his head lowered and his legs bent up in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I jumped back, pressing my hand to my heart. \u201cWhat are you doing back here?\u201d</p> <p>He had on shorts and a white t-shirt and his brown hair was damp. He lifted his face up and his skin was paler than snow. \u201cCallie, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I balled up the candy wrapper in my hand. \u201cI walk this way after my English class is over. I was actually getting ready to meet up with Seth to go to the gym.\u201d</p><p>He bobbed his head up and down and sweat was beading his forehead. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I turned to leave, but decided I couldn\u2019t leave him looking so terrible. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>He scratched at his arm. \u201cYeah, I was working out and started feeling like shit so I came back here to take a breather for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I crouched down in front of him, keeping enough distance to make me comfortable. \u201cAre you sick or something? You look...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike shit,\u201d he finished for me as he got to his feet and sighed.</p><p>My gaze snapped down to his leg, swollen twice its size, blotchy and red. \u201cWhat happened to your leg?\u201d</p><p>He released a slow exhale as he inclined against the brick wall of the school. \u201cI may or may not have forgotten to take my insulin for the last few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a diabetic?\u201d</p><p>He put a finger to his lips and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone. I don\u2019t like to show weakness. It\u2019s a weird thing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been taking your shots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ran out and never picked up more. It\u2019s another weird thing with me... I sometimes can\u2019t bring myself to stab a needle into my body.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t press as I eyed his leg, enflamed from the knee down. \u201cDo you need me to take you to the doctor? Or go find Kayden?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, stepping forward and then stumbled back, banging his elbow into the wall. \u201cDon\u2019t tell Kayden. When I say no one knows, I mean no one knows.\u201d</p><p>I adjusted the strap of my bag higher up on my shoulder. \u201cI think you need to go to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I need to go to the doctor.\u201d Putting some weight on his leg, he hobbled toward me. \u201cLook, don\u2019t you have stuff you don\u2019t want people to know?\u201d</p><p>I nodded warily. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well for me, this is one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cSo can you keep quiet about it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded again. \u201cAs long as you let me take you to the doctor.\u201d</p><p>He shut his eyes, breathed in through his nose, and his chest expanded out from underneath his shirt as he opened his eyelids. \u201cOkay, we have a deal. Let me go change my clothes, make an appointment, and then I\u2019ll meet you out front in like twenty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should just go to the ER,\u201d I suggested. \u201cYou look terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cER trips cost a lot of money,\u201d he replied, limping toward the metal doors. \u201cMoney I don\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll meet you out front,\u201d I told him and then he stepped inside, letting the door slam shut behind him.</p><p>As I headed for my dorm to drop my stuff off, I had no idea how I\u2019d gotten myself into the situation. I\u2019d spent the last six years trying to stay away from guys, but it seems like that\u2019s all I've been around lately, but I wasn\u2019t going to bail out on him.</p><p>When I met him out front twenty minutes later, it turned out he couldn\u2019t get into the doctor for another two hours, so we exchanged numbers and I promised him I\u2019d be back from the gym in time to take him.</p><p>Two hours later, we\u2019re sitting in the office. Luke jiggles his knee up and down as I read through a copy of People magazine while finishing off a piece of licorice. I changed out of my workout clothes into jeans and a t-shirt. I\u2019m surprised how well I\u2019m handling what I did at the gym with Kayden. Sitting on top of him like that was strange, but my body liked it. A lot. Seth teased me about it the entire drive home and I kept waiting for it to crash into me, yet I still feel fine.</p><p>Luke\u2019s skin looks almost yellow beneath the lighting of the waiting room. I flip the page and then tilt my head to the side to try and make out what I\u2019m looking at.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you hate doctor\u2019s offices?\u201d Luke says abruptly.</p><p>I glance up and his brown eyes are huge as he stares at a man across from us, hacking into his hand. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>He scratches agitatedly at his temple until there are red streaks on his skin. \u201cIt\u2019s so fucking unsanitary.\u201d</p><p>I close the magazine and drop it on the table. \u201cMaybe if you didn\u2019t think about it so much, then you\u2019d relax a little.\u201d</p><p>He pauses and his foot quits tapping. \u201cI just really hate needles.\u201d</p><p>It makes no sense, since he\u2019s probably had to take insulin shots for a while. The fear in his eyes makes me wonder if there\u2019s more to his phobia than just the needles, though.</p><p>\u201cOkay, think of something else.\u201d I scoop up a copy of Sports Illustrated from off the table beside me. \u201cRead this. It\u2019ll help take your mind off stuff.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows furrow as he takes the magazine from me and studies the girl on the cover. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t remember you being this way in high school. You were really quiet and everyone...\u201d He trails off, but I know what he was going to say; that everyone made fun of me, picked on me, teased and tortured me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t bring that stuff up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I assure him, but memories explode through my brain like shards of glass.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you remind me of my sister, Amy,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you remember her. She was a couple of years older than us.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>He opens the magazine and flips the page. \u201cShe was a lot like you. Quiet, nice, but sad.\u201d</p><p>I notice he said was. I press my lips together as the glass in my head multiplies as it shatters into more pieces. \u201cWill you excuse me for a second?\u201d</p><p>I get up from my chair and scurry down the hall to the bathroom. My shoulders start to hunch over as the ache in my stomach builds. Thankfully, the bathroom is empty, otherwise I would have done it in the hall and everyone would have known my little secret. The one thing that makes me feel better during the darkest times of my thoughts. The one thing that belongs to me and no one can take it away.</p><p>\u201cI think I should take you there as a thank you,\u201d Luke says as we drive by a carnival set up in the fairgrounds. The sun is descending behind the mountains and the sky is grey with splashes of pink and orange. Neon lights and music take over the land.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been to one since I was like eleven,\u201d I admit. \u201cI was never really into the rides, especially the ones that went high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ever go to our town fair?\u201d he asks, pausing at a stoplight.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI stopped going when I turned twelve.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me, waiting for an explanation, but what would I say? That my childhood kind of ended at twelve when my innocence was stolen? That after it happened, cotton candy, balloons, games, and rides made me wish for a time I\u2019d never have again?</p><p>\u201cWell, then I\u2019m taking you,\u201d he says as the light changes and a green glow reflects across his face. He releases the clutch and the truck rolls forward.</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI was happy to help you, especially since you no longer look like you\u2019re going to drop dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I look that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou looked like shit.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head with a small smile on his face. \u201cStill, I think we should go hang out. It\u2019s better than going back to the campus and sitting in the dorms. I\u2019ve barely gotten out of my room since school started.\u201d He pauses as he spins the wheel and makes a right into the dirt parking lot at the side of the white tents and the neon glow of the rides. \u201cYou can call Seth and invite him.\u201d He considers something as he shuts off the engine. \u201cI\u2019ll call Kayden and see if he wants to come.\u201d</p><p>I pick at my fingernails as I try to stay calm and not get all giddy like a silly girl. \u201cI guess we could do that.\u201d</p><p>I pull my cell phone out of the pocket of my jeans while he grabs his off the cracked dashboard. While I call Seth, he talks to Kayden. I hear Luke being vague as to why we\u2019re together and I wonder if Kayden\u2019s still mad.</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2019s in.\u201d I raise my hips to shove my phone back into my pocket. \u201cAnd he said he was going to call Kayden to see if he wants a ride... if he\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>Luke repeats what I say to Kayden, and then he snaps his phone shut, rubbing the back of his upper arm where he got the insulin shot. \u201cKayden says he\u2019s in, too.\u201d He opens the door and hops out, slanting back into the cab to snatch the keys from the ignition. \u201cI told him we\u2019d meet him over by the Zipper.\u201d</p><p>I climb out, push the door shut with my hip, and meet him around at the other side of the truck. I take in all the crazy, spinning rides. \u201cThe Zipper? That one sounds interesting.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles as we hike across the parking lot toward the gated entrance. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll see if you\u2019re still saying that when you see it.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019re waiting in line for a ride that has a long metal center with cages attached to it. Each cage flips around as the middle section whips in a circular motion, so there is double the spin. The lights twinkle and some heavy rock music plays so loudly I can barely hear the screams from inside the cages. I watch it spin around and around, psyching myself out while Luke texts on his phone.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to make it?\u201d Kayden\u2019s breath caresses my neck as his voice touches my eardrum.</p><p>I turn my head and his lips nearly touch mine. The abrupt closeness throws him off as much as it does me and we both take a step back at the same time.</p><p>He\u2019s wearing a loose fitted pair of jeans, boots, and a long sleeve black shirt. His dark hair looks a little wet, like he just got out of the shower before he came here.</p><p>He\u2019s gorgeous, I admit to myself. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been able to admit that about a guy in a very long time.</p><p>\u201cYou look freaked out,\u201d he shouts over the music as he leans closer. \u201cAre you seriously considering riding that thing?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe...\u201d I slant my neck back, tipping my head up at the ride. \u201cBut it goes so high up.\u201d</p><p>Pink and yellow lights dance across his face as he glances at the ride and then looks me in the eyes. \u201cHow about we share a cage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea,\u201d I say. \u201cIn fact, I think it\u2019s a very bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d The corners of his lips quirk as his gaze darkens. \u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I trust you,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to end up throwing up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he assures me, nudging his shoulder into mine and then he winks at me. There\u2019s something different about him tonight; he\u2019s freer and I think he might be flirting with me. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t let anything happen to you. In fact, you can hold my hand the entire time.\u201d</p><p>Where was he during my twelfth birthday? Probably playing hide-and-seek with the rest of the kids.</p><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll ride with you,\u201d I say with hesitance. \u201cBut don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarning taken and rejected.\u201d He interlocks his fingers through mine as he jerks me forward with the moving line.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sitting this one out,\u201d Luke calls out as he drifts over to the bench with his attention on his phone. \u201cI got some stuff I got to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Seth?\u201d I ask, glancing around at the booths, the games, and the trailers with food, trying not to make a big deal that Kayden\u2019s holding my hand.</p><p>But it\u2019s all I notice.</p><p>\u201cHe went to meet up with someone.\u201d Kayden steps forward and I move my feet with him. \u201cHe said to tell you that he would catch up with us in a little bit and to relax and have fun.\u201d</p><p>I scrunch my nose at the ride. \u201cAnd this qualifies as fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d He tugs me toward the guy running the ride, who\u2019s dressed in a blue polo shirt, old jeans, and a trucker\u2019s hat. \u201cYou\u2019ll have a blast.\u201d</p> <p>I show the guy the stamp on my hand and then Kayden puts his arm in front of me to show him the stamp on his. As he pulls back, his hand unintentionally grazes my boob and I blink at the tingling sensation it elicits.</p><p>The ticket guy unlocks the gate for us and we walk up the ramp. Kayden lets go of my hand so I can hop into the cage. Once I\u2019m in the seat with my feet planted firmly on the bottom, he joins me. Without any preparation, the ticket guy slams the door shut and locks the cage from the outside. There are padded bars on the inside that push against my shoulders and secure me back into the seat. It\u2019s a tight fit and Kayden\u2019s leg is pressed against mine; scorching hot through my clothes.</p><p>He angles forward, meeting my eyes and a slow smile spreads across his face. \u201cIt\u2019s snug in here.\u201d</p><p>I nod my head and it bumps against the back of the seat. \u201cToo snug. If it flings off the hinges, it\u2019ll be crushed into a ball when it hits the ground and smash us right along with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop psyching yourself out,\u201d he says in a carefree tone, then jerks his shoulders forward and rocks the cage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I beg, my fingers tightening around the bars. \u201cPretty please. Can\u2019t we just stay stationary?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head as the ride progresses forward and halts so the cage in front of us lines up with the ramp. \u201cNow what would be the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be fun because I would be able to hold in all that candy corn I ate,\u201d I say innocently.</p> <p>He stops rocking the cage. \u201cOh, come on, Callie. It won\u2019t be fun if we don\u2019t rock it. In fact, the more we rock it, the better it\u2019ll feel.\u201d His voice drops to a deep whisper. \u201cWe can rock it nice and slow or really, really fast.\u201d</p><p>His words make my cheeks flush, but luckily it\u2019s dark. \u201cAnd what if I get scared? Or my gag reflex gets a little too excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what.\u201d He maneuvers his hand around the bar and squeezes my knee with his fingers, sending a shot of warmth between my legs. \u201cIf you feel like you\u2019re going to throw up and you get freaked out of your mind, yell, Kayden is the sexiest man alive and I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>The cage jerks backward and I grip the bars as we begin to ascend to the top. \u201cThat is seriously what you want me to yell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He pauses as our cage reaches the highest point and the ride comes to a standstill, swaying in the breeze. \u201cDo I have your permission to rock away and give you the ride of your life?\u201d</p><p>Why does it feel like he\u2019s secretly talking dirty to me? \u201cYeah, go ahead, rock it nice and hard,\u201d I say without thinking, then bite down on my lip as the dirty section of my brain catches up with me. Honestly, I didn\u2019t even know that side existed.</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d He releases a slow breath with wide eyes and then shakes his head. \u201cOkay, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>I intensify my grip around the bars and press the tips of my shoes to the floor. \u201cYep... I think.\u201d</p><p>He flings his body forward as the ride takes off. Our cage starts to spin gradually at first, but the more weight he puts into his rocks the faster it goes. The lights from outside flash all around and the music picks up. I hear the roar of other rides; people laughing, screaming. The wind blows against my cheeks and the air smells like salt and cotton candy.</p><p>The faster it goes, the more I lose sight of what\u2019s up and what\u2019s down as we go around and around. The hinges squeak and I hear Kayden laugh as I let out a little squeal. Surprisingly, I don\u2019t freak out, nor does Kayden get a lap full of candy corn. I\u2019m having fun, even though it feels like my face is being sucked back into my skull and my brain is rattling around.</p><p>When the ride stops, we\u2019re at the top and the breeze sneaks in between the holes in the door.</p><p>Kayden opens his eyes and a confused look rises on his face. \u201cI thought you passed out or something with how quiet you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just enjoying the ride,\u201d I say breathlessly. \u201cIt was actually pretty fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad I\u2019m that good,\u201d he says, resting back in the seat.</p><p>I turn my head away to hide the smile on my face, because he\u2019s just having fun and I\u2019m enjoying it way too much. He has a girlfriend. A very pretty girlfriend, who isn\u2019t up to her neck in problems. One that he can touch and rock away with or whatever.</p><p>We don\u2019t speak until our cage reaches the ramp. When the ticket guy opens the door, Kayden hops out and I follow, stumbling over my own feet as the world sways from my dizziness. My shoulder slams into his broad chest. He laughs at me as his fingers grip my waist and he guides me closer to his side. Between the rush of adrenaline and the feel of his hands holding me, it seems like it\u2019s going to be a good night.</p><p>And I\u2019ve been looking for one of those for a while.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>#17 Let Something Amazing Happen, Without Question or Hesitation</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I know what I\u2019m doing is wrong, but I can\u2019t seem to stop. I\u2019m flirting with her, looking for excuses to touch her and make her laugh. I\u2019ve never laid it on this thick before with anyone, including Daisy. Daisy was easy. All I had to do was say something nice about her and life was good. Not with Callie. With her I have to earn it.</p><p>\u201cNo one ever wins these games, especially the top shelf prizes,\u201d Seth declares as we roam along the row of booths. He\u2019s got his arm around Callie and they keep whispering to each other. I want to exchange places with him, but don\u2019t know the right way to go about it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a trick, I tell you, to steal all your money.\u201d He makes an evil villain mixed with a pirate laugh and Callie buries her face into his chest, her shoulders heaving as she laughs hysterically.</p><p>\u201cDid he seriously just say that?\u201d Luke asks as he maneuvers around an older man handing out flyers.</p><p>I nod, my gaze tracking the booths. \u201cI think he did.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s neck cranes to the left as he checks out a tall brunette, wearing tight jeans and a shirt that covers half her stomach. \u201cI think you might have to prove him wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to tell me that you can win that?\u201d Seth points at a booth where darts have to be thrown at balloons. Then, he aims his finger toward the ceiling where there are massive teddy bears hanging by strings. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not talking about those silly little prizes on the bottom row. I want one of those big ones up there.\u201d</p><p>I crack my knuckles and my neck. \u201cOkay, first off when I win one, it\u2019s not going to be for you. It\u2019s going to be for that beautiful girl right there.\u201d I point at Callie, then want to take it back, even though it\u2019s true.</p><p>Callie glances up at me through her eyelashes, trying to hold back a blush and Seth clears his throat. \u201cAlright, manly man,\u201d he says. \u201cGo prove that you\u2019re a man.\u201d</p><p>I slip my wallet out of my back pocket, while Luke ambles off toward the rides, lighting up a cigarette.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize he\u2019s the quarterback, right?\u201d Callie says to Seth as they walk behind me and it makes me smile for some stupid reason. \u201cHe practices hitting a target every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Seth argues. \u201cI\u2019m still calling his bull shit. These games are unwinnable.\u201d</p><p>Callie stands to the side of me as I hand the guy in the booth some money in exchange for five darts. He lays them down on the counter and backs into the corner, returning his attention to his dinner.</p><p>I pick one up, raise it over my shoulder, and squint at a balloon. Callie crosses her arms, studying me, and I lower the dart, but keep my eyes on the balloon. \u201cAre you trying to make me nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why? Am I?\u201d she asks uneasily.</p><p>\u201cKind of,\u201d I admit, looking at her. \u201cI can feel your intense gaze burning through the side of my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ll stop,\u201d she sputters and begins to turn away.</p><p>I catch the bottom of her white t-shirt and my knuckles graze her soft skin. \u201cNo, keep looking at me like that. It makes it more challenging.\u201d</p><p>She glances down at my hand and then her gaze glides up me. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I tear my eyes off her, lift the dart back up as she focuses on me, and fling it at a red balloon on the top row. It pops and Callie flinches. \u201cOne down, four to go.\u201d I grin at her, but note that she\u2019s growing nervous.</p><p>I pick up another dart and throw it, then repeat the same move. Each one pops a balloon and when I\u2019m done, the top row is nothing but deflated pieces of latex. The guy behind the counter comes over with a frown on his face.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he says in a monotone voice and points his finger at a row of teddy bears dangling from the ceiling. \u201cYou get your choose from one of those lovely prizes up there.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Callie who\u2019s staring at the balloons with a frown on her lips. \u201cI said if I won, it was for you.\u201d</p><p>Callie sighs, her shoulders slumping as she fixes her eyes up at the bears. \u201cThey seem so big. I think my roommate would be pissed if I brought it back to our tiny room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to take the prize,\u201d Seth says with a serious expression on his face as he puts his hands on the counter and tilts his head up to look at all the prizes. \u201cYou don\u2019t turn down a top shelf prize.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She dithers, twisting the end of her ponytail around her finger. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take the pink one with the torn ear.\u201d</p><p>The guy behind the counter scratches his neck. \u201cAre you being serious?\u201d</p><p>Her face is stoic. \u201cAbsolutely. I never kid about teddy bears.\u201d</p><p>Seth and I laugh at her and the guy pierces us with a look, before he marches over to the wall and grabs a metal pole. Pointing it up to the tent ceiling, he unhooks the bear Callie selected. Then he takes it off the end and tosses it on the counter before he stomps away, muttering, \u201cI need a fucking smoke break.\u201d</p> <p>Callie picks up the bear, which is half the size of her, and assesses it with distaste. \u201cI still don\u2019t think I should bring it back to the dorm.\u201d She glances up at me. \u201cMaybe you should take it with you. You did win it.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019m going to drag a giant, deformed, pink bear across campus and take it to my room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe we could give it to a little kid,\u201d she suggests, flicking her fingers at the bear\u2019s nose and making a face. \u201cThey\u2019d probably love to have it.\u201d</p><p>We peer around at the crowd and then Callie giggles as she stares at a booth that is set up with display cases that hold sunglasses. \u201cOr we could dress it up and put a Wanted: In need of a home sign in its hand and leave it somewhere for someone to pick up.\u201d</p><p>I poke my finger at the teddy bears eye and it falls out. \u201cI actually like that idea and the sunglasses can hide the fact that it just lost an eye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, can we buy it a tiara?\u201d Seth asks, glancing around excitedly. \u201cPlease let me put one on its head. It can cover up its missing ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you go get a tiara and I\u2019ll go get it some sunglasses.\u201d She lugs the bear up in her arms as Seth takes off toward a red and white tent that\u2019s set up at the end.</p><p>I fidget with the bear\u2019s good ear as Callie pushes her way through the crowd, practically using the bear as a shield. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad looking thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She stops at the sunglass booth and drops the bear to the ground. \u201cI like it. I just don\u2019t think my roommate would like it.\u201d She cocks her head at the bear. \u201cWhen I was younger, I would have kept it in a heartbeat. In fact, I had a whole collection of them.\u201d</p><p>I arch an eyebrow at her. \u201cYou collected broken, smelly carnival bears?\u201d</p><p>She laughs and I love that it was me that made her do it this time, not Seth. \u201cNo, but I had a collection of broken stuffed animals. Like a cat with no whiskers and a puppy with no nose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I joke. \u201cTorture them and tug off their limbs?\u201d</p><p>She places her palms on the table that holds a display case full of glasses. \u201cNo, I just never wanted to throw them away. Even if they were broken, I still loved them.\u201d She peers down into the case, completely oblivious to how much her words mean to me.</p><p>Slowly, I place my hand on the table and inch it toward hers, finally covering it with mine. Her chest rises and falls as she pretends that nothing\u2019s going on and I trace my finger along the folds of her hand, my eyelids starting to shut.</p><p>\u201cWhich ones were you looking at?\u201d An older woman with beads on her wrists and a long flowing skirt waltzes up to us.</p><p>I jerk my hand away and let it fall to my side as I lean over Callie\u2019s shoulder to look through the glass. \u201cWhich ones were you thinking?\u201d</p><p>She slants her head to the side and her hair touches my cheek. \u201cHow about the sparkly blue pair that are shaped like stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d I barely pay attention to what she\u2019s saying, because I\u2019m smelling her hair like a fucking weirdo.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with me? Strange feelings clench at my chest, ones I was taught to shut off. It\u2019s literally hurting me, like a knife to the chest, and all I want to do is fucking leave and go turn it off the only way I know how.</p> <p>\u201cAre we already moving on from the Wicked Witch of the West?\u201d Luke asks as I circle around the ticket booth, searching the grass for the glasses Callie accidentally dropped somewhere.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d I stand up straight. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it was something we were doing together and I\u2019m not trying to do anything with Callie. We\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>He flicks the button on his lighter with his thumb, ignoring my comment. \u201cYou know, if you want, I can get her in a situation with you where you\u2019ll have your chance to do whatever you want with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I just broke up with Daisy, right?\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cAnd you seem so sad about it.\u201d</p><p>I find the glasses near the trashcan and pick them up, plucking off the grass stuck in the cracks of the frames. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to do anything with Callie.\u201d</p><p>He pulls his unlit cigarette out of his mouth and stares at it. \u201cI can\u2019t remember where I left my pack.\u201d He pats his pockets and then turns in a circle, looking at the ground.</p><p>Luke has this thing with losing stuff, especially his cigarettes. Nicotine is his sedative and without it, he flips out. \u201cWhere the fuck did I...\u201d he trails off walking backwards toward a bench and sighs as he scoops up the pack. He tucks it into his pocket and shuts his eyes, like he thought he just lost an arm. \u201cWe could do a challenge.\u201d</p><p>I open and close the ends on the glasses. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done that since sophomore year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you started dating Daisy,\u201d he points out. \u201cMan, I miss those days.\u201d</p><p>I stare off at the rides whipping around in various directions. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think I can trick Callie into going under the bleachers with me. It\u2019d feel wrong.\u201d</p><p>Luke thrums his fingers on the side of his leg to the beat of the rock song playing nearby as his gaze roams to the jungle gym ride in the corner. It\u2019s dark inside and no one\u2019s standing at the gate. \u201cHang on. I got an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCare to share the details of your idea?\u201d I ask. \u201cI don\u2019t want to walk into this blind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink challenge to the max.\u201d He walks backwards across the dry grass toward the exit gates. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in five minutes. All you need to do is follow my lead and, as a thank you, you can let me drive that motorcycle you don\u2019t let anyone touch when we go home for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo fucking\u2014\u201d</p><p>He disappears out the gates, waving me off. Shaking my head, I return back to Callie and her bear, feeling guilty. But deep down, I know I\u2019m going to go through with Luke\u2019s plan, because I want to, more than anything at the moment.</p><p>Callie</p><p>As Seth puts the finishing touches on the bear, Luke comes strolling up with an unlit cigarette between his lips. He has a jacket on with the hood pulled over his head and the front pocket is bulky.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that thing?\u201d He squints down at the cardboard sign in the bear\u2019s hand. There\u2019s a glittery tiara on its head, sunglasses covering the eyes, and a string of beads around its neck. He reads the sign aloud, \u201cWill be ridiculously cute in exchange for a loving home, food, water, and a little cuddle time.\u201d He flicks the ear with his fingers. \u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d</p><p>I laugh, biting down on the top of the pen. \u201cWe made it so it would get adopted and so none of us has to take it home.\u201d</p><p>Luke glances at Kayden, who shrugs. \u201cI thought it was kind of funny. And be thankful. For a while, Callie was trying to get me to take it home.\u201d</p><p>Luke scrunches his forehead, takes the cigarette out of his mouth, and sticks it into the bear\u2019s mouth. \u201cThere, that\u2019s much better.\u201d</p><p>Kayden rolls his eyes at him and stuffs his hands into the pockets of his jeans. \u201cSo what\u2019s next on the list? And I\u2019m speaking figuratively, not about your actual list.\u201d</p><p>I look over my shoulder at the rides twirling, twisting, and sparkling against the night. \u201cWe could ride some more rides, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI actually have a better idea.\u201d Luke strolls off without finishing his thought and the three of us trade glances before hurrying after him. He marches toward a jungle gym made up of ropes, ramps, netting, and bars. There are three levels and a short gate borders the bottom. I think the point of the ride is to get to the top and then down to the bottom again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s open,\u201d I say as Luke reaches for the latch on the gate.</p><p>With his hand in his pocket, he checks over his shoulder and then nudges the gate open with his foot. \u201cOh look at that. It is now.\u201d He walks inside and signals us to follow. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s nothing but a giant playground. Besides, we\u2019re celebrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCelebrating what?\u201d Seth and I ask at the same time.</p><p>He grins and then glances at Kayden. \u201cThe end of the Wicked Witch.\u201d He starts humming a tune from the Wizard of Oz as he backs toward the curtain entrance of the ride.</p><p>I step in first, since I\u2019ve been on such a roll lately. \u201cWho\u2019s the Wicked Witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll let him explain it to you.\u201d Luke looks at Kayden before ducking through the curtain into the entrance of the ride.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at Kayden. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about?\u201d</p><p>Kayden shrugs as he closes the gate. \u201cLuke\u2019s excited that Daisy and I broke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I try not to smile and finally have to bite down on my bottom lip, hard. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry.\u201d He reaches his arm over my shoulder and draws back the curtain for me. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u201d</p><p>It seems like it should be. They\u2019ve been dating forever, but he appears really content.</p><p>I lower my head and step into the ride, holding my breath as the curtains brush against the top of my hair. It\u2019s nearly pitch black and the sounds of screams and soft music envelop around me.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d I hiss with my hands out in front of me, my elbows locked. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>A lighter flickers and then Luke\u2019s face appears above the flame. \u201cThere we go.\u201d</p><p>Seth strolls up next to me, just a shadow in the dark, and thrums his fingers together in front of him. \u201cOh, are we going to do a s\u00e9ance?\u201d</p><p>Luke looks at Seth like he\u2019s nuts as Kayden moves up on the other side of me. I\u2019m very aware of his nearness and the smell of his cologne. It makes me nervous, yet excited at the endless possibilities.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the ingenious plan?\u201d Kayden asks, his breath flowing across the back of my head. \u201cAre we going to trash the place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d The lighter falls from Luke\u2019s hand and darkness takes over. \u201cAh, fuck! That\u2019s hot.\u201d</p><p>Seconds tick by and then Seth turns on the screen of his cell phone, which casts a blue glow over our faces. Luke nods as he picks up his lighter and drops it into the pocket of the hoodie, taking out his own cell phone to use for a light. He dips his hand into his other pocket and draws out a bottle filled with a golden liquid.</p><p>\u201cTequila? Where the hell did you get that?\u201d Kayden\u2019s fingers brush the lower section of my back, and I stifle a gasp clawing at my throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI bought it off one of the Carnies.\u201d He unscrews the cap and sniffs the inside of the bottle, pulling a thoughtful face. \u201cAlright, who\u2019s ready to get this party started?\u2019</p><p>Seth\u2019s gaze skims over the three of us. \u201cWhat kind of party are we talking about? Because honestly, I was trying to work something back at the ticket booth, but got a little distracted by the bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d I ask excitedly and he nods with pressing eyes.</p><p>I want to hug him, but I\u2019ll save it for later when he can give me the details. Seth hasn\u2019t dated anyone since Braiden and I hope he\u2019s ready to finally move on.</p> <p>Luke takes a swig from the bottle and his shoulders twitch as he swallows it. \u201cI want to do a challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo challenges tonight,\u201d Kayden grimaces, but there\u2019s a hint of amusement in his voice. \u201cWe have practice early in the morning and challenges always end in pain.\u201d</p><p>My head snaps toward him. \u201cPain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Seth says with a dramatic sigh. \u201cPlease explain what this challenge thing is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d Kayden waves us off with his hand and faces Luke. \u201cJust know that you don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just pissed off because you lost last time,\u201d Luke says in a taunting tone. \u201cBesides, I bet Callie would totally be into it. She seems tough for a tiny girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I start to protest as Luke takes another mouthful. \u201cI\u2019m not that tiny.\u201d</p><p>Kayden pinches my side and I flinch. \u201cActually, you are really tiny, but it\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>I cross my arms over my chest and inhale quietly, uncertain how to respond.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Callie,\u201d Kayden says, looking a little remorseful. \u201cNow, if you want to do the challenge we can, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve never been much of a curious person. I just did what I had to and stuck to myself, at least since my twelfth birthday, but curiosity sparkles inside me.</p> <p>\u201cI am kind of curious to see what your challenges are,\u201d I say and Kayden seems extremely pleased, the corners of his lips quirking as he struggles not to smile, even though he\u2019d just been protesting it.</p><p>Luke takes another mouthful of tequila and wipes his lips with his arm as he passes the bottle to Kayden. \u201cUsually we set up an obstacle course, like running and jumping and shit.\u201d He gestures his hand at the net above us. \u201cBut we got a prebuilt one right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? You just race?\u201d I ask as Kayden hands Seth the bottle, moving his arm around my back. \u201cAnd what does the winner get?\u201d</p><p>Seth tips his head back and takes a long, loud gulp. \u201cDamn that\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe satisfaction of winning.\u201d Kayden exchanges a look with Luke.</p><p>Luke stares up at the top. \u201cI say first one to the top and back is the winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say that this time the winner owes the other one a favor.\u201d Kayden steps around me and steers me to the side by the shoulders. \u201cLike letting the other one borrow their truck whenever they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Luke retorts. \u201cJust as long as when I win, I get to ride that motorcycle, that hasn\u2019t left your garage, when we go home for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my brother\u2019s,\u201d Kayden states with a noticeable rise in the pitch of his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou drove it once before,\u201d Luke protests.</p><p>\u201cAnd I got in deep shit for doing so.\u201d His breathing is ragged and tension swirls in the air.</p><p>He lets out a breath as Luke takes another drink with a challenge in his eyes. I\u2019ve heard the term \u201ctoo much testosterone,\u201d but never witnessed it until now.</p><p>\u201cFine, you got a deal.\u201d Kayden jerks the bottle from Luke\u2019s hand and throws his head back, pouring in a mouth full of tequila. \u201cBut I\u2019m not letting you win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll see.\u201d Luke steals the bottle back and wraps his lips around the top, knocking back a shot.</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d Seth shuffles toward the exit, staring at his phone. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to go find the person I was talking to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Kayden steps toward him. \u201cYou got to stay down here and call the winner.\u201d</p><p>Seth waves his hand at him, brushing him off. \u201cNah, Callie can do it.\u201d</p><p>Kayden shakes his head. \u201cCallie\u2019s in the challenge, remember?\u201d</p><p>I cringe, wondering what I\u2019ve gotten myself into. \u201cMaybe I should just stay here.\u201d</p><p>Kayden lowers his face toward mine and strands of his brown hair tickle my forehead. \u201cI thought you were going to prove to us you weren\u2019t little?\u201d</p><p>I glance up at the nets and ropes with doubt. \u201cHow am I supposed to do that? I see no possible way of me winning anything against you two.\u201d</p><p>He positions his fist in front of his chest with a wicked glint in his emerald eyes. \u201cWith your awesome kick boxing skills.\u201d</p><p>Luke snorts a laugh as he spills some tequila onto the ground. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Kayden lowers his fist, biting on his lip, with a look in his eyes that\u2019s very overpowering. \u201cWhat do you say? Can you handle it?\u201d</p><p>I nod, even though I don\u2019t think I can. \u201cAlright, so I just try to beat you guys to the top?\u201d</p><p>Kayden rubs his jawline. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>I follow them to the bottom step as they line up with their hands out to the side of them and their feet positioned to run. I feel short and small standing between them.</p><p>Seth stands near the curtains, checking the clock on his screen. \u201cDo you want me to just say go?\u201d</p><p>Kayden nods, without taking his eyes off the tunnel in front of us. \u201cYep, whenever. We\u2019re ready to go.\u201d</p><p>Seth glances at his clock again and then sighs. \u201cOn your mark, get set, go!\u201d</p><p>I skitter to the side as Luke shoves Kayden and then runs down the tunnel. Kayden recovers and dodges back onto the steps, sprinting down and disappearing into the darkness. I glance at Seth and he gestures for me to get my butt moving.</p><p>I walk quickly, ducking my head, and listening to the sounds of their footsteps that are already above me. Huddling over, I exit out of the tunnel and onto a wooden stairway. I step up, getting a little uneasy at how dark it is, but when I approach the next level the glow from the rides flow inside.</p><p>I hear the sound of Kayden\u2019s voice as he shouts something and I pick up my pace toward a bridge. It has netted sides and a rope for a railing. There are boards that pave the way to the other side and the floor sways underneath my feet as I step onto it. It\u2019s gone quiet and my adrenaline soars.</p><p>\u201cOkay, why did I agree to this?\u201d I mutter to myself. Then answer my own question. \u201cBecause Kayden looked at you with those sexy eyes.\u201d I step forward with my palms flat against the net to secure my balance.</p><p>\u201cCallie,\u201d Kayden suddenly whispers. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder and then grab onto the rope as the bridge rocks underneath my feet. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over here.\u201d His voice sounds close.</p><p>I squint through the darkness and then jump back. He\u2019s right on the other side of the net, watching me, which means he probably heard me talking to myself and calling him sexy.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been standing there?\u201d My voice sounds high.</p><p>He lets out a low laugh and it sends a shiver through my body that coils into my stomach, bursting heat downward. The sensation knocks me off balance and my cheeks heat.</p><p>\u201cYou think I have sexy eyes.\u201d His fingers thread the net as he stares at me through the dark from the other side.</p><p>\u201cYou heard that?\u201d My head falls forward to conceal my mortification.</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d His voice is deep and husky. I\u2019ve never had a guy use that kind of a voice on me.</p><p>I raise my chin up and encounter his intense gaze. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I thought I was alone.\u201d I shift my weight and the unsteadiness of the ground hurls me forward. I reach for the wall, lacing my fingers through the net and my knuckles brush his. Our faces are inches away. I can feel his breath and the heat from his body. If I leaned forward slightly, our lips would touch.</p><p>\u201cStay there,\u201d he says in a low whisper and removes his fingers from the net.</p><p>I watch the outline of him move through the dark as he walks down the side and turns the corner so he\u2019s standing at the end. The floor ripples under his steps and he holds onto the railing, heading straight for me.</p><p>I have no idea what he\u2019s going to do when he reaches me, but the intensity in the air and the way his long limbs move with determination, make me think it\u2019s going to be something I\u2019ve never experienced before.</p><p>I rotate my body to face him and lace my fingers through the holes of the net, with my back to the wall, and my arms bent up beside my head. It\u2019s dark enough that I can only see the outline of his face, but every once in a while the moving lights from outside shimmer in his eyes.</p><p>We\u2019re breathing wildly, our chests heaving as he halts in front of me.</p><p>\u201cI have a confession to make.\u201d He places a hand at the side of my head and grabs onto the net. \u201cThis was a set up.\u201d</p><p>I lick my lips nervously. \u201cWhat was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole challenge thing. I did it to get you up here alone.\u201d His other hand grips the net so my head is confined between his arms. My heart dances inside my chest as he whispers, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d</p><p>He leans in, shutting his eyes, and for a second I contemplate running. I keep my eyes open until the very last second, and then suck in a breath as his lips touch mine. My knees buckle as his tongue delves deep inside my mouth and I clutch onto the net to keep from falling down.</p><p>Without question or hesitation, I untangle my fingers from the holes, and slide my hands up his chest, wrapping them around his neck. His hot breath is mixed with passion and tequila and his chest crushes against mine. A gasp escapes from my lips as his searing hot palms move down my back. He thrusts his tongue deeper into my mouth and grabs at my hips, drawing me closer as the floor sways under our feet.</p><p>It\u2019s my first real kiss; one that wasn\u2019t taken away from me and held inside someone else\u2019s hand. I thought I\u2019d be more terrified, but if anything the nerves flying through my body are driven by the thrill of his tongue inside my mouth.</p><p>His hands slide from my hips to the perimeter of my butt. I flinch, starting to panic, but he intensifies the kiss, his tongue moving faster and with more determination. His fingers tangle through my hair, pulling my head back, so he can search my mouth more thoroughly, and I get lost in the moment. His fingers glide underneath my thighs, and grip tightly at my legs as he tugs me up and presses my back against the net wall. He urges my legs around his waist and I cross my ankles around his back, latching onto him.</p><p>My bottom lip quivers as I feel his hardness between my legs. It\u2019s mind blowing. And scary as hell.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>She\u2019s more inexperienced than I thought. Her hands are shaking as she knots her fingers through my hair and her bottom lip trembles as I massage it with my tongue. I\u2019ve totally gone A-wall with my plan to stay away from her, but that decision was made the second Luke suggested the stupid challenge plan we used to do to trick girls into going under the bleachers to make out with us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I realize the moment my lips touch hers that the day she came running up to the pool house to save my ass with her legs trembling, but her voice confident, something changed inside me. I have no idea what it is, but I know I want her, so fucking bad and I\u2019ve never wanted anyone. Not like this. Want equals dependency and that is not what I\u2019m looking for in my fucked up life.</p><p>I feel my way down her body, sucking her tongue into my mouth, and she lets out the sexiest moan I\u2019ve ever heard as she traces her fingers down the sides of my neck and grips at the fabric of my collar. I move my mouth away from hers, but only to trail soft kisses from the corner of her mouth, down her jawline, to the arch of her neck. My dick is pressed up against her and her warmth is radiating through my jeans. It feels so fucking good.</p><p>\u201cOh my God...\u201d She lets out a plea combined with a moan as my hand glides up to her breast and grips it. Her small body trembles in my arms and I swear I\u2019m going to lose it right then and there. I\u2019ve never felt like this before, with anyone. It\u2019s against the rules of surviving.</p><p>\u201cCallie,\u201d Seth\u2019s voice drifts up from somewhere. \u201cWe gotta go!\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m not ready to let go of her yet and allow the world to catch up with me. I clutch at her waist, wishing we could just stay up here, in the quiet. My head is tipped down as I breathe heavily against her neck with her chest heaving in my face as she tries to regain her breathing.</p><p>\u201cKayden.\u201d Her voice is soft, cautious, like she senses something\u2019s wrong. \u201cI think we need to go back down.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I inhale through my nose, and elevate my face away from her chest. I lower her legs to the ground and we head back across the bridge without talking to each other. When we reach the bottom and duck out of the curtain, Seth and Luke are waiting with a couple of guys in ratty t-shirts and torn jeans.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be up there.\u201d The tallest one says, spitting something nasty onto the ground.</p><p>\u201cWe were just leaving,\u201d I mutter as I shove by them and march for the parking lot, taking strides that are as long as possible, wanting to leave it all behind.</p> <p>By the time I reach the truck, the night crashes into my chest; the flirting, the games, the way she felt when I touched her, and how she reacted. I feel everything and I need to get it out of me.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>#43 Face Your Fears Head On and Tell Them to Fuck Off</p><p>Callie</p><p>I drive home with Seth from the carnival. Kayden looks like he\u2019s going to be sick, so I don\u2019t ask too many questions when he says he needs to ride back with Luke and call it a night.</p><p>When we get to my door, the red scarf is on the knob again and I frown. Seth and I don\u2019t say anything as we walk across the campus yard in the chilled air and go into his empty room. He sinks down on his bed and starts to unlace his boots as I slip off my sneakers.</p> <p>I stand there in the middle of the room, recollecting every detail that happened. The way Kayden\u2019s hands touched me, the feel of his lips, how it felt so incredibly good.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to share what that weird look on your face is about?\u201d Seth kicks his boots into the corner and lies down on his bed with his hands tucked behind his head.</p><p>I lie down next to him and rest my cheek on the pillow. \u201cYou really want to know?\u201d</p><p>He glances at me from the corner of his eyes. \u201cHeck yeah. You look like you\u2019re high.\u201d He pauses, propping up on his elbow as he pivots to his side. \u201cWait a minute. Is that what you were doing up there? Were you getting high?\u201d</p><p>I swat his arm. \u201cNo... we were... kissing.\u201d</p><p>He laughs at me. \u201cYou say that like it\u2019s so wrong.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, picking at my fingernails. \u201cIt feels like it should be wrong... the last time someone kissed me that\u2019s how it felt.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head and sighs. \u201cThat\u2019s because the last time it was wrong, but not this time. This time it was right and both of you wanted it. Right?\u201d</p> <p>I nod slowly, trying to hold back a smile, but it sneaks through. \u201cIt was a really nice kiss.\u201d</p><p>He springs up on his knees and puts his hands on top of his legs. \u201cOkay, tell me how it went. What were you doing? And how did it happen?\u201d</p><p>I sit up and lean against the wooden headboard. \u201cHe said that whole challenge thing was a set up to get me up there.\u201d</p><p>Seth rolls his brown eyes. \u201cWell, duh. I got that they were up to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I feel stupid. \u201cI thought they were just being guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh they were,\u201d he assures me. \u201cRelax, it was all for fun and he got to kiss you just like he was trying to do the whole night.\u201d</p><p>I pull the pillow onto my lap, reliving it over and over again in my mind. \u201cYeah, but did Kayden seem a little offish when we left?\u201d</p><p>Seth shrugs. \u201cHe seemed tired, but not offish.\u201d</p><p>I yank the elastic out of my hair, gather the strands into a messy bun, and secure the band around it. \u201cWhat happened with that guy you were talking about?\u201d</p><p>He reaches his hand into his pocket and takes out his phone. Flicking the screen with his finger, he shows it to me. \u201cI got his number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d I incline back against the headboard. \u201cAre you going to go out with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d He drops the phone onto the desk at the foot of the bed and then lies back down, glancing at the picture on the wall. \u201cGod, it was such a great night.\u201d</p><p>I slide my body down and lay flat on the bed, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cIt really was.\u201d</p><p>And at that moment, I mean it.</p><p>I wake up in the middle of the night dripping in sweat, unable to tell where the hell I am. The sound of heavy breathing drifts up from the warm body lying beside me. I sit up, blinking around the dark, clutching at the blankets, panting feverishly, trying to shake my dream.</p><p>\u201cCallie, listen to me,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you tell anyone about this, you\u2019re going to get into trouble and I\u2019m going to have to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>My small body trembles, my muscles are sore, and my body and mind is bruised. Tears stain my eyes as I blink up at my bedroom ceiling with my hands lifeless at my sides, my fingers clutching the comforter.</p><p>\u201cCallie do you understand me?\u201d His face is getting red and the tone of his voice is sharp.</p><p>I nod, unable to speak, gripping the blankets tighter.</p><p>He climbs off me and zips up his pants, then backs away to the door, putting his finger to his lips. \u201cThis is our little secret.\u201d</p><p>When he disappears out the door, I gasp for air, but my lungs won\u2019t work. I can\u2019t breathe. Letting go of the blanket, I stumble off the bed and run to the bathroom, leaning my head over the toilet bowl. I heave my guts out until my stomach is empty, but I still feel dirty inside, spoiled, rotten, foul. It\u2019s killing me, gnawing away at my insides and I need to get it out.</p><p>I shove my finger down my throat, desperate to get rid of it. I push and gag until my throat bleeds and tears slide down my cheeks. My shoulders shake as I stare at the trail of blood on the floor and listen to the sounds of the kids just outside, laughing and playing hide-and-seek.</p><p>I gasp for air, dragging my fingernails down my neck. \u201cGo away. Go away,\u201d I whisper and Seth lets out a loud snore.</p><p>I hop out of bed and search the floor for my shoes, needing to get rid of the feelings beginning to surface. But I can\u2019t find my shoes. It\u2019s too dark. I yank at my hair wanting to rip it out and scream.</p><p>Finally, I give up and sneak out the door bare foot. The hallway is vacant and I run to the end of it where the bathrooms are. Locking myself in the farthest stall, I kneel down on the cold hard tile floor, lean my head over the toilet, and jab my finger down my throat.</p><p>As the vomit surfaces I start to feel better. I keep pushing and pushing until I brink the end and my stomach is empty. Calmness settles over me as I take back control.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>The next morning, after Callie and I made out in the jungle gym, I wake up with my mind crammed with a lot of shit. I climb out of bed and start packing a bag, shoving in a few shirts and an extra pair of jeans. Then I zip it up and swing the handle over my shoulder.</p><p>Luke is lying on his bed, face down and I shake his shoulder. He rolls over with his fists up, ready to take a swing at my face. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I need a favor.\u201d I collect my wallet and phone off the dresser.</p><p>He relaxes. \u201cWhat favor? And why do you have a bag packed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to borrow your truck.\u201d I adjust the bag higher on my shoulder. \u201cFor a few days.\u201d</p><p>He blinks again, still out of it as he reaches for his watch on the nightstand. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d He rubs his eyes and then gapes up at me. \u201cIt\u2019s six o\u2019clock in the fucking morning. Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to get away from here for a while,\u201d I say. \u201cI need to clear my head.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, he scoots up so he\u2019s sitting. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack home,\u201d I say, knowing it\u2019s stupid to go back, but it\u2019s all I know. There is nowhere else for me and staying here means dealing with shit I just can't deal with and Callie deserves better. \u201cI thought I\u2019d go check up on my mom and make sure everything is okay there.\u201d</p><p>He rubs his forehead and glances at the sun rising over the mountains. \u201cYou know I\u2019m going to be stranded here if you take my truck? What am I supposed to do? Stay here for the entire weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can borrow someone else\u2019s car.\u201d I turn around, looking for his keys and then scoop them up from off the desk.</p><p>\u201cI guess I can get a ride from Seth.\u201d He frowns. \u201cGod dammit. This better be important.\u201d</p><p>My stomach tenses. \u201cIt is. In fact, it\u2019s kind of a matter of life and death.\u201d I walk out the door without saying another word, the bandages beneath my shirt hidden, but I feel the pain. It\u2019s all I feel.</p><p>Driving back home is a fucking downer, but if I hang around the campus, I\u2019m going to want to be near Callie and it\u2019s unhealthy for both of us. I do the only thing I know. I go back home, hoping I can clear my head of her.</p><p>When I park the truck in front of the two-story house, though, every single memory rushes back to me. The fists, the beatings, the yelling, the blood. It\u2019s all connected to me, like the veins under my skin and the scars on my body, along with this house, and what\u2019s inside it\u2014it\u2019s all I have.</p><p>It takes me a second to work up the courage to open the truck door. My boots land in a puddle as I step out. Leaning back inside, I grab my bag from the passenger seat, and slam the door. Draping the handle over my shoulder, I head up the path lined with red and green Venus Fly Traps. The leaves from the trees have fallen, and the neighbor\u2019s son is out raking them up from the grass.</p><p>Each year, my mom pays someone to come clean them up, because my dad hates them in the yard. They\u2019re dead and pointless and look like shit, he says.</p><p>I wave at him as I trot up the stairs to the front porch. Freezing in front of the screen, I take a deep breath and step inside. It\u2019s exactly the same as when I left. There is no dust on the pictures in the foyer or on the banister leading upstairs. The floor has been polished, the glass on the windows are wiped clean. I walk up to a family portrait hanging on the farthest wall and squint at it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mom and dad sit in the center, and my two older brothers and I stand around them. We\u2019re smiling and look like a happy family. But Tyler has a tooth missing from where he banged his face on the table when my dad was chasing him. Dylan has a brace on his wrist from falling out of a tree when he climbed up it to hide from my father. Even though it isn\u2019t visible in the picture, I have a bruise on my shin the size of a baseball from getting kicked by my dad after I accidentally spilt cereal all over the floor.</p><p>I wonder why no one questioned our injuries, but maybe that\u2019s why we were always playing sports. As soon as we turned the right age, we were thrown into soccer, t-ball, and when we got a little older, basketball and football. These were good excuses that my mom gladly passed around.</p><p>I thought about telling someone a few times when I got old enough that my brain could grasp the idea, but the fear and embarrassment stopped me. Besides, I shut down at an early age. After that pain was just pain. I can do pain. That\u2019s the easy part of life. It\u2019s everything else, happiness, laughter, love, that\u2019s fucking complicated.</p><p>Callie</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m nervous about seeing Kayden,\u201d I admit to Seth as he walks me to my room. Neither of us have class this morning, so we decide to go out to breakfast, just him and me so we can talk.</p><p>Fortunately, the scarf isn\u2019t on the doorknob and when I open the door, Violet isn\u2019t in the room. Although, she\u2019s left soda cans everywhere and there\u2019s a nasty looking sandwich on the desk.</p><p>\u201cCan I make a suggestion?\u201d Seth says, observing Violet\u2019s unmade bed. \u201cPlease spray disinfectant everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuggestion taken.\u201d I grab a plaid shirt and a pair of jeans out of the dresser. \u201cCan you step out so I can change?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, he backs out the door. \u201cHurry up though, I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p> <p>When he shuts the door, I slip out of my shirt that smells like cotton candy mixed with cigarette smoke. I inhale the scent, remembering how it felt when Kayden kissed me, before I toss the shirt on the bed and insert my arms through the sleeves of a plaid shirt. I pull on a pair of jeans and then grab a brush to put my hair up, but pause, thinking about my fears and how Seth told me this morning that I should tell them to fuck off.</p><p>After the incident last night, before I returned to Seth\u2019s room and went back to bed, I promised myself it would never happen again. When I woke up, I felt better.</p><p>I slip the elastic out and let my hair hang down to my shoulders. \u201cYou can do this,\u201d I mutter, grabbing my bag. \u201cYou made out with a guy for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>When I step out the door, there\u2019s a smile on my face, but my happiness vanishes when I see Seth talking to Luke, and neither of them look happy. Luke is wearing black jeans and a black fitted t-shirt. It\u2019s a lot of black, but it works for him</p><p>When Seth catches my eyes, his expression is filled with sympathy and pity.</p><p>My eyebrows furrow as I stroll up to them. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>Luke has a guilty look on his face as he turns around. \u201cHey, Callie, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>I fiddle with the strands of my hair, tucking them behind my ear. \u201cNothing much. Seth and I are just heading out to get some breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we were just talking about that.\u201d Luke hurries backwards down the hall, like he\u2019s desperate to get away from me. \u201cI was asking Seth if I could borrow his car, but I\u2019ll just find someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Where\u2019s your truck?\u201d I ask, and his shoulders stiffen as he pauses in the center of the hall.</p><p>\u201cKayden took it somewhere.\u201d He waves at me, before spinning on his heels and hurrying off. \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you two later.\u201d He disappears between a group of cheerleaders, dressed in their uniforms.</p><p>I turn to Seth, confused. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>He stares at me contemplatively, then sighs and loops his arm through mine. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>We step out into the crisp autumn air and beneath the cloudy sky. The liveliness of the campus yard surges around us and yellow and orange leaves skitter across the dying grass.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to tell me why you\u2019re looking at me like you\u2019re about to tell me my dog died?\u201d I wonder as we step off the curb of the sidewalk and down onto the asphalt of the parking lot.</p><p>He looks left and right, before we hurry over to his car. \u201cI have something to tell you and I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to take it.\u201d He frees my arm and we part ways, going to opposite sides of the car.</p><p>When we get in and shut the doors, he turns the key in the ignition and pauses as he scrolls through his playlists on an iPod. \u201cKayden borrowed Luke\u2019s truck.\u201d A song pops on as he places the iPod back into the stand on the dashboard. \u201cTo go back home for a few days.\u201d</p><p>I fasten the seatbelt over my shoulder. \u201cOkay, why are you acting weird?\u201d</p><p>He shoves the shifter into reverse and looks over his shoulder as he backs out of the parking space. \u201cWell, because he didn\u2019t say anything to you.\u201d He straightens the wheel and merges the car out onto the road. \u201cWait a minute. Did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but why would he? We barely know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie, you made out with him last night and let him feel your boob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I told you that in confidence.\u201d</p><p>He raises his fingers up from the wheel. \u201cRelax, I\u2019m just pointing out that that was a big step for you\u2014an important step. You wouldn\u2019t just do it with any guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Kayden,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean he has to tell me everything he does. I\u2019m not his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Seth turns down the volume of the stereo. \u201cHe should have said something instead of just taking off. He knew you\u2019d probably want to see him. You know his darkest secret, Callie, which is the hardest part about getting to know someone.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quoting his Psych 101 on me, so I fold my arms and stare out the window, watching the leaves blow across the street and into the gutter.</p><p>When I get back to my room later that day, I write until my hand hurts, needing to get it out, but only daring to tell it to a blank sheet of paper. There are no accusations with writing, no judgment, no shame, only freedom. As the pen touches the paper, for a moment, I\u2019m alive.</p><p>The day I changed is like a scar. It\u2019s there, a memory in my mind, something I always remember and can never erase. It was the week after my birthday party. I\u2019d locked myself in the bathroom and stared in the mirror for an eternity. I used to love how I looked, the length of my hair, perfect for braiding. I had always been tiny for my age, but suddenly I wanted to be smaller\u2014invisible. I didn\u2019t want to exist anymore.</p><p>I grabbed a pair of scissors out of the drawer and without even thinking, began hacking off my long brown hair. I didn\u2019t even bother trying to make it look nice, I just cut, even shutting my eyes sometimes, letting fate take over, like it had done with my life.</p><p>\u201cThe uglier the better,\u201d I whispered with each snip.</p><p>When I was finished, I didn\u2019t look like myself. I hadn\u2019t been sleeping very well and my blue eyes had dark circles under them and my lips were chapped from dehydration from all the vomiting. I felt ugly and the thought formed a tiny smile on my face, because I knew no one would look at me and want to come near me again.</p><p>When I walked into the kitchen, with my brother\u2019s jacket on and the baggiest pair of jeans I could find, all the color drained from my mom\u2019s face. My father had been eating his breakfast at the table and looked up at me with horror in his eyes. My brother and Caleb stared at me too, making repulsed faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck happened to you?\u201d My brother said with wide eyes.</p><p>I didn\u2019t reply. I just stood there, blinking at him, wishing I could be smaller.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Callie,\u201d my mom breathed, her eyes so wide they looked like marbles. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and grabbed my bag off the doorknob. \u201cI cut my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look... you look.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cYou look hideous, Callie. I\u2019m not going to lie. You\u2019ve ruined yourself.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m more ruined than you think, I wanted to tell her. But she kept looking at me in disgust, like she wished for a second I didn\u2019t exist and I felt exactly the same way. I bottled everything up, knowing I could never tell; that she would look at me with even more hate and revulsion if I told her.</p><p>For the first few years of my turmoil, she tried to understand. And I give her credit for that. She asked questions, took me to talk to a counselor, who told her that I was acting out because I needed more attention. He was a small town shrink and had no idea what he was talking about, although I didn\u2019t try to help him understand either. I didn\u2019t want him to know what was living on the inside. At that point, all the good and clean had been spoiled and was rotten like eggs left out in the sun.</p><p>The thing about my mother is she likes things happy. She hates seeing bad things on the news and refuses to watch it. She won\u2019t read the headlines of the newspapers and doesn\u2019t like talking about the pain in the world.</p><p>\u201cJust because the world is full of bad things, doesn\u2019t mean I have to let them bring me down.\u201d This is what she would say to me all the time. \u201cI deserve to be happy.\u201d</p><p>So I let my shame own me, kill me, wilt me away into a thousand dead flakes, knowing if I kept it all in, she would never have to learn the dirtiness that was forever inside me\u2014the bad, the ugly, the twisted. She could go on living her life happy, just like she deserved.</p><p>Eventually, she stopped asking me so many questions and started telling everyone that I was suffering from teenage angst, just like the therapist told her.</p><p>I heard her tell the neighbor once, after he accused me of stealing his garden gnomes, that I wasn\u2019t that bad of a kid. That one day, I would grow up and look back at my silly little time spent locked away in my room, writing dark words, wearing excessive eyeliner and baggy clothes as something I wished I\u2019d never done. That I\u2019d regret my lonely adolescence, learn from it, and grow into a beautiful woman who had a lot of friends and smiled at the world.</p><p>But the thing I regret\u2014will always regret\u2014is going into my room on my twelfth birthday.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>#49 Tell the Truth to Yourself</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I\u2019ve been at my house for two days now, and I\u2019ve almost returned to the place I ran away from. My dad hasn\u2019t hit me yet or anything, but I\u2019m afraid of him, just like when I was a child.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck did you leave that piece of shit truck parked out front?\u201d he asks when he walks into the kitchen. He\u2019s wearing a suit, even though he doesn\u2019t have to work today. He just likes looking important.</p><p>\u201cBecause the garage is full.\u201d I butter my toast as quietly as possible because my dad hates the noise the knife makes against the dry bread.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d He opens the cupboard and takes out a box of cereal. \u201cYou need to get it out of here. It\u2019s leaking oil all over the driveway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I bite into my toast. \u201cI\u2019ll find somewhere to put it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He steps in front of me and I freeze. His green eyes are harsh, his jawline taut, his expression indifferent. \u201cI think you forgot something.\u201d</p><p>I force the bread down my throat. \u201cFine, sir, I\u2019ll find somewhere else to put it.\u201d</p><p>He eyes me with intimidation for a second longer, before stepping back. \u201cAnd you better come back and clean those crumbs off the counter.\u201d</p><p>I inhale through my nose as I move for the doorway. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p> <p>He takes out a bowl from the dishwasher and I hurry out of the house. Why can\u2019t I just hit him? I thought about it a few times when I was younger, but was always afraid he would retaliate twenty times harder. By the time I got older and bigger, something had died inside me and I didn\u2019t really care. I let him kick me, hit me, wishing he\u2019d finally go over the edge and it\u2019d all be over.</p><p>That is until the night he almost did and Callie showed up and saved me.</p><p>My phone rings and I retrieve it from my pocket as Daisy\u2019s name pops up on the screen.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I answer, jogging down the steps of the front porch.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she says in the high-pitched voice she uses when she\u2019s around her friends. \u201cHow\u2019s my favorite guy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you excited to hear from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard from you a few days ago,\u201d I say. \u201cWhen you made it very clear we weren\u2019t a couple anymore. Or actually, Luke did when he told me you were fucking around with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, he has such a vendetta against me,\u201d she snaps. \u201cIt\u2019s like he wants us to break up. I never got why you were friends with him. He\u2019s not even like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Daisy?\u201d My tone is clipped as I hike across the grass toward the old truck, stuffing the last of the toast into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI want you to take me to homecoming, like you promised.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promised that when we were together.\u201d</p><p>She sighs dramatically. \u201cLook, I know you\u2019re mad at me, but I don\u2019t have a date and I\u2019ve been nominated for Homecoming Queen. The last thing I want to do is be alone when they call my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s a ton of guys that would love to take you.\u201d And get into your pants.</p><p>\u201cBut I want you to take me,\u201d she complains. \u201cPlease, Kayden, I need this.\u201d</p><p>The phone vibrates and I pause at the end of the lawn, quickly switching the screen to text messages.</p><p>Callie: I wanted to see if u were okay. Luke told me u had to go home. If u need anything let me know.</p><p>I shake my head at her sweet message. She\u2019s worried about me. No one has ever been worried about me before.</p><p>\u201cGod dammit, I can\u2019t do this,\u201d I mutter, kicking at the dirt. \u201cI can\u2019t be with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d Daisy says. \u201cAll you have to do is pick me up at seven.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t talking to her, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I need a distraction. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll take you, but I\u2019m not going to the party afterwards.\u201d</p><p>We hang up and I have the most sickening feeling in my stomach. As I pull the truck onto the street, I almost head east to the freeway, toward the campus. But as I glance down at the scars on my knuckles, I head west, towards town to park the truck somewhere and then drive back home to take Daisy to the prom.</p><p>Callie</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday night,\u201d Seth says and he runs some gel through his hair. \u201cYou have to go out with me. There is no way in hell I\u2019m going to let you stay in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I lift up a stack of textbooks in search of my notebook. Honestly, I\u2019m feeling a little down after Kayden never returned my text. He\u2019s probably just busy, though. \u201cYou\u2019re totally looking into this Kayden thing too much.\u201d</p><p>He sits down in front of the computer, swiveling the chair as he scrolls through his Facebook page. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been the one looking at your sad puppy dog eyes for the last two days.\u201d</p><p>I drop the stack of books and put my hands on my hips. \u201cWhere the heck did I leave my notes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left them in your room,\u201d he says. \u201cRemember we dropped them off while...\u201d He trails off and then promptly shuts the screen down. When he swivels the chair around to look at me, his brown eyes are enlarged. \u201cI have a brilliant idea. Why don\u2019t you and I just go out? I can blow off Greyson and you and I can go see that silly movie you\u2019ve been wanting to see.\u201d</p><p>I flop down on his bed. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m not going to ruin the first date you\u2019ve had in almost forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease Callie, just come out with me and have some fun.\u201d</p><p>I prop up on my elbows. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019re acting like a weirdo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I am a weirdo.\u201d He stands up from the chair without looking at me and shoves boxes aside with his foot so he can open the closet door. \u201cI think I need to tell you something that you might be upset about, but that I feel you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay... what is it?\u201d</p><p>He removes a hanger from the bar and takes his jacket off of it. \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s just go out and do something crazy.\u201d</p><p>I ease out of bed and stand up. \u201cSeth, please tell me what\u2019s going on. You have me worried.\u201d</p><p>He sighs, leaning back into the closet to put the hanger back on the bar. \u201cPlease don\u2019t let this ruin your progress, but while I was on Facebook, I saw that Kayden had tagged himself with Daisy McMillian at the homecoming dance.\u201d</p><p>I bite down on my tongue until it hurts. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He zips up his jacket and picks up the keys off the desk. \u201cDo you want to change first, before we go out?\u201d</p><p>I grab my bag off the bed. \u201cI think I\u2019m just going to go back to my room and study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth, I\u2019ll be okay. Now go on your date and have a lot of fun for the both of us.\u201d</p><p>I dash out of the room before he can try to persuade me. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about Kayden. I thought I was getting somewhere with my life. I thought I could smell the possibilities in the air.</p><p>Guess I was wrong.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I slip into my dorm room in the middle of the night, still wearing the tux with my bag in my hand. When I turn on the light, Luke sits up, blinks his eyes, and shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we have got to come up with a system where you quit waking me up.\u201d He studies my tux. \u201cSo that tag was right? You really went with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I picked her up and while I ran inside to pay for the gas, she took my phone and did that herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t go to the dance with her? You just what? Wanted to get dressed up for fun?\u201d</p><p>I tug the bowtie off my neck. \u201cNo, I made it to the parking lot, before I had a revelation.\u201d</p><p>He glances over at the clock. \u201cI\u2019ve heard those are pretty life changing.\u201d</p><p>I shuck off my jacket and toss it on the floor. \u201cThis one might have been... maybe. And you\u2019ll be pretty happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause part of it was that I realized Daisy is a bitch.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cFinally. Took you long enough. You know, you\u2019re kind of slow.\u201d</p><p>I sit down on the bed and start to untie my shoes.</p><p>The revelation was actually simple. During the drive to the school, Daisy had been yammering about how the manicurist messed up her nails. She kept rambling on and on and I started noticing little details about her, like the way her nose scrunched when she was talking or the dryness of her hair. She kept making her voice sound ditzy and when she reached over to touch my leg, I felt like flinging it off my lap.</p><p>She kept insulting everyone, so I tried to change the subject and make a joke, but she didn\u2019t laugh. In fact, she looked at me for a second like she was wondering what she was doing with me. Then I began wondering what I was doing with her.</p><p>I dropped her off at the school and shoved the shifter into park. \u201cHave fun.\u201d</p><p>She gaped at me. \u201cWhat? You\u2019re not coming in?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head with a small smile on my lips. \u201cI should have never been here to begin with.\u201d</p><p>She threatened me with everything she could think of, before getting out of the car. I drove away, picked up my bag from the house, and headed back to the campus, feeling a weight lift from my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I am kind of slow.\u201d I pick up my shoes and drop them into the closet. \u201cHey, did you see Callie at all while I was gone? I found an earring in your truck and I think it\u2019s hers.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment and then shifts in his bed. \u201cI have to ask you something about her. Just how much do you like her?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, because I really don\u2019t know. \u201cShe\u2019s nice and interesting.\u201d I shrug again, conflicted. \u201cWhy are you asking me such a fucking weird question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, tonight, I ran into Seth out in the parking lot,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he informed me that Callie found out you were at homecoming with Daisy.\u201d</p><p>I grab my jacket and head for the closet to get a hanger, my steps slowing down as I realize what it means. \u201cDid he say if she was upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure was,\u201d Luke replies. \u201cHe yelled at me for like ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>I insert the ends of the hanger through the sleeves of the jacket. \u201cI should probably go talk to her.\u201d I grab a t-shirt and some pajama bottoms from my bag and walk back to the closet to change so Luke doesn\u2019t see my hideous scars.</p><p>\u201cYeah, good luck with that.\u201d Luke collapses back onto the bed, yawning. \u201cBecause I\u2019m pretty sure Seth isn\u2019t going to let you anywhere near her ever again.\u201d</p><p>My heart constricts inside my chest at the idea. Even though I keep telling myself to stay away from her, it hurts thinking that it might actually happen. I admit the truth about my feelings for the first time in my life. I actually have them. And I have them for Callie. Now what I\u2019m supposed to do with them I have no fucking idea.</p><p>The next morning I wake up early because I can\u2019t sleep. I have this reoccurring dream where I\u2019m back at the pool house and my father is beating me. This time though, Callie doesn\u2019t show up, and his fists continue to smash into my face over and over again until I black out.</p><p>I get dressed and walk over to the shop across the street to get a coffee. I\u2019m on my way back to the campus when Callie appears at the end of the sidewalk. She has a book in her hand, reading while she heads in my direction, oblivious to the people and cars moving by her. Her hair is braided to the side, with loose strands framing her face, and her jacket is zipped half way up. Her tight jeans show how breakable she is.</p><p>I wait for her by the street post and she doesn\u2019t glance up at me until the last second.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d I say, trying not to worry about the fact that she\u2019s stopped several feet away from me. I move over to her slowly, taking a sip of my coffee. \u201cWhat are you reading? You looked totally into it.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze lingers on me and I squirm. She lifts the book up and taps the cover where the title is. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSister Carrie,\u201d I read aloud.</p><p>She lowers the book to her side with her finger in the binding to mark the page. \u201cIt\u2019s for my American Literature class, which I\u2019m supposed to be at in an hour. I was supposed to read it last night, but I couldn\u2019t find the book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d I\u2019m at a loss for words hearing the tightness in her voice.</p><p>She punches the crosswalk button on the pole with her thumb. \u201cDid you have a nice trip back home?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was okay,\u201d I say, waiting for her to call me out.</p><p>She hitches her thumb under the handle of her bag and scoots it higher on her shoulder as she watches the crosswalk sign in front of her. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>It grows silent as she returns to reading. I watch her lips move along with the words as she reads silently; the lips that I know are ridiculously soft and barely touched. I could tell that hardly anyone had kissed her and something about that draws me to her even more, like she trusted me enough to be one of them. Probably not now, though.</p><p>\u201cHey, I think we need to talk,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s some stuff I want to tell you.\u201d</p><p>The light on the sign changes and she glances up at it. \u201cI can\u2019t talk right now. I have to get a coffee and stop by the library before class.\u201d</p> <p>She starts across the street, and I grab her sleeve. \u201cCallie, I owe you an explanation.\u201d</p><p>Her muscles stiffen as she glances down at my hand on her arm and then up at me. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t. I promise. I didn\u2019t think we were dating or anything.\u201d She wiggles out of my grasp and hurries across the street.</p><p>I start to call out to her that she\u2019s wrong, that I owe her everything, but she starts to run, like she wants nothing more than to get away from me.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>#3 Do Whatever the Hell You Want for Once Instead of What You Think You Should Do</p><p>Callie</p> <p>I\u2019m avoiding him. I told myself a thousand times that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but I\u2019m \u201cunstable\u201d as Seth so pleasantly told me during History class. He also told me that I cut my ties with Kayden because when he left, he took some of my \u201ctrust\u201d with him.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you keep making air quotes?\u201d I ask, picking up my bag off the floor.</p><p>Professor Jennerly glances back at us from the front of the classroom and then continues on with his lecture, pacing in front of the class with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Seth leans over the desk and whispers, \u201cBecause I\u2019m quoting what it said in my Psych book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Psych book talked about my problem?\u201d I put my bag on my desk and unzip it.</p><p>\u201cNot specifically, but it was close.\u201d He sticks the end of the pen in his mouth as he returns upright in his chair.</p><p>I drop my books into my bag and by the time I\u2019m finished packing, class is being let out. We wait until the room has almost cleared before we head down the stairs.</p><p>Professor Jennerly, a tall man with salt and pepper hair and thick-framed glasses, waits for us by the door. \u201cMy classroom is not for outside chitchat,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you two want to talk, then I suggest you stay out of my class.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re sorry,\u201d Seth says and then rolls his eyes at me. \u201cIt\u2019ll never happen again.\u201d</p><p>We walk down the packed hallway. Outside the windows, the metallic football stadium stretches in the distance and the metal gleams in the sunshine.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking about him?\u201d Seth asks.</p><p>I tear my gaze away from the window and scoot over for a group of guys taking up half the hall. \u201cThinking about whom?\u201d</p><p>He angles his head to the side with a pucker at his brow. \u201cCallie, you need to just forget about him or talk to him. You can\u2019t keep avoiding him, yet wanting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him,\u201d I lie and when he frowns at me, I sigh. \u201cAlright, fine. Yes, I think about him. A lot. But I\u2019ll get over him. God knows I barely know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you two have shared a lot,\u201d he says and presses his hand flat on the door to push it open. \u201cYou saved him. He was the first guy you ever trusted. He gave you your first real kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trusted you first.\u201d I rummage through my purse for my gum as the breeze whisks through my hair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the same.\u201d He releases the door and it clicks shut. \u201cI\u2019m a friend. Kayden is more to you than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true.\u201d I take out the gum and wiggle a piece out of the pack. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I feel for him or if it is good or bad. In fact, sometimes I just feel like a scared little girl who doesn\u2019t know what to do with anything.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me with pity as we amble underneath a canopy of bare branches with the sunlight shimmering through them. \u201cWell, maybe you should just do whatever the hell you want, instead of what you think you should do.\u201d</p><p>I stab a finger at him with accusation in my eyes. \u201cYou just quoted that from the list.\u201d</p><p>He laughs wickedly, throwing his head back and his blond hair falls out of his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s the quote of the day. Didn\u2019t you get the memo?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, laughing at him. \u201cDarn it. I forgot to check my messages today. I must have missed it.\u201d</p><p>He swings his arm around my shoulder. \u201cThe question is: what do you want to do? And I mean really, really want?\u201d</p><p>I stop in front of the bench, considering what he asked, and staring out at the large stadium in the distance. \u201cI want to have fun.\u201d</p><p>Kayden</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really in the partying mood.\u201d I spray some cologne onto my shirt and click the cap back on. \u201cI\u2019d rather just stay in and catch up on sleep. I feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re depressed.\u201d Luke pulls open the dresser drawer and searches through his shirts, finally selecting a long-sleeved one. \u201cOver someone who I can\u2019t mention or else you\u2019re going to look at me like you want to kill me.\u201d</p><p>I run my fingers through my hair. \u201cThat\u2019s such a fucking lie.\u201d</p><p>He loops a belt through his jeans with an exaggerated eye widening. \u201cWe should just walk, right? That way, no one will have to be responsible for driving back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do realize the party is three blocks down at Campus Habitat. We\u2019d be stupid to drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was at one of the apartments farther down?\u201d</p><p>I check my messages and then hold down the side button, locking the screen. \u201cNope, it\u2019s only a few streets over from this one.\u201d</p><p>He grabs his jacket off the back of the computer chair. \u201cThat makes the DD situation even better.\u201d</p><p>We lock up and head outside. It\u2019s late, the stars are out, and the lampposts gleam against the concrete. There are a group of girls in tight dresses and high heels, traveling in the same direction we are.</p><p>We end up behind them and Luke\u2019s wheels are turning as he eyes the tallest one\u2019s ass. \u201cI think a challenge would be lovely right about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you could just go hit on her. That always works, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly when you\u2019re my wing man.\u201d He glances at me, testing my reaction. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, even though I don\u2019t want to. \u201cI can go up there with you.\u201d</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cAlright, if that\u2019s the way you want to be.\u201d</p><p>We strut up to the girls and Luke starts making conversation with the girl he was checking out. A shorter one with blond curls, wearing a red dress, starts talking to me, but I barely hear her. I\u2019m preoccupied by thoughts of Callie and what I\u2019d be doing if I were actually with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d definitely not be going to a party,\u201d I mutter to myself. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>The girl that\u2019s been chatting to me blinks confusedly. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really nice night,\u201d I say and she laughs, but her eyebrows knit.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of noise coming from the hot tub that\u2019s around the side of the three-story apartment that the party is taking place at. I hold the door open for everyone to walk in.</p><p>Luke is making a joke as he enters and the other two girls walk in behind him, whispering and giggling to each other. It\u2019s annoying me to no end, and by the time I\u2019m knocking my fist against the door, I can\u2019t wait to get inside and ditch them.</p><p>One of the members of the football team, Ben, is throwing the party. He\u2019s a nice guy, although I don\u2019t really know him. When he swings the door open, however, it would appear that we\u2019re best friends.</p><p>\u201cKayden, man.\u201d He sticks out his hand to pound fists.</p><p>I bump mine against his and arch my eyebrows. \u201cHey, man.\u201d</p><p>He looks over my shoulder at Luke and the girls. \u201cYou brought guests.\u201d Grinning, he steps aside so we can come in.</p><p>The apartment is much bigger than my dorm. Music plays from the stereo and there\u2019s a foldup table in the corner where a poker game is going on. Alcohol bottles line the counter inside the kitchen, along with cups, chips, and a bunch of other food. In between the couches a horde of people are dancing.</p><p>My eyes zero in on a girl with her brown hair pulled up in a clip, wearing black jeans with a pair of lace up boots and a purple tank top. She\u2019s talking with a guy, laughing and shaking her ass as she really gets into the music.</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d No matter how many times I blink, it doesn\u2019t seem real.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to get a drink?\u201d The girl I walked in with coils her hair around her finger as she gazes up at me, biting her bottom lip.</p><p>I shake my head and my attention returns to Callie. \u201cMaybe in a minute.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s dancing with Seth, who\u2019s really getting into the music as they shout out the lyrics with the crowd and then laugh, raising their hands in the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d Luke wonders as he steps up beside me. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like their scene.\u201d</p><p>Seth notices us and leans forward to say something in Callie\u2019s ear. She turns her head and looks at us. Her face lights up and she weaves around people toward me with Seth at her heels. For a second, I wonder if I\u2019ve fallen asleep and this is all a dream because she looks really happy to see me.</p><p>When she reaches me, she flings her arms around my neck, and I can smell the vodka on her breath. \u201cKayden\u2019s here,\u201d she says, hugging me so tightly it kind of hurts.</p><p>My breathing speeds up a little as I put my hand on her back. \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d</p><p>She draws away, looking me in the eyes and nodding. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s wasted,\u201d Seth explains as he pushes through the last of the crowd and joins us in the entrance, shoving up the sleeves of his black, button-down jacket. \u201cAnd I mean fucking trashed.\u201d</p><p>Keeping my hand on her back, Callie rests her face on my chest. \u201cI thought she didn\u2019t drink that much?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s distracted by a guy in the corner of the room, who is sipping a drink and talking to a girl with really short auburn hair. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t, but tonight she did. Look, can you watch her for just a little bit? There\u2019s someone I need to talk to.\u201d</p><p>I nod, tracing my fingers down her back. \u201cSure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMake sure to keep your hands to yourself,\u201d he warns, backing away with his finger pointed at me. \u201cShe\u2019s drunk enough that she won\u2019t remember a thing, which makes any touching on your part wrong.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head at him. \u201cWhat kind of a guy do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs with judgment in his eyes. \u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>Callie blinks up at me with hardly any awareness on her face. \u201cWho are the girls you\u2019re here with?\u201d</p> <p>The blond standing to my right shoots me a dirty look and puts her hands on her hips.</p><p>I keep my eyes on Callie. \u201cHey, let\u2019s go into the kitchen and get you some water.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head up and down. \u201cI am really thirsty.\u201d</p><p>The innocence in her eyes and the way she clings onto my shirt as I guide her toward the kitchen makes me uneasy. She trusts me at the moment and I\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to fuck it up, like I always do.</p><p>Ben is in the kitchen talking to a girl with long, curly brown hair, a tight pair of jeans, and a low cut red top. When he sees us, a curious expression crosses his face.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d he asks me, nodding his chin at Callie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Callie Lawrence.\u201d I move my arm away from her to grab a plastic cup off the top of the stack on the counter. \u201cShe goes to school here. Her dad was actually my coach back in high school.\u201d</p><p>Callie lets go of my waist. With her hands out to the side of her, she attempts to control her balance as I turn the faucet on to fill up the cup.</p><p>\u201cSo, your father is a coach?\u201d Ben leans back against the counter as the girl he was talking to wanders over to the bar to fill up a glass.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s been one for like twenty years or something,\u201d Callie says with a slight slur to her speech.</p><p>\u201cDid he teach you stuff?\u201d Ben asks, crossing his arms. I don\u2019t like the teasing tone in his voice. \u201cLike what the plays are or how to throw and catch a ball?\u201d</p> <p>I turn around with a glass of water in my hand as Callie rolls her eyes at him. \u201cObviously, like I know that you\u2019re the receiver.\u201d She blinks her eyes, mockingly. \u201cWhich means you catch the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you just adorable.\u201d Ben takes a step toward her with a look of fascination on his face.</p><p>My hand goes up against his chest to push him back. \u201cNo way. She\u2019s off limits.\u201d</p><p>Ben looks at me apologetically as I hand the glass of water to Callie and she tips her head back, downing it. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize you were dating her.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t bother to correct him, for many reasons, some of which are really fucked up. When he leaves the kitchen, Callie moves the cup away from her mouth and licks the water off her lips, making me think dirty thoughts I know I can\u2019t act on.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of an asshole,\u201d she says, handing the cup back to me.</p><p>I crush it and toss it in the trashcan. \u201cAnd you\u2019re kind of feisty when you\u2019re this drunk.\u201d</p><p>When I face her again, she\u2019s chewing on her bottom lip with her gaze boring into me. \u201cDo you like that I\u2019m feisty? Does it make you want me?\u201d</p> <p>Oh, fucking shit. She is wasted. \u201cHow about we get you home?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head, backing toward the counter with unsteady legs. Gripping the edge, she hops onto it and bumps her head on the cupboard. \u201cI want to know.\u201d She rubs her head, shooting a dirty look at the cupboard like it did something wrong. \u201cWhen I\u2019m like this, does it make you want me?\u201d</p><p>I glance over my shoulder, praying to God Seth will walk in here and save me from this uncomfortable conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Callie.\u201d</p><p>She pouts out her bottom lip. \u201cIt\u2019s because you don\u2019t want me at all, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Sighing, I put my hands down on the counter so she\u2019s in between my arms. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. Trust me. It\u2019s just that I don\u2019t want to have this conversation with you when you\u2019re not going to remember it.\u201d</p><p>She leans forward, reducing the gap between our faces. \u201cI\u2019ll remember it. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh at her, clenching my hands into fists to resist the urge to slide them onto her hips. \u201cAlright you want the truth?\u201d I ask and she bobs her head up and down. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t like you better this way. I like the sober Callie, the one that I can talk to. The one that is so sweet it\u2019s fucking adorable.\u201d I dip my face forward and breathe on her neck, moving toward the no touching line, but not crossing it. \u201cThe one that trembles just from the feel of my breath. The one that I want to kiss and touch so fucking badly it drives me crazy. The one that makes me feel things...\u201d I trail off and incline away, glad to see that her eyelids are only half open. That way I know I\u2019m still safe.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d She yawns, stretching her arms above her and I catch a glimpse of her bare stomach; flat, tiny, and firm. \u201cCan you find Seth so he can take me home?\u201d</p><p>I tuck a strand of her hair behind her ear. \u201cYeah, you come with me, though. I don\u2019t want to leave you here alone.\u201d</p><p>She nods, hopping off the counter, and I drape my arm around her back to hold her steady. We search the house, but Seth isn\u2019t anywhere. I find Luke at the poker table, playing a hand, cheating just like his father taught him.</p><p>\u201cHey, man, I\u2019m going to take Callie home,\u201d I say as he glances up at me from his cards. \u201cIf you see Seth, would you tell him?\u201d</p><p>Luke nods and then his eyes dash to the red and blue chips in front of him. \u201cYeah, man will do.\u201d</p><p>Callie buries her face into my shirt as we walk out the door and into the quiet hallway. She leans her weight on me and I guide her down the stairs and out the doors. The air is chilly and she shivers against me.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your jacket?\u201d I ask, rubbing my hand up and down her arm.</p><p>She shrugs as she stumbles over the curb and I catch her with my arm. Her eyes are barely open and she keeps sighing. Finally, I give up and stop in the middle of the sidewalk.</p><p>She blinks up at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I let go of her and speak slow because I know she\u2019s struggling to comprehend anything that\u2019s going on. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick you up and carry you back. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>She eyes my hands and then reverts her gaze to me. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I step cautiously toward her. \u201cPut your arms around my neck.\u201d</p><p>She obeys, sliding her hands up my chest and hooking them around my neck. She rests her head against my chest as I wrap my arm around her back. Bending my knees, I put my other arm underneath her legs and scoop her up into my arms. She nuzzles her face into my chest as I start up the sidewalk. I take my time because I love how it feels to carry her, the way she needs me, the way I need to protect her.</p><p>By the time I reach the McIntyre residence hall, I\u2019m working really hard not to panic that I have to put her down. \u201cCallie, where\u2019s your ID card?\u201d I ask. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my pocket,\u201d she murmurs, reaching for it, but her arm falls slack to her side. \u201cI\u2019m too tired to get it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry again, okay?\u201d I practically beg by she\u2019s nonresponsive.</p><p>Emptying my mind of any potential dirty thoughts, I brace her against my chest and slip my fingers into her pocket, quickly pulling her card out. Swiping it through the lock, the door unlocks and I get us inside. I take the elevators to the upper floor and find her room. When I extend my hand for the doorknob, she wakes up and grabs a hold of my arm.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t open it,\u201d she says, nodding at the red scarf tied around the doorknob. \u201cThat means my roommate is... she\u2019s... preoccupied.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh at the fact that even when she\u2019s drunk, she has a hard time saying it. \u201cWhere do you want me to take you?\u201d</p><p>She drops her head back against my chest. \u201cYou can just keep carrying me. It\u2019s very relaxing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Seth\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>Her eyelids are shut and her warm breath flows through my shirt. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to go get him...\u201d</p><p>My shoulders slump as I shift her body inward toward my chest and start down the hall to my right. When I step outside, I walk across the grass to the Downy building and take the elevator to my room.</p><p>\u201cCallie, I have to set you down while I get the door open,\u201d I whisper in her ear.</p><p>She nods and I carefully lower her feet to the ground. She leans back against the wall, her eyelids closing. I tap my fingers against the lock, pushing the code, and then shove the door open. Flipping the lights on, I step back and pick her up, carrying her inside. Kneeling down on the bed, I lower her onto the mattress, gently setting her down. She rolls to her side as I stand back up and figure out what I\u2019m going to do. I could sleep in Luke\u2019s bed, but he\u2019ll chew my ass out when he shows up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going to sleep?\u201d She eyes me as I kick off my boots into a corner.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I was trying to figure out.\u201d I stare at her with hesitance. \u201cIs it okay if I lay down by you?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes enlarge a little and hesitantly, she wiggles her body, scooting over toward the wall. I lay down on my side, keeping space between us as her eyelids close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never shared a bed with anyone besides Seth,\u201d she mutters. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep when I\u2019m lying by someone else.\u201d</p><p>I start to roll out of the bed. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll go find somewhere else to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers wrap around my arm. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go anywhere. I feel safe with you.\u201d</p><p>I pause. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you make it seem like everything he did doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She yawns and inches a little closer to me, tucking her hands under her cheek and curling her knees up. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>My hand shakes a little as I reach out and smooth her hair back from her forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She nods her head and seconds later, the sound of her soft breathing surrounds me. Without even thinking, I lean over and gently kiss her forehead, wondering what the hell I\u2019m going to do when morning rolls around.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>#12 See How Far You Can Go With Something You\u2019re Afraid Of</p><p>Callie</p><p>When I open my eyes, my skull feels like it\u2019s cracked and my brain is throbbing. I\u2019m aware right away that I\u2019m not in my room. There are guy\u2019s clothes all over the floor, a Play Station on a shelf near a flat screen television, and the blankets pulled over me smell like the cologne Kayden wears.</p><p>My eyes widen as I sit up in the bed, racking my brain for details of what happened last night. I remember Seth asking me what I wanted to do and I told him I wanted to have fun. So he took me out and we ended up getting drunk. After that, everything becomes hazy, but for some reason I can picture staring up at the stars while someone carries me.</p><p>The door to my right squeaks as Kayden enters the room holding two coffee cups. He\u2019s wearing a hooded black thermal shirt that shows off his lean arms and his jeans hang at his hips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He does a double take when he sees that I\u2019m awake. \u201cFor a while, I thought you were going to sleep all day.\u201d</p><p>Sunlight flickers through the window as I glance at the clock hanging on the wall above the bed. \u201cHoly crap, it\u2019s almost dinnertime?\u201d The thought of food squeezes at my stomach.</p><p>He hands me a coffee and I gladly take it. \u201cSeth told me that you love lattes.\u201d</p><p>I nod, taking a swallow. It tastes divine. \u201cGod, my head hurts so badly.\u201d</p> <p>He balances the other cup on the nightstand. \u201cThat usually happens when you drink too much.\u201d</p><p>I lower the cup away from my face. \u201cKayden... I can\u2019t... I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p><p>He sits down on the bed beside me and the mattress concaves under his weight. \u201cWell, I only got the privilege of witnessing the last half of the night, but from what I heard, Seth said you drank a ton of vodka. By the time I met up with you at Ben\u2019s party, you were trashed.\u201d</p><p>I wince. \u201cDid I do anything... weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. You had to sleep here because I lost track of Seth and there was a red scarf on your door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you sleep?\u201d</p><p>He tenses, looking guilty. \u201cNext to you.\u201d</p><p>I lick the froth from my lips and stare out the window at the clear blue sky. \u201cIf I remember right, you had to carry me?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou could barely walk... I didn\u2019t mind doing it, though.\u201d</p><p>I pull the blanket off my body and slide my feet over the edge of the bed. \u201cI should probably go take a shower and try to eat. Although, I feel like puking my guts out.\u201d</p><p>He places a hand on my leg, enfolding his fingers around my knee. \u201cI actually want you to come somewhere with me. There\u2019s something really important I need to tell you... It\u2019s about what happened that night at the pool house.\u201d There\u2019s heaviness in his eyes and stiffness in his voice.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cDo I have to go with you now? Or can I shower first? I feel really gross.\u201d</p><p>He laughs at me. \u201cYou can shower first. I\u2019ll wait for you out on the benches.\u201d</p><p>I get to my feet with a sudden urge to hug him. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll make it quick.\u201d I head for the door, but pause as I turn the knob. \u201cKayden, thank you for taking care of me last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d He hesitates. \u201cI owe you a lot more nights of that before we\u2019ll ever be even.\u201d</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I hardly slept last night. I lay in bed, listening to Callie breathe, trying to match my own breathing to the rhythm. Part of me wished she\u2019d just stay asleep, so I could continue to lie next to her.</p><p>By the time the sun rose above the mountains, I decided it was time to tell her the truth, so she knew what she was getting into. Then she can decide if she really wants me, because I can\u2019t seem to stay away from her.</p><p>I\u2019m nervous as fucking hell as I drive up the mountain where we took our first hike together. I park the truck near the tree line and we hop out, walking below the blue sky toward the hills.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really going to climb up there again?\u201d she asks, staring up at the top of the cliff as we approach it. Her hair is scattered across her back and her arms are crossed over her chest.</p><p>I mount onto a boulder that\u2019s on the side of the path and gaze out at the view. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet today.\u201d I sit down on the rock and pat the spot next to me. \u201cCome sit down by me.\u201d</p><p>She shuffles toward me and I offer her my hand to pull her up. She situates beside me, rests back on her palms, and gazes out at the hills in front of us. I shut my eyes for a moment, feeling everything, knowing it\u2019s going to go either good or bad when I tell her.</p><p>\u201cThat night you showed up and my father was beating my ass,\u201d I start before I can back out, \u201cwasn\u2019t the first time that he hit me.\"</p><p>She doesn\u2019t act surprised. \u201cHow many times has he hit you?\u201d</p><p>I watch a leaf float in front of us, drifting up and down, before blowing out across the spacious land. \u201cI don\u2019t know... I lost track around the age of seven or something.\u201d</p><p>She sucks in a sharp breath and her head angles to the side so she\u2019s looking at me. \u201cHe hit you like that when you were little?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, like it\u2019s no big deal. \u201cIt\u2019s just something he did, you know? More when he was drunk, although he did do it when he was sober. He didn\u2019t like things that we did and instead of grounding us or taking away our toys, he would hit and yell at us.\u201d</p><p>She stays silent for a long time as she studies the clouds in the sky. \u201cWhat did you do to make him mad that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hurt my hand.\u201d I flex my fingers out in front of me, not telling her that I did it on purpose. I\u2019m not ready for that. \u201cHe was worried I was going to ruin my football career.\u201d</p><p>She grows quiet again. \u201cWhy did you never do anything about it? Tell someone? Or fight back?\u201d</p><p>And there it is. What I was waiting for. She\u2019s realizing how fucked up the situation is. \u201cI don\u2019t know. At first I guess it was because I was too young to understand and by the time I got old enough to do something about it, I just didn\u2019t care. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019ve died inside.\u201d I shrug and then shrug again, forcing myself to look at her.</p><p>She arches her eyebrows at me, confounded, but there\u2019s no judgment in her eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t care that he hit you?\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes and inhale the cool air. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you this. I just don\u2019t do feelings very well and I\u2019m probably going to shut down and do a lot of fucked up things. You need to just stay away from me.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s silent and I open my eyelids, half expecting her to be gone, but she\u2019s watching me, her chest rising and falling with her breathing. She stares at me and then shifts her weight, scooting toward me and I tense. Kneeling up, she hitches her leg over my lap and encloses her arms around my neck, resting her head against my shoulder. She hugs me tightly and my eyes widen, my whole body constricting as I try to keep my hands off her, not knowing what to do or how to react. After a while her scent and warmth get to me and my hands slide up to the bottom of her back. Shutting my eyes, I hug her back with everything I have in me.</p><p>Callie</p><p>There is something about someone trusting you enough with their secrets that it makes it easier to trust them. It\u2019s like they\u2019re opening their heart and in return yours should open up to them, too.</p><p>Kayden opened up to me and I wanted to open up back, but I couldn\u2019t. Not completely anyway. I want to. I want him so much that I don\u2019t know what to do with myself.</p><p>I want him. I want him. I want him.</p><p>No matter how many times I write it, it still doesn\u2019t feel real. None of this does, because I never believed it would happen.</p><p>Someone knocks on my door and I climb off the bed to answer it. Kayden is on the other side with a football cradled under his arm. Instead of wearing his uniform, he\u2019s dressed in a nice pair of jeans and a grey t-shirt. His brown hair flips up beneath a black baseball hat.</p><p>\u201cI have a favor to ask you.\u201d It\u2019s been a couple of weeks since he told me about his father and we\u2019ve hung out a lot as friends, but there\u2019s something in his eyes tonight that\u2019s different, lighter.</p><p>\u201cOkay...\u201d I back away from the doorway and let him in. His eyes instantly go to the open notebook on my bed. I lunge for it and tuck it under my pillow.</p><p>\u201cWas that the journal?\u201d He grins as he switches the balls position to beneath his other arm.</p><p>\u201cCan you pretend you didn\u2019t see that?\u201d I put my hands out in front of me, overlapping my fingers. \u201cPretty please.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cIs there stuff in it about me?\u201d</p><p>I pretend to itch my eye to conceal the blood rushing to my cheeks. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie, you\u2019re blushing,\u201d he teases, taking a step forward so he can withdraw my hand from my face. \u201cDon\u2019t hide it. It\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, more at myself, because his comment only makes my cheeks heat more. \u201cSo what\u2019s the favor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to come help me practice.\u201d He wanders around the room, taking in everything, passing the ball back and forth between his hands. \u201cLuke\u2019s busy with some girl he\u2019s been dating for a week and he won\u2019t come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d I say. \u201cBut you don\u2019t look dressed for practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be a mild practice.\u201d He faces me. \u201cJust a little throwing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think I can help you?\u201d I question, my gaze scaling up his very sturdy body.</p><p>\u201cI saw you at the store. It looked like you were more than capable. Besides, you were bragging to Ben at that party about how awesome your football knowledge is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not. Did I?\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>It makes me wonder what else I said. Sometimes it feels like I said stuff to him that he keeps from me.</p><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d I grab my keys from my desk and slip my feet into my converses. \u201cI will do my best to challenge you.\u201d</p><p>He chuckles under his breath as he turns for the door and I wonder if he\u2019s thinking about the night we kissed like I am.</p><p>When we get to the stadium, the lights are shining down across the green field. The bleachers are empty and the only sign of anyone is the janitor out front emptying the garbage cans.</p><p>We walk into the center of the field and I spin in a circle, looking at all the bleachers, feeling small because of the massive size of my surroundings. The sky is dark, the stars are out, and the moon orbs fully.</p><p>Kayden tosses the football up in the air as I button up my jacket. \u201cYou know, ever since that day at the store, I\u2019ve been really curious to see you throw again. I\u2019m wondering if it was a fluke.\u201d</p><p>I position my hands on my hips and target a glare in his direction. \u201cHey, what\u2019s with the insulting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get you worked up.\u201d He starts to run backwards with the ball in his hand. \u201cIt\u2019ll make you play better.\u201d He launches the ball at me and I catch it, wincing when the leather scrapes my palms.</p><p>\u201cThat stung.\u201d I pretend to be hurt, cradling my wrist.</p><p>His arms fall to his side and he strides toward me. \u201cCallie, I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d</p><p>I fling back my arm and throw the football as hard as I can in his direction. He runs backward, jumping just in time to catch it.</p><p>When his feet touch the grass again, he shakes his head. \u201cYou play dirty.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, not arguing. \u201cIt was how I was taught. My dad takes the game very seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know that. Do you know how many times he chewed my ass off for messing up? It was a good thing, though.\u201d He throws the football to my side and I have to move quickly to catch it. \u201cHe kept me on my toes and pushed me. If it wasn\u2019t for him, I probably would have never gotten the scholarship.\u201d</p><p>I hold the football in my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t want this to come out rude, but couldn\u2019t your family afford to pay for your tuition if you wouldn\u2019t have received the scholarship?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy dad wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he says, swallowing hard. \u201cHe used to tell us all the time, either we found our own way out of the house, or we\u2019d be stuck there... I didn\u2019t want to be stuck there.\u201d I start to open my mouth, but he claps his hands and then holds them out in front of him. \u201cHere, throw it to me.\u201d</p><p>I toss it back to him and he catches it easily with a grin on his face. \u201cAlright, this time I\u2019m going to throw it to you and then try to tackle you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widen as my jaw drops. \u201cAre you being serious?\u201d</p><p>He chucks it high up in the air. \u201cI never kid about football. So, go long. It\u2019ll give you more of a chance to outrun me.\u201d</p> <p>I back down the field, still doubting he\u2019ll actually chase me and tackle me to the ground. When I\u2019m fairly close to the touchdown zone, I stop and face him. \u201cAre you really going to chase me down? Or, are you just trying to make me play better?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s a ways away, but the deviousness masking his expression is evident. \u201cTrust me, I\u2019m not joking. In fact, I\u2019m kind of looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>My heart skips at the gruffness of his voice. \u201cFine, throw the ball, but I\u2019m going to win.\u201d</p><p>He looks momentarily stunned, but then he backs up, his feet picking up momentum, before his arm swings forward and the ball spirals through the air toward me. My feet move quickly as I sprint backwards with my hands up in the air. At the last second, I give a little jump, and snag the ball in midair. When my feet touch the grass, I hesitate, still unsure if he\u2019s going to chase me down.</p><p>As soon as I\u2019m steady, he runs at me, like really runs. I whirl around on my toes and take off down the field. Thankfully, I\u2019m close because there\u2019s no way my tiny legs are going to be able to outrun his long ones for very long.</p> <p>He\u2019s laughing as he chases me and his heavy footsteps are approaching rapidly. My eyes zone in on the yellow poles at the end and the white line I need to make it over. When my foot crosses it, I spin around with my arms above my head.</p><p>Kayden slows to a jog, shaking his head and panting. \u201cOkay, I think I might have underestimated you and given you too much of a head start.\u201d</p><p>A grin spreads across my face as I throw the football at the grass. \u201cWhat is it you guys do when you get a touchdown?\u201d I put my finger to my chin, pretending to think deeply. \u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I skip backwards, waving my hands in front of me, doing a silly little dance.</p><p>He laughs, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \u201cWow, you have a cocky streak in you.\u201d</p><p>I pick up the football, grab the pole with my free hand, and spin around it, feeling alive and weightless. For a second, I shut my eyes and enjoy the cool breeze against my cheeks, owning the moment. When I open my eyelids again, Kayden is walking toward me, taking leisurely strides with his hands tucked into his pockets.</p><p>I slow down, still holding onto the pole, watching him narrow the distance. He doesn\u2019t say a word, his emerald eyes fastened on me with confusion and intensity in them. As he reaches me, I lean against the pole, fighting to keep my breathing steady against the desire flowing off him.</p> <p>He takes the ball out of my hand and throws it over his shoulder toward the end of the field. \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of that stupid thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that\u2019s why you brought me here?\u201d I say with an uneven voice, unable to take my eyes off his lips as he licks them. \u201cTo help you practice.\u201d</p><p>His lips part, like he\u2019s going to say something, but then he presses them together and rotates his hat backwards so the visor is behind his head. Inclining his body toward me, my back brushes the pole as his lips hover above mine. He deliberates, putting his hand on the pole next to my head, and then he kisses me.</p><p>It starts off soft, a light brush of our lips, but then his other hand grabs the pole and his body moves in until it presses against mine. Our legs tangle, our chests collide, and the tip of his tongue runs along my lips until I open my mouth and let him in.</p><p>A breathy noise escapes the back of my throat and at first I\u2019m mortified, but it seems to encourage him. Desire and heat radiates through the entwining of our tongues. One of his hands grips my waist, just beneath the bottom of my shirt and my nerves jumble. His other hand travels down my side, his thumb tracing my ribs, before resting on my hip. Tightening his fingers around me, he lifts me up. Gasping, I hook my legs around his waist in a vice-grip.</p><p>My mind is flying about a million miles an hour. I\u2019m afraid. Not of him, but everything connected to what he\u2019s doing. Do I want this? Do I? The answer is yes. I want it. Badly.</p><p>I hope he doesn\u2019t notice the anxious tremble of my body as his fingers slip underneath my shirt and he sketches his fingertips along my stomach. As he nips at my bottom lip, I let out an uncontrollable whimper.</p><p>He draws back, putting a sliver of space between our faces. His pupils are huge and shiny beneath the stadium lights and his untamed breath caresses against my cheek.</p> <p>\u201cCallie, I don\u2019t want to...\u201d He pauses, tucking a strand of my hair behind my ear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to push you.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s like he can read my inexperience all over my face. I bite down on my lip, working to hide my embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>He wavers. \u201cAre you... are you sure?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head swiftly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Without any more reluctance he crashes his lips against mine and a gasp falters from my throat at the heat his kiss brings to my body. His tongue enters my mouth again as his hands stay under my shirt, his palms touching my stomach. It\u2019s the most frightening and most wonderful experience of my life. I don\u2019t ever want to forget it.</p><p>Daringly, I slip my hands underneath his shirt as I breathe ravenously. He winces as my hands wander along his well-defined abs covered with the bumpy lines of his scars.</p><p>I worry he\u2019s going to reach up and tug my hands out of his shirt, but instead his hand explores higher up to the edge of my bra. His lips leave mine and touch the corner of my mouth, trailing kisses down my cheek, along my jawline, to the side of my neck where my pulse is racing. My head falls to the side uncontrollably as his palm moves over my breast just outside of my bra. Sucking in a deep breath, I wait for it to catch up with me, but all I can think about is him exploring my body more. I want to find out what it\u2019s like to be touched by someone I trust; by someone I give my permission to.</p><p>His fingers start to move below my bra and my insides quiver as he strokes his thumb across my nipple. Heat blazes through my body and I grab onto his sides, grasping onto him with everything in me; feeling his scars, while he feels mine.</p><p>He lets out a groan as he sucks on the bottom of my neck and my body curves into his. \u201cCallie,\u201d he whispers. \u201cIf you want me to stop, just tell me.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want him to stop. At all. It feels too good. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a deafening click and within seconds, every light flips off and darkness smothers us. I freeze, grabbing onto Kayden, as he pulls his mouth away from my neck. I feel his chest heaving where my fingers hold onto him and for a moment, we\u2019re silent.</p><p>Then, Kayden starts to laugh. \u201cWell, this is fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you see anything?\u201d I whisper, turning my head and squinting.</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>He removes his hand from my breast and I think he\u2019s going to put me down, but instead he wraps his arms around my lower back, interlocking his fingers to hold up my weight. He walks through the dark, carrying me, and I tighten my legs around him, wishing I could see his face, because I want to know what he\u2019s thinking.</p><p>His shoes scuff the grass and then we move up onto concrete. Seconds later, we exit out of a tunnel and into the parking lot, which is mostly vacant except for a few cars along the back row, which is lit up by lampposts.</p><p>The brightness stings at my eyes. \u201cWhy did that happen?\u201d</p><p>His emerald eyes sparkle as he shrugs his shoulders. \u201cI wonder if that was by accident, or if it was done intentionally to get us off the field?\u201d</p><p>I adjust my hands a little so my arms are looped around the back of his neck. \u201cWere you not supposed to be playing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, no.\u201d His smile grows like he\u2019s enjoying the moment. \u201cBut I\u2019m extremely glad I did.\u201d</p><p>I let my head fall forward into his shoulder, breathing in his scent. \u201cNow what do we do?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a while and I finally lean back to look him in the eyes. He appears conflicted by something and then he sets me down on the ground, lacing his fingers through mine.</p><p>\u201cShould we see where the wind takes us?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I stare at my hand in his and then look up at him. \u201cThat sounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>#9 Dance in the Rain</p><p>#13 Live in the Moment</p><p>#17 Be Yourself</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I\u2019ll admit it. I had the whole thing planned and it ended up going where I hoped it would go. Ever since I told Callie about my father, we\u2019d been getting close as friends. Which was fine, except I\u2019m extremely fucking attracted to her, a revelation that came to me during an intense moment in the library.</p><p>She\u2019d been helping me study for an English exam and when she showed up, she\u2019d had a jacket on. As she was reading me some of her notes, she took off the jacket. Underneath it, she had on a white t-shirt and I could see the outline of her bra through it and her nipples poking up through the fabric. She probably didn\u2019t realize it because she is not the kind of girl that would do that on purpose. In fact, if I pointed it out to her, her cheeks would get red and she\u2019d run off.</p><p>\u201cKayden?\u201d she asked, looking at me perplexedly. \u201cAre you listening? You kind of look like you\u2019re spacing off.\u201d</p><p>I was leaning back in the chair with my arm on the table and a pen in my mouth as I chewed on the end. \u201cI kind of was.\u201d</p><p>She let out an exhausted sigh. \u201cDo you want me to read it again?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head, barely paying attention. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She started reading from the book and my mind went back to dirty thoughts of what it would be like to touch her all over and make her moan underneath me as I rocked into her. I wondered if she\u2019d let me if I tried. The friend\u2019s thing seemed to be working for us. She made me laugh and smile and I was enjoying myself. My dark thoughts and problems had been contained more than they had in a long time.</p><p>It seemed like I should just let things be, but the more I watched her lips read the words from the book, the more I wanted to bite on them.</p><p>Her eyes rose up from the book and she was trying to look angry. \u201cYou\u2019re not listening to me, are you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, unable to stop myself from grinning at her. \u201cNot really. Sorry. I\u2019m kind of distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d she asks with uncertainty. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d</p><p>It took a lot not to smile and whisper in her ear every single detail about the very vivid images running through my mind. \u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. Trust me. You probably don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d</p><p>Her forehead wrinkled as she tried to figure out why I was so happy. \u201cDo you need a break?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNah, you can keep reading. I\u2019m enjoying the sound of your voice.\u201d</p><p>She sucked her bottom lip in to stifle a smile and that nearly threw me over the edge. I decided that I needed to be with her just a little bit more so I conjured up my lovely football plan.</p><p>After the lights shut off at the field, we end up back at my room. I\u2019m surprised how willingly she went with me. I almost backed out a few times on our way there, when my emotions were getting a little too intense for me.</p><p>She walks around the small space in between the beds, glancing at my stuff, and picks up a DVD case, reading the back. \u201cYou recorded all your games?\u201d</p> <p>I pull a face as I take my hat off and toss it onto the bed. \u201cNo, my dad did. He liked to make me watch it afterward, so he could point out everything I did wrong.\u201d</p><p>She sets down the case and turns to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, raking my fingers through my hair. \u201cFor talking about this stuff with you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes fix on me as she inches toward me. \u201cI want you to talk to me about it. I would have never asked you questions if I didn\u2019t want to hear the answers... I can\u2019t just forget what I saw that night. I don\u2019t think I ever will.\u201d</p><p>I remember the night she was drunk and how she muttered about a guy doing something to her. \u201cYou can tell me stuff too, if you want. I\u2019m a great listener.\u201d</p> <p>She turns her face toward the window, her chest rising and falling. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m surprised at how much warmer it is here than back at home.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s hiding something. I decrease the gap between us and her shoulders tense. I start to open my mouth to press her, but she tilts her head toward me with a strange look on her face, like she\u2019s scared out of her mind. Before I can even register what she\u2019s doing, she leans in and seals her lips to mine. Her body trembles as she grips at the bottom of my shirt, waiting for me to kiss her back.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t planning on taking it any further tonight, but the feel of her lips is overwhelming. Without even thinking, my mouth opens and my tongue enters hers, devouring her.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d she moans as my hands slide around to her back and I pull her closer, moving my lips deliberately against hers. I\u2019m savoring every inch, every spot, memorizing it.</p><p>Suddenly the intense kiss shifts to desperation. I spin us around and back us toward the bed, my feet getting entangled with hers. My hand snaps out to catch us as we fall onto the mattress. Rolling her onto her back, I hold up my weight with my arms, but allow enough closeness that her heat radiates into me and her breasts brush my chest every time she breathes.</p><p>I loosen up a little and start to explore her body with my hands, feeling the soft skin of her stomach, her ribs, the bottom of her breast. Before I know what I\u2019m doing, I have my hand underneath her bra again. I stroke my finger across her nipple and she gasps as her legs constrict around my midsection. It feels good\u2014way too good. I need to stop, otherwise it\u2019s going to break apart on me.</p> <p>I start to revolve to the side, but her body follows mine and her leg hitches around my hip, so my thigh is pressing between her legs. As my fingers dig into her waist, her body bows forward and she rubs herself along my thigh. Her head falls back as her glazed eyes open and she begins to quiver.</p><p>Fuck. I\u2019ve never been so turned on before. I begin moving my leg against her and lean forward to grab her lip between my teeth, nipping it softly as I cup her breast with my hand. Clutching onto my shoulders, her entire body shakes with her nerves.</p><p>Should I stop? It\u2019s pretty clear she\u2019s never gone this far before and I don\u2019t want to be the one responsible for pushing her where she\u2019s not ready to go.</p><p>\u201cCallie,\u201d I say, but her fingers tighten around my shoulder blades, her nails piercing my skin through the fabric of my shirt as she lets out a moan and I know she\u2019s close. I put my hand between her legs and rub her the rest of the way, her body bucking against my hand.</p><p>Moments later, she blinks her eyes as her body relaxes. I watch her in complete awe as she works to reclaim control of her thoughts. As she settles down, her whole face sinks and my chest tightens as she stares over my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHey?\u201d I graze my finger along the small birthmark on the side of her eye. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She blinks at me and I can tell she\u2019s trying not to cry. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She squirms out of my arms and starts to climb over me. \u201cCan you just give me a few moments?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m worried. The sadness that washed away from her eyes momentarily has returned and is magnified. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to...\u201d She trails off as she stands up and pulls her bra and shirt back into place.</p><p>I sit up, reaching for her arm. \u201cCallie, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>She throws the door open and runs out without so much as an explanation.</p><p>\u201cGod, dammit.\u201d I flop down on the bed, dragging my fingers across my face. Usually, I\u2019m the one who bails out of these kinds of situations, which makes me wonder what she\u2019s running from.</p><p>Callie</p><p>I have no idea what just happened. Well, actually I do. I had my first orgasm, simply by rubbing up against Kayden\u2019s leg and then he finished it off with his hand. It felt so good, my mind could scarcely comprehend anything else, but when it\u2019s over, everything piles on my shoulders like cracked bricks. Suddenly, I see his face instead of Kayden\u2019s.</p><p>He\u2019s looking at me with concern as I jump off the bed and race out of the room. Once I\u2019m in the bathroom, I lock the door and collapse onto my knees in front of the toilet. I lift the lid, feeling the pain burn in my stomach. I want it out. So badly. I drop my head down, jab my finger down my throat, and with a sharp shove, I force everything to exit my body. My shoulders jerk as I hack on my finger and the vomit tears at my throat. My eyes water and my nostrils burn as I lean away and take my finger out of my mouth. The tip has a little blood on it and I wipe it off on a piece of toilet paper.</p><p>I rest my back against the cold tile wall and my head falls back. Hot tears spill out of my eyes and stream down my cheeks as I smear the vomit and sweat off my face with the sleeve of my shirt, my chest twitching fitfully as I work to breathe.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be this way,\u201d I whisper as my eyes fill up with tears. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be this way.\u201d I yank at my hair and scream through my teeth, fucking hating the guy who did this to me with every single ounce of strength that I own. \u201cI fucking hate you. I fucking hate you... I fucking...\u201d My cries overwhelm me and I surrender, bawling my eyes and heart out.</p><p>I can\u2019t stop thinking about Kayden and the way it felt when he touched me, how good it felt. I want to do it again. I just wish I could stop associating it with that one fucking time. That God damn time I wish I could forget.</p><p>I go back to the memory a thousand times, wishing I\u2019d be able to see what was going on beforehand. I really thought he just wanted to give me a birthday present.</p><p>I followed him down the hallway so easily and into my room, actually glancing around at my bed and floor, searching for the present.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d I had asked him, turning around.</p><p>He was locking the door. Why was he locking the door?</p><p>A week goes by and I avoid Kayden at all costs. I ignore his calls, skip out on the one class I have with him, and don\u2019t answer my door when he knocks. I feel bad, but I\u2019m too embarrassed to face him. I assumed after what happened he\u2019d just walk away, but it\u2019s not the case.</p><p>At the end of the week, I sneak off to the library when I know he\u2019s in Biology class to find some books for a paper I have to write about depression. The campus is fairly quiet since it\u2019s so close to the holidays. My mom and dad are flying out to Florida to see my grandparents for Thanksgiving, so I\u2019m not going home. I can\u2019t afford the plane ticket to fly there with them, either.</p><p>While I\u2019m searching a shelf, my phone buzzes in my pocket. \u201cHey, I thought you had class,\u201d I answer it.</p><p>Seth says, \u201cShouldn\u2019t I be saying the same thing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking a break today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA break from what, though?\u201d he asks with insinuation.</p><p>\u201cLife.\u201d I skim my fingers along the titles, feeling the worn spines of the books. \u201cBesides, I\u2019m using my time to catch up on assignments. By the sound of that music playing in the background, I\u2019m taking it that you\u2019re watching reruns of Pretty Little Liars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not planning on spending all day in my room,\u201d he argues. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m going to head out right now to see you. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>I sigh, standing up straight. \u201cI\u2019m in the library trying to find this damn book on depression. The catalogue said it was in, but it\u2019s totally not on the shelf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat section are you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the back corner, near the window that shows the stadium.\u201d I swallow the lump in my throat that forms when I think of Kayden.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be there for a while?\u201d he asks and the television shuts off. \u201cI\u2019m heading out now.\u201d</p><p>Standing on my tiptoes, I peer up at the top row of the shelf. \u201cProbably. I\u2019m too short to see the top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, Callie Girl, one knight in shining armor is on his way.\u201d He hangs up and I put my phone into my back pocket.</p><p>I search the nearby aisles for a stepstool I\u2019ve seen around a few times. Finally, I give up and go back to the spot. Propping my foot on the second shelf up, I check from left to right and climb up the shelf.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d I say and grab the book from the row. I hop down and sense someone move up beside me. When I glance up, suddenly Seth\u2019s little comment about a knight in shining armor makes sense. Kayden is in front of me, wearing jeans and a black hoodie, his brown hair disheveled.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d His shoulders are rigid and his voice is tight. \u201cYou\u2019ve been avoiding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I admit, fiddling with the corners of the pages. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. There was just some stuff going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be sorry, Callie.\u201d He rests his arm on one of the shelves and leans his weight against it. \u201cI\u2019d just liked to know what\u2019s going on... Did I... did I push you to do stuff?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNothing about any of this is your fault, I promise. I wanted to... everything that happened, I wanted.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders unstiffen. \u201cThen why did you run off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d I say, staring at the spot on the floor in front of my feet.</p><p>He angles his body forward and lowers his face to capture my gaze. \u201cYou could talk to me about it. Maybe I can help. I\u2019m pretty good at understanding complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anything that can be helped,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I\u2019ve got to work through.\u201d</p><p>He lets out a gradual breath. \u201cI completely understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry for freaking out on you. I shouldn\u2019t have just run off or avoided you for the last week. I just didn\u2019t know what to say and felt stupid. I\u2019ll try not to do it again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs there going to be another time for you to try to not do it again?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize what I was saying. \u201cI don\u2019t know. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles lowly. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been pretty clear on what I want. So it\u2019s really up to you. What do you want, Callie?\u201d</p><p>My eyes travel up his long legs, his tight chest, and land on his eyes that care about nothing more than to hear my answer. I want him. I want him. I\u2019ve scribbled it down in my journal many times because it\u2019s the truth.</p> <p>\u201cI want...\u201d I pause trying to figure out the best words. \u201cI want to spend more time with you.\u201d</p><p>His smile broadens and his posture loosens as he cracks his knuckles. \u201cYou were making me nervous there for a minute.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile at him. \u201cI was just trying to think of the right words.\u201d</p><p>His eyes move over my shoulder to the window where the sky is starting to turn pink as the sun descends below the hills. \u201cI have to be at the stadium in like five minutes, but can you do something for me?\u201d</p><p>I tuck the book under my arm. \u201cSure. What?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you come watch me play?\u201d he asks. \u201cI need someone to cheer me on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what cheerleaders are for?\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cCheerleaders are overrated.\u201d He reaches toward my face, hesitates, and then grazes the pad of his thumb along my bottom lip. \u201cBesides, I have a feeling you\u2019ll bring me a lot of luck.\u201d</p><p>I have to force my eyelids to stay open from his touch. \u201cAlright... I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>The sky is grey, the lights are bright on the green field, and the metal bench beneath my butt is colder than a freezer. There are clusters of people around me, yelling, laughing, and waving their hands in the air. It makes me antsy, but I work through it.</p><p>\u201cSo what is it with football that makes people crazy?\u201d Seth observes the field with wide eyes and then squints at the red digital timer on the board. \u201cI really don\u2019t get what the big deal is. I never have. I\u2019ve even been to games before\u2014watched... Braiden play\u2014But I still don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s fun to watch guys run around wearing tight pants,\u201d I suggest with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cYou know what? You just made an excellent point.\u201d His brown eyes sweep the field where the players are lined up as he tugs the hood of his jacket over his head.</p><p>Kayden is easy to spot because he\u2019s one of the tallest. Of course the \u201cOwens\u201d on the back of his brown and yellow jersey is kind of a dead giveaway, too. I think he\u2019s glanced up at me a few times, but it\u2019s hard to tell for sure.</p><p>Five minutes later Seth grows restless, tapping his fingers on his bouncing knee. \u201cI feel like I need to get up and dance or something. Liven up this party.\u201d</p><p>I motion my hand in the air. \u201cDance away.\u201d</p><p>He cocks his head to the side at the round man sitting next to him, wearing a beanie and a hooded sweatshirt, and stuffing his face with peanuts. \u201cI wonder what this guy would do if I did.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, tucking my hands between my legs. \u201cProbably throw those peanuts at you.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a face and then exaggeratedly rubs his belly. \u201cGood, I hope he does. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p> <p>I glance up at the timer. \u201cThere\u2019s only two more minutes left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd are we winning or losing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe score is twenty-eight to three.\u201d</p><p>He raises his hands to the side, aiming me a \u201cduh\u201d look. \u201cAnd who\u2019s twenty-eight?\u201d</p><p>I point at my chest. \u201cWe are. We\u2019re winning by a lot.\u201d</p><p>He bobs his head from side to side, eyeing the woman in front of us, inhaling a hamburger. \u201cGod, I\u2019m so hungry.\u201d</p><p>I sigh, pointing at the stairway. \u201cThen go get something to eat. There are some booths outside.\u201d</p><p>He stares at the stairs skeptically. \u201cWill you come with me? Sports people are intense.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I get to my feet and he follows me. I say excuse me at least ten times while I accidentally step on people\u2019s toes. When we are on the stairs, I let out a breath of relief at the open space and follow Seth as he trots down to the bottom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving, are you?\u201d I hear someone shout over the rustle of the crowd.</p><p>Kayden is standing at the sidelines, looking extremely sexy in his uniform, his emerald eyes locked on me.</p><p>I shake my head, wrapping my fingers around the cold railing, and lean over it. \u201cNo, Seth just needs to get something to eat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I don\u2019t want you to take your luck with you!\u201d he shouts with a wink and a smile.</p><p>I try not to let a big silly grin surface on my lips. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll be back!\u201d</p><p>Wait for me afterwards, he mouths, his lips moving slowly from beneath his helmet. Mesmerized, I nod and he turns back to his team with a spring in his walk.</p><p>I return my attention back to the aisle and almost run into Seth. \u201cI thought you kept walking.\u201d I brace myself against the railing and step back.</p><p>He gapes at me unfathomably. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d</p><p>I inch to the side out of a man\u2019s way. \u201cBelieve what?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head in awe. \u201cYou\u2019re in love with him.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes, almost laughing. \u201cI am not. Now can we please go get you something to eat before the game ends and we get taken out by the crowd.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, he backs toward the last flight of stairs, still thinking the same absurd thought, but he\u2019s wrong. I\u2019m not in love with Kayden. I barely know him and love requires a lot of time, a lot of trust, and a lot of other things I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>Seth leaves me in the tunnel, just outside the locker room. He has a date tonight with Greyson and he walks off toward his car with a skip in his walk. After the crowd clears, I sit down on the concrete and check my text messages.</p><p>Mom: Hey sweetie. I\u2019ve been trying to call you for the last few hours. I wanted to know if you were coming home for Thanksgiving. I know it\u2019s kind of late notice and I already told you we\u2019re going out of town, but our plans changed and we are going to be home. Call me.</p><p>I sigh at the thought of going home to the memories and the lies. I put my phone in the pocket of my jacket and direct my concentration to the side as rain begins to pour down from the sky and flood the sidewalks and streets. The streetlights flicker through the raindrops and I inhale in the scent, closing my eyes.</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking hell.\u201d Kayden\u2019s voice rises over the noise.</p><p>I open my eyes. He\u2019s standing just in front of me, dressed in a grey Henley, dark jeans, and boots. His hair is damp and his eyes are locked on the rain. I push to my feet and brush the dirt off the back of my jeans.</p><p>\u201cI was right about your luck,\u201d he says. \u201cWe totally kicked their asses.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI think that was all you guys. Not me.\u201d</p><p>His legs stretch toward me as he closes the space between us. \u201cNo way, that was all you. I played better than I ever have because I knew you were watching and I was trying to impress you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ve seen you play before, right?\u201d</p><p>He tilts his head to the side. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSometimes my dad would make me go with him to practice because my parents thought I needed to get out of the house more. I would hang out under the bleachers and watch.\u201d He looks at me sadly as I tuck my hands up in my sleeves and change the subject. \u201cWhat are we going to do about the rain? Luke didn\u2019t happen to drive, did he?\u201d</p><p>His eyes wander to the veil of rain pouring down from the roof. \u201cNo, we always walk over. I could go ask someone for a ride. I think a few people drove here.\u201d</p><p>I watch the rain splatter against the concrete, knowing if Seth were here he\u2019d make me go out there. \u201cThere\u2019s a thing on the list that says I have to dance in the rain.\u201d</p><p>Kayden\u2019s eyebrows furrow as he redirects his concentration back to me. \u201cYou want to go out there and dance?\u201d</p><p>I look at him, deciding. \u201cNo, but I think I\u2019m going to run home. I\u2019ll meet you back there.\u201d</p><p>Before he can respond, I run out of the tunnel, putting my arms over my head, shivering as the cold droplets soak through my jacket and drip down my face. Puddles splash underneath my shoes as I race down the sidewalk, feeling invigorated and alive. Thunder booms from the sky and the rain lashes down harder, but I let my hands fall to my side, letting go and being myself as I live in the moment.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I was pumped up the entire game. Something about Callie being up there, not judging me only being there for me, lightened the pressure my dad always put on me. She brought the fun back to it and I played better than I ever have.</p><p>After I change out of my uniform, I head out of the locker room. She\u2019s sitting on the ground with her face turned to the side and her eyes shut. I stare at her for a moment, taking in her parted lips, her long eyelashes that flutter every time the thunder snaps, and the way her chest moves as she breathes. I finally look over at the end of the tunnel and holy fuck, it\u2019s raining hard.</p><p>As I try to figure out a way to get us back to the dorms without getting drenched, she says something about dancing in the rain being on her list and then takes off into the rainstorm. I\u2019m stunned as she sprints down the sidewalk, splashing in the puddles with her hands out to the side like it\u2019s one of the best moments of her life.</p><p>\u201cFuck it.\u201d I take off after her. When the water hits my body it\u2019s like ice. It\u2019s hard to keep my eyes on Callie because the rain is so thick. I shield my face with my arm and keep my chin tucked down.</p><p>She slows down when she reaches the street to check for cars and I catch up with her, panting loudly.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d I ask as beads of water fly everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking colder than hell out here.\u201d</p><p>She jumps back, startled as rain streams down her body and her hair sticks to her cheeks and neck. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you followed me. You didn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>I lace my fingers through hers and we jog across the street, water soaking our clothes and dripping in our hair. I hold my arm above her head, protecting her from as much rain as possible. Cars zip up and down the street as we sprint up the sidewalk toward my dorm building. When we reach the trees in front of it, I guide her toward the side entrance, but she slips her hand from mine and jumps out from under the trees into the downpour of the rain.</p><p>\u201cCallie, what the hell are you doing?\u201d I call out as icy raindrops shower from the branches and down the back of my neck and face.</p><p>She closes her eyes and spreads her arms out to the side of her, tipping her head back as she spins in circles, and her wet clothes cling to her body. Rain pours down on her face and drips from her hair, which has slipped loose and hangs down her back. Her jacket falls from her shoulders and the water cascades down the bare skin of her arms.</p><p>I inch forward, unable to take my eyes off her. The way she moves, the way the rain covers her body\u2014I\u2019m enthralled by it. Ducking my head, I step out from the shelter of the tree and into the rain with her. I don\u2019t understand it, but I need to be near her. I\u2019ve never felt this way before and it\u2019s exhilarating and fucking terrifying because I\u2019ve never needed anything from anyone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I stop in front of her in the middle of the muddy grass and her eyelids lift open, her lashes fluttering against the raindrops. She starts to raise her head up, but I cup her face in between my hands, holding her in place. I tip my head forward and bring my mouth to hers. Sucking the rain from her bottom lip, I taste her slowly, feeling the warmth of her breath against my mouth.</p><p>\u201cKayden,\u201d she murmurs, shutting her eyes as her fingers travel up my back and knot through my hair.</p><p>I open my mouth and slip my tongue deep inside hers as my hand tangles through her wet hair. My other hand slides down her neck, leaving a hot trail as I feel my way along her wet clothes and body down to her hips. I scoop her up and she gasps as her legs latch around my waist. The heat of our bodies warms up the coldness from our wet clothes as we cling onto each other. Holding her tightly, I secure my arms underneath her ass and kiss her fiercely as the rain nearly drowns us. Heading across the grass, I crack my eyelids open every once in a while to make sure I\u2019m traveling in the right direction of my dorm building.</p><p>I luck out and someone is walking inside as we reach the entrance. I catch the door with my foot, before it closes, maneuver it open, and get us into the hallway without putting her down. There are people inside, watching us curiously, but I don\u2019t stop. This is one of those moments that it would nearly kill me if I pulled away.</p> <p>As my hands wander across her body, I feel everything. The way my heart jumps inside my chest, the way her hands in my hair make my breathing rapid, the excitement to get her in my room, the eagerness to touch more of her, to make her moan, the way she clings to me, trusting me, needing me.</p><p>No one has ever needed me before because I\u2019ve never let anyone that far in.</p><p>Callie</p><p>I\u2019m dancing in the rain, just like I\u2019m supposed to. It\u2019s cold, yet it feels wonderful because it was my choice. As I\u2019m spinning around in circles, Kayden walks up to me with fear and want in his eyes. The look scares me and excites me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for what waits on the other side of that look, but I want to find out.</p><p>He cups my wet cheeks and kisses me deliberately, like he\u2019s memorizing every second. It\u2019s the perfect kiss and I pretend it\u2019s my first, kissing him the way I want to.</p> <p>He picks me up, with his lips fastened to mine as he carries me toward his room. I grip onto him, telling myself that I can make it farther this time, that I just need to trust him.</p><p>He somehow gets the door to his room open without putting me down and he stumbles inside and shuts the door. Laughing against my lips, he kicks something out of the way and it hits the wall with a thud. I lower my feet to the floor as his hands sneak under my shirt and his palms are cold against my skin. I trace my fingers through his wet locks, down his broad shoulders and to the bottom of his shirt, along his lower abs.</p><p>He winces at my touch and I recoil my hand back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say.</p><p>He blinks at me and then reaching over his shoulder, he tugs his shirt over his head and discards it on the floor. I saw him with his shirt off once, at the pool house. This is different though. The light emphasizes every single white scar, small and big, on his lean chest, his arms, his firm stomach. Some are as tiny as my fingernail, some bigger, and there is one that tracks all the way down the front of him.</p><p>Impulsively, I lean forward, shut my eyes, and touch my lips to the middle of his chest above his heart, my breath feathering his skin.</p><p>\u201cCallie,\u201d he says as his muscles stiffen. \u201cI don\u2019t think...\u201d He trails off as I begin to place kisses all over his chest, making sure to touch each scar, wishing it would take the memories of them away, but knowing memories that dark don\u2019t go away.</p> <p>My head travels upward to his collarbone, his neck, his chin. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing or what I\u2019m feeling, but it\u2019s new and raw and sends adrenaline through my body. When I reach his lips, I place a kiss on them and then move away.</p><p>His eyes are amplified, his breathing erratic, and his face is filled with agony. I tense, worried I\u2019ve done something wrong, but then his expression softens. He cups his hand around the back of my neck, his fingertips pressing into my skin as he leans in to kiss me with so much passion it rips away all the cold inside my body.</p><p>He backs us toward the bed, slipping the jacket off my shoulders and reaching for the bottom of my shirt. I tell myself I can handle it; that he\u2019s not going to hurt me as I raise my arms and he lifts it over my head.</p><p>A big step and it scares the shit out of me, but he crashes his lips into mine before my thoughts can catch up. I clutch onto his biceps as he unhooks the clasp of my bra and it falls off my arms. I barely breathe at the feel of his bare skin touching mine. It feels good. And bad. It feels like everything I\u2019ve wanted, but didn\u2019t think I could have.</p><p>His lips leave my mouth and move downward across the hollow of my neck, pausing at the top of my chest. My eyes roll shut at the first touch of his mouth against my nipple. I fist my hands, unsure where to channel the helpless energy as he slides his tongue along the curve of my breast. A pleading cry flees my lips as my knees start to give out. He grips at my waist, his palms scorching with heat as he steadies me, and makes a path of kisses across my chest. A tingly sensation spreads between my thighs and I cry out, grabbing handfuls of his hair as my heart throbs inside my chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d Kayden murmurs as I struggle to stay on my feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he mutters as he pins me down. I struggle to break free, but his knees press down on my shins and his fingers wrap around my wrists, trapping my arms above my head.</p><p>It all comes crashing down like the rain and the lightning outside. My eyes snap open and I jerk away, folding my arms across my chest. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry. I-I can\u2019t do this.\u201d</p> <p>He blinks his eyes, shocked. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>I turn in a circle, searching the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just need my shirt.\u201d I kick some of the clothes on the floor out of the way, my lungs squeezing tightly, constricting my oxygen flow. \u201cI just need my shirt.\u201d</p><p>His fingers graze my arm and I flinch, sucking in a deep breath, forcing back the tears. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d he begs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d I shrug off his hand as tears spill from my eyes. \u201cI just need to go.\u201d</p><p>His hands come down on my shoulders and he forces me to face him. I keep my eyes locked on the floor, refusing to look at him. He hooks his finger under my chin and elevates my face upward.</p><p>He scans the tears and his eyes widen. \u201cOh my god, I thought you were okay with going that far. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not you or that.\u201d I wrench my face away from him and back toward the door with my arms still covering my chest.</p><p>\u201cThen, what is it?\u201d He steps toward me, searching my eyes desperately for an answer. \u201cCallie, you\u2019re really freaking me out right now. Please tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, backing away, my shoulders curling inward in humiliation. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you. I just need to go.\u201d</p><p>As the foul feeling in my stomach begins to build, owning me, controlling me, I reel for the door, ready to run out without a shirt on. He hurries in front of me, blocking my way with his body.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t walk out there like that,\u201d he says, his eyes skimming my bare chest.</p><p>\u201cI need to get out of here,\u201d I choke, clutching at my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I did something wrong... did I hurt you or something?\u201d</p><p>My shoulders lurch as I choke through the sobs. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything. He did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did?\u201d He steps toward me and I\u2019m verging on shoving my finger down my throat right there in front of him because I can\u2019t hold it in.</p><p>I skitter to the side, trying to dodge around him, the walls closing in on me. I need air. \u201cI need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>His fingers snag my waist. \u201cI can\u2019t let you go out like that. Just trust me enough to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie.\u201d He\u2019s freaking out. I\u2019m freaking out. The entire situation is a mess. \u201cI can handle anything you tell me.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as my knees buckle and his arms hold me up. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t.\u201d The vomit burns at the back of my throat as my ears ring and my eyes blur over with more tears. I\u2019m hyperventilating and dizziness floods through my body. \u201cNo one wants to handle hearing about a twelve-year-old being raped... I have to keep it locked away. I have to...\u201d I trail off, knowing I\u2019ll never get it back.</p><p>I jerk from his arms, feeling ashamed, but he grabs my hand and yanks on my arm, crashing me against him. He cradles my head, smoothing my hair as my shoulders shake and my tears soak his scarred chest.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>#34 Let Someone Kayden Get Close to You</p><p>Kayden</p><p>If I could hold her forever, I would. I wasn\u2019t expecting that to come out of her mouth. I knew she had something dark hidden inside her, but not that. It hurts deep inside my chest and I have a hard time not busting my fist against the headboard again. The only thing that stops me is I don\u2019t want to take my arms off her.</p><p>She cried forever and each sob nearly ripped me in two. It was like stitches coming apart. Eventually she fell asleep curled up against me with her head tucked against my chest. I trace lines on her bare back, staring off into empty space, wondering how anyone could have done that to her.</p><p>I don\u2019t know if I can handle it. The longer I lay there, the more worked up I get as feelings of anger consume me. I flex my hands, stab my nails into my skin, fight to stay still.</p><p>Callie begins to stir and peers up at me with her swollen, bloodshot eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask, brushing her hair back from her forehead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her voice is hoarse, her cheeks red, and her pupils are dilated.</p><p>I pause, not sure what question is the right question, or if one even exists. \u201cCallie, what you told me... who else knows about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d Her bare shoulders rise and fall as she fights to breathe. \u201cExcept for Seth.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate, my fingers still in her hair. \u201cNot even your mom?\u201d</p><p>The sadness in her eyes nearly kills me. \u201cOnly you and Seth.\u201d She tucks her head down, hiding her face.</p><p>I want to ask her who it was, so I can hunt them down and fucking beat him to death. Thousands of ideas flood my mind, but I never knew her well enough to make assumptions. I could ask her, but at the moment she might break if I do. I know because I\u2019ve been at that point most of my life.</p><p>\u201cI think we should get you dressed.\u201d I lift my head and glance over her shoulder at the clock on the nightstand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You probably have stuff to do and I\u2019m sitting here, holding you up.\u201d She slants her head to the side to slip out from my arm, but I flex my arms and hug her against me.</p><p>\u201cI only said that because Luke\u2019s going to be home soon,\u201d I explain, inching her face closer to mine. \u201cNot because I want you to get dressed and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She relaxes a little, the locks of her hair spreading across my chest as she lowers her face down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sweep some of her hair to the side, which smells faintly of rain, and kiss her gently on the lips. When I pull away, she seems surprised.</p><p>\u201cKayden... I-I...\u201d She struggles for words. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be with me because you feel sorry for me. I didn\u2019t even mean to tell you that. I just got caught up in the moment.\u201d</p><p>I gaze down at her, astounded. \u201cI\u2019m with you because I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>She swallows hard. \u201cEven after what I told you?\u201d</p> <p>I brush my finger along her cheekbone. \u201cCallie, I feel the exact same way about you now as I did an hour ago. Nothing\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>She fights back tears as she blinks her eyes. \u201cAre you sure? Because sometimes... sometimes I\u2019m a mess. What happened just barely wasn\u2019t a one-time thing. I get that way when I remember things.\u201d</p><p>I nod, scared as hell. I want to be with her, more than anything at the moment. I just hope I can handle it, for her sake.</p><p>Callie</p><p>I didn\u2019t mean to drop it on him like a giant bomb, but the need to get away from him so I could rid the vile feeling in my body was too overpowering. I let it slip out, hoping he\u2019d freak out and let me go, but he did the opposite. He held on, allowing me to cry, letting me break apart, and giving me more than he\u2019ll ever know.</p> <p>Saying it aloud to him was liberating, like I took hold of a part of my life again. I just hope it stays that way.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t let me go as I sit up, his body rising up with me. He releases me briefly to climb over me and pick up my bra from off the floor. I loop my arms through the straps and my hands tremble as I reach around to fasten the clasp. He gathers up my shirt next, shaking it out, then slips it over my head. I elevate my arms as he pulls it down over me to cover me up.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do for the rest of the day?\u201d he asks and glances at the window. \u201cOr, should I say night?\u201d</p><p>I pull the shirt over the last of my stomach and flip my hair out from under the collar. \u201cI should probably go back to my dorm and get caught up on my homework. I have a lot of papers to write still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know school is basically going to end in a few days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I missed a lot of classes when I was... avoiding you.\u201d</p> <p>He grabs a red shirt from his dresser and pulls it over his head, ruffling his hair into place. \u201cDo you want me to walk you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to,\u201d I say, feeling guilty for making him do something else for me. He\u2019s already done enough for the night.</p><p>A small smile touches at his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you back.\u201d</p><p>We head outside together and I feel strange, especially when he places his hand over mine. The lights of my building glimmer in the distance and all I can focus on is getting there.</p><p>\u201cAre you going home for Thanksgiving?\u201d he asks as we cross the wet grass and duck beneath the trees, where rain showers down on us.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it, but maybe. My parents were going to fly to Florida for the holidays, but I got a text from my mom earlier today saying they were staying home and that I should come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should ride with Luke and me,\u201d he suggests as we cross the street, through the puddles, and hop over the curb. \u201cWe\u2019re heading back in a few days or so.\u201d</p><p>There are many reasons why I don\u2019t want to go home; one being that the guy that ruined my life could be staying at my house. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it and let you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know it could be fun,\u201d he says with a quirky smirk. \u201cYou could hang out with Luke and I and we could show you the nonexistent fun times of our life.\u201d</p><p>I offer him a half smile, because his words remind me of my life back home and how much I hate it. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>He licks his lips, looking like he might kiss me, and even though I want him to, I still worry that he\u2019s doing this for the wrong reasons. I reach for the handle of the door to my dorm building. \u201cThanks for walking me home.\u201d I slip my fingers out of his and hurry down the hall, leaving him stunned. I try not to look at the bathroom as I pass by it, but it\u2019s all I can think about, and I end up backtracking.</p><p>Once I\u2019m finished I can breathe again.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I can\u2019t stop thinking about what happened to Callie. I think she thought telling me would scare me off, but it\u2019s had the opposite effect. I want nothing more than to be with her and protect her, like no one ever did for me. I want to make sure nothing else bad happens to her.</p><p>It\u2019s getting close to the holidays and I\u2019m preparing to go back home. Honestly, I don\u2019t want to go back there, but where else am I going to go? I don\u2019t have anyone, but my mom and dad as shitty as they may be. And my mom practically begged me, saying that Tyler would be home and I haven\u2019t seen him in years. I wonder what he\u2019s like now, after years of drinking.</p><p>Callie and I have spent the last few days together, watching movies and talking, but it\u2019s been strictly a friend thing. Not because I want it to be, but because I have no idea how to try and take it farther.</p><p>I\u2019m walking back to my dorm from my last class before I head home when I spot her wandering around through the trees, reading a book. Her hair is down to her shoulders and she has a long-sleeved grey shirt on and black jeans.</p><p>\u201cReading anything good?\u201d I ask, stopping in front of her.</p><p>Her head whips up and she snaps the book shut, which actually is her journal. \u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>I eye the notebook and then cock my eyebrow. \u201cYou know one day you\u2019re going to have to let me read some of the stuff you put in there.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head quickly, hugging the notebook against her chest, the blood rushing to her cheeks. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>Her reaction makes me want to read it even more.</p><p>We walk across the grass together with no real direction other than to make it to the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cHave you decided if you\u2019re going home yet?\u201d I ask, stuffing my hands into my pockets. \u201cYou know I really want you to.\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cSo does my mom, but I don\u2019t know... I\u2019m just not a fan of being at home. It reminds me of too many things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine does, too,\u201d I agree. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we should go together. We can take off every day and hang out. Luke\u2019s not a fan of his home either, so I know he\u2019ll give us a ride wherever.\u201d</p><p>She peeks up through her eyelashes with a skeptical look on her face. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound skeptical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that... it seems kind of unbelievable that you, Luke, and I would hang out like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs, her shoes scuffing against the mud at the edge of the lawn. \u201cBecause we never did before. We\u2019ve known each other for years and the only time we\u2019ve talked is while we\u2019ve been here. Away from Afton.\u201d</p><p>I reel in front of her and she almost runs into me. \u201cYou think I\u2019d ditch you because we were back home?\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders shift upward as she shrugs again and stares at the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of inevitable. People will be there and a lot of people you hang out with don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>I secure my finger under her chin and incline her head up, looking into her sad blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re referring to Daisy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaisy, her friends, everyone we went to school with,\u201d she says miserably. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter. I just don\u2019t feel like going home.\u201d</p><p>She swipes her card through the lock and I open the door to her building. The warm air encircles us as we walk down the unoccupied hallway. \u201cThen, what are you going to do? Stay here by yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big girl,\u201d she says as we get onto the elevators and then shakes her head when I begin to smile. \u201cI don\u2019t mean in the literal sense.\u201d</p><p>The elevator rises up and I stay quiet as I try to figure out a way to persuade her into going with me. When we reach her bedroom door, I begin to panic. The thought of leaving her here by herself is ripping at my heart.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to be completely honest here.\u201d I take a deep breath, because what I\u2019m about to say is very real and more honest than I\u2019ve ever been. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be away from you for that long.\u201d</p><p>She sucks her bottom lip into her mouth and bites on it. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d She extends her hand toward the lock and punches the code. She starts to turn the knob, but I catch her wrist.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d I assure her with an unsteady voice. \u201cI\u2019m becoming attached to our little talks and... and you\u2019re the only one that really knows everything about me.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders sink as she looks at me with empathy. \u201cI\u2019ll have to talk to my mom first and ask her a few things. I\u2019ll let you know tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I release her and step back, feeling somewhat better. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll really think about it.\u201d</p><p>She nods, twisting the doorknob. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She takes a step inside, but I can\u2019t let her go yet. My fingers snag her sleeve and I pull her back out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before either of us can protest, I seal my lips to hers, stealing our breaths away. My hand touches her face and I hold her cheek in my palm while my other hand presses against her lower back, arching her body against mine. I slip my tongue into her mouth, just a quick kiss, but it conveys all the hunger I feel inside. Our legs give out and my hand snaps out, bracing us against the wall before we fall to the floor. She lets out a soft moan and I pull away, knowing if I go any farther it\u2019s going to be that much harder to let her go.</p><p>She blinks her eyes wildly as I back down the hall with a grin on my face. \u201cAnd remember, you promised.\u201d</p><p>With a dazed look in her eyes, she walks inside her room, and tosses her notebook onto her bed, before shutting the door.</p><p>\u201cDo you have your old year book with you?\u201d I ask Luke when I enter our room.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d he says, looking away from the television for a split second. He\u2019s playing a racing game, totally zoned out as his fingers hammer at the control buttons. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I look at it for a second?\u201d I grab a can of soda out of the mini fridge.</p><p>He points at the closet door, his eyes returning to the screen. \u201cI think it\u2019s in my trunk in there.\u201d</p><p>Setting the can down on the foot of my bed, I go into the closet. Unlatching the locks of the trunk, I raise the lid and search through the books until I find it tucked in the side. I fan through the pages until I get to the \u201cL\u201d section and find \u201cCallie Lawrence.\u201d</p><p>The girl in the picture is not the Callie I know. Her hair is to her chin and choppy, like she cut it herself. She has on a baggy jacket that hides her slim shoulders and heavy black eyeliner that swallows her beautiful blue eyes. The same sadness is there, though; haunting her.</p><p>I scan some more pages for her, but it\u2019s like she barely existed. I get to my feet, put the book back, and shut the trunk, wondering what it would have been like if we had been friends in high school. For some reason, I think that maybe things would have been a little easier and the pressure on my shoulders would have been a little bit more bearable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Callie</p><p>Seth wakes me up the next morning by nudging me a ton of times in the ribs. He has iced lattes in his hands, his blond hair is a little messy, and a he has a determined look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI had this dream,\u201d he starts, lowering himself onto the edge of my bed. \u201cThat you may need to talk to me. In fact, I have this really bad feeling that you\u2019ve been keeping something from me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I haven\u2019t told him how I broke down in front of Kayden. He\u2019s been really happy lately, going on dates with Greyson, and I didn\u2019t want to ruin his mood with my dark thoughts.</p> <p>I sit up and take the iced coffee, nearly downing it in just a few sips. \u201cI thought you were heading home this morning?\u201d</p><p>He nods, sipping on his straw. \u201cI am, but I\u2019m giving Greyson a ride, so I have to leave a little bit late.\u201d</p><p>I guide my legs to my chest and rest my chin on my knee. \u201cIs he going home with you?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head with a look of astonishment on his face \u201cNo way. Could you imagine if I brought a guy home to meet my mom? Besides, I barely know him.\u201d</p><p>I elevate my chin away from my knee and chew on my straw. \u201cBut how long do you have to know someone before it means something?\u201d</p> <p>He sits down on my bed and rests his arms on my knees. \u201cThat\u2019s for the people who are in the situation to decide, which brings me to part of the reason I stopped by.\u201d</p><p>I fake a pout. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to say good-bye to your best friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason,\u201d he says in a serious tone. \u201cThe other reason is that I ran into Kayden this morning. Now, typically we have quick little chats about really stupid stuff, but today, he kept asking me about you. He wanted to know if I knew what you were doing for Thanksgiving and if I\u2019d checked on you lately. Now would you like to tell me anything?\u201d</p><p>I frown. \u201cDo I have to?\u201d</p><p>He nods, placing the plastic cup on the ground beside his feet. \u201cDid something happen between you two?\u201d</p><p>I dither. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>He waits patiently for me to explain. Sighing, I finally spill it out to him leaving out a few of the more intense details but giving him enough that he gets the gist of it.</p><p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d he says, his brown eyes huge. \u201cLike told him, told him? Why did you not tell me this earlier? That is the kind of info that should be divulged to me as soon as it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you were happy and because I don\u2019t even know how I feel about it. I mean, I told him by accident.\u201d I throw the blankets off me and scoot over to the edge of the bed, swinging my feet to the floor. \u201cDuring a freak out moment on my part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was touching you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that wasn\u2019t it. I liked that he was touching me, he just said something that reminded me of... it.\u201d</p><p>He stirs his straw around in his drink. \u201cKayden was okay with you? He didn\u2019t hurt you or make you feel like shit after you told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seemed okay.\u201d I grab my drink and the condensation dampens my skin. \u201cBut he could have been doing it because he felt sorry for me.\u201d</p><p>Seth thrums his fingers on his knee. \u201cOr because he understands what it\u2019s like to have someone hurt him.\u201d</p> <p>I wipe my wet hand on the front of my pants. \u201cThat might be, but I don\u2019t want him to have to deal with my problems. He has so many of his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe, it\u2019s that he scares you because he makes you feel things your uncertain about.\u201d He points out.</p><p>\u201cAre you Psych 101ing me again?\u201d I ask, getting to my feet.</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cMaybe, but the thing is I think he really cares for you. You should have heard him that day when you were in the library and I called you so he could find out where you were. He was really worried about you.\u201d</p><p>I grab a rubber band from the box on top of my dresser and fasten it around my hair, leaving pieces out around the front of my face. \u201cProbably because I ran out on him after I...\u201d I trail off.</p><p>\u201cHad an orgasm?\u201d he finishes. \u201cOrgasm. Orgasm. Orgasm. It\u2019s not a bad word, Callie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d I finish off the last of my drink, sucking the whip cream off the straw before tossing the empty cup into the garbage.</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d He stands up, smoothing out the wrinkles on his skinny jeans. \u201cHere\u2019s what I suggest. You should go home for Thanksgiving. Ride with Kayden and Luke, go back and have some fun. Don\u2019t sit around here by yourself. It makes me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to go with them,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut what if he\u2019s there?\u201d</p><p>He hands me my phone. \u201cCall your mom and find out.\u201d</p><p>I snatch my phone from him. \u201cI\u2019ll send a text.\u201d</p><p>Me: Who all is going to be staying at our house for Thanksgiving?</p><p>Mom: No one so far. Your brother said he wasn\u2019t coming back and Grandma and Grandpa canceled. Please tell me you\u2019re coming home sweetie.</p><p>I hesitate and let out a frustrated grunt.</p><p>Me: I\u2019ll come home, but I need to see if I can catch a ride still.</p><p>Mom: Dad can come get you if you need him to.</p><p>Me: I might be able to ride home with someone.</p><p>Mom: Who?</p><p>Me: Someone</p><p>Mom: Callie Lawrence, what are you keeping from me? Is it someone I know?\u201d</p><p>Me: I don\u2019t know.</p><p>Mom: Callie, just tell me. Please. I\u2019ll bake you your favorite pie.</p><p>Me: Gotta pack. C u soon.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Seth mutters as he reads the text from over my shoulder, blowing his coffee breath on me. \u201cShe\u2019s super obsessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not use to me having friends.\u201d I change my ringer to vibrate and put my phone into my back pocket. \u201cShe probably knows it\u2019s someone from back home.\u201d</p><p>A conniving grin expands across his face as he taps his fingers together. \u201cWhat do you think she\u2019ll do when she finds out who it is?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, grabbing a bag from under my bed, and then dramatically wave my hands in front of me. \u201cFreak out. Jump up and down and go, \u2018Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\"</p><p>He giggles. \u201cBut you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>I nod with my heart squeezing inside my chest. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m going. Just as long as Kayden will give me a ride.\u201d</p><p>He covers his mouth with his hand to muffle his laughter. \u201cI bet he would love to give you a ride.\u201d</p><p>I press my lips together, holding back a smile. Pretend all I want, the idea makes my body tingle. I begin putting my clothes in a bag, ignoring his remark.</p><p>\u201cDo me a favor.\u201d He steps in front of me and looks me in the eye with a stern expression. \u201cLet him get close to you if he wants to, okay? In fact, you can cross off number thirty-four on the list.\u201d</p><p>I fold up my jacket and set it in the bag. \u201cThat\u2019s let someone get close to you and I already have\u2014you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m crossing it off and putting Kayden\u2019s name up there.\u201d He backs for the door, pausing before he walks out. \u201cCall me every day so I don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I say firmly with a salute and he laughs. \u201cAnd vice versa.\u201d</p><p>Once he\u2019s gone, I finish packing and sink down onto the bed to dial Kayden\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he answers and something thumps in the background.</p><p>\u201cHey... are you getting ready to head back home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re carrying our stuff out to the truck right now. I was actually just getting ready to come over to your dorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He chuckles into the phone. \u201cTo make sure you were getting packed to go back home.\u201d</p><p>I peel away at my thumbnail. \u201cWho said I was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Seth this morning and he promised me he\u2019d talk you into it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I knew he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2019s kind of turning into a traitor,\u201d I reply, lying back on the bed and staring at the poster on the wall across from me.</p><p>\u201cCallie, if you don\u2019t want to go, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut I really want you to.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m still not sure I want to. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be ready in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>I hang up and stare out the window at the leaves and dirt splattered against the grass, put there by the wind. How could the direction of my life change so fast? I\u2019m doing things I wouldn\u2019t normally do, trusting people, feeling things, living life. I wonder how long it will last.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>#21 Let Yourself Be Bored</p><p>Callie</p><p>It\u2019s been two days since Kayden and Luke dropped me off at my house. Luckily, it was at night, so my mom didn\u2019t run out and embarrass me. I\u2019ve heard from Kayden quite a few times through texting, but we haven\u2019t hung out.</p><p>The entire drive home, I had an out-of-body experience. I was riding in the truck with Kayden and Luke and it was surreal, like I was watching it happen to me instead of living it. I\u2019ve had a few similar moments, but they were never good like that. They were bad and full of images I wish I could have been blind to.</p><p>It\u2019s a couple of days before Thanksgiving and my mom and I are in the kitchen. The cupboards are stacked with food, the stove with pans, and the sink with dirty dishes. There are orange and brown leafy decorations along the tan walls, in the center of the table, in the windowsill, framing the doorway\u2014my mom has always been a big holiday decorator.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe how much you\u2019ve changed.\u201d My mother beams at me and I shake my head, chopping an apple on a cutting board. She touches my hair, noting the length of it. \u201cAnd you stopped cutting your hair. I\u2019m so glad. I\u2019ve wanted it longer since the day you cut it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m a fan of it,\u201d I lie, angling my head sideways and moving it away from her. I\u2019m a fan when Kayden\u2019s touching it, which he did during most of the drive here, but that\u2019s it. \u201cIn fact, I think I\u2019m going to chop it off again.\u201d</p><p>She puts her hands on her hips and narrows her hazel eyes. \u201cCallie Lawrence, you will do no such thing. You look so beautiful, honey. A little skinny, but that\u2019s probably because you\u2019re not wearing all those baggy clothes.\u201d</p><p>I fidget with the corner of my fitted black t-shirt. \u201cI\u2019m as skinny as I\u2019ve always been.\u201d</p><p>She reaches behind her back and refastens the tie on her apron with little apple patterns on it. \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to fatten you up a little. I\u2019m making food galore.\u201d</p><p>I set the chopping knife down and reach for another apple. \u201cWhy? If it\u2019s going to be just you, me, and dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re going over to the Owens\u2019 this year.\u201d She takes a wooden spoon out of a drawer, tucking a strand of her long brown hair behind her ear. \u201cThey\u2019ve invited a lot of people, like they did a couple of years ago.\u201d</p><p>I frown as I recollect the dinner she is talking about. That was the year Kayden started getting serious with Daisy and she made that dinner for me a living hell. \u201cWho\u2019s going to be there?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs and starts humming to the song playing from the stereo. \u201cShould we go get our hair done that day before the dinner? Wouldn\u2019t that be fun? To get all dressed up?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m about to tell her no, and that it sounds like the last thing I want to do, when my phone beeps, announcing there\u2019s a text message waiting.</p><p>Kayden: Did you know that Mrs. McGregor is having an affair with Tom Pelonie?</p><p>Me: Um... what?</p><p>Kayden: Or that Tina Millison is getting a new Mercedes for Christmas?</p> <p>Me: Should I know this? Because I\u2019m really confused.</p><p>Kayden: I think my mother needs a friend. She\u2019s been following me all over the house, telling me the latest gossip. She even wanted me to take her to get her nails done.</p><p>I snort a laugh, but quickly erase it when my mom looks at me questioningly.</p><p>Me: I guess she misses you.</p><p>Kayden: No, she\u2019s bored and needs to lay off the wine. I think my dad\u2019s been on a lot of trips while I was gone and the empty house has made her lose her sanity more than she already had before I left.</p> <p>Me: Mine wants me to go get my hair done with her.</p><p>Kayden: Yeah, but you\u2019re a girl.</p><p>Me: Oh, I forgot for a sec. Thanx for reminding me.</p><p>Kayden: I haven\u2019t forgotten at all. In fact, it\u2019s all I think about all the time.</p><p>Me: That I\u2019m a girl???</p><p>Kayden: That ur a girl I very badly want to touch right now.</p> <p>I press my lips together, uncertain how to respond. We\u2019ve barely kissed once since I dropped my secret on him and suddenly he\u2019s talking dirty to me.</p><p>\u201cCallie, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d My mother asks with concern. \u201cYou look flushed.\u201d</p><p>I glance up from the message at her worried eyes. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She reaches for my phone. \u201cWho are you texting?\u201d</p><p>I turn my back on her and walk to the table, so she can\u2019t see my face.</p><p>Kayden: Did I scare u off?</p><p>Me: No, I was just thinking about something.</p><p>Kayden: About me touching you?</p> <p>\u201cCallie, the pans are boiling over,\u201d my mom says. \u201cCan you turn the temperature down?\u201d</p><p>Me: I have to go. My mom\u2019s having a cooking crisis</p><p>Kayden: Okay, I\u2019ll text u later. Be prepared to give me an answer ;)</p><p>My skin is hot as I run over to the stove and turn the knobs to low. Steam fills the air as I take a lid off one of the pots and stir the noodles in the water.</p><p>\u201cSo, about getting our hair done.\u201d My mom picks the conversation up right where we left off. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go up to my room,\u201d I evade her question, wiping my hands on a paper towel. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of stuff to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s break time,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be spending time together. What are you going to do up there besides be bored?\u201d</p><p>My mother has always wanted me to be things I\u2019m not, even before I changed. When I was six she wanted me to be a ballerina and I wanted to be a football player. When I was ten she thought it would be neat if we bought me a whole wardrobe of dresses for school and all I wanted was to pierce my ears. When I was eleven I decided I wanted to learn how to play the guitar. She signed me up for beauty pageant lessons.</p><p>\u201cBeing bored isn\u2019t all that bad.\u201d I put the knife in the sink and walk toward the back door. \u201cI\u2019ll come back in a little bit.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s cold outside as I head for the garage, a light frost glazing the windows and railing. While I was away at college, my mom and dad put a ton of boxes in my room, along with my dad\u2019s football memorabilia. I could either sleep on the couch in the living room or stay in the apartment above the garage. I chose the garage for privacy reasons. Plus I like that I don\u2019t have to stay in my room, haunted by memories that will keep me awake all night. Up here it\u2019s peaceful and quiet\u2014my mind is somewhat clear from the storm.</p><p>I climb the stairs and shut the door behind me, cranking up the two space heaters before grabbing my journal out of my bag. I take out my iPod and put my ear buds in, scrolling to \u201cSeth\u2019s Awesome Playlist.\u201d Seth has a very broad taste in music and I wonder what\u2019s going to turn on when I click on the first song. \u201cWork\u201d by Jimmy Eat World flows into my ears as I flop down onto the mattress and kick my feet up on the metal headboard.</p><p>I open my journal and put the pen to the paper, my heart and mind racing wildly.</p><p>I\u2019ve been wondering over the last few days what it would be like to be with Kayden. Like really, really be with him. The more I explore the idea, the more I wonder about it. Sometimes, it feels wrong thinking about this stuff, but other times, I enjoy my thoughts and very vivid images. It\u2019s like I\u2019m not me anymore, like he\u2019s changed me into a girl who thinks about the possibilities of life and love.</p><p>I was daydreaming the other day in the living room, picturing his mouth on my breast, like it was that night before I flipped out, when my mom came into the room.</p><p>\u201cYou look so happy,\u201d she said, sitting on the couch beside me. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen you smile like this.\u201d</p><p>I looked at her, and I mean really looked at her for a moment. Did it ever once cross her mind, even for just a split second, that maybe something terrible happened to me? Did she wonder, but the idea was so dark that her mind couldn\u2019t grasp it?</p><p>A warm hand touches my shoulder, startling me, and I wrench my arm away as I bolt upright, dropping my pen and notebook on the bed.</p><p>Kayden takes a step back, putting his hands up in front of him as I breathe profusely, kneeling up in the bed. He\u2019s wearing a pair of cargo shorts, a black hoodie, and sneakers. His hair is tucked under a beanie and his mouth moves as he says something.</p><p>I quickly tug on the cord of my ear buds. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom told me you were up here.\u201d He glances around at the tiny room that has no carpet and only sheetrock for walls, his gaze lingering briefly on the unmade bed. \u201cIs this your room or a guest room or what?\u201d</p><p>I set the iPod down on the bed and stand up. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a guest house. My parents have been working on it for years, but this is as far as they got.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at a small hole in the wall that needs to be spackled. \u201cMy parents would flip if any part of our house was like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine get sidetracked with other stuff; sports, town meetings, pie baking contests, trying to beg my brother and I not to go so far away for college. They have attachment issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they would rather do life. I like that.\u201d He faces me, his emerald eyes sparkling. \u201cYour mom seems nice. I know I\u2019ve met her before and everything, but she seemed really chatty this time.\u201d</p><p>I internally cringe. \u201cWhat did she say to you?\u201d</p><p>He pulls the beanie off and tousles his hair with his fingers so the bottom ends flip up and wisps hang over his forehead. \u201cNot too much.\u201d</p><p>I aim a doubtful look at him and arch my eyebrows. \u201cReally? Because I kind of doubt it. In fact, I bet she said a lot to you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s working hard not to smile. \u201cShe was completely nice.\u201d He circles around me, and I revolve my body to face him. \u201cShe said she was so excited that we were hanging out and that she\u2019s so glad we\u2019re good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell her any of that,\u201d I tell him, feeling embarrassed. \u201cShe just assumes things.\u201d</p><p>He steps around behind me and I start to turn to follow him again, but he wraps his fingers around my upper arms to hold me in place, pressing his chest to my back. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you tell her that?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, shivering a little from his breath on my neck as he leans his head over my shoulder. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t tell her anything. I-I don\u2019t...\u201d I drift off as his mouth moves beside my ear and grazes the tip of it.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re not good friends, then what are we, Callie?\u201d He pulls my earlobe into his mouth and drags his teeth gently along the skin. \u201cCause I would really like to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I breathe, wondering where the hell this is coming from.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about that text and I decided I just needed to come here and hear your answer,\u201d he whispers, his voice husky. \u201cI actually would have come over sooner, but my dad\u2019s been making me work out. He said... he said I let myself go a little while I\u2019ve been gone.\u201d</p><p>His rock hard chest that is pressed up against my back indicates just how big of a liar his dad is.</p><p>\u201cAre you... okay?\u201d I ask cautiously. \u201cI mean, your dad hasn\u2019t... done anything to you, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. He\u2019s barely been there. I guess he\u2019s been going to a lot of town meetings and charity events. My parents always were good at putting on a great appearance for the outside eye.\u201d He pauses. \u201cAre you okay? We haven\u2019t really talked much about stuff. I wanted to talk to you in the car, but Luke was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t really feel like talking.\u201d</p><p>He hesitates, breathing in and out, my back rising and falling with the steady movement of his chest. \u201cThen what do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>What I was writing about in my journal. \u201cI don\u2019t know...\u201d A soft whimper flees from my throat as he bites softly on the spot below my ear.</p><p>His arm snakes around my waist and up my stomach, between my breasts, and up to my neck. Pressing his fingers against my jawline, he turns my head toward him while holding my body in place. Up close, I notice there\u2019s a scratch on the side of his cheek and a little bit of stubble on his chin.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I reach up and trace my fingers gently down his cheek. \u201cWhere did this come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a tiny cut.\u201d His pupils shrink as his eyes open wider. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I promise.\u201d</p><p>My chest presses against his arm as my breathing accelerates and his eyes focus on my lips. He inches his mouth closer to mine, and my eyes shut on their own accord as his lips graze mine. His mouth moves leisurely as he keeps one arm across my chest, while his other travels along my stomach, his hand gripping onto the fabric of my shirt. I try to figure out what to do with my hands and finally just grab onto his arms. Letting my lips part, my head falls back as his warm tongue delves into my mouth and it steals the air from my lungs.</p><p>Suddenly, he tenses and leans back, looking me in the eyes. \u201cDo you want me to stop? Because you can always tell me if you need me to slow down.\u201d</p><p>I consider it, but only for a moment and then shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d He checks and I nod way too enthusiastically.</p><p>Sliding his hands to my sides, he spins me around to face him. I stand on my tiptoes, hooking my arms around his neck, and he pushes on my lower back so my body arches against him. When our lips connect I feel a spark that tickles down my body and I moan ridiculously loud, my knees buckling. My cheeks start to heat, but he lets out a groan, cupping my face between his hands as he steps forward, leading us somewhere. My feet tangle with his as I back up and seconds later, we\u2019re falling onto the mattress.</p><p>I pray to God that this time the moment will last; that nothing from that day will catch up with me.</p><p>His body conforms to mine as one of his hands knots through my hair, his other hand kneading my thigh. I slip my hands underneath his shirt and feel the lines of his muscles and the bumps of his scars. His stomach tightens under my touch, but he continues to explore my mouth with his tongue, the tip running along the roof and then his teeth bite softly at my lip. His fingers begin to drift along the top of my jeans and my insides quiver. I rub my feet together, tightening my legs, trying to figure out how to relieve the tingling between my legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCallie...\u201d he groans and his hand starts to go down the front of my jeans as he rolls us to the side. I\u2019m surprised at how much my body wants him to touch me there, so I keep kissing him while little moans escape my lips and I thread my fingers through his hair. His fingers remain just inside my jeans, like he\u2019s testing me, and then finally he slips one inside me.</p><p>He inches his mouth away for a second to look me in the eyes. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m nervous and scared, but it feels so good. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I say and the breathlessness of my voice is all the reassurance he needs.</p><p>His finger start moving as he returns his lips to mine, slipping his tongue inside my mouth as his other hand feels my breast on the outside of my shirt, making a gasp rush out of me. My hips start to writhe up against him and he slides his hand away from my breast down to my thigh, guiding it over his hip so I\u2019m opened up to him.</p> <p>My head tips back against the pillow as I work to catch my breath. He leans back slightly, his finger massaging me from the inside, and he watches me in wonder as every single part of my body rises and falls. Something deep within me bursts with heat and I gasp, trying to hold onto it, but seconds later I come back down to reality.</p><p>Kayden slides his finger out of me and kisses me gently, his breath hot against my lips. \u201cAre you still good?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head up and down, my breathing erratic and my skin damp with sweat. \u201cI\u2019m great.\u201d</p><p>He smiles at my answer and I would probably blush under normal circumstances, but the high in my body still lingers. He lies down on his back with his arm tucked under my neck, his fingers combing through my hair, as he stares at the ceiling with a puzzled expression on his face. \u201cI have to go meet up with Luke. He kept texting me, saying he needed to get the fuck out of the house. I told him I was stopping by here for a few minutes and then I\u2019d be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Okay.\u201d I\u2019m kind of hurt he\u2019s taking off.</p> <p>\u201cI promise we won\u2019t hang out with him for the whole night.\u201d He climbs off the bed and extends his hand to me. \u201cWe can come back here a little later or maybe go catch a movie.\u201d</p><p>I take his hand and stare up at him. \u201cYou want me to go with you?\u201d</p><p>He lifts me to my feet with his eyebrows dipped. \u201cWhat? Did you think I just came over here to... to do that to you?\u201d</p><p>I feel stupid. \u201cMaybe. You were texting me all that stuff out of the blue.\u201d I shrug. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>He keeps holding my hand as he steps toward the door. \u201cCallie, I\u2019m not using you. The whole texting thing was just my sexual tension catching up with me. If you don\u2019t want to do stuff, you can say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to do stuff,\u201d I say. \u201cThat night, when that stuff happened, I only panicked because of something you said that reminded me of what happened... with that other thing. It wasn\u2019t because of anything you did.\u201d</p> <p>The worry in his eyes subsides as he brings my wrist to his lips and kisses it delicately. \u201cSo we\u2019re good to keep going?\u201d</p><p>I nod, even though I have no idea where we are going. I\u2019m extremely interested to find out, though, especially after what we just did. I always believed that stuff like that wouldn\u2019t be possible for me; that it would remind me too much of what happened, but all I was thinking about the entire time was Kayden. Everything else left my mind.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>#7 Do Something Just Because It\u2019s Fun.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m getting in too deep. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her after Luke and I dropped her off at her house, which is why I had been staying away. The longer I did, the more intense my feelings got. All I could think about was being with her, especially because my dad has been an asshole ever since I got home. He hasn\u2019t hit me, but he doesn\u2019t make it easy to be around him, even just a little amount of time.</p><p>Finally, I decided to go see Callie because I knew seeing her would make me feel better. I was just going to make it a quick stop, but so many emotions raced through me, I couldn\u2019t control myself and things ended up a little heated. When Callie came, I nearly died. All I wanted to do was rip off her clothes and thrust my cock inside her, feel her everywhere\u2014feel everything. But I\u2019m afraid of what will happen if we cross that line. What it will mean to her\u2014what it will mean to me. My head\u2019s so screwed up. I should walk away from her, but I\u2019m too fucking weak.</p><p>Callie wanders around the small room in the basement of my house, taking in my trophies and pictures on the wall. She glances at the bed in the corner and then at the leather couches and television. The spot on the wall that I punched has been repaired, like that night never happened. But it did. And part of me is glad it did, because it brought Callie into my life.</p> <p>\u201cSo what is this?\u201d she asks curiously. \u201cLike your bachelor pad?\u201d</p><p>I open the side door that leads to the outside to let in Luke, who ran out to the truck to grab a cooler. My dad\u2019s gone for the night, thankfully and my mom didn\u2019t see us pull in. \u201cI guess that\u2019s what you can call it. Really, it\u2019s just where my brothers and I use to hide out when we were trying to stay invisible.\u201d It\u2019s so strange talking to her openly about it.</p><p>She sits down on the back of the couch with her legs dangling over the edge. \u201cI wish I had one of these rooms when I was growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what the hell are we doing tonight?\u201d Luke stumbles inside carrying a blue cooler, his face is red, and there\u2019s dirt in his hair. \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d like to try and not relive the last night we hung out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d Callie asks curiously.</p><p>\u201cSomeone got really trashed and ended up getting punched by Dan Zelman.\u201d Luke glances at me as he drops the cooler down on the table. \u201cYou were really fucking stupid for picking a fight with him.\u201d</p><p>I wince at the memory, flexing my hand. \u201cYeah, that one hurt.\u201d</p><p>Callie looks at me. \u201cDan Zelman? He\u2019s like huge. Why would you pick a fight with him?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, joining her on the back of the couch. \u201cI was drunk.\u201d I lower my voice to a whisper and lean in toward her ear. \u201cAnd I was upset that I didn\u2019t have the guts to punch someone else earlier that morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad?\u201d she whispers, turning her head and her lips nearly touch mine.</p><p>I shift my weight uneasily. \u201cYeah, pretty much.\u201d</p><p>Luke opens the fridge and beer bottles fall out onto the floor, the glasses clinking together. \u201cDammit! That wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes with exaggeration and Callie giggles. I hop off the couch and go help him pick up the bottles, glad none of them spilled. The last thing I need is for my dad to come down here and find the carpet stained and reeking of beer.</p><p>After we get them picked up, Luke takes a bottle of Jack Daniels out of the cooler. \u201cShots all around.\u201d</p><p>Callie shakes her head, sliding her legs off the couch and jumping onto the floor. \u201cNo shots.\u201d</p><p>I flash her a playful grin. \u201cWhat? Didn\u2019t you enjoy the last time you got drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even remember anything,\u201d she says with a hint of laughter in her voice. \u201cAlthough, you can. So you tell me. Did I enjoy being drunk?\u201d</p><p>Grinning, I tuck a lock of her hair behind her ear. \u201cYou seemed to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be really nice if you just told me what I did and said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s better if I keep it to myself. Trust me, what you don\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what?\u201d Luke steps forward, unscrewing the cap off the bottle. \u201cWe can make it a game. That way, if you\u2019re really good, you won\u2019t ever have to drink.\u201d</p><p>Callie glances back and forth between us. \u201cWhat kind of a game?\u201d</p><p>Luke gives me a sidelong glance and I shake my head, knowing where he\u2019s going with this. \u201cThe rules are pretty easy. Someone says something like, I\u2019ve never fallen asleep on the front lawn of the next door neighbor\u2019s house, because I was so fucking drunk I thought it was my house.\u201d He extends the bottle toward me. \u201cAnd now he has to drink.\u201d</p><p>I snatch the bottle from him, let my head drop back, and force a large mouthful down my throat. \u201cThanks for making me the example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d Callie asks. \u201cIf you\u2019ve done what the person has said, then you have to drink?\u201d</p><p>I lick the alcohol from my lips. \u201cYeah, but you don\u2019t have to play. We can just hang out. Luke just thinks everything has to center around alcohol.\u201d</p><p>Luke yanks the bottle away from my hand, cutting me a harsh look. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m just trying to cure my boredom. There\u2019s nothing to do around here now that everyone\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Callie gives a one-shouldered shrug. \u201cWe can play. I haven\u2019t done much of anything, so it seems like the odds are in my favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you don\u2019t know much about us,\u201d Luke says wickedly. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be tough for you to come up with things to get us with.\u201d</p><p>She shrugs again with a look in her eye that makes me wonder if she does know something.</p><p>We settle on the couch with Callie on one side, and I sit on the other. Luke takes the recliner, kicking his feet up on the coffee table as he takes a drink straight from the bottle.</p><p>He sets the bottle down on the table. \u201cSo, who wants to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Callie offers, raising her hand.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I ask her. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t have to. You don\u2019t have to be a part of any of this.\u201d</p><p>She smiles innocently, twisting a strand of her hair around her finger. \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet her go,\u201d Luke says, draping his arms on the back of the sofa and relaxing back. \u201cI\u2019m really interested to hear what\u2019s going to come out of her mouth.\u201d</p><p>I motion at the bottle. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d</p><p>She bites on her lip, mulling it over, and then her eyes lock on Luke. \u201cI\u2019ve never argued with my coach about not being drunk when clearly I was wasted during a game.\u201d</p><p>Luke\u2019s expression falls. \u201cHow did you know about that?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cMy dad\u2019s the coach and I hear things.\u201d</p><p>With his eyes fastened on Callie, he tips his head back and gulps more than a shot out of the bottle. \u201cOkay, so now I\u2019ve got to get back at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t the rules!\u201d Callie glances at me for help, her blue eyes enlarging with panic. \u201cAre they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my rules.\u201d Luke taps his finger on his chin as he leans forward. \u201cI\u2019ve never stepped on a spray paint can and left a mess on the floor for the checkout guy to clean up.\u201d</p><p>She rolls her eyes with a smile emerging on her lips, showing a competitive side that I wish was directed at me.</p><p>Luke dangles the bottle in front of her face, taunting her, and she snatches it from him. Making a disgusted face at it, she puts her lips to the top, leans back, and sucks out a tiny swallow.</p><p>Gagging, she thrusts the bottle in Luke\u2019s direction with her head turned and her eyes shut. \u201cOh my God! That\u2019s worse than the vodka.\u201d She shudders as she blinks like crazy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laughing, I scoot closer to her on the sofa and put my arm around her shoulders. \u201cLuke plays dirty, Callie. Since you went after him first, he\u2019ll probably go after you a lot.\u201d</p><p>She sticks out her bottom lip, pouting, and it\u2019s glossy from the Jack.</p><p>\u201cHold on, you have something on your lips.\u201d I lean forward and suck it off.</p><p>Her eyes widen as I slide my tongue along my lips and move back. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Jack is pretty fucking gross.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d she agrees in an unsteady voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I have one,\u201d I say, clearing my throat. \u201cI\u2019ve never walked home wearing just a pink robe and a pair of slippers.\u201d</p><p>Callie snorts a laugh as Luke narrows his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking asking for it. I\u2019m going to tell her all your dirty little secrets now, you fucking douche.\u201d</p><p>I laugh, kicking my boots up on the table. \u201cThat was just to get you back for going after her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I hear why he had to do that?\u201d Callie asks as Luke takes a shot. \u201cBecause I\u2019m really curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was over at this girl\u2019s house,\u201d I start, ignoring Luke\u2019s death glare. \u201cAnd while they were having sex, her parents showed up. They\u2019d taken off all their clothes out in the living room, so he had to borrow her robe and slippers because it was the only thing he could fit in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fucking cold, too,\u201d Luke recollects as he drinks from the bottle again. \u201cAlthough, having sex with Carrie Delmarco made it kind of worth it.\u201d</p><p>Callie covers her mouth, her chin tipping down, probably to hide her embarrassment. It\u2019s fucking adorable and suddenly I find myself wishing Luke would leave so I could be alone with her.</p><p>\u201cI have one,\u201d Luke declares, shooting a malicious grin in my direction. His eyes are turning red and his speech is a little unbalanced. \u201cI\u2019ve never told a girl I was the lead singer of Chevelle just so I could hook up with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to fucking kill you for that one.\u201d I reach over the table to confiscate the bottle from his hand. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d</p><p>He grins at me as I take a drink and look at Callie. \u201cI was fifteen. I did a lot of stupid things back then.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t seem bothered, but sometimes she\u2019s hard to read. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, I have one.\u201d I focus on Luke, wanting to beat his ass. \u201cI\u2019ve never stripped teased on a table in front of an entire room full of people.\u201d</p><p>His brown eyes are cold as he slams back a shot and then forces the alcohol down his throat with a jerk of his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve never woke up crying in the middle of the night because I had a nightmare after watching Halloween.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was like ten,\u201d I protest, yanking the bottle from his hand. I knock back a big gulp, starting to feel the alcohol burning in my system. \u201cI\u2019ve never pissed my pants because I was locked out of the house and couldn\u2019t get in.\u201d</p><p>Luke grabs the bottle from my extended hand, spilling some Jack on the coffee table. \u201cI\u2019ve never sent a girl a check yes or no letter. Do you like me Tami Bentler? Do you think I\u2019m cute?\u201d</p><p>Callie busts up laughing, slapping her hand over her mouth as her shoulders hunch toward her knees. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to do with all this information.\u201d</p><p>I force another shot down my throat and wipe my lips clean with my sleeve. Even though I\u2019m pissed off that Luke is making me look like a jackass, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s happy.</p><p>\u201cOh, you think this is funny?\u201d I ask and she lifts her head up, wiping tears from her eyes, nodding. \u201cBecause I can get you easily.\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head, still smiling. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that much about me Kayden, so I\u2019m not too worried. Besides, I already told you I haven\u2019t done much of anything.\u201d</p><p>I lean toward her, putting my lips next to her ear, tucking her hair out of the way. \u201cI\u2019ve never made out in the rain and had one of the best kisses of my life.\u201d I\u2019m fucking drunk and admitting more than I normally would, but my drunken mind doesn\u2019t care at the moment.</p><p>She shivers from my breath, her shoulders shuddering upward. \u201cBut you have, haven\u2019t you? Or maybe you haven\u2019t. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it when you ramble. It\u2019s cute.\u201d I put the bottle to my lips and slant my head back, sipping a shot, letting her know my answer. I aim the bottle in her direction with my gaze on her. \u201cYour turn, unless it\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers tremble as she wraps her hand around the bottle. I watch her mouth move as she inclines her head back and takes a deep swallow. I probably shouldn\u2019t be staring, but watching her lips move is distracting and turning me on.</p><p>She coughs, her cheeks puffing out as she places the bottle on the table and smears the sleeve of her shirt across her lips. \u201cGod, it burns so bad.\u201d</p><p>Luke collects the bottle from the table and gets to his feet. \u201cI have to fucking take a piss.\u201d He opens the door of the basement and staggers outside, leaving it cracked behind him.</p><p>Callie looks at me bewilderedly. \u201cWhy did he go outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a drunk thing with him.\u201d I relax back on the couch with my arm still around her. \u201cHe likes to go outside and piss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going to be okay?\u201d Callie tucks her leg underneath her. \u201cHe seems pretty drunk. What if he wanders out into the trees and gets lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I wave her off, not wanting to talk about Luke anymore.</p><p>We sit quietly for a moment and I watch her out of the corner of my eye, wanting to touch her so badly, like I did earlier in her room.</p><p>Callie rotates her body toward me, pressing her lips together, restraining a smile. \u201cSo you really made Tami Bentler a yes or no letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me clarify that that happened in third grade.\u201d I relax on the couch, grab her shoulder, and guide her down beside me, so we\u2019re lying side by side and I wrap my legs around hers.</p><p>She bumps her head on the arm of the chair as she gets situated. \u201cOw... what did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere lift your head up.\u201d I tuck my arm under her, before she lies down, letting her use it as a pillow. \u201cShe said no way.\u201d</p><p>She turns on her side, facing me. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad. I would have said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have?\u201d I question. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t as charming as I am now.\u201d</p><p>She chokes on a laugh and then lowers her head toward my chest. \u201cI kind of had a crush on you back in grade school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Fixing a finger under her chin, I elevate her head, so I can look into her eyes. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you know that almost every girl did, which makes me surprised Tami said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Tami may have taken the letter better if it was from someone like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean... she liked\u2014likes girls?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, staring up at the ceiling. \u201cThat\u2019s what I heard, but who knows if it\u2019s true.\u201d I pause, glancing down at her as she wets her lips with her tongue. \u201cHow drunk are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not drunk at all,\u201d she says. \u201cI had two tiny swallows.\u201d</p><p>I pinch her side and she cradles her arm against her ribs protectively. \u201cYeah, but you\u2019re tiny and a lightweight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that tiny,\u201d she protests. \u201cAnd I promise I barely feel a thing.\u201d</p><p>I pause, examining her eyes, and then move forward with caution. \u201cSo if I kissed you right now, I wouldn\u2019t be taking advantage of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I might be taking advantage of you. Your breath smells about as bad as the bottle.\u201d She fans her nose with a smile.</p><p>\u201cTrust me. You can take advantage of me and I won\u2019t mind, even when I sober up.\u201d I press my lips to hers, feeling my heart thump in my chest as her breath catches.</p><p>It grows silent as we lie with our foreheads touching and our breaths mingling. I place my hand on her hip, shutting my eyes, feeling the intensity of the moment like an open wound.</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d Callie whispers. \u201cHow many people saw Luke walking in that robe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how every Christmas they do that caroling thing down in the town center?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he walked through there.\u201d</p><p>She laughs, rolling in to me, and nestling her face into my shoulder as her leg slides across my stomach. \u201cThere are always a ton of people there. Oh, my God, I bet my parents were even there. They always go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...\u201d I smell the scent of her hair; shampoo mixed with cigarettes from Luke smoking in the car on our way here. \u201cCallie, I....\u201d Fucking hell. What the hell is happening to me? \u201cI really want to kiss you right now.\u201d</p><p>She freezes, her chest grazing against mine as she exhales. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>I sweep her hair out of her face and she peers up at me through her long eyelashes. \u201cCan I?\u201d</p><p>She stays motionless for a second and then nods her head. \u201cYeah, you can.\u201d</p><p>I let out a tense breath and lean toward her, tipping my head to the side as I seal my mouth to hers. Nipping softly on her bottom lip, she lets out a breathy moan that floods my body with a hunger. I dive into the kiss, opening my mouth and caressing her lips with my tongue. She\u2019s warm and tastes like Jack and I want more\u2014more than we\u2019re probably ready for.</p><p>Grabbing her waist, I pull her onto my lap so she\u2019s straddling me. \u201cI can\u2019t stop myself with you.\u201d</p><p>A tiny gasp escapes her lips as my hard cock presses against her. \u201cKayden...\u201d she starts, but trails off as I knot my fingers through her hair and escort her face toward mine. Moving my lips down her neck, I suck on her skin, devouring the taste of her.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d The back of my mind screams at me that I need to shut up. That I\u2019m drunk and what I\u2019m going to say isn\u2019t good, but I do it anyway. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way about anyone before.\u201d</p><p>Her body goes rigid, her breath feathering against my neck. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me... I like it so much. I\u2019ve never liked the idea of being with anyone before.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling slowly, she pushes upward and climbs off the top of me. \u201cI think maybe we should talk about something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve scared her, like I\u2019ve done with myself.</p><p>\u201cLike something that makes you happy,\u201d she suggests. \u201cOr something that you\u2019re not going to regret in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s you. Callie, you\u2019re the only person that\u2019s ever made me feel happy about anything. That night you saved me, you changed something in me\u2014you made me want to live.\u201d I tell her the truth, knowing that when morning comes around, it\u2019s all going to catch up with me.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>#21 Create Memories That Belong to You</p><p>Callie</p><p>Last night was interesting to say the least. Kayden was drunk and saying things to me he probably wouldn\u2019t in a sober state, so I stopped it. I don\u2019t want him telling me things just because he\u2019s drunk. I\u2019ve seen Seth ramble on about nonsense way too many times and he never means most of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I end up falling asleep on the bed in the corner and when I wake up, I have an, \u201coh shit\u201d moment. My phone is beeping with a thousand messages from my mom. I don\u2019t even bother checking any of them. I spring up from the bed and hurry over to the couch where Kayden is lying on his side with his eyes shut and his arm draped over his face.</p><p>I glance over my shoulder at Luke, sleeping on the floor with his head on a pillow and then crouch down in front of Kayden. \u201cWake up. I need a ride home.\u201d</p><p>He breathes quietly, his chest lifting and falling, so I place a hand on his cheek, running my thumb along the scar below his eye. \u201cKayden, please wake up. My mom is freaking out.\u201d</p><p>His eyelids lift, his pupils shriveling as the light hits them, and it looks like he wasn\u2019t even asleep. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p> <p>I check my cell phone screen. \u201cAlmost eleven. Were you awake the whole time?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, sitting up and stretching his arms above his head. His shirt rides up and I try not to stare. \u201cI\u2019ve been awake for a while. Thinking about stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I straighten my legs and search the room for my jacket. \u201cCan you give me a ride? Or should I wake up Luke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be walking into dangerous territory,\u201d he says, getting up from the sofa. \u201cLuke is not a morning person.\u201d</p><p>I slip my arms through the sleeves of my jacket. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember falling asleep. One minute, we were talking and the next, I\u2019m waking up in the bed.\u201d</p> <p>He smiles, grabbing Luke\u2019s keys off the coffee table. \u201cI think you did that in your sleep. You were lying by me and then you got up and wandered off over there. You looked pretty out of it.\u201d</p><p>He opens the back door and we step out into the cold afternoon air. The sky is a light blue with a haze covering spots and I can see the pool house to my left. Kayden shuts the door and we start across the grass silently. I don\u2019t know what to say. I feel awkward carrying around his words that he doesn\u2019t remember.</p><p>He stops suddenly at the corner of the house and rakes his hands through his messy hair. \u201cI remember it.\u201d</p><p>I peer over my shoulder at him. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He takes a few tentative steps toward me. \u201cI wasn\u2019t that drunk. I remember what I said. I\u2019ve been lying on the couch for practically half the night trying to figure out what the fuck to say to you when we were both awake.\u201d</p><p>I blow out a breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain. I\u2019ve been around Seth enough that I know how the day after goes. Trust me, he\u2019s done and said so many things that he regrets.\u201d</p> <p>He shakes his head, with a quizzical look on his face. \u201cBut I don\u2019t regret it. I just... I just don\u2019t know how to handle it. When I said I felt things for you that I never have, I meant it and it fucking scares me, especially because there are still a lot of things you don\u2019t know about me\u2014bad things.\u201d</p><p>I close the gap between us. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. I don\u2019t believe that there are bad things about you. Only things that you think are bad.\u201d</p><p>Massaging the back of his neck, he looks out at the road behind me. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be saying that if you knew what the stuff was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always tell me,\u201d I suggest. \u201cAnd let me be the judge of it.\u201d</p><p>He locks eyes with me. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like me if you knew.\u201d</p><p>I summon a deep breath, ready to say something that terrifies me. \u201cFor the last six years, I\u2019ve been afraid of almost everyone except Seth, but he and I shared this connection and I trusted him fairly quickly. It was the same with you. That day we went up to the cliff, it might have seemed like I was terrified\u2014which I was\u2014but just going there with you and letting you help me get up onto that cliff was a huge step for me. I trusted you and that means something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI do, but I don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me about your dad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but this is different. This is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the fuck have you been?\u201d Kayden\u2019s dad comes storming around the corner, dressed in a navy blue sweat suit, his face bright red, and his hands forming fists. \u201cYou were supposed to go...\u201d He trails off when he sees me standing by Kayden. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>I grab Kayden\u2019s hand automatically. \u201cCallie Lawrence.\u201d</p><p>Recollection surfaces in his irate expression. \u201cOh, you\u2019re Coach Lawrence\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ve met a few times.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me for a while, like he\u2019s trying to force me to cower back. Finally he fixes his gaze on Kayden. \u201cWe were supposed to be working out this morning. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Kayden\u2019s hand tightens around mine. \u201cYeah, sorry. I overslept and I have to take her home, so I can\u2019t go yet.\u201d</p><p>He opens and closes his hands and a vein in his neck bulges. \u201cHow long are you going to be?\u201d</p><p>Kayden shrugs. \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe thirty minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Owens glances at me, appearing annoyed. \u201cWhy can\u2019t she drive herself home? We have a schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you have a schedule,\u201d Kayden says and then tenses as his dad\u2019s face contorts with aggravation. \u201cYou just think I\u2019m supposed to follow along with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, are you talking to me?\u201d The intimidation he sends off is terrifying as hell and I want to dive behind Kayden and hide. \u201cBecause I think you\u2019re forgetting the rules here and what the consequences are for forgetting the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d Kayden\u2019s breath is ragged as he strengthens his grip on my hand and walks around his dad, towing me with him.</p><p>\u201cKayden Owens,\u201d he calls out. \u201cYou better not be walking away from me.\u201d</p><p>Kayden and I dash toward the truck parked in the driveway beneath the trees.</p><p>\u201cGod fucking dammit!\u201d his dad yells after us.</p><p>Kayden helps me in the truck, then jumps into the driver\u2019s side and starts up the engine. From the middle of the yard, his dad watches us with a dark look masking his face. My mind goes back to that awful night and what that man can do.</p><p>The tires spin as we hit the road and Kayden shifts the truck into a higher gear, the trees on the sides of the road blurring by. An elongated pause passes before Kayden speaks.</p><p>\u201cCan you text Luke?\u201d He hands me his cell phone. \u201cAnd tell him to just hang out downstairs until I get back?\u201d</p><p>I nod, taking his phone, and scroll through his contacts until I find Luke\u2019s name. \u201cDo you think he\u2019ll go down and yell at Luke?\u201d I ask as I send the message.</p><p>He shakes his head, his fingers tightening around the wheel. \u201cHe only does it to his kids.\u201d</p><p>I set the phone on the dash and scoot across the seat toward him. \u201cKayden, I don\u2019t think you should go back there. What if he does something to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t handle.\u201d His voice is sharp and I recoil, starting to slide back across the seat. \u201cNo, stop.\u201d He quickly places his hand on my thigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have snapped at you like that. It\u2019s just that, it\u2019s what I do. I\u2019ve been dealing with it forever. It\u2019s my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, make it so it\u2019s not your life anymore,\u201d I say, my voice taking on a pleading tone.</p><p>He turns toward me with doubt in his eyes, like that isn\u2019t an option. \u201cAnd what am I going to do? Never go back? As fucking messed up as he is, he\u2019s still my father. That house is where I grew up\u2014it\u2019s my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be any more. Just leave,\u201d I say, trying to understand what I need to say to convince him. \u201cCome stay with me. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated like that. There\u2019s so much good in you and you deserve better.\u201d My voice tremors. \u201cPlease, please, just come stay with me.\u201d</p><p>He swallows hard, his eyes widening. \u201cYou would let me do that?\u201d</p><p>I nod my head, my heart aching for him as I reach out and touch his arm. \u201cOf course. I don\u2019t want you to go back to him. He\u2019s... why is he like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s how his father was with him.\u201d He steers the truck toward my road. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite as bad when we were younger, although it still fucking sucked. He would just get mad at things and yell and sometimes slap us or hit us with the belt. It got worse as we got older, like he knew he could....\u201d He grinds his teeth. \u201cHit us harder without killing us. My brothers fought back when they got old enough, but when they moved out... and I was alone... Things just kind of fell apart. All his anger was kind of focused on me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes burn as I blink several times to stop my tears from pouring out, thinking about him alone in that house with that God-awful man. \u201cDon\u2019t live with it anymore. Come stay with me. You don\u2019t need to be there.\u201d</p><p>As his eyes search mine, he looks terrified, confused, and kind of like a lost little boy. \u201cOkay, but I have to go pick up Luke.\u201d</p><p>I can breathe again, my lungs relaxing as the airflow returns to them. \u201cYou\u2019ll come right back, though? Promise?\u201d</p><p>He nods as he turns the truck into my driveway, parking it behind my mom\u2019s car. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the window by the back door, where the curtain is pulled back and my mom is peering out. \u201cDo you want me to go back with you? I just need to tell her.\u201d</p><p>Kayden cups my cheek and rubs the pad of his thumb beneath my eye. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay. You stay here and try to calm your mom down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Maybe I should get my dad to drive over with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie, I\u2019ll be fine. Luke\u2019s there. I\u2019m just going to grab my stuff and then come over. Nothing will happen.\u201d</p><p>My heart knots as I lean over and brush my lips against his. I start to pull away, but he slides his hand to the back of my neck and presses his mouth to mine again, kissing me fiercely, before releasing me. With a heavy feeling in my heart, I climb out of the car and watch him back away, knowing I\u2019ll be holding my breath until he returns.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>I\u2019m scared shitless. I\u2019ve never talked back to my dad like that and the look in his eyes told me I was screwed, but Callie is right. I don\u2019t have to deal with it anymore. All I have to do is walk away. Something I should have realized a long time ago, but for some reason I just couldn\u2019t. All I\u2019ve ever seen in my life, is people leaving, not caring hitting, yelling, telling me to suck it up. But then Callie comes along and tells me I can change it\u2014that I deserve so much better. It\u2019s so simple yet her words mean so much to me.</p><p>I park the truck behind the tree and send Luke a text to meet me out at his truck in ten minutes, because I need to get my bag. Memories haunt my mind as I walk up the front porch. The atmosphere is dead silent and the front door is agape.</p><p>Putting my guard up, I step inside the house. When I was younger, my dad liked to make a game out of the beatings. He would give us time to hide and then he would come searching for us. If we hid well enough, we\u2019d win. If not, we\u2019d pay. We always ended up paying because he\u2019d never give up looking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The house seems empty so I hurry up the stairway to my room and toss my clothes into the bag. Swinging it over my shoulder, I trot downstairs, feeling freedom waiting for me as the front door emerges into view. But my dad steps out from beneath the stairway, and stands at the bottom, blocking my path.</p><p>He crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if it was the girl that made you act so stupid or if you\u2019ve just gotten dumber since you went away to college? You never really were bright.\u201d</p><p>My mind calculates my options. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m not going to stay here anymore. I just...\u201d I tread down to the step below.</p><p>He inches to the side, getting in my path. \u201cYou have a workout to make up for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d I say, my palms sweating. This is the farthest I\u2019ve ever pushed him. \u201cI work out enough at school.\u201d My foot moves down another step and I\u2019m right in his face. \u201cI\u2019m going to go.\u201d</p><p>He seizes my arm, squeezing it so firmly the skin burns. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get your fucking ass in that God damn car and we\u2019re going to go down to the field to work out. You will not push me anymore.\u201d</p><p>I think of Callie sitting back at her house, waiting for me; actually worrying about me. No one has ever worried about me before. I jerk my arm out of his grip and shove my hands against his chest, shaking with the fear of a three-year-old. Taking the opportunity, I jump down the rest of the steps, but he regains his balance, and comes at me with his fists up and uncontrollable anger in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou fucking piece of shit!\u201d he yells, taking a hit at my face.</p><p>I duck my head and his hand slams through the window of the front door, shattering the glass and splitting his knuckles. It doesn\u2019t faze him and he rams another jab at me and his fist connects with my jaw. Bones pop and my ears ring.</p> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d I clutch my face as pain explodes up my cheek, but I\u2019m used to pain enough that I shake it off. For the first time in my life, I take a swing at him. My knuckles pop as he ducks and my hand smashes into the wooden banister.</p><p>Seconds later, I\u2019m being tackled to the ground, his arms wrapping around me as he throws us both to the floor. Glass stabs through my shirt and into my muscles as I kick my father in the gut. He slides across the floor, bumping his head into the wall, and I throw my hands up in the air as I scramble to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d I say and before he can get up, I run out the door.</p><p>Luke is waiting in the truck with the engine running. I don\u2019t look back until I\u2019m safely in the cab and the door is shut. Luke\u2019s eyes are bulging as he assesses the glass stuck in my skin, the tears in my shirt, and my cheek that\u2019s swollen double its size.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s still doing that shit?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as my dad walks out onto the front porch, eyeing the truck. \u201cJust drive. Take me to Callie\u2019s. I don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p> <p>He reverses the truck onto the main road and I support my injured hand against my chest, keeping my eyes on my father until he disappears out of my sight.</p><p>Callie</p><p>I can\u2019t sit still. I keep sending him texts, but he won\u2019t answer. My mom gave me a very long lecture about how worried she was that I was gone all night. I let her ramble on, wondering how concerned she\u2019d be if I told her my secret.</p><p>After she\u2019s finished, I wait for Kayden in my room above the garage. I feel sticky from last night, like alcohol is coming out of my pores, so I take a shower. Wrapping a towel around me, I comb my fingers through my hair and walk out into the bedroom to get dressed.</p><p>Kayden\u2019s sitting on my bed with his back turned to me, his shoulders slouched over, and I leap back, surprised. \u201cOh.\u201d I cover my mouth with my hand, stepping toward the door, embarrassed I\u2019m only in a towel.</p><p>He turns his head to look at me, and I no longer care. His cheek is puffy and red, he has blood and slashes on his shirt, and his knuckles are coated with dry blood.</p><p>Securing the towel in a knot, I rush over to him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his eyes skimming my barely covered body. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore. It\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>He holds his hand out toward me, which is trembling. \u201cI tried to hit him and then I kicked him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad?\u201d I ask. \u201cDid he... are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am now.\u201d He grabs my hips, shuts his eyes and breathes through gritted teeth as he pulls me onto his lap. My lips part in protest as the bottom of the towel opens up and the roughness of his jeans touches my bare skin, but he rests his head on my shoulder and his body starts to tremble. I fasten my jaw shut, close my eyes, and smooth my hand over his hair, fighting back the tears.</p><p>I remain motionless, afraid to move, as he struggles for air. After what seems like hours, he lifts his head and his eyes are red.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says, blowing out a breath as he rubs the palm of his hand against his eye. \u201cIt all just caught up with me for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand completely,\u201d I tell him and kiss his forehead.</p><p>His fingers seek my cheek and he traces a line across my birthmark on my temple. \u201cI\u2019ve never stood up to him before. It was fucking terrifying.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s so much braver than me; standing up to something that\u2019s haunted him since he was a kid. I envy him for it.</p><p>I lightly stroke his injured cheek and he flinches. \u201cDo you want me to get you some ice? Bandages? Pain killers? My mom has a ton of them in her medicine cabinet.\u201d</p><p>He crooks an eyebrow at me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cI asked her once and she said they were from an old cheerleading injury back in high school.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows knit and his swollen eye closes. \u201cWasn\u2019t that like twenty years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s crazy,\u201d I say, starting to climb off his lap. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why she\u2019s happy all the time.\u201d</p><p>His fingertips press into my hips, securing me in place and there is panic in his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to let you go.\u201d</p><p>I know that look; the one that begs for someone to help them.</p><p>\u201cPlease help me, Mommy,\u201d I whisper as I feel him shift above me and every single part of my body feels like it\u2019s ripping in two. He covers my mouth with his hand roughly, and tears slip from my eyes. Where is she? Why doesn\u2019t she come get me? Because she thinks I\u2019m hiding, like the rest of the kids are. That\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to be doing, instead of dying on the inside, although part of me wishes I were dying on the outside too.</p><p>Please Mommy....</p><p>I wrap my arms around his neck and hug him as he burrows his face into my neck, resting his lips against my racing pulse. Shutting my eyes, I breathe through the moment; scared to death, but overwhelmingly wanting it. He kisses my neck slowly, relishing each touch, and my head drifts to the side.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to go wash the blood off my hands,\u201d he whispers and I lean away. \u201cJust stay right here, okay?\u201d</p><p>Gathering the bottom of the towel, I nod, and slide my legs off his lap. He gets up and heads to the bathroom while I lay down on the bed, knowing something\u2019s about to happen. I can feel it in the air, in the warm sensation on my neck where he kissed me, and everywhere his hands touched me.</p><p>When he walks out of the bathroom, his shirt is off and he has a towel pressed to his broad chest. When he climbs on the bed, I sit up and lower his hand holding the towel so I can look at the cut. It\u2019s deep and just across his upper rib; another scar to add to his already torn body. I run my finger up his forearms, noticing the fresh wounds on his skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened with these?\u201d I stop on a cut near his bicep and study it. \u201cIt looks like someone was cutting your skin.\u201d</p><p>His fingers enclose around mine and he shakes his head, looking at the wall. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I promise, Callie. This is the stuff I can handle.\u201d</p><p>I rise to my knees, feeling the towel open at the bottom, but don\u2019t bother to close it. I graze my lips to his chest, inching up his neck along a jagged scar. I suck on his skin, run my tongue gently along it, and then engulf the softness of his lips. His head slants to the side and our mouths connect as his fingers envelop around my waist. He lures me closer to him, parting his lips and sucking my tongue into his mouth. I let out a groan as the overpowering emotions burst through me and possess me, erasing away the internal pain.</p><p>His fingers find the bottom of the towel, and he touches the bare skin of my waist. I can\u2019t think straight as he feels my body, tastes my lips, and steals my torturous thoughts away momentarily. I sit up, pressing my chest against him and he shifts his weight, lying down on the bed. Our legs entwine and his knee slides between my thighs. The feel of the fabric of his jeans sends heat through my body that coils into my stomach.</p><p>\u201cKayden,\u201d I moan against his lips as I dig my nails into his shoulder blades.</p><p>He inches his mouth away, breathing fitfully, his eyes assessing mine. \u201cDo you want me to stop?\"</p><p>I tighten my hold on him as I shake my head, my hair falling into my eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Sucking in a breath, he crashes his lips against mine and the soft savoring kisses turn desperate as the towel unwraps from my body and I lie naked underneath him. My nipples stroke his chest with every breath and my legs fall open. My hands are on his cheeks and his warmth gives me reassurance as he reaches toward my arms and his fingers encircle my wrists. Leading my hands away from his face, he puts one on each side of my head as his tongue consumes my mouth.</p><p>Abruptly, he releases one of my arms and my body shivers beneath him. \u201cCallie, let me know if I need to stop,\u201d he breathes against my lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I whisper, my heart restless, but sure. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>His eyes open, wide and glossy, and he bites my bottom lip as his hand glides down my stomach. Seconds later, his fingers are inside me like they were yesterday. I feel high and lost but in the most amazing way. Like my mind finally left the dark place and I can grasp at the light again.</p><p>I want more. I need more, however I don\u2019t know how to ask for it.</p><p>My hips rock against his hand as he feels me from the inside, groaning against my mouth as I drag my teeth along his lip, nipping at it before releasing it. Pieces of his brown hair brush across my forehead as I move my body, needing more. His chest is heaving, as he slips his fingers out of me.</p><p>\u201cCallie, where\u2019s the line?\u201d he asks, returning his fingers to my wrist, holding me down beneath him, his eyes scanning mine. \u201cI need to know where to stop.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head from side to side, looking him in the eye. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to stop, Kayden. I said it and I mean it.\u201d</p><p>His pupils contract as he processes what I said. \u201cCallie, I...\u201d</p><p>My heart slows as the moment starts to dissolve. Images of my past catch up, but then they swiftly vanish as he lifts his hips up to unbutton his jeans and kick them off. Seconds later he\u2019s out of his clothes and has a condom on. He lies back on top of me, bare skin to bare skin, and he kisses me with passion, desire, everything, as he entangles our arms together above my head. My nerves mix with my anticipation and I feel every single aspect of the moment. The roughness of his skin on his palms, the smoothness of his chest as it touches mine, the wetness of his tongue inside my mouth, the tingling all over my body. Sweat beads my skin as my body heats with want and I open my legs up as his body forms with mine. When he inches into me, I feel the pain, but I also feel the invisible chains around my wrists break and shatter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sucks in a breath as my legs constrict around his hips and he gradually eases farther into me. He moves his lips away from my mouth and looks into my eyes while caressing his fingers across my cheek. Then, he pauses, before giving one last rock until he\u2019s completely inside me.</p><p>Every part of my body and mind open up as he kisses me. It burns at first as he moves back and forth, and I almost cry out for him to stop, but the pain subsides and my muscles unravel as my head falls back against the pillow.</p><p>It\u2019s a moment I\u2019ll remember forever, because it belongs to me.</p><p>Kayden</p> <p>I have never been so fucking terrified in my life. Not when I was being yelled at, beaten, or even when I stood up to my dad. I\u2019ve had sex before, plenty of times. It was all for fun, even with Daisy. There was nothing there; I thought it was supposed to be that way. As Callie looks up at me, trusting me, I\u2019m lost. No one has ever looked at me like that before; no one has ever made me feel the way I feel at this moment. It\u2019s like every one of my scars has ruptured and the pain is real, but I can\u2019t stop.</p><p>I kiss her fiercely, moving her arms above her head as I thrust inside her. It feels so good and I never want it to stop. Her eyes are glossed over and her pupils dilate as her lips part. Her neck arches as she gasps in pleasure and she bucks her hips against my movements. I let go of her arms and my palms scan downward to her breasts, feeling her skin as I suck on her neck. Her fingers sketch each scar, leaving a path of heat everywhere she touches and it nearly drives me crazy. Her back bows up as she cries out and moments later, I join her, knowing I can never go back from this. The way I feel is irreversible; overtaken, wanted, needed, connected. I\u2019ll never be able to let it go.</p><p>As we catch our breaths, I tell myself that it will be okay; that I can handle it and for an instant, it feels like I can.</p><p>I let out an uneven breath as I slip out of her and roll onto my back, tugging my hands through my hair. Rotating on her hip, her warm body follows mine. She rests her cheek against my chest, gliding her leg over my waist.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I finally dare ask her, fighting through my own racing thoughts.</p> <p>She nods, sketching the lines of my stomach muscles with her pinkie. \u201cI\u2019m more than okay.\u201d</p><p>I shut my eyes and put my chin on top of her head. \u201cCallie, there\u2019s something I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>She lifts her face away from my chest and peers up at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did I... did I do something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I touch the tip of my finger to the bottom of her lip. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not you. It\u2019s me. There are things about me that you don\u2019t know and I think I need to tell you.\u201d</p><p>She sits up and my gaze drifts to her body, so fragile, just like her heart. \u201cYou\u2019re making me nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I back out as feelings of shame rush over me. \u201cI\u2019m just stuck in my own head.\u201d</p> <p>She frowns. \u201cKayden, you can tell me anything. There\u2019s no judgment here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d I say with honesty as my hands grip her waist possessively. Lifting her up, I set her down on top of me, so one of her legs is on each side of my hip. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it, but a little bit later.\u201d</p><p>Wetting my lips with my tongue, I cup the back of her head and bring her mouth toward mine, as I slide my other hand up the front of her, gripping at her breast, wanting to go back and relive the only peaceful moment I\u2019ve had in my life.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>#33 Lay With Someone, Motionless, Just Feeling Each Other.</p><p>Callie</p><p>\u201cI think I have to go inside,\u201d I say, checking the seventh message my mom has sent me. \u201cOtherwise, she\u2019s going to come out here and see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d he questions innocently as he flips me over so he\u2019s above me and he takes my breast into his mouth, tracing circles over my nipple with the tip of his tongue.</p> <p>I gasp as my thighs ache for him to be inside me again. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get me caught up again.\u201d</p><p>He leans away with a smile on his face, but his cheek is red and puffy. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>I fake a stern look. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. She\u2019ll come out here with her key and open the door to this.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, still not fully believing me, but frees me from his arms. \u201cFine, you win. I\u2019ll let you go, but we\u2019re coming right back as soon as you deal with your mother.\u201d</p><p>I laugh softly as I wrap the sheet around me and pad over to my bag to take some clothes out. I feel a little shy even after what we did. I manage to put my clothes on before I let the sheet go. He doesn\u2019t question what I\u2019m doing as he gets up and puts his jeans and shirt back on.</p><p>I glance out the window at the dark sky. Everything seems perfect, untouchable, like I\u2019m holding my life in my own hands for once. \u201cHow late is it?\u201d</p><p>He turns his arm and checks his watch. \u201cLike seven thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder she\u2019s freaking out. I missed dinner.\u201d</p><p>He laces his fingers through mine as I open the door. \u201cSo how bad is this going to be?\u201d</p><p>I lead him down the steps behind me. \u201cShe\u2019s going to ask you a thousand questions and be super cheerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll yammer about football, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>My phone beeps and I pause at the bottom of the steps to check the message.</p><p>\u201cIs it another one from your mom?\u201d he wonders and I shake my head.</p><p>Seth: Hey, darling. How\u2019s it going? Good I hope. Did you eat some delicious treats?</p><p>Me: Maybe... But what kind of treats r u talking about?</p><p>Seth: OMFG!!! Did u? Because I had this really weird feeling that you did.</p><p>Me: Did what?\u201d</p><p>Seth: U know what.</p><p>I glance up at Kayden, who laughs at me, his eyes crinkling at the corners. \u201cIt\u2019s from Seth.\u201d</p><p>He leans over to get a better look and I cover the screen with my hand. \u201cAre you talking about me?\u201d</p><p>I bite at my lip, feeling my cheeks warm. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he says proudly. \u201cEven after that, I can still make you blush. God, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>I lower my head, allowing my hair to veil my face. \u201cI\u2019m not blushing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou so are.\u201d He hooks a finger under my chin and tips my face up. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad.\u201d He brushes his lips lightly across mine, giving me a soft kiss that I feel all the way to my toes.</p><p>I pull away, smiling, but pause when I catch sight of the extra car in the driveway. \u201cWhose car is that?\u201d</p><p>Kayden tracks my gaze and shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>Confused, I push open the back door. Seconds later, it all leaves me; every breath, every heartbeat, every kiss, every moment of my own. Black spots pop across my vision as I take in my brother, Jackson, sitting at the table, wolfing a piece of pie straight out of the tin. Across from him sits his best friend Caleb Miller. He\u2019s flipping through a magazine, his dark hair scraggily and long, like he hasn\u2019t had a haircut in years. When he glances up my gaze instinctively shoots to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t little Miss Callie all grown up,\u201d Caleb says and I stare at the pencil on the table in front of him, envisioning what it would be like to stab him in the eye multiple times and inflict as much pain as possible.</p><p>\u201cMom thought you ran away,\u201d Jackson says, licking the whip cream off the fork. \u201cShe texted you a thousand times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood for her,\u201d I snap. I\u2019ve always had this bitter hatred toward my brother for bringing that asshole around. I know he didn\u2019t know, but I can\u2019t turn it off. \u201cCan you tell her that we stopped by and that I\u2019m okay so she can stop texting?\"</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jackson says. \u201cI\u2019m not your messenger. She\u2019s just in the living room. Go tell her yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you even here?\u201d I ask and Kayden\u2019s finger grazes the inside of my wrist. I blink at him. I\u2019d almost forgotten he was there.</p><p>Kayden shakes his head, and his emerald eyes convey something I don\u2019t like. He can see it\u2014sense it\u2014hidden deep beneath the surface of my skin.</p><p>Caleb rises up from the table and heads across the kitchen, his movements unhurried like he doesn\u2019t have a care in the world. \u201cSo how\u2019s college football?\u201d he says to Kayden. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a lot more intense at that level.\u201d</p><p>Kayden doesn\u2019t take his eyes off me. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. You just have to be tough enough to make it.\u201d</p><p>Caleb eyes Kayden\u2019s inflamed cheek with a sadistic look in his expression as he opens the cupboard. \u201cYeah, you look pretty tough. Nice shiner by the way.\u201d</p><p>Kayden gives him a cold, hard stare, his fingers wrapping inward into his palms. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get kicked out of college for selling pot on campus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I had to make a living,\u201d Caleb says, slamming the cupboard shut. \u201cNot everyone has daddy\u2019s money and a scholarship to live off of.\u201d</p><p>Kayden\u2019s jaw tenses and I jerk on his arm. \u201cCan we go?\u201d</p><p>He nods, backing toward the door with my hand in his and his eyes boring into Caleb, who\u2019s growing uneasy.</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Jackson says to me. \u201cYou are not leaving me here to be smothered by mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be in Florida or whatever?\u201d I ask with rage and unsteadiness in my voice. \u201cYou weren\u2019t supposed to be here.\u201d</p><p>He messes with his hair as he gets up from the kitchen table with the pie tin in his hand. \u201cWe had a last minute change of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have to work?\u201d I ask derisively. \u201cOr did you just quit another job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a fucking job, Callie.\u201d He tosses the tin into the kitchen sink and glares at me. \u201cSo quit being a cunt. I don\u2019t know why you always have to talk to me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Kayden steps in on my behalf, moving in front of me. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking call her names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call her whatever I want,\u201d Jackson retorts, folding his arms over his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t know the shit she put this family through. Her little issues or whatever they are have made my mom basically crazy.\u201d</p><p>Caleb watches me with interest, waiting for me to react. I can\u2019t look away from him. I want to, but he\u2019s overpowering me because he knows what my issues are\u2014he put them there. I slowly start to die, wilt into pieces like I\u2019m a Night-Blooming Cereus, the flowers that bloom only once a year at night and die before sunrise, their lives and happiness short lived.</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone.\u201d Caleb arches his eyebrows at me with a smile surfacing at his lips. \u201cMaybe Callie has reasons for the way she acts.\u201d</p><p>Take me out of here. Take me out of here. Save me. Save me. Save me.</p><p>Suddenly, my legs are moving and I\u2019m being dragged somewhere. The back door swings open and I\u2019m hauled down the stairs into the center of the driveway.</p><p>Standing at the bottom of the stairs and in the light of the porch, Kayden observes me with uncertainty in his eyes, his hands on my shoulders. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You have this look in your eyes...\u201d</p><p>I let out a strangled breath. \u201cI don\u2019t like my brother very much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The muscles in his neck move as he swallows hard. \u201cCallie, I know what fear is. Trust me. I\u2019ve seen it on my brothers\u2019 faces, felt it many times. You\u2019re afraid of him. I can see it in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid of my brother?\u201d I play dumb, praying to God he won\u2019t find out, fearing what will happen if he does.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d he says sternly, placing his hand on my cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of Caleb. He was... he was the one who did it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I don\u2019t even mean to say it, it just falls out into the world. I stare at him, listening to my heart thump inside my chest, to the wind sing, to the sound of someone breaking somewhere in the world.</p> <p>He forces a lump down in his throat. \u201cCallie... I... you need to tell someone. You can\u2019t let him keep going around living his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Too much time has gone by and even the cops can\u2019t do anything about it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, feeling detached from the world. \u201cBecause I looked into it once to see\u2014to know that I no longer have any options. What\u2019s done is done.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head, his jaw set tight. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither is your life,\u201d I say, wanting my moment back. I want it back. Please, God, give me it back. \u201dNothing really is.\u201d</p><p>Silence builds and it all crumbles out as I collapse into his chest, tears spilling out as the secret I\u2019ve carried with me breaks into lighter pieces. He scoops me up against my protests and cradles me against him as he carries me up the stairs and into the room as I sob out every tear I\u2019ve been holding inside me.</p><p>He lies down on the bed with me and I bury my face into his chest. Somehow, I stop crying and we lie, unmoving, feeling each other\u2019s pain. Eventually I fall asleep in his arms.</p><p>Kayden</p><p>After she falls asleep, I watch her breathe in and out, trying to make sense of the world. Rage washes through me like a fucking wave crashing against the shore. I want to kill Caleb. Beat him to death in the most painful ways.</p><p>When I hear her brother and Caleb leave the house, laughing as they get in the car and drive away, talking about going to a party, something snaps inside me. All the rage I\u2019ve channeled ruptures and suddenly I know what I have to do.</p> <p>Callie saved me that night from a fight that would have probably left me dead, but she also saved me from myself. Before her, I was dying inside; there was nothing in my heart, but an empty hole.</p><p>Gently slipping my arm out from beneath her head, I grab my phone and sneak out the door, looking at her one last time before I leave. Trotting down the steps, I text Luke to come pick me up, then I start walking down the sidewalk away from her house toward the unknown.</p><p>I walk a ways in a direction I\u2019ve never been, letting the cold air consume me. About fifteen minutes later, Luke\u2019s truck pulls up to the curb. I hop in, rubbing my hands together as the heater blasts against my skin.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s up with the totally random fucking message?\u201d He adjusts his beanie lower on his head and cranks up the heater. \u201cYou do realize I was about to get lucky with Kelly Anallo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I mutter. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown at the lake.\u201d He cranks the wheel to the right and drives down a side road. \u201cThere was a party going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to see Callie\u2019s brother and Caleb Miller down there, did you?\u201d</p><p>He halts at a stop sign, cranking up the defroster as the windshield fogs up. \u201cYeah, they pulled up right as I left to come get you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen drive down there.\u201d I motion my hand for him to drive. \u201cI have something I need to do.\u201d</p><p>We drive in silence as I bounce my knee and drum my fingers against the door. The truck bounces as we weave through the trees and surface out the other end. When we pull up, I spot Caleb by the bonfire near the shoreline, chatting it up with some blond chick wearing a baggy jacket over a tight pink dress.</p><p>\u201cI need your help with something,\u201d I say as Luke shifts the car into park and starts to get out of the car.</p><p>He pauses with his leg outside. \u201cWhat\u2019s up? You\u2019re acting kind of weird... it\u2019s freaking me out a little.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t take my eyes off Caleb. He\u2019s shorter than me by an inch or two, but I remember him picking a few fights at parties and he can definitely hold up his own. \u201cI need you to have my back.\u201d</p><p>Luke gapes at me as he puts a cigarette in his mouth. \u201cAre you planning on picking a fight?\u201d</p><p>I nod unwaveringly. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to make sure you don\u2019t get your dumb ass kicked?\u201d He cups his hand around his mouth and flicks the top of the lighter.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to stop me before I kill him.\u201d I flip the handle and hop out.</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d A puff of smoke rises in front of his face.</p><p>\u201cStop me before I kill him,\u201d I repeat and slam the door.</p><p>He meets me around the front, flicking the end of his cigarette, sending ashes to the ground. \u201cWhat is this about, man? You know I don\u2019t do well in reckless situations.\u201d</p><p>I pause at the end of the line of cars. \u201cIf someone you... cared about a lot got hurt in the worst way possible by someone else, what would you do?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, staring at the fire. \u201cIt depends on what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething really bad,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd it scarred them for life.\u201d</p><p>He takes a slow drag off his cigarette and then turns his head toward me. \u201cAlright, I got your back.\u201d</p><p>We hike over to the fire, the rage inside me burning as brightly as the flames. People are yelling, laughing, filling up beers from the kegger on a tailgate. There\u2019s music bumping from one of the car stereos and a lively game of beer pong is going on by the lake.</p><p>Daisy shows up in front of me with a huge grin on her face and a plastic cup in her hand. \u201cHey, party boy, I knew you\u2019d show up.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head with annoyance and step to the side. \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s taken back and presses her hand to her chest, like she\u2019s a wounded deer. \u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe realized what a bitch you are,\u201d Luke chimes in gladly and blows smoke in her face.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. You\u2019re such an asshole,\u201d she says, fanning her hand in front of her face, looking at me expectantly to defend her.</p><p>I wave her off, dodge around her, and march straight for Caleb. Weaving through the people, I step out into the open near the fire. When Caleb\u2019s eyes meet mine, his expression falls, but he doesn\u2019t budge. He knows what\u2019s coming and he waits for it like he wants it.</p><p>I step toward him and a smile curls at his lips as he starts to lurk toward me. \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing here?\u201d he asks. \u201cAnd where\u2019s pretty little Callie?\u201d</p><p>I sucker punch him in the jaw, which is where I make my mistake, but I can\u2019t take it back. The crowd gasps and the girl in the pink dress drops her cup, spilling beer onto the dirt, and she skitters to the side.</p><p>Caleb crumbles to the ground clutching onto his cheek. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d He stumbles to his feet, wiping away the blood dripping from his nose. \u201cWho do you think you are?\u201d</p><p>I swing my fist at him again without an explanation, but this time he ducks and slams his fist into my side. My ribs pop, but it\u2019s nothing compared to what I\u2019m used to, and I rebound, bringing my knee to his gut.</p><p>He coughs, hunching over as he spits blood on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking dead.\u201d</p><p>I pop my knuckles, shuffling forward to hit him again, but he jumps up and charges at me. With his head down, he rams into my stomach, knocking the wind out of me, and our shoes scuff against the dirt as we struggle to stay upright. Someone screams from the crowd and it\u2019s followed by yells as we hit the dirt.</p><p>I smash my fist into his face over and over again, seeing red, only red, like it\u2019s been bottled up inside me for years. Someone tries to pull me off, but I shove them off repeatedly. I don\u2019t know how much time lapses as I continue hitting him. Finally someone is able to get me off of him.</p><p>I shake off their hand, thinking it\u2019s Luke, but the red and blue lights flashing against the still water bring me back to reality as a police officer slaps handcuffs onto my wrists.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d a cop yells and I\u2019m shoved forward, falling on my knees into the dirt.</p><p>With my bloodstained hands behind me, I take in what I\u2019ve done. Caleb\u2019s still breathing, but his face is so engorged and bloody there are no features left. I\u2019m not sure I care, though, because when it all comes down to it, Callie got her justice.</p><p>Being in jail seemed better than going home and I refused to call my dad. In the end, one of the officers calls him, because of his highly respected status in the town. My dad\u2019s always been big on the donations, which makes people automatically think he\u2019s a great guy.</p><p>Hours later, I\u2019m in the kitchen of my house, sitting at the table. My mom went to pick up Tyler from the airport and had to take a cab, because neither of them will be sober enough to drive. It\u2019s just my dad and I in the house. Something\u2019s about to end, I just don\u2019t know what.</p><p>\u201cThis is fucking bull shit.\u201d My dad circles around the table and kicks the bottom of the counter with his boot, putting a hole in the wood. \u201cI get a call in the middle of the God damn night to bail your ass out of jail, for beating the shit out of someone.\u201d He pauses, running his finger along a small cut below his eye that was caused by our fight. \u201cYou\u2019re really on a roll today, you little shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was taught by the best,\u201d I mutter, my ribs stinging, my arm throbbing, yet somehow, I feel more content than I ever have.</p><p>He picks up a chair and throws it across the room into a shelf, breaking a vase. I don\u2019t flinch. I just trace the cracks in the table with my thumb. \u201cWhere did I go wrong with you?\u201d He stomps around the island that\u2019s in the middle of the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a fuck up since you were two.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the wall, picturing Callie\u2019s smile, the sound of her laugh, the softness of her skin.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d he shouts. \u201cGod dammit, Kayden, quit ignoring me!\u201d</p><p>I close my eyes, reliving how it felt to be inside her, touch her, kiss her all over her body, the smell of her hair.</p><p>My dad\u2019s hands slam down on the table and my eyes shoot open. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>I shove away from the table, knocking the chair to the floor. I\u2019m ready for it. As he bends his elbow back over his shoulder, swinging his fist forward, I curve mine up and slam it into his jaw. The pain stuns us both as our fists connect with each other\u2019s faces. There\u2019s a pause, where he really looks at me, like he\u2019s seeing me for the first time, before he seizes me by the shoulders and throws me against the wall.</p><p>\u201cKnock it off, you little shit!\u201d He knees me in the side and I hammer my knuckles into his cheek in retaliation.</p><p>Again, he\u2019s shocked and it takes him a moment to recuperate. All I think about is how afraid he looks, the lack of confidence in his eyes, and the unsteadiness of his posture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He grabs onto my shirt, desperate to gain control as he pushes his hand against my face, shoving me back against the cupboard. Digging my fingernails into the palms of my hands, I curve my fist upward and strike him in the side of the head, hard. He lets out a grunt as he shoves me back and I crash against the counter, banging my hip against the tile and knocking knives to the floor. I start to move forward, but he runs at me with his head down. I speed up, bending my knees to hop over the island, but he catches the bottom of my shirt and jerks me down to the floor. I fling my arm behind me, reaching for him, but he ducks down.</p><p>I feel numb. Completely dead inside as I spin around on my heels and shove my hands against his chest. He refuses to let go of me, even when he trips to the floor, and he yanks me down with him. I try to roll on top of him, but seconds later I feel something sharp pierce through my side and everything stops.</p><p>My dad rises to his feet, holding a blood-soaked knife. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you ever listen?\u201d He drops the knife onto the floor beside my feet and it clanks against the tile. His face is as white as a ghost as he backs away. \u201cYou fucking...\u201d He drags his fingers down his face, before he takes off for the front door, leaving it ajar behind him and cold air gusts in.</p><p>Every part of my body aches, like a thousand knives have been stabbed into me instead of one. Pivoting to the side, I crawl up, and lean against the counter, moving my hand away from my side. Blood coats my trembling fingers and leaks out of the hole in my shirt, filling the cracks in the tile floor below me. I shut my eyes as I fight to breathe, but the pain is winning.</p> <p>I think about Callie, what she\u2019s doing, what she\u2019ll do when she hears about what happened. It hurts, even though it\u2019s not supposed to; the thought of me leaving her, of her leaving me, of never having her again. I can\u2019t hold it in.</p><p>Reaching to my side, I pick up a knife, my hand unsteady as I put the tip to my forearm. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve done for ages to shut it off. It started when I was seven when I realized that cutting myself helped me breathe\u2014helped me live through the hell of life. It\u2019s my fucked up secret; the darkness that lives within me. With every incision into my skin, the pain begins to subside as blood covers the floor.</p><p>Callie</p><p>I wake up to an empty bed and panic erupts through my body. Where did he go? I grab my phone off the nightstand and text Kayden multiple times, but he doesn\u2019t answer. I slip my shoes on and run out the door to go look for him. I need to talk to him about last night and let him know that we need to just let it go because with him in my life, what happened with Caleb isn\u2019t as scary.</p><p>Morning is clipping over the mountains and the sky is a bright pink, but the beauty of it is very misleading compared to what\u2019s going on down below. The wind is raging, blowing in a storm and chilling the temperature.</p> <p>My father is at the kitchen table when I walk inside. His brown hair is parted to the side and he\u2019s got his tie and slacks on, ready for Thanksgiving dinner this afternoon.</p><p>When he peers up from his food, his eyebrows furrow. \u201cAre you okay? You look like you\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d I glance in the living room, before backtracking to the center of the kitchen. \u201cWhere\u2019s mom? I need to ask her if I can borrow her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s taking a shower.\u201d He stands up from the chair and drops the bowl into the sink, observing me. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve lost some weight. Make sure you eat a lot today. There\u2019s going to be a game after dinner and I want you to play this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine.\u201d I can hardly hear him as I browse through the messages on my phone, but there aren\u2019t any from Kayden. \u201cCan I borrow your car for a little bit? I promise I won\u2019t be gone for too long.\u201d</p><p>He reaches for the keys in his pocket. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? You look really upset.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I assure him, unnerved because normally he doesn\u2019t notice these things. How bad do I look? \u201cI just need to check up on a friend.\u201d</p><p>He tosses me the keys and I catch them effortlessly. \u201cWould this friend be one of my old quarterbacks?\u201d</p><p>I wrap my fingers around the keys, feeling the jagged sides cut into my palm. \u201cMom\u2019s been gossiping, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his slacks. \u201cYou know how she gets. She just wants you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am happy.\u201d And at that moment it doesn\u2019t seem like a huge lie. \u201cI just need to find someone.\u201d I turn for the door.</p><p>\u201cBe back in an hour,\u201d he calls out. \u201cYou know she\u2019s going to want your help. Your brother never came home last night. He probably stayed out all night getting drunk, so he won\u2019t be any help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I step out into the cold, feeling something hit me in the chest, but I\u2019m not sure what it is. My phone goes off in my pocket and I\u2019m surprised to see Luke\u2019s name flash on the screen.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I answer as I run down the driveway and hop into my dad\u2019s car.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he says in an anxious voice. \u201cHave you talked to Kayden at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since last night.\u201d I slam the door and start the engine, not bothering to let the defroster warm up. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he went. He just took off and I can\u2019t get a hold of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe neither.\u201d He wavers as I crane my neck and back the car onto the road, squinting to see through the frosted rear window. \u201cListen Callie, last night he did something really bad.\u201d</p><p>I align the car onto the road and shove it into drive. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got this weird call from him,\u201d he says. \u201cAsking me to pick him up. He had me take him out to the lake and he... he beat the shit out of Caleb Miller.\u201d</p><p>I press the gas pedal to the floor and the tires squeal. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, I guess, but he got arrested and his dad had to bail him out.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops. \u201cHis dad?\u201d</p><p>He pauses. \u201cYeah, his dad.\u201d</p><p>I wonder if Luke knows about Kayden\u2019s dad. \u201cI\u2019m heading over to his house right now to check up on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a few blocks away... On Mason Road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you in a few,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd Callie, be careful, his dad\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I hang up and grip the phone in my hand as I drive up the hill that leads to Kayden\u2019s house.</p><p>The two-story mansion looks huge in front of the hills, towering toward the sky. By the time I park beneath the tree, the wind has kicked up and brown leaves blow through the air, nearly shadowing the forest that surrounds the house. I hop out of the car with my heart thudding inside my chest, and sprint across the lawn and up the stairs, swinging my arms to get the leaves out of my face.</p><p>The front door is agape, swaying in the wind. When I step into the foyer, a nauseous feeling burns in my stomach. Something doesn\u2019t feel right. I glance in the living room and then call up the stairway, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>The wind is my only answer, howling at the window, blowing leaves into the house, along the hardwood floor, and slamming the door against the wall. I walk into the kitchen and turn the corner. Nothing could ever prepare me for what I see.</p><p>Time stops\u2014everything stops. A part of me dies.</p><p>Lying on the floor, in a pool of blood and a pile of knives is Kayden. His eyes are shut, his arms and legs slack, and there are fresh cuts tracking up his wrists. There\u2019s a hole in the side of his shirt, where something sharp has punctured through it. There\u2019s so much blood, but I can\u2019t tell where it\u2019s coming from\u2014it looks like everywhere.</p><p>My arms fall to my side as my knees give out and I crumple to the floor, landing on a knife. \u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d I pull at my hair, feeling the pain, and rip some of the strands out. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>I shake my head a hundred times, hoping the scene will vanish, like I hoped my twelfth birthday would. But it stays. It always stays. Tears veil my vision as I press down on one of the cuts on his wrists to stop the bleeding. His skin is so cold, like ice, like death. I move my hand to his arm, his cheek, above his heart. With an unsteady finger, I dial 911 and sputter out the details.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a pulse?\u201d the operator asks when I tell her the situation.</p><p>My heart squeezes tightly in my chest as I press my fingers to his pulse and a faint murmur bumps against them. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he breathing?\u201d</p><p>I stare at his chest, wishing for it to move\u2014praying it will move. After a while, it slightly elevates and then falls down unsteadily.</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. He is. Oh my God.\u201d I press my quivering lips together, sobbing as I hang up and wait for the ambulance. The phone falls from my hand as I run my fingers through Kayden\u2019s hair, wondering if he can sense me.</p><p>\u201cKayden, wake up,\u201d I whisper, but he\u2019s still. \u201cPlease, God, wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie... what....\u201d Luke steps up behind me.</p><p>I don\u2019t budge. I can\u2019t look away from Kayden. If I do, he might disappear.</p><p>\u201cCallie, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make a sound. It\u2019ll be over quickly. You\u2019ll barely feel a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCallie!\u201d Luke practically screams and I blink up at him as hot tears stream down my cheeks. \u201cDid you call an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>I nod, feeling everything around me\u2014in me\u2014crumble. \u201cI tried to save him... I-I did, but I couldn\u2019t... I couldn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Luke kneels down beside me, looking at his friend on the floor, his face draining of color, his brown eyes huge and horrified. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. He\u2019s breathing. He can get through this... he can.\u201d</p><p>But it is my fault. All my fault. I wrap my arms around Kayden, breathing him in, never wanting to let him go. \u201cPlease, stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is all your fault,\u201d Caleb says. \u201cIf you tell anyone, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll think.\u201d</p><p>Sirens flood the air as leaves sweep through the kitchen, swirling around with no other purpose than to go wherever the wind carries them.</p><p>I should have done more. Said something. Stood up for him like he did for me.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d saved Kayden that night at the pool house, but I was wrong. I just bought him time until the next windstorm swept through. </p> </body></html>"]
