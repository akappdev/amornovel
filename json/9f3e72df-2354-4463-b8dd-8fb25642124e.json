Lurnell was a large Creole woman in her mid-thirties with an affinity for spandex and a rock-solid determination to be married before she hit forty. She visited A Little Bit of Magic, the mystic shop Shauna owned with her sisters, Fiona and Caitlin, at least twice a week for a palm reading. For some reason Shauna still didn\u2019t understand, Lurnell had zeroed in on her. Fiona was very gifted at reading tea leaves, and Caitlin was exceptionally intuitive when it came to Tarot cards, but Lurnell would have nothing to do with either of them. She always sought out Shauna for a reading, then would argue adamantly that the marriage line, which didn\u2019t exist on the side of her palm, just below the pinky of her right hand, was certain to appear any day. Even if she had to produce it herself.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d Lurnell said, tapping a three-inch, hot-pink fingernail on the reading table. \u201cIt\u2019s like I been sayin\u2019, right? I know you was thinkin\u2019 I was crazy, but this big girl here, she knows what she\u2019s talkin\u2019 about. You feelin\u2019 me? You hearin\u2019 what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Shauna eyed her.</p><p>Lurnell waggled her head. \u201cOh, uh-uh. Don\u2019t you be givin\u2019 me eyes.\u201d She kissed the palm of her left hand and held it up. \u201cLook here. I swear, hand to God. All I did was wake up this mornin\u2019, and there that line was, all pretty and pink.\u201d</p><p>Shauna took hold of Lurnell\u2019s right hand and turned it pinky side up. \u201cThat\u2019s a cut, and you know it. And you know it because you put it there. You can\u2019t make a marriage line, Lurnell. It\u2019s either there or it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell cocked her head, narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou sayin\u2019 I\u2019m lyin\u2019 about it being for real?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Shauna let go of Lurnell\u2019s hand, sat back and folded her arms across her chest.</p><p>Lurnell mimicked the pose. \u201cAnd what makes you so sure, Ms. Big Drawers? You don\u2019t have no second sight. You just a reader, and look at you actin\u2019 like you all that, tellin\u2019 me I\u2019m lyin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you are. Just like you did the last two times you tried pulling this stunt. Look, just because you don\u2019t have a marriage line doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end of the world. Time changes things, and palms change with it, so if you\u2019ve gotta cut something, cut yourself some slack, will you? If you keep cutting your hand like that, you\u2019re going to wind up with a bad infection.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell tsked loudly and unfolded her arms. \u201cWho taught you palm readin\u2019 anyways, girl? You don\u2019t know nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Shauna grinned. She couldn\u2019t help it. Lurnell always brought the same banter to the table, and she enjoyed swatting it back. \u201cWell, if I don\u2019t know anything, how come you keep asking me for a reading?\u201d</p> <p>Pursing her lips, Lurnell turned sideways in her chair. Shauna knew from experience that this was her way of regrouping, thinking of a good comeback. Normally she would have pounced on the opportunity and thrown out a one-liner just to fluster Lurnell, but a sudden uneasiness settled over her.</p><p>An intuitive whisper.</p><p>She sat silent, keeping her facial expression neutral while she listened for her inner voice, waiting for it to identify the source of the unrest.</p><p>The only thing that came to her was the scent of cinnamon wafting through the air.</p><p>King cake.</p><p>Her oldest sister, Fiona, was a firm believer in lagniappe, giving their customers a little extra treat with their purchases. It was usually something to eat, like pastry samples, homemade cookies, or pralines. With Mardi Gras only three weeks away, it didn\u2019t surprise her that Fiona had chosen to share the holiday\u2019s traditional cake.</p><p>Evidently catching wind of the scent, as well, Lurnell jumped to her feet before Shauna had a chance to push away from the reading table. \u201cWhoa, that be smellin\u2019 good. It\u2019s okay if I go get some, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Shauna got up, and the uneasiness rose with her. Since she couldn\u2019t find a rationale for it, she mentally pushed the feeling aside. Whatever was meant to be revealed by the intuitive whisper would come in due course, that much she knew. She simply had to wait it out.</p> <p>Lurnell patted her stomach, her eyes sparkling with delight. \u201cGirl, I do love king cake. Hey, you got some of that lemon drink? You know, like the kind y\u2019all had last week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean lemon-snap tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, there you go.\u201d Lurnell slapped her hands together. \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna have some of that, too. That\u2019d be good with king, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re out of the lemon-snap, but I can hook you up with a cup of green tea if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell frowned. \u201cAin\u2019t green tea the one\u2019s got all them anti-oxidations in it? You know, that stuff that cleans out all your potty pipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, it has antioxidants, but that\u2019s a good thing. Keeps you healthy.\u201d Shauna grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your pipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, you bes\u2019 be right.\u201d Lurnell flapped a hand, signaling Shauna to lead the way out of the room and be quick about it. She evidently feared a rush on the king cake and didn\u2019t want to miss out. \u201cYou know there ain\u2019t nobody in Sistah\u2019s but me. What I\u2019m gonna do if a customer needs somethin\u2019? I can\u2019t just s\u2019cuse myself and go to the commode, not with the crazy people they got today. Uh-uh. I\u2019d be back in the bathroom and they\u2019d be out front, helpin\u2019 themselves to all my stuff, robbin\u2019 me blind.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell was the sole proprietor of Sistah\u2019s, a mystic shop located on the corner of St. Ann and Rampart, which bordered the north end of the French Quarter. Like most of the tourist shops in the Quarter, it was tightly sandwiched between other shops that sold various baubles, beads, and T-shirts. Sistah\u2019s carried similar items to those in A Little Bit of Magic\u2014crystals, scented candles, herbs, and oils\u2014but it served a different clientele, primarily those who dabbled in voodoo. Although Lurnell didn\u2019t claim to practice voodoo, her specialty items easily led people to believe otherwise. Seven-day spell candles that promised to reverse a curse, remove a hex, or bring wealth and love in abundance. And incense oils that supposedly cured everything from toothaches to temper tantrums, headaches to hemorrhoids. The shop did relatively well considering the neighborhood that surrounded it and the fact that a major competitor\u2014Papa Gris Gris\u2019 Voodoo Shop\u2014was located only three doors down. It was no secret that Lurnell and Papa Gris Gris didn\u2019t play well together. In fact, they\u2019d been enemies for years.</p><p>Shauna led Lurnell into the heart of the store, where she spotted Fiona placing slices of king cake onto a platter near the register. Caitlin was at the opposite end of the shop, talking to an elderly woman who had an exceptionally long, hooked nose. Quite a few customers were wandering about, each stopping occasionally to examine a wall display, an item on a shelf, or something showcased in a curio cabinet.</p><p>Business had been brisk all day, which came as no surprise, given that Mardi Gras was just around the corner. The parades and balls weren\u2019t scheduled to start for another two weeks, but that didn\u2019t matter to the diehard partiers who made their annual pilgrimage to New Orleans. Most of them came early so they wouldn\u2019t miss one of the main local events known as Nuit du Dommage. Literally translated, it meant Night of Damage, and the parties associated with it certainly lived up to its name. It was a pre-Mardi Gras free-for-all, and it was only three days away.</p><p>Dommage and Mardi Gras were always great for business, but both drove Shauna crazy. The streets and sidewalks stayed jammed with so many people it was hard to walk and breathe at the same time. Even worse was the noise. Drunken voices shouting, singing, laughing, talking, and all of them tumbling over hawking, squawking strip-joint barkers and a melange of blaring music\u2014jazz, blues, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u2014that poured out of the bars in the Quarter. Because Shauna\u2019s hearing was so acute, all that noise at such a high volume pained her considerably. It felt like an endless number of needles jabbing into her eardrums.</p><p>Still carrying a sense of uneasiness, Shauna mingled with a few customers, making herself available in case anyone needed help.</p><p>Lurnell had already shoved her way to the front counter and was hovering over the platter of cake. Fiona stood not far away, ringing up another customer at the register. Lurnell must have viewed Fiona\u2019s preoccupation as a grand opportunity because she slipped two pieces of king cake into her oversized purse. She was reaching for a third when Shauna saw Fiona turn toward her. Judging from the small smile dancing on her sister\u2019s lips, Fiona had not been oblivious to the heist. Still, she smiled more broadly, walked over to Lurnell and offered her another piece of cake. Always the gracious hostess.</p><p>Not for the first time, Shauna wished she was more like her sister.</p><p>Being the caboose on a train of three sisters wasn\u2019t always easy. More often than not, Shauna felt like the odd woman out. Fiona was tall and slender, with long, thick hair the color of gold, her eyes a perfect cornflower blue. Caitlin had the same slender build but stood five-nine, a bit taller than Fiona. Her long hair was a darker shade of blonde, which matched beautifully with her magnificent silver-gray eyes. At five-eight, Shauna had height, like her sisters. She also had the same build. Her hair, which she kept pulled up in a ponytail most of the time, was more auburn than blonde, however, and she thought her eyes were a boring shade of green.</p><p>To Shauna, Fiona and Caitlin were the epitome of femininity. The way they walked, talked. Even their closets held proof of it. Both were filled with silky dresses, pastel skirts, and elegant blouses. Shauna\u2019s, on the other hand, held mostly jeans and T-shirts. She did own a couple of skirts, but she kept them tucked away for dress-up emergencies.</p><p>Besides height and build, Shauna shared another similarity with her sisters. She was a Keeper, responsible for maintaining harmony and balance between the humans and the three main underworld subcultures\u2014vampires, shape-shifters, and werewolves\u2014that lived in and around the city. Shauna watched over the werewolves, Fiona the vampires, and Caitlin the shape-shifters. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their parents, Jen and Ewan MacDonald, had been unique Keepers, each born with the power to maintain all three subcultures. When they combined their powers, it had created a seemingly indestructible wall of protection around the city.</p><p>Or so Shauna had thought.</p><p>She had been fifteen when they died. A savage war had broken out between the subcultures, and the power her parents had to call upon to block the warring parties had cost them their lives. No Keeper, no matter how strong, could release that much power and survive. That had been ten years ago.</p> <p>Shauna and her sisters didn\u2019t possess tri-power the way their parents had. Instead, each of them possessed the power of the clan they were responsible for. Shauna couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like to have all three. The weight of responsibility associated with that much power must have been monstrous. Although she was still young and learning, always learning how to be a better Keeper, the load she carried felt heavy enough.</p><p>\u201cHey, you okay?\u201d</p><p>Shauna started, surprised to hear Caitlin\u2019s voice behind her. She turned, offered her sister a small smile. \u201cYeah, fine.\u201d</p><p>Caitlin studied her face for a moment, as if assessing the truth of the response. \u201cYou were pretty zoned out there for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaydreaming, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>Before Caitlin had a chance to respond, a heavyset man wearing Bermuda shorts appeared seemingly out of nowhere and pushed his way into her personal space. \u201cAre you her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Caitlin said.</p><p>\u201cAre you the one who reads Tarot cards? The lady working the register over there said her sister, Caitlin, read cards, then she pointed this way. I wasn\u2019t sure which one of you she meant, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe meant me,\u201d Caitlin said, then directed him to the reading room. \u201cIf you\u2019ll wait for me in there, I\u2019ll only be a minute.\u201d She waited until the man waddled away, then turned to Shauna. \u201cSee the couple standing over by the herbs?\u201d</p><p>Shauna glanced in that direction, saw a young man and woman, both with spiked, multi-colored hair. They swayed slightly on their feet as they pointed to different bags of herbs and giggled. \u201cThey look wasted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me. They were asking for help a minute ago. Tend to them while I do that guy\u2019s reading, will you?\u201d With that, Caitlin headed for the reading room before Shauna could protest.</p> <p>Shauna let out a heavy sigh. She had a sneaking suspicion that the help the couple wanted wouldn\u2019t involve questions about the healing properties of certain herbs. More than likely they would want to know if the store carried pulverized bats\u2019 wings or hogs\u2019 hooves, or some other nonsensical item that someone had told them they needed to cast a certain spell. Normally, no matter how spaced out they were, Shauna would have taken the time to give them the 411 on herbs and try steering them away from the stupid cliff. But she wasn\u2019t up for it today.</p><p>The unrest that had swooped down on her earlier was turning into a case of the jitters. She felt agitated, on edge. Maybe it had something to do with the mingling energies from all the people in the store. All those energies swirling right alongside her intuitive whisper might have tilted her off-center. Whatever the case, she was in no shape to steer anyone in any direction right now. If the couple wanted bat wings, she would simply send them to Sistah\u2019s. Lurnell would be more than happy to sell the couple a half ounce of ground up seaweed or Spanish Moss, all the while swearing it was pulverized bats\u2019 wings that had been harvested back in the eighteenth century in Transylvania.</p><p>As Shauna headed toward the couple she tried tuning into the center of her mind, to the only truly quiet place she knew. She had discovered that place as a child, when her keen sense of hearing wound up collecting too much data from too many directions and over-stimulated her. Fiona had been the one to teach her how to find that special place. How to close her eyes and focus on the small dot of light that always appeared behind her eyelids. Her sister had told her that the light was her center, and that if she concentrated hard enough, that light would always lead her back to a balanced, peaceful place.</p><p>For the most part, Fiona had been right. Over time, Shauna even figured out that she didn\u2019t have to close her eyes to find that light. All she had to do was let her mind\u2019s eye find it, focus on it, and bring her back to center. That certainly made things easier when she was walking through a crowded mall or heading toward a stoned, spike-haired couple.</p><p>Shauna\u2019s mind had just latched on to that dot of light when a strange sound caught her attention and stopped her dead in her tracks.</p><p>It was an odd, low sound. So low that even with her sensitive ears she wondered how she\u2019d heard it at all, with so many people talking in the shop, Lurnell\u2019s voice booming above them all, noise pouring in from the street.</p><p>She closed her eyes for a moment, concentrated on the sound. It grew louder and made the hair on the back of her neck stand on end. She\u2019d never heard anything quite like it before.</p><p>Not quite a moan...</p> <p>A distant wail...</p><p>No. More like an elongated...howl.</p><p>The moment Shauna thought \u201chowl,\u201d her intuitive whisper became a shouting banshee. What she heard was keening. Someone in the throes of such grief, their physical body couldn\u2019t contain it.</p><p>It was the wail of death.</p><p>A plea to the universe.</p><p>A howl of mourning.</p><p>And it was coming from one of her weres...</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>So much blood.</p><p>Facial features distorted. Almost unrecognizable.</p><p>And the eyes\u2014dull with death, yet imprinted with a final, indescribable emotion. A concoction of panic, fear, surprise, horror. The kind of look that might haunt a living man who\u2019d seen it forever.</p><p>Danyon Stone was no stranger to death. Being alpha of the Wolven pack that lived along the East Bank in New Orleans, he\u2019d witnessed the fallout from territorial battles that occasionally took place between his weres and those from other packs in surrounding parishes. When weres fought to the death over territory, or over a mate, the evidence from those fights generally looked the same. Clothing ripped to shreds, gouged flesh, puncture wounds, and blood. Sometimes a lot of it. But this death was far from common.</p><p>The victim was Simon Filk, a young were from Danyon\u2019s pack. Simon had been bright and loyal, eager to learn anything his leader was willing to teach him. Although Simon hadn\u2019t known it, Danyon had been training him for a leadership position. He\u2019d had big plans for him. Now, seeing the young were lying dead at the foot of the levee, Danyon wished he had told Simon.</p><p>In fact, he wished a lot of things right now. He wished he had someone around to explain what the hell he was looking at.</p><p>Heavy cable had been wound about Simon\u2019s chest and feet, binding his arms to his sides and his ankles together. Another cable had been wrapped around his neck. His clothes were only tatters of cloth strewn about his body, and he was soaked in blood. What left Danyon gaping and boggled, however, was that Simon remained in were-state\u2014except for his claws and fangs, all of which had been ripped from his body.</p><p>How in the hell is this possible?</p><p>Different breeds of werewolves carried certain traits, particularly when it came to the triggers that caused their transformation from human to werewolf and vice versa. Some breeds mutated at will, others only in the face of a full moon. The wolven were different in that their transformation usually occurred when they reached an intense emotional state, be it anger, fear, even sexual arousal. As a wolven matured and learned to control the range of his or her emotions, the mutation trigger became more controllable, the transformation more a matter of will. The same controlling factors existed when it came to reverting back to human form, only reversed, the transformation occurring when the heightened emotion was abated, satiated, or controlled. The only time this didn\u2019t apply was at the time of death. Without any exception that Danyon was aware of, the moment a wolven\u2019s heart stopped beating, no matter the manner of death, he assumed human form. The fact that Simon was dead but remained in were-state was incomprehensible to him.</p><p>\u201cWho would do such a horrible thing to Simon?\u201d Andrea Doucet cried.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t no way it was a who, girl,\u201d Paul Mire, who was standing beside her, said. \u201cIt had to be a what to mess him up that bad. Look how that poor boy\u2019s tore up. Thing I can\u2019t figure, though, is how come he ain\u2019t changed? Why\u2019s that, Danyon, huh? Why\u2019s Simon stuck like that? How come he didn\u2019t change back?\u201d</p><p>Wondering the same in spades, Danyon glanced over at his two weres. He had been so taken aback by Simon\u2019s condition that he\u2019d forgotten Andrea and Paul were even there. The two of them had stumbled across the body while walking home from Roosters, a small bar and grill where they both worked, waiting tables.</p><p>Danyon shook his head, indicating he had no answer. The truth was he feared if he opened his mouth right then, the anger roiling inside him would take charge and force a transformation that would demand vengeance. He had to keep a clear head. He might not have answers now, but he was determined to find them or die trying. Right now, his weres were frightened, and, as their leader, he had to take charge and keep his emotions in check. If he didn\u2019t, his entire pack might get skittish, and then he\u2019d have an even bigger problem on his hands.</p><p>He turned to Andrea. Her eyes were swollen from crying, her square, chubby face blotchy. \u201cI need you to go to the Quarter and find Andy Saville. You know who I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, anybody\u2019s ever gone to Jumani\u2019s Bar knows Andy,\u201d Paul said, unfolding his arms. \u201cThat bugger\u2019s gotta be the biggest bouncer in the state of Louisiana. All he\u2019s gotta do is look sideways at a drunk, and they pee their pants they\u2019re so scared.\u201d</p><p>Sniffling, Andrea gave an adamant nod of agreement.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the first time Danyon had heard Andy\u2019s reputation preceding him. He was indeed the largest were in the East Bank pack, and the only one Danyon trusted implicitly. No matter the situation, he could count on Andy to watch his back, keep his mouth shut, not ask questions, and follow orders to the letter. If ever those attributes were needed, it was now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo to Jumani\u2019s first,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Andy\u2019s on shift until later, but he usually goes in early.

Think you can remember just the tarp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. All you have to do is tell Andy to bring two big tarps.

If you can remember to tell him that, Andy will know what to bring. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, you mean we\u2019re gonna leave him here \u2019til dark?\u201d Paul asked. He was pacing now, a short tight path between two trees. \u201cWe just gonna let the flies start collectin\u2019 on his eyes and stuff?\u201d</p><p>Andrea let out a loud sob and covered her face with her hands.</p><p>Danyon shot Paul a look.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019d I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to be so graphic?\u201d Danyon aimed his chin at Andrea, hoping Paul caught the message. She\u2019s upset, numb-nuts, so cool it.</p> <p>Evidently catching the gist of Danyon\u2019s meaning, Paul looked down at his feet. \u201cI was only askin\u2019 is all,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to leave him here until dark.\u201d Danyon walked to the opposite side of the road, then pushed his way through the thicket until he found a patch heavy with bramble and foliage. \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave him here, where no one can see his body.\u201d</p><p>Andrea slowly slid her hands away from her face, peered in Danyon\u2019s direction. \u201cIs...will...are you sure Simon\u2019s going to be okay in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Paul said. \u201cLike there\u2019s no snakes or rats or stuff like that in there, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-Snakes?\u201d Andrea\u2019s face drained of color.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Paul!\u201d Danyon warned.</p><p>Paul\u2019s mouth fell open in surprise. Then he snapped it shut, pouted, and folded his arms across his chest.</p><p>Ignoring him, Danyon walked back over to Andrea.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, honey, Simon will be fine here. I promise.</p><p>Do you remember what you have to tell Andy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTarp\u2014messy\u2014dark\u2014metal,\u201d Andrea said, ticking the items off her fingers.</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d Danyon gave her a reassuring smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Paul asked. \u201cI can remember to tell Andy stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying with me. I need help moving the body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, no way!\u201d Paul took two quick steps backward. \u201cAndy\u2019ll help you. W-Wait for Andy.\u201d</p><p>Having already positioned himself at the head of the body, Danyon glared at him. \u201cSimon\u2019s been out here too long as it is. Somebody might drive or walk by here any minute. He has to be moved now, so suck it up. Come over here and take hold of his feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, like actually touch him? No effin\u2019 way!\u201d</p><p>A low growl rumbled at the back of Danyon\u2019s throat. He allowed it to rise in volume to make sure Paul heard it. \u201cI said, take hold of his feet.\u201d</p><p>Paul ran a shaking hand through his shoulder-length hair. \u201cYeah, o-okay, but...I\u2014I don\u2019t know if I can touch him. I\u2014I mean, look at all that blood. What if...what if I, like, throw up or something? Maybe we\u2014\u201d</p><p>The sound of moving brush grabbed Danyon\u2019s attention, and he held up a hand to silence Paul. He cocked an ear to the sound.</p><p>Someone...something...running toward them.</p><p>Danyon lifted his head, sniffed, caught the scent of panic\u2014fury\u2014a male were. Instantly, the muscles in his body began to ripple, burn\u2014preparing for the change, instinctively engineered for fight or flight. For Danyon, though, it always meant fight. Flight simply wasn\u2019t in an alpha\u2019s DNA. No way anyone or anything was going to take them by surprise.</p><p>Andrea must have picked up on the sound, as well, because she let out a loud gasp, then cried out, \u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d She suddenly dropped into a squat and covered her head with her arms. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die just like Simon! They\u2019re coming to kill us, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Where\u2014what?\u201d Paul spun about. First left, then right, then left again, trying to look everywhere at once. \u201cSomeone\u2019s...coming? Where?\u201d</p><p>Danyon sniffed the air again, wanting to get a handle on how quickly the runner was closing in.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better go then, right?\u201d Paul said. He hurried over to Andrea and grabbed her by the arm. \u201cDanyon, let\u2019s go, okay? I don\u2019t wanna...I mean, Simon was a good guy and everything, but I...I don\u2019t wanna wind up like him. Let\u2019s just go, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Danyon commanded. The runner was closing in fast, his scent stronger...much stronger now.</p><p>It was one of his weres.</p><p>No sooner did the realization strike Danyon than Ian Sykes thundered out of the brush. He was in mid-transformation from were to human, panting, gasping, until he pulled up short on two legs right in front of Danyon.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dead!\u201d Ian cried, frantically searching Danyon\u2019s face as if all the answers to life hid there. \u201cThey killed her\u2014somebody killed her!\u201d</p><p>Danyon felt a burning sensation in the center of his chest. It was the fire. The key to every wolven. Their light...their life force...their core. Just as the earth fed upon the fiery core that gave it life, they drank from the lava pool within each of them. It was sustenance that strengthened body, mind and spirit, and heightened all five senses. It bubbled higher and higher in Danyon\u2019s chest.</p><p>Another death.</p><p>Another life snuffed out on his watch.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Danyon asked, then immediately regretted asking the question. He already knew the answer. There was only one person whose death would affect Ian this way.</p><p>\u201cNicole,\u201d Ian said, his voice sharp with incredulity.</p><p>Andrea gasped. \u201cOh, no, not Nicky! Please...it can\u2019t be her, Ian. She can\u2019t be dead!\u201d She put a hand to her mouth, sobbing uncontrollably now.</p><p>Ian nodded slowly, his eyes lost to a scene that belonged to another time and place. When he spoke again, his voice was barely above a whisper. \u201cThey...they found her body between two pilings off Barataria. Sh-she was a-all messed up...bad. Lotta blood.\u201d His focus reconnected with Danyon. \u201cShe\u2019s dead. She\u2019s really dead.\u201d</p><p>Ian Sykes and Nicole Bergeron had been a couple since they were pups. You never saw one without the other. They\u2019d been inseparable.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ian asked. \u201cWh-Why would anyone want to hurt her? She was...\u201d As Ian struggled to find the words to express his horror and the magnitude of his disbelief, he suddenly did a double-take and gawked. He\u2019d spotted Simon.</p><p>Ian looked up at Danyon, back down at Simon, back to Danyon. \u201cJust like N-Nicky...just l-like that. They killed her...just like that, Danyon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she change back?\u201d Paul asked quietly. As though fearing the answer, he crossed his arms and tucked a hand under each armpit. He rocked nervously from side to side. \u201cDid she? Or...or did she, uh...stay stuck, like Simon?\u201d</p><p>Ian covered his face with his hands, dropped to his knees. \u201cShe...she\u2019s still were. I\u2014I don\u2019t understand it. My girl\u2019s still\u2014\u201d Sobbing, he dropped his hands, then threw his head back and let out a wail, then a mournful howl so loud and long, Danyon felt it in his soul.</p><p>At that moment it would have been easier for Danyon to climb Mount Everest with only one leg than to control the fury growing inside him. Two of his weres were dead. Both stripped of their claws and fangs, the two things that protected them, fed them.</p><p>His fury was certainly justifiable. But Danyon knew if he allowed it to manifest, he would be under its control. Raw vengeance would consume him. Even now, struggling to keep himself together, he wanted to rip through something, anything. If he allowed the fury to take over, he would lose clarity, the ability to wisely discern. For Simon and Nicole\u2019s sake, for the safety of the entire pack, he couldn\u2019t let that happen. Justice would never be served that way. In fact, it wasn\u2019t being served now. Not by him standing here, getting angrier by the minute. He needed answers to questions that seemed too improbable to pose.</p><p>Who or what was powerful enough to hold down a were, restrain it, then tear out its claws and fangs?</p><p>Why on earth had the murderer chosen Nicole and Simon? Neither would have purposely harmed a soul.</p><p>There was only one person Danyon knew who might have some answers or at least be able to lead him in the right direction to find answers. August Gaudin.</p><p>August was the master elder of all the were packs in the South. Every alpha reported to August and was responsible to him. He was a wise, fair leader, and everyone respected him immensely.</p><p>This situation was so out of the ordinary, though, that even August might not have answers. Whatever the case, Danyon had to find the elder right away and let him know about the deaths\u2014and not only because it was his duty. He had to report and make himself accountable to August, before the rage took over.</p><p>Before he wound up being a murderer instead of finding one.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Trying to act normal with all her senses on high alert, was like trying to shove an elephant into a linen closet.</p><p>Hopeless.</p><p>Shauna felt certain a were was in trouble, but she wasn\u2019t sure what to do about it. She had no idea who the were might be or what kind of trouble he or she might be in. Intuition was usually a given for a Keeper, but she hated when it didn\u2019t provide enough details for follow through. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She had to do something besides pace, though. For her own sanity and to reassure Fiona, who kept looking over at her every couple of minutes from behind the register.</p><p>Fortunately, Caitlin had been too busy to notice how fidgety she\u2019d gotten. Unfortunately, her sister\u2019s heavy workload came from picking up Shauna\u2019s slack. She had managed to help the spike-haired couple Caitlin had directed her to earlier. Thankfully they hadn\u2019t asked about pulverized bats\u2019 wings or hogs\u2019 hooves, as Shauna had suspected. They\u2019d wanted gum mastic and dried anise, the first to snort, the second to smoke. All because a friend swore both gave quite the buzz. She\u2019d been slightly abrupt with a response, stating that if they considered death a buzz, then they should go for it. That had certainly sobered them up.</p><p>Once she was rid of them, Shauna had tried helping another customer or two, but she\u2019d been unable to concentrate on their questions long enough to answer them. She felt useless.</p> <p>That horrible, mournful keening sound haunted her. It wasn\u2019t as loud as it was earlier, but it was still there. No less distressing, so painful to hear. Stabbing her repeatedly in the heart. It seemed to call to her. Beg for her...</p><p>She considered talking to Fiona about it. Since she was the oldest and the most experienced Keeper, Fiona might be able to tell her what she should do, if anything, about what she heard. Then Shauna reconsidered. The wolvens were her responsibility, and if she was so certain it was a wolven\u2019s cry, she wanted\u2014needed\u2014to handle it on her own. Just because she was the youngest didn\u2019t mean she always had to run to her big sister for help. If she was ever to fully understand and trust her instincts, she had to work through them. Right now, though, instinct was telling her to get the hell off her butt and do something. She just wasn\u2019t quite sure what that \u2018something\u2019 should be.</p><p>As if hearing her thoughts, and it wouldn\u2019t have surprised Shauna if she had, Fiona signaled her over. Shauna reluctantly headed her way. If her sister asked her what was wrong, she couldn\u2019t lie to her, no matter how badly she wanted to work things out on her own.</p><p>Just before she reached the counter, two middle-aged women dressed in expensive linen suits walked up to the register, wanting to check out. Shauna offered a silent thank-you to the universe for the reprieve.</p><p>\u201cHey, where the baby at?\u201d Lurnell asked, while chewing on yet another piece of king cake. She hadn\u2019t moved from her spot at the counter, the one nearest the cake platter. The baby she referred to was the pink, plastic, one-inch doll always hidden in a king cake. Tradition had it that a year\u2019s worth of good luck and fortune belonged to whoever found the doll in their piece of cake. To keep that luck rolling, that person had to buy another king cake and share it with friends and family.</p> <p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t find it,\u201d Shauna said, \u201cthere must not have been one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, you crazy. You know they all got babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it did, you would have found it, since you ate most of the cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Lurnell glanced down at the platter...of crumbs. \u201cUhh...\u201d She dusted the crumbs off her hands. \u201cYeah, guess you right. Probably had a machine broke down to the cake fact\u2019ry or somethin\u2019. They bes\u2019 hurry up and fix that. People gettin\u2019 kings with no babies like that, they ain\u2019t gonna know what to do. It could get nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me...\u201d One of the women Shauna had seen standing near the register a moment ago now stood beside her. She held up a hand, pinky and forefinger slightly extended as if preparing for high tea. \u201cI could not help overhearing your conversation, and my curiosity simply got the best of me. Would you please explain what a baby has to do with a cake?\u201d</p><p>Lurnell snorted. \u201cYou ain\u2019t from here, huh?\u201d</p> <p>High tea became a small, dismissive wave. \u201cHeavens, no. I\u2019m from the Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere that\u2019s at, the Valley? Out by Shreveport?\u201d</p><p>The woman rolled her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s in California, dear. San Fernando, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell\u2019s educational background might not have been extensive, but she didn\u2019t need a Harvard degree to know she\u2019d been talked down to. Her nostrils flared, the first sign that Mount Lurnell was about to blow.</p><p>Fiona must have realized the same thing because she suddenly appeared, holding a small, pink, plastic doll. \u201cLook what I found,\u201d she said. \u201cProbably fell out of the cake when I was slicing it.\u201d She smiled, then handed it to Lurnell. \u201cYou\u2019re the one standing closest to the platter, so I think you should have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real? Me?\u201d Lurnell said, eyes wide as she took the doll. Her notion to teach Ms. High Tea a few manners had obviously taken a backseat to more important matters.</p><p>Lurnell held the plastic luck charm up for everyone to see. \u201cLook here, y\u2019all. I got me the baby!\u201d</p><p>A handful of customers applauded, and Lurnell did a little jig and a booty-bump.</p> <p>As Lurnell carried on about the luck coming her way, which, of course, included getting the man of her dreams, Fiona tapped Shauna on the shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Relieved her sister hadn\u2019t asked what was wrong, Shauna said truthfully, \u201cJust antsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much noise?\u201d</p><p>Shauna nodded. That was the truth, as well. That constant keening rising and falling in volume was upsetting her. She knew Fiona meant the noise in the shop, but who was she to split hairs?</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019re busy,\u201d Shauna said, \u201cand I feel like a heel for asking, but would you mind if I went out for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Fiona gave Shauna\u2019s shoulders a little rub.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Caitlin will care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019d be stuck doing work I should be doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll be fine. I planned on closing early anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly? Why, when we\u2019re so busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeno\u2019s, you know, the place in Lake Charles where we get our herbs, essential oils, specialty soaps, stuff like that? They can\u2019t get a delivery here until next week, and we can\u2019t wait that long. I was thinking maybe we\u2019d take a ride out there and pick up the order ourselves. The way I see it, we either lose a partial day\u2019s business today or lose a lot of it the rest of the week because we\u2019re out of stock. Besides, we can use the breather before all hell breaks loose this weekend anyway.\u201d</p><p>Really feeling guilty now, Shauna said, \u201cI can just go out for a short walk, then come back and watch the shop, if you and Caitlin want to drive out there.\u201d</p><p>Fiona smiled. \u201cI said we could use the breather. All of us. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to come with us to Lake Charles, though.\u201d</p><p>Shauna held back a sigh of relief. \u201cWon\u2019t you need help when you get out there? You know, loading\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you stop worrying? Go, take a walk. Better yet, go for a run. I know how much you love running. It might help burn off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy word! What is that?\u201d</p><p>Shauna and Fiona turned in unison.</p><p>High Tea was pointing at the large display window at the front of the shop, her expression sour, as if she\u2019d just bitten into a persimmon. Shauna didn\u2019t see what was so appalling until she looked through the window with the eyes of a tourist. Then it became obvious.</p><p>An extremely thin woman, wearing faded red Daisy Dukes, a dirty, pink T-shirt and black stilettos, was pacing the sidewalk in front of the shop. Her stringy brown hair had been corralled into a crooked ponytail, and she held two lit cigarettes, one in each hand. She puffed on one then the other in rapid succession, all the while talking to herself.</p><p>\u201cYou allow homeless people to stand in front of your store that way?\u201d High Tea asked. \u201cDon\u2019t the police do anything to keep them off the street?\u201d</p><p>Now Shauna wanted to teach the woman a few manners herself. \u201cAnd where do you suggest the police take them? Their high-rise on the back forty?\u201d</p><p>Fiona tugged on the back of Shauna\u2019s T-shirt, her signal to back off.</p><p>Shauna caught the message but couldn\u2019t help adding, \u201cFor all we know, that woman might not even be homeless. Maybe she\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, that ain\u2019t homeless,\u201d Lurnell said, making her way to the window. \u201cThat\u2019s trash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s just down on her luck. That doesn\u2019t make her trash.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell batted a hand at her. \u201cGirl, they trash if they out runnin\u2019 a line of blow while they babies at home alone with no food and in stinky diapers. Oh, yeah, that\u2019s trash. That be a whole damn trash truck if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cShe ain\u2019t like my friend or nothin\u2019, but, yeah, I know her. She works in one of them bars over at the casino. They call her Mattress Mattie, \u2019cause she always spread in\u2019 them skinny legs so she can make that green. She got two babies\u2014two, you hearin\u2019 me? And what you think she be doin\u2019 with that little extra somethin\u2019 she makin\u2019 on the side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuying drugs,\u201d High Tea said, her tone definitive.</p><p>\u201cSee that?\u201d Lurnell said. \u201cEven Miss Thing got the set up, and she ain\u2019t even from around here.\u201d</p><p>High Tea beamed as if she\u2019d just won a prize.</p><p>Lurnell tapped on the window, apparently to get Mattie\u2019s attention. The woman kept pacing, smoking, talking to herself.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she hurtin\u2019 right now. Needin\u2019 some blow. Bet she out there waitin\u2019 for her dealer.\u201d</p><p>High Tea gasped. \u201cYou allow them to deal drugs out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Fiona said sharply. \u201cWe can\u2019t control what people do on the street, though. Did you see a drug deal take place in front of this shop? If you did, please tell me because I obviously missed it.\u201d</p><p>With a haughty lift of her chin, High Tea tsked. \u201cWell, if I owned this establishment, I would\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNow what you think that piece of shrimp bait\u2019s doin\u2019 out there?\u201d Lurnell said, planting a fist on a hip. \u201cThat boy is trouble all by his ownself.\u201d</p><p>Mattie had company now. She was talking to Banjo Marks, a young vampire who came from an old bayou family. Shauna knew he was homeless and a junkie. The guy eagerly swallowed, snorted, or injected, anything and everything he got his hands on. His weekly regimen consisted of LSD, pot, crystal-meth and cocaine. Whatever he scored in between those primers, Banjo considered lagniappe. He was tall and lanky, and had thin, scraggly blond hair that hung in greasy strands down to the middle of his back. Most of the time he smelled like wet, soured towels.</p><p>As if life hadn\u2019t piled enough on Banjo\u2019s plate, he didn\u2019t fit the standard vampire profile, even for this area. He ate and drank like a human. Shauna didn\u2019t know if the years of drug use had caused him to mutate, which in turn allowed him to digest food, or if he was the byproduct of an accidental cross-breeding. Either way, it was strange to see. He came to the shop often, always looking for a handout. And Fiona, being the Keeper of the vampires and the kind-hearted mother hen that she was, never failed to give him food and something warm or cool to drink, whichever the weather dictated.</p> <p>As for Shauna, she never liked being around Banjo, and it had nothing to do with his drug use or smell. He had a high-pitched voice and an odd, twittering laugh that sounded like a hyena mating with a screeching macaw. It sawed on her last nerve.</p><p>Mattie and Banjo were yelling now, standing almost nose to nose. Although Shauna could easily hear their conversation, both were so hyped up that most of it came across as gibberish.</p><p>\u201c\u2014today, asshole, you said today!\u201d Mattie jabbed Banjo\u2019s shoulder with a finger. \u201cYou said\u2014I been waitin\u2019... Where\u2019s at? Where?\u201d</p><p>As Mattie poked at Banjo, he shuffled left a few steps, then turned about and moved up one step in the other direction, as if he were square-dancing alone. Then came that horrid, twittering laugh.</p><p>\u201cSwear, swear to Gawd, gonna be here,\u201d he gibbered. \u201cLittle problem, gonna be here, though. Yeah, you gonna see\u2014fresh, fresh, fresh. Gonna come, swear to Gawd.\u201d</p> <p>Mattie shoved him, and Banjo stumbled backwards, his arms pin-wheeling for balance. She trapped him against a nearby light pole, jabbing a finger at his chest this time. \u201cYou\u2014shit...sonofawhore! You promised, you motherf\u2014\u201d</p><p>The twittering laugh\u2014that God-awful twittering laugh...</p><p>Their fight grew so intense people crossed the street to avoid them.</p><p>\u201cEnough\u2019s enough,\u201d Shauna said, and headed for the door. She really didn\u2019t care if they pulled each other\u2019s hair out. What she\u2019d had enough of was Banjo\u2019s laughter.</p><p>\u201cShauna wait,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cI\u2019ll call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you best hold up, girl,\u201d Lurnell called after her.</p> <p>Shauna glanced back at her, then returned her attention to the street in time to see Mattie throw a punch at Banjo\u2019s face. To her surprise, he ducked in time to avoid getting hit. Instead of his face, Mattie\u2019s fist connected with the light pole\u2014and dented it.</p><p>Shauna gaped. Every light pole in the city was constructed of heavy metal due to the narrow streets, heavy traffic and drivers with little to no peripheral vision. No way a skinny woman with bad aim would be able to do that much damage.</p><p>\u201cWhoa! You see that?\u201d Lurnell said.</p><p>Just then the keening sound that had kept Shauna on edge for the last couple of hours grew in volume. Within seconds, it was all she heard. She saw Lurnell\u2019s mouth moving but heard no words.</p><p>Only that pained, mournful cry...loud and long.</p><p>It sank deep into Shauna\u2019s chest\u2014threatened to yank out her heart.</p><p>She had to find the source.</p><p>No doubt in her mind...something was happening...had happened...would happen. No doubt in her mind, it was bad.</p> <p>All of it very, very bad.</p><p>He ran.</p><p>Hard, fast...</p><p>Breathless...</p><p>Mindless.</p><p>It was all Danyon knew to do.</p><p>Act on instinct.</p><p>After Andrea left to find Andy, he and Paul had moved Simon\u2019s body into the thicket. He\u2019d ordered Paul to stay put and keep watch. If anyone came into the area, he was to steer them away from the thicket, by any means necessary. Paul, who\u2019d puked his guts out the entire time they moved Simon, had all but burst into tears, not wanting to be left alone with a dead body.</p><p>With no other choice but to leave him in a sniveling heap, Danyon had followed Ian to a set of pilings off Barataria Boulevard, where he\u2019d found Nicole\u2019s body.</p><p>Ian had been right. She was in the same condition as Simon. Clothes tattered and strewn about, lying in a pool of her own blood, bound about the chest and ankles, and in full were-state, claws and fangs ripped away. There was one difference between the deaths, however. Unlike Simon, heavy cable hadn\u2019t been used to restrain Nicole. Only thin, silver wire.</p><p>The pain from the silver alone would have been excruciating. It had burned through Nicole\u2019s fur and flesh, then lodged itself in bone. Definitely enough to keep her restrained all by itself.</p><p>Danyon hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to examine Simon fully yet, but he suspected that, initially, the same silver wire had been used to incapacitate him. Since he was bigger and stronger than Nicole, the cable would have been necessary to keep him securely restrained while they removed his claws and fangs. Nicole, on the other hand, was petite. Even when fully transformed into were-state, she had been no bigger than a six-month-old German Shepherd pup.</p><p>Seeing the young female were stuffed between two pilings had been bad enough, but what really got to Danyon was her fur. She was double-coated, covered with beautiful light brown fur streaked with different shades of gold and white. She literally sparkled when she ran through the sunlight. Seeing that beautiful coat covered with blood, the deep-set eyes once filled with innocence and ease now frozen in terror, had been his undoing. Rage overtook him, and he transformed almost instantaneously.</p><p>Fortunately, part of his brain had remained rational, reminding him that he had to tell August Gaudin, the leader of all the were packs in the South, about the deaths. That human thought battled with his feral nature as he ran toward the city, toward the French Quarter, where he would find August. That thought was the only thing that kept Danyon from hunting anything breathing just so he could slaughter it.</p><p>Running helped him push past the pain of what he\u2019d witnessed.</p><p>By the time he reached Orleans Avenue, which was six blocks north of the Quarter, he had calmed enough to return to human form. His clothes were nearly non-existent, since he all but doubled in size as a wolf, so he\u2019d had to dodge in and out of alleyways and behind buildings to avoid being seen.</p><p>He\u2019d gone straight home, which was the entire fifth floor of La Maison Pierre, a five-storey hotel he owned on the south side of Ursulines. Once there, he\u2019d slipped through the back entrance, took a private elevator to the top floor then quickly changed into slacks and a button-down shirt.</p><p>Now he headed for Canal Street and August\u2019s office complex. He kept his walk brisk, his head down, watching his shoes as a maelstrom of questions blew through his mind.</p><p>Why would anyone want to kill Simon and Nicole? Neither one would ever have harmed a soul.</p><p>Is someone targeting my pack, or were Simon and Nicole simply in the wrong place at the wrong time?</p><p>The biggest question that plagued him, though, was who or what had been able to capture them. It would certainly have taken more than one human to keep Simon under control once he transformed into were-form, even if they had subdued him with silver before wrapping him in cable. In human form, Simon had been six foot one and weighed at least a hundred-seventy-five pounds. As a wolf, he towered over seven feet, and just the additional flesh and muscle mass added another seventy-five pounds or more to his weight. No, it would have taken more than an entire army of men to hold Simon down.</p><p>Another thought crossed Danyon\u2019s mind, and it nearly stopped him cold. Both death scenes had been covered with blood, but aside from Simon and Nicole being declawed and defanged, he hadn\u2019t noticed any other major injuries. No gunshot wounds to the body or head. No blunt force trauma. He hadn\u2019t examined either close enough to check for stab wounds, which he planned to do when he met up with Andy later, but aside from that possibility, what had actually killed his two weres?</p><p>Danyon was still deep in thought when a woman suddenly appeared in his line of sight, only inches away from his face. Instinctively, he reached out and took hold of her upper arms to minimize the collision.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said. \u201cI...\u201d The sight of her fiery green eyes sent a jolt of recognition through him. It was Shauna MacDonald.</p><p>He\u2019d met her a few times at the bi-annual council meetings, when the underworld subcultures in New Orleans and the surrounding area met to discuss communal issues. He knew Shauna owned A Little Bit of Magic, the mystic shop on Royal, along with her sisters, Fiona and Caitlin. And he knew all three were Keepers.</p><p>Every time he saw Shauna, her beauty captured his attention to the point of distraction. She was tall and slender, her long, strawberry blonde hair usually up in a ponytail. Her skin, although fair, had a healthy glow. Only a dead man wouldn\u2019t take notice of her.</p><p>Even more problematic for Danyon was Shauna\u2019s scent. It was a pheromonal tidal wave of passion, femininity and latent sexuality. It drove him mad with desire, and he had to struggle to resist it.</p><p>Shauna, on the other hand, appeared to have little or no interest in him at all. Whenever they were in the same room, she refused to make eye contact with him and usually kept her end of the conversation brief, clipped, as though being around him irritated her, and she couldn\u2019t wait to get away.</p><p>It was just as well.</p><p>Even if Shauna were interested in him, nothing could ever come of it.</p><p>She was human.</p><p>He was a wolven, and an alpha at that. That was a vast chasm to overcome. Danyon knew those differences would always keep her from fully understanding the depth of his true nature, even if she was his Keeper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still holding on to her arms, Danyon suddenly became keenly aware of the feel of her skin under his palms. Soft...silky...warm. Very warm.</p><p>He felt his pulse quicken, his nostrils flare.</p><p>He should have felt guilty right then. Two of his weres were dead. He\u2019d just wiped their blood from his hands.</p> <p>But he felt no guilt.</p><p>There was no room for it. Not now. For every one of Danyon\u2019s senses was on high alert. Each one excruciatingly aware of her.</p><p>And the effect left him ravenous.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>Shauna pulled out of Danyon\u2019s grasp more abruptly than she\u2019d intended. She\u2019d been lost in thought, not paying attention to where she was going and had nearly collided into him. It had taken a couple of seconds for her to blink all six foot four of him into focus, but once she did, recognition was instantaneous. That didn\u2019t surprise her. Danyon was not a man easily forgotten. That exceptionally broad chest, sharp facial features and strong chin...his eyes, the color of honey still on the comb. His thick black hair, a little longer than shoulder-length, was combed back, away from his face. He smelled of soap and testosterone at full throttle. Shauna had never allowed herself to get this close to him before, and had it not been for this accidental encounter, probably never would have.</p> <p>And all for good reason.</p><p>Her mind turned into a puddle of goo every time she was around Danyon. Her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth, and she would start fidgeting, like a nervous school girl, something she never did. His extraordinary good looks, sharp intellect and wit, and the smoldering sexuality that seemed to ooze out of him when he moved, made her heart beat too fast. She kept her distance to maintain control of her mind and her body, something she would never admit to another soul.</p><p>As a Keeper, Shauna had a lot of expectations to live up to. Being the youngest Keeper made things even tougher, because it came with its own set of challenges. She always felt she had to prove her competency twice as much as her two sisters. And in order to do that, she had to keep her mind and body strong and focused. She couldn\u2019t afford to appear vulnerable. Especially to a wolven. Even one as breathtaking as Danyon.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s happened,\u201d Shauna said, hearing her words come out as a statement rather than the question she\u2019d intended.</p><p>Danyon nodded, his eyes wary, quickly scanning both sides of the street. In profile, his hair glistened with a blue-black sheen.</p><p>Shauna\u2019s heart quickened. She had to force herself not to take a step back.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Shauna looked up at him questioningly.</p><p>\u201cI mean who told you? What did they tell you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced away from the intensity of his stare. \u201cNo one told me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat there was trouble?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, and his gaze intensified.</p><p>How was she supposed to explain what she\u2019d heard in the shop? That weird keening she\u2019d instinctively known was a cry for help? Or that she\u2019d heard it over a shop filled with tourists, city noise pouring in from the street and Mattie and Banjo\u2019s fight? How was she to explain that without sounding like a kook?</p> <p>Shauna opted for the direct route. \u201cI heard it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHeard what?\u201d He frowned, evidently confused.</p><p>She chewed her bottom lip a moment. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure. It felt...it sounded like a wolven in trouble. I was going to August\u2019s to find out if he knew anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m headed there myself.\u201d Danyon didn\u2019t appear surprised in the least by what she\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know? Anything?\u201d</p><p>His face hardened. \u201cUnfortunately, yes. Two of my weres are dead.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, this time Shauna did take a step back. \u201cWho? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon Filk and Nicole Bergeron. Not sure when they were killed, but both were found a couple of hours\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. They were killed? As in murdered?\u201d Shauna\u2019s head reeled. The name Simon Filk rang a bell, but she couldn\u2019t place a face with the name. Nicole, on the other hand, she knew. Nicole and her boyfriend, Ian, came to A Little Bit of Magic often, especially the tea and coffee kiosk. She even remembered their usual order: bayberry tea and pecan scones.</p><p>\u201cIt appears so, yes. Two other weres from my pack were headed home from work when they found Simon at the foot of the levee near River Road. Ian found Nicole. She\u2019d been shoved between two pilings off Barataria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod...poor Ian. The guy must be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevastated. And even that\u2019s an understatement.\u201d</p><p>Shauna shook her head in disbelief. \u201cBut murdered? How...? You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>Danyon gave her what sounded like a condensed version of what he knew so far and what he\u2019d seen. As she listened, Shauna felt her stomach roll over, her knees weaken. By the time he finished, though, she was so angry, she could have tortured and killed the murderer bare-handed. She was also furious with Danyon.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you moved the bodies,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have alerted someone first,\u201d Shauna fumed. \u201cThe police, August, me. You might have destroyed vital evidence.\u201d</p><p>Danyon\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cAnd what do you think would have happened if a human, or anyone else for that matter, had come across them the way Andrea and Paul did? They were in were-state, Shauna. What did you want me to do, just leave them there? Maybe throw a tarp over the bodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be crass.\u201d Shauna shoved a hand in the back pocket of her jeans. \u201cWhen did you plan on telling me about this? Next week? Next month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you suddenly become my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Keeper of the wolvens! I have every right to know what\u2019s going on at all times.\u201d</p><p>Danyon stood tall, jabbed a thumb to his chest. \u201cAnd I\u2019m the alpha of the East Bank pack. Those were my weres! I\u2019m responsible for them, and I can take care of my own.\u201d</p><p>Shauna leaned toward him. \u201cBut I\u2019m their Keeper. And, in case you\u2019ve forgotten, yours, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything? Simon and Nicole are dead. Just what is there to keep...Keeper?\u201d</p><p>She snapped her head back as though slapped.</p><p>Regret flickered in his eyes, but it went away as quickly as it arrived.</p><p>\u201cMay I remind you, Mr. Stone,\u201d Shauna said through gritted teeth, \u201cit\u2019s my responsibility to keep peace between the wolven, the other races, and the humans in this city. By not telling me, you put everyone in danger. When word of this gets out, too much or too little information can end up open to interpretation. Have you forgotten about the cemetery murders six months ago, or what happened when the walk-ins tried taking over the city three months after that? In both cases, vampires suspected the shape-shifters, shifters pointed at the weres, everybody pointed at everybody else. If Fiona hadn\u2019t taken charge of her vampires during the cemetery murders and Caitlin her shifters in the walk-in disaster, we might have had another war on our hands. The same kind of war that killed our parents.\u201d</p><p>By that time, Shauna\u2019s anger had grown to such a fever pitch, she stepped closer, pushed against him. \u201cLook, you might be the big dog on campus when it comes to the East Bank pack, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig dog? Now who\u2019s being crass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am the Keeper of the wolven in this city. Moving those bodies was poor judgment on your part. The police should have been notified immediately.\u201d</p><p>Danyon\u2019s expression went cold. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? Simon and Nicole were in were-state. What sense would it have made to involve humans when we spend half our time hiding our true identities from them so they don\u2019t destroy us? None, period. I was not going to take the chance that Simon or Nicole would be seen in that condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to involve a human,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cYou could have called Jagger DeFarge. You know perfectly well he\u2019s a homicide detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA homicide detective and a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich only means he\u2019d be more sensitive to the situation. He\u2019s part of the underworld. He knows what has to be protected.\u201d</p><p>Danyon looked away for a second, and Shauna could have sworn she heard a low growl rumble from his throat. \u201cWe are wolven!\u201d he declared. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a vampire involved in our business. I don\u2019t need DeFarge\u2019s help, nor do I need you questioning my actions. Nicole and Simon were my responsibility. I will find their murderers. And believe me, there will be justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd as their Keeper, I will be involved, whether you like it or not!\u201d Realizing her voice had gotten a little too loud, Shauna glanced about, making sure their conversation was still private.</p><p>This time there was no mistaking the low growl emanating from Danyon. Without another word, he whipped around and headed down the street, his long legs quickly widening the distance between them.</p><p>Furious that he\u2019d so abruptly dismissed her, Shauna hurriedly back-tracked a block. She planned to detour to a side street that led to the rear of August\u2019s office complex and beat Danyon there.</p><p>She walked fast, talking herself out of breaking into a full run. This was starting to feel ridiculous, as if she were one of the last two children left in a game of musical chairs, and only one chair remained. She\u2019d always hated that game.</p><p>Okay, so she might she have gotten a little exuberant\u2014upset, even\u2014because she hadn\u2019t been contacted when Simon and Nicole were discovered. Still, that was no excuse for Danyon to get so huffy. She probably could have handled things more diplomatically, but he didn\u2019t have to go storming off as if she\u2019d peed in his Cheerios, for heaven\u2019s sake.</p><p>If she really wanted to be honest with herself, though, the buck stopped with her. She had a temper and knew it. It\u2019s what made it too easy for her to run off at the mouth. Along with that, Danyon gave her mush-brain. Not the man\u2019s fault, but she was living proof that temper and mush-brain made for a bad combination. Any man, wolven or not, would have gotten upset by the way she\u2019d handled the situation. Her responsibility as a Keeper was to help keep peace between the subcultures and humans in New Orleans. The way she\u2019d confronted Danyon had been anything but peaceful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shauna slowed her pace.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a game of musical chairs. And it wasn\u2019t about her or Danyon or her attraction to him.</p><p>It was about Simon and Nicole, about finding their murderer.</p> <p>It was about justice.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>When Shauna finally reached the main lobby of August\u2019s office complex, Danyon had already arrived. He was standing alongside Rita Quinn, August\u2019s executive assistant, near the entrance to the hallway that led to August\u2019s maze of offices. As always, the middle-aged were looked immaculate. She wore a lavender pencil skirt and a white silk blouse, and her light brown hair had been rolled into a perfect French twist. Elegant and tasteful, just like everything in August\u2019s life.</p><p>When Rita spotted Shauna, she smiled warmly.</p><p>Danyon barely looked her way.</p> <p>\u201cHow wonderful to see you, Ms. MacDonald,\u201d Rita said. \u201cYour timing is perfect, as always. I was about to lead Mr. Stone to the conference room. Mr. Gaudin is expecting both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is?\u201d Puzzled, Shauna glanced over at Danyon, wondering if he\u2019d somehow managed to call ahead and let August know they were coming.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, he shrugged, indicating he had no idea how August knew.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Rita said, then motioned for them to follow her. \u201cMr. Gaudin is already in the conference room. He\u2019s on a call at the moment, but he insisted I bring both of you to him the moment you arrived.\u201d</p><p>They followed Rita down a long, wide hallway, a runner of plush beige carpet stretching along the oakwood floor.</p><p>Shauna felt a little awkward walking beside Danyon. She\u2019d acted like a child earlier and was embarrassed about it. Figuring the adult thing to do was probably apologize, she sneaked a peek at him out of the corner of her eye to get a handle on his mood. He was stern-faced, eyes locked forward. As far as he was concerned, she might as well have been in another parish.</p> <p>Maybe later for that apology.</p><p>Maybe.</p><p>Rita led them to a set of heavy double doors, then opened one and motioned them inside. The room held a mahogany conference table, massive and oval and surrounded by twelve leather wing-back chairs. In the south corner of the room, near the back, stood a standard-size mahogany desk. August stood beside it, phone to his ear. He nodded an acknowledgment when he saw them.</p><p>\u201cMake certain it is taken care of immediately,\u201d he said to whoever was on the other end of the line, then he turned slightly, listening intently.</p><p>Even in profile, the elder was a formidable figure.</p><p>He was shorter than Danyon, although not by much. His silvery-white, shoulder-length hair was a testament to his age, but his stature, the breadth and depth of his chest and shoulders, and his large strong hands appeared to be in direct opposition, for they were appropriate to a much younger man. August\u2019s presence radiated a quiet confidence and wisdom, but when called for, he elicited fear just as easily. He was an attorney by trade and had been elected to the city commission, and also worked with the tourism board. Shauna had always been impressed by his accomplishments, but that wasn\u2019t what bonded her to him.</p><p>August was the leader of all the werewolves through out the South, and certainly the fact that she was Keeper of the werewolves in this city had something to do with the kinship they shared. But the connection between them ran much deeper than that.</p><p>August had fought alongside her parents in their struggle to avert the great war between the races, and when they died, he immediately took Fiona, Caitlin and Shauna under his wing. He\u2019d raised them as his own. Taught them what it meant to be Keepers. Made sure they were well educated, well fed, loved and protected. He was like a grandfather to Shauna, and each time he looked at her with those gentle, powder blue eyes she felt unconditionally loved. They might not have been bio logically connected, but sharing DNA never assured anyone of love.</p> <p>As soon as August hung up the phone, Shauna walked over and gave him a hug. He returned it warmly.</p><p>\u201cWould anyone care for something to drink?\u201d Rita asked, still standing at the threshold of the room.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>Danyon, who was standing at the far end of the conference table, shook his head. \u201cNothing for me, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be all, Rita,\u201d August said.</p><p>Rita nodded and quietly backed out of the room, shutting the door behind her.</p><p>August put an arm around Shauna\u2019s shoulder and led her to the table. After pulling out a chair for her, he motioned to Danyon. \u201cPlease, make yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>When everyone was seated, Shauna asked, \u201cRita said you were expecting us, August. How did you know we were coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple logic,\u201d August said, \u201cI heard about the deaths half an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom whom?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>\u201cRayo Black, one of the bartenders at Jumani\u2019s. Apparently he was working when Andrea went into the bar looking for Andy Saville. Rayo saw how upset she was and offered her a drink to calm her nerves. He claimed after Andrea downed a couple, she began to cry and told him about the dead weres. He called me immediately. Since the weres were from Danyon\u2019s pack, and since you, Shauna, are their Keeper, it was only logical that the two of you would come to me.\u201d</p><p>August sighed deeply, propped his elbows on the table and steepled his fingers. \u201cDetails, please,\u201d he said to Danyon. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>For the next forty minutes Danyon relayed the details of how Simon and Nicole were discovered, who had found them, and the condition of their bodies when found. He also told August about his decision to hide the bodies so passersby wouldn\u2019t stumble on them, and that he\u2019d summoned Andy Saville to help with the transfer after dark.</p><p>Hearing it all again, Shauna\u2019s anger sparked anew. She still couldn\u2019t believe someone had actually killed the young weres. The emotions hammering her must have been minuscule in comparison to August\u2019s, though. As he listened to Danyon, the elder\u2019s eyes went from powder blue to cobalt. His lips drew into a thin, tight line. Shauna noticed his neck muscles ripple; then, like a wave in motion, that ripple traveled across his chin and up to his cheeks. He was fighting transformation.</p><p>Ever since Shauna was a child, she\u2019d known August to be master over his human form and his werewolf identity. Not once had she ever seen his emotions overtake him and the transformation occur spontaneously. He had always been in control. It was understandable that August would be upset about the were deaths, but for the news to have this great an effect on him, there had to be more going on in his head than processing what he\u2019d just heard.</p><p>Danyon leaned across the table. \u201cI plan on examining the bodies more closely before they\u2019re returned to their families. Something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave them taken to my lake house in LaPlace,\u201d August said sharply. \u201cI want to see them for myself. Do you remember how to get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t that house damaged during Hurricane Katrina?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s been renovated, and I had a large workshop built beside it. Forty by forty, plenty of fluorescent lighting. Andy can bring Nicole and Simon there. I\u2019ll take care of notifying the families, as well. Although I\u2019d be surprised if news hasn\u2019t already reached them by now.\u201d August turned to Danyon. \u201cYou were about to say more before I interrupted. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that something occurred to me when I was on my way here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Nicole and Simon had obvious wounds from being declawed and defanged, but I didn\u2019t notice anything that specifically pointed to the cause of death. No gunshot wound or blunt force trauma. There was a lot of blood, but I don\u2019t believe either of them bled out. The silver wire used on Nicole\u2014and I suspect on Simon, as well\u2014definitely did some damage. Burned right through fur, flesh and muscle. But as torturous as that sounds, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s what caused Nicole\u2019s death. Simon\u2019s either. They may have been stabbed, but I won\u2019t know that for sure until I examine the bodies. But, August, the bigger question is how is it possible that both remained in were-state after they died? I\u2019ve never witnessed that before. Never even heard it was possible. Have you?\u201d</p><p>August bowed his head, pushed away from the table and slowly got to his feet. He walked over to an occasional table that stood against a far wall beneath a six-foot painting of St. Louis Cathedral. On the table sat a crystal pitcher filled with ice water and surrounded by six crystal tumblers. August filled one of the tumblers with water, lifted it to his lips and drank slowly until it was drained.</p><p>Shauna had never seen August act this way, and it frightened her.</p><p>After setting the empty glass back on the occasional table, August turned toward them. His face had gone from grave to gray. \u201cYes, I have witnessed the phenomenon before.\u201d</p><p>He walked back to the head of the conference table, but instead of sitting, he paced slowly back and forth, like a lecturer preparing to give a speech. When August finally spoke, his voice was low and distant, the voice of a man pulling up a memory that he would prefer not disinter. \u201cI witnessed the kind of death you mentioned nearly six decades ago. I was in Romania at the time. A group of local weres had captured a rogue were\u2014a wolven, as it happened\u2014who\u2019d been responsible for the mutilation and deaths of three human children. He was brought before the were-council, and it didn\u2019t take long for them to pronouce him guilty and sentence him to death. I concurred with the council\u2019s decision, of course, as did the magistrate who was serving at the time. But the magistrate wanted the rogue\u2019s execution to be as severe as his crime.\u201d</p><p>August took a deep breath, stopped pacing, and faced them. \u201cHe had the rogue bound in silver and steel, then beaten relentlessly while the silver burned through his flesh. Of course that intense pain created the emotional state that was needed to force his transformation. As soon as the transformation was complete, he was stripped of his claws and fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cHow did that serve as an execution? Did he bleed to death?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. The manner of death was far worse. You see, there is a metaphysical power inherent to a werewolf\u2019s claws and fangs. That power is so potent that when they are torn abruptly from the body, the were undergoes a molecular restructuring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>\u201cThe cells of the body begin to pressurize, which automatically seals the body in were-state,\u201d August explained. \u201cThe cells continue to pressurize until the body mimics a pressure cooker, except without a release valve. Eventually the pressure becomes so great that the were\u2019s heart literally bursts.\u201d</p> <p>Shauna slumped in her chair, overwhelmed by the thought of such a horrible death. She glanced over at Danyon. He was sitting ramrod straight, hands on the table, his fingers laced together and white-knuckled. The expression on his face looked treacherous, hard and cold.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d August continued, \u201ceven back then, I was no innocent regarding death. I had seen far too many die in battle. But I will never forget the sounds of agony that came from that rogue. It was, and still is, indescribable. It affected everyone who was there, every council member. Even the magistrate.\u201d August looked over at the portrait of the cathedral, kept his gaze there. \u201cThat wolven screamed...pleaded. He cried for mercy so loudly...I didn\u2019t think any being had the vocal capacity to produce such volume. And it would change from howls to human screams to...something...\u201d</p><p>August turned to them, his eyes dull with sadness and regret. \u201cThe look of terror on that rogue\u2019s face...if ever a being looked death square in the face, he did. That look remained on his face even after his heart burst, as though even death itself gave him no relief.\u201d</p><p>Shauna leaned forward, put a fist to her mouth and slowly shook her head. She couldn\u2019t imagine Nicole and Simon suffering that way.</p><p>August returned to his chair. He looked utterly drained.</p> <p>They sat in silence, everyone seemingly at a loss for words.</p><p>Shauna\u2019s mind played reruns of Nicole and Ian at the shop. The two laughing\u2014talking\u2014holding hands. Nicole\u2019s smile, how it flashed in her eyes and lit up her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy them, August?\u201d Shauna asked quietly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Simon very well, but Nicole...she wasn\u2019t a threat to anyone. Why them?\u201d</p><p>The elder shook his head. \u201cChances are it had little or nothing to do with whether or not they were threats. My guess is that Simon and Nicole were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRandom killings? In that manner? Then it would have to be someone who knew about the molecular restructuring. Still, why would they choose that manner of death? There are easier ways to kill a were. Are we dealing with a lunatic? Somebody who gets his kicks from seeing others suffer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lunatic or someone killing for recreation,\u201d August said. \u201cThe metaphysical power in the claws and fangs can affect others, as well. Not just the victim. Because of its potency, it only has to be ingested by another being, and he or she becomes empowered with the same traits as a werewolf. Not transformation, but strength, speed, agility, heightened senses, even sexual prowess.\u201d</p> <p>Shauna spotted Danyon throwing a glance her way.</p><p>Then he cleared his throat and asked, \u201cHow would someone ingest claws and fangs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy pulverizing them to fine powder,\u201d August said. \u201cThe killer may be doing this simply for profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA drug dealer?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cIn essence, yes,\u201d August said. \u201cThe one advantage we have is that the metaphysical power is not common knowledge. It\u2019s usually kept within the council. So it is possible that the killer may only be someone hunting trinkets, the way a trapper collects bear claws and alligator teeth, then sells them as jewelry. We can only hope that is the case. If not, if we are dealing with someone who understands the power involved, then the death count will grow astronomically. Once this person, this...being, realizes the financial potential, there will be no stopping him. Needless to say, it is crucial that the information I have shared with you not leave this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t.\u201d Danyon got to his feet, his hands curling into fists at his sides. \u201cI\u2019ll find whoever\u2019s responsible for Nicole and Simon\u2019s death. The reason for the killings doesn\u2019t matter. The murderer will be stopped, and if I have your permission, he\u2019ll be stopped by any means necessary.\u201d</p><p>August nodded. \u201cYou have my permission. But understand this, Danyon. If it is as I fear, more murders will follow so quickly, all the alphas in this territory combined may not be able to stop it.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran up Shauna\u2019s spine, and she prayed it wasn\u2019t another intuitive whisper. But somewhere deep in her heart, she suspected her prayers would be futile.</p> <p>For August\u2019s words rang far too true.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to come,\u201d Danyon said to Shauna, for what seemed like the fiftieth time since they\u2019d left August\u2019s office.</p><p>\u201cAnd I said I am coming,\u201d she said\u2014again.</p><p>As if he\u2019d expected anything different.</p><p>August had advised Shauna against going to the murder site, saying that there was no reason for her to subject herself to such gruesomeness. But she\u2019d dug her heels in, refusing to be deterred. \u201cI\u2019m their Keeper,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m to fully understand what\u2019s going on, I have to see it firsthand.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, August hadn\u2019t ordered Shauna to stay away as Danyon had hoped. And so far, every form of persuasion he\u2019d tried to keep her from coming had failed.</p><p>Danyon had traveled to August\u2019s office on foot, and he\u2019d planned to return to Simon and Nicole the same way, especially after he heard August\u2019s accounting of the rogue were\u2019s execution so many years ago. Danyon hadn\u2019t been able to shake the mental images that had formed, images of how Simon and Nicole must have suffered before they died. He needed to run to clear his head. As a human, running was therapeutic for him. As a were, it was his one saving grace when he was on emotional overload. The last thing he needed to deal with right now was a fainting female.</p><p>Regardless of how attractive she was.</p><p>Even if they took shortcuts through alleyways and cemeteries, it was still three miles from August\u2019s to River Road. Walking that distance would take too long, but Danyon refused to give the stubborn strawberry blonde the satisfaction of riding in a cab. Besides, he didn\u2019t want any cab driver, human or otherwise, even close to the sites. He had to make sure word about the deaths didn\u2019t get out until it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>Frustrated, but having no other option except to tolerate her tagging along, Danyon had started their journey off with a brisk walk, then quickly cranked it up to a jog. Finally, he warned Shauna that he had to move faster, and if she planned to follow, she had to either keep up or be left behind. With that, he\u2019d sped off in a full run.</p><p>They were already two miles into the run, and Shauna had kept pace with him every step of the way. Danyon couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by her stamina. She wasn\u2019t even breathing hard. Her reflexes remained sharp. If he cut hard to the right, she was immediately at his side. If he veered left without notice, she matched the move instantly and without effort.</p><p>Three quarters of a mile from the levees, Shauna suddenly pulled up short. \u201cI hear a motor. Sounds like a car engine idling.\u201d</p><p>As though her words sharpened his own hearing, Danyon\u2019s ears suddenly perked to the sound. He glanced over at her, curious as to how she\u2019d heard anything. They were still a decent distance from River Road. Close enough to hear a revving engine, maybe, but an idling one? No way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s Saville,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cI sent Andrea to find him and have him bring back supplies and his SUV, so we can move the bodies.\u201d</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Danyon would have contacted the coroner about the deaths, then the coroner would have dispatched one of his assistants to make the pickup. But normal meant Simon and Nicole would have been in human form. The fact that they remained in were-state called for a different strategy.</p><p>They reached River Road before Danyon had a chance to ask how she\u2019d heard the idling engine, so he tucked the question away for later. As he\u2019d suspected, Andy\u2019s black SUV was parked on the side of the road facing the levee.</p><p>Andy got out of the SUV as soon as he spotted them. He was taller than Danyon and twice his weight and bulk. His skin was the color of slate, and his thick black hair was braided in multiple rows, each braid hanging down to the middle of his back.</p><p>\u201cWhat you got, boss?\u201d Andy asked.</p><p>\u201cA nasty clean up,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cAnd I need you to keep quiet about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZipped lip, boss, you know me.\u201d Andy looked over at Shauna, and Danyon saw from his expression that he thought her being there was a huge mistake. Although Danyon agreed, he had to respect the fact that she was their Keeper.</p><p>Andy gave her a short nod. \u201cMs. MacDonald.\u201d</p><p>Shauna returned the greeting. \u201cAndy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Andrea?\u201d Danyon asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe kid was bad off. Really upset. So I told her to stay put, have a drink to calm herself down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call. Did you bring the tarps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it. Andrea told me you said messy, and metal, too, so I brought wire cutters, a hacksaw, gloves, stuff like that. Oh, yeah, and flashlights.\u201d Andy leaned into the open driver\u2019s window of the SUV and pulled out two Maglites.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Danyon grabbed both, turned one of them on and aimed it at the thicket about three hundred feet away. \u201cGet one of the tarps and meet us over there.\u201d</p><p>Andy nodded and headed for the back of the SUV.</p><p>\u201cReady or not,\u201d Danyon said to Shauna, then signaled for her to follow.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Paul?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s supposed to be keeping watch over there.\u201d</p><p>When they got halfway to the thicket, Paul came running out of the shadows. \u201cMan, am I glad to see\u2014\u201d He did a double take when he saw Shauna, looked back at Danyon. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want us to tell nobody?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shauna jumped in before he had a chance to answer. \u201cYou know I\u2019m the wolvens\u2019 Keeper, Paul,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that I be involved in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...okay.\u201d</p><p>Grateful that they didn\u2019t have to explain further, Danyon asked Paul, \u201cAny problems?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust that you took too long. Other than that, nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Danyon held a flashlight out to Paul. \u201cHang on to this. When we get back there, I\u2019ll need you to aim the light where I tell you. I want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we get back where?\u201d Paul asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cTo Simon. I want to take a closer look at his body, make sure we\u2019re not missing any\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Paul jumped back as if the flashlight was ready to strike out and bite. \u201cWhy...why you gotta do that? They\u2019re gonna do all the examin\u2019 over at the morgue, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot with Simon in that condition they\u2019re not,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cWe can\u2019t let anyone see him that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut somebody\u2019s gonna start asking where Simon\u2019s at anyway,\u201d Paul said, pacing a short, two-step path. \u201cSomebody\u2019s gotta eventually see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord will get out to the wolven soon enough, but nobody else needs to know right now. We take care of our own, remember? I\u2019ll make sure Simon\u2019s well taken care of, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>Paul whimpered and paced faster, almost spinning in place. \u201cDanyon, I\u2014I know...I know we need to take care of him. I know we gotta, but I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m\u2014I been sittin\u2019 here like you said. I been doin\u2019 good, so don\u2019t make me, okay? D-Don\u2019t make me hold the light. P-Please, I can\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t make me hold the light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d Shauna said. She held a hand out to Danyon. \u201cI\u2019ll help with the flashlight and whatever else you need help with. Looks like Paul\u2019s been through enough today. Maybe he should go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, like she said.\u201d Paul gave an enthusiastic nod. \u201cI should go home. Like now, okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to see this,\u201d Danyon said to Shauna. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s far from pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I wanted pleasant, you think I\u2019d be here?\u201d Her hand still extended, she wiggled her fingers. \u201cI\u2019m doing it, so you might as well hand over the light.\u201d</p><p>The determination on her face told Danyon any further discussion would be futile. He sighed, then signaled to Paul that it was okay for him to leave. The young were didn\u2019t have to be told twice. He was gone in a nanosecond, obviously scared Danyon might change his mind.</p><p>\u201cYou sure about this?\u201d Danyon held a flashlight out to Shauna.</p><p>She took it from him. \u201cPositive. Now where\u2019s Simon?\u201d</p><p>He aimed his flashlight to the right. There was no missing the small arc of blood near the edge of the thicket. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot the tarp, boss,\u201d Andy said, coming up behind them. \u201cWhere you want it?\u201d</p><p>Danyon redirected the beam of light. \u201cStretch it out on that patch of grass. We\u2019ll lay the body on it once we get it out of the thicket.\u201d</p> <p>Andy paused mid-step, and Danyon could almost hear his thoughts.</p><p>Body? Thicket?</p><p>To the man\u2019s credit, Andy snapped back into action and did as he was told without saying another word.</p><p>When the tarp was in place, Danyon handed Shauna his flashlight. \u201cCan you manage both? I need two hands to help pull him out.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, looking a little green around the gills.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...fine.\u201d</p><p>Suspecting she had chosen bravery over telling the absolute truth, Danyon headed for the thicket.</p><p>\u201cThe body\u2019s under heavy brush, so we won\u2019t be able to lift it,\u201d he said to Andy. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to each take a leg and pull him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Andy said.</p><p>Danyon squatted beside the arc of blood. \u201cHere. Just reach in and grab hold.\u201d He didn\u2019t have to instruct Shauna on lighting. She already had both flashlights aimed perfectly.</p><p>Andy hurried to Danyon\u2019s side, dropped to his knees and reached into the thick brush.</p><p>Finding Simon\u2019s right ankle, Danyon wrapped both hands around it, glanced over at Andy. \u201cReady. You?\u201d</p><p>A frown had settled over Andy\u2019s face. \u201cUh...yeah, but something don\u2019t feel right, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just pull on the count of three, okay?\u201d</p><p>Andy nodded, then bit down on his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cOne, two...three.\u201d</p><p>The body slid out a lot more easily than it had gone in. Once it was in full view, a beam of light settled over Simon\u2019s face, and Danyon heard Shauna gasp.</p><p>\u201cSweet mother of pearl,\u201d Andy said, breathing hard, his voice a hoarse whisper. He dropped Simon\u2019s leg and quickly scrubbed his hands on his jeans.</p><p>Suddenly blinded by light, Danyon threw the back of a hand over his eyes. \u201cHey, Shauna, light!\u201d</p><p>\u201cS-Sorry,\u201d she said, and corrected her aim. \u201cI\u2014I...</p><p>God, he\u2014\u201d Her mouth snapped shut, and Danyon understood. Sometimes, when faced with something horrible, it seemed a little ridiculous to state the obvious.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move him onto the tarp,\u201d Danyon said to Andy.</p><p>\u201cYou take his feet. I\u2019ll grab under his arms. Then we lift on go.\u201d</p><p>Stationing himself at Simon\u2019s head, Danyon locked his hands under Simon\u2019s arms, then he nodded and waited for Andy to grab both ankles before counting down and saying, \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>In less than a minute, they had Simon settled on the tarp. Shauna stepped closer but stood over to one side, so the flashlight beams weren\u2019t obstructed by Andy\u2019s head.</p><p>Her eyes were wide, and she, too, was breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it, boss...I don\u2019t get it,\u201d Andy said. \u201cHow come he\u2019s still...?\u201d He glanced over at Shauna, then back at Danyon. He lowered his voice. \u201cHow come he\u2019s still were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to whisper, Andy. She sees him, too. She knew about it before she even got here.\u201d</p><p>Andy nodded as if he understood completely, but the furrows in his brow said differently.</p><p>\u201cThe fact that he\u2019s still were is what has to stay quiet,\u201d Danyon said to him. \u201cIt stays on the QT until we have a chance to figure out what happened and who\u2019s involved. Got it?\u201d.</p><p>\"Yeah.\u201d</p><p>No matter how hard he\u2019d tried to steel himself, seeing Simon\u2019s body again had kicked up a cloud of emotions in Danyon. He saw the same thing happening to Andy, so he cleared his throat to get the man\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cGet the hacksaw and wire cutters, will you, Andy? Gloves, too.\u201d</p><p>When Andy left to get the supplies, Danyon looked over at Shauna. She was standing ramrod straight, arms out, flashlights swaying.</p><p>\u201cWhy him?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cWhy do you think they chose Simon? I mean, look at him. There\u2019s so much blood. I don\u2019t understand how anyone could do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Andy said, returning with a large duffle bag. He set the bag on the ground, opened it and pulled out a hacksaw. Without saying another word, he took the saw and went to work on the cable wrapped around Simon\u2019s ankle.</p><p>The sound of metal shrieking against metal made Danyon cringe. He dug through the duffle, found a package of latex gloves and two pairs of work gloves. He chose the latex, opened the package and slipped on a pair. Then he walked over, positioned himself near Simon\u2019s head and started working his fingers through the blood dried fur, feeling for other wounds.</p><p>The shriek of metal seemed to go on forever as Andy cut through layer after layer of thick cable. When he finally cut all the way through, he breathed a choice expletive and sat back on his haunches.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Danyon asked, getting to his feet. So far, save for the missing fangs and claws, he\u2019d found no other wounds.</p><p>Andy pointed to Simon\u2019s ankles. \u201cLook at that. Like the kid didn\u2019t go through enough.\u201d</p><p>Danyon signaled for Shauna to bring him one of the flashlights, then he knelt at Simon\u2019s feet and aimed the light where Andy had indicated. As he\u2019d suspected, a thin, silver wire had been wound about Simon\u2019s ankles beneath the cable. Not enough silver to kill him, but enough to burn through fur, flesh and muscle before lodging into bone.</p><p>As he studied the damage, Danyon heard a deep guttural sound, felt its vibration, heard it change quickly to a low growl. And he knew all too well what it meant.</p><p>Anger over the injustice of what was laid out before him was getting to Andy. Without intervention, it would soon take over and force his transformation to were. Once that happened, the anger would turn into full blown rage, causing Andy to lash out at anything within clawing distance. Including Shauna.</p><p>\u201cSteady, Andy,\u201d Danyon warned.</p><p>\u201cSteady as she blows, boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded like you were getting a little itchy on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot itchy one bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019ve got to keep a handle on it. I need you.</p><p>And I need you with a cool, clear head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s clear, boss,\u201d Andy said, his voice now raspy. It was already changing tenor. \u201cIt\u2019s clear I\u2019m gonna kill the sonofabitch that did this to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...Danyon...?\u201d</p><p>Danyon heard Shauna, but didn\u2019t dare turn toward her. Not only had Andy\u2019s voice changed, his forehead had begun to protrude, and his neck muscles were bulging. If he lost Andy\u2019s attention now, he knew he would have a seriously pissed-off were on his hands. And given Andy\u2019s size, he would probably have to kill him to stop him.</p><p>Danyon quickly stripped off the latex gloves, tossed them to the ground, then grabbed Andy by the forearms, forcing him to look into his eyes. Andy growled and snapped at him, incisors already twice the length of a human\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Squeezing hard, Danyon dug his fingers into Andy\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2014need\u2014you\u2014to\u2014focus,\u201d he enunciated, his own voice low and hard. \u201cHold it together. I command it! Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Andy snarled, snapping at him again.</p><p>Pressing his fingers deeper into Andy\u2019s arms, Danyon let out a deep guttural growl. A warning that his own transformation was imminent. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d</p> <p>Evidently recognizing the voice of his alpha, Andy\u2019s eyes suddenly cleared, and his incisors withdrew. He immediately lowered his head.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go and sit in the SUV,\u201d Danyon commanded. \u201cWait for me there. When I\u2019m finished looking over the body, I\u2019ll wrap it in the tarp, then you\u2019ll help me load it into the SUV. Until then, you\u2019re to stay in the driver\u2019s seat until I call for you. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>Andy gave one quick nod, then quietly hurried away as ordered.</p><p>Danyon breathed a silent sigh of relief. He hadn\u2019t feared Andy\u2019s transformation for himself. He\u2019d feared it for Shauna. As angry as Andy had become, there might have been no controlling who or what he attacked. Chances were good that he would have taken on the feral madness of a vengeful wolven, its mind lost to understanding anything but destruction.</p><p>Danyon turned to Shauna, saw an expression on her face he couldn\u2019t quite define.</p> <p>Fear? Awe? Possibly both.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just another reason why you should have stayed away,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky. No telling what might have happened if I hadn\u2019t stopped his transformation.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him steadily. \u201cI\u2019m his Keeper,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have harmed me.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her standing there\u2014tall, slender, delicate wrists and arms, long, beautiful neck\u2014and knew Andy would have snapped her like a twig. Danyon might have laughed at the absurdity of her statement had it not been for the way she said it. Not haughty, like someone acting too big for her britches. It sounded confident, like the voice of experience. That puzzled him. When had she ever been up against a raging were? He shook off the question. Now wasn\u2019t the time to contemplate the matter. He had more serious issues to contend with.</p><p>He headed back to Simon\u2019s body. \u201cI\u2019ll need more light over here.\u201d</p><p>Shauna hurried over, directed the flashlights as he indicated. As light flooded over Simon\u2019s body, she let out another, smaller gasp.</p> <p>Danyon chose to ignore it. No time for emotional females. It was already late, and they still had Nicole to see to. He scrounged through the duffle bag again, and grabbed wire cutters and a pair of pliers. He snipped the silver wire wrapped around Simon\u2019s ankles with the cutters, then, using the pliers, he carefully wiggled the wire free from the trench it had formed in the bone.</p><p>With that task complete, Danyon reached for the hacksaw and went to work on the remaining cables, the ones wrapped around Simon\u2019s neck and chest.</p><p>It was a long and tedious process, sawing at awkward angles, blade slipping again and again until he managed to cut a thin rut in the cable. Sweat ran into his eyes, soaked the back of his shirt.</p><p>By the time Danyon had removed the cables and the additional silver wire he\u2019d found beneath them, two hours had vanished. It dawned on him, too, that throughout that entire time, Shauna had not said one word.</p><p>He looked up to check on her and was surprised to find her sitting back on her haunches beside him.</p><p>She handed him a pair of latex gloves. \u201cThought you might be ready for these.\u201d</p><p>He studied her face, saw no trace of fear. Only profound sadness.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and took the gloves from her. After slipping them on, he sank his fingers into the fur on Simon\u2019s right leg, then worked them slowly upward, feeling for wounds.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this was done by a human,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d He kept his fingers moving. \u201cThe minute that silver touched him, he would\u2019ve mutated instantly from the pain, then slaughtered anyone in sight. And if by chance he was in were-state before they used the silver...they never would have gotten close enough to wrap it around any part of his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a group of humans?\u201d</p><p>Danyon shook his head. \u201cNot even an army of three-hundred-pound men. Once a wolven is at full power, even a young one like Simon, all they have to do is backhand a man, and the strength of that blow would crush his face. One swipe from his claws, and the man\u2019s chest is ripped open, his heart pierced. And even if it had been a hundred men, all attacking at the same time, Simon wasn\u2019t stupid. At the first hint he was being overpowered, he would have fled, and a wolven\u2019s too fast and agile for any human to catch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about shifters, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if shifters mentally paired with a wolven, then became wolven themselves, couldn\u2019t they have overpowered Simon? Or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the shifters from here. They can transform into any being through molecular mapping, but only in appearance. They wouldn\u2019t possess the full power of a wolven. Maybe three quarters at best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they morphed into something bigger than a wolven? Wouldn\u2019t size alone give them power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but in order for them to transform into anything, they have to see it, mentally map it.\u201d Danyon arched a brow. \u201cHave you ever seen anything in New Orleans\u2014hell, in the entire state of Louisiana, that was bigger than a full grown wolven?\u201d</p><p>Shauna pursed her lips and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cMe either. That\u2019s why I think the scenerio\u2019s doubtful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...vampires? I don\u2019t think one could\u2019ve done it alone. But two or three might have, if they glamoured Simon before he turned were, then restrained him with silver and cable and lifted the glamour. You said Simon would have morphed from the pain caused by the silver, right? Well, once he turned were, all they had to do was...what was done to him.\u201d</p><p>Through with the examination, Danyon stripped off the gloves and tossed them onto the tarp. He\u2019d found no other wounds that might have caused Simon\u2019s death. He could only assume it was as August had said\u2014Simon\u2019s heart had burst. Unfortunately, an autopsy couldn\u2019t be performed to confirm it. Not with Simon still in were-state.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>Danyon got to his feet and began gathering tools. \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s probable. Nicole and Simon were found during the day and judging by the condition of their bodies, they\u2019d probably only been dead about four or five hours. That means the murders took place during the day, as well. The local vampires can move about in daylight, but they\u2019re considerably weaker than they are at night.\u201d He shook his head slowly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the answer is, Shauna. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if it wasn\u2019t humans, shape-shifters or vampires, that leaves us with...other weres. Other wolven.\u201d</p><p>He looked away.</p><p>\u201cIs that possible?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>Danyon glanced over at Simon\u2019s body. He didn\u2019t want to entertain the idea that the murderer was a wolven. Of course wolven fought, sometimes to the death, but they didn\u2019t purposely torture their own.</p><p>\u201cDanyon, I think we need to get the leaders from the other races involved in this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Shauna got to her feet. \u201cIsn\u2019t it better to swallow a little pride than lose more weres?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about pride,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to have the three biggest subcultures in New Orleans pointing fingers at one another again. It\u2019s like you said earlier about the cemetery murders and the walk-ins. You were right. Every group blamed every other group. Even though both cases have been solved, that wire between all three groups is still taut. Getting the other leaders involved would mean their people would find out, and you know it. Fingers would start pointing again, only this time, that wire might very well snap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>Danyon held up a hand. \u201cLook, I know two heads are better than one, three better than two, yada, yada, yada.</p><p>But Simon and Nicole were my responsibility. They died on my watch. I have to find their murderer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all the weres\u2014including the wolven\u2014are my responsibility. We have to do what\u2019s right for the entire community.\u201d</p><p>Danyon knew she was right, but there was something in him that simply refused to admit it at that moment. Call it pride, determination, the word didn\u2019t matter. Nicole and Simon shouldn\u2019t have died. He should have been there to protect them. He needed to find who\u2014or what\u2014had murdered them.</p><p>\u201cTwelve hours,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least give me that. If I don\u2019t come up with something by then, we\u2019ll call in the others, okay?\u201d</p><p>Shauna studied him for a long while, then said, \u201cAll right. Twelve hours.\u201d With that, she turned and headed toward the SUV.</p><p>Danyon watched her walk away, suspecting she feared she\u2019d made a mistake in allowing him the time he\u2019d asked for.</p><p>He understood.</p><p>Because in that moment, he feared the exact same thing.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Lightning ripped a jagged tear through the night sky, and the thunderclap that followed shook the ground beneath Shauna\u2019s feet. She felt the first few spatters of rain on her head, her shoulders. Fat, wet drops that promised many more.</p><p>Shauna glanced up at the sky, wishing for it to burst open and wash her, bath her in luxurious warmth and take away the spatters of blood on her clothes, the dirt on her hands, the emotional weight on her heart.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt more exhausted in her life. It wasn\u2019t that she\u2019d tackled anything physically laborious, but being so close to Simon and Nicole while Danyon examined them, watching as his fingers worked through bloody fur, had taken a greater toll on her than she\u2019d thought.</p><p>The entire time she\u2019d held the flashlight, Shauna wondered why both weres had to suffer such horrible deaths. She thought of their families and the pain and sorrow awaiting them. So many whys, too many questions. Who was she supposed to go to for answers? How could anyone explain the unfairness of the universe when it presented life this way? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Some questions in life simply had no answers; that much Shauna knew. But to her, not having answers to such grievous questions was almost as unbearable as the situation that prompted them in the first place.</p><p>Once Simon had been loaded into the SUV, she\u2019d helped Danyon clear the area of bloody clothes, anything that might cause a passerby to take notice and call the police. Shauna had thought that after helping with Simon, she\u2019d built up enough emotional stamina to handle Nicole.</p><p>She\u2019d been wrong.</p> <p>Although Nicole had died in the same manner as Simon and had also remained in were-state, there was something in her eyes that looked all too human. Shock\u2014terror\u2014innocence lost forever. That look had literally dropped Shauna to her knees. She\u2019d openly wept while Danyon examined the young were. It was incomprehensible how anyone could kill something so fragile. To make matters worse, Nicole\u2019s body had been hidden away in an alley behind wooden crates, since there was no brush anywhere near the pilings. Seeing her slumped in a heap in that alley, like so much garbage, made the emotional stress ten times worse.</p><p>The only thing that had comforted Shauna that night was seeing how gently and respectfully Danyon had cared for both weres. His large, powerful hands had moved so gently over their bodies. Nicole had been small enough for him to lift on his own, so Danyon had carried her to the back of the SUV, cradling her in his arms like a child.</p><p>Danyon had Andy remain in the truck while they\u2019d tended to Nicole, refusing to let Andy even see her. That had been a wise decision. As angry as Andy had gotten when he saw Simon, had he seen Nicole, Shauna feared he would have been beyond even Danyon\u2019s control. She was confident that August would know how to handle Andy once he arrived at the lake house and had to unload the bodies.</p><p>Now, the only evidence that remained to prove Nicole had even been in the alley or between the pilings were bloodstains. If the rain didn\u2019t wash them away, time would.</p><p>Another zipper of lightning raced across the sky.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do here,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cWe should go before the storm really lets loose.\u201d</p><p>Shauna hadn\u2019t thought about how she\u2019d get home once this was over. A cab made the most sense, but they were scarce in this area, even at midday, and non-existent in the wee hours of morning, which it now was. Barataria was a good distance from the Quarter, but walking there was not an option. Just the thought of trudging across a street right now made Shauna want to collapse. She could barely put one foot in front of the other as it was.</p><p>\u201cMy place isn\u2019t that far from here,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cMuch closer than yours. You\u2019re welcome to hang out there until the storm passes. Maybe grab a shower, have something to eat while you wait.\u201d</p><p>Although she\u2019d give anything for a hot shower and a cheeseburger right now, Shauna didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea for her to go to Danyon\u2019s. Being alone with him sounded too tempting. She wanted to say no. The rain, her exhaustion, the distance between here and her home, the convenient closeness of his place\u2014all of it felt like one big clich\u00e9. Like the guy whose car just happens to run out of gas on a deserted road on the first date.</p><p>Still, when he\u2019d invited her, she\u2019d felt something tug at her core, urging her to go. She needed to say no, had to resist\u2014wanted to maintain control\u2014but found herself nodding yes, instead. Albeit reluctantly.</p><p>Food and a shower, nothing wrong with that, right? She could do both, then head home as soon as the storm let up. Easy-peasy, chillin\u2019 cheesy.</p> <p>Shauna repeated the name of those two food groups as she followed him home.</p><p>They walked for what felt like hours. Long enough for her mind to go numb and her body even more numb. Every once in a while, as they walked, Shauna found herself leaning against Danyon without meaning to. The moment their bodies touched, however, she\u2019d quickly straighten, determined to keep a respectable distance between them.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for the sky to release its payload, drenching them in wet, warm sheets. Still, they walked, casually, purposely taking their time, as though the night were dry and cool.</p><p>Before Shauna knew it, they were at the corner of Burgundy and Ursulines and standing under an awning at the back entrance to La Maison Pierre. She was familiar with the old, five-storey hotel, having gone past it a few times on her morning runs.</p><p>Danyon tapped a code into the lock-pad near the door.</p><p>\u201cYou live in this hotel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI own it.\u201d He pushed the door open.</p><p>Shauna arched a brow. La Maison Pierre\u2014The Stone House. Interesting...</p> <p>They took a private elevator up to the fifth floor. There, Danyon led her down a short hallway to a massive, ornate wooden door, where he tapped yet another code into another lock-pad.</p><p>He opened the door and motioned Shauna inside. \u201cMake yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>Everything about the spacious, multi-room penthouse spoke of luxury. Twelve-foot ceilings with double crown molding, plush designer rugs over wide-planked wood floors, antiques from the Louis XIV era, a huge fireplace with a fluted mantel, and paintings that looked like works by Rembrandt and Van Gogh.</p><p>\u201cYou live here alone?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, unless you count Raul. He checks in a few times a day to make sure I haven\u2019t turned the place into a total pigsty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s head of housekeeping here at the hotel.\u201d</p><p>Danyon led her down another hallway to a large bathroom with gray and white marble floors. It had a granite double-sink vanity and shower stall, and a whirlpool tub that was big enough for six. Plush, white towels hung from a wide, wooden towel rack.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to freshen up, shower, whatever you need. There are a couple of clean bathrobes in the linen closet behind the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathrobes, huh? You must do quite a bit of entertaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how little.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIf you decide to shower, you can toss your clothes out in the hall, and I\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re cleaned before you leave. When you\u2019re done, just head back the way we came, only turn right at the archway instead of left. That\u2019ll lead you to the kitchen. I\u2019ll whip up something for us to eat after I grab a quick shower.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of food, Shauna\u2019s stomach grumbled to life. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d eaten. \u201cSounds good,\u201d she said, suddenly feeling self-conscious. She must have looked like a troll.</p><p>With a smile and a nod, Danyon backed out of the bathroom, closing the door behind him.</p><p>Shauna locked the door, then leaned against it for a few seconds and closed her eyes. Thunder rumbled in the distance. Despite the deluge they had walked through moments ago, it sounded like the storm was only getting started.</p><p>Gathering up what little energy she had, Shauna opened her eyes, pushed away from the door and went to the vanity. She gasped when she saw her reflection in the mirror. She was beyond filthy. Her T-shirt, once blue, now looked like a bad Pollock imitation\u2014wet, dirt smudged, and dotted with blood spatter. Her jeans were worse than her shirt. Her face, neck and arms were dirt and mud-smeared, and it looked like she\u2019d been digging ditches with her fingernails. Seeing the filth made Nicole and Simon\u2019s faces zoom up close in her mind\u2019s eye.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t get into the shower fast enough.</p><p>Once under the hot spray, Shauna tried not to think of anything, just feel the warmth of the water flowing over her, listen to the hiss of the spray. She had no idea how long she stayed in the shower, but by the time she got out, her fingers and toes were pruned.</p><p>After drying off and combing her hair out with her fingers, she wrapped herself in one of the thick, terry cloth robes she found in the linen closet, then headed out of the bathroom in search of the kitchen.</p><p>Shauna felt a little weird trekking around Danyon\u2019s penthouse barefoot and naked beneath the robe. But better that, she figured, than stinking up the place with the dirt and grime that had covered her earlier.</p><p>She found the kitchen a few minutes later and saw Danyon standing over a stainless steel stove, stirring a pot of marinara sauce. He wore jeans, a white unbuttoned button-down and was barefoot, as well.</p><p>\u201cPasta and sauce okay?\u201d he asked. When he turned toward her, his smile faltered. His eyes traveled quickly over her body, settled on her face\u2014consumed her soul.</p><p>With her heart thundering in her chest, Shauna cleared her throat. \u201cUh, sounds good. Anything I can do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can grab a couple of plates for us if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d He aimed his chin at an upper cabinet to his left. \u201cThey\u2019re up there.\u201d</p><p>Shauna went over to the cabinet, opened it, and saw that the plates were on the uppermost shelf. She reached up and found herself inches short of the goal, which made her laugh. At five foot eight, people usually asked her to retrieve things from high shelves.</p><p>\u201cAh, sorry. I keep forgetting that the rest of the population isn\u2019t six-five.\u201d Grinning, Danyon turned the burners off on the stove and walked over to her. \u201cLet me help you with that.\u201d</p><p>Standing behind her now, Danyon reached up and over her head and plucked two plates off the shelf. Then he froze, plates still in midair.</p><p>Shauna felt like those plates, locked and hovering in space. She couldn\u2019t have moved even if she\u2019d wanted to. Although Danyon hadn\u2019t pressed against her, hadn\u2019t even touched her, she still felt heat from his body radiating through the bathrobe and onto her back. It soaked into her skin, vibrated, stole her breath. Whatever resonated between them was so strong, it blocked off the rest of the world. Shauna heard nothing but his breathing. She saw nothing\u2014felt everything. Her body suddenly ached with a need that transcended the physical, a need that encompassed her entire being. She feared even twitching lest he misread it and back away.</p><p>Danyon slowly lowered the plates and placed them on the counter just below the cabinet. As he did, Shauna felt his breath on her right cheek, and her body reacted immediately, nipples hardening, arms trembling.</p><p>\u201cShauna...\u201d His voice was huskier now, deeper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard him, but more than his voice. All of him seemed to call to her\u2014and it felt primal.</p><p>Shauna turned to face him, and in less than a second, her lips were pressed against his.</p><p>Danyon wrapped his arms around her, pulled her in close. Their kisses grew ravenous immediately, tongues probing, deeper, deeper, both craving more. His fingers traveled lightly along the nape of her neck, and Shauna moaned.</p> <p>In response, Danyon\u2019s hand moved slowly down to her shoulder, his thumb latching on to the edge of the bathrobe near her collarbone and lowering it. Then his fingers trailed lower\u2014lower still. By the time his fingertips reached the swell of her breast, the world had become a swirling kaleidoscope, and he was its fulcrum. He brushed the top of her left breast, then, keeping his touch feather-light, he moved toward her nipple. Stopping just short of the hardened nub, he circled it slowly with a finger, again and again, each time his fingers moving ever closer to her nipple, yet not...quite...touching it.</p><p>Shauna gasped with desire, wanting to scream, Now! Now! And just when the ache in her body became so excruciating she thought she could bear no more, Danyon suddenly lifted her up and sat her gently on the counter.</p><p>He looked into her eyes, looked into her\u2014and she was lost.</p><p>Neither said a word.</p><p>None were needed.</p> <p>Nothing spoke louder than this.</p><p>Danyon kissed her long and deep, then lowered his mouth to her breast. Shauna cried out, dug her fingers into his shoulders and pulled him closer. She felt frantic, alive, the need inside her mounting to the point of desperation. His hands moved deftly, slipping the bathrobe off her shoulders, then cupping both her breasts. Her nipples strained against his palms, and he moaned, lifted his head, kissed her lips, her neck.</p><p>Shauna gasped, wrapped her hands behind his head, tangled her fingers in his hair. Part of her wanted to push away, to stay in control. But the other part of her, the one wrapped in his arms and melting under his touch, refused to listen.</p><p>He stepped into her, parting her legs with his body. She opened her mouth to protest, to moan, and his tongue was inside her mouth, teasing, plunging. His hands slipped between her legs, and his thumb began to stroke her, circling the small mound that turned her body into liquid fire. She arched her back, and he groaned, breathed her name, then his fingers pressed into her hot wetness. Her breath came short and fast. She moved in rhythm with his fingers.</p><p>The heat she\u2019d felt emanating from him only moments ago, now felt like a furnace at full power. Combined with the heat from her own desire, she felt as if she were burning from the inside out.</p><p>Then with one sure thrust of his fingers and swirl of his thumb, the orgasm that had been coiling inside her, taut, tight, like an over-wound spring, suddenly let go, and Shauna cried out from the force of it. She felt herself contract around his fingers, her wetness drenching them. He groaned her name, and she let out a guttural moan, sounds she\u2019d never heard herself make before. Danyon growled with desire, and before Shauna knew it, he scooped her into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen.</p> <p>As he walked, he kissed her lips, her eyes, her forehead. She wrapped her arms around his neck, clung to him. The only space and time and matter that existed were right here, right now, and him. She no longer had any desire to maintain control. In fact, she wanted to lose what little she had left. Lose it to him, fall into him with complete abandon.</p><p>Within minutes, Danyon was lowering her down on a royal blue comforter atop a huge four-poster bed. She sank into it, her mind and body still wrapped in heat and desire. His lips never left her as he removed his shirt. Then he stood and stripped off his pants.</p><p>He was huge, the length of him fully engorged. His abdomen was taut and cut, the muscles in his chest, his arms, and his thighs massive and highly defined. Shauna saw them ripple, noticed that his eyes had gone from honey-colored to intense brown. Something told her he was riding the edge of transformation. Instead of frightening her, it excited her all the more. It caused the heat and need inside her to explode into a roaring inferno.</p><p>He leaned over her, placing a hand on either side of her shoulders. He pushed her thighs apart with one knee.</p><p>His eyes never left hers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His voice sounded nothing like Danyon. It was raw, almost feral\u2014and it rang familiar to her ear.</p><p>The length of him brushed up against her sex, teased her swollen mound, stroked the cleft of her. She strained toward him, arching her back. \u201cYes, yesss.\u201d Then her words were replaced by sounds animalistic in nature, mirroring the power and fierceness of the need inside her. The need to control returned once more, only this time she wanted to control his movements, to grab him, force him deeper inside her.</p> <p>He inched forward rubbing against her, steel against satin. The ridge of him entered her, drove her mad, to the point of incomprehension.</p><p>She moaned, urging him inside her, digging her fingernails into his shoulders, raking them across his back.</p><p>She felt the muscles beneath her hands undulate all the more.</p><p>\u201cYesss,\u201d she growled.</p><p>And he thrust forward, plunging the length of him into her swollen well of heat. She cried out, pulled him in closer, bit into his shoulder. He thrust deeper, harder, in\u2014out\u2014in. She was filled to overflowing, consumed with the pleasure of the hugeness inside her, the weight of him on top of her.</p><p>This time her orgasm felt like a tsunami, and she screamed with its release. She heard him growl, then he plunged into her again, and his body became one undulating mass of taut muscle. She heard his howl of release, and her mind settled into a gentle, swirling fog.</p><p>The next thing she knew, Danyon was stretched out beside her, and she lay in the crook of his arm, naked flesh to naked flesh. He smoothed her hair with a hand and whispered her name.</p><p>Then he drew her in even closer and it felt like home.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>It was seven the next morning before Shauna reached home. Danyon hadn\u2019t wanted her to go, but she\u2019d already begged off half a day\u2019s work the day before and didn\u2019t want to leave her sisters in a bind, especially with them bringing in a new load of inventory. If given her druthers, though, she would still be with Danyon, snuggled against him under a thick, down comforter. She\u2019d be there now, tonight, tomorrow...</p><p>Shauna smiled to herself, remembering how Danyon had teased her this morning after she\u2019d discovered her clothes on a small table in the hall near the bathroom. They had been cleaned, folded, and neatly stacked. Even her sneakers looked like new. She\u2019d asked Danyon how they had gotten there, and when he told her that Raul had taken care of her clothes as he had asked him to, she\u2019d hid under the comforter, embarrassed. What time had Raul dropped off her clothes? And what had he heard? Last night she\u2019d experienced the best sex she\u2019d ever had in her life, and she knew she\u2019d not exactly been\u2014quiet during that experience.</p><p>First the embarrassment of Raul possibly hearing more than he should have, and now having to face her sisters. She wasn\u2019t one to stay out all night, so she already knew Fiona would bombard her with questions, and Caitlin would probably tease her to no end.</p><p>Shauna sighed, preparing herself for the inevitable. She stood near the gate that led to the main entry of the center building they called home. It was surrounded by a ten-foot brick wall, and the gate opened up to a path that led past a small garden to the front door.</p><p>Inside, the foyer offered two hallways, one to the left, the second to the right. The grand staircase in the middle of those hallways extended to the second floor. From her perspective, the house was basically three large apartments joined together by a common living area. The commons had a huge dining room that also served as a ballroom, and a large kitchen in the center. As for the apartments, Fiona lived in the east wing, Caitlin in the west, and Shauna in the middle. Each had kitchenettes, bathrooms, bedrooms and a sitting area. Sometimes Shauna felt like she had to go through an entire subdivision just to get to her place. There was no sneaking in\u2014ever. Whether she liked it or not, it was time to face the music.</p><p>As she suspected, Fiona and Caitlin were in the main kitchen. Fiona was at the stove scrambling eggs in one skillet, while flipping ham slices in another. Caitlin stood at the island counter slicing kiwi and fresh strawberries. Both looked up when she walked in.</p><p>\u201cWell, well,\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cOur little night bird is back.\u201d Her silver eyes twinkled with mischief.</p><p>\u201cI thought you were sleeping,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you tell by her eyes?\u201d Caitlin said, grinning. \u201cThey\u2019re redder than Dorothy\u2019s ruby slippers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are not,\u201d Shauna said, marching past her. \u201cAny coffee left?\u201d</p><p>Fiona hitched a thumb toward a side counter. \u201cI just filled the carafe.\u201d</p><p>As Shauna poured herself a cup of coffee, she felt her sisters\u2019 eyes boring into her back.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Fiona finally said, \u201cdid you have a fun evening?\u201d</p><p>Caitlin chuckled.</p><p>Shauna took a couple sips of coffee, then turned to them and leaned her back against the counter. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s so funny?\u201d she asked Caitlin.</p><p>Caitlin held up a hand, feigning innocence. \u201cWhat?\u201d The Cheshire cat grin on her face widened.</p><p>\u201cI heard you snicker. I\u2019m just curious as to what\u2019s so funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I don\u2019t snicker,\u201d Caitlin said, then snickered.</p><p>\u201cCome on, spill it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s kind of obvious that you did have fun last night,\u201d Caitlin said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Shauna quickly checked her shirt and jeans.</p><p>Both were unwrinkled and clean; the same as when she had put them on earlier.</p><p>\u201cNot your clothes, silly.\u201d Caitlin laughed. \u201cYour face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCait, stop picking on her,\u201d Fiona said. Her lips twitched as she struggled to hold back a grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my face?\u201d Shauna asked. She turned and leaned over to see her reflection in the toaster. Besides the dark rings under her eyes from too little sleep, she looked the same as she always did. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot on your face, in your face.\u201d</p><p>Shauna blew out an exasperated breath. \u201cThat makes no sense. What the heck are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got the glow bug.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, you two.\u201d Fiona carried a platter of scrambled eggs and pan-seared ham to the kitchen table. \u201cEat up. We need to get to the shop early today. Jagger and Ryder are already over there unloading the merchandise we picked up at Keeno\u2019s yesterday. Everything needs to be priced and shelved.\u201d</p><p>Still grinning, Caitlin carried the bowl of sliced fruit to the table.</p><p>Shauna followed, coffee cup in hand. \u201cOkay, I know I\u2019m going to be sorry for asking this but...what the heck is a glow bug?\u201d</p><p>Fiona pointed to the table. \u201cSit\u2014eat\u2014both of you.</p><p>Caitlin, stop teasing her or we\u2019ll never get through breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I want to know what she means by \u2018glow bug,\u2019\u201d</p><p>Shauna said, taking her place at the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat it means, little sister,\u201d Caitlin said, while spooning fruit onto her plate, \u201cis that...\u201d She paused, took a bite of strawberry and chewed it\u2014slowly.</p><p>Shauna tsked. \u201cAw, c\u2019mon!\u201d</p><p>Caitlin took her time swallowing. \u201cCome on, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinish what you were saying.\u201d</p> <p>Fiona shook her head. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, you two, give it a rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Caitlin rested an elbow on the table and aimed her fork at Shauna. \u201cIt means you found a Mr. Wonderful. You know, a man who finally turned all your lights on, flipped all your switches, banged all your buttons.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, Shauna tsked again and quickly spooned eggs onto her own plate.</p><p>\u201cSo, did you?\u201d Caitlin asked.</p><p>Shauna ignored her.</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about. Ryder definitely turns all my lights on, and there\u2019s no question that Jagger does it for Fiona. You\u2019ve seen her when he\u2019s around. Especially after he spends the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaitlin!\u201d Fiona said, blushing.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>Jagger DeFarge was a vampire and a homicide detective for NOPD\u2019s eighth precinct. He was also Fiona\u2019s fianc\u00e9. Ryder was Caitlin\u2019s groom-to-be. He was a shifter and a bounty hunter and had played a significant part in stopping the walk-ins before they destroyed the city and everyone in it. Shauna liked both men. They were strong, yet kind, good-looking, but not vain. What she liked most about them, though, was that Jagger and Ryder took good care of her sisters, and it was obvious that they truly loved them.</p><p>Caitlin might have been teasing, but she was right about Fiona. Every time Jagger came around, it looked as if someone had turned a thousand-watt bulb on inside her. Whenever he stayed the night, the following morning, Fiona would float into the kitchen either singing, humming, or whistling. A nuclear bomb could have gone off next door, and Fiona would have sworn on everything sacred that all was right with the world. When Caitlin and Ryder spent time together, Caitlin had the same case of happys, but her afterglow had a different attitude than Fiona\u2019s. It was mellower. More, \u201cYeah, I know all isn\u2019t right with the world, but who cares?\u201d</p><p>Still embarrassed about how easily they\u2019d fingered her, Shauna moved eggs around on her plate with a fork. \u201cYou two act like I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend. I\u2019m not a kid anymore you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, we know that,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cBut you have to admit, it has been a while since you\u2019ve...well, since you\u2019ve kept company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while?\u201d Caitlin laughed. \u201cTry like two years.\u201d</p><p>Shauna shot her a look. \u201cIt has not been two years.\u201d</p><p>She quickly turned back to her eggs, suspecting Caitlin was right again. It had been a while. The last guy she dated had been Jay Beranger, a furniture store owner from Metairie. He had been nice enough, well spoken, decent looking, but just like the other guys she\u2019d been with\u2014and there had been painfully few\u2014something was missing. When Jay had tried to push the relationship forward by proclaiming his undying love and proposing, Shauna broke up with him. She knew she would never marry him, so it didn\u2019t make sense to her to keep leading him on, letting him think the possibility of marriage existed.</p><p>By other women\u2019s standards, Shauna figured she\u2019d probably be considered overly picky, and then reminded herself that the \u2018perfect\u2019 man only existed in romance novels. But she\u2019d never looked for perfection. Just someone who got her. A man who knew where every switch inside her was located.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>Stalling, Shauna took another sip of coffee. Then another.</p><p>\u201cYes, who is this Mr. Wonderful?\u201d Caitlin asked, her expression one of an eager sponge.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Danyon Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Fiona said, her eyes brightening with recognition. \u201cI\u2019ve met Danyon a couple times at the council meetings. Very handsome. And if I remember correctly, he\u2019s alpha of the East Bank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he\u2019s a were?\u201d Caitlin asked.</p><p>Shauna frowned. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s wolven, so what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean that in a bad way,\u201d Caitlin said, eyes twinkling. \u201cIt just makes you an official member of the taboo crew, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Caitlin turned to Fiona. \u201cYou know, if we\u2019re not careful, the title Keeper is going to take on a whole new meaning in this city.\u201d</p><p>This time Fiona laughed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, you guys, stop already.\u201d Shauna dropped her fork onto her plate. \u201cWhat am I missing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get mad,\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cI\u2019m only teasing. See, Fiona is the Keeper of the vampires, and Jagger is a vampire. I\u2019m Keeper of the shifters, and Ryder is a shifter. You\u2019re the Keeper of the weres, and this Danyon Stone, alpha wolven of the East Bank, is definitely were. We Keepers are certainly keeping our own, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Shauna shrugged, sipped more coffee. She wasn\u2019t sure how to respond.</p><p>Keeper of the weres? Yep, right here.</p><p>Keeper of Danyon, the man? She doubted any woman had ever kept him and doubted one ever could.</p><p>\u201cA wolven, huh?\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cSister, if those dark circles under your eyes are any indication, Mr. Stone must be packing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaitlin!\u201d Fiona swatted a hand at her. \u201cDon\u2019t be so uncouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, look.\u201d Shauna set her cup down on the table a little too hard, and coffee sloshed over the brim. \u201cY\u2019all want it straight? Last night wasn\u2019t all about staying over at Danyon\u2019s. He\u2019s really great at...you know, that other part\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Caitlin clapped.</p><p>Fiona jabbed her lightly in the side with an elbow.</p><p>\u201cStop. Let her talk.\u201d She turned to Shauna. \u201cGo on, honey.\u201d</p><p>Shauna looked from Fiona to Caitlin. Breakfast had been forgotten. Both stared at her intently, obviously eager to hear what she had to say.</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t all about sleeping with Danyon and...?\u201d Caitlin said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cDid you go dancing?\u201d Fiona prompted. \u201cTo the movies? What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe moved dead bodies,\u201d Shauna said abruptly.</p><p>Fiona\u2019s mouth fell open.</p><p>Caitlin\u2019s fork clattered to her plate. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say dead bodies?\u201d Fiona\u2019s face turned ashen. She set her fork down beside her plate, nice and proper, as if preparing herself and everything around her for the worst.</p><p>\u201cUh...yeah.\u201d</p><p>Fiona and Caitlin glanced at each other, disbelief etched on their faces.</p><p>\u201cWell...go on,\u201d Fiona said hesitantly.</p><p>Shauna told her sisters about Nicole and Simon, about how they had been found, and how she\u2019d held the flash lights while Danyon examined the bodies.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come home and tell us right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t here,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cYou had taken off for Lake Charles, remember? Keeno\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes August know about this?\u201d Caitlin asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course he does. He wanted the bodies moved to his lake house in LaPlace so he could see Nicole and Simon for himself. He wanted them laid out somewhere decent when the families arrived. Not in the back of an SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Danyon call the police?\u201d Fiona asked. \u201cI know how the clans feel about taking care of their own, but two murders? He should have called someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cThe bodies shouldn\u2019t have been moved. Crucial evidence might have been destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said the same thing to Danyon when I first heard about it,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>\u201cHe could have called Jagger,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cHe\u2019s under world. He\u2019d have understood the delicacy of the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more delicate than you think,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cNicole and Simon were still in were-state. Danyon didn\u2019t want to take any chances on someone seeing them that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Fiona suddenly held up both hands and squinted as if she\u2019d just faced the most horrific sight of her life. \u201cYou mean to tell me that two weres were murdered, and you were out in the middle of nowhere with nothing but a flashlight?\u201d</p><p>Caitlin looked at Fiona with a puzzled expression. \u201cYou\u2019re just catching that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just hit me now! Good Lord, Shauna, do you realize how much danger you put yourself in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was with Danyon,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>\u201cSo? Even if Danyon had the strength of ten weres, what good would it have done if the perpetrator turned out to be a gang of thirty or forty? What would you have done? Run away while Danyon fought them all off? You could have been chased down, captured, and killed for heaven\u2019s sake! Danyon should never have allowed you to be there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAllowed? He\u2019s not my father, and I insisted. My God, you\u2019re letting all these wild scenarios get stuck in your head\u2014gangs\u2014captured\u2014it\u2019s a wonder why I\u2019m not kept chained to a bed for safekeeping. Fi, look, I know you worry because you love me and don\u2019t want to see me hurt, but I\u2019m not a baby anymore. Both of you have to remember that I\u2019m a Keeper, too. Keeper of the weres, and I\u2019m responsible for their well-being. If either of you had found out that two from your community had been murdered, would you have just sat back and done nothing? Wouldn\u2019t you have wanted details? Been on the scene so you\u2019d at least know firsthand what you were really dealing with?\u201d</p><p>After a long pause, Caitlin shrugged, then nodded. \u201cNo question, I would\u2019ve been in the middle of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make this any harder than it is,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s right, Fiona. You know you would\u2019ve done the same thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes well nothing,\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cYou\u2019d have been there. Go on, admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right. But that doesn\u2019t mean I have to like what she did. And it doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t worry,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cWe\u2019re all the blood family we have left. I worry about both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cBut I think you toss a little extra my way because I\u2019m the youngest. And that\u2019s not really fair. I do appreciate your love and concern, and I feel the same about the two of you, too, but I\u2019m not a kid anymore. I\u2019m almost twenty-seven.\u201d</p><p>Fiona offered her a smile. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll try to do better.</p> <p>Promise.\u201d</p><p>Caitlin pushed away from the table. \u201cWe need some kind of strategy to tackle these wolven murders, ladies. I think the leaders of the other underworld groups need to know about them and\u2014\u201d A frown suddenly settled over her face. \u201cWait a minute...Shauna; you said Nicole and Simon were found in were-state? Weres always revert to human form when they die. Why didn\u2019t Nicole and Simon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>Although August had told Shauna and Danyon to keep the information about the metaphysical powers inherent to were claws and fangs under wraps, she wasn\u2019t certain if that applied to her sisters. She was pretty sure if Fiona and Caitlin had been in the meeting with August, he would have revealed the details to them, as well.</p><p>Still, to be on the safe side, Shauna said, \u201cAugust has some ideas about that, but he\u2019s not one hundred percent sure. He\u2019s looking into it.\u201d</p><p>Caitlin\u2019s eyes narrowed, an indicator that she thought the answer smelled a little fishy.</p> <p>\u201cRegardless, we have to let the leaders of the other groups know,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cNot just yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Caitlin asked.</p><p>\u201cThe more people who know, the more opportunity there is for word to spread, and that might send the murderer into hiding before we figure out who it is,\u201d Shauna explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do, then? We can\u2019t just wait around for another murder to happen,\u201d Caitlin said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a double-edged sword. I understand what Shauna is saying, yet at the same time, if word leaks out, and the leaders of the other groups weren\u2019t forewarned, we could very well wind up with another showdown. Just like we did with the cemetery murders and the walk-ins. It\u2019s a toss up\u2014tell them, don\u2019t tell them. Either way, we have a huge problem here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cBut I\u2019m asking the two of you to trust me and respect my role as Keeper of the weres. All I want is a little time before we get the others involved.\u201d</p><p>Fiona and Caitlin studied her for some time, and in the silence, Shauna felt a vibration flowing between the three of them. She knew her sisters would respect her space and her place as Keeper. She also knew that they fully understood the severity of the situation. Everyone who knew about the wolven murders so far feared the same thing\u2014the possibility of another great war.</p> <p>Now that Fiona and Caitlin knew about the crimes, Shauna sensed that the expectation bar in her role as Keeper had just risen exponentially. That bar now looked higher than the Himalayas, and Shauna felt about as prepared to take on that height as a climber with two broken arms.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Every time Danyon crossed over to New Orleans\u2019 West Bank, he not only felt like he\u2019d left New Orleans, but that he\u2019d exited the entire state of Louisiana. There was a different feel to the area and the towns that mapped it. Places like Algiers, Gretna, and Harvey. On the East Bank, where the Quarter was located, there was a sense of continuity. Towns such as Kenner and Metairie felt like New Orleans. They were only different parts that made up a whole. Having just driven through Gretna, Danyon didn\u2019t get the sense that it was tied to anything other than itself.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t unusual for an alpha to cross into other territories, but it didn\u2019t happen often. Some alphas didn\u2019t understand the meaning of borders. They were hardwired to believe that whatever ground their feet touched was up for grabs territorially. To limit the number of fights that came with that mindset, August had issued an addendum to the laws that governed the weres. The official postscript stated that in order for an alpha to cross into another alpha\u2019s territory, he had to get August\u2019s permission. He was also required to provide a valid reason for crossing into that territory. Since trouble makers rarely had a valid reason for anything, the number of problems and fights dropped significantly. This was the first time since the new law was implemented that any alpha had been given free reign over all territories.</p><p>Just as Danyon and Shauna were leaving August\u2019s office yesterday, the elder had given him a directive. He was to contact all the alphas in south Louisiana and inform them of the recent murders. Each alpha was then to choose a few of their strongest, most trustworthy weres and have them stand sentinel around the perimeter of their own territory. And they were to stay there until whoever or whatever was responsible for the murders had been captured.</p><p>Danyon had already notified four of the alphas. One in Lake Charles, another in Lafayette, and the two who were responsible for Baton Rouge. The only one left on his list was Kara Matiste, alpha of New Orleans\u2019 West Bank.</p><p>Kara was alpha by default. Not that she wasn\u2019t strong in her own right, but her husband, Carl, had been the true leader of the West Bank for many years. Kara assumed the leadership role when Carl died eleven months ago in a tragic car accident. He had been traveling home from Atlanta, where he had been summoned by the magistrate for questioning regarding the whereabouts of funds that had recently disappeared from the community treasury. Carl had obviously provided satisfactory answers. The magistrate and council would not have released him otherwise. He was only five miles from the Alabama border when an eighteen wheeler loaded with gasoline T-boned him at an intersection. Carl\u2019s vehicle had exploded on impact.</p><p>At the time of an alpha\u2019s death, it\u2019s customary for his mate, always an alpha female, to take responsibility for the pack. She retains that leadership position until her death or until she pairs with another alpha male. If she does choose another alpha, then she is to relinquish the leadership role to him immediately. That particular circumstance was extremely rare, however.</p><p>When an alpha chooses his mate, it\u2019s for life. The bond between them is fierce. Indestructible. Granted, when one mate died, it didn\u2019t mean that the survivor didn\u2019t have sexual relations with other weres. But when he or she did, it was usually to maintain or increase the population of the pack, and that would be the extent of the tryst. Rarely, if ever, would he or she call another were their mate.</p><p>It was possible for a were to mourn for a lifetime. In the beginning, when the death is fresh and the wound deep, it wasn\u2019t unusual for the surviving mate to become incapacitated by grief. That is when the pack is most vulnerable. At first, many members of the pack act like children, rejoicing that no one is watching their every move. But soon, when they realize how big and bad the outside world really is, they grow fearful and sometimes angry because they no longer feel safe. That never appeared to be the case with Kara\u2019s pack.</p><p>Kara had changed significantly since Carl\u2019s death, which was understandable considering how close they had been. Carl had doted on her. Always surprising Kara with jewelry, roses, or whatever he thought she might fancy at any given time. Being vice president of Regent\u2019s Bank, Carl\u2019s income had afforded them the luxury of a three-story colonial in Algiers and matching Corvettes. Now, Kara lived in a two-bedroom apartment and drove an eight-year-old Chevy Malibu.</p><p>Danyon hadn\u2019t had many dealings with Kara since Carl died, but he\u2019d heard that her mourning period was unusually short, and that she ruled with a firm hand, did not tolerate slackers, and was obsessively territorial. He supposed those traits were good for the pack in that they established black-and-white boundaries. But those same traits might prove problematic when it was time for her to take orders from someone else. Danyon couldn\u2019t help but wonder if Kara thought she had to be tougher because she was female and younger than most of the alpha males who led other packs. He wondered if Shauna, being the youngest Keeper, thought the same.</p><p>Danyon exited off the expressway and headed south toward Estelle, a small town that sat at the feet of the Jean Lafitte Wildlife Preserve. As he drove, Danyon found his thoughts awash with Shauna. It was difficult for him to see her as the Keeper of an entire race for the city of New Orleans. She was so young and beautiful. He remembered how she had stood up to him, defiant, wanting to be part of the murder investigation. How she never once faltered in her commitment to that decision, no matter how frustrated or angry he became. She was certainly from MacDonald stock\u2014hard-headed, loyal, fiercely passionate in her beliefs and, of course, stunning.</p><p>All three MacDonald sisters were breathtakingly beautiful, but there was something about Shauna that hooked into his senses and refused to let go. When they had sat across from each other at August\u2019s conference table, it had taken a massive amount of will power not to sit and simply stare at her. Watch her move, talk, blink, breathe. The struggle to control his attraction to her had been as great as his battle to fight off the anger that forced his transformation. As difficult as it had been, however, Danyon thought he\u2019d managed it relatively well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Until last night.</p><p>He had only to take one look at her wrapped in that bathrobe, her freshly scrubbed face, bare feet, long hair, wet and tousled, and something so powerful welled up inside him, he feared he\u2019d transform on the spot. It was more than desire, more than common sexual attraction. She looked like a waterfall to a man dying of thirst. Somehow, he\u2019d still managed to control himself, act as if everything was normal\u2014even though he stirred a pot he could not see\u2014heard only the melodic sound of her voice, her laughter. He\u2019d kept reminding himself that she was human, he was were, and the difference between them was too vast to bridge.</p><p>Not that sex hadn\u2019t tried to shove its way to the fore-front of his mind. There was no question he was sexually attracted to her. Any man in his right mind would be. But Danyon had had more than his fair share of sexual encounters, with most of them beginning and ending the same way. A little spark of chemistry\u2014a tangle of arms and legs\u2014a physical need met, but a soul left empty. Intuitively, he knew that any man lucky enough to be intimate with Shauna MacDonald would be satiated in ways he never thought possible.</p> <p>His intuition had been right.</p><p>Danyon knew he was tempting fate when he\u2019d helped Shauna retrieve the plates from the cabinet shelf. And fate did not disappoint. When he\u2019d leaned over to grab the plates, her scent, a heady mixture of musk and lilacs, nearly shattered his resolve. His undoing, however, had been when she\u2019d turned around, and he first tasted her lips. From that moment on, the rest of the world had ceased to exist.</p><p>He lost count of the number of times they had made love, but it hadn\u2019t taken him long to figure out he was already in way over his head. She had left him feeling filled and emptied at the same time, which was nirvana in its purest form. But the sure sign of his demise had been the ache in his heart, when he\u2019d watched her leave this morning.</p><p>Danyon was still lost in thought when the smell of blood caught his attention. Puzzled, he glanced down at his hands and then up into the rearview mirror to check his face. No blood. He slowed the car and lowered the driver\u2019s side window. The scent of blood slammed into his nostrils. He swerved to the shoulder of the road and hit the brakes. Fortunately, the road he\u2019d been driving on wasn\u2019t heavily traveled. Aside from an old pickup that had passed him some time ago, his car was virtually the only vehicle on the road.</p><p>Following his nose, Danyon inched the car back onto the road, then drove another mile or so before the scent of blood led him to a graveled road on the left. He turned and followed its meandering path to the base of a forest that was part of the Jean Lafitte Wildlife Preserve. The road eventually ended at a small boat launch on a lake.</p> <p>Danyon parked the car and got out to further investigate on foot. The blood trail led him around the short end of the lake, then deeper into the woods. It wasn\u2019t long before he heard voices. The loudest belonged to a female, and he recognized it almost immediately.</p><p>It was Kara Matiste.</p><p>\u201cWhen I tell you to pick it up, that means now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d a male voice cried. \u201cIt makes me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it makes you sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwear to God I tried!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuit your sniveling. What kind of man are you, crying like a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as can\u2019t. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Danyon stepped into a clearing and saw Kara shove one of her weres, who he knew\u2014 Lawrence Castille\u2014so hard, the were stumbled backwards and nearly fell. Standing a short distance away to Kara\u2019s left, was James Darbonne, another were from her pack. Lawrence and James had been two of Carl\u2019s top men. Both stood a little over six feet tall and had average builds. In human years, they would have been closing in on their mid-thirties. Although James and Lawrence were twice Kara\u2019s size and topped her by at least four inches, they cowered away from her like frightened puppies.</p><p>Kara\u2019s long black hair was pulled back and held in place by a gold barrette, and she wore jeans with the pant legs tucked into black cowboy boots. Her short-sleeved blouse was blood-red with white snaps running down the front. She did a double take when she spotted Danyon. Obviously, she\u2019d been so wrapped up in verbally bashing her weres, she hadn\u2019t caught wind of his approach.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked him, sounding a little unnerved.</p><p>Lawrence and James looked away shame-faced.</p><p>\u201cI have news from August,\u201d Danyon said. The smell of blood had grown so thick, he actually tasted it. From between Kara and Lawrence\u2019s legs, he spotted something on the ground behind them. He suspected it was what led him here. He wanted to walk over and see for himself, but out of respect for Kara\u2019s role as alpha and the fact that he was in her territory, he stayed put.</p> <p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Her dark eyes flashed with anger.</p><p>Danyon glared at Kara long and hard, making sure she understood\u2014 If you think you\u2019re big and bad enough to get me to fold at your feet like the other two, you need to think again.</p><p>Evidently getting the message, she broke eye contact first. \u201cHow in the hell did you find me way out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI smelled blood. Followed it here.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips. \u201cWell, you\u2019re just a regular effin\u2019 Sherlock Holmes now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Danyon glanced down at her legs, a signal to let Kara know he\u2019d spotted something behind them. Then he asked, \u201cAnything I can help with?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes became black, cold marbles. \u201cNot unless you can raise the goddamn dead.\u201d With that, she shoved Lawrence back, then turned to one side, giving Danyon a better view.</p><p>A were lay on the ground about ten feet away. He was in full were-state, wrapped in cable, covered in blood, minus claws or fangs\u2014and was most certainly dead. A roll of plastic sheeting lay on the ground beside him. From the looks of it, Kara had probably been trying to get Lawrence and James to move the body onto it.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy in the hell does it matter to you who he is? He\u2019s one of mine.\u201d</p><p>Danyon narrowed his eyes, felt his nostrils flare. \u201cIt matters because he\u2019s were, Kara. One of us.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name is Theodore Price,\u201d James said, taking a tentative step toward them. \u201cBut everybody called him Teddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid anybody ask you?\u201d Kara snapped.</p><p>James bowed his head submissively and retracted his step.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find him?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>After a long pause, Kara sighed, evidently sensing that she wasn\u2019t going to get rid of him that easily. \u201cAbout an hour or two ago. I\u2019m not sure of the exact time. Can\u2019t keep track of every damn thing. Been trying to get the body moved before all hell breaks loose out here. If the rest of my pack sees this, they\u2019re going to panic like a bunch of effin\u2019 coyotes.\u201d</p><p>Danyon nodded. \u201cI know what you mean.\u201d</p><p>She let out a sarcastic snort. \u201cYou don\u2019t know jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know more than you think.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>With an almost imperceptible aim of his chin, he signaled that he didn\u2019t want to discuss the matter in front of James and Lawrence.</p><p>Kara turned to James. \u201cGet your ass to town and take the sniveling fool with you. But I want you back here in thirty minutes, no later. Got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d James said, head down, eyes averted.</p><p>\u201cAnd this time, bring somebody with you who\u2019s got a set of balls. Now get outta here, both of you.\u201d</p><p>In a flash, the two weres darted off, disappearing into the forest on the opposite side of the clearing.</p><p>Once they were out of sight, Danyon turned to her, knowing he would get blasted for the question he was about to ask. \u201cWhy do you treat them that way, Kara?\u201d</p><p>Her face clouded, and her lips tightened into a thin line. She took a step toward him, and he saw the muscles in her forearm begin to ripple. \u201cWhat kind of pussy alpha would ask a question like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing alpha doesn\u2019t mean beating the dignity out of your pack.\u201d</p><p>Kara\u2019s feet widened to a fight stance. \u201cLet me tell you something, Danyon Stone\u2014I don\u2019t know how you lead the marshmallows you call wolven over on the East Bank, but I keep a strong hand on mine. If you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll run all over you, doing and saying whatever they want, whenever they want. I\u2019m alpha of the West Bank, and I make damn sure my pack never forgets it. You\u2019ve got to keep your weres tough, sharp, ready for anything.\u201d She pointed to Teddy. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, crap like this happens.\u201d She turned away, but not before Danyon saw her eyes well up with tears.</p><p>He gave her a moment to compose herself, then said, \u201cI know where you\u2019re coming from because I lost two yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Kara whirled about, mouth agape. \u201cTwo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Same way, too. Cables, claws and fangs torn off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman? Had they turned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Both still in were-state, just like Teddy.\u201d</p><p>Kara brushed a hand briskly over the top of her head. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on here? Have you ever seen anything like that before? A dead wolven still were, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until yesterday.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this much, if some asshole thinks he\u2019s gonna just come out here to the West Bank and pick off my weres, he\u2019s got another thing coming. The sonofabitch better think twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever or whatever does not seem to be targeting any specific pack. Remember, it happened on the East Bank, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cI\u2019ve already seen the other alphas, and, thankfully, nothing\u2019s happened within their packs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugust sent you to warn us about this, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That and he wants all of us to pick out a handful of our strongest weres and post them around the perimeter of our territories. They\u2019re to stay there until the murderer is found.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kara threw her hands up. \u201cI\u2019m busting my ass, trying to keep this quiet, and now I\u2019ve got to stick some of my weres on watch? Just what the hell am I supposed to tell them to watch out for while they\u2019re out there picking their noses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave them keep an eye out for unusual activity. Anyone new or suspicious in the area.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled a loud breath of frustration. \u201cCan I get any more vague? They\u2019ll look at me like I\u2019ve lost it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell them whatever you have to,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cWith as tight a reign as you have over your pack, I\u2019m sure all you\u2019ll have to do is tell the weres you choose to stay put, and they\u2019d stay put. They don\u2019t have to have a reason.\u201d</p><p>Kara sucked on the back of her front teeth and nodded. \u201cTrue. Good point. Very good point.\u201d Still nodding, she glanced over at Teddy. \u201cYou see that? If you had only listened to me. If you hadn\u2019t been so damn weak. How many times did I tell you that you had to toughen up?\u201d</p><p>Danyon felt awkward, as if he was eavesdropping on a private conversation. \u201cWant some help moving him?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNah, I got it.\u201d Shoving her hands into the back pockets of her jeans, she stared up at Danyon and offered nothing more.</p><p>After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, Danyon finally said, \u201cSo I can tell August you\u2019ll be setting weres at post?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll set \u2019em up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m sure August will summon everyone together in a couple of days, so we can compare notes. Unless something comes up before then, of course. If you notice anything unusual, no matter how slight, give me a call, would you?\u201d</p><p>Kara arched her brow.</p><p>\u201cAll right, so don\u2019t call me. At least call August. He\u2019ll send reinforcements.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need backup,\u201d Kara said. \u201cIf anything, or anyone, is brave enough to come out my way, my best weres will definitely mark it\u2014or him. Trust me, if I have to call August, it\u2019ll be for him to send over a grunt to pick up a body.\u201d With that, she turned away and walked over to Teddy.</p><p>Taking that as his exit cue, Danyon left Kara alone with her dead were and headed back to his car, following the trail he had created on his way to the clearing.</p> <p>Mission accomplished. All of the alphas in south Louisiana had been alerted, and in short order. He should have felt some sense of satisfaction about that. Instead, he felt uneasy. Kara\u2019s obvious anger issues, combined with her my-way-or-the-highway attitude, was a recipe for disaster.</p><p>She was an explosion waiting to happen.</p><p>And that was the last thing any of them needed.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Fiona\u2019s idea for the three of them to take some time off yesterday in preparation for the Nuit du Dommage tourist rush had been spot on. So had been her suggestion to pick up additional inventory from Keeno\u2019s. Without those extra supplies, most of the shelves in the shop would have been empty hours ago.</p><p>It was mid-afternoon, and Shauna had managed to steal only one bathroom break since they\u2019d opened that morning. So many customers were wandering in and out of the shop, that Caitlin eventually shoved a plastic wedge beneath the front door to keep it open and stop the trio of small bells that hung over the threshold from ringing every other second. Her feet and head throbbed; even her face ached from forcing a smile every time someone came to the register. She needed food, another trip to the bathroom, and sleep. If she had gotten an hour of sleep at Danyon\u2019s, it had been a lot.</p><p>She was still standing behind the register, ringing up a large number of items for an elderly man, when a black-haired woman wearing too much perfume and a skintight blouse with a neckline that plunged down to her navel, shoved a bag in Shauna\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s these for?\u201d the woman asked.</p> <p>Shauna held up a finger, signaling the woman to wait, then finished keying in the last series of numbers from a product code.</p><p>With that done, Shauna looked over at the woman, forced smile in place. \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to help you as soon as I\u2019m finished with this gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, c\u2019mon. All I want to know is what they\u2019re for. Look, he don\u2019t mind if you help me. You don\u2019t mind, do you, mister? You don\u2019t care if I get a couple questions answered, huh?\u201d She smiled at him, rested an elbow on the counter and leaned forward, giving him a close up of her cleavage. To Shauna\u2019s surprise, and the woman\u2019s shock, the man completely ignored her.</p><p>Good for you, Shauna thought.</p><p>Refusing to be deterred, the woman leaned over the counter and shook the bag under Shauna\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cPuhlease? I just want to know what this is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you\u2014in a minute,\u201d Shauna said, keeping her eyes on the elderly man\u2019s purchases. She despised bullies and people who whined and threw tantrums until they got what they wanted.</p><p>\u201cI thought y\u2019all were supposed to help people,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI\u2019m staying with a friend at the Bienville House, and he told me to come over here because he\u2019s feeling poorly and said y\u2019all had natural stuff that would make him feel better. He told me to get some kind of shriveled up berry thing...seesaw or sawmill or something stupid like that. I can\u2019t remember what the name of it is, but if I heard it, I\u2019d probably remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaw palmetto berries,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The woman pulled the bag back with a snap, a huge smile on her face.</p><p>Shauna was about to total the man\u2019s order, when the woman shoved the bag under her nose again.</p><p>\u201cSo what are they good for?\u201d</p><p>Shauna glanced up at the man apologetically, then said to the black-haired nuisance, \u201cThey\u2019re used for colds, hay-fever, bronchitis, mainly upper respiratory problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d The woman snapped the bag back again.</p><p>Not two seconds later, the bag was in Shauna\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cSo what you got to do with \u2019em? Eat \u2019em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, please. Just give me a minute to finish helping this man, and I\u2019ll answer all of your questions,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>\u201cAll I wanna know is what I\u2019ve gotta do\u2014\u201d</p><p>A large hand appeared out of nowhere, grabbed the woman\u2019s arm and yanked it down so the bag was no longer in Shauna\u2019s face. Lurnelle Franklin had arrived to save the day, and she had come in style. She wore a plum-colored, V-neck pullover that reached her mid-thigh, tight black pants, and gold, strappy sandals.</p><p>\u201cYou got a problem with you ears, Miss Thing?\u201d Lurnell snapped. \u201cThe lady here said to hol\u2019 up, and she even asked you nice.\u201d</p><p>Shauna smiled a thank-you to Lurnell and finished bagging the gentleman\u2019s merchandise. The black-haired woman with the bag of palmetto berries took a couple of steps back to put some distance between herself and Lurnell. \u201cWell, I never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right you never, and you never gonna neither with them titties hangin\u2019 out like that,\u201d Lurnell said. \u201cGo cover that up, girl. Ain\u2019t nobody tryin\u2019 to see them old nasty things anyhow.\u201d</p><p>The man Shauna had been waiting on, the one who had refused to be swayed by the display of cleavage earlier, burst out laughing.</p><p>Obviously shamed, the black-haired woman threw the bag on the counter, spun around on her heels and stormed out of the store.</p><p>Shauna handed the man his bag of goods. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be,\u201d he said between chuckles. \u201cIt\u2019s the best laugh I\u2019ve had all year. I like this place. I do believe I\u2019ll come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou a smart man,\u201d Lurnell said. She gave him a big grin.</p><p>No sooner did he leave the store than Fiona came out of the reading room, where she had been reading tea leaves for an Asian woman, and walked over to the counter.</p><p>\u201cI thought I recognized that voice.\u201d Fiona smiled at Lurnell. \u201cHow are you doing, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m all good,\u201d Lurnell said.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d Fiona turned to Shauna. \u201cAnd what about you? It sounded like things were getting a little carried away out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all cool,\u201d Lurnell reassured her. \u201cSome old, nasty hussy was shovin\u2019 stuff in my girl\u2019s face here, so I put a little play on her. I be figurin\u2019 that the hussy\u2019s gots to go, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? You feelin\u2019 me?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI swear, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong wit\u2019 all the people in the world today. They crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cI appreciate you stepping in the way you did. That woman would probably still be waving that bag in my face if it hadn\u2019t been for you.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell tsked and flapped a hand at her. \u201cAw, ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but a thing, girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think every good heroine deserves a reward,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cI\u2019ve got fresh baked chocolate cookies back in the office. Think you can handle a few?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few? Sheee, I can handle a lotta few.\u201d Lurnell slapped a hand to her belly.</p><p>\u201cYou bring \u2019em, and Lurnell\u2019s gonna eat \u2019em. I love chocolate!\u201d</p><p>Fiona laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it. I have to help Caitlin with something first, but as soon as I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll get those cookies for you. It shouldn\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere,\u201d Lurnell said, bright-eyed.</p><p>As Fiona headed for Caitlin, four girls who appeared to be in their early teens, came rushing up to the cash register, giggling.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>More giggling. Whispering. Then each girl stretched out a hand. One held a piece of citrine, another hematite, the third, a piece of amethyst, and the fourth, a beautifully cut quartz.</p><p>\u201cAre these, like, magical?\u201d the girl holding the citrine asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said the one with the amethyst. \u201c\u2019Cause, like, we have a friend, you know, who told us they were real magic. And, like, we were supposed to come over here and get some, and you\u2019d be able to tell us, like, which ones might bring us boyfriends and stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All four girls started giggling again.</p><p>Shauna grinned. She didn\u2019t want to burst their bubble by getting technical, but the truth of the matter was that the magical elements in crystals and gems didn\u2019t have anything to do with magic at all. The vibration of each stone, united with the energy of focused thought, often times did manifest a person\u2019s goal or desire. But that had nothing to do with magic. It was simply the natural law of attraction. She was trying to figure out how to explain that without getting too technical, when Lurnell stepped up to the girls.</p><p>\u201cOkay, if y\u2019all wanna know if them rocks is magic, put \u2019em right here in my hand,\u201d Lurnell said. \u201cI\u2019m gonn\u2019 feel if they magic, and if they is, I\u2019m gonna tell you they is. If they not, I\u2019m gonna tell you they not.\u201d</p> <p>Looking a little fearful, each girl dropped her stone into Lurnell\u2019s palm.</p><p>\u201cNow, let\u2019s see what we got in here.\u201d Lurnell sandwiched the stones between her hands, closed her eyes, then cocked her head like she was listening to something far away. \u201cUh-huh, I be hearin\u2019 somethin\u2019... Oh, yeah, I be feelin\u2019 you now.\u201d She frowned, squeezed her eyes shut tighter. \u201cHuh? Whatchu said? Oh...okay.\u201d With that, she opened her eyes, held out the stones and declared, \u201cThey big magic for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d one of the girls said.</p><p>Lurnell plopped a hand on her hip. \u201cWhat? If I told you they magic, they magic. Now, that\u2019s all I\u2019m sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d another girl said breathlessly.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s so cool,\u201d a third girl chimed in.</p><p>The girl with the amethyst raised a hand as if she were in a classroom.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh, don\u2019t be wavin\u2019 no hand at me,\u201d Lurnell said. \u201cI ain\u2019t got nothin\u2019 more to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how do we make the magic stones work?\u201d Amethyst asked.</p><p>Lurnell harrumphed. \u201cAll I got to say is they big\u2014big magic. The res\u2019 is all you.\u201d</p><p>The girls nodded in unison and couldn\u2019t pay for their stones fast enough. Shauna fought with her conscience as she rang them up. She didn\u2019t want the girls to leave the shop thinking they had real magical stones, but she didn\u2019t want to risk saying anything and embarrassing Lurnell. Besides, the girls did look extremely happy.</p> <p>As the girls left, whispering and giggling en masse, Shauna turned to Lurnell. \u201cWhy did you tell them that?\u201d she asked, unable to hide a grin. \u201cNow those kids are going to go home thinking they have real magic stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there be somethin\u2019 wrong wit\u2019 that?\u201d Lurnell shook her head. \u201cGirl, don\u2019t you start climbin\u2019 on no high horse, you hear me? You gots to learn how to work you stuff in the shop if you wanna make that green. Them kids is gonna go home all excited, and they\u2019s gonna tell they friends, and them friends gonna tell some more friends, and all them friends gonna come up in here to get some rocks. You call that\u2014takin\u2019 care of bidness.\u201d</p><p>Shauna laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re a trip, you know that? Hey, talking about business, why aren\u2019t you at Sistah\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Lurnell\u2019s face lit up. \u201c\u2019Cause I had to come show my girl somethin\u2019. Look here.\u201d She held out her right hand, pinky side up. \u201cGo \u2019head, check it.\u201d</p><p>Shauna rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little soon to be trying this again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be talkin\u2019 like that. Just look when I tell you look.\u201d</p><p>To appease her, Shauna took Lurnell\u2019s hand and examined it. \u201cWhat the...?\u201d There, just above the thin, pink scar that had come from Lurnell\u2019s handy work, was the real deal\u2014a marriage line. It was faint, but unquestionably there. Shauna peered up at her. \u201cIt\u2019s real,\u201d she said, amazed.</p><p>\u201cI knowed it!\u201d Lurnell pulled her hand back and clapped. \u201cI seen it when I was brushin\u2019 my teeth and hair this mornin\u2019, and I says to myself, \u2018Lurnell Shantelle Marquetha Franklin, you gonna get married, girl!\u2019 Then I says, \u2018You got to go show her\u2014that be you\u2014\u2019cause she ain\u2019t gonna believe it\u2019s for real. I swear to gawd, girl, I be so excited, I had to back myself up to the commode before I peed myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet! I\u2019ve never known one to appear that fast. Not in one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I know why it come fas\u2019,\u201d Lurnell said. Her eyes danced with a secret she couldn\u2019t wait to share.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I met me a man las\u2019 night. His name be Tyree Johnson, and, oh, that man look good. He all the time be sweet talkin\u2019 and even got hisself a real job. And he ain\u2019t got no baby mamas nowheres, so he ain\u2019t gotta pay that child support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you meet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown to Zydeco Joe\u2019s, and let me tell you what, child, that man can for sure bus\u2019 a step!\u201d</p><p>Lurnell was demonstrating a few zydeco moves, when Fiona appeared with a plate of chocolate cookies.</p><p>\u201cHere you go, just like I promised,\u201d Fiona said, and handed the plate to Lurnell. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d She gave Lurnell a little four-finger wave, then headed for a group of customers standing near the amulet and totem display.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah!\u201d Lurnell held the plate close as though someone might steal it at any moment. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have a few of these here, then I got to get back to the store.</p><p>Bidness be good and all, but they got all kinda people walk-in\u2019 up in my stuff wit\u2019 they dirty shoes. I gots to go pass the vacuum, so the place look good. Tyree comin\u2019 later. He gonna be\u2014\u201d</p><p>A blast of rap music suddenly erupted, and it sounded like it was coming from Lurnell\u2019s rear end.</p><p>\u201cHol\u2019 up,\u201d she said, and dipped a hand behind her back. It returned clutching a cell phone. She checked the caller I.D. and broke into a wide grin. \u201cThat be Tyree.\u201d She handed Shauna the plate of cookies. \u201cNow don\u2019t be goin\u2019 nowheres wit\u2019 that. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell flipped the phone open and put it to her ear. \u201cHey, Tyree, baby, where y\u2019at?\u201d As she listened to his response, she winked at Shauna, then stepped away from the counter, evidently wanting some privacy.</p><p>Watching Lurnell coo into the phone, reminded Shauna of Nicole and Ian. How each time they had come into the shop for tea and scones, Nicole had had that same over-the-top happy look on her face. Just like Lurnell did now. Thinking about Nicole made Shauna wonder about the keening sound she had heard in the shop the day before. Had it been Nicole crying out before she died or Ian in mourning? Not that it really mattered. Dead was dead, and heart-pain was heart-pain. Both carried pitiful sounds.</p><p>Thoughts of the two weres brought Danyon to mind, and Shauna suddenly realized she had yet to hear from him today. She figured he had been too busy, alerting the other alphas, as August had requested, and busy she certainly understood. Still, it would have been nice if he had taken the time to call her at the shop, for no other reason but to hear her voice.</p><p>She would give anything to hear his right now. To feel his touch. Last night had been one of the most amazing nights of her life. Shauna still couldn\u2019t get over how quickly she had reacted to his touch. She had never felt anything so\u2014right before. To call it electricity or a connection, didn\u2019t even come close to describing what had flowed between them. It had felt as though each had reached into the other and took hold of their soul, absorbing not only all they were now, but all they were ever meant to be.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me. Can you help me with this?\u201d a woman asked, and thrust a matrix box at Shauna. \u201cHow does it open?\u201d</p><p>Shaken out of her reverie, Shauna took the box and began to work it open. She felt a bit guilty. In the short respite she\u2019d had between customers, she had let her mind float away on thoughts of Danyon instead of focusing on Nicole and Simon, and how they might go about finding the murderer. It wasn\u2019t going to be an easy task. They had found no blaring evidence that pointed them in any specific direction. So far, all they had was speculation\u2014a human couldn\u2019t have done it\u2014a shifter, possible, but not likely\u2014a group of glamouring vampires held some possibilities, but weak ones. For all they knew, those assumptions could be wrong. Maybe a vampire or a shifter or even a were was exactly what they should be looking for. She just wished they had more to work with. Anything that might tighten their aim. In some respects she understood why Danyon wanted to hold things close to the vest for now, and why he didn\u2019t want to inform the leaders of the other subcultures yet. On the other hand, she saw the benefits that could come from joining forces just as clearly.</p><p>\u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t do something about that kid, I\u2019m going to hog-tie him and toss him out of the store myself,\u201d Caitlin said storming up to the register.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Shauna asked</p><p>The answer came running down the center aisle of the store, arms flapping wildly, like a hummingbird on speed.</p><p>It was Banjo Marks.</p><p>Some customers yelped and jumped out of his way. Others hurried out of the store, as if the building had suddenly caught fire.</p><p>\u201cI smell \u2019em, smell \u2019em!\u201d Banjo shouted, then slid toward the counter. His knees smacked into the counter wall\u2014hard. He didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cLemme have some, girly girl. Now, okay? Where\u2019s at? I smell \u2019em, smell \u2019em!\u201d</p><p>He was chattering at a hundred miles an hour, and the customers still in the store backed away, giving him a wide berth.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d Caitlin fumed. \u201cHe\u2019s scaring our customers off!\u201d</p><p>Shauna scanned the store for her muscle, but Lurnell was nowhere to be seen. She\u2019d evidently stepped out to have a private conversation with her new man. He must have truly been a gem for Lurnell to leave an entire plate of cookies behind. The plate still sat near the end of the counter, where Shauna had placed it a few minutes ago\u2014and where Banjo was headed now.</p><p>\u201cI knew it\u2014smelt it\u2014knew it! Smelt \u2019em all the way across the street,\u201d Banjo declared, then let out a loud, twittering laugh that made Shauna want to slap her hands over her ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More customers scrambled out of the store.</p><p>Banjo was about to dive into the plate of cookies with both hands, when Fiona suddenly appeared and grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>\u201cCome on, sweetie. Let\u2019s go into the office, and I\u2019ll make you a sandwich.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Banjo yelled. \u201cCookies, cookies. Gotta have \u2019em, want to have \u2019em. Cookies!\u201d He wiggled, trying to pull out of Fiona\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Caitlin slapped a hand to her forehead. \u201cFi, you\u2019ve got to quit encouraging him like that. You keep feeding him, and he keeps coming back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing back, coming back!\u201d Banjo mimicked, sounding like a hoarse parrot.</p><p>\u201cYou two go see about the customers,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat customers?\u201d Caitlin said, frowning. \u201cHe\u2019s run nearly everybody off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen see to the ones who are left,\u201d Fiona said sternly. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of Banjo. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot okay\u2014it\u2019s not okay!\u201d Banjo squawked. \u201cNo sandwich! I want a cookie. Cookie!\u201d</p><p>Shauna picked up the plate of cookies, thinking out of sight, out of mind. The moment she turned away with the plate, Banjo let out a loud shriek.</p><p>\u201cNo, feed it! It\u2019s all good\u2014it\u2019s good!\u201d\u2014hehehehehe, squawk-scritch-squawk.</p><p>There it was again. That nerve-grating, hair-raising laugh. It made Shauna\u2019s teeth hurt.</p> <p>Banjo plucked his arm from Fiona\u2019s grasp and started hopping in place. Then he worked his way around Fiona, bouncing from left to right, so she couldn\u2019t get hold of him.</p><p>Still bouncing, he made his way to Shauna. \u201cGimme cookie, give you secret.\u201d An ugly grin spread over his face. \u201cCookie\u2014secret, secret\u2014cookie.\u201d</p><p>Shauna wanted to punch his high wattage lights out. \u201cStop bouncing like that. You\u2019re making me dizzy.\u201d</p><p>That twittering laugh again.</p><p>\u201cLook, just go with Fiona, Banjo,\u201d Shauna ordered, hoping that food would calm him down at least a little.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Got a secret. Gooood secret! One cookie, good secret. Two cookie, more secret!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? What secret?\u201d</p><p>Banjo lifted his head, sniffed three or four times.</p> <p>\u201cSixteen cookies. Got sixteen cookies on the plate. Sixteen!\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, Shauna glanced down at the plate in her hand, did a quick count, and was astonished to find it held exactly sixteen cookies. \u201cHow did you know how many there were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmell it. Can\u2019t you smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, you,\u201d Fiona said, finally latching on to Banjo\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cNo, not come on!\u201d He leaned way over to the left, closer to Shauna. \u201cGive me a cookie, tell you a secret!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo eat a sandwich or something, Banjo. You\u2019re talking out of your head.\u201d</p><p>He stopped bouncing and squinted at Shauna, as though sizing her up. Then he opened his eyes wide. \u201cGot no teeth. Ain\u2019t got no more teeth\u2014no more big fingernails. Nope, none!\u201d</p><p>Shauna froze. \u201cWhat\u2014who has no teeth or fingernails, Banjo?\u201d</p><p>Hehehehe, squawk-scritch-squawk\u2014\u201cNo teeth, gotta have teeth! Gotta.\u201d He hooked a finger on either side of his upper lip and pulled it up over his teeth. Then he tapped a dirty fingernail against a tobacco stained incisor. \u201cGotta have the teeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea what he\u2019s talking about?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Shauna said, then set the plate on the counter out of Banjo\u2019s reach and took a cookie from the top of the heap. \u201cBut we\u2019ll soon find out.\u201d She dangled the chocolate chip cookie in front of him.</p><p>With a loud grunt, Banjo grabbed the cookie and stuffed all of it into his mouth in one fell swoop. He closed his eyes, a blissful expression on his face. When he opened his eyes again, he started hopping on one foot then the other.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I gave you a cookie, now what\u2019s the secret?\u201d</p><p>Hehehehe, squawk...</p><p>Banjo broke free of Fiona again and took off running through the store. Fiona and Caitlin ran after him, but before either could corner him at the back of the stop, he\u2019d spun around and was halfway back up the center aisle, heading toward Shauna.</p><p>The counter caught him at the waist this time, and for a moment, Shauna thought he would flip clean over to the other side.</p><p>\u201cOne more dead,\u201d he hissed, glaring at her, fidgeting in place. \u201cOne, two\u2014three. Three dead, no teeth. No big fingernails. Three dead, three dead!\u201d</p><p>With her heart thudding in her ears, Shauna grabbed the back of his shirt and held tight. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? Who\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Banjo suddenly stopped fidgeting and pulled away from her. \u201cThree blind mice,\u201d he said, his voice low, robotic. \u201cSee how they run. Run with no teeth. So stupid. Three, stupid, blind\u2014dead mice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Banjo,\u201d Shauna said, keeping her voice low. \u201cTell me who you\u2019re talking about. Who\u2019s dead?\u201d</p><p>Without warning, he sparked back to life. \u201cCookie, cookie!\u201d he yelled, then shrieked with laughter and ran out of the store.</p><p>Shauna\u2019s heart was beating so hard it made her nauseous. Banjo knew about the weres. She was sure of it. But he said there were three.</p><p>Nicole, Simon...who else?</p><p>Had another were been killed?</p><p>And the teeth. How did Banjo know about the teeth and claws?</p><p>Shauna felt an uneasiness rising in her gut. An intuitive whisper. And she remembered Banjo and Mattie fighting in front of the store\u2014how Mattie had dented the light pole with her fist.</p><p>Too much strength for such a small woman...</p><p>And Banjo, who claimed to have smelled the cookies from across the street. With so many tourists clogging the streets, that would have been...should have been...impossible.</p><p>August had said that whomever ingested the claws and fangs of a were would take on the traits of a were. Everything but transformation.</p><p>Had Banjo and Mattie ingested either? Both?</p><p>Fear crept up Shauna\u2019s spin.</p><p>Three down\u2014no more to go.</p><p>It was time to get Jagger and Ryder involved\u2014time to bring in the leaders of the other races\u2014time to enlist reinforcements.</p><p>Whether Danyon liked it or not.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>A Little Bit of Magic was so packed with customers that Danyon had to literally squeeze into the shop sideways. Any other time, and he would have backtracked out of there, refusing to be part of the throng. He hated crowds. The collective energy of too many people in a limited space scrambled his thoughts and made him anxious.</p><p>There was only one reason he allowed this exception. Shauna. He had to talk to her.</p><p>As soon as the West Bank was a dot in his rearview mirror, Danyon had hurried back to the Quarter to find her. That in and of itself had made him feel strange. He had never hurried back to anyone for anything before.</p><p>Since their time together last night, Shauna had burrowed into his core, and there was no getting rid of her. He wouldn\u2019t have wanted to if he could. His intellect kept telling him that the intimacy they shared had been a mistake. A human and a wolven didn\u2019t belong together. Their worlds were too different. It would never work.</p><p>His emotions countered, however, telling his brain it was full of crap. He needed to enjoy and treasure the remarkable gift that she was.</p><p>Danyon couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had felt this alive. And, if the truth be told, it had little to do with the sex they\u2019d had\u2014although to him it scored a thousand on a scale of one to ten. Danyon had had more than his fair share of intimacy with other women, but not once had he left their beds with a total sense of contentment.</p><p>Shauna had been different. Being with her had caused a floodgate to open inside him.</p><p>The contentment he had felt had been absolute, filling him, yet emptying him at the same time.</p><p>Danyon not only wanted to share her bed, he wanted to share her heart and share his with her. He had never felt more emotionally raw, vulnerable or befuddled in his life.</p><p>Shauna was the Keeper of the weres, so she had a right to know about the death of Kara\u2019s were. That\u2019s what he kept telling himself. But it was only half the truth and mostly an excuse. He simply wanted, needed to see her again.</p><p>Danyon moved slowly through the crowd, making his way to the front counter. If Shauna wasn\u2019t there, working the register, he knew one of her sisters would be. And they\u2019d know where to find her.</p><p>When he finally made it to the register, he saw Caitlin pounding away at the keys. A long line of customers waited their turn. He stood off to one side, waiting for a break in the action so he could talk to her. Caitlin must have sensed him watching her because she glanced over and gave him a hesitant smile.</p><p>A moment later, she peered over at him again. But the fifth or sixth time she looked his way, her brow was deeply furrowed. Either curiosity was getting to her or she was worried that she might have a stalker on her hands.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before she gave in and turned to face Danyon. \u201cMay I help you?\u201d A middle-aged man, who had been next in line, let out an exasperated sigh.</p><p>Evidently hearing the customer\u2019s distress, Caitlin quickly turned back to the man and offered her apologies. \u201cThanks so much for your patience. I\u2019ll only be a couple more seconds.\u201d</p><p>With that, Caitlin faced Danyon again. \u201cIs there a reason you\u2019re just standing there staring? Do I know you from somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met before. My name\u2019s Danyon Stone. I\u2019m looking for Shauna.\u201d There were too many people around for him to identify himself as the alpha of the East Bank pack.</p><p>Caitlin\u2019s frown deepened. \u201cWhat do you want with my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a friend of hers,\u201d he offered.</p><p>At first, his answer seemed to puzzle Caitlin all the more, then a twinkle lit up her eyes and she smiled.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the infamous Mr. Stone,\u201d she said.</p><p>Wondering what Shauna might have told her sisters about him, Danyon cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, yes.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIs Shauna here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Caitlin chewed her bottom lip, as though trying to decide if she should divulge any information. Finally she said, \u201cShauna\u2019s in the reading room. Take a left after the row of curios, then head straight back. You\u2019ll see a heavy blue curtain. Push past it, and you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reading room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...oh, sorry. I figured you already knew. I read Tarot cards, our oldest sister, Fiona, reads tea leaves, and Shauna palms. We do all of our readings back there.\u201d</p> <p>Taking in that nugget of information, Danyon thanked Caitlin for her help and headed for the room with the heavy blue curtain. He wondered if Shauna had read his palm without him knowing it. He didn\u2019t know whether to smile or cringe at the thought.</p><p>As soon as Danyon laid a hand on the curtain\u2019s edge, ready to pull it aside, he heard voices in the room beyond it. It sounded like two men\u2014another woman.</p><p>Shauna wasn\u2019t alone.</p><p>He hesitated. Ordinarily he would have knocked, so as not to seem intrusive, but there was no door.</p><p>Caitlin directed you here. If she\u2019d thought you\u2019d be interrupting on a private matter, she wouldn\u2019t have...</p> <p>With that thought in mind, Danyon pushed the curtain aside and stepped across the threshold of the room. Their conversation stopped abruptly when they spotted him a few seconds later, but he heard scraps of their conversation in the meantime. He felt his heart drop to his feet.</p><p>The room wasn\u2019t very big, maybe ten by twelve and sparsely furnished. Shauna was indeed inside. So was her older sister, Fiona, Jagger DeFarge, the vampire homicide detective and another man, tall, square-faced, someone Danyon didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>The collection of people wasn\u2019t what made Danyon\u2019s heart drop. It was their topic of discussion\u2014his dead weres. He had gone on blind faith that Shauna would honor his request to keep the information about Nicole and Simon quiet for twelve hours. And if he went strictly by the clock, she had fulfilled that request. But after the intimate time they had spent together last night, he had stupidly assumed she would extend that vow of silence until they at least had a chance to discuss the matter again.</p><p>He felt betrayed, even though he knew he had no right to the emotion.</p><p>Shauna had fulfilled her obligation.</p><p>She owed him no more.</p> <p>His disappointment must have shown because the tentative smile Shauna gave him when she spotted him in the room suddenly collapsed to a frown.</p><p>\u201cDanyon, how good to see you again,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>He gave a small nod. \u201cGood to see you, too, Fiona.\u201d He had only met Fiona twice before, and the last time had been over a year ago. He was surprised she remembered him. \u201cSorry for the interruption. I was looking for Shauna. Caitlin said I\u2019d find her in here.\u201d</p><p>Fiona offered a small smile. \u201cNot at all. Please, come in. I\u2019m sure you know Detective DeFarge...\u201d Fiona motioned to Jagger.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Danyon said.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ryder Mallory,\u201d Fiona said, introducing him to the man he hadn\u2019t recognized. As soon as Fiona said his name, Danyon remembered that Ryder was the shape-shifter and bounty hunter who had come into town a few months ago in search of the walk-ins. Ryder had been instrumental in bringing that battle to an end. He, along with Caitlin and the leaders of the other subcultures, had literally saved the city from destruction.</p><p>Danyon nodded a greeting to Ryder, and he returned it.</p><p>By this time, Shauna had made her way to his side. She placed a hand on his arm, her touch tentative. \u201cI heard there was another dead were,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cAnd there was no way for me to reach you. I hadn\u2019t heard from you all day and wasn\u2019t sure when you\u2019d be back.\u201d Her sad, beautiful eyes searched his face. \u201cThree dead in two days...I had to do something. We need back up.\u201d</p> <p>He studied her, hoping his eyes relayed the message in his heart, How could you possibly believe I wouldn\u2019t contact you again? Did you honestly think I would simply disappear?</p><p>Shauna dropped her hand from his arm. \u201cEveryone in here knows about Simon and Nicole, Danyon. We also know there\u2019s been a third murder. Who was it? Anyone from here? Where was he or she found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEast Bank were,\u201d Danyon said tersely, then clammed up. He wasn\u2019t about to share any intimate details about Kara\u2019s dead were in front of a vamp and shifter.</p><p>Evidently sensing his reluctance, Shauna said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, really. Everyone here just wants to help.\u201d</p><p>Danyon looked from her to Jagger. \u201cI appreciate the offer, but we can take care of our own.\u201d</p><p>Jagger nodded. \u201cI understand completely. I felt the same way during the cemetery murders six months ago. But I was wrong. Believe me, nobody here is questioning your ability as a leader. We\u2019re only offering more manpower to help you get the job done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important for all of us to stick together,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cWe had major problems with finger pointing during the cemetery murders, and the same when the walk-ins tried to take over the city. The vampires blamed the shape-shifters, the shifters blamed the weres, and so on. Everyone in our respective communities may have calmed considerably since then, but I believe there\u2019s still undercurrents of sensitivity and wariness running through the city. We don\u2019t need that exploding in our faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Ryder said, sidling up to Fiona. \u201cI get where you\u2019re coming from, Danyon. Just like Jagger, when I came here looking for the walk-ins, I had been tracking them for over two years. The last thing I wanted was anyone\u2019s help. Sharing the takedown after all the time I\u2019d spent tracking those bastards was unacceptable to me. But, man, the truth is I had to get over myself. My stubbornness wasn\u2019t helping anybody. People were dying faster than I could count. I needed help fast, whether I liked it or not.\u201d Ryder hooked a thumb in the front pocket of his jeans. \u201cLook, the murderer you\u2019re looking for could be walking down Royal Street this very minute. Maybe scoping out restaurants and bars for that perfect were. Once he targets one, all he has to do is wait him or her out until the end of a work shift, and he\u2019s got himself another victim.\u201d</p><p>Shauna nodded. \u201cTo keep that from happening, we need more eyes keeping watch in and around the city, especially during Nuit du Dommage. More weres will be working overtime at their jobs because of the flood of tourists. We have to protect them. It\u2019s our job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d Danyon snapped.</p><p>\u201cNot only yours,\u201d Shauna shot back. \u201cI\u2019m the weres\u2019 Keeper. It\u2019s my responsibility to keep them safe, too.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her and lowered his voice. \u201cYou should have discussed this with me before telling them.\u201d</p><p>Shauna didn\u2019t even flinch under his stare. Her expression hardened. \u201cI kept my word. Twelve hours, remember? And, for your information, I would have talked to you about it first, but you weren\u2019t around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out about the third were anyway?\u201d Danyon asked. \u201cWho told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanjo Marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA local vamp,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cThe kid lives on the street. Heavy drug user.\u201d</p><p>Danyon frowned. \u201cHow\u2019d he hear about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cBanjo didn\u2019t actually come out and say he knew about Nicole, Simon or a third were for that matter. He sort of...it\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ll have to fill you in later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanyon, we all have a vested interest in this matter,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cI know the victims of the murders have only been weres so far, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll remain that way. Members of the other communities might be targets, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they won\u2019t,\u201d Danyon said, then immediately regretted letting the words out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jagger asked.</p><p>Danyon didn\u2019t answer. The information August had given them about the rogue were, about the metaphysical powers inherent to were claws and fangs, was proprietary knowledge. The only reason August had shared it with them was because he was the victims\u2019 alpha, and Shauna their Keeper. The information wasn\u2019t meant for a vampire or a shape-shifter. In fact, August had specifically told them to keep the knowledge confidential.</p><p>As though reading his mind, Shauna said, \u201cWe have to tell them everything, Danyon. I trust them. All of them. I\u2019d bet my life that whatever we say will never leave this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have our word on that,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten what August said about confidentiality?\u201d Danyon asked Shauna.</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cBut August didn\u2019t actually come out and forbid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSemantics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Besides, I\u2019m the Keeper of the weres, which includes you. I\u2019ll take the responsibility for what is or isn\u2019t said and deal with August myself. You forget that he taught me the ways of a Keeper. Trust me. He\u2019ll understand and respect my decision.\u201d</p><p>Danyon slowly swiped a hand over his mouth. Every one in the room was staring at him intently\u2014waiting. It was obvious Shauna hadn\u2019t revealed everything to them and for that, Danyon was grateful. It left him with a little dignity. Shauna would have probably thought that to be petty, but to an alpha, dignity was paramount. His pride had been bruised when he\u2019d heard them discussing what he considered his business. But the truth was he trusted Shauna. They had only been together for a short time, yet he felt he understood the very core of who she was. And that was more than enough for him to trust her with his life. If she believed that strongly in everyone here, he had no reason not to.</p><p>Hesitantly, Danyon began to recount the story August had shared with him and Shauna. How decades ago a rogue were had been captured and sentenced to death, and why a specific manner of death had been chosen.</p><p>When he was done, everyone stood silent for some time, evidently trying to absorb all he had said.</p><p>Finally, Ryder asked, \u201cIs this common knowledge amongst your people? The special powers in the claws and fangs I mean. And that if they\u2019re stripped away, the were\u2019s heart will burst?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Danyon said.</p><p>\u201cNow I see what you meant when you said the other cultures weren\u2019t at risk,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cBut you\u2019re still going to need help. I think we should get the leaders of the subcultures together and let them know. If\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. This needs to stay low profile,\u201d Danyon said.</p> <p>Jagger held up a hand. \u201cPlease, hear me out. If what you\u2019re saying is true, then the wolven in and around New Orleans aren\u2019t the only ones at risk. This is much bigger than any one group in one city. Weres around the world could be in danger. The only way this is going to be stopped is if we all band together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether the other leaders are told or not, this information has to remain in this room,\u201d Shauna warned. \u201cIf it gets out, other scumbags may decide to jump on the bandwagon right away. The problem gets out of control then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cDanyon, I only offer my opinion on the matter, about including the leaders, so everyone can pitch in and help,\u201d</p><p>Jagger said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll take your lead on this. If you want to keep it just between us, then we\u2019ll honor your decision, and the four of us\u2014Ryder, Fiona, Shauna and I\u2014will do everything we can to support you.\u201d</p> <p>All eyes were on Danyon now.</p><p>As much as he hated to admit it, Jagger was right. He had been so focused on the weres in and around New Orleans that he hadn\u2019t seen the broadness of that scope. Weres in other parts of the United States\u2014around the world\u2014in danger. The vastness of that changed every thing.</p><p>There was only one answer he could give them. Any other response would make him an irresponsible leader.</p><p>And that was unacceptable.</p><p>Danyon agreed to calling the leaders together for a meeting, but kept one thing in mind and to himself. He wasn\u2019t going to just sit on his hands and wait for everyone to join hands in a council meeting. It might take hours, even days, before they got all the leaders together.</p><p>Even an hour was too long to wait. Something had to be done now, before another were died.</p> <p>And he planned to be the one who took care of that something.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Attending a meeting at three in the morning was not something Shauna\u2019s body or mind appreciated. Both had to be forced into compliance. She was surprised they were able to gather everyone so quickly. The leaders of the three major subcultures in New Orleans owned their own businesses, which made them difficult to pin down even with extended notice. Compound that with the record number of tourists swarming the city right now, and this morning\u2019s meeting was nothing short of a miracle.</p><p>Since the business to be discussed was about the weres, August had offered his conference room for the gathering. The elder\u2019s response to having the meeting in the first place had been Shauna\u2019s second surprise. She\u2019d expected August to be miffed that she had taken matters into her own hands and leaked word about the murders, along with some of the confidential details surrounding them. To her amazement, August took the news very well. In fact, he even commended her, saying that keeping the twelve hour vow of silence she had made with Danyon, then carefully deliberating matters before making the decision to get the others involved, showed initiative and integrity, all signs of an excellent Keeper. She had been taken aback and humbled by his praise.</p><p>Shauna and her sisters usually met with August and the leaders of the other subcultures at least once a year. The purpose of that meeting was to share basic information about city business, as it pertained to each race, and to generally keep tabs on one another. In the past year, however, they had had to meet multiple times due to major problems plaguing the city.</p><p>Six months ago, it had been the cemetery murders. Two women were discovered lying across tombs in a local cemetery, each dead and completely drained of blood. The exsanguinations heaped suspicion onto the vampires, then fingers pointed to the shape-shifters since they were able to mimic a vampire in appearance and action. Not much was said about the werewolves then, because weres are basic black-and-white. When they kill, they usually slaughter, and the bodies of both women had been in pristine condition. Regardless, that hadn\u2019t stopped one race from accusing the other. Everyone had been on edge.</p><p>The situation worsened three months later, when a group of rogue walk-ins tried taking over the city. It was then that Ryder Mallory came into town. Ryder was a bounty hunter and a shape-shifter, and he had been tracking the rogue walk-ins for quite some time. The number of casualties from the walk-in invasion exceeded those from the cemetery murders. So did the number of suspects. This time every race was subject to blame, and the accusations flew at lightning speed. Had it not been for Ryder, Caitlin and Jagger, the entire city of New Orleans might have been destroyed.</p><p>Now, here they were again.</p> <p>Another crisis. More death.</p><p>Had there ever been a time when the world was quiet? When no blood was shed because of someone or something\u2019s greed or anger? When no one had to fight to protect some small corner of the earth they called home?</p><p>And what about the future? Was it possible to have one without strife and pain? Wars were still fought in the name of peace, and strife still flowed through the streets of the world in the name of equality. Every generation basically did the same thing as the one before it. If the definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results, then Shauna figured the future was pretty much doomed right out of the gate. All anyone could do was the best they could do with the life that was given to them. Everything else seemed up for grabs.</p><p>Shauna was just settling into a chair at the table in August\u2019s conference room, when Rita, August\u2019s assistant, ushered Danyon inside.</p><p>They exchanged smiles as Rita rearranged a tray of pastries. Danyon paused near the empty chair beside Shauna, then moved to the opposite side of the table and sat across from her. At first, Shauna didn\u2019t understand why he had purposely chosen not to sit beside her. Then it struck her...</p><p>When Andy Saville had arrived at the scene of Simon\u2019s murder, the were had given her a look that said, \u2018You\u2019re a woman\u2014a kid\u2014what the hell are you doing here?\u2019 Had it not been for Danyon creating an environment of acceptance, her presence would not have been tolerated, and she never would have been taken seriously. He was doing the same thing for her now by choosing that particular position at the table. Ninety percent of the attendees would be male, and Danyon knew if he sat beside her, any time one of the leaders had a question, they would direct it to him simply because he was male and an alpha. She might have been a Keeper, but she was still female and young, and the leaders weren\u2019t used to her being a front-runner at the council meetings. Fiona always took that position. Today would be different, though. Everyone would be discussing weres, which were Shauna\u2019s responsibility\u2014and that meant she would be plopped right on top of first base. Danyon was giving her the room she needed to be a real part of the team.</p><p>Within a couple minutes of Danyon\u2019s arrival, Fiona and Jagger appeared, and following them, Caitlin and Ryder. Jagger and Ryder didn\u2019t carry leadership titles in their cultures, but Jagger\u2019s experience as a homicide detective and Ryder\u2019s as a bounty hunter made both invaluable assets, so they had been asked to attend.</p><p>Next in line was David Dulac, leader of the vampires and the owner of a club called The Underworld, which was located on Esplanade. It was unlike any other bar in the city. The building was a deconsecrated church, and it still sported stained glass windows, a cavernous main section and multiple balconies and private rooms. David never did anything in a small way.</p><p>Trailing David was Armand St. Pierre, the acting head of all the shape-shifters and the owner of Muriel\u2019s, one of the higher-end restaurants in New Orleans. Save for August, Shauna found Armand to be one of the more elegant leaders. He had an aristocratic air about him. To those who didn\u2019t know Armand, he might have been considered snobbish, when that wasn\u2019t really the case. He was simply a very private man.</p><p>August arrived last, and he immediately surveyed the silver tea and coffee pots in the center of the conference table, along with the fresh croissants and p\u00e2t\u00e8, shrimp puffs and beignets. Evidently satisfied that there was plenty for all to eat and drink, August dismissed Rita with a nod.</p><p>As soon as the conference room door closed behind her, August said, \u201cPlease be seated at your leisure, everyone.\u201d Even at three in the morning, August looked rested and ready for business. His black Armani suit had not one wrinkle, and his long, silvery-white hair was combed away from his face, not a strand out of place.</p><p>He took his place at the head of the table. \u201cI want to thank all of you for clearing your calendars so we could meet quickly, and for your willingness to attend at such an early hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Ryder said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry for your losses, August,\u201d Armand said.</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d David Dulac said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019ve called us together. Things might look like they\u2019ve settled down in the city after the disaster we had with the walk-ins, but to tell you the truth, my people have been riding on the edge of panic ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone in your group stick out as particularly jumpy or nervous lately?\u201d Ryder asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you ask that?\u201d David said, his tone defensive. \u201cWhy pick on my group? I\u2019m sure every leader here can testify that their communities are just as antsy since the walk-ins. We\u2019ve gone through a lot this year.\u201d</p><p>Ryder held up a hand. \u201cHang on, I didn\u2019t mean to single out your group. One of the reasons we\u2019re here is to figure out what to do about this situation, right? In order for us to do that, we need to be able to lay everything out on the table. That includes looking at the possibility that someone in our own community could be the murderer. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s uncomfortable for everyone here, but it\u2019s necessary if we\u2019re to get to the bottom of this quickly. Right now, it appears that weres are the murderer\u2019s target, but we don\u2019t know how long it will stay that way. All of our people could be in danger. So, please, don\u2019t take my question personally. I just thought it would be a good jumping off point since you mentioned your group was still edgy from the last crisis.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was just stating an observation,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cNo harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everyone is still on edge,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cIn my opinion, we not only have to figure out a way to find the murderer, we have to do it without adding more tension between our people. One way to do that is by keeping the investigation low profile, although I suspect word has already gotten out about the deaths. Regardless, you, as leaders, can do a lot to minimize the tension, but, as Ryder said, it has to start here. The doors to this office are closed. No one outside of this group will know where the clues are leading us or if they\u2019re aiming at a specific group. It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014human, shifter, vampire...\u201d He looked over at Danyon, then August. \u201cEven were. In this room, all bets are off when it comes to getting to the truth of this matter. Outside of this room, we have to be supportive of one another and encourage our people to do the same.\u201d</p> <p>August laced his arms together and rested them on the table. \u201cJagger and Ryder are right. As leader of the weres, I know how much pride a leader takes in his people. It is always easier to look at someone else, another race, another culture, and label them suspect. But it is very difficult to look at our own and do the same because it feels like a personal insult. In this case, however, if we don\u2019t put our pride aside and be willing to look at everything, even our own, we could be setting ourselves up for the war of the century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s a smidgeon over the top, August?\u201d Armand said, while pouring himself a cup of coffee. \u201cCertainly the death of three weres is not to be taken lightly, but you, Jagger and Ryder are making it sound like we\u2019ve had a massacre, or the commencement to one. Why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I may...?\u201d Jagger said, looking to August for permission to answer the question posed to him.</p><p>August nodded his consent.</p><p>\u201cBecause of extenuating circumstances,\u201d Jagger said to Armand. \u201cThey lead us to believe that the stage is being set for an all out massacre, particularly of weres. The evidence has lead us to conclude we\u2019re not only looking at the possibility of that occurring, but that it\u2019s inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are the extenuating circumstances?\u201d David asked.</p><p>Shauna held up a hand before Jagger could answer. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, David, but for safety\u2019s sake, the circumstances Jagger referred to can\u2019t be revealed. It would endanger too many more lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait a minute,\u201d David said, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cYou call us together to help, but you\u2019re not going to give us all of the details? What\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow absurd,\u201d Armand said. \u201cIf you expect us to develop a strategy to end this plight, then the sharing of information is quite necessary, my dear.\u201d</p><p>Shauna had to bite her tongue to keep from shooting off at the mouth. She hated when a male, human or otherwise, took the liberty to call her \u201cdear\u201d or \u201choney.\u201d To her, it sounded so damn patronizing. Armand\u2019s tone didn\u2019t help matters either. He might as well have said to her, \u201cGo play, little girl. The grownups have real work to do.\u201d</p><p>Fiona suddenly stood up, leaned over, and pressed her fingertips to the table. She peered at each male in the room before her eyes settled on David Dulac. \u201cDavid, I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions.\u201d</p> <p>David cocked his head, his brow furrowing. \u201cOkay, shoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs Keeper of the vampires in this city, do you trust my judgment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImplicitly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I am loyal to our race?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe the decisions I make for our race are made with the vampires\u2019 best interests at heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Fiona asked. \u201cIs it only because I carry the title Keeper?\u201d</p> <p>Armand tsked. \u201cOh, Fiona, now please. You know you\u2019re held in high regard by your entire race. It is the same for the shifters, and how we feel about our Keeper. Caitlin earned our trust a long time ago. We believe in her loyalty because she proves it time and time again. And we know the stock she comes from. Heavens, your mother and father were strong, wise leaders, so adored by all. No one ever doubted their word or intentions. Now granted, your parents\u2019 reputation alone gave Caitlin carte blanche to our hearts, but it is being who she is, along with all she does for the shifters, that truly connects her to the very soul of our race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSucking up for a larger Christmas gift this year, aren\u2019t you, Armand?\u201d Caitlin teased.</p><p>He grinned impishly. \u201cwww-dot-tiffanys-dot-com.\u201d</p><p>Fiona winked at Caitlin and Shauna. \u201cThat was eloquently put, Armand. Thank you. I think Caitlin is extraordinary, as well. And so is Shauna\u2014which brings me to my point. I would ask that all of you remember that just because she\u2019s the youngest Keeper, does not mean she deserves less respect. As Keepers, our word is our bond. It means everything. And when we, as Keepers, address you, the leaders of the cultures we are responsible for, it is always with your best interest in mind, not ours. So, David\u2014Armand, if Shauna says that revealing certain information would endanger more lives, her words should be taken as fact. The information is not being kept from you as a power play.\u201d</p><p>With that, Fiona sat down and busied herself with a croissant. Shauna wanted to reach over the table and hug her sister for standing up for her, literally and figuratively. It was the first time she truly felt like their equal. Not just Fiona and Caitlin\u2019s little sister.</p><p>\u201cNow, if we can get back to the business at hand,\u201d August said, placing his elbows on the table and steepling his fingers.</p><p>From where Shauna sat, she could see the small smile hiding behind his fingers. He was obviously pleased, as well, that Fiona had stood up for her.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, at the moment, we don\u2019t have much to work with in respect to clues,\u201d August said. \u201cAlphas from Lake Charles to New Orleans\u2019 West Bank have been instructed to place their strongest, most loyal weres at post. They\u2019re to keep an eye out for any unusual activity or people, beings, what have you. The challenge is we don\u2019t know what we are looking for, which brings us to one of the main questions in this case. Who or what has the strength to restrain a were once he\u2019s transformed? If we knew that answer, it would at least give us a target to aim at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope this won\u2019t be taken the wrong way,\u201d Armand said. \u201cLike I\u2019m unwilling to offer up my own as possible suspects, you know? But honestly, I seriously doubt the murderer is a shifter. Most of us are my size, tall and slender. Just a willow in the forest of life.\u201d</p><p>Shauna turned her head, so Armand wouldn\u2019t see her rolling her eyes.</p><p>Armand sighed heavily. \u201cMy point is that not even a dozen shifters cemented together could hold down a were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if those twelve shifted into something larger than a were?\u201d Ryder asked. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be possible then?\u201d</p><p>Armand shot him a look. \u201cWhose side are you on, Mr. Mallory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the side of justice,\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening to what\u2019s been said? Each of us has to be willing to put our own on the table for examination. Even shifters.\u201d</p><p>This time Armand was the one to roll his eyes. He tsked and looked away, all but saying, \u201cGo away, little gnat, go away,\u201d despite all the virtues he\u2019d just proclaimed about Caitlin.</p><p>\u201cThey could have shifted into something bigger than a were,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cBut when a shifter changes, doesn\u2019t he or she have to mentally map what they\u2019re changing into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cUnless they go into auto-shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen a shifter is young and shifts for the first time, nine times out of ten, it\u2019s random, almost accidental,\u201d Ryder explained. \u201cOne day a dog, a cat, a bird, whatever, catches their attention, and, in that moment, for some odd reason, mother nature decides it\u2019s time for their first shift. So whatever they\u2019re focused on gets imprinted on their brain, and they never have to mind map that particular thing again. For many shifters, whenever they get frightened or sense danger, their shifter nature goes into automatic response and shifts them into whatever imprinted itself in the very beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they have to mind map something or someone before changing into it, what or who is bigger than a full grown were in this area?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cAndy Saville,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cMan, that guy is big,\u201d Ryder said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s also wolven,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cEverything gets put on the table, remember?\u201d</p><p>Shauna nodded hesitantly. She would have bet everything she owned, or ever would own during this lifetime, that Andy was not the murderer.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think a vampire is completely out of the question,\u201d David said. \u201cA vamp can\u2019t shift into just anything they please. If one did attack a were, the fight would have been fang to fang. A vamp wouldn\u2019t bother wrapping silver around a were, only to remove his claws and fangs. He\u2019d simply rip his throat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the vamp could catch him,\u201d Danyon said, with a lopsided grin.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if a group of vampires glamoured a were?\u201d Caitlin asked. \u201cIs that possible? Could they glamour a were long enough to restrain him? Once he\u2019s secured, all they\u2019d have to do is release the glamour, and the were\u2019s anger would force his transformation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...possible,\u201d David said, after giving it a moment\u2019s thought. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s probable. What would they have to gain? From what we\u2019ve been told, the murdered weres lost a lot of blood. Vampires wouldn\u2019t have wasted an opportunity like that. The were would have been drained dry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat about humans?\u201d Fiona asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how a human, or even a group of them, could have done it,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cThey would have had to subdue the were in human form, and any attempt to restrain him would have caused the were to transform. Once that happened, no human would stand a chance. One swipe of a paw, and the were would literally claw the human\u2019s face off, or rip his heart out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see what you mean about the unlikelihood of it being a human,\u201d David said. \u201cBut humans can be very stupid sometimes. No offense, ladies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone taken,\u201d Fiona said.</p><p>\u201cI can just see some drunk yahoo and his buddies suddenly thinking they have superpowers and deciding to add a were-head to their trophy wall back home.\u201d David shrugged. \u201cNot hard to imagine with humans, is it?\u201d</p><p>Armand snorted in disgust. \u201cWith humans? No. Stupid is as stupid does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking about stupid,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cWord has it that some new biker gang rode into town about a week ago. They call themselves BGW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that stand for?\u201d Armand asked. \u201cBig, gold watch?\u201d</p> <p>Jagger grinned. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s supposed to stand for Blood, Guts and Women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow original,\u201d Caitlin said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t had any run-ins with the eighth precinct yet, so I don\u2019t have much information on them. I do know, though, that the gang leader\u2019s name is Frank Macina, but the members of his gang call him Big Frank. And with good reason. The guy is six-five and weighs about four hundred pounds. A stereotypical biker, even down to his bald head, which has naked women tattooed all over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how tacky,\u201d Armand said.</p><p>\u201cThe word on the street is they plan to upstage the Bloods and the Crips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat chance of that happening,\u201d Ryder said, \u201cThe Bs and Cs are two of the most hard-core gangs in America. If this so called BGW gang plans to nudge into their territory, they\u2019d better go armed with Uzies and lots of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt might not be a bad idea to talk with Macina,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cI could be pointing at shadows here, but it seems a little too coincidental that the murders happened about the same time Big Frank and his gang got here. Might be worth checking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething else we may want to check out,\u201d Shauna said. Everyone turned to her, which made her nervous, so she looked at August and kept her focus on him. \u201cBanjo Marks came into the store yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanjo Marks?\u201d August asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d David said. \u201cHe\u2019s a vamp from an old bayou family who never quite fits in anywhere. Banjo does his own thing and is always high on something. To be honest, I think the kid is some sort of a half-breed and don\u2019t ask me how that\u2019s possible, because I don\u2019t have a clue. I know he\u2019s a vamp because I\u2019ve seen his fangs, and I\u2019ve seen him feed. But I\u2019ve also seen him eat food and sleep so hard at night he\u2019d snore. There is just something really off about the guy. He\u2019s homeless, as far as I know. Walks the streets and begs for loose change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanjo just needs someone to tend to him, to care about him, that\u2019s all,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cThe kid comes into the shop a couple of times a week, and he always looks half starved. I know what you mean about him eating, David, because Banjo does eat and drink whatever I give him, just like a human. When he first started coming to A Little Bit of Magic, I didn\u2019t even know he was a vamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be you to feed tea and cake to a junkie vamp,\u201d Jagger said, the adoration on his face blatant.</p><p>\u201cOh, she\u2019d take in a stray skunk if it crossed our threshold,\u201d Caitlin said. \u201cShe\u2019ll mother anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what about this Banjo Marks?\u201d August asked Shauna.</p> <p>\u201cHe came into the store yesterday, acting really weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanjo always acts weird,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWeirder than usual,\u201d Shauna explained. \u201cFiona had brought cookies to the shop that morning, and Banjo claimed he smelled them from across the street, and he wanted some. He was creating such havoc in the store, Fiona tried bringing him back into the office, offering to fix him a sandwich, but he refused to go, yelling that he wanted cookies instead. He was really wired, like he\u2019d taken a mega dose of cocaine. Then he fixated on me, sing-songing that he\u2019d trade me a secret for a cookie. When I finally gave him one and he ate it, he started talking about three dead blind mice, no teeth, and something about no big fingernails, and his voice changed when he said it. Sort of low and monotone. Not the chitter talk he\u2019d been doing since he arrived. When I tried to get more information out of him, he ran out of the store. In Banjo\u2019s jumbled up way, I think he was trying to tell me that he knew about three dead weres and that their claws and fangs had been removed. I only knew about two of the weres then. How could he have possibly known all that?\u201d Shauna wanted to tell them more\u2014elaborate about Banjo\u2019s heightened sense of smell, about Banjo and Mattress Mattie\u2019s fight, and how she\u2019d dented the light pole with a fist. But she didn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t. Not without revealing what August had told her and Danyon about the metaphysical powers in were claws and fangs.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you can trust anything Banjo says or does,\u201d David said. \u201cHalf the time he can\u2019t even remember his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not be able to trust him,\u201d Armand said, with a flap of a hand, \u201cbut I\u2019d love to have a little of whatever he was on right about now. I\u2019ve been so exhausted lately. Probably becoming anemic. I could use the energy boost.\u201d</p><p>Caitlin glared at him, and Armand tsked and turned away.</p><p>\u201cAll I ask,\u201d August said, \u201cis that you stay alert, keep an eye out for unusual activity, whether it is within your circle or outside of it, human or some other subculture. Nuit du Dommage is tomorrow, and all of you know how crazy it gets during that time. Because of the holiday, many were will be working longer hours, especially at night. That concerns me. With so many tourists in the city, it will be difficult to discern the unusual from the drunken norm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEyes wide open here,\u201d David said.</p><p>Armand nodded. \u201cSame for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you probably have an alpha who\u2019s already stationed weres to keep watch on the West Bank, August,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cBut I have a friend on the force there. Really sharp guy. I\u2019ll ride over and talk to him. Find out if he\u2019s seen or heard anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about Luke Simms?\u201d David asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Luke\u2019s a very smart vamp. Not much gets past him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re taking the West Bank, then I\u2019ll take a couple of shifters with me Lakeside,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cWe\u2019ll check out that area, then head north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the Quarter covered,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cI want to find this Banjo character and the leader of that new biker gang, Big Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may want to let me take Frank,\u201d Jagger said.</p><p>\u201cHis gang might not have a lot of muscle yet, but that can make them twice as dangerous. They still have to prove to everyone how tough they are, you know? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m in no way saying you can\u2019t handle Frank. I\u2019m just thinking that if he sees a badge, it might temper his mood.\u201d</p><p>Danyon smiled, but the gesture looked more menacing than pleasing. \u201cI\u2019m wolven, remember? I think I can handle Big Frank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cover the Quarter with you,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>Danyon\u2019s head snapped back as though he\u2019d been shot. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll go with you Lakeside,\u201d Caitlin said to Ryder.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Ryder said adamantly. \u201cI know you and Shauna want to help, but it\u2019s crazy enough out there. The last thing I need is to be worrying about you getting hurt, while I\u2019m trying to dig up a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with Ryder and Danyon,\u201d Jagger said. \u201cI think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may want to think again,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m going with you to the West Bank. I know I don\u2019t have to remind you that the three of us are Keepers. We protect and look after our race.\u201d</p><p>Jagger shook his head, held up a finger. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cThe end.\u201d</p><p>After ten more minutes of round table debates, the men finally conceded\u2014as Shauna suspected they would.</p><p>When they finally adjourned, it was with the understanding that everyone would meet back in the conference room the morning after Nuit du Dommage so they could compare notes and share any new evidence.</p><p>As they stepped out of August\u2019s office complex and onto the street, Danyon took Shauna by the arm and pulled her closer to him.</p><p>\u201cI know toward the end there I said it was okay for you to come with me, but I really don\u2019t want you to,\u201d he whispered. \u201cThere\u2019ll be so many people out tonight. If I end up chasing a lead, I could lose you in the crowd. Shauna, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if you got hurt.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against him and whispered back, \u201cI promise, I won\u2019t get hurt.\u201d</p><p>He sighed heavily, and Shauna closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, taking in the air he had exhaled. She felt her body flush with heat. The response seemed inappropriate, considering the seriousness of the matter they had met about only moments ago. But she couldn\u2019t help it. She was no more in control of her body\u2019s reaction to Danyon, than she was to the cloud cover overhead.</p><p>He touched her cheek, then lifted her chin gently, until her eyes met his. Under his gaze, every molecule inside her sprang to life.</p><p>And, as was always the case when Danyon touched her, the rest of the world simply vanished.</p><p>She only wished when it returned again, it would be sans a murderer.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Shauna actually felt hope as she stepped into the shower. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The meeting at August\u2019s had gone better than she\u2019d hoped. Everyone in attendance seemed eager to help. With Jagger and Fiona working the West Bank, Ryder and Caitlin going Lakeside, and she and Danyon covering the French Quarter, they would have New Orleans pretty well covered. August had taken care of the rest of South Louisiana by having the alphas post sentinels around their territories. David and Armand would keep an eye on the traffic that flowed through their bar and restaurant. The Underworld and Muriel\u2019s were famous hot spots in the city, and eventually every tourist wound up visiting one or both. If anything new or unusual, aside from the standard freaks, who showed their behinds during Nuit du Dommage, David and Armand would either see it or hear about it.</p><p>They still didn\u2019t have any solid clues to work with, but with so many eyes and ears on alert, they stood a far better chance of finding some than they did when it was only her and Danyon.</p><p>Danyon had not exactly been forthcoming during the meeting with the leaders of the other cultures. But she admired the fact that he had put aside his reservations for the sake of the were community.</p> <p>It had to be difficult being an alpha. She knew the challenges that came with being a leader, but an alpha carried much more. Not only did he have the responsibility of his pack, he had a take-charge-and-fix-it switch that never shut off. He always ran ahead, taking bullets for those behind him. It had to have felt awkward for Danyon as he stepped to one side and allowed others to join him in the lead.</p><p>At first, when all of this began, Shauna had thought pride kept him from accepting help\u2014hers or anyone else\u2019s. Though there may have been a little truth to that; it wasn\u2019t the kind of pride that made for glory-hounds. Danyon wasn\u2019t about basking in the glory of anything. He really cared about his pack, about wolvens as a whole. She found him to be honest, honorable and a bit hard-headed\u2014but who was she to talk?</p><p>It was impossible for Shauna not to notice that each time she thought about him, her heart thumped a bit faster and her body grew a whole lot warmer. There was no question that little Miss Stay-in-Control was falling out of control fast, and there didn\u2019t seem to be a way to stop it\u2014not that she would have wanted to.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a prude by any means. There had been other men in her life, even though they were few. Some she had gone out with because they were funny or intelligent, or both. Most had been decent sex partners. But every one of them had lacked something that kept her from fully committing to them.</p><p>Danyon was different.</p> <p>He simply got her.</p><p>And he did it without her having to explain a thing to him. He seemed to intuitively know what she was about, who she was at her core. She saw it in the way he looked at her, talked to her, made love to her. She could be herself with Danyon and not be afraid that any part of who she was would be rejected.</p><p>Shauna considered herself lucky, because there had been one point in her life when she probably wouldn\u2019t have even given herself a chance to get to know him.</p><p>About two years ago, she\u2019d gone to a party with a guy named Lance Miller, a smart, right-out-of-the-gate successful entrepreneur, who she\u2019d been dating for about a month. The party had been for his younger cousin, Brian\u2019s, birthday, and it was packed with younger people whose music of choice had been heavy metal. The music had been cranked up so loud Shauna had thought her eardrums would burst. She had to get out of there and fast. When she told this to Lance and tried to explain how sensitive her hearing was, he had looked at her as if she had grown an additional head and three extra nostrils. Even worse, he had been drinking rather heavily, which was obviously all he had needed to convert back to a juvenile. He started making fun of her in front of his cousin\u2019s friends, who in turn made certain to shout whenever they spoke to her, crank up the music another ten decibels, and intermittently blow air horns in the house for over an hour.</p><p>She had stormed out of there, leaving Lance to play with the rest of the juvenile delinquents. It was the last time she had spoken to Lance, much less saw him. After that experience, it had taken her a while to gather up enough courage to date again.</p><p>For Shauna, physical attraction only played a bit role when it came to relationships. There were so many other things far more important. Like enjoying each other\u2019s company, valuing each other\u2019s uniqueness\u2014being able to laugh together, play together, appreciate similar things and having mutual interests and values.</p> <p>Danyon was right on the mark in all those areas...</p><p>She turned the knob on the shower head, intensifying the spray. Standing anywhere thinking about Danyon was distracting for her. Standing naked in a soothing shower and thinking about him was downright physical torture.</p><p>She grabbed a loofah and a bottle of body wash, and was about to start scrubbing away when she thought she heard the chimes of the doorbell.</p><p>Puzzled, Shauna turned off the shower.</p><p>In order for someone to reach the doorbell, they had to get past a ten-foot tall, wrought iron gate. The only way for them to get through that gate was to be buzzed in by someone in the main section of the house. Fiona and Caitlin had left over an hour ago to meet Jagger and Ryder, so neither of them could have buzzed anyone through. It was possible that whoever went through the gate last may not have closed it all the way, then left, thinking it had latched.</p><p>Shauna waited a few more seconds, listening, but heard nothing more.</p><p>She was about to turn the shower back on, when she heard the chimes go off again.</p><p>\u201cWho the heck can that be?\u201d she asked aloud, and stepped out of the shower.</p> <p>After wrapping herself in a towel, she padded out of the bathroom and her apartment, quickly heading for the main section of the house and the front door. Danyon wasn\u2019t due to meet her for another hour and a half, and she wasn\u2019t expecting any other company. She figured she\u2019d look through the peephole to make certain it wasn\u2019t some kind of emergency\u2014like someone standing out there on fire, but unless that was the case, she had no intentions of letting whoever it was into the house.</p><p>When she reached the front door, Shauna was surprised to see Danyon standing on the other side of the peephole. A thought occurred to her, and she bit her bottom lip. They had discussed the possibility of one or more shape-shifters being responsible for the murders, and although the idea had been given little merit, no one knew for sure if they weren\u2019t. What if the man standing outside her door was a shifter posing as Danyon? She would have to let him in to know for certain. A shifter might be able to take on his appearance, but not Danyon\u2019s natural scent, which was something she knew very, very well. The only problem was she had to be close enough to him to smell it, which meant letting him into the house, which defeated the purpose. Then she remembered something...</p><p>Shauna pressed an ear to the thin crack between the door and the door frame, near one of the hinges. She squeezed her eyes shut, concentrated and prayed that her hypersensitive hearing wouldn\u2019t fail her now.</p><p>It didn\u2019t.</p><p>In a matter of seconds she heard it\u2014the sound of his breathing. The same sound she had heard when Danyon had whispered her name\u2014the same that had followed his moans of pleasure. She would know it anywhere\u2014and knew that a shifter could not mimic breathing patterns.</p><p>Now that she was certain it was Danyon, Shauna suddenly felt a rush of panic, and her eyes flew open. What if he was bringing news about another dead were? She quickly unlocked the door and threw it open, forgetting she was dressed only in a towel.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, not bothering with the standard hello.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, looking a little surprised\u2014and amused.</p><p>\u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you greet all of your guests this way?\u201d</p><p>Shauna leaned to one side, looked past his left arm, and saw that the wrought iron gate was closed. \u201cJust the ones I work with on murders scenes. How did you get past the gate?\u201d</p><p>Danyon looked down at his feet. \u201cUh...long legs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wall and gate are ten feet tall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay...I took pole vaulting in high school?\u201d</p><p>Shauna smiled and motioned him inside. It wasn\u2019t until she closed the door that she realized she was wrapped only in a towel. She clutched it tightly to make sure it stayed closed.</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m not dressed yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWas in the shower. Besides, you said you\u2019d be here at ten. It\u2019s a little before eight-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we\u2019d get a bite to eat before hitting the Quarter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have called to give me a heads up, you know.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSpur of the moment thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you always this spontaneous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it...not really. It just sounded like a good excuse for being early.\u201d</p><p>Shauna laughed softly. \u201cFair enough. Come in then. You can have a seat in my apartment while I get dressed.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they left the foyer and entered commons central, Danyon let out a low whistle of appreciation.</p><p>\u201cVery nice,\u201d he said, taking in the two curving stair cases, the wall tapestries, the chandelier and heavy oak furniture.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sisters deserve all the cred it, though. I have the interior decorating talent of a porcupine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I bet you have a great sense of style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. If they had left me to decorate this place, it would look like an oversized garage.\u201d She grinned. \u201cFiona lives over there, in the west wing, and Caitlin lives in the east wing. My place is straight ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great that each of you have your individual space, but still live under one roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. I mean don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my sisters dearly, but we\u2019d probably get on each other\u2019s nerves if we had to live in the same space every day.\u201d</p><p>When they finally reached her apartment, Shauna signaled for him to follow her through the open door. She had obviously forgotten to close it in her mad dash to see who was at the main entry. \u201cHere we are,\u201d she said.</p><p>She watched him look over the place from the corner of her eye. Judging by his smile, he evidently approved. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid your sisters decorate your apartment, as well?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, no,\u201d Shauna said, closing the apartment door.</p><p>His smile broadened. \u201cYou see? I was right. You do have style.\u201d</p> <p>Shauna felt herself blush. \u201cYeah, well...\u201d She glanced away before he could see her turn red and waved a hand toward the couch. \u201cMake yourself comfortable. I won\u2019t be long,\u201d she said, then turned to head for the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cShauna?\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice brought her to a halt in mid-step. The tone of it had changed, and she suddenly felt like a million butterflies were fluttering in her chest. She held the towel in a death grip and turned slowly around, only to find him standing inches away from her.</p><p>The smile had faded from his lips, but his eyes were soft and warm. He reached out and gently cupped her face in his large hands.</p><p>\u201cThe real reason I came early was because I wanted to try and talk you out of coming tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion already. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>Danyon placed a thumb over her lips, silencing her. \u201cI already know what you\u2019re going to say. Look, hear me out, please.\u201d</p><p>She saw worry in his eyes and nodded hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows your loyalty and commitment to weres is exemplary,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to prove anything to anyone.\u201d</p><p>She tried to speak, to let him know that her desire to be involved had nothing to do with proving herself to anyone, but he kept his thumb firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that it\u2019s Nuit du Dommage,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know how it brings out all the crazies. But we\u2019re looking for a murderer here, Shauna\u2014a sick psychopath. Remember what he did to Simon and Nicole? If he can do that to two young weres who would\u2019ve never harmed a soul\u2014I don\u2019t even want to imagine what he might do to you.\u201d</p> <p>She tried once again to speak, and he placed his other thumb over her lips, obviously determined to finish saying what was on his mind.</p><p>\u201cI understand that as a Keeper you have to look out for the safety and welfare of the weres in this city. But who takes on that responsibility if something happens to you? Think about it.\u201d He held her face a little tighter and looked deeply into her eyes. \u201cI meant what I said when we were leaving the meeting this morning, Shauna. I really don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if something happened to you.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to reassure him, but his lips replaced his thumbs, and she lost the words.</p><p>His kiss was tender, and his tongue soon parted her lips, seeking the warmth of her mouth. She felt his hands in her hair\u2014he pulled her closer.</p><p>And she melted into him.</p><p>Cupping the back of her head with one hand, he lowered his lips to her neck and lightly brushed them against her skin. The heat emanating from him set her body ablaze. She moaned, desire flooding her and bringing with it a need so great it made her tremble. Her moans soon became small gasps, as his lips moved lower. He kept his touch light and traced the edge of the towel that covered her breasts with his tongue.</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she had let go of the towel until she felt it fall away from her body. His free hand moved surely over the swell of her left breast and gently stroked her nipple. It was already hard and aching for his lips\u2014his tongue. She held her breath as his mouth moved toward it, then gasped when he suddenly scooped her up in his arms. She\u2019d been so consumed and blinded by need, she hadn\u2019t seen that coming.</p><p>He carried her over to the couch, laid her on it, then leaned over her and pressed his lips to hers once again. Her mouth opened to him, and his kiss quickly matched the hunger of her own. She held on to him as his hands caressed her body, one sliding down between her legs and gently urging them open. His long, thick fingers were sure but tender as they pressed against her swollen, wet mound. She arched her back, urging his fingers inside her. But he would not be rushed...</p> <p>His lips traveled slowly down the length of her neck while the tip of one finger teased her hungry lips below, pushing past them, but barely, only enough to drive her mad. Her moans became a constant, her breathing nearly non-existent. She dug her fingernails into his back, lifted her hips. His finger slipped inside her just a little, as he slowly licked his way to her breasts, down her stomach...</p><p>By the time his mouth and tongue replaced the fingers between her legs, it took but a second for her body to unleash a massive orgasm that felt as if it had been building since the beginning of time. She screamed from the force of it, bucked her hips against him, and his tongue deftly lapped all she had to offer.</p><p>Everything became a blur except him\u2014he stood, and in less than a moment he was naked, and the thick hardness between his legs visibly throbbed, revealing his own need. She reached for him, ravenous, took him into her mouth, her tongue tingling with delight at the taste of him. He groaned loudly and she could tell by the swell of him that he was trying to contain the explosion desperate to leave his body.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before he pulled her away, leaned over and kissed her hard. Then his body was stretched over the length of hers, his hands on either side of her head, keeping the full weight of him off of her. She felt the bulk and length of him, hard and hot, rub against her, and she wrapped her legs around him possessively.</p><p>She cried out when he finally entered her, thrusting against him. Their bodies quickly fell into a fast, hard rhythm, neither able to control the fire raging inside of them any longer. His lips found hers, and his tongue moved in tandem with his long, deep thrusts, muffling her cries of pleasure. Her release sent her bucking wildly against him, contracting around him. He lifted his head, let out a loud groan, and she felt his hot release filling her.</p><p>Then he shifted his body carefully, slowly, until he was lying beside her in the narrow space. He held her close, both of them sweating, panting, trembling.</p><p>She closed her eyes, relishing the utter satisfaction washing over her.</p><p>Then, without thinking, she pressed a hand to his chest over his heart. Its soft, steady rhythm pulsed beneath her palm, and she marveled at how familiar it felt. As though she had known the beat of him for many lifetimes and would treasure it for many more.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Danyon had made some stupid decisions in his life, but deciding to walk down Bourbon Street the night of Nuit du Dommage with Shauna in tow, weighed in at the top of the list. There were so many people walking the streets, he could barely turn in any direction. Had Shauna been any shorter than five foot eight inches, he would have had to tether her to make certain she wasn\u2019t swept away by all the pushing, shoving, and stumbling.</p><p>Even worse was the noise level. There was music, voices, shouting, car horns, police whistles, even the clop-clop-clop of horse hooves as the rental carriages went by. All of the sounds rose and fell in pitch and volume, and it pained his ears.</p><p>Danyon knew Shauna was having the same problem with the noise from the way she flinched from time to time and lowered an ear to her shoulders as though to block the sounds. He was surprised to find her so vulnerable. But lately, he often found himself surprised by her. He found his thoughts drifting back to her apartment, where they were only a couple hours ago, to the feel of her body, her lips... Before long, he had to literally shake his head to get his mind back on track.</p><p>He forced himself to think about Banjo Marks, and all Shauna had told him about the drugged out vamp. How his senses appeared to be heightened when he\u2019d gone into A Little Bit of Magic, demanding cookies and claiming that he had smelled them from across the street. Danyon also remembered what Shauna had told him about a woman named Mattress Mattie, and how she had fought with Banjo in front of the shop, then punched a heavy metal lamp post instead of the vamp, and dented it.</p><p>If August was right about anyone being able to ingest a were\u2019s claws and fangs simply by pulverizing them, and through that ingestion, they would gain certain were attributes, like speed, heightened senses\u2014strength, then was it possible that Banjo\u2014and Mattie\u2014had stumbled on to a supply? If they had, that meant a supply source\u2014a supplier\u2014the murderer? He had to question Banjo to find out more.</p><p>But how were they supposed to search him out in this chaos of people?</p><p>Being a natural tracker, Danyon\u2019s first instinct was to use his sense of smell to find Banjo. He didn\u2019t have a direct link to his scent, like a jacket or shirt, but he wasn\u2019t too concerned about it. A vampire gave off an acrid odor that he could usually smell a mile away. The same held true with a drug addict. Even if they had just stepped out of a shower, their bodies emitted a chemical scent, similar to gasoline. Since Banjo was both vamp and addict that narrowed his scent range considerably. But it still didn\u2019t make it easy.</p><p>Everyone walking the streets carried their own scent. Mix that with spilled alcohol, a little blood, piss and vomit, and the combined odors overwhelmed his sense of smell. It had made his nostrils flare, then constrict\u2014flare, then constrict, as if they were confused and trying to sort and decipher the smells, so they could be placed in appropriate categories. It hadn\u2019t taken long for them to give up and roll all of the odors into one huge ball and label it \u201csour.\u201d Now, no matter which way he turned, hoping that a different wind direction might disintegrate that ball, it was all he smelled.</p><p>Shauna suddenly tugged on his left arm to get his attention, then pointed to a lamp post on the opposite side of the street.</p><p>\u201cI know her,\u201d she yelled over the music blaring behind them. \u201cShe might know where we can find Banjo.\u201d</p><p>Still holding on to his arm, she took off for the other side of the street.</p><p>Danyon didn\u2019t know which woman Shauna was talking about. There were hundreds strolling Bourbon Street and at least a dozen clustered around that lamp post. Shauna seemed confident in her direction, though, so he just kept his mouth shut and followed.</p><p>He was a little surprised when she finally walked up to a large creole woman. The woman was dressed in leopard print tights and a bright orange dress or blouse\u2014 Danyon couldn\u2019t tell the difference. But he didn\u2019t have to be a clothes designer to know that if the woman raised her arms, she\u2019d flash the entire state. Topping off her ensemble was a wide, gold lam\u00e9 belt that she had cinched around her very thick waist. She had an arm wrapped around a tall, well-dressed, black man, who was looking down at her with unabashed pride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman broke into a huge smile the moment she spotted Shauna.</p><p>\u201cGirl, whatchu doin\u2019 here?\u201d the woman asked. She disconnected herself from the man and planted both hands on her hips. \u201cSince when you be out partyin\u2019 like\u2014? Whoa, uh-uh, hol\u2019 up...girl, who that good lookin\u2019 hunk you got wit\u2019 you? That\u2019s your man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Danyon Stone. Danyon, this is Lurnell Franklin. She\u2019s a regular at the shop,\u201d Shauna explained.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s right. I is a reg\u2019lar. I goes there all the time, sugah. See her? That\u2019s my people right there, that be my girl.\u201d She waggled her head at Shauna. \u201cNow what be up wit\u2019 you? All the time I go down to the shop, and you never even told me nothin\u2019 \u2019bout no Mr. Hunky. Where you been hidin\u2019 him, girl?\u201d Lurnell\u2019s eyes suddenly widened. \u201cHol\u2019 up. Looka here...\u201d</p><p>Lurnell turned, grabbed the arm of the man she\u2019d been standing next to, and pulled him up alongside her. \u201cSee here? This be my man, Tyree Johnson.\u201d She leaned closer to Shauna. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sure is. You might want to hang on to this one.\u201d</p><p>Lurnell snapped her fingers. \u201cGirl, that ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 but a thing. I gots that man on lock.\u201d Grinning, she straightened and tugged on Tyree\u2019s arm. \u201cLook here, Tyree, this be my girl, Shauna, from down to the shop on Royal, and that be her man, Darrin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDan-yon,\u201d Shauna said louder, enunciating his name.</p> <p>Lurnell\u2019s brow wrinkled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong wit\u2019 you? You los\u2019 you hearin? That\u2019s what I said\u2014Darrin.\u201d</p><p>Shauna glanced over at Danyon and winked. Then she turned back to Lurnell. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for Banjo. Have you seen him around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatchu want with shrimp bait?\u201d</p><p>Shauna shrugged, as though it really didn\u2019t matter to her if they found him or not. \u201cJust want to talk to him about coming into the shop all drugged up, like he was the last time he came in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat boy went down to you shop waxed?\u201d Lurnell asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see nothin\u2019. Where I was at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were on the phone, remember?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh...yeah,\u201d Lurnell said, then grinned up at Tyree. \u201cI was on the flip talkin\u2019 to you, baby.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and rested a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Lurnell shivered hard, like a dog shaking off rain water. \u201cLawd, look at you givin\u2019 me the want-tos like that.\u201d She fanned her face with a hand and refocused on Shauna. \u201cSo what shrimp bait do to your store? Mess it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. Freaked a few customers out, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat little, scrawny motha f\u2014\u201d Lurnell slapped a hand over her mouth, then dropped it and said to Danyon, \u201cYou gots to \u2019scuse me, Darrin. Sometimes I get a bad case of potty mouth when I has too much to drink. Know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Danyon grinned. The woman was loud and brassy, but he couldn\u2019t help but like her. \u201cNo problem,\u201d he said. \u201cSo have you seen him? Banjo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell no. With all the people trashin\u2019 \u2019round here, that piece of shrimp bait could of run up my damn nose, and I wouldn\u2019t have knowed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea where we can find him?\u201d Danyon asked.</p> <p>Lurnell blew out a raspberry. \u201cPiss-ants like him they stay over to the weird-ass bars down to the other end over there. They got Under the Stairs\u2014that be on the other end of Bourbon, then they got a place called Rush. That one\u2019s a couple more blocks down the same side of Bourbon. If shrimp bait ain\u2019t in neither one of them, then he probably be stuffin\u2019 his beak wit\u2019 batter, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? Either that or the po-po done got him.\u201d</p><p>Danyon leaned over to make sure Shauna heard him. \u201cBatter? Po-po?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocaine,\u201d Shauna explained. \u201cAnd po-po means the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, uh-uh,\u201d Lurnell exclaimed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what batter and the po-po is? Don\u2019t tell me somebody pretty like you is slow on the uptake, huh?\u201d</p><p>Shauna intercepted quickly, cocking a finger at her. \u201cGirl, he\u2019s not slow on nothin\u2019, you hear what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you right!\u201d Lurnell said, with a huge grin and slapped her hands together.</p><p>The two women laughed, and Danyon had to smile at how easy it had been for Shauna to fall into rhythm with Lurnell\u2019s street talk.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Lurnell said. \u201cWe goin\u2019 down to the Cat\u2019s \u2019cause I got to do me some karaokin\u2019. Y\u2019all wanna\u2014what the hell...?\u201d She suddenly stood at attention on tiptoe, gawking at something over Shauna\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damn. Looka that sumabitch.\u201d</p><p>Danyon and Shauna turned and looked in the direction she indicated. All Danyon saw was a sea of people.</p><p>Shauna evidently caught sight of what Lurnell was talking about, because she glanced back and shouted over the crowd noise, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him out at any of these things. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, me neither. But that dog sure steppin\u2019 out to night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d Danyon asked Shauna.</p><p>She took him by the arm and pointed straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cSee the man in the purple shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the woman to his right dressed all in red?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook between them and to the right a little. See the big guy standing a few feet in front of them, the one in the white shirt? He\u2019s got a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heavyset guy with the boa constrictor hanging around his neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavyset?\u201d Lurnell said. \u201cThat man be dressin\u2019 four-fifty on the hoof for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Shauna said to Danyon. \u201cThat\u2019s Papa Gris Gris. He owns the voodoo shop next to Sistah\u2019s, which is Lurnell\u2019s store. They\u2019ve been competitors for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea what would make him come out tonight?\u201d Shauna asked Lurnell, who was now standing beside her.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, I got a idea. Look at that skank rubbin\u2019 up against him.\u201d</p><p>Next to the man Shauna had identified as Papa Gris Gris, Danyon saw a very skinny younger woman rubbing her nearly exposed breasts across the fat man\u2019s left arm.</p><p>Shauna must have spotted her, as well, because she asked, \u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, that be Trish I-gots-the-crabs Deveraux. She work down to the Hustle Club, and that skank be heavy on the batter. She out there doin\u2019 the nasty wit\u2019 Gris Gris \u2019cause he gots some blow, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean he deals cocaine?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cThere be only one reason why she\u2019d be be hangin\u2019 on that fat man. He either got the blow or the dough. She tryflin\u2019, that\u2019s what she be doin\u2019. Now that\u2019s said, yeah. She already don\u2019t got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.\u201d</p><p>It was easy to see that the woman was putting the moves on Gris Gris, and that all four hundred plus pounds of him thoroughly enjoyed it. She was playing the tease, and he had jumped into the game with both feet.</p><p>Danyon turned away. He needed to get out of here. Not that any place else would be any less crowded, but at least moving would help circulate the air around him. They needed to move on with the night and find Banjo.</p><p>He inched forward through the crowd with Shauna still holding on to his arm and glanced back over his shoulder just long enough to say, \u201cNice meeting you Lurnell\u2014Tyree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you, too, baby. When you down to Rampart Street, you come to Sistah\u2019s and see me. I\u2019m gonna give you a good discount to whatever be up in my store.\u201d</p><p>Danyon gave her an obligatory thank-you, waved, then pushed ahead through the crowd. Shauna was evidently still watching Gris Gris because her head was still turned in that direction and she hadn\u2019t said goodbye to Lurnell.</p><p>Inching ahead, he detoured around a guy in a clown suit and was about to detour left, when Shauna suddenly dug her fingernails into his arm.</p><p>Something in the way she gripped him told Danyon that it had nothing to do with controlling the direction he was heading or stopping him.</p><p>It felt more like a reflex, and judging by the look on her face, what prompted it was fear.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>\u201cDigging your way to China with those nails?\u201d Danyon asked, patting Shauna\u2019s hand.</p><p>She threw a quick glance his way. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He motioned to her hand on his arm.</p><p>\u201cOh...sorry.\u201d She released the pressure, but didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized how tightly she had been gripping him because her complete attention had been on Papa Gris Gris and Trish.</p><p>Not long after Lurnell had pointed them out, Shauna found herself being slowly sucked into a weird sound tunnel, something she had never experienced before. It happened gradually at first. So gradually she didn\u2019t notice.</p><p>She remembered asking Lurnell if Gris Gris was a cocaine dealer, but not much more after that. For some odd reason, she became fixated on Gris Gris and Trish\u2019s mouths, watching them move whenever they spoke. Before long, she started to pick up a word or two that fell in sync with the movement of their lips. When that happened, Shauna took notice of what had changed and was changing around her.</p><p>The jumble of faces that belonged to the mass of people crushing them from all sides had grown blurry, while Gris Gris and Trish remained sharp in her line of sight. The noise that had reached inhuman levels had lessened a little in volume. It was still earsplitting to her, but it had dropped enough so that if she turned just so, she was able to hear a few more words.</p><p>And what little she had picked up so far was scaring the hell out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re not sure?\u201d</p><p>Shauna hitched a thumb in Gris Gris\u2019 direction. \u201cSee the man and woman Lurnell was talking about a little while ago?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNasty snake man and Trish? Yeah. What about them?\u201d</p><p>She peered up at Danyon, praying he wouldn\u2019t think she was crazy. \u201cCan you...uh...can you hear anything they\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear them? There\u2019s so much noise out here, I can hardly hear you. Wait...don\u2019t tell me you can hear what those two are saying from here. Over all this noise?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, lookee here, Joe, I found us \u2019nother one!\u201d A short, skinny, drunk guy, wearing a camouflage T-shirt with GET \u2019ER DONE! stenciled across the front, suddenly stepped up to Shauna. Even in the glow of the street lights, she could see the red spider veins that covered his cheeks and the end of his bulbous nose.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Shauna said, and peered over his left shoulder. She didn\u2019t want whatever sound connection she had picked up with Gris Gris and Trish to get lost.</p><p>The drunk laughed until he nearly fell backwards, then he held a fistful of Mardi Gras beads up to her face. \u201cHey, you, purty lady\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to move on, friend,\u201d Danyon said to him.</p> <p>With his timing off a few beats, the drunk looked over and up at Danyon. \u201cDamn, you a big boy, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>Danyon glowered at him. \u201cI said you need to go.\u201d</p><p>The drunk\u2019s brain was either two Gherkins over-pickled or he was just plain stupid, because he turned back to Shauna and dangled the beads in her face again.</p><p>\u201cHey, you, purty lady. You want you some of these here Murdi Gass beads? \u2019Cause you can have \u2019em if ya show me them there purty little boobies of yours.\u201d</p><p>Before she had a chance to respond, Danyon grabbed the guy by the scruff of the neck and literally yanked him up off his feet. He jerked the guy up close, nearly nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cI want you to apologize to the lady for what you said,\u201d Danyon said.</p> <p>The drunk blinked, looked around, obviously confused. \u201cWhere\u2019s Joe?\u201d</p><p>Danyon shook the little man, and the guy appeared to suddenly wake up. Fear widened his eyes.</p><p>Shauna saw the muscles in Danyon\u2019s arm begin to ripple. She reached out to him. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Not breaking eye contact with the drunk, Danyon said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not okay.\u201d He gave the guy another little shake. \u201cIs it, buddy? Now apologize to the lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the drunk cried. \u201cSorry, sorry, sorryer\u2019n I can be!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanyon...\u201d Shauna touched his arm. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His jaw muscles tightened, then relaxed. Then he opened his hand and let the drunk drop to the ground. The guy landed on all fours, and he stayed that way, scrambling away like a crab.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Shauna said. \u201cYou could have really hurt that guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s lucky I didn\u2019t kill him for talking to you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just drunk. I could\u2019ve handled him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if he was drunk. I\u2019m not going to have anybody disrespect you that way, especially when I\u2019m around.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly remembering Gris Gris and Trish, Shauna stood on tiptoe and scanned the crowds until she spotted them again. The weird sound tunnel that had connected her to them earlier was no longer there. All she heard was street noise.</p><p>Shauna squinted and was about to concentrate on Gris Gris and Trish\u2019s mouth like she had before, when she felt Danyon\u2019s hand on her shoulder and his breath against her left cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou never got a chance to answer my question,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you really hear those two over all this noise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now? No. But earlier...I don\u2019t know if it had something to do with the direction of the wind and where I was standing, but...\u201d She peered up at him. \u201cYes, I heard a little of what they were saying.\u201d</p><p>Danyon arched a brow, evidently impressed. Then he looked in Gris Gris and Trish\u2019s direction, cocked his head, and squinted as though to get a bead on their voices. Shauna found it curious that he did the very same thing she did whenever she wanted to identify a particular sound or find its origin. She couldn\u2019t help but wonder if he too experienced the emotional pleasures and pain that came from acute hearing.</p><p>Shauna had discovered young that most sound carried an emotion to the listener in some form or fashion. Fear\u2014curiosity\u2014comfort\u2014heartache\u2014joy\u2014relief\u2014panic.</p><p>Being a kid with overactive myringi and living in a never silent world, she\u2019d had a hard time figuring out what to do with the constant influx of sound and emotion. Each seemed to beg so many questions. Should she keep this emotion that came with that sound? Or should she shelve it? Was there something to learn from that sound or this emotion? Or should she sweep it under a rug and hope she\u2019d never have to hear it and feel it again? Was that sound and that emotion supposed to spur her to action? Or was it calling for inaction and silence?</p><p>As she grew older, Shauna learned that the noise of the fast paced world in which she lived often evoked more negative emotions than positive ones. She had discovered ways to temper the onslaught, but still, even now, it wasn\u2019t always easy to keep them balanced. More times than not, she had to search for the sounds that gave her peace and comfort. Like a soft giggle hidden behind the hand of a small, shy child\u2014the gentle purring from a contented cat as it threaded its way around her legs\u2014the sound of a breeze heading her way to cool the heat of the day. Whenever she found these treasures, she stored them in memory and pulled them out whenever the bad became too much to handle, which seemed to be too often. Sounds like\u2014the last, ragged breath of the dying\u2014the crunch of metal and the snap of bones that came from a car accident too far away to be seen\u2014the cry of a heartache muffled in a pillow by someone who had been taught that the strong don\u2019t cry\u2014the whimper of a sick child too pained to move\u2014the keening of a dying, mourning wolven.</p><p>\u201cHearing anything?\u201d Shauna asked Danyon.</p><p>He shook his head hesitantly. \u201cMaybe a word or two, but I can\u2019t really tell for sure if it\u2019s coming from them. With all this noise, the couple of words I think I\u2019m picking up are garbled and don\u2019t make sense. As far as I can tell, it\u2019s just a fat guy being hit on by a junkie who\u2019s looking for either money or a fix. I don\u2019t get why that\u2019s such a big deal. What am I missing?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, a pot-bellied man wearing an oversized diaper fastened at the hips with ridiculously large safety pins stumbled by. He was sucking on a huge pacifier when he bumped into Danyon. The pacifier popped out of his mouth and hit the street. \u201cS\u2019cuse me,\u201d he said, and a plume of whiskey and onion breath hit Shauna full in the face. She gagged and quickly turned her head away. The guy leaned over to pick up the pacifier and stumbled sideways. The dozen or more Mardi Gras beads he had hanging around his neck slapped against his hairy chest.</p><p>Shauna gave Danyon a \u201ctake it easy on this one, will you?\u201d look.</p><p>He responded with a half-smile, then helped the guy stand upright. \u201cCareful, buddy.\u201d</p><p>After sending the drunk on his way, he asked Shauna, \u201cHas your hearing always been that sensitive?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cEver since I can remember.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment, and Shauna saw wonder in his eyes. She looked away, suddenly embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. More a pain in the rear than anything. You should try being in the Superdome during a Saints\u2019 football game with ears like mine. All those people cheering and screaming...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you make out what snake man and his girlfriend are saying now?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>Shauna turned toward Gris Gris and Trish. Since she didn\u2019t know how the sound tunnel was formed the first time, she didn\u2019t know how to recreate it. So, she did what she always did when zeroing in on a sound\u2014Shauna tilted her head, squinted, and concentrated. She watched the movement of their mouths.</p><p>Trish Deveraux\u2019s voice came through almost immediately, but, as before, her words were choppy, disjointed.</p><p>\u201c\u2014give you\u2014money. I...it, honey.\u201d</p><p>Trish rubbed up against Gris Gris provocatively. It didn\u2019t take someone with great hearing to know she was hitting on the man.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>\u201cSounds like a drug deal\u2019s going down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no surprise. Lurnell told us she was a user. We really don\u2019t have time to bother with those two right now, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but Gris Gris is talking about some weird stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe so, but from what you said about Banjo, how he acted in the shop, smelling the cookies from across the street, then the whole thing with Mattie\u2014I think he\u2019s our best lead so far. Let\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Shauna held up a hand. \u201cWait. Gris Gris just said... \u2018Gonna make you feel\u2014you God\u2014makes you God\u2014it does\u2014ain\u2019t got\u2014but I can.\u2019 Now Trish is saying, \u2018Gotta have...bad.\u2019 Gris Gris again\u2014he\u2019s saying, \u2018Thousand dollars\u2014ounce\u2014clean\u2014pure\u2014fresh ground.\u2019 Now Trish is saying, \u2018Ain\u2019t got thousand\u2014give blow\u2014for it.\u2019 Okay, Gris Gris again, \u2018Only me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Then their conversation was interrupted by a couple who stopped to coo over the snake. She saw Trish begin to fidget, pace, evidently agitated that the couple had stolen Gris Gris\u2019 attention.</p><p>Oddly enough, Shauna heard the couple talking about the snake so clearly, they might as well have been standing two feet away. The woman was doing most of the talking. Her accent had a twangy, southern lilt to it, very different from the Creole and Cajun accents from south Louisiana.</p><p>\u201cI swear, I ain\u2019t never seen a snake that big,\u201d the woman said. \u201cBack home, in Valdosta, my PawPaw always taught me not to touch snakes \u2019cause you never know which of \u2019em is poisonous and which of \u2019ems not. And you know, back home in Valdosta, we have these here kinda snakes we call egg-suckers. They ain\u2019t big like your snake, but they\u2019ll crawl right on up the fence of the coop and help themselves. They take them baby chick eggs right out from under the mama chicken. She can peck \u2019im and peck \u2019im and squawk \u2019til the cows come home, but that don\u2019t bother that ol\u2019 snake none. Can I touch your snake?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Although Shauna didn\u2019t hear Gris Gris\u2019 response, he must have given the woman permission because she reached out and poked the boa with the tip of a finger.</p><p>\u201cOh, my, she\u2019s dry,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI heard snakes was slimy and all, but I never held one before so I didn\u2019t know for sure. I think she\u2019s pretty, though.\u201d</p><p>The man standing near the woman, took her by the arm and was urging her to get moving.</p> <p>\u201cOh, okay, then\u2014well, bye-bye now,\u201d the woman said to Gris Gris. \u201cThank you for lettin\u2019 us look at your snake.\u201d</p><p>No sooner did the couple walk away, than Trish glued herself back to Gris Gris\u2019 side. She saw Trish slide a hand over the big man\u2019s belly, all the way down to his groin. A sneer crossed Gris Gris\u2019 face. Shauna didn\u2019t know what made her more nauseous, seeing that or the guy with the whiskey-onion breath. Then Trish stepped in front of Gris Gris, and from the way she moved, it was a sure bet that she was rubbing her breasts against the man\u2019s chest.</p><p>Shauna shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t hear anything now. Not with Trish in front of him like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about them,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cTo be honest, what you said they were talking about didn\u2019t sound that weird to me. I think you\u2019re right about it being a drug deal, but they could be talking about anything, heroin\u2014cocaine\u2014meth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA thousand dollars an ounce?\u201d</p> <p>He shrugged. \u201cLike I said, I don\u2019t know. They could have been talking about more than one thing, and you might have picked the words up out of sequence. I mean really, Shauna. Take a good look at the guy. He\u2019s so big he probably loses his breath just crossing the street. Can you really picture him trying to hold down a were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...but I think he knows something\u2014they both know something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re pulling at straws.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll keep everything you\u2019ve said in mind, but humor me for now, will you? Let\u2019s find Banjo first. I think he\u2019s a more solid lead, and we need to follow through with it. It\u2019s not going to get any easier with this crowd. The later it gets the more crowded it\u2019ll become. And crazier. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to find Banjo in this mass of people as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but I want to stay here for a few more minutes. Maybe we\u2019ll hear more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re wasting time. Look, Rush is only two or three blocks from here, and according to Lurnell, it\u2019s one of Banjo\u2019s regular hangouts. So we\u2019ll start there.\u201d He turned, ready to leave.</p><p>Shauna tugged on his arm. \u201cWait. What if we move a little closer to Gris Gris and Trish? We\u2019ll hear more if we\u2019re closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go over there,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cNot with all these people. To get anywhere out here, you have to flow with the foot traffic, not against it. We\u2019ll get to them next if we need to, but I really don\u2019t think Gris Gris makes a solid candidate. Besides, if he was dealing some new drug, or any drugs at all, don\u2019t you think Lurnell would know since her store isn\u2019t far from his?\u201d</p><p>Shauna wanted to argue back, to plead her case. Something in her gut was telling her to pay attention to what Gris Gris had to say. But Danyon was already in motion, his mind evidently made up that they had to get to Banjo first.</p><p>With little choice but to follow, Shauna squeezed through the crowds after him. She had a sneaking suspicion that Gris Gris was somehow involved with the were deaths, and she planned to find out why, how, and with whom.</p><p>And she\u2019d do it with or without Danyon\u2019s help.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Shauna wound up clinging to the back of Danyon\u2019s shirt as they made their way down Bourbon. He had been right about the crowd getting worse as it got later. Even now, they weren\u2019t able to walk side by side, so she had to trail behind him.</p> <p>From the safety of Danyon\u2019s height and width, she saw men and women hanging off of balconies on the second floors of restaurants and bars, most of them dangling Mardi Gras beads of different shapes and colors over the railing, offering them as prizes to anyone on the street below brave enough to show a little skin. The alcohol flowed, breasts were bared, pants were yanked down, offering a full moon view to whoever had the biggest, brightest beads. Some people were dressed in costumes that ranged from cartoon characters to horror movie headliners like Freddy Kruger, Jason in the infamous hockey mask and, of course, Leatherface, only this one carried a plastic chainsaw. Some were dressed in street clothes, others barely wore clothes at all. Many wore Mardi Gras masks that were decorated with purple plumage and sprinkled with green and gold glitter.</p><p>To many people, New Orleans was the party capital of the world. They loved coming to the city because they knew she would open her arms wide, no matter their race, sexual preference, or political beliefs. Most of the tourists who came for Nuit du Dommage and Mardi Gras loved wearing the costumes and masks because it gave them an outlet to shed their inhibitions and do things they normally wouldn\u2019t do. Shauna saw the city in a slightly different light. To her, New Orleans was a safe haven\u2014a mother, a lover, a friend, one who would accept you without judgment when you removed the mask you wore in everyday life. People love New Orleans for different reasons, and although she welcomes all who come to her door, there are only a few that she truly loves back. Shauna could always spot those fortunate people. They were the ones who saw beyond the booze and glitz and free-for-alls. They truly got her.</p><p>It seemed to be taking forever for them to cover the two blocks needed to reach the Rush club. They had been inching along so slowly, that it took Shauna a few minutes to realize they had come to a dead stop.</p><p>She tugged on Danyon\u2019s shirt, and he leaned toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did we stop?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBest I can tell, the police are breaking up a fight up ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cWe\u2019re not making any progress. Let\u2019s go back to where Gris Gris and Trish were. I just know there\u2019s something going on there.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019ll be even more difficult going back than it is going forward. And we can\u2019t be everywhere at once. Besides, you only heard bits and pieces of their conversation. If we took that trail instead of the one we\u2019re on with Banjo, we might be led down a never ending rabbit hole. You heard Banjo clearly. You said he talked about no teeth and no big fingernails\u2014I want to start where I think we\u2019ll have a decent shot of at least getting more information. We can get to the snake man later. He\u2019s not going anywhere. A four-hundred pound man who uses a boa constrictor as an accessory can\u2019t have that many places to hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but\u2014Hey...that\u2019s him! There he is!\u201d</p><p>Danyon snapped to attention. \u201cWho? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanjo. Over there in the orange shirt!\u201d She pointed ahead and to the right. It was by chance she had caught sight of him. Out the corner of her eye, she had spotted something orange popping in and out of view. It caught her attention long enough for her to see that it was a person with a pointed head and long, greasy, brown hair and was wearing a bright orange shirt. The person appeared to be jumping up and down, like they were spring-loaded, and it wasn\u2019t until the person turned slightly that she saw Banjo\u2019s face just as he jumped on the upswing.</p><p>A couple of seconds after she pointed him out to Danyon, Banjo was no longer jumping in and out of view. Fearing he had spotted her, as well, Shauna pushed aggressively through the crowd, trying to reach the spot where she had seen him. But the more she pushed and shoved, the tighter the crowds wrapped around her.</p><p>\u201cI think we lost him,\u201d Shauna shouted to Danyon.</p><p>\u201cNo, we didn\u2019t,\u201d he said, then grabbed her hand and forged ahead. \u201cI saw him run into Opal\u2019s bar.\u201d</p><p>Shauna soon found herself trotting to keep up with Danyon. He didn\u2019t have to push anyone out of the way. People saw him charging ahead, and they simply parted to make way.</p><p>In a matter of minutes, Danyon veered left, still pulling her along, then crossed the open doorway into Opal\u2019s.</p><p>Like any other bar on Bourbon on a busy night, Opal\u2019s was dark, save for the neon beer sign over the bar and a couple of blue and red spotlights that showcased a blues band playing in one corner. The small joint smelled of booze, sweat and cigarette smoke, and was as packed as the street outside. The loud thump of music, glasses clinking, people laughing and talking, the noise was almost more than Shauna could bear.</p><p>Still holding her hand in a vice grip, Danyon led her to the long stretch of bar on the left.</p><p>The bartender was a short, sweaty man wearing a bad hairpiece. He was running from one end of the bar to the other, replacing empty beer bottles with fresh cold ones and pouring shots of bourbon, vodka, and tequila. Danyon signaled him over.</p><p>\u201cGet to ya when I get to ya, Bubba,\u201d the bartender said as he rushed past Danyon to deliver a drink to a woman sitting at the other end of the bar. As he raced back in the opposite direction, Danyon leaned over the bar, grabbed him by the shirt tail and pulled him up close.</p><p>\u201cHey, man! Get your hands off me. What the hell you...\u201d It was about this time that the bartender appeared to get a really good look at who he was talking to and the size of the hand that held on to him. \u201cYeah, okay, whatever. What you gonna have, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cHave you seen a guy running through here? Bright orange shirt, long hair, skinny?\u201d</p><p>The bartender shook his head. \u201cDude, you\u2019re talking about half the drunks in the city right now.\u201d</p><p>Danyon pulled him up a bit closer. \u201cDo I look like a dude to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...no. No, man, no. I\u2019m just saying. Shit, I\u2019m just doing my job. There\u2019re so many people in and out of here, everybody starts looking the same after a while. I don\u2019t know if the guy you\u2019re looking for has even been in here. Look, help yourself\u2014look around the joint if you want. Maybe he\u2019s out back or something. You a cop are what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr what,\u201d Danyon said, then pointed to an open door on the other side of the bar. \u201cWhat\u2019s back there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom, storage space, that\u2019s it. Hey, uh...you mind letting go of my shirt?\u201d</p><p>Danyon gave him a hard look before releasing his hold on him. \u201cGot a back door?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaw, man it\u2019s an old building. No place for a back-door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if a fire starts in here?\u201d Shauna asked. \u201cHow do people get out?\u201d</p><p>The bartender shrugged. \u201cSome do, some don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>While Danyon and the bartender continued their little \u201ctete-a-tete,\u201d Shauna glanced about, searching through the crowd for Banjo. A flash of orange suddenly darted in front of the bandstand, then it wiggled through the crowd and slipped between the wall and the door jam, like a cockroach running for cover under a baseboard.</p><p>\u201cOver there!\u201d Shauna shouted, then pulled out of Danyon\u2019s grip and took off after Banjo. Fortunately, Danyon didn\u2019t waste time by stopping her to ask for clarification. Within seconds, he was beside her and forcing a path through the throng of people.</p> <p>As soon as they got outside, Danyon asked, \u201cWhich way?\u201d</p><p>Shauna looked from left to right. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I saw him slip out the door on the left, so...maybe this way?\u201d She pointed left.</p><p>\u201cNo, right there!\u201d Danyon grabbed her hand again and took off running.</p><p>Before Shauna knew it, they were barreling into \u201cBarely, Barely, Barely,\u201d one of the many strip clubs on Bourbon that redefined the term, \u201cadult entertainment.\u201d</p><p>The place was much bigger than Opal\u2019s, with three circular stages in the main room. A metal pole rose from the center of each stage, and attached to each pole was a gyrating woman wearing nothing but a glittering G-string and stilettos. Shauna was surprised that she wasn\u2019t undone with embarrassment, especially with Danyon beside her. She couldn\u2019t help but watch the women, fascinated by how effortlessly they stretched, climbed and wrapped their bodies around the poles.</p><p>As the woman in the middle finished her routine, she slid down her pole, slowly winding her body around it as she lowered herself. When her stilettos hit the platform, Shauna spotted Banjo on the opposite side of her stage. His body was pressed against it, and his arms were spread out wide. It took a second or two for Shauna to realize that Banjo was dry humping the stage.</p> <p>Taking advantage of Banjo\u2019s preoccupation, Shauna tapped Danyon on the arm and pointed him out as inconspicuously as possible. She felt his body tense, as though ready to spring into action. She signaled for Danyon to lower his head so she wouldn\u2019t have to yell to be heard and possibly risk alerting Banjo again.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to sneak up on him,\u201d Shauna said, when he lowered an ear to her. \u201cIf we try to charge him, he\u2019ll see us and take off again for sure. You stay here in case he goes for the front door. I\u2019m going to slip around the stages and see if I can come up from behind him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trap that wild thing from the back, and you\u2019re going to have a hell of a fight on your hands,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cI\u2019ll get behind him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cYou\u2019re too tall. He\u2019ll be able to see you coming from a mile away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re short?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m shorter than you.\u201d</p><p>With that, Shauna made her way stoop-shouldered through the male dominated crowd, then took her time going around the stages until she was directly behind the center platform. Banjo was still preoccupied, evidently determined to impregnate the stage.</p><p>The crowd that stood between him and Shauna was at least four rows deep. She sneaked past the back two rows without anyone taking notice, then braved the third. Most of the men in the place appeared singularly focused, their eyes locked on the swaying breasts and gyrating hips. No one paid any attention to her, and she wanted it to stay that way. She continued to inch forward, keeping an eye on Banjo. The last thing she wanted was to lose sight of him again. She didn\u2019t even bother looking for Danyon to make certain he was standing guard at the door in case Banjo bolted. She simply trusted that he was where he needed to be.</p> <p>By the time Shauna reached the last row of men, the one closest to the stage and the only obstacle left between her and Banjo, she was holding her breath.</p><p>So close now...</p><p>All she had to do was duck around the last row of men, and she would be home free. She was determined to get hold of Banjo, even if it meant taking him down with a flying tackle. But she had to get close enough to him to make that happen.</p><p>She turned sideways and gently pushed past two men who stood gaping at the live version of what had probably been their greatest sexual fantasy since puberty. Her right foot had barely touched the open space between the stage and those men, when she heard the whistling and catcalls begin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, girl! Go on up there and show them how to work it!\u201d</p><p>The place erupted with whooping and hollering, cheering and clapping.</p><p>\u201cTake them clothes off, girly!\u201d</p><p>Worrying that Danyon had heard that last request and might come storming through, looking for blood, Shauna shot through the last row of men and took off for Banjo.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t two feet past the starting line, when Banjo spun around, spotted her, and bolted for the front door of the club. Shauna ran after him and saw Danyon standing in the doorway like a linebacker, arms outstretched and ready to catch the slippery little worm.</p><p>Banjo evidently noticed Danyon, as well, because he darted left, then right, then left again, like he was trying to come up with an escape strategy.</p><p>Shauna raced past the first two dance platforms and the cat calls grew louder. The noise sent Banjo whirling about, and when he saw how close she was, he began to serpentine right, then left, circling, circling. She heard him laugh, that horrible, twittering sound that hammered on her nerves, and gritted her teeth.</p><p>Still laughing, Banjo darted hard to the left, then dove into the crowd that had gathered to watch.</p><p>Fearing they might lose him, Shauna raised a hand over her head and signaled Danyon to Banjo\u2019s location. Obviously understanding what she meant, Danyon sprinted in the direction she had indicated. Seconds later, when Shauna came to a stumbling stop beside Danyon\u2014 Banjo was no longer in sight.</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Danyon said, incredulously. \u201cWhere in the hell did he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver there!\u201d a man standing in the doorway shouted. He pointed outside and to the left.</p><p>\u201cThere! He ran that way!\u201d a handful of men yelled, all of them pointing in the same direction as the man before them. They were obviously anxious to see this ordeal through to its conclusion.</p><p>When Shauna and Danyon reached the street, a tall guy wearing a new Orleans Saints\u2019 ball cap and a Dallas Cowboys jersey was standing on the sidewalk, pointing and yelling. \u201cHe ran inside the Lightning! Over in the Lightning!\u201d</p><p>Puzzled, because she didn\u2019t know of any bar or restaurant in the area with that name, Shauna shouted over at the guy in the ball cap. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Lightning?\u201d</p><p>The man raised both hands over his head and pointed adamantly to his left. \u201cThere\u2014there!\u201d</p><p>Concerned that she might be dealing with another drunk who didn\u2019t know his rear end from a hole in the ground, Shauna scanned the street as best she could with so many people in the way, to see if any of the blinking, multi-colored business signs on either side of Bourbon read Lightning. As far as she could tell, none did.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d Danyon suddenly shouted, then grabbed Shauna by the hand and pulled her along as he pushed forward.</p><p>Half a block down, he pointed to a small swinging sign that hung over the threshold of a narrow entryway. The sign read, UNDER the STAIRS, and the logo beside it was a yellow lightning bolt. As soon as Shauna read it, she recognized the name. It was one of the dives Lurnell had told them that Banjo frequented. Shauna let go of Danyon\u2019s hand and quickly took the lead through the entryway.</p><p>Immediately upon entering, she was surprised to find a short flight of stairs instead of the main room of the bar. With Danyon following close behind, she took the stairs two at a time only to find herself in a narrow hallway once she reached the top. The walls were black and splattered with orange, green, red and blue neon paint that came to life under a black light. At the end of the hall was another set of stairs, which led them to a narrow landing, then another set of stairs, and yet another landing.</p><p>\u201cThis is like a maze from a horror movie,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>The last hallway ended at the top of a longer flight of stairs. Shauna went down first, following the stairway down, down, down. The maze of stairways and landings, then the final set of stairs heading down, had been built to create the illusion that you were going further below ground than the first floor. Shauna thought that odd, since anyone who lived in, or had been to, New Orleans knew going below ground was impossible, given most of the city was at or below sea level.</p><p>At the bottom of the stairs was the entrance to the club. It was no bigger than Opal\u2019s, but just as dark and dank. The place wasn\u2019t nearly as crowded, though, and the jukebox playing in the corner was at a moderate volume. An Asian couple swayed slowly together beside it, and it looked more like they were holding each other up than dancing. A pool table stood at the back of the room, and a few lopsided wooden tables with accompanying plastic chairs of various colors had been placed haphazardly about the bar. People were clustered into small groups here and there, most of them hidden by shadows.</p><p>\u201cSee any sign of him?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Shauna said through gritted teeth. Anger was rolling its way to fury inside her. How was it possible for that scrawny twerp to keep slipping out from beneath them? A thought suddenly struck her, pitching her anger right past fury to a tsunami of rage.</p><p>What if Banjo had purposely led them on a wild goose chase so real business could be taken care of elsewhere? Had he been sent as a diversion? What in the hell was his connection to this? Shauna wanted to wrap her hands around Banjo\u2019s scrawny neck and choke the answer out of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnybody here see a scrawny guy in an orange shirt run through here?\u201d Shauna asked loudly.</p><p>The answer was the clack of billiard balls being racked and set\u2014the schtack from a pop top\u2014the screech of a chair shifting on a concrete floor. No one else said a word.</p><p>\u201cUnless there\u2019s an exit door we don\u2019t know about,\u201d Shauna said to Danyon, \u201cthere\u2019s no way Banjo could\u2019ve gotten out of here without us seeing him. We would have passed him on the stairs.\u201d</p> <p>Danyon nodded and walked over to the bar. She followed, hoping he had picked up the same feeling she had\u2014that the people in this bar might not take too kindly to their bartender being grabbed by the collar.</p><p>When they reached the bar, Danyon rested an arm on it, then asked the middle-aged guy standing behind it, \u201cYou have a back door here?\u201d The man\u2019s eyes stayed flat as he shook his head. Then he turned his back to Danyon and started rearranging bottles on the shelf by the register.</p><p>\u201cWas that a no?\u201d Danyon pressed.</p><p>The bartender didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Exhausted from being pushed and shoved on the street for hours, tired of not being any closer to answers than when they started, and furious that Banjo had managed to slip past them again, Shauna quick-stepped to the bar before Danyon could stop her, then leaned over it and slapped a hand on the Plexi-glass top.</p> <p>\u201cHe asked you if there was a back door,\u201d she declared. \u201cIf you can\u2019t answer the damn question, I\u2019ll go looking for it myself.\u201d</p><p>The bartender turned and looked at her, and for a moment, Shauna expected him to either burst out laughing or pick up the phone and call the police. Instead, he cocked his head toward the pool table.</p><p>Thinking he may have just given away Banjo\u2019s hiding place, she spun about on her heels.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Banjo.</p><p>It was a huge white man about Danyon\u2019s height, but at least two and a half times his weight. He had an acne scarred face, dark eyes that were too small for his face, and a bald head that not only looked like it was a trans plant from a bulldog, it was covered with tattoos of naked women.</p><p>He stared at Shauna and leaned over the pool table, stick in hand as if preparing to shoot. His thick lips curled into a sneer, that all but said, \u201cYou\u2019re one good lookin\u2019 piece of prime rib, and I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p> <p>The man had to be Big Frank Macina, the leader of the BGW gang that Jagger had told them about, the biker gang that thought they were big and bad enough to take over some Blood and Crip territory.</p><p>She wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it. Macina didn\u2019t look big and bad. He looked like he needed a bath, a dentist, and a hard-hitting weight loss program.</p><p>It suddenly struck Shauna as she stared at his tasteless tattoos\u2014what better way would there be for a new gang to take turf from one of the toughest gangs in the country than to be the sole provider of the most potent drug in the underground market?</p><p>The answer to that was simple.</p><p>None.</p><p>Without giving it a second thought, Shauna stormed toward Big Frank.</p><p>She was a Keeper and was responsible for the safety and well-being of the weres in this city. She was also responsible for helping to keep peace between her weres and every other race living in the city.</p><p>However, there was one race she could not have cared less about maintaining peace with\u2014assholes.</p> <p>In her book, anyone out to harm her weres, directly or indirectly, fit into that category.</p><p>Being a Keeper wasn\u2019t her job. It was her purpose in life. And if that meant tackling a three hundred and fifty pound, tattooed, yeast-colored piece of crap like Macina, then so be it.</p><p>Whatever it took to protect her weres.</p><p>And nothing and no one was going to stop her.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Danyon had one eye on the bartender, wondering if a quick jab and a nose realignment might re-circuit the guy\u2019s attitude and sharpen his memory, when he spotted Shauna heading for the pool table.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he called after her, meaning to get her attention, to stop her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t work.</p><p>He saw that her hands were balled into fists at her side and knew big trouble was on the way.</p><p>Danyon took off after her, intending to steer Shauna toward a quick exit up the stairs, but he was two steps too short. Shauna was already leaning over the pool table, confronting the bull mastiff who was holding a pool stick.</p><p>Earlier, he had been so focused on finding Banjo and keeping Shauna out of trouble, that he hadn\u2019t noticed the tattoos on the big man\u2019s bald head. The entire lumpy sphere was covered with ink drawings of naked women in different poses. Danyon remembered the description Jagger had given them of the leader of the BGW biker gang that had recently come into town. Although there were a lot of people in New Orleans right now for Nuit du Dommage, he seriously doubted he would find more than one man who fit the gang leader\u2019s description. He had no doubt he was about to meet Big Frank Macina.</p><p>Shauna kicked that meeting off with all the grace and charm of a MacDonald ready to take on the world.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your game?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>Danyon stood about six feet behind her, trying to figure out if he should just scoop her up now and get her out of here, or let her get out whatever she had in her system. He also had to consider that she was a Keeper, which meant he needed to respect her space and abilities, instead of jumping at every turn to protect her, the way he had with the drunk on Bourbon earlier. Standing back and just watching was far from easy. His basic nature and instinct wanted to toss Shauna over his shoulder and haul her outside. But who was he kidding? Even if he did haul her out against her will, she would just turn around and head right back in. What concerned Danyon even more, was that he knew even if he wasn\u2019t standing right behind her as backup, Shauna would still be up in Big Frank\u2019s face.</p><p>Frank\u2019s grin was wide and nasty. He tossed the pool stick on the table and laid his big hands palm down on the felt.</p><p>\u201cSay again?\u201d he said to Shauna.</p><p>\u201cI said, what\u2019s your game?\u201d Shauna repeated. The Travis Tritt song that had been playing on the jukebox went silent, and the entire bar fell into an eerie hush.</p><p>Frank glared at Shauna, his eyes unwavering. \u201cI\u2019d say the game\u2019s you, Missy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou run with some skinny chick named Trish and a guy who goes by the name Banjo Marks?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Frank\u2019s grin grew wider, and he stood upright and sauntered over to the corner of the pool table, then leaned a hip against it and folded his tree trunk-size arms across his chest. \u201cWhat\u2019s it to ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimply asking a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I just gave you a simple answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You gave me another question,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>Frank laughed, a deep rumbling sound that had no humor in it at all. \u201cLittle girl, I think it\u2019s past your bedtime. You best be gettin\u2019 home.\u201d</p><p>Danyon flinched. Now why did the guy have to go and call her a little girl?</p><p>As he suspected would happen, Shauna popped to attention, bristling.</p><p>Frank snorted, and his eyes traveled over Shauna\u2019s body, pausing in places that made Danyon want to rip the massive guy\u2019s eyeballs out of their sockets.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing you\u2019re looking at is a little girl,\u201d Shauna declared.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Frank uncrossed his arms, then grabbed his crotch with a hand. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you come on over here and prove just how little you aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Danyon wanted to pounce on the guy and yank his heart out through an ear canal. But he held his ground, allowing Shauna to keep the lead.</p><p>She didn\u2019t disappoint.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to prove jack to you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I\u2019ll let big ol\u2019 Frank here,\u201d he pointed to the thick bulge in the crotch of his jeans, \u201cbe the one to do the provin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She harrumphed.</p><p>Frank folded his arms again, appearing to grow bored. \u201cSo what the hell\u2019s your game? You just bored and out to start some shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you\u2019re the head of some new biker gang,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>That must have pushed Frank\u2019s pride button, because his chest expanded another two inches. \u201cYeah, well, you heard right.\u201d</p><p>Shauna pursed her lips and nodded, and Danyon had a sinking feeling that things were getting ready to go from bad to worse.</p><p>\u201cAnd the name of your gang is BGW?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cSomebody give the lady a stuffed penguin for getting two right in a row,\u201d Frank said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cBetter make it one of those big stuffed bears,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m about to hit you with a third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it,\u201d Frank said, obviously amused now.</p><p>\u201cWord has it that you plan on scarfing some territory from the Bloods and the Crips. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>At the mention of the Blood and the Crips, four men from a nearby table got up and slowly made their way behind Frank, forming a semi-circle.</p><p>\u201cI asked if that was right,\u201d Shauna pressed.</p><p>Frank\u2019s eyes grew hard. \u201cYou one of their bitches?\u201d</p><p>Appearing far from deterred, Shauna glared at each man standing behind Frank, then set her sights back on the big man. \u201cGet real,\u201d she said. \u201cDo I look like I belong to either of those gangs? Quit acting like a punk and call off your goons.\u201d</p><p>One of the guys standing behind Frank took a step toward her.</p><p>Danyon countered it.</p><p>\u201cBack off, Tee,\u201d Frank said to the front man who appeared to be getting a little ahead of the game.</p><p>Tee was about Frank\u2019s size, and he had long brown hair that he kept flipping over his shoulder like a girl.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d been told to stand down, he took his time about it, all the while staring at Shauna.</p><p>Frank leaned toward her. \u201cYou listen close. If you\u2019re looking for information on this \u2018Banjo\u2019 dude, you came to the wrong place. But if you\u2019re looking for trouble, you\u2019ve hit the mother lode,\u201d Frank warned. \u201cThere\u2019s no business in here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a public bar. I have as much right to be here as you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frank rubbed a hand slowly over his bald head.</p><p>Even from where he stood, Danyon felt anger radiating off the guy, like heat from a sunlamp.</p><p>\u201cKnow what else I heard?\u201d Shauna asked, taking a step toward Frank.</p> <p>Frank narrowed his eyes, tucked a thumb in his belt loop.</p><p>\u201cI heard you picked up on some new stuff, and that you plan to push it, use it to take over some B and C turf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just what new stuff did you hear we got?\u201d Frank asked.</p><p>Danyon had no idea what Shauna was talking about. When Jagger had told them about BGW, he didn\u2019t say anything about them bringing drugs into the city. In fact, Jagger had claimed that, so far, the gang had been laying pretty low. Shauna was obviously fishing for some thing.</p><p>Shauna shrugged a response to Frank. \u201cAll I heard was \u2018new.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Frank gave her a crooked smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about. We\u2019re just here for a little Mardi Gras fun.\u201d</p><p>Weighing Frank\u2019s reaction, Danyon couldn\u2019t figure out if the guy knew exactly what Shauna was talking about, or if he was simply determined to fuel her temper.</p><p>If his intention was the latter, it appeared he had accomplished the job...big time.</p><p>\u201cListen up, creep. I really don\u2019t care what gang you lead. For all I know, the whole damn lot of you probably ride Schwinns. And what kind of gang name is BGW any way? What does it stand for? Balloons, gumballs and watermelon? Grow up. You, the Blood, the Crips, all of you strut your stuff like you own the world, but all you bring with you no matter where you go is your dope and a pile of crap. People are dying because of what you put out on the street. I\u2019m going to put a stop to your little boy\u2019s club, even if I have to do it myself!\u201d</p><p>Frank stood up straight, dropped his hands to his side. \u201cBitch, you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about. Your mouth is about to get your face smashed in.\u201d</p><p>Much to Danyon\u2019s dismay, Shauna snapped back, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a big man for you. You\u2019re going to hit a woman? Is that how you\u2019re used to getting your way? Is that your exercise regiment for all that blubber you\u2019re hauling around?\u201d</p> <p>Frank aimed a finger at Shauna but glared at Danyon. \u201cDude, if this is your bitch you\u2019d better grab her ass and get her out of here, before my foot winds up in her face and yours, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who did your tats?\u201d Shauna asked, evidently determined to get herself killed. \u201cSome kindergartener with a green crayon?\u201d</p><p>Frank lowered his head ever so slightly. If looks could kill Shauna would already be at the morgue.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on. Spill it,\u201d Shauna demanded. \u201cBe a man and say what you\u2019ve got. What\u2019s your game? What\u2019s your stuff? What are you going to use to take over that Blood and Crip territory? Your gumballs? Your watermelon? Are you using Banjo to run your junk? Is that what you\u2019re doing? What\u2019s the matter? Your balls aren\u2019t big enough to talk to a woman? You can\u2019t tell it like it is?\u201d Shauna took another step toward him.</p><p>All Frank had to do was lean over a couple inches, stretch out a hand, and he would be able to grab her by the neck and snap it. She was going too far.</p><p>Shauna jabbed a finger in the air, right in front of Frank\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve got people dying out here because of scum like you. And I\u2019m tired of it, you hear? I\u2019m tired of my people always having to watch their backs because of dogs like you. You and the rest of your punks need to get on your tricycles and just get the hell out of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, bitch!\u201d Frank roared. His right hand shot up, then swung out, heading for Shauna\u2019s face.</p><p>In a flash, Danyon sprang forward and grabbed Frank\u2019s arm. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.</p> <p>By now, all of Frank\u2019s goons had circled in tight.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have any idea who you\u2019re messing with,\u201d Frank said to Danyon. His eyes had narrowed into slits, and he bared his teeth.</p><p>\u201cOh, I think it\u2019s the other way around,\u201d Danyon snarled.</p><p>\u201cThat little slut of yours is the one who started all this shit,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>The second Danyon heard the word \u201cslut\u201d fly out of Frank\u2019s mouth, his entire body began to vibrate, and his muscles rippled from his calves to his thighs\u2014from his arms to his chest. He wanted to rip the man\u2019s face off. Rip his heart out of his chest. Even if it meant transforming to were right in front of everyone in the bar.</p><p>Shauna appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, and forced her body between his and Frank\u2019s. He thought he saw her mouth move, but he couldn\u2019t hear any words. The fury inside of him had grown too loud.</p><p>When her voice finally came through, it was panicked. \u201cI just saw him! He\u2019s out back\u2014Banjo!\u201d</p><p>Danyon didn\u2019t know if she was making this up to prevent him from transforming to were, or if she was telling the truth. By the way she kept jabbing a finger toward the stairway, he suspected it might be the latter.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose him again if we don\u2019t go now. I just saw him dart up the stairs. We\u2019ve got to hurry!\u201d She pulled Danyon\u2019s arm, and he allowed her to lead him back to the stairway.</p><p>As they rushed up, two steps at a time, Danyon heard a roar of laughter behind them. He knew the men were laughing at him, because he had been yanked out of the bar by a woman. Under any other circumstances, Danyon would have gone back and changed their tune, possibly slaughtering them all\u2014his fury was that great. But he had an entire pack to take care of. They had to come first. They were always first.</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d Shauna said, as soon as they\u2019d stepped into the street.</p><p>He spotted a flash of orange dart between two buildings about seventy feet away. This time Banjo was not going to slip past him.</p><p>Danyon ran.</p><p>So much tension had built up inside him, that Danyon quickly reached a speed he only acquired when he was were. He wondered if he had transformed without even realizing it.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, he caught up to Banjo, grabbed him around the throat with one hand and wrapped the other hand in his hair. Then he yanked Banjo into a side alley and slammed his back against a brick wall.</p><p>Shauna appeared immediately after and stood at the entrance of the alleyway, which would have been Banjo\u2019s only hope of escape, since the opposite end of the alley was blocked off by a ten-foot brick wall.</p><p>Banjo\u2019s eyes were wide and darting up, down\u2014left and right. Danyon knew he was looking for an escape. Anything, anywhere\u2014if he could scale the walls he would have. His face held nothing but stark fear when he realized he was trapped.</p><p>Banjo laced his fingers together and put hands on top of his head. He started rocking back and forth, then dropped to his knees. \u201cWhaddaya want, man? Whaddaya want? Look, she know me.\u201d He aimed his chin at Shauna. \u201cYou know me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know you all right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were in my shop, telling me secrets, remember? Trading secrets for cookies\u2014does that ring a bell?\u201d</p><p>Banjo rolled his head from shoulder to shoulder and squeezed his eyes shut for a couple seconds. \u201cAww, man, aww, I be takin\u2019 stuff, ya know? Takin\u2019 stuff\u2014I\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d As he jabbered, he got to his feet, lowered his hands, and took a step forward.</p><p>Danyon grabbed him again and threw him back up against the wall. Banjo dropped into a squat and clasped his hands together as though he were praying. \u201cDon\u2019t kill me, okay, man? Please, don\u2019t kill me. I didn\u2019t do nothin\u2019, I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019, I swear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know anything and didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Shauna said, \u201cthen why did you take off running when you saw me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I do that\u2014I just do that.\u201d</p><p>A street light near the entrance of the alley cast muted white light over Shauna\u2019s shoulder and had settled on Banjo. Danyon saw he had broken into a heavy sweat, and his body was shaking violently. Either he was really nervous, or Banjo was going through withdrawals. Which ever it was gave Danyon an advantage.</p><p>Wearing heavy black boots, Danyon lifted a foot and parked it between Banjo\u2019s legs, right on his groin.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, man, not them! You can\u2019t do that, bro. It ain\u2019t right\u2014it just ain\u2019t right!\u201d</p><p>Banjo squirmed beneath his foot, and Danyon added a bit more pressure to the guy\u2019s genitals. \u201cWe need some information, and we need it fast. And you\u2019re going to cough it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about! I already told you I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019. I swear, nothin\u2019! Why you been after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you came into my store, wanting to trade secrets for cookies, talking about three dead mice\u2014no teeth\u2014no big fingernails,\u201d Shauna fumed. \u201cI know you were talking about the weres, and I want to know what you know about them. How did you know they didn\u2019t have fangs or claws? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whatchu talkin\u2019 about. I went in the store \u2019cause, like, I was hungry, and the other lady that\u2019s there, she always feedin\u2019 me and stuff. I was\u2014I was hungry. I thought I could get a cookie if I said that. I was hungry, so I said it, you know? They smelled so good and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Danyon pressed his foot down even harder.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, man! You gonna bust \u2019em. Stop! I told you the trut\u2019. I was just hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know about the weres?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat was all that about? The three blind mice and no teeth? You knew about the weres, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Shauna added.</p><p>Banjo shook his head, greasy brown hair falling into his eyes. \u201cWord on the street, just word on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose word?\u201d Shauna asked. \u201cWho told you about the weres?\u201d</p><p>He shook his clasped hands, an adamant prayer for mercy. \u201cLook, I swear to Gawd, I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019. I musta been talkin\u2019 out the side of my neck. I swear, I don\u2019t know!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Danyon smelled fear wafting up from Banjo. And he also smelled a lie. He lifted his foot and tucked the toe of his boot under Banjo\u2019s crotch, making sure it jabbed him in the most sensitive spot.</p><p>\u201cAw, no!\u201d Banjo started crying. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna have nothin\u2019 left. You can\u2019t take \u2019em from me, man! Like I ain\u2019t gonna be able to have kids or nothin\u2019. Ain\u2019t gonna even be able to do it no more.

Don\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>Danyon twisted his foot to the right, jabbed the toe of his boot in a little harder\u2014deeper.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay! I\u2019ll tell ya, okay? Ease off, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpill it first, then I\u2019ll let off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, man...okay, yeah, they got a new drug. I heard about it on the street. Everybody talkin\u2019 about it. Big stuff called Lacodah. People sayin\u2019 it make you strong, keep you buzzin\u2019, like you all wired and stuff, so you can see and smell and hear good. And you can run fast. It\u2019s the shit, man. It\u2019s the shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve taken this new drug?\u201d Shauna asked.</p><p>\u201cMe? No, no. Not me, no. Like I say, I just heard about it on the street.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cThe last time you came to the shop, you were on it. How else could you have smelled those cookies from across the street? With all the people out there, the food smells and alcohol\u2014for you to smell those cookies over all that, I\u2019d say you have a pretty sensitive nose.\u201d</p><p>Danyon gave his foot another sharp twist. \u201cTell the lady the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay! Yeah, okay, I tried it! Once, though. One time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Mattie?\u201d Shauna asked. \u201cI saw the two of you fighting in front of the shop. She dented a light pole with her fist. That much strength, she\u2019s got to be on it, too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know who you talkin\u2019 \u2019bout,\u201d Banjo said. \u201cWho be Mattie? I don\u2019t know her\u2014I swear to Gawd.\u201d</p><p>Danyon grabbed a handful of Banjo\u2019s hair and pulled, forcing the guy to look at him. \u201cIf you keep lying, I\u2019m going to make sure you walk and talk like a girl for the rest of your life. Do you understand me?\u201d</p> <p>Tears streamed down Banjo\u2019s cheeks. \u201cYeah...yeah, I heard. Okay\u2014okay, yeah, Mattie, she takin\u2019 Lacodah, too. I share, you know, share a little bit wit\u2019 her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when does a junkie share anything?\u201d Shauna asked. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d Banjo held his hands out as if to block her words. \u201cI ain\u2019t sellin\u2019 nothin\u2019. That\u2019s sample stuff, you know, sample stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d Danyon asked.</p><p>The young vamp looked up at him, and there was no missing the terror in his eyes. \u201cMan, I can\u2019t say\u2014I can\u2019t do\u2014they gonna kill me. They gonna kill me for sure.\u201d</p><p>Danyon removed his boot from Banjo\u2019s crotch, then parked it on his left shoulder and pushed down until he sat flat on the ground. Then he repositioned his boot between his legs, only now it was in a prime position. He had leverage to work with. Concrete, a heavy boot, and testicles between them. The man was in a bind. Danyon rocked his body forward, so the pressure increased between Banjo\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cMutha\u2014mutha...\u201d Banjo gasped. Danyon pressed down a little harder, and Banjo\u2019s mouth fell open. He looked like a fish out of water, gasping for air. When Danyon released the pressure on his testicles, it was as though Banjo\u2019s body needed time to absorb the knowledge that it was no longer restricted. He sat frozen, his mouth hanging open for a four-count before he finally blinked.</p><p>\u201cNext time they\u2019re going flat,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cUnless you tell us what we need to know.\u201d</p> <p>Banjo started weeping loudly. He put his hands over his face, sobbing. \u201cI can\u2019t! Man, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re sayin\u2019\u2014I\u2019m gonna be dead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be dead either way,\u201d Danyon promised. \u201cTell me what you know. Who\u2019s in this with you?\u201d He forced Banjo\u2019s head up by the hair again. \u201cAnd this is the last time I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>Keeping the pressure on his genitals, Danyon squatted in front of Banjo and rocked his body forward so that he was only inches from his face. The pressure from his boot evidently shot the pain level up to excruciating, because even in the dim light Danyon saw the guy\u2019s face turn purple.</p><p>To make sure he got his point across, Danyon lowered his head, allowed some of the anger he had been holding back to rush through him. He concentrated on one section of his body and soon felt the muscles in his neck begin to ripple and move up to his cheek. He shifted his head to one side to regulate the mutation\u2014snout elongating, fangs bared.</p><p>Banjo jerked his head back so hard he smashed it against the brick wall behind him.</p><p>\u201cHoly mother, not that! Okay, yeah, okay, it was the voodoo man! The fat man. He\u2019s got somethin\u2019 to do wit\u2019 it, but that\u2019s all I know. He get that voodoo stuff going wit\u2019 that snake, and\u2014I\u2014that\u2019s all I know. That\u2019s all. He\u2019s the one call it Lacodah\u2014not the snake, the stuff. The stuff that makes you run fast, that\u2019s Lacodah. That\u2019s him, man, I swear\u2014that\u2019s all I know. Okay\u2014don\u2019t tear my face off, okay? Don\u2019t kill me!\u201d Banjo wailed at the top of his lungs, \u201cOh, God, don\u2019t kill me!\u201d</p><p>Danyon had to wonder what breed of vampire would take this much pain and not transform.</p><p>\u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want to die!\u201d Banjo cried.</p><p>Danyon drew in a deep breath, held it, closed his eyes for a moment, and felt his human features return. Then he removed his foot from Banjo and stood, leaving the guy in a sniveling, blubbering heap.</p><p>Without another word, Danyon walked the length of the alley, took Shauna\u2019s hand, and headed north.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>As keen as her hearing had been with Gris Gris and Trish earlier on Bourbon, he was surprised that she hadn\u2019t heard what Banjo had said.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>Eyes forward, his mind\u2019s eye locked on a vision of his prey, Danyon lengthened his stride.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to see a man about a snake.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>Papa Gris Gris\u2019 Voodoo Shop was located on Rampart Street, on the ground floor of a two-story shotgun house. The foot traffic on Rampart wasn\u2019t anything near what they had just come through in the heart of the Quarter, but it was still heavier than a standard business day.</p><p>Gris Gris\u2019 shop was teeming with customers, even at this late hour, as was T-Boy\u2019s T-Shirt Shop, Bailey\u2019s Praline Store, and Sistah\u2019s, Lurnell\u2019s mystic shop. All three stores were on the same side of the street and attached at the hip, Sistah\u2019s being on the end. Shauna could only imagine what Lurnell\u2019s reaction would be if she knew she was going into her competitor\u2019s store. The last thing Lurnell had to worry about, though, was her buying anything from Gris Gris, especially after Danyon had told her what he had gotten out of Banjo and why they were all but racing to Rampart.</p><p>Danyon had asked her how she had not heard Banjo squawling about Gris Gris and Lacodah when she had heard Trish and Gris Gris in the middle of Bourbon. Shauna had managed to dodge the question by claiming she had been preoccupied guarding the alleyway entrance, making sure no one else came in\u2014and no one went out. That hadn\u2019t been the whole truth. All of the truth was that she had indeed been guarding the alley entrance, but her thoughts had been preoccupied with how stupid she had acted back in that bar with Big Frank Macina.</p><p>What on earth had possessed her to confront such a bear of a man that way? It had been tacky, unproductive and just plain stupid. The excuse she had given herself about why she had done it was that she had thought a direct approach\u2014a blatant confrontation\u2014might shake some information out of Macina. It had really started out that way, then something inside of her just sort of snapped, and she became a runaway train. Fortunately, Danyon hadn\u2019t confronted her about it or reprimanded her like she was a child. She could only hope that it was because he had accepted what had happened, knew she couldn\u2019t go back and change it, and that she was mature enough to see how she could have handled it differently.</p><p>There were two signs attached to the screen door that was the entrance to Gris Gris\u2019 shop. One read Open and the one beneath it Push, which she did.</p><p>She had never been inside the voodoo shop and was surprised to see that it looked nothing like A Little Bit of Magic or Sistah\u2019s. She couldn\u2019t understand why Lurnell saw Gris Gris as such a threat. The only merchandise he sold were voodoo masks, altar supplies, a few books on the history of voodoo, and some wooden statues that looked as though they had been carved by a second grader. Gris Gris sold them as totems, guaranteeing that they would strengthen any spell offered on any practitioner\u2019s altar.</p><p>Shauna suspected that Gris Gris\u2019 biggest income generator was himself. He wasn\u2019t shy about claiming to be one of the most powerful voodoo practitioners in the south, as well as a psychic with extraordinary abilities. She suspected that his steady customers were people stuck on the road to hopelessness that appeared to have no end, and they saw Gris Gris as their last resort.</p><p>Within ten feet of the entrance of the shop, was a narrow stairway that led to the second floor and a voodoo museum that you could tour for an additional five dollars.</p><p>There may have been fifteen people in the shop when Shauna and Danyon entered, but it felt like many more in the cramped space. The customers who were there talked in hush tones as they walked about, examining pictures on the wall and different pieces of merchandise, all of which, Shauna noticed, didn\u2019t carry a price tag. It was a shake-down technique used by some small shop owners. Without a price tag, they were able to size up the customer examining the merchandise. Then, when the customer asked about cost, the shop owner would wing a price off the top of his head, basing it on the quality and size of the customer\u2019s clothes and jewelry. The bigger the jewelry and the higher end the clothes, the higher the price for the piece of merchandise. It was a practice Shauna and her sisters abhorred. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gris Gris sat behind an old wooden desk in a double-wide, ladder-back chair at the rear of the room. He probably claimed that both the chair and desk were antiques, but Shauna would have bet her own shop that both came from Goodwill.</p><p>The chair creaked as he rocked, his eyes ever watchful as customers picked up and examined different items. He appeared quite content, like someone who had discovered the secret to peace while still living in a chaotic world. Either that, or someone really stoned who lived in total oblivion. He wore a long-sleeved, billowing white shirt and heaven only knew what else, because the rest of him was hidden under the desk. Shauna wasn\u2019t surprised to find that seeing Gris Gris up close was no different than seeing him from afar. He looked the same\u2014ugly. His eyes, nose and mouth were too small for his face, and his fingers looked like stubby, albino sausages, and he smelled...moldy.</p><p>Like Gris Gris didn\u2019t have enough going for him, the boa constrictor served as the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. Only rarely, if ever, did anyone see Gris Gris without that six-foot boa draped about his neck, and either one or both of Gris Gris\u2019 hands were always in motion, stroking, petting the snake as it slowly coiled its tail up, then relaxed it. Its head and at least a third of its body would undulate over Gris Gris\u2019 rotund stomach. The sight was not for the faint of heart\u2014or stomach.</p> <p>Using subtle body language and eye signals, Shauna and Danyon made up their minds to stall in the front section of the shop and wait for most, if not all, of the customers to leave before they confronted him. They pretended to be looking at the different pictures and masks that hung on the wall.</p><p>\u201cRemember, you\u2019re leaving this guy to me,\u201d Danyon whispered, when they found a moment of privacy.</p><p>Shauna nodded, felt her face grow hot and knew she must have been blushing different shades of crimson from embarrassment. She didn\u2019t blame him for wanting to handle Gris Gris after the way she had dealt with Big Frank Macina.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ms. MacDonald, what a pleasant surprise,\u201d Gris Gris said, when she and Danyon finally approached his desk. The boa lifted its yellow-striped head, as if curious to see who Gris Gris was addressing. \u201cMmm...and who\u2019s your handsome friend?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Surprised by the lecherous look Gris Gris was giving Danyon, she said, \u201cThis is Danyon Stone. Danyon, this...\u201d She paused, realizing she didn\u2019t know Gris Gris\u2019 real name, then decided to use what she did know. \u201cThis is Papa Gris Gris.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharmed,\u201d Gris Gris said, and held out a hand.</p><p>Danyon didn\u2019t reach for it.</p><p>Gris Gris retracted his hand slowly, resumed petting the boa in long slow strokes and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHow may I help the two of you this evening?\u201d Gris Gris asked Shauna.</p><p>\u201cWe need some information from you,\u201d Danyon said.</p><p>Gris Gris rested his head against the back of his chair and rocked steadily. \u201cAnd what information might that be, Mr. Stone?\u201d</p> <p>Danyon stared at the fat man, and Gris Gris returned the stare. They held eye contact for so long, Shauna thought both had fallen into a trance.</p><p>\u201cI think you already know what kind of information I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Danyon finally said.</p><p>Gris Gris laughed. \u201cWell, I must admit that my psychic abilities are indeed acute, but, unfortunately, not in every situation or circumstance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think you have to be a psychic to know this.\u201d</p><p>Gris Gris grinned, rocked back, then said, \u201cMr. Stone, please do get to the point. As you can see, I have customers to tend to. If you insist on playing these guessing games, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d</p><p>Shauna was standing at Danyon\u2019s side, and she felt the muscles in his arms tense against her body. No question he wanted to punch the fat man square in the face. She had to admit that she was curious to see how Danyon was going to handle this. Gris Gris was human. Wolven, vampires, and shape-shifters maintained an unspoken rule\u2014they didn\u2019t openly admit their true nature to a human. If Danyon found out Gris Gris was involved in the wolven deaths, however, she was confident he would make an exception to that rule.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you\u2019ve heard that there have been three murders recently,\u201d Danyon said.</p><p>Gris Gris arched a brow. \u201cReally? Three\u2014is that all?\u201d</p> <p>Danyon scowled. \u201cHow dare you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Stone, relax. You take life much too seriously. I do watch the news you know. Since Katrina, it\u2019s common knowledge that New Orleans is viewed as one of the top five cities in America with the highest murder rate per capita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe three I\u2019m talking about happened not far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Gris Gris said. \u201cAnd your point?\u201d</p><p>Danyon\u2019s face grew darker. \u201cI was curious as to whether you had heard anything about them. Knew any information about the murders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow why would I be privy to such information?\u201d Gris Gris asked.</p><p>Danyon allowed a long pause to follow Gris Gris\u2019 question before answering, \u201cIt\u2019s often surprising what some people are privy to.\u201d</p><p>A light twinkled in Gris Gris\u2019 eyes. \u201cVery true, Mr. Stone.\u201d He glanced around Danyon to Shauna. \u201cDo forgive me for not asking earlier, Shauna, but how are your sisters, Fiona and Caitlin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re well, thank you,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>\u201cAnd your business? Thriving I hope?\u201d</p><p>Shauna answered with a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cSplendid. I\u2019m so glad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, are y\u2019all in line?\u201d Two middle-aged women wearing matching floral dresses stepped up behind Danyon. One was sweating profusely and fanning herself with a small piece of cardboard.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are,\u201d Danyon said sharply, and both women stepped back immediately.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry... I apologize for...we didn\u2019t mean to interrupt,\u201d the woman with the fan said hastily. \u201cI wanted to make an appointment for a reading and thought the gentleman sitting behind the desk was the person I needed to make the appointment with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am indeed, and you may,\u201d Gris Gris said to her, then narrowed his eyes at Danyon.</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>\u201cIf you will excuse me, Mr. Stone\u2014Ms. MacDonald. I have clients who need my assistance\u2014paying clients.\u201d</p><p>Shauna slid a hand into the front pocket of her jeans, pulled out two twenty-dollar bills and tossed them on the desk. \u201cYes, you do indeed have paying clients.\u201d</p><p>With a slight shake of his head and roll of his eyes, Gris Gris turned to the two women. \u201cLadies, I will be happy to assist you as soon as I\u2019m done with these...two.\u201d</p><p>The woman without the fan suddenly gasped. \u201cOh, my word\u2014it moved! Is that a real snake around your neck?\u201d</p><p>Gris Gris smiled broadly and stroked the boa. Even his teeth were too small for his head. \u201cOh, yes, Simone is quite real. Isn\u2019t she lovely?\u201d</p><p>Danyon cleared his throat loudly.</p><p>Gris Gris tsked, \u201cLadies, if you will excuse us\u2014and in exchange for your patience, I would like to offer you a free tour of our voodoo museum, which is right at the top of that stairwell. Please, take your time and enjoy the artifacts. I am certain my business here will conclude...\u201d His eyes fell on Danyon. \u201c...shortly.\u201d</p><p>The women thanked him profusely and headed up the stairs.</p><p>Once they were out of sight and hearing range, Gris Gris\u2019 calm, nonchalant demeanor abruptly changed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, what do you want, Stone? Why are you here busting my balls like this? I\u2019ve never done anything to you. Hell, I don\u2019t even know you.\u201d</p><p>Shauna did a double take. The few times she had heard Gris Gris speak, his high-brow style and diction had been superfluous. His sudden \u201chome-boy\u201d talk took her aback.</p><p>\u201cI can only guess what else you\u2019re faking,\u201d Danyon said to him. \u201cBut what I really want is more information about the new product line you\u2019ve got out on the street right now.\u201d</p><p>Gris Gris frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name \u2018lacodah\u2019 mean anything to you?\u201d</p><p>As hard as Gris Gris worked to keep his expression neutral, Shauna noticed the flicker of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the slightest idea what you\u2019re talking about, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, there are a couple people on the street telling me different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you? You a cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I know quite a few.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that have to do with anything? I don\u2019t know anything about no locodi, Bonighnigh, whatever the hell you called it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s strange,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cBecause the way I\u2019ve heard it on the street, you\u2019re the man and the direct connection to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who you talked to, and I really don\u2019t give a damn. All I know is you\u2019ve got the wrong person.\u201d</p><p>Simone, apparently sensing Gris Gris\u2019 growing agitation, began undulating rapidly, the bottom half of her body coiling in tighter. Her tail curled around Gris Gris\u2019 neck, the tip of it overlapping her head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, baby,\u201d Gris Gris said, stroking her head calmly. \u201cDaddy\u2019s fine. These bad people are going away now. It\u2019s okay.\u201d As he petted her and spoke soothingly, Simone began to relax, her tail dropping away from around Gris Gris\u2019 neck. \u201cThere you go...you\u2019re such a sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>When Simone had calmed completely, her head gently bobbing from side to side, Gris Gris looked up at Danyon.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying, Mr. Stone. Feel free to search this place. Call the police if you must. But if I may offer one piece of advice, as in any area of life, you should always be careful about what you ask for and look for. Because you just might find it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d call today a bust,\u201d Danyon said, leaning against the grave of Gustav Henry. They were sitting in St. Louis I Cemetery, across the street from Gris Gris\u2019. They had hit a stalemate. At the moment, keeping an eye out for any unusual activity coming in or going out of Gris Gris\u2019 shop, anything that might direct them toward their next move, was about all they could do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe night\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Shauna said, sitting on the concrete lip of a nearby crypt. \u201cAnd besides, it wasn\u2019t a total bust. We linked a couple of things together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you\u2019re being pretty optimistic. And even if we did link one or two things together, I wouldn\u2019t try pulling anything with it. The links would break. They\u2019re too weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what about the whole thing with Banjo and Gris Gris? I mean, he fingered the snake guy for heaven\u2019s sake. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re just going to dismiss that?\u201d</p> <p>Danyon shrugged. \u201cReally, when you think about it, Banjo could have been blowing hot air up our rear ends. He\u2019s a junkie, I know, but he\u2019s a conniving junkie. He might have rattled off the first name that came into his head just because he was scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if he did, can you blame him?\u201d Shauna said. \u201cYou were pretty convincing back there. If I would have been the one trapped under your boot like that, I would have spilled my guts in a nanosecond.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a half smile. \u201cHey, you know, that brings up something that\u2019s had me stumped since we left the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I would have confronted a regular vampire, like I did with Banjo back there, don\u2019t you think he would have at least flashed his fangs or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d bet on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t Banjo? What kind of vampire is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what breed of vampire he is. David Dulac had said something about Banjo during the meeting. He knows the vamp is different, but said he wasn\u2019t sure if that was due to him being the product of a cross-breeding, or if it had something to do with the drugs he\u2019s been using for years. I really don\u2019t have a clue myself. Fiona would probably know more, since she\u2019s his Keeper.\u201d</p><p>Danyon shook his head. \u201cNow that I think about it, I should have handled things differently back in the alley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I should\u2019ve done was as soon as Banjo fingered Gris Gris, I should have grabbed the little weasel and brought him here with us. Then force him and Gris Gris into a face-off.\u201d</p> <p>Shauna laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u2019</p><p>\u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t help it. I know a face-off between the two of them would probably get serious quick. But when you first mentioned it, I suddenly got a picture in my head of Laurel and Hardy. You know, fat guy, skinny guy?\u201d</p><p>Danyon grinned. \u201cHow do you know about Laurel and Hardy? Even the reruns of their movies stopped playing long before you were born.\u201d</p><p>Shauna shrugged. \u201cI like old movies, and they do make DVDs you know.\u201d</p><p>Her smile made Danyon\u2019s heart flip-flop in his chest. He forced himself to look away. He had to keep his mind on business. \u201cHave you heard anything from Fiona, Caitlin, Jagger, anybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her smile quickly fading. \u201cI won\u2019t know anymore than you do until I see them again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t your sisters call if they found anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t carry a cell phone, so they have no way to reach me.\u201d</p><p>He cocked his head, surprised. \u201cI thought everyone carried a cell phone these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause wherever I go, I like to be where I am. A cell phone only divides your attention\u2014all the texting, beeping, buzzing, call-waiting, call-forwarding, voice mail. It\u2019s no wonder that there is so much anger in the world. No one has a moment\u2019s peace to regroup their thoughts, to really think through their problems so they can find a solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Danyon stood up and stretched, working out the kink forming in his lower back.</p><p>\u201cYou know, you may be right about something,\u201d Shauna said.</p><p>\u201cMe? Right?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhat you said about Banjo blowing hot air\u2014that sort of ties in to what you said earlier about Gris Gris being in no physical condition to hold down a were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014are you saying I may be right about two things? We should call the local paper. That\u2019s headline news!\u201d</p><p>Shauna tsked, then chuckled. \u201cI know, I know. But let\u2019s think this through for a minute. Banjo ratting out Gris Gris doesn\u2019t make very much sense when you take into account the big man\u2019s physical liabilities. Banjo might be screwed up on drugs, and he might be conniving, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s stupid. If he was lying, I think he\u2019s sharp enough to have picked a much more likely candidate. Either that, or he figured we were stupid enough to fall for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but since we\u2019re thinking this through\u2014you know, the two things I was right about? Banjo could have been telling the truth, only we\u2019re looking at it from a physical perspective. Gris Gris may not be doing the physical work, like restraining the were, wrapping him in cable. Maybe he\u2019s orchestrating the whole thing. Who the heck knows?\u201d Danyon walked over and sat beside her. \u201cIt very well could have started out one way and wound up another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when August said that the murderer\u2019s motive might be similar to a trapper\u2019s? Someone who hunts alligators and bear, specifically for their claws and fangs, because they make jewelry out of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I remember when he told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what if the murderer started off that way, you know, harvesting were claws and fangs to make expensive jewelry, it would have to be expensive because they\u2019re rare. Then somehow, the murderer winds up ingesting a few granules of either the claws or fangs when he\u2019s grinding them down for jewelry. He ends up with a serious buzz, one a lot different than he\u2019s felt from any other drug. He discovers he\u2019s stronger, faster, more agile. By process of elimination, he figures out where the buzz came from, and he\u2019s off to the races from there.\u201d</p><p>Shauna shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even like thinking about what those races might look like. People are so beyond their own limits now. Even a hint of something that powerful being available on the street\u2014it would be like August said. The death toll would become astronomical. Weres might even become extinct.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scary thought for sure.\u201d</p><p>Shauna propped her arms on her knees and lowered her head. \u201cDo you think that it\u2019s only happened in this area? Do you think there are other weres in other states going through this right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard news about it happening anywhere else,\u201d Danyon said. \u201cAnd I hope we don\u2019t. If similar were murders show up anywhere else that would only confirm what you just said\u2014it would be the beginning of the end. I try not to think about how big the problem could get. I just want to focus on this area and our weres right now.\u201d</p><p>Danyon glanced over at the voodoo shop. The lights were still on, and he saw shadows from people walking back and forth in front of the screen door. He had seen some customers leave the shop and new ones come in, but nothing out of the ordinary. No suspicious looking characters, only curious tourists.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Gris Gris meant when he said you should be careful about what you look for?\u201d Shauna asked. She was looking toward the shop, as well. \u201cIdle threat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s all it was. The guy\u2019s good at pulling off a con. Look how his accent and entire manner of speaking changed when he was pressed to the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Shauna said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I mean, it\u2019s not like I know him well. I\u2019ve seen him around a time or two, occasionally cross him on the street in the Quarter, but I\u2019ve never heard him roll into street talk that way. He always came across rather highbrow. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Danyon nodded, but didn\u2019t offer more.</p><p>It was getting late and traffic was slowing on Rampart. The praline shop next to Gris Gris\u2019 had already closed for the night. He felt frustrated and as useless as a spigot on a rock. Too many maybes had sent them chasing shadows that led them nowhere.</p><p>Maybe the claws and fangs were being pulverized and sold as a drug. Maybe Big Frank was tied to it simply because he wanted his gang to upstage the Bloods and the Crips. Maybe Gris Gris was involved. Maybe Banjo had been telling the truth when he had fingered the snake man after Danyon had put the squeeze on him. Maybe all of this was about a new drug, but then again...maybe not.</p><p>Danyon was used to addressing problems at the root cause. The challenge he had here, though, was that he had no roots to work with. His frustration and desire to do something, to find whoever, or whatever, was responsible for the murders, grew by the hour, and that was causing him to make bad decisions.</p><p>It would have been smarter had he taken a more subtle approach to Gris Gris, instead of confronting him head on. If the slime ball was responsible for the were deaths in any way, all Danyon had done was alert him to the fact that they suspected him. If anything, Gris Gris would be more cautious now about where he went and who he spoke to. The same applied to Big Frank Macina, since Shauna all but shoved an accusation up his nose.</p><p>Banjo didn\u2019t really concern Danyon. The guy stayed so drugged most of the time, he probably had trouble remembering from one hour to the next what he had said, much less what he had heard or done.</p><p>If he was going to be truthful with himself, then Danyon had to admit that neither he nor Shauna knew what the hell they were doing. If drive and heartfelt passion to save and protect the weres were the only two things necessary to solve this case, then it would have been solved long ago.</p><p>The bottom line was easy to sum up. He wasn\u2019t a detective. Neither was she.</p><p>He wondered if Jagger, Fiona, Ryder or Caitlin had had any luck in the areas they were monitoring. If they had uncovered any clues that might lead everyone in a different, more productive direction.</p><p>And what about the weres? Had the sentinels who were assigned to post by the remaining Southern alphas spotted anything? Something that might shed more light on the case, offer some clarification? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If everyone returned empty-handed, then they would have no choice but to bring in additional help.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t an easy thing for Danyon to admit. He took great pride in being an alpha, and never once had he ever considered his role as leader, protector, defender a burden.</p><p>It was his purpose in life.</p> <p>Pride would have to take a backseat. The only thing that mattered was the safety of the weres, protecting them against the psychopath who had already killed three of their own.</p><p>If it took a boatload of vampires, a battalion of shifters and every breed of were in North America to find the murderer and stop him from killing again, then bring them on.</p><p>Since the final directive to call in additional, outside help had to come from August, Danyon planned to speak to him about it as soon as everyone met up again. And they were scheduled to gather in August\u2019s conference room in the morning.</p><p>He swiped a hand over his face, wishing he could wipe away the fatigue that weighed him down, and the sense of defeat that wanted to drown him.</p><p>In that moment, he felt Shauna rest a hand gently on his arm.</p> <p>So reassuring and soothing. So calming. It was as though she had heard his every thought.</p><p>Danyon closed his eyes, and allowed himself to get lost in her touch. And in that one blissful moment, he found absolute peace.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>After quietly slipping back into her clothes, Shauna grabbed her sneakers and snuck out of Danyon\u2019s bedroom, where he still lay sleeping, then out of the penthouse. She rode the private elevator down to the back entrance, then put on her sneakers and headed outside.</p><p>It was a little after 4:00 a.m., the only time of day when New Orleans\u2019 streets were relatively quiet. This morning she heard a chorus of hydraulic hisses from trash trucks cleaning the streets down in the Quarter. She certainly didn\u2019t envy their job this morning. No doubt the mountain of trash left over from a half million people celebrating Nuit du Dommage would rival Mt. Everest.</p><p>Shauna glanced up at the dark, clear sky and saw that the moon was nearing its apex. She didn\u2019t worry about Danyon\u2019s wolven during a full moon because they were a breed of werewolves whose transformation trigger wasn\u2019t dependent on the moon. But she did worry about humans, because their emotions seemed to be at the mercy of any full-faced moon. Any policeman or hospital worker would testify to that. During a full moon cycle, the number of crimes blew through the roof, and emergency rooms overflowed with victims, as well as perpetrators, of gunshot wounds, stabbings, cuts and broken bones from fights, and a myriad of injuries from car accidents spurred by road-rage.</p> <p>A full moon always made Shauna restless. Add to that restlessness her worry about a murderer targeting her weres, and she wound up with a bad case of insomnia.</p><p>Although she hadn\u2019t said anything to Danyon, Shauna feared he was right. They had been running after shadows and were making little to no progress. Even worse, she had an unsettling feeling that all hell was about to break loose. She had turned all the few, ragged pieces of information they had collected over the last two days over and over in her mind until they made even less sense than they did before. The only way she knew to clear her head was to move\u2014jog\u2014run.</p><p>The predawn air was crisp, and the humidity low. Shauna breathed in deeply, then began to stretch her back, arms, and legs. There were very few street lights along Burgundy, almost non-existent when compared to the heart of the Quarter, but, with the help of the moon, she had plenty to light her way.</p><p>After a few minutes of stretching, Shauna started off with a slow jog. She quickened her pace after two blocks, then broke into a full run after four. The wind in her face, heart rate rising, the sound of her sneakers thumping rhythmically on the sidewalk\u2014this was her safe haven. The rest of the world was welcome to all the Xanax on the market. This was her drug of choice.</p><p>Soon, the worries that clogged her mind began to slip away.</p><p>Shauna was only a few blocks from Esplanade, which she planned to take south to the French Market, when she caught sudden movement off to her left, out of the corner of her eye. It barely had time to register in her brain before she found herself abruptly slammed to the ground by a flying tackle.</p><p>In a flash, a hand clamped over her mouth and a knee dug into her back. Shock kept Shauna immobile for a moment or two, then she started kicking, tried to scream, flailed her arms in an attempt to throw her attacker off balance. Something cold and metal was slapped across her left wrist. Then it tightened and clicked.</p><p>Handcuffs?</p> <p>In a full blown panic now, Shauna screamed into the hand covering her mouth and swung her right arm wildly to keep it from being restrained. The struggle proved futile, however. Her attacker pinned her arm and cuffed it so quickly she might as well have been paralyzed.</p><p>Shauna kicked out with both feet, jerked her body from side to side, frantic to escape. Another hand grabbed a fistful of her hair and yanked hard, forcing her to her feet. She had yet to catch even a glimpse of her attacker.</p><p>With one hand clamped over her mouth and another wrapped tightly in her hair, Shauna was shoved into motion. She kicked backwards, first with her right foot, then with her left, wanting to connect with a knee, a shin, testicles. When that failed, she tried to run, but was immediately jerked back by the hair, then shoved forward faster.</p><p>Soon she was forced into an alley on the right, then left, behind a building\u2014left again into another alley. Tears streamed down Shauna\u2019s cheeks, which made her angry. The last thing she needed to do right now was cry. With a hand over her mouth, if her nose got stuffed up, she wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe. And what good would crying do anyway? She had to keep her head clear and figure out a way to break free.</p><p>The hand over her mouth pressed harder over her lips, but Shauna still managed to open her mouth just wide enough to bite down on a small pad of flesh. She bit hard into the palm, and twisted from side to side, like a dog with a bone.</p><p>It was then that something hard and heavy slammed down on Shauna\u2019s head. And the moon went from full...to black.</p><p>When Shauna\u2019s eyes fluttered open, it didn\u2019t take long for her to realize she wasn\u2019t waking from a bad dream. Her hands were still cuffed behind her back, and she was standing, bent in half, the upper part of her body lying on a sheet of plywood that appeared to be some kind of makeshift table. The left side of her head throbbed terribly, and she felt something sticky on her neck and left cheek. She figured it was blood.</p><p>Shauna tried to stand up and realized that her legs had been pulled back and spread wide apart, and her ankles restrained. She lifted her head and looked about, trying to figure out where she might be. But she could hardly make out a thing. Her eyesight was blurry, and two huge spotlights that stood about twenty feet or so in front of her blinded her all the more.</p><p>She pressed her right cheek against the scratchy plywood and turned her head to the left. Even without the light in her eyes, she only saw shadows and darkness. But there was depth to that darkness, indicating a vast space. She turned her head to the right and saw the same. Whatever this place was, it smelled of dirt, rust, and motor oil.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud clatter echoed around her. It sounded like a heavy tool, like a pipe wrench, falling to a concrete floor. The sound jump-started Shauna\u2019s heart and sent it racing. She lifted herself as high as she could and yelled, \u201cHelp! Somebody, help! Hel\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her head was slammed to the plywood, sending a shower of shooting stars before her eyes. Someone held her face down, smashing her nose, forehead, and chin into the plywood. They pressed harder, harder still, fingers digging into the wound she already had on her head. The throbbing pain she had felt only moments ago was turned into an excruciating fireworks display in her mind.</p><p>Shauna felt herself fading to black and fought it.</p><p>Can\u2019t lose consciousness! Can\u2019t! Have to fight!</p><p>The shooting stars returned briefly, then blinked out, only to return seconds later in multiples of a thousand.</p><p>Somewhere between dark and light, Shauna realized that her shirt and been pushed up, almost under her arms. And someone was tugging on the waistband of her jeans.</p><p>Tugging\u2014pulling...</p><p>Oh, God, no...not that! Please, not that!</p><p>She had to scream\u2014needed help. Heard a ripping sound\u2014felt a sudden breeze on the back of her thighs.</p><p>Her jeans had been cut off!</p><p>That realization fueled Shauna\u2019s struggle to remain conscious, enough at least for her to open her mouth\u2014to scream.</p><p>Her hair was grabbed again, her head slammed hard against the plywood.</p><p>Now the stars weren\u2019t only before her eyes, they surrounded her\u2014they were her. Nothing else existed.</p><p>Except one sound.</p><p>One...familiar...sound.</p><p>A high pitched, twittering laugh. That laugh. That horrible, wretched laugh snapped Shauna back to consciousness, like a bullwhip coming out of high flight.</p><p>\u201cBanjo!\u201d she yelled. Shauna wanted him to know that she knew he was the one behind her.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>She felt hands on her bare back, rough clothing rubbing against the back of her thighs. And the laughter grew louder and louder.</p><p>\u201cBanjo, stop! It\u2019s Shauna MacDonald. Stop!\u201d</p><p>He began to singsong and wiggled his body against her thighs, her buttocks. \u201cGonna get me some\u2014get me some\u2014get some!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up, Banjo!\u201d a woman\u2019s voice shouted.</p><p>It sounded like it came from a distant place, and it was immediately followed by a metallic echo, as if her voice had bounced off metal walls\u2014aluminum walls...</p><p>Was she trapped in a warehouse? Who was the woman?</p><p>\u201cHehehe, SQUAWK!\u201d That laughter again, then, \u201cShe ain\u2019t gonna give it up, give it up. So Banjo\u2019s gonna take it! Take it\u2014no give it up\u2014I take it!\u201d Banjo squealed like a school kid excited over Christmas.</p><p>\u201cI said shut your goddamn mouth, you little turd!\u201d</p><p>Shauna screamed, \u201cHelp me! Help!\u201d If Banjo wasn\u2019t able to hear her because he was too doped up, she had to hope that someone, somewhere would hear her screams.</p><p>\u201cShut that bitch up!\u201d the woman yelled.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t nobody gonna hear. Nobody gonna. Too far\u2014too far in the middle of nooowheres!\u201d Banjo sang. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cStop with your \u2019effin singing and just do it already!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou leave me alone!\u201d Banjo said, his voice suddenly clear and his words sharp. \u201cYou understand? Leave me alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you, you sonofabitchin\u2019 half-breed. You wanna dick around with me? Fine, then consider your turn lost, asshole. Get the hell away from her. He\u2019ll take his turn and yours, too.\u201d</p> <p>He? Someone else besides Banjo and the woman?</p><p>Shauna prayed for a miracle. If Banjo was that clear-headed now, maybe she could get through to him. Maybe he would hear her and realize what he was doing and who he was trying to do it to.</p><p>\u201cBanjo, it\u2019s Shauna! Don\u2019t\u2014help me get out of here!\u201d</p><p>A dirty, oily smelling rag was suddenly shoved into her mouth. Shauna gagged against it. She shook her head frantically and pushed her tongue against the rag, trying to force it out of her mouth.</p><p>It was shoved in farther.</p> <p>\u201cI said back off her. You lost your turn!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said leave me the hell alone, bitch! It\u2019s about damned time somebody started giving you orders, Kara Matiste!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you? You just said my name! She\u2019s not deaf, you dumb shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa ho ho\u2014scare now, are you?\u201d Banjo\u2019s piercing laughter was the one thing that didn\u2019t change. His voice and words may have found a balanced cadence, but not the laughter. The change in Banjo\u2019s diction reminded her of how Gris Gris had gone from his usual snooty repertoire to \u201chome talk\u201d in a matter of minutes.</p><p>And Kara\u2014alpha of the West Bank\u2014one of her weres had been a murder victim. Why was she here? How did she tie in to Banjo? And why was she encouraging him to do the unthinkable?</p><p>\u201cYou are going to do what I say, when I say it!\u201d Kara yelled at Banjo.</p> <p>Banjo pressed his body firmly against Shauna\u2019s naked thighs, then began to hump them, the way he had dry-humped the stage in the strip club.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s got the power now, Missy Pissy Kara?\u201d Banjo said. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s the goddamn idiot. The biggest mistake you made was giving me a sample of that mojo. See what it did? Who\u2019s in control now? Guess who\u2019s got all the power now? Oh, and looky, looky who\u2019s gonna get some of this sweet, sweet stuff.\u201d Banjo wriggled against Shauna, and she feared she would vomit and wind up smothering in it.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t shut the hell up, I swear I will take a tire iron and shove it clear up your ass, all the way up to your ugly, pointed head,\u201d Kara screamed.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Then whatchu gonna do? Who ya gonna get to lure your little weres to a special place so that fat freak over there can do his hoodoo? Who ya gonna get to bait \u2019em, if I ain\u2019t around, huh? Ain\u2019t nobody else gonna do your dirty work for a little Lacodah and a piece of ass. They gonna want cold cash, baby. Something you and that fat snake freak ain\u2019t never gonna wanna part with. Noo, you gotta save up that blood money for new digs, like you had when old Carl was around, ain\u2019t that right? Tell me, whatchu gonna do, Kara Matiste, when everybody finds out you two been killin\u2019 off weres? How you gonna explain that, Miss Badass? Killin\u2019 \u2019em off for the power trip, \u2019cause only the strong survive, right? Power, man\u2014it\u2019s the power trip rush. It\u2019s the money rush. You stuck in it, tangled all up in its web. You\u2019re one sick bitch.\u201d</p><p>A monstrous growl echoed through the building.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get your head out of your ass and remember who\u2019s still in charge of this operation,\u201d Kara said.</p><p>Shauna couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. If what Banjo was saying was true, Kara had genocide planned for her own species! And all for money? How was it possible for anyone to do such a horrible thing to their own kind?</p><p>Banjo began to sing a crippling tune...\u201cMoney-money-money, yeah! You don\u2019t have me to use as bait, and you not gonna be rolling in the dough no more, baby. Stashin\u2019 all that blood cash away.\u201d Banjo tsked. \u201cUh-uh, no more, no more Lacodah to sell, not without old Banjo.\u201d</p> <p>Another growl, this one so loud and menacing it hurt Shauna\u2019s ears and seemed to make the building vibrate. Then she heard a loud thump, then...silence.</p><p>And then came the horrid, twittering laugher\u2014that wretched shriek of a laugh told her that Banjo was about to take possession of his final payment for being such a good and helpful boy.</p><p>Shauna tried to scream, but the rag muffled it to a mumble. She shoved her tongue against the nasty piece of cloth again and again, but was only able to move it a fraction of an inch. She had to stop him somehow. Call out his name again\u2014hope he\u2019d hear her, really hear her. Her brain had trouble processing all that was going on. This was the same guy who came into the shop regularly, the one Fiona fed, and now he was trying to rape her? How could he allow himself to do this? Why? What made his jitter talk change? Did he have a split personality? Was it that Lacodah? Or was it the same quirky, unknown thing that made Banjo so different from every other vamp?</p><p>It was evident by Banjo\u2019s frantic movements, that he wasn\u2019t up for hearing another word from anyone. He was in another world, and right now he was working his way toward the next one. The one right between Shauna\u2019s legs. Her tears refused to be held back any longer. They streamed down her cheeks, made her nose clog up.</p><p>Shauna no longer heard Kara and feared she had been left alone with Banjo, who seemed to have gone completely mad. Had he gone mad? Or was this who he really was? Shawna felt like she had been thrown into another dimension without warning, without any knowledge of how to survive in it, or the tools to even try. She was at its mercy.</p><p>She had never known this level of vulnerability before. Hopeless, helpless, useless.</p><p>Banjo grunted behind her, and Shauna squeezed her eyes shut, saying a silent prayer to the universe, begging for this not to happen. It couldn\u2019t happen.</p><p>She shoved against the dirty rag in her mouth with her tongue, once again trying to push it out. This time her efforts were rewarded with a little more movement.</p><p>Then to Shauna\u2019s horror, she felt skin against skin. Banjo had taken his clothes off. He was obviously finished playing games and intended to take care of business now.</p><p>\u201cHey, shit for brains!\u201d It was Kara again.</p><p>Shauna shifted her head slowly, as inconspicuously as possible. She wanted to get a look at the woman. Maybe, just maybe if she could lock eyes with her, Kara might see reason\u2014a woman-to-woman thing. But all she saw were the lights.</p><p>At least Kara\u2019s voice had stopped Banjo from rubbing his naked skin against hers...for now.</p><p>\u201cYou see this, you little turd?\u201d</p><p>And suddenly from the center of the spotlights, Shauna saw a woman with tar-black hair approaching the makeshift table. It was Kara Matiste.</p><p>\u201cDo you see this?\u201d Kara waggled what looked like a two-inch long, glass test tube with a cork in it. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re going to do, Mr. Brilliant, when you fall off the high you\u2019re on? You\u2019ll shrivel, that\u2019s what. What are you going to do then? You think I can\u2019t get another asshole like you to play bait? You forget; you need us a lot more than we need you. There is a lot that goes on behind the scenes in this operation, and you know it. Without me, you don\u2019t get to the big man. So here\u2019s the deal\u2014you\u2019ve got about thirty minutes left on your high horse, then it\u2019s going to buck you off. Are you going to play ballsy or are you going to keep acting like an ass?\u201d</p><p>A long pause, then that wretched, twittering laugh.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2014I know how we roll,\u201d Banjo said. He was jitter talking again, which meant anything\u2014and everything\u2014could happen now.</p><p>With her fear spiking off the charts, Shauna wiggled and twisted, struggling to get away. She knew even if she were able to get Banjo to hear her now, there was no way he or Kara was going to let her go. She had heard too much. That left only one option on this table\u2014she was going to be raped\u2014and die.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, little man, I know you do,\u201d Kara said. \u201cSee this vial? Everything that\u2019s in it will belong to you, I promise\u2014but first you\u2019ve got to tell me who\u2019s the boss around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014You\u2014You the boss!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, and what are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014whatever Kara say. That\u2019s\u2014what we gonna do. Gotta get me some\u2014get me some of that...\u201d Banjo grunted loudly, and Shauna felt him pushing against her again.</p><p>More flesh against flesh now, and his hands were trying to spread her open.</p><p>Shauna\u2019s tears came in a flood. She could barely breathe. It didn\u2019t matter to her anymore if they saw her move and slammed her head against the table. They could cut it off as far as she was concerned. But there was no way she was going down this hellhole without fighting to her last breath.</p><p>She opened her mouth as wide as she could, shoved hard with her tongue, rubbed her mouth against the rough plywood, hoping some little splinter of wood would grab on to threads in the rag.</p><p>\u201cNo need for you to get in a hurry now,\u201d Kara said to Banjo. \u201cRemember, we have an audience. That was part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>Then, as though rising from some black hole, Gris Gris suddenly appeared. Shauna saw him clearly, saw how excited he was to be a spectator at this event. Simone, who was draped about his neck as usual, seemed to be exceptionally calm. Kara appeared alongside Gris Gris and put a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWell, does he plan on getting on with this or should I make reservations for a future matinee?\u201d Gris Gris asked.</p><p>\u201cDrop the big talk,\u201d Kara said. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here you need to impress. He\u2019ll be done with her soon enough, and you\u2019ll have your turn.\u201d</p><p>Then Kara walked up to the table, leaned over, and looked Shauna right in the eye. \u201cPoor, weepy baby. You see what you get for sticking your nose in other people\u2019s business? You should have left it alone.\u201d</p><p>Shauna looked deep into the woman\u2019s eyes, hoping she could hear the question rolling over and over in her head. \u201cWhy\u2014why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSometimes a woman just has to do what she has to do in order to survive in a man\u2019s world,\u201d Kara said. \u201cYou of all people should know that, Shauna MacDonald\u2014Keeper of the weres.\u201d She let out a sarcastic laugh. \u201cKeeper, you can\u2019t even keep your legs closed. You\u2019re out there whoring around with a were, tainting the breed. Then you have the nerve to go around acting like you\u2019re going to save us all? Oh, I think not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s highbrow talking?\u201d Gris Gris asked. \u201cTell your boy to go on about his business. Dip his wick and get it over with, so I can have my turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy turn now\u2014mine,\u201d Banjo said, and wiggled against Shauna again.</p> <p>Kara laughed and stood up, placed the vial right in front of Shauna\u2019s face so she could see it. A fine brown powder that looked like it had glitter mixed in with it was packed inside the vial.</p><p>\u201cYou see, the mistake a lot of women make, the mistake you made, MacDonald, is thinking a woman\u2019s power is between her legs. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s right here in this vial, and I own it. Granted, it was easier for me to get the information I needed to make this happen by appreciating what power I do have between my legs. That\u2019s how I discovered this little secret. An old, horny, blabbering idiot from the council was more than happy to spill his guts for a chance to dip into my honey pot. Sadly, the council got rid of him, because they caught him stealing something or other, but that\u2019s okay. I got what I needed and didn\u2019t really have a use for him anymore. Now everything belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimone is getting anxious, Kara,\u201d Gris Gris said. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with. I want my turn before we have to dispose of her. Too bad, too. Good-looking girl like that. Can\u2019t help it now, though. You and that stupid kid spilling your guts the way you did. Somebody needs to staple both of your fat mouths shut. Now get on with it, boy, or I\u2019ll get me a piece of you instead.\u201d</p><p>Shauna caught a glimpse of Gris Gris petting Simone. And his other hand was petting his groin.</p><p>Oh, God\u2014God!</p> <p>She knew how this would end. How it all was going to play out. Banjo would get his turn at her while Gris Gris watched. Once Banjo was done, the fat man would take his turn. When both were done, Kara would finish her off, kill her if for no other purpose than to make sure she stayed silent\u2014forever.</p><p>Giving one more hard thrust with her tongue, the rag suddenly popped out of Shauna\u2019s mouth, and she opened her mouth wide to scream. No matter where she was, no matter how far away this place was from anything else, she had to try.</p><p>Shauna drew in a quick, deep breath and forced it out to give the scream volume. But a scream didn\u2019t come out of her mouth. Instead, it was a loud, off-pitch howl\u2014the sound of a wolven calling for help. It was long and loud and vibrated from her\u2014from the very center of her. She thought of the way she growled and made other animal noises when she and Danyon made love.</p><p>Then she understood.</p><p>This howl was her call to him, an acknowledgment of the love she had for Danyon and that she knew that love to be endless, timeless. This was her soul calling out to its mate\u2014crying out for him\u2014</p><p>One last time. \u201cWoooah!\u201d Banjo yelled, and Shauna felt him back away from her. \u201cShut her up\u2014shut her. Kara, make her stop. Voodoo man, put the hoodoo on her\u2014put it on, like you do with the weres. You gotta\u2014she sound like one\u2014sound it. Shut her up\u2014shut up!\u201d</p> <p>While Banjo, Kara and Gris Gris yelled at one another, Shauna forced the last bit of air out of her lungs, squeezing the last sound out of her raw vocal chords. It wasn\u2019t much, and what little she had she was losing quickly, but it was enough to keep Banjo freaked out.</p><p>\u201cJust hurry up, you stupid weasel,\u201d Gris Gris yelled.</p><p>\u201cIf you are so anxious for it, old man, why don\u2019t you go first?\u201d Kara asked.</p><p>\u201cJust do it, boy. Finish what you started. Go on, finish it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, can\u2019t\u2014can\u2019t. You hear her? She sound like them\u2014can\u2019t. Do your hoodoo\u2014make her stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, old man, just go over there and get your stuff. The boy ain\u2019t gonna do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do anything unless I watch first,\u201d Gris Gris said. \u201cYou know the drill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold up\u2014hold up!\u201d Banjo exclaimed. His voice two octaves higher and excited. \u201cGot it back\u2014I\u2014got it back.</p> <p>It\u2019s all good\u2014good to go. Looka here\u2014rocky solid\u2014good. Gonna get me some\u2014get some! Rock solid, good to go! Gonna get some\u2014gonna get some!\u201d</p><p>Shauna tried desperately to make a sound\u2014scream, a howl, anything. All she managed was the weakest of howls, so low she could barely make it out.</p><p>\u201cNow, look here at what she did! I can\u2019t now\u2014shut her up, Kara. Shut her\u2014shut! It\u2019s no good no more\u2014all gone. Shut up\u2014you, shut up!\u201d</p><p>Shauna suddenly felt a slap on the back of her thigh. She twisted, bucked, wiggled. Her voice might have been gone, but whatever energy she had left, she planned to wring it dry.</p><p>\u201cStop your jabber-talking,\u201d Kara shouted at Banjo. \u201cIt drives me up a goddamn wall! You wanna stop the bitch from making noise\u2014this is how you do it.\u201d</p><p>Shauna saw black hair, a plaid shirt\u2014a cocked fist up in the air. Kara let out a long, low growl, and Shauna squeezed her eyes shut, waiting for the punch, praying it would be hard enough to knock her out.</p><p>A sudden crash and the sound of shattering glass pried Shauna\u2019s eyes open wide. In that moment, she caught a flash of something huge racing toward them, a second later it sprang into full view.</p><p>It was a massive, mahogany-brown wolven, teeth bared, his eyes locked on Banjo. Shauna\u2019s heart triple-timed in her chest and thundered in her ears. The wolven was Danyon, she knew it as sure as she knew her own name.</p><p>Then, as quickly as the wolven appeared he vanished, his mass flying by her, then out of sight. She heard a growl loud enough to wake the dead, and a heartbeat later came a long shrill, then the ripping and tearing of flesh.</p><p>Shauna squeezed her eyes shut against the sounds, wanting to tap into that small light in the center of her mind\u2014her peaceful place.</p><p>But there were too many screams\u2014too many shrill, tortured, horrific screams.</p><p>Then Kara yelling\u2014Gris Gris shouting back\u2014more tearing and shredding of flesh. Crashing, thudding, feet racing over concrete...silence.</p><p>It felt like hours had gone when Shauna suddenly felt hands around her ankles. She jumped, startled, and tried to scream. All that came out was a raspy whisper. Then she heard the most beautiful sound\u2014Danyon\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cShh, it\u2019s okay now. It\u2019s me, Shauna, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>The next thing she knew she was cradled in Danyon\u2019s arms. She wept as he held her close, rocking her as he would a troubled child. He kissed her forehead, her eyes, her wet cheeks.</p><p>Danyon had never known anger as he did when he saw Banjo standing behind Shauna, naked from the waist down and ready to enter her, to defile her. And the sneer on Gris Gris\u2019 face... And Kara Matiste. He had known she was odd, that there was something very different about her, but he never would have suspected this.</p><p>When he had seen them all together, he wished with his entire heart he could have been in three places at one time. But it wasn\u2019t possible, so he\u2019d had to pick one. Banjo was the greatest threat, so he became Danyon\u2019s primary target. He made sure Banjo understood suffering, when he\u2019d torn through his chest, his arms, his groin, making him feel every ounce of pain to the fullest before he ripped his throat out and watched him drown in his own blood.</p><p>By that time, Kara and Gris Gris were no longer in the warehouse, having scampered away like rats. But they were of little concern to him right now. They\u2019d be found soon enough. His priority now was Shauna.</p><p>She curled into him closer, held on to him tight. \u201cHow...how did you find me?\u201d she asked, her voice shaky and hoarse.</p><p>\u201cIt was easy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou called for me.\u201d</p><p>She lay silent for a moment, then nodded and closed her eyes.</p><p>Danyon smoothed the hair from her brow. She had indeed called to him. Like an alpha female calling for her mate. It was then that Danyon knew without any doubt that Shauna not only understood his true nature, she was part of it. She knew him. She may have been human, but she was still part of his true nature. She knew him in ways he could have only hoped for.</p><p>He tightened his arms around her, feeling such a swell in his chest and heart that there was no denying the power of the love he had for her. He couldn\u2019t ignore it any longer, Shauna was his mate\u2014his alpha.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>St. Louis Cathedral was the perfect location to hold the wedding of the year.</p><p>The colossal, three-steepled basilica was a masterful confluence of Spanish Colonial and Renaissance architecture. Its high rococo-gilded altar included columns with busy entablature. Two rows of wooden columns divided the church into center and side aisles with a view of the gallery. Its massive organ towered at least fifty feet above the choir loft, and its pipes ranged from a few inches to over thirty feet in height.</p><p>It was in this aged splendor, under a massive stretch of sculptured, hand-painted ceiling that Father Antoine\u2019s voice echoed when he said, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife.\u201d</p><p>The cathedral erupted with cheers and applause so loud Shauna expected the thousands of pieces of multi-colored stained glass to shatter. Even if they had, she doubted anyone would notice. Vampires, werewolves, shape-shifters, and humans; all of them laughing and cheering, so happy for the new couple.</p><p>Outside, a twelve-piece, brass band was already playing the traditional rendition of \u201cWhen the Saints Go Marching In.\u201d Saxophones, trombones, tubas and trumpets, along with bass and snare drums were warming up for the second line wedding march, which would take dancing celebrants all the way down to Decatur Street.</p><p>Shauna couldn\u2019t help but tear up at the sight of so many different races with various skin colors, faiths and beliefs, all celebrating as one. It made her overwhelmingly happy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This was the New Orleans she loved, and who loved her back\u2014where friends, neighbors and family had enough faith in each other to put their differences aside and celebrate life\u2014share life.</p><p>This was so different from all the turmoil they had gone through this past year, which, at this moment, seemed a thousand years ago.</p><p>It had been four months since Nicole, Simon and Teddy\u2019s death, and the nightmare Shauna had lived through in that warehouse. It had taken two of those months for Shauna to feel some semblance of normalcy and stop looking over her shoulder every time she walked down a street.</p> <p>Kara had been tracked down not that long ago. She had been found hiding out in a deserted cabin out in a pine forest in Alexandria, Louisiana. August had been the one to take her to Atlanta, where she faced the were-council and magistrate, both of whom were responsible for the were packs living along the entire southern rim of North America. August had returned from that trip alone, and when he did, he looked as though he had aged a hundred years. No one asked him about Kara, and he never offered any information. Judging from his haggard face, and the haunted look in his eyes, it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine the severity of the magistrate\u2019s sentence and Kara\u2019s punishment.</p><p>Two weeks following Kara\u2019s capture, Gris Gris\u2019 body, or what was left of it, was found floating in the marsh by three local fishermen, just north of Lake Pontchatrain. The cause of death had yet to be determined, and Shauna suspected that with the handful of wolven who worked for the coroner\u2019s office and as filing administrators for the Clerk of Court, it might never be. Either that or the death would be labeled accidental. After all, considering the enormity of the man, it wasn\u2019t hard for one to imagine Gris Gris falling out of a skiff...unable to swim...</p><p>Some things in life simply had no direct answers. And some had no answers at all.</p><p>As for Banjo, Danyon had had to stand before the vampire council, which included David Dulac, and give an account of all that had transpired that day in the warehouse. After only a few hours of questioning, the matter was dismissed, and Danyon had been free to go.</p><p>As the jazz band grew louder outside, everyone gathered in the center aisle of the cathedral, ready to head outside and take their place in the second line. Every woman here looked so beautiful dressed in their finery and the men very handsome, especially Jagger in his black, long coat-tailed tuxedo. Amidst the tangle of suits, tuxedos, taffeta dresses, and ball gowns, Shauna caught only a glimpse of the satin, beaded chapel train before the bride was whisked away.</p> <p>Shauna didn\u2019t know how weddings were celebrated in other cathedrals around the country, but old St. Louis seemed to relish the clapping, whistling and joyous chatter.</p><p>As everyone filed through the front doors of the Cathedral, Rita Quinn, August\u2019s assistant, handed each attendee a white, linen handkerchief. The handkerchiefs were a customary and necessary part of a wedding\u2019s second line, for celebrants waved them in the air as they danced their way to the reception.</p><p>So much happiness on the heels of so much pain.</p><p>It seemed like the universe had a way of balancing out the good and bad one had to experience in life. Sometimes it felt like the scales tipped too far to the left and stayed that way too long. But sooner or later, without fail, the universe shifts, and tips that scale in the other direction. Maybe the key to finding peace in life was understanding that times were not always good, but they were not always bad. And if you can learn to straddle the center of that scale as it tips first one way, then the other, life might feel much more balanced.</p><p>Trailing the procession out of the church, Shauna squinted against the brilliance of a cloudless June day.</p><p>The jazz band had already started its march, the musicians bouncing, dancing and swaying as they played their instruments.</p> <p>Following directly behind the band, were the happy bride and groom, both dancing and clapping, determined to celebrate this day for all it was worth. Shauna felt like her heart would burst with joy as she watched the two of them from the top step of the Cathedral\u2014the new Mrs. Lurnell Clarice Johnson and her long awaited new husband, Tyree.</p><p>Trailing the newly married couple was Jagger DeFarge and Fiona, who looked stunning in her satin, emerald green dress. As it turned out, Tyree was in his second year of training as a detective for the NOPD\u2019s eighth precinct. Jagger had been his supervisor since day one, and the two had become close friends. Since Tyree had no biological brothers, he had asked Jagger to be his best man.</p><p>Behind the best man and his beauty were Caitlin and Ryder, both waving handkerchiefs in the air and bouncing in time with the music.</p><p>Not remembering a time when she had felt this happy, Shauna danced her way down the steps of the Cathedral and waved her handkerchief. Sunlight set the two karat diamond on the ring finger of her left hand ablaze, and sparkles of light danced to their own tune.</p><p>The stone was indeed magnificent.</p><p>But not nearly as magnificent as the precious Stone dancing beside her. </p> </body></html>"]
