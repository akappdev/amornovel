Before I knew it, the three of us were plotting some loosely connected stories about three war brides\u2014and their granddaughters. Katherine had been discussing the idea with her editor (who is also mine) and she asked if Lois and I wanted to be part of it.</p><p>My mother was a war bride. Not in the traditional sense, however, as my mother and father married at home during the war. Shortly after their marriage, Dad shipped out to Europe and they didn\u2019t see each other again for three very long years.</p><p>The concept for this anthology appealed to me for another reason, too. My father fought in France and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, near Bastogne. He never spoke of his imprisonment until the end of his life. With his World War II experiences on my mind, I sat in the doctor\u2019s waiting room one day\u2013and stumbled upon a magazine article about the work of the French Resistance. It fascinated me, and my story was born.</p><p>I decided to give my fictional war bride a home in Cedar Cove, Washington, the setting of my ongoing series of books, which started with 16 Lighthouse Road. (The sixth title, 6 Ranier Drive, will be released in September 2006.) I thought that Cedar Cove was the right sort of town for Helen, and I hope you\u2019ll agree.</p><p>I also hope you enjoy 5-B Poppy Lane. This story is special to me because I wrote it in memory of my parents and the love they shared for over sixty years.</p> <p>Debbie Macomber</p><p>P.S. I love to hear from readers. You can reach me at www.debbiemacomber.com or at P.O. Box 1458, Port Orchard, WA 98366.</p><p>To my parents</p><p>Ted and Connie Adler</p><p>who married July 25, 1942</p><p>before my father</p> <p>headed off to war</p><p>Prologue</p><p>Helen Shelton</p><p>5-B Poppy Lane</p><p>Cedar Cove, Washington</p><p>April 1</p><p>My dear Winifred,</p><p>You\u2019ve been on my mind all week, and I decided the best thing to do was simply write. I\u2019m much more comfortable with a pen in my hand than sitting at a computer, not that I have one. I do envy you and Clara communicating via the Internet, though. I got a kick out of Clara\u2019s e-mail address\u2014if that\u2019s the correct term.</p> <p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */</p><p>Yours is obviously because of the secret codes you learned during the war. Unfortunately, those computer machines intimidate me. My granddaughter, Ruth, keeps saying they\u2019re not as difficult as they seem, but I don\u2019t know....</p><p>You remember my friend Charlotte Jefferson-Rhodes. She, too, has encouraged me to learn. She tried to persuade me to sign up for a computer class at the Senior Center, and I considered it for a time\u2014a brief time. But somewhat to Charlotte\u2019s chagrin, I decided I\u2019m just too old and set in my ways. I find holding a fountain pen intensely satisfying, old-fashioned or not. I realize my reluctance is a disappointment to you and Clara, and I apologize. I agree it would be a wonderful way for us to keep in touch. The two of you are as dear to me as family. In my heart, you are family. After the war, it was you, and Sam, of course, who showed me that life was still worth living. I\u2019m deeply indebted to you both.</p><p>Speaking of the war, I find myself thinking more and more about those years in France. I woke in a cold sweat last night, dreaming of Jean-Claude. I\u2019ve never spoken to my children about my experiences during the Second World War because I didn\u2019t know how to tell them I\u2019d been married before and that I\u2019d loved a man other than their father. As you know so well, Sam was my hero, my second chance at love and life. He saved me, and gave me a reason to live. I\u2019ll always be grateful that he brought me to you and Clara. You are the sisters of my heart.</p><p>All these years, I\u2019ve pushed the war memories into the depths of my mind, but now they\u2019re here again, unwanted and unyielding, refusing to leave. I\u2019m thinking that perhaps I should write them down for the family to read after I\u2019m gone. As you\u2019ve so often said, they have a right to know. I\u2019m beginning to agree with you.</p><p>Now enough about that! Let me go on to more pleasant subjects. The main one is your birthday. Your 80th! For years you bemoaned the fact that you were younger than Clara and me. I haven\u2019t heard you mention that lately. At any rate, your birthday\u2019s coming soon and it\u2019s the perfect opportunity for the three of us to get together. Winifred, just imagine\u2014eighty years. Who would ever have believed we\u2019d live this long? I know I didn\u2019t. But then, I always assumed I\u2019d die before Sam. That wasn\u2019t to be; God had other plans.</p><p>In any event, this is a special birthday and we should celebrate. Traveling isn\u2019t as easy for me as it once was, and I suspect it isn\u2019t for you, either, so that trip we always talked about\u2014the three of us going to Hawaii and Hong Kong\u2014is out. But we\u2019re not dead yet! I\u2019ve still got some spring to my step and so do you! However, I doubt either of us could keep up with Clara.</p><p>What would you think if I booked us on the passenger ferry up to Victoria, British Columbia? It\u2019s spectacular there this time of year. We could stay at the Empress Hotel and tour Butchart Gardens. The hotel is lovely, and their high tea is not to be missed. I\u2019ve already written Clara and suggested the three of us go there together. How does that sound? I\u2019ll wait to hear back from you before I make the hotel reservations.</p><p>I wanted to ask your impression of how Clara\u2019s doing. Losing one\u2019s life mate is devastating. It hurts so terribly, as you and I both know. Although it\u2019s been nearly twenty years since Sam died, he\u2019s still with me...still a part of me. I know you understand what I\u2019m trying to say. Those first few weeks I was numb, and I know Clara probably is, too. I\u2019m thankful her family\u2019s close by.</p><p>You asked about Ruth. Yes, my granddaughter\u2019s still living in Seattle, attending the University of Washington and working toward her master\u2019s in education. I was thrilled when I learned that she\u2019d chosen to finish her schooling in Washington State in order to be closer to me. She\u2019s very good about staying in touch but can\u2019t visit as frequently as we\u2019d both hoped. I\u2019ll give her a call next week and see if she can come to Cedar Cove for lunch. Ruth is a delightful child. Grandchildren are indeed a blessing. How fortunate you are to have three granddaughters. Three! Ruth is my only one and I feel especially close to her\u2014and she to me.</p><p>Do get in touch soon, and let me know if you can manage a trip to Victoria in June. The three of us will have a grand time! And since you\u2019re the youngest, Clara and I will expect you to carry the luggage.</p><p>Much love,</p><p>Helen</p><p>One</p><p>Ruth Shelton hurried out of her classroom-management lecture at the University of Washington, where she was completing her master\u2019s of education degree. Clutching her books, she dashed across campus, in a rush to get home. By now the mail would have been delivered to her small rental house three blocks from the school.</p><p>\u201cRuth,\u201d Lori Dupont called, stopping her in the hallway just outside the door. \u201cThere\u2019s another antiwar rally this afternoon at\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve got to run,\u201d Ruth said, flying past her friend and feeling more than a little guilty. Other students cleared a path for her; wherever she was headed must have seemed urgent\u2014and it was, but only to her. Since Christmas, four months ago, she\u2019d been corresponding with Sergeant Paul Gordon, USMC, who was stationed in Afghanistan. There\u2019d been recent reports of fighting, and she hadn\u2019t received a letter or an e-mail from Paul in three days. Three interminable days. Not since they\u2019d initially begun their correspondence had there been such a lapse. Paul usually wrote every day and she did, too. They e-mailed as often as possible. Ruth had strong feelings about the war in Iraq, although her opinions didn\u2019t match those of her parents, who endorsed this undeclared war.</p><p>Earlier in the school year, Ruth had been part of a protest rally on campus. But no matter what her political views on the subject, she felt it was important to support American troops wherever they might be serving. In an effort to do that, Ruth had voluntarily mailed a Christmas card and letter to a nameless soldier.</p><p>Paul Gordon was the young man who\u2019d received that Christmas card, and to Ruth\u2019s surprise he\u2019d written her back and enclosed his photograph. Paul was from Seattle and he\u2019d chosen her card because of the Seattle postmark. He\u2019d asked her lots of questions\u2014about her history, her family, her interests\u2014and closed with a postscript that said he hoped to hear from her again.</p><p>When she first got his letter, Ruth had hesitated. She felt she\u2019d done her duty, supported the armed services in a way she was comfortable doing. This man she\u2019d never met was asking her to continue writing him. She wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to become that involved. Feeling uncertain, she\u2019d waited a few days before deciding.</p><p>During that time, Ruth had read and reread his letter and studied the head shot of the clean-cut handsome marine sergeant in dress uniform. His dark brown eyes had seemed to stare straight through her\u2014and directly into her heart. After two days, she answered his letter with a short one of her own and added her e-mail address at the bottom of the page. Ruth had a few concerns she wanted him to address before she could commit herself to beginning this correspondence. Being as straightforward and honest as possible, she explained her strong feelings against the war in Iraq. She felt there was a more legitimate reason for troops to be in Afghanistan and wanted to know his stand. A few days later he e-mailed her. Paul didn\u2019t mince words. He told her he believed the United States had done the right thing in entering Iraq and gave his reasons. He left it up to her to decide if she wanted to continue their correspondence. Ruth e-mailed him back and once again listed her objections to the American presence in the Middle East. His response came a day later, suggesting they \u201cagree to disagree.\u201d He ended the e-mail with the same question he\u2019d asked her earlier. Would she write him?</p><p>At first, Ruth had decided not to. They were diametrically opposed in their political views. But in the end, even recognizing the conflict between their opinions, she did write. Their correspondence started slowly. She enjoyed his wry wit and his unflinching determination to make a difference in the world. His father had fought in Vietnam, he said, and in some ways this war seemed similar\u2014the hostile terrain, the unpredictability of the enemy, the unpleasant conditions. For her part, she mentioned that at twenty-five she\u2019d returned to school to obtain her master\u2019s of education degree. Then, gradually, without being fully aware of how it had happened, Ruth found herself spending part of every day writing or e-mailing Paul.</p><p>After they\u2019d been corresponding regularly for a couple of months, Paul asked for her picture. Eventually she\u2019d mailed him her photograph, but only after she\u2019d had her hair and makeup done at one of those \u201cglamour\u201d studios. Although she wasn\u2019t fashion-model beautiful, she considered herself fairly attractive and wanted to look her absolute best for Paul. Already he was becoming important to her. For years, she\u2019d been resigned to the fact that she wasn\u2019t much good at relationships. In high school she\u2019d been shy, and while she was an undergraduate, she\u2019d dated a little but tended to be reserved and studious. Her quiet manner didn\u2019t seem to appeal to the guys she met. It was only when she stepped in front of a classroom that she truly came out of her shell. She loved teaching, every single aspect of it. In the process, Ruth lost her hesitation and her restraint, and to her astonishment discovered that this enthusiasm had begun to spill over into the rest of her life. Suddenly men started to notice her. She enjoyed the attention\u2014who wouldn\u2019t?\u2014and had dated more in the past few months than in the preceding four years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the picture, her short brown hair had been styled in loose curls. Her dark-brown eyes were smiling and friendly, which was exactly the impression she hoped to convey. She was a little shocked by the importance of Paul\u2019s reaction\u2014by her need that he find her attractive.</p><p>She waited impatiently for his response. A week later she received an e-mail. Paul seemed to like what he saw in her photograph and they were soon writing and e-mailing back and forth at a feverish pace. A day without some form of communication from Paul felt empty now.</p><p>Ruth had never had a long-distance relationship before, and the intensity of her feelings for this man she\u2019d never met took her by surprise. She wasn\u2019t a teenager with a schoolgirl crush. Ruth was a mature, responsible adult. Or at least she had been until she slipped a simple Christmas card into the mailbox\u2014and got a reply from a handsome marine sergeant named Paul Gordon.</p><p>Ruth walked quickly to the tiny rental house she shared with Lynn Blumenthal, then ran up the front steps to the porch. Lynn was eighteen and away from home and family for the first time. The arrangement suited them both, and despite the disparity in their ages and interests, they\u2019d gotten along fairly well. With her heart pounding hard, Ruth forced herself to draw in a deep breath as she started toward the mailbox.</p> <p>The screen door flew open and Lynn came out. \u201cWhat are you doing home?\u201d she asked, then shook her head. \u201cNever mind, I already know. You\u2019re looking for a letter from soldier boy.\u201d</p><p>Ruth wasn\u2019t going to deny the obvious. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard from him in three days.\u201d</p><p>Lynn rolled her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Ruth didn\u2019t want to get into another detailed discussion with her roommate. Lynn had made her feelings known about this relationship from the first, although as Ruth had gently tried to tell her, it was none of her business. That didn\u2019t prevent the younger woman from expressing her views. Lynn said that Ruth was only setting herself up for heartache. A part of Ruth actually agreed, but by the time she realized what was happening, she was emotionally involved with Paul.</p><p>\u201cYou hardly ever see Clay anymore,\u201d Lynn chastised, hands on her hips. \u201cHe called and asked about you the other night.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth stared at the small black mailbox. Depending on his assignment duty, Paul didn\u2019t always have computer access and sometimes wrote letters instead. \u201cClay and I are just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to him.\u201d</p><p>It was true that they\u2019d been seeing each other a lot following a Halloween party last October. Like her, Clay Matthews was obtaining his master\u2019s of education, and they seemed to have a lot in common. But her interest in him had already started to wane before she\u2019d mailed that Christmas card to Paul. The problem was, Clay hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he\u2019s disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClay is decent and hardworking and I think the way you\u2019ve treated him the last few months is...is terrible.\u201d Lynn, who at five foot ten stood a good seven inches taller than Ruth, could be intimidating, especially with her mouth twisted in that grimace of disapproval.</p><p>Ruth had tried to let Clay down easily, but it hadn\u2019t worked. They\u2019d gone to the library together last Thursday. Unfortunately, that had been a mistake. She\u2019d known it almost right away when Clay pressured her to have coffee with him afterward. It would\u2019ve been better to end the relationship entirely and forget about staying friends. He was younger, for one thing, and while that hadn\u2019t seemed important earlier, it did now. Perhaps it was wrong to compare him to Paul, but Ruth couldn\u2019t help it. Measured against Paul, Clay seemed immature, demanding and insecure.</p> <p>\u201cYou said he phoned?\u201d Frowning, she glanced at Lynn.</p><p>Lynn nodded. \u201cHe wants to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Oh, brother! Ruth couldn\u2019t have made it plainer had she handed him divorce papers. Unwilling to be cruel, she\u2019d tried to bolster his ego by referring to all the positive aspects of his personality\u2014but apparently, that had only led him to think the opposite of what she was trying to tell him. He\u2019d refused to take her very obvious hints, and in her frustration, she\u2019d bluntly announced that she wasn\u2019t interested in seeing him anymore. That seemed pretty clear-cut to her; how he could be confused about it left Ruth shaking her head.</p><p>The fact that he\u2019d phoned and cried on her roommate\u2019s shoulder was a good example of what she found adolescent about his behavior. She was absolutely certain Paul would never do that. If he had a problem, he\u2019d take it directly to the source.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re being foolish,\u201d Lynn said, and added, \u201cNot that you asked my opinion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Ruth reminded her, eyeing the mailbox again. There was an ornamental latticework design along the bottom, and looking through it, she could tell that the day\u2019s mail had been delivered. The envelope inside was white, and her spirits sank. There just had to be something from Paul. If not a real letter, then an e-mail.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to talk to you,\u201d Lynn was saying.</p><p>\u201cWho did?\u201d Ruth asked distractedly. She was dying to open the mailbox, but she wanted to do it in privacy.</p> <p>\u201cClay,\u201d Lynn cried, sounding completely exasperated. \u201cWho else are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Ruth understood. She looked away from the mailbox and focused her attention on Lynn. \u201cYou\u2019re attracted to him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Lynn gasped indignantly. \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Ruth said, gesturing toward the front steps where they\u2019d often sat before. It was a lovely spring afternoon, the first week of April, and she needed to clear the air with her roommate before this got further out of hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lynn said with a defensive edge. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the wrong idea here. I was just trying to help a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Ruth ordered.</p><p>\u201cI have class in twenty minutes and I\u2014\u201d Lynn paused, frowning at her watch.</p><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>The eighteen-year-old capitulated with ill grace. \u201cAll right, but I already know what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d She folded her arms and stared straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with it,\u201d Ruth said softly. \u201cGo out with him if you want. Like I said earlier, I\u2019m not interested in Clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be if it wasn\u2019t for soldier boy.\u201d</p><p>Ruth considered that and in all honesty felt she could say, \u201cNot so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you,\u201d Lynn lamented a second time. \u201cYou marched in the rally against the war in Iraq. Afghanistan isn\u2019t all that different, and now you\u2019re involved with Paul what\u2019s-his-face and it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even know you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does,\u201d Lynn insisted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to have this conversation with you. We agree on some points and disagree on others. That\u2019s fine. We live in a free society and we don\u2019t have to have the same opinion on these issues or anything else.\u201d</p><p>Lynn sighed and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI have the feeling none of this is really about Paul,\u201d Ruth said with deliberate patience. She hadn\u2019t known Lynn long; they lived separate lives and so far they\u2019d never had a problem. As far as roommates went, Ruth felt she was fortunate to have found someone as amicable as Lynn. She didn\u2019t want this difference of opinion about Clay\u2014and Paul\u2014to ruin that.</p><p>The other girl once again looked pointedly at her watch, as if to suggest Ruth say what she intended to say and be done with it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see Clay.\u201d She couldn\u2019t make it any more explicit than that.</p><p>\u201cYou might have told him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d</p><p>Lynn glared at her. \u201cYou should\u2019ve tried harder.\u201d</p><p>Ruth laughed, but not because she was amused. For whatever reason, Clay had set his sights on her and wasn\u2019t about to be dissuaded. Complicating matters, Lynn was obviously interested in him and feeling guilty and unsure of how to respond to her attraction.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt Clay. He\u2019s a great guy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have lied to him.\u201d</p><p>Ruth raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhen did I lie to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast week you said you were going to visit your grandmother in Cedar Cove and that was why you couldn\u2019t go out with him this weekend. I overheard you,\u201d she added.</p><p>Oh, that. \u201cIt was a white lie,\u201d Ruth confessed. She definitely planned to visit her grandmother, though. Helen Shelton lived across Puget Sound in a small community on the Kitsap Peninsula. Ruth had spent Thanksgiving with her grandmother and visited for a weekend before Christmas and then again close to Valentine\u2019s Day. Her last visit had been early in March. She always enjoyed her time with Helen, but somehow the weeks had slipped away and here it was April already.</p><p>\u201cA lie is a lie,\u201d Lynn said adamantly.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re right,\u201d Ruth agreed. \u201cI should\u2019ve been honest with Clay.\u201d Delaying had been a mistake, as she was now learning.</p><p>That seemed to satisfy her roommate, who started to get to her feet. Ruth placed her hand on Lynn\u2019s forearm, stopping her. \u201cI want to know why you\u2019re so upset about this situation with Clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already told you.... I just don\u2019t think this is how people should treat each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the way Clay\u2019s put you in the middle. This is between him and me. He had no right to drag you into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re defending him?\u201d</p><p>Lynn shrugged. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Clay\u2019s a big boy. If he has something to say, then he can come to me all on his own. When and if he does, I\u2019m going to tell him again that I\u2019m no longer interested in dating him. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuck on some gun-wielding\u2014\u201d</p><p>A look from Ruth cut her off.</p><p>\u201cOkay, whatever,\u201d Lynn muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want you to do is comfort him,\u201d Ruth said, patting Lynn\u2019s forearm.</p><p>\u201cI could, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ruth said, hoping to encourage her. \u201cHe might need someone to talk to, and since you\u2019re sensitive to his feelings, you\u2019d be an excellent choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>Ruth nodded and then Lynn stood up. She went inside to get her books and left with a cheerful goodbye as if they\u2019d never had an argument. With her roommate gone, Ruth leaped off the step and across the porch to the mailbox. Lifting the top, she reached inside, holding her breath as she pulled out the electric bill in its white envelope, a sales flyer\u2014and a hand-addressed air mail letter from Sergeant Paul Gordon.</p><p>Two</p><p>April 6</p><p>My Dear Ruth, We\u2019ve been out on a recon mission for the last four days and there wasn\u2019t any way I could let you know. They seemed like the longest four days of this tour, and not for the reasons you might think. Those days meant I couldn\u2019t write you or receive your letters. I\u2019ve been in the marines for eight years now and I\u2019ve never felt like this about mail before. Never felt this strongly about a woman I\u2019ve yet to meet, either. Once we were back in camp, I sat down with your letters and read through each one. As I explained before, there are times we can\u2019t get on-line and this happened to be one of those times. I realize you\u2019ve probably been wondering why I wasn\u2019t in touch. I hope you weren\u2019t too concerned. I would\u2019ve written if I could. I have good news. I\u2019m coming home on leave.... Ruth read Paul\u2019s letter twice. Yes, he\u2019d definitely said he was headed home, to Seattle, for two weeks before flying to Camp Pendleton in California for additional training. He was looking forward to spending most of his leave with her. His one request was that Ruth make as much time for him as her studies would allow and, if possible, keep her weekends free. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If Ruth thought her heart had been beating hard a few minutes earlier, it didn\u2019t compare to the way it pounded now. She could barely breathe. Never had she looked forward to meeting anyone more.</p><p>Sitting on the edge of her bed in her tiny room, Ruth picked up the small framed photograph she kept on her nightstand. Paul\u2019s image was the first thing she saw when she woke and the last before she turned off her light. In four months, he\u2019d become an important part of her life. Now, with his return to Seattle, their feelings for each other would stand the real test. Writing letters and e-mail messages was very different from carrying on a face-to-face conversation. At the same time, Ruth was afraid. She feared their differing views on the war in Iraq would come between them. She feared, too, that if he was being sent for additional training, he might soon be stationed there.</p><p>At the end of his letter, Paul suggested they meet at 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, April 17, at Ivar\u2019s restaurant on the Seattle waterfront. She didn\u2019t care what else was on her schedule; any conflicting arrangement would immediately be canceled.</p><p>Rather than begin her homework, Ruth sat down and wrote Paul back, her fingers flying over the computer keys as she composed her response. Yes, she would meet him. Nothing would keep her away. While she was nervous at the prospect of meeting Paul, she was excited, too.</p> <p>Her letter was coming out of the printer when the phone rang. Absently Ruth grabbed the receiver, holding it against her shoulder as she opened the desk drawer and searched for an envelope.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth, it\u2019s your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d Ruth said, genuinely pleased to hear from Helen. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to call you and I haven\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother chuckled. \u201cI didn\u2019t call to make you feel guilty. I\u2019m inviting you to lunch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a couple of weeks\u2014on Sunday the seventeenth if that works for you. I figured I\u2019d give you plenty of time to fit me into your schedule. I thought we\u2019d sit out on the patio, weather permitting, and enjoy the view of the cove.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s duplex was on a hill overlooking the water with the lighthouse in the distance. Her grandparents had lived in Cedar Cove for as long as Ruth could remember. Because she\u2019d been born and raised in Oregon, Ruth had visited the small Washington town often through the years. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to get over to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, but unless we both plan ahead, it won\u2019t happen. In no time you\u2019ll have your master\u2019s degree and then you\u2019ll move on and we\u2019ll both regret the missed opportunities. I don\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t, either.\u201d Her Grandma Shelton was Ruth\u2019s favorite relative. She was well educated, which wasn\u2019t particularly common for a woman her age, and spoke French and German fluently. Her father hadn\u2019t said much about his mother\u2019s life prior to her marriage, and one of the reasons Ruth had chosen to attend the University of Washington was so she could get to know her grandmother better.</p><p>\u201cI can put you down for lunch, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, that would be perfect.\u201d Her gaze fell on Paul\u2019s letter and Ruth realized that the date her grandmother had suggested was the first weekend Paul would be in town. He\u2019d specifically asked her to keep as much of that two-week period free as she could. She wanted to spend time with him and yet she couldn\u2019t refuse her grandmother. \u201cGrandma, I\u2019m looking at my calendar and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a conflict?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot...exactly. I\u2019ve sort of got a date,\u201d she said, assuming she and Paul would be seeing each other. It would be ideal if he could join her. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anything official, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do have something scheduled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d This was getting complicated.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware that you were dating anyone special. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>The question hung there for a moment before Ruth answered. \u201cHis name is Paul Gordon and we aren\u2019t really dating.\u201d She would\u2019ve explained, except that her grandmother broke in again.</p><p>\u201cYour parents didn\u2019t say anything about this.\u201d The words were spoken as if there must be something untoward about Paul that Ruth didn\u2019t want to divulge.</p> <p>\u201cNo, Mom and Dad wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Ruth muttered, not adding that she hadn\u2019t actually mentioned Paul to her parents. She\u2019d decided it wasn\u2019t necessary to enlighten them about this correspondence yet. Explaining her feelings about Paul to her family would be difficult when everyone knew her stand on the war. More importantly, she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about him and wouldn\u2019t be until they\u2019d met.</p><p>So far, they were only pen pals, but this was the man she dreamed about every night, the man who dominated her thoughts each and every day.</p><p>\u201cGrandma, I haven\u2019t said anything to Mom and Dad because I haven\u2019t officially met Paul yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this...\u201d Her grandmother hesitated. \u201cIs this one of those...those Internet relationships?\u201d She spit out the word as though meeting a man via the Internet was either illegal or unseemly\u2014and probably both.</p><p>\u201cNo, Grandma, it\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t your parents know about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, because...because he\u2019s a soldier in Afghanistan.\u201d There\u2014it was out.</p><p>Her announcement was met with silence. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with that?\u201d Helen eventually asked.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say it like you\u2019re ashamed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed,\u201d Ruth insisted. \u201cI like Paul a great deal and I\u2019m proud of his service to our country.\u201d She downplayed her political beliefs as she expanded on her feelings. \u201cI enjoy his letters and like him more than I probably should, but I don\u2019t like the fact that he\u2019s a soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound confused.\u201d</p><p>Ruth sighed. That was certainly an accurate description of how she felt.</p><p>\u201cSo this Paul will be in Seattle on leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. For two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming here to meet you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis family also lives in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInvite him along for lunch,\u201d her grandmother said. \u201cI want to meet him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Ruth\u2019s enthusiasm swelled. \u201cThat\u2019s great. I wanted to, but I wasn\u2019t sure how you\u2019d feel about having him join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant what I said. I want to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only been writing for a few months. I don\u2019t know him well, and...\u201d She let the rest fade.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Ruth,\u201d her grandmother assured her. Helen always seemed to know what Ruth was feeling and thinking. She\u2019d found ways to encourage the special bond between them.</p><p>\u201cGrandpa was a soldier when you first met him, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d Ruth remembered her father telling her this years ago, although he\u2019d also said his mother didn\u2019t like to talk about those years. Ruth assumed that was because of Grandpa Sam\u2019s bad memories of the war, the awful things he\u2019d seen and experienced in Europe. She knew her grandparents had met during the Second World War, fallen in love and married soon afterward. Ruth\u2019s father had been born in the baby boom years that followed World War II, and her uncle Jake had arrived two years later. Ruth was Helen\u2019s only granddaughter, but she had three grandsons.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d She sighed wistfully. \u201cMy Sam was so handsome, especially in his uniform.\u201d Her voice softened perceptibly.</p><p>\u201cHow long did you know him before you were married?\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother laughed. \u201cLess than a year. In wartime everything\u2019s very intense. People married quickly because you never knew if you\u2019d still be alive tomorrow. It was as if those of us who were young had to cram as much life into as short a time as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe war was terrible, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother hesitated before whispering, \u201cAll war is terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Ruth said promptly.</p><p>\u201cSo you and this soldier you\u2019ve never met are discussing marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ruth nearly choked getting out her denial. \u201cPaul and me? No, of course not. I promise you the subject has never even come up.\u201d They hadn\u2019t written about kissing or touching or exchanged the conventional romantic endearments. That didn\u2019t mean she hadn\u2019t dreamed about what it would be like to be held by Paul Gordon. To kiss him and be caressed by him. She\u2019d let her imagination roam free....</p><p>\u201cSo you say,\u201d her grandmother said with amusement in her voice. \u201cBy all means, bring your friend. I\u2019ll look forward to meeting him.\u201d</p><p>That was no doubt true, Ruth thought, but no one looked forward to meeting Paul Gordon more than she did.</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Ruth asked her roommate. She hated to sound so insecure, but this was perhaps the most important meeting of her life and Ruth was determined to make a perfect impression.</p><p>\u201cFabulous,\u201d Lynn muttered, her face hidden behind the latest issue of People magazine.</p><p>\u201cI might believe you if you actually looked at me,\u201d Ruth said, holding on to her patience with limited success. The relationship with her roommate had gone steadily downhill since the confrontation on the porch steps two weeks earlier. Apparently Clay wasn\u2019t interested in dating Lynn. What Ruth did know was that Clay hadn\u2019t contacted her since, and her roommate had been increasingly cold and standoffish. Ruth had tried to talk to her but that hadn\u2019t done any good. She suspected that Lynn wanted to be upset, so Ruth had decided to go about her own business and ignore her roommate\u2019s disgruntled mood. This might not be the best strategy, but it was the only way she could deal with Lynn\u2019s attitude.</p><p>Her roommate heaved a sigh; apparently lifting her head a couple of inches required immense effort. Her eyes were devoid of emotion as she gave Ruth a token appraisal. \u201cYou look all right, I guess.\u201d</p><p>That was high praise coming from Lynn. Ruth had spent an hour doing her hair, with the help of a curling iron and two brushes. And now it was raining like crazy. This wasn\u2019t the drizzle traditionally associated with the Pacific Northwest, either. This was rain. Real rain. Which spelled disaster for her hair, since her umbrella wouldn\u2019t afford much protection.</p><p>If her hair had taken a long time, choosing what to wear had demanded equal consideration. She had a lovely teal-and-white summer dress from last year that made her eyes look dark and dreamy, but the rain had altered that plan. Now she was wearing black pants and a white cashmere sweater with a beige overcoat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re meeting at Ivar\u2019s, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Ruth didn\u2019t remember telling her roommate. They were barely on speaking terms.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad what?\u201d Ruth demanded.</p><p>Lynn sighed once more and set aside the magazine. \u201cIf you must know, soldier boy phoned and said you should meet him outside the restaurant.\u201d She grinned nastily. \u201cAnd in case you haven\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s pouring out.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to meet him outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said.\u201d</p><p>Ruth made an effort not to snap at her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think to mention this before now?\u201d</p><p>Lynn shrugged. \u201cIt slipped my mind.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth just bet it did. Rather than start an argument, she collected her raincoat, umbrella and purse. Surely she would receive a heavenly reward for controlling her temper. Lynn would love an argument but Ruth wasn\u2019t going to give her one; she wasn\u2019t going to play those kinds of childish games with her roommate. The difference in their ages had never seemed more pronounced than it had in the past two weeks.</p><p>Because of the rain, Ruth couldn\u2019t find convenient street parking and was forced to pay an outrageous amount at a lot near the restaurant. She rushed toward Ivar\u2019s, making sure she arrived in plenty of time to meet Paul by six. Lynn\u2019s sour disposition might have upset Ruth if not for the fact that she was finally going to meet the soldier who\u2019d come to mean so much to her.</p><p>Focusing on her hair, dress and makeup meant she\u2019d paid almost no attention to something that was far more important\u2014what she\u2019d actually say when she saw Paul for the first time. Ideas skittered through her mind as she crossed the street.</p><p>Ruth hoped to sound witty, articulate and well informed. She so badly wanted to impress Paul and was afraid she\u2019d stumble over her words or find herself speechless. Her other fear was that she\u2019d take one look at him and humiliate herself by bursting into tears. It could happen; she felt very emotional about meeting this man she\u2019d known only through letters and e-mails.</p><p>Thankfully, by the time she reached Ivar\u2019s, the rain had slowed to a drizzle. But it was still wet out and miserably gray. Her curls, which had been perfectly styled, had turned into tight wads of frizz in the humid air. She was sure she resembled a cartoon character more than the fashion model she\u2019d strived for earlier that afternoon.</p> <p>After the longest ten-minute wait of her life, Ruth checked her watch and saw that it was now one minute past six. Paul was late. She pulled her cell phone from her bag; unfortunately Paul didn\u2019t have a cell, so she punched out her home number. Perhaps he\u2019d been delayed in traffic and called the house, hoping to connect with her.</p><p>No answer. Either Lynn had left or purposely chose not to pick up the receiver. Great, just great.</p><p>To her dismay, as she went to toss her cell phone back inside her purse, she realized the battery was low. Why hadn\u2019t she charged it? Oh, no, that would\u2019ve been much too smart.</p><p>All at once Ruth figured it out. Paul wasn\u2019t late at all. Somehow she\u2019d missed him, which wouldn\u2019t be that difficult with all the tourist traffic on the waterfront. Even in the rain, people milled around the area as if they were on the sunny beaches of Hawaii. Someone needed to explain to these tourists that the water dripping down from the sky was cold rain. Just because they\u2019d dressed for the sunshine didn\u2019t mean the weather would cooperate.</p><p>By now her hair hung in tight ringlets all around her head. Either of two things had happened, she speculated. First, her appearance was so drastically changed from that glamour photo she\u2019d sent him that Paul hadn\u2019t recognized her and assumed she\u2019d stood him up. The other possibility was even less appealing. Paul had gotten a glimpse of her and decided to escape without saying a word.</p><p>For a moment Ruth felt like crying. Rather than waste the last of her cell phone battery phoning her roommate again, she stepped inside the restaurant to see if Paul had left a message for her.</p> <p>She opened the door and lowered her umbrella. As she did, she saw a tall, lean and very handsome Paul Gordon get up from a chair in the restaurant foyer.</p><p>\u201cRuth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaul?\u201d Without a thought, she dropped the umbrella and moved directly into his embrace.</p><p>Then they were in each other\u2019s arms, hugging fiercely.</p><p>When it became obvious that everyone in the crowded foyer was staring at them, Paul reluctantly let her go.</p><p>\u201cI was outside\u2014didn\u2019t you tell Lynn that\u2019s where we were meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He brushed the wet curls from her forehead and smiled down at her. \u201cI said inside because I heard on the weather forecast that it was going to rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, of course.\u201d Ruth wanted to kick herself for being so dense. She should\u2019ve guessed what Lynn was up to; instead, she\u2019d fallen right into her roommate\u2019s petty hands. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to keep you waiting.\u201d</p> <p>A number of people were still watching them but Ruth didn\u2019t care. She couldn\u2019t stop looking at Paul. He seemed unable to break eye contact with her, too.</p><p>The hostess came forward. \u201cSince your party\u2019s arrived,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201cI can seat you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d Paul helped Ruth off with her coat and set the umbrella aside so it could dry. Then, as if they\u2019d known and loved each other all their lives, he reached for her hand and linked her fingers with his as they walked through the restaurant.</p><p>The hostess seated them by the window, which overlooked the dark, murky waters of Puget Sound. Rain ran in rivulets down the tempered glass, but it could have been the brightest, sunniest day in Seattle\u2019s history for all the notice Ruth paid.</p><p>Paul continued to hold her hand on top of the table.</p><p>\u201cI was worried about what I\u2019d say once we met,\u201d she said. \u201cThen when we did, I was just so glad, the words didn\u2019t seem important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d almost convinced myself you\u2019d stood me up.\u201d He yawned, covering his mouth with the other hand, and she realized he was probably functioning on next to no sleep.</p><p>\u201cStood you up? I would\u2019ve found a way to get here no matter what.\u201d She let the truth of that show in her eyes. She had the strongest feeling of certainty, and an involuntary sense that he was everything she\u2019d dreamed.</p><p>He briefly looked away. \u201cI would\u2019ve found a way to get to you, too.\u201d His fingers tightened around hers.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last sleep?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His mouth curved upward in a half smile. \u201cI forget. A long time ago. I probably should\u2019ve suggested we meet tomorrow, but I didn\u2019t want to wait a minute longer than I had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither,\u201d she confessed.</p><p>He smiled again, that wonderful, intoxicating smile.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you land?\u201d she asked, because if she didn\u2019t stop staring at him she was going to embarrass herself.</p><p>\u201cLate this morning,\u201d he told her. \u201cMy family\u2014well, you know what families are like. Mom\u2019s been cooking for days and there was a big family get-together this afternoon. I wanted to invite you but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I understand. You couldn\u2019t because\u2014well, how could you?\u201d That didn\u2019t come out right, but Paul seemed to know what she was trying to say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exactly like I pictured you,\u201d he said, and his eyes softened as he touched her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou imagined me drenched?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI imagined you beautiful, and you are.\u201d</p><p>His words made her blush. \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time believing you\u2019re actually here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>The waitress came for their drink order. Ruth hadn\u2019t even looked at her menu or thought about what she\u2019d like to drink. Because she was wet and chilled, she ordered hot tea and Paul asked for a bottle of champagne.</p><p>\u201cWe have reason to celebrate,\u201d he announced. Then, as if it had suddenly occurred to him, he said, \u201cYou do drink alcohol, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded quickly. \u201cNormally I would\u2019ve asked for wine, but I wanted the tea so I could warm up. I haven\u2019t decided what to order yet.\u201d She picked up the menu and scanned the entr\u00e9es.</p><p>The waitress brought the champagne and standing ice bucket to the table. \u201cIs there something special you\u2019re celebrating?\u201d she asked in a friendly voice.</p><p>Paul nodded and his eyes met Ruth\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating the fact that we found each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d She removed the foil top and wire around the cork and opened the bottle with a slight popping sound. After filling the two champagne flutes, she left.</p><p>Ruth took her glass. \u201cOnce again, I\u2019m so sorry about what happened. Let me pay for the champagne, please. You wouldn\u2019t have had a problem finding me if I\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about this evening,\u201d he broke in. \u201cI was talking about your Christmas card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Paul raised his glass; she raised hers, too, and they clicked the rims gently together. \u201cDo you believe in fate?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ruth smiled. \u201cI didn\u2019t, but I\u2019ve had a change of heart since Christmas.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was marvelous. Ruth didn\u2019t remember what she\u2019d ordered or anything else about the actual meal. For all she knew, she could\u2019ve been dining on raw seaweed. It hardly mattered.</p><p>They talked and talked, and she felt as if she\u2019d known Paul her entire life. He asked detailed questions about her family, her studies, her plans after graduation, and seemed genuinely interested in everything she said. He talked about the marines and Afghanistan with a sense of pride at the positive differences he\u2019d seen in the country. After dinner and dessert, they lingered over coffee and at nine-thirty Paul paid the tab and suggested they walk along the waterfront.</p><p>The clouds had drifted away and the moon was glowing, its light splashing against the pier as they strolled hand in hand. Although she knew Paul had to be exhausted from his long flight and the family gathering, she couldn\u2019t deny herself these last few minutes.</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to keep the weekends free,\u201d Ruth murmured, resting her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNot tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a date with some other guy?\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in order to study his face, trying to discern whether he was serious. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d she murmured hesitantly.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYes and no. You have no obligation to me and vice versa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His response was immediate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, either,\u201d she told him. She wanted to ask how he could even think that she would be. \u201cI promised my grandmother I\u2019d visit tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour grandmother?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cShe invited you, too.\u201d</p><p>He arched his brows.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, she insisted I bring you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve mentioned me to your family.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d told him in her letters that she hadn\u2019t. \u201cJust her\u2014she\u2019s special. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy meeting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Paul turned Ruth into his arms and stared down at her. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could stay away.\u201d</p><p>And then he kissed her. Ruth had fantasized about this moment for months. She\u2019d wondered what it would be like when Paul kissed her, but nothing she\u2019d conjured up equaled this reality. Never in all her twenty-five years had she experienced anything close to the sensation she felt when Paul\u2019s mouth descended on hers. Stars fell from the sky. She saw it happen even with her eyes tightly closed. She heard triumphant music nearby; it seemed to surround her. But once she opened her eyes, all the stars seemed to be exactly where they\u2019d been before. And the music came from somebody\u2019s car radio. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Paul wore a stunned look.</p><p>\u201cThat was...very nice,\u201d Ruth managed after a moment.</p><p>Paul nodded in agreement, then cleared his throat. \u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I admit I was afraid of what would happen when we met?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cAfraid why? Of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d He slid his hand down her spine and moved a step away from her. \u201cI\u2019d built up this meeting in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI was so afraid you could never live up to my image of you,\u201d Paul told her. \u201cI figured we could meet and I\u2019d get you out of my system. I\u2019d buy you dinner, thank you for your letters and e-mails\u2014and that would be the end of it. No woman could possibly be everything I\u2019d envisioned you to be. But you are, Ruth, you are.\u201d</p> <p>Although the wind and rain were chilly, his words were enough to warm her from head to foot.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe you could be what I\u2019d imagined, either, and I was right,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d He seemed crestfallen.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cPaul, you\u2019re even more wonderful than I\u2019d realized.\u201d At his relieved expression, she said, \u201cI underestimated how strong my feelings for you are. Look at me, I\u2019m shaking.\u201d She held out her hand as evidence of how badly she was trembling after his kiss.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve been in life-and-death situations and I didn\u2019t flinch. Now, one evening with you and my stomach\u2019s full of butterflies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lack of sleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, and took her by the shoulders. \u201cThat was what your kiss did to me.\u201d His eyes glittered as he stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d she asked uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one with reservations about falling for a guy in the service.\u201d</p><p>Her early letters had often referred to her feelings about exactly that. Ruth lowered her gaze. \u201cThe fundamental problem hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll eventually get out, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, and his dark eyes\u2014which had been so warm seconds before\u2014seemed to be closing her out. \u201cEventually I\u2019ll leave the marines, but you should know it won\u2019t be anytime in the near future. I\u2019m in for the long haul, and if you want to continue this relationship, the sooner you accept that, the better.\u201d</p><p>Ruth didn\u2019t want their evening to end on a negative note. When she\u2019d answered his letter that first time, she\u2019d known he was a military man and it hadn\u2019t stopped her. She\u2019d gone into this with her eyes wide open. \u201cI don\u2019t have to decide right away, do I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said, cutting him off. She couldn\u2019t allow their differences to come between them so quickly. She sensed that Paul, too, wanted to push all that aside. When she slid her arms around his waist and hugged him, he hugged her back. \u201cYou\u2019re exhausted. Let\u2019s meet in the morning. I\u2019ll take you over to visit my grandmother and we can talk some more then.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth rested her head against his shoulder again and Paul kissed her hair. \u201cYou\u2019re making this difficult,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Ruth realized they\u2019d need to confront the issue soon. She could also see that settling it wasn\u2019t going to be as easy as she\u2019d hoped.</p><p>Four</p><p>Paul met Ruth at the Seattle terminal at ten the following morning and they walked up the ramp to board the Bremerton ferry. The hard rain of the night before had yielded to glorious sunshine.</p><p>Unlike the previous evening, when Paul and Ruth had talked nonstop through a three-hour dinner, it seemed that now they had little to say. The one big obstacle in their relationship hung between them. They sat side by side on the wooden bench and sipped hot coffee as the ferry eased away from the Seattle dock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still thinking about last night, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Ruth said, carefully broaching the subject after a lengthy silence. \u201cAbout you being in the military, I mean, and my objections to the war in Iraq?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s the political aspect and also the fact that you don\u2019t seem comfortable with the concept of military life,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, really, but we\u2019ll work it out,\u201d she assured him, and reached for his free hand, entwining their fingers. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t look as if he believed her. But after a couple of moments, he seemed to come to some sort of decision. He brought her hand to his lips. \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy the time we have today, all right?\u201d</p><p>Ruth smiled in agreement.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Ruth was more than willing to change the subject. \u201cThis is my paternal grandmother, and she\u2019s lived in Cedar Cove for the past thirty years. She and my grandfather moved there from Seattle after he retired because they wanted a slower pace of life. I barely remember my grandfather Sam. He died when I was two, before I had any real memories of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died young,\u201d Paul commented sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cYes...My grandmother\u2019s been alone for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably has good friends in a town like Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s still got friends she\u2019s had since the war. It\u2019s something I admire about my grandmother,\u201d she continued. \u201cNot only because she speaks three languages fluently and is one of the most intelligent women I know. She\u2019s my inspiration. Ever since I can remember, she\u2019s been helping others. Even though she\u2019s in her eighties, Grandma\u2019s involved with all kinds of charities and social groups. When I enrolled at the University of Washington, I intended for the two of us to get together often, but I swear her schedule\u2019s even busier than mine.\u201d</p><p>Paul grinned at her. \u201cI know what you mean. It\u2019s the same in my family.\u201d</p><p>By the time they stepped off the Bremerton ferry and took the foot ferry across to Cedar Cove, it was after eleven. They stopped at a deli, where Paul bought a loaf of fresh bread and a bottle of Washington State gew\u00fcrztraminer to take with them. At quarter to twelve, they trudged up the hill toward her grandmother\u2019s duplex on Poppy Lane.</p><p>When they arrived, Helen greeted them at the front door and eagerly ushered Paul and Ruth into the house. Ruth hugged her grandmother, whose white hair was cut stylishly short. Now in her early eighties, Helen was thinner than the last time Ruth had visited and somehow seemed more fragile. Her grandmother hugged her back, then paused to give Paul an embarrassingly frank look. Ruth felt her face heat as her grandmother spoke.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the young man who\u2019s captured my granddaughter\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrandma, this is Paul Gordon,\u201d Ruth said hurriedly, gesturing toward Paul.</p><p>\u201cThis is the soldier you\u2019ve been writing to, who\u2019s fighting in Afghanistan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Paul\u2019s response sounded a bit defensive, Ruth thought. He obviously preferred not to discuss it.</p><p>In an effort to ward off any misunderstanding, Ruth added, \u201cMy grandfather was a soldier when Grandma met him.\u201d</p><p>Helen nodded, and a faraway look stole over her. It took her a moment to refocus her attention on Ruth. \u201cCome, both of you,\u201d she said, stepping between them. She wrapped her arm around Ruth\u2019s waist. \u201cI set the table outside. It\u2019s such a beautiful afternoon, I thought we\u2019d eat on the patio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe brought some bread and a bottle of wine,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cPaul got them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Thank you, Paul.\u201d</p><p>While Ruth sliced the fresh-baked bread, he opened the wine, then helped her grandmother carry the salad plates outside. An apple pie cooled on the kitchen counter and the scent of cinnamon permeated the sunlit kitchen.</p><p>They chatted throughout the meal; the conversation was light and friendly as they lingered over their wine. Every now and then Ruth caught her grandmother staring at Paul with the strangest expression on her face. Ruth didn\u2019t know what to make of this. It almost seemed as if her grandmother was trying to place him, to recall where she\u2019d seen him before.</p><p>Helen seemed to read Ruth\u2019s mind. \u201cAm I embarrassing your beau, sweetheart?\u201d she asked with a half smile.</p><p>Ruth resisted informing her grandmother that Paul wasn\u2019t her anything, especially not her beau. They\u2019d had one lovely dinner together, but now their political differences seemed to have overtaken them.</p><p>\u201cI apologize, Paul.\u201d Helen briefly touched his hand, which rested on the table. \u201cWhen I first saw you\u2014\u201d She stopped abruptly. \u201cYou resemble someone I knew many years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere, Grandma?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cIn France, during the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in France during World War II?\u201d Ruth couldn\u2019t quite hide her shock.</p><p>Helen turned to her. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken much about those days, but now, at the end of my life, I think about them more and more.\u201d She pushed back her chair and stood.</p><p>Ruth stood, too, thinking her grandmother was about to carry in their empty plates and serve the pie.</p><p>Helen motioned her to sit. \u201cStay here. There\u2019s something I want you to see. I think perhaps it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>When her grandmother had left them, Ruth looked at Paul and shrugged. \u201cI have no idea what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Paul had been wonderful with her grandmother, thoughtful and attentive. He\u2019d asked a number of questions during the meal\u2014about Cedar Cove, about her life with Sam\u2014and listened intently when she responded. Ruth knew his interest was genuine. Together they cleared the table and returned the dishes to the kitchen, then waited for Helen at the patio table.</p><p>It was at least five minutes before she came back. She held a rolled-up paper that appeared to be some kind of poster, old enough to have turned yellow with age. Carefully she opened it and laid it flat on the cleared table. Ruth saw that the writing was French. In the center of the poster, which measured about eighteen inches by twenty-four, was a pencil sketch of two faces: a man and a woman, whose names she didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Ruth asked, pointing to the female.</p><p>Her grandmother smiled calmly. \u201cI am that woman.\u201d</p><p>Ruth frowned. Although she\u2019d seen photographs of her grandmother as a young woman, this sketch barely resembled the woman she knew. The man in the drawing, however, seemed familiar. Gazing at the sketch for a minute, she realized the face was vaguely like Paul\u2019s. Not so much in any similarity of features as in a quality of...character, she supposed.</p><p>\u201cAnd the man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Jean-Claude,\u201d Helen whispered, her voice full of pain.</p><p>Paul turned to Ruth, but she was at a complete loss and didn\u2019t know what to tell him. Her grandfather\u2019s name was Sam and she\u2019d never heard of this Jean-Claude. Certainly her father had never mentioned another man in his mother\u2019s life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is a wanted poster,\u201d Paul remarked. \u201cI speak some French\u2014studied it in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. The Germans offered a reward of one million francs to anyone who turned us in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in France during the war and you were wanted?\u201d This was more than Ruth could assimilate. She sat back down; so did her grandmother. Paul remained standing for a moment longer as he studied the poster.</p><p>\u201cYou and Jean-Claude were part of the French Resistance?\u201d Paul asked, but it was more statement than question.</p> <p>\u201cWe were.\u201d For a moment her grandmother seemed to have a hard time speaking. \u201cJean-Claude was my husband. We married during the war. He was my everything, strong and brave and handsome. His laughter filled a room. Sometimes, still, I think I can hear him.\u201d Her eyes grew teary and she dabbed at them with her linen handkerchief. \u201cThat was many years ago now and, as I said, I think perhaps it\u2019s time I spoke of it.\u201d</p><p>Ruth was grateful. She couldn\u2019t let her grandmother leave the story untold. She suspected her father hadn\u2019t heard any of this, and she wanted to learn everything she could about this unknown episode in their family history before it was forever lost.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing in France?\u201d Ruth asked. She couldn\u2019t comprehend that the woman she\u2019d always known as a warm and loving grandmother, who baked cookies and knit socks for Christmas, had been a freedom fighter in a foreign country.</p><p>\u201cI was attending the Sorbonne when the Germans invaded. My mother had been born in France, but her own parents were long dead. I was studying French literature. My parents were frantic for me to book my passage home, but like so many others in France, I didn\u2019t believe the country would fall. I assured my mother I\u2019d leave when I felt it was no longer safe. Being young and foolish, I thought she was overreacting. Besides, I was in love. Jean-Claude had asked me to marry him, and what woman in love wishes to leave her lover over rumors of war?\u201d She laughed lightly, shaking her head. \u201cFrance seemed invincible. We were convinced the Germans wouldn\u2019t invade, convinced they\u2019d suffer a humiliating defeat if they tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when it happened you were trapped,\u201d Paul said.</p> <p>Her grandmother drew in a deep breath. \u201cThere was the Blitzkrieg.... People were demoralized and defeated when France surrendered after only a few days of fighting. We were aghast that such a thing could happen. Jean-Claude and a few of his friends decided to resist the occupation. I decided I would, too, so we were married right away. My parents knew nothing of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you join the Resistance?\u201d Paul asked as Ruth studied her grandmother with fresh eyes.</p><p>\u201cJoin,\u201d she repeated scornfully. \u201cThere was no place to sign up and be handed a weapon and an instruction manual. A group of us students, naive and foolish, offered resistance to the German occupation. Later we learned there were other groups, eventually united under the leadership of General de Gaulle. We soon found one another. Jean-Claude and I\u2014we were young and too stupid to understand the price we would pay, but by then we\u2019d already lost some of our dearest friends. Jean-Claude and I refused to let them die in vain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Ruth breathed. She leaned closer to her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cWhatever we could, which in the beginning was pitifully little. The Germans suffered more casualties in traffic accidents. At first our resistance was mostly symbolic.\u201d A slow smile spread across her weathered face. \u201cBut we learned, oh yes, we learned.\u201d</p><p>Ruth was still having difficulty taking it all in. She pressed her hand to her forehead. She found it hard enough to believe that the sketch of the female in this worn poster was her own grandmother. Then to discover that the fragile, petite woman at her side had been part of the French Resistance...</p> <p>\u201cDoes my dad know any of this?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>Helen sighed heavily. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but I doubt it. Sam might have mentioned it to him. I\u2019ve told only my friends Clara and Winifred. No one else.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel I could talk to my sons about it. There was too much that\u2019s disturbing. Too many painful memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you...did you ever have to kill anyone?\u201d Ruth had trouble even getting the question out.</p><p>\u201cMany times,\u201d Helen answered bluntly. \u201cDoes that surprise you?\u201d</p><p>It shocked Ruth to the point that she couldn\u2019t ask anything else.</p><p>\u201cThe first time was the most difficult,\u201d her grandmother said. \u201cI was held by a French policeman.\u201d She added something derogatory in French, and although Ruth couldn\u2019t understand the language, some things didn\u2019t need translation. \u201cThe police worked hard to prove to the Germans what good little boys they were,\u201d she muttered, this time in English. \u201cI\u2019d been stopped and questioned, detained by this pig of a man. He said he was taking me to the police station. I had a small gun with me that I\u2019d hidden, a seven millimeter.\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s heart pounded as she listened to Helen recount this adventure.</p><p>\u201cThe pig didn\u2019t drive me to the police station. Instead he headed for open country and I knew that once he was outside town and away from the eyes of any witnesses, he would rape and murder me.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth pressed her hand to her mouth, holding back a gasp of horror.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d trained for self-defense?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>Her grandmother laughed. \u201cNo. How could we? There was no time for such lessons. But I realized that I didn\u2019t need technique. What I needed was nerve. This beast of a man pulled his gun on me but I was quicker. I shot him in the head.\u201d She paused, as if the memory of that terrifying moment was as clear as if it had happened only hours before. \u201cI buried him myself in a field and, as far as I know, he was never found.\u201d She wore a small satisfied look. \u201cHis mistake,\u201d she murmured, \u201cwas that he tightened his jaw when he reached for his gun\u2014and I saw. I\u2019d been watching him closely. He was thinking of what might happen, of what could go wrong. He was a professional, and I was only nineteen, and yet I knew that if I didn\u2019t act then, it would\u2019ve been too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you worry about what could happen, too?\u201d Ruth asked, not understanding how her grandmother could ever shoot another human being.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Helen answered flatly. \u201cI knew what would happen. We all did. We didn\u2019t have a chance of surviving, none of us. My parents would never have discovered my fate\u2014I would simply have disappeared. They didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d married Jean-Claude or changed my name.\u201d She stared out at the water. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why I lived. It makes no sense that God would spare me when all my friends, all those I loved, were killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJean-Claude, too?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes filled and she slowly nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere was he when you were taken by the policeman?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s mouth trembled. \u201cBy then, Jean-Claude had been captured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe French police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said in the thinnest of whispers. \u201cJean-Claude was being held by the Gestapo. That was the first time they got him\u2014but not the last.\u201d</p><p>Ruth had heard horror stories of the notorious German soldiers and their cruelty.</p><p>Helen straightened, and her back went rigid. \u201cI could only imagine how those monsters were torturing my husband.\u201d Contempt hardened her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Ruth glanced at Paul, whose gaze remained riveted on her grandmother.</p><p>At first Helen didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWhat else could I do? I had to rescue him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Paul asked this with the same shock Ruth felt.</p><p>\u201cYes, me and...\u201d Helen\u2019s smile was fleeting. \u201cI was very clever about it, too.\u201d The sadness returned with such intensity that it brought tears to Ruth\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey eventually killed him, didn\u2019t they?\u201d she asked, hardly able to listen to her grandmother\u2019s response.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Helen said as she turned to face Ruth. \u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cYou killed Jean-Claude?\u201d Ruth repeated incredulously, her heart hammering wildly.</p><p>Tears rolling down her cheeks, Helen nodded. \u201cGod forgive me, but I had no choice. I couldn\u2019t allow him to be tortured any longer. He begged me to do it, begged me to end his suffering. That was the second time he was captured, and they were more determined than ever to break him. He knew far too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better start at the beginning. You went into Gestapo headquarters?\u201d Paul asked, moving closer as if he didn\u2019t want to risk missing even one word. \u201cWas that the first time or the second?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. The first time, in April 1943, I rescued him. I pretended I was pregnant and brought a priest to the house the Gestapo had taken over. I insisted with great bravado that they force Jean-Claude to marry me and give my baby a name. I didn\u2019t care if they killed him, I said, but before he died I wanted him to give my baby his name.\u201d She paused. \u201cI was very convincing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t pregnant, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d her grandmother snapped. \u201cIt was a ploy to get into the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the priest a real priest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He didn\u2019t know I was using him, but I had no alternative. I was desperate to get Jean-Claude out alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe priest knew nothing,\u201d Ruth repeated, meeting Paul\u2019s eyes, astounded by her grandmother\u2019s nerve and cunning.</p><p>\u201cThe Father knew nothing,\u201d the older woman concurred, smiling grimly. \u201cBut I needed him, and so I used him. Thankfully the Gestapo believed me, and because they wanted to keep relations with the Church as smooth as possible, they brought Jean-Claude into the room.\u201d</p><p>Ruth could picture the scene, but she didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever possess that kind of bravery.</p><p>\u201cJean-Claude was in terrible pain, but he nearly laughed out loud when the priest asked him if he was the father of my child. Fortunately he didn\u2019t have to answer because our friends had arranged a distraction outside the house. A firebomb was tossed into a parked vehicle, which exploded. All but two Gestapo left the room. I shot them both right in front of the priest, and then Jean-Claude and I escaped through a back window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find the courage?\u201d Ruth asked breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cCourage?\u201d her grandmother echoed. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t courage. That was fear. I would do anything to save my husband\u2019s life\u2014and I did. Then, only a few weeks later, I was the one who killed him. What took courage was finding the will to live after Jean-Claude died. That was courage, and I would never have managed if it hadn\u2019t been for the American soldier who saved my life. If it hadn\u2019t been for Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my grandfather,\u201d Ruth explained to Paul.</p><p>\u201cI want to know more about Jean-Claude,\u201d Paul said, placing his arm around Ruth\u2019s shoulders. It felt good to be held by him and she leaned into his strength, his solid warmth.</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s eyes grew weary and she shook her head. \u201cPerhaps another day. I\u2019m tired now, too tired to speak anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d Paul whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do the dishes,\u201d Ruth insisted.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You should leave now,\u201d Helen said. \u201cYou have better things to do than talk to an old lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we want to talk to you,\u201d Ruth told her.</p> <p>\u201cYou will.\u201d Helen looked even more drawn. \u201cSoon, but not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll finish the story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the old woman said hoarsely. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>While her grandmother went to her room to rest, Ruth and Paul cleaned up the kitchen. At first they worked in silence, as if they didn\u2019t know quite what to say to each other. Ruth put the food away while Paul rinsed the dishes and set them inside the dishwasher.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know any of this before today?\u201d he asked, propping himself against the counter.</p> <p>\u201cNot a single detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father never mentioned it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Ruth wondered again how much her father actually knew about his mother\u2019s war adventures. \u201cI\u2019m sure you were the one who prompted her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Paul asked with a frown. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything, I think you reminded her of Jean-Claude.\u201d Ruth tilted her head to one side. \u201cIt\u2019s as if this woman I\u2019ve known all my life has suddenly become a stranger.\u201d Ruth finished by wiping down the counters. She knew they\u2019d need to leave soon if they were going to catch the ferry.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019d better check on her before we go,\u201d Paul suggested.</p> <p>She agreed and hurried out of the kitchen. Her grandmother\u2019s eyes opened briefly when Ruth entered the cool, silent room. Reaching for an afghan at the foot of the bed, Ruth covered her grandmother with it and kissed the papery skin of her cheek. She\u2019d always loved Helen, but she had an entirely new respect for her now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d Ruth whispered.</p><p>\u201cBring your young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Helen\u2019s response was low, and at first Ruth didn\u2019t understand her and strained to hear. Gradually her voice drifted off. Ruth waited until Helen was asleep before she slipped out of the room.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping?\u201d Paul asked, setting aside the magazine he was reading when Ruth returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Ruth nodded. \u201cShe started speaking to me in French. I so badly wish I knew what she said.\u201d</p><p>They left a few minutes later. Caught up in her own thoughts, Ruth walked down the hill beside Paul, neither of them speaking as they approached the foot ferry that would take them from Cedar Cove across to Bremerton.</p> <p>Once they were aboard the ferry, Paul went to get them coffee from the concession stand. While he was gone, Ruth decided she had to find out how much her family knew about her grandmother\u2019s war exploits. She opened her purse and rummaged for her cell phone.</p><p>Paul brought the coffee and set her plastic cup on the table.</p><p>Ruth glanced up long enough to thank him with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m calling my parents.\u201d</p><p>Paul nodded, tentatively sipping hot coffee. Then, in an obvious effort to give her some privacy, he moved to stand by the rail, gazing out at the water.</p><p>Her father answered on the third ring. \u201cDad, it\u2019s Ruth,\u201d she said in a rush.</p><p>\u201cWell, Ruthie, this is a pleasant surprise. I\u2019ll get your mother.\u201d</p><p>Her father had never enjoyed telephone conversations and generally handed the phone off to Ruth\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014I need to talk to you,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>That was her dad, too. He didn\u2019t like chitchat and wanted to get to the point as quickly as possible.</p><p>\u201cI went over to see Grandma this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she? We\u2019ve been meaning to get up there and see her and you. I don\u2019t know where the time goes. Thanksgiving was our last visit.\u201d</p><p>How is she? Ruth wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Her grandmother seemed fragile and old, and Ruth had never thought of her as either. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Dad. She\u2019s the same, except\u2014well, except she might have lost a few pounds.\u201d Ruth looked over at Paul and bit her lip. \u201cI...brought a friend along with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour roommate? What\u2019s her name again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLynn Blumenthal. No, this is a male friend.\u201d</p><p>That caught her father\u2019s attention. \u201cSomeone from school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we met sort of...by accident. His name is Paul Gordon and he\u2019s a sergeant in the marines. We\u2019ve been corresponding for the past four months. But Paul isn\u2019t the reason I\u2019m phoning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. What is?\u201d</p><p>Ruth dragged in a deep breath. \u201cLike I said before, I was visiting Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this marine you\u2019re seeing,\u201d he reiterated.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ruth didn\u2019t dare look at Paul a second time. Nervously, she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and leaned forward, lowering her voice. \u201cGrandma was in France during World War II. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Her father paused. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you aware that she was a member of the French Resistance?\u201d</p><p>Again he paused. \u201cMy father mentioned something shortly before he died, but I never got any more information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried, but she refused to talk about it. She said some things were better left buried and deflected all my questions. Do you mean to say she told you about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and, Dad, the stories were incredible! Did you know Grandma was married before she met Grandpa Sam?\u201d</p><p>This statement was greeted by a shocked silence.</p><p>\u201cHer husband\u2019s name was Jean-Claude,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cA Frenchman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She frowned as she tried to recall his surname from the poster. \u201cHe was part of the movement, too, and Grandma, your mother, went into a Gestapo headquarters and managed to get him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother?\u201d The question was obviously loud enough for Paul to hear from several feet away, because his eyebrows shot up as their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, your mother. I was desperate to learn more, but she got tired all of a sudden, and neither Paul nor I wanted to overtax her. She\u2019s taking a nap now, and Paul and I are on the ferry back to Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Ruth thought she heard her father mutter something like \u201cHoly Mother of God,\u201d then take a long, ragged breath.</p><p>\u201cAll these years and she\u2019s never said a word to me. Dad did, as I told you, but he didn\u2019t give me any details, and I never believed Mom\u2019s involvement amounted to much\u2014it was more along the lines of moral support, I always figured. My dad was over there and we knew that\u2019s where he met Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they ever go back to France?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. They did some traveling, but mostly in North America\u2014Florida, Mexico, Quebec...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess she really was keeping the past buried,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cShe must realize she\u2019s getting near the end of her life,\u201d her father went on, apparently thinking out loud. \u201cAnd she wants us to know. I\u2019m grateful she was willing to share this with you. Still, it\u2019s pretty hard to take in. My mother...part of the French Resistance. She told me she was in school over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was.\u201d Ruth didn\u2019t want her father to think Helen had lied to him.</p><p>\u201cThen how in heaven\u2019s name did she get involved in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made her start talking about it now?\u201d her father asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s because she knows she\u2019s getting old, as you suggested,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cAnd because of Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, this young man you\u2019re with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Her father hesitated. \u201cI know you can\u2019t discuss this now with Paul there, so give us a call later, will you? Your mother\u2019s going to want to hear about this young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy,\u201d she said, thinking with some amusement that she sounded like an obedient child.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give Mom a call later,\u201d her father said. \u201cWe need to set up a visit ourselves, possibly for the Memorial Day weekend.\u201d</p><p>After a quick farewell, she clicked off the phone and put it back inside her purse.</p><p>Paul, still sipping his coffee, approached her. She picked up her own cup as he sat down beside her.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t enjoyed an afternoon more in years,\u201d Paul said. \u201cNot in years,\u201d he added emphatically.</p><p>Ruth grinned, then drank some of her cooling coffee. \u201cI\u2019d like to believe it was my company that was so engaging, but I know you\u2019re enthralled with my grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd her granddaughter,\u201d Paul murmured, but he said it as if he felt wary of the fact that he found her appealing.</p><p>Ruth took his hand. \u201cWe haven\u2019t settled anything,\u201d he reminded her, tightening his hold on her fingers.</p><p>\u201cDo we have to right this minute?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI want to see you again,\u201d she told him, moving closer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I want to see you again, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Ruth didn\u2019t hide her relief.</p><p>Paul\u2019s responding smile was brief. \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll do this your way\u2014one day at a time. But remember, I only have two weeks\u2019 leave.\u201d</p><p>She knew instinctively that these would be the shortest two weeks of her life.</p><p>\u201cBy the time I ship out, we should know how we feel. Agreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d she said without hesitation.</p><p>He nodded solemnly. \u201cDo you own a pair of in-line skates?\u201d he asked unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cSure, but I don\u2019t have them in Seattle. I can easily rent a pair, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to go skating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Ruth laughed. \u201cI\u2019d love to, with one stipulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Ruth hated to admit how clumsy she was on the skates. \u201cIf I fall down, promise you\u2019ll help me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I get hurt...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you get hurt,\u201d Paul said, \u201cI promise to kiss you and make it better.\u201d</p><p>Ruth had the distinct feeling that she wasn\u2019t going to mind falling, not one little bit.</p><p>Six</p><p>Helen Shelton</p><p>5-B Poppy Lane</p><p>Cedar Cove, Washington April 23</p><p>Dearest Clara, Of course I understand why you won\u2019t be able to take the Victoria cruise with Winifred and me. Don\u2019t give it another thought. You\u2019ll be with us in spirit. We\u2019ll miss you, but believe me, we both understand. It\u2019s important that you be kind to yourself and not overdo things. You\u2019ve suffered a major loss; you and Charles were married for sixty-four years. After Sam died, and that\u2019s been over twenty years ago now, I felt as if I\u2019d lost my right arm. But I can promise you that this terrible sense of loss does grow easier to bear with time. The first year was the most difficult\u2014the first summer without him, the first birthdays, the first Christmas. On a happier note, has your granddaughter set her wedding date yet? I know you\u2019ve been anxious to see Elizabeth settled. I have news on the romance front myself. Ruth was over last week with a soldier she\u2019s been writing to who\u2019s on leave from Afghanistan. He\u2019s a delightful young man and it was easy to see that her feelings for him are quite intense. His name is Paul Gordon. When Ruth first introduced us, I\u2019m afraid I embarrassed us both by staring at him. Paul could\u2019ve been Jean-Claude\u2019s grandson, the resemblance is that striking. For the past few weeks, I\u2019ve been dreaming and thinking about my war experiences. You\u2019ve been encouraging me for years to write them down. I\u2019ve tried, but couldn\u2019t make myself do it. However...I don\u2019t know if this was wise but I told Ruth and her young man some of what happened to me in France. I know I shocked them both. My son phoned later the same day, and John was quite upset with me, especially since I\u2019d told Ruth and not him. I tried to explain that these were memories I\u2019ve spent most of my life trying to forget. I do hope he understands. But Pandora\u2019s box is open now, and my family wants to learn everything they can. I\u2019ve agreed to allow Ruth to tape our conversations, which satisfies everyone. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re right, my dear friend\u2014I should\u2019ve told my children long ago. Do take care of yourself, and write soon. Once Winifred and I are back from our Victoria adventure, we\u2019ll make plans to see each other this summer. Bless you, dear Clara, </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Your friend always,</p><p>Helen \u201cI want you to meet my family,\u201d Paul announced a little more than a week after their first date. They\u2019d spent every available moment together; they\u2019d been to the Seattle Center and the Space Needle, rowing on Lake Washington, out to dinner and had seen a couple of movies. Sitting on the campus lawn, he waited for Ruth after her last class of the day. He stood when she reached him, and Ruth noticed he wasn\u2019t smiling as he issued the invitation.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom and Dad are at the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean you want me to meet them now?\u201d Ruth asked as they strolled across the lush green grass toward the visitors\u2019 parking lot. If she\u2019d known she was meeting Paul\u2019s parents she would\u2019ve been better prepared. She would\u2019ve done something about her hair and worn a different outfit and...</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Paul muttered.</p><p>Ruth stopped and he walked forward two or three steps before he noticed. Frowning, he glanced back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d she asked, clutching her books to her chest.</p><p>Paul looked everywhere but at her. \u201cMy parents feel they should meet you, since I\u2019m spending most of my time in your company. The way they figure it, you must be someone important in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth\u2019s heart did a happy little jig. \u201cAm I?\u201d she asked flirtatiously.</p><p>A rigid expression came over him, betraying none of his feelings. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cListen, Ruth, I\u2019m not handing you my heart so you can break it. You don\u2019t want to be involved with a soldier. Well, I\u2019m a soldier, and either you accept that or at the end of these two weeks, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He sounded so...so military. As if he thought a relationship could be that simple, that straightforward. Life didn\u2019t divide evenly into black and white. There were plenty of gray areas, too. All right, so Paul had a point. In the back of her mind, Ruth hoped that, given time, Paul would decide to get out of the war business. She wasn\u2019t the kind of woman who\u2019d be content to sit at home while the man she loved was off in some faraway country risking his life. Experiencing dreadful things. Suffering. Maybe dying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d rather I didn\u2019t meet your family?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>That hurt. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Some of her pain must have been evident in her voice, because Paul came toward her and tucked his finger beneath her chin. Their eyes met for the longest moment. \u201cIf my family meets you, they\u2019ll know how much I care about you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Ruth managed to smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad you care, because I care about you, too,\u201d she admitted. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t solve anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she agreed, leaning forward so their lips could meet. She half expected Paul to pull away, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead, he groaned and forcefully brought his mouth to hers. Their kiss was passionate, deep\u2014honest. She felt the sharp edges of her textbooks digging painfully into her breasts, and still Ruth melted in his arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making things impossible,\u201d he mumbled when he lifted his head from hers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been known to do that.\u201d</p><p>Paul reached for her hand and led her into the parking lot. \u201cI mentioned your grandmother to my parents,\u201d he said casually as he unlocked the car doors.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Ruth said, slipping into the passenger seat. \u201cThat explains it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy your family wants to meet me. I\u2019ve brought you to my family. They feel cheated.\u201d</p><p>Paul shook his head solemnly.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. But...speaking of your grandmother, when can we see her again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow afternoon, if you like. I talked to her this morning before my classes and she asked when we could make a return visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re curious about what happened, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Paul asked as he inserted the key into the ignition.</p><p>\u201cVery much so,\u201d Ruth admitted. Since their visit to Cedar Cove, she\u2019d thought about her grandmother\u2019s adventures again and again. She\u2019d done some research, too, using the Internet and a number of library books on the war. In fact, Ruth was so absorbed by the history of the Resistance movement, she\u2019d found it difficult to concentrate on the psychology essay she was trying to write.</p><p>She\u2019d had several days to become accustomed to Helen\u2019s exploits during the Second World War. And yet she still had trouble imagining the woman she knew as a fighter for the French Resistance.</p><p>\u201cShe loved Jean-Claude,\u201d Paul commented.</p><p>Ruth nodded. Her grandmother had loved her husband enough to kill him\u2014a shocking reality that would not have made sense at any other time in Helen\u2019s life. And then, at some point after that, Helen had met her Sam. How? Ruth wondered. When did they fall in love? Family history told her that Sam Shelton had fought in the European campaign during the Second World War. He\u2019d been in France toward the end of the war, she recalled. She wondered how much he\u2019d known about Helen\u2019s past.</p><p>Ruth could only hope her grandmother would provide some answers tomorrow.</p><p>The meeting with Paul\u2019s family was going well, Ruth decided. His parents were delightful\u2014immediately welcoming. Barbara, his mother, had an easy laugh and a big heart. She brought Ruth into the kitchen and settled her on a stool at the counter while she fussed with the dinner salad.</p><p>Paul and his father, Greg, were on the patio, firing up the grill and chatting. Every now and then, Ruth caught Paul stealing a glance in her direction.</p><p>\u201cI want to help,\u201d Ruth told his mother.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Barbara Gordon insisted as she tore lettuce leaves into a large wooden bowl. \u201cI\u2019m just so pleased to finally meet you. It was as if Paul had some secret he was keeping from us.\u201d</p><p>Ruth smiled and sipped her glass of iced tea.</p><p>\u201cMy father was career military\u2014in the marines,\u201d Barbara said, chopping tomatoes for the salad. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that was what induced Paul to join the military or not, but I suspect it had an influence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about him being stationed so far from home?\u201d Ruth asked, curious to hear his mother\u2019s perspective. She couldn\u2019t imagine any mother would want to see her son or daughter at that kind of risk.</p><p>Barbara sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t like it, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. Every sane person hates war. My father didn\u2019t want to fight in World War II, and I cried my eyes out the day Greg left for Vietnam. Now here\u2019s my oldest son in Afghanistan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems most generations are called upon to serve their country, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>Barbara agreed with a short nod. \u201cFreedom isn\u2019t free\u2014for us or for the countries we support. Granted, some conflicts we\u2019ve been involved in seem misguided, but unfortunately war appears to be part of the human condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ruth asked, although she didn\u2019t really expect a response.</p><p>\u201cI think every generation has asked that same question,\u201d Barbara said thoughtfully, putting the salad bowl aside. She began to prepare a dressing, pouring olive oil and balsamic vinegar into a small bowl. \u201cPaul told me you have a problem with his unwillingness to leave the marines at the end of his commitment. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>A little embarrassed by the question, Ruth nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, as his mother, I want Paul out of the marines, too, but that isn\u2019t a decision you or I can make for him. My son has always been his own person. That\u2019s how his father and I raised him.\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s gaze followed Paul as he stood with his father by the barbecue. He looked up and saw her, frowning as if he knew exactly what she and his mother were talking about. Ruth gave him a reassuring wave.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in love with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d his mother asked, watching her closely.</p><p>The question took Ruth by surprise. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I am.\u201d Ruth didn\u2019t want to be\u2014something she hadn\u2019t acknowledged openly until this moment. He\u2019d described his reluctance to hand her his heart to break. She felt the same way and feared he\u2019d end up breaking hers.</p><p>There seemed to be a tacit agreement not to broach these difficult subjects during dinner.</p><p>The four of them sat on the patio around a big table, shaded by an overlarge umbrella. His mother had made corn bread as well as the salad, and the steaks were grilled to perfection. After dinner, Ruth helped with the cleanup and then Paul made their excuses.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to a movie?\u201d she whispered on their way out the door, figuring he\u2019d used that as a convenient pretext for leaving.</p><p>\u201cI had to get you out of there before my mother started showing you my baby pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you were a real cutie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see my brother and sister, especially the nude photos.\u201d</p><p>Ruth giggled.</p><p>Instead of the theater, they headed for Lake Washington and walked through the park, licking ice-cream cones, talking and laughing. Ruth couldn\u2019t remember laughing with anyone as much as she did with Paul.</p><p>He dropped her off after ten, walked her up to the front porch and kissed her good-night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at noon,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter your morning class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon,\u201d she repeated, her arms linked around his neck. That seemed too long. Despite her fears, despite the looming doubts, she was in love with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure your grandmother\u2019s up to having company so soon?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ruth pressed her forehead against his shoulder. \u201cI think the real question\u2019s whether we\u2019re ready for the next installment. I don\u2019t know if I can bear to hear what happened to Jean-Claude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but she needs to tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t talk about it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Paul kissed her again.</p><p>Ruth felt at peace in his arms. Only when she stopped to think about the future, their future, did she become uncertain and confused.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Ruth and Paul sat with her grandmother at the kitchen table in her Cedar Cove house as rain dripped rhythmically against the windowpane. The day was overcast and dreary, often the case with spring in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Helen reached for the teapot in the middle of the table and filled each of their cups, then offered them freshly baked peanut-butter cookies arranged on a small dessert plate. Ruth recognized the plate from her childhood. She and her grandmother had often had tea together when she was a youngster. Her visits to Cedar Cove were special; her grandmother had listened while Ruth chatted away endlessly, sharing girlish confidences. It was during those private little tea parties that they\u2019d bonded, grandmother and granddaughter.</p><p>Today the slow ritual of pouring tea and passing around cookies demanded patience. Ruth badly wanted to throw questions at Helen, but she could see that her grandmother would begin her story again only when she was ready. Helen seemed to be bracing herself for this next installment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about the things I mentioned on your last visit,\u201d Helen finally said, sipping her tea. Steam rose from the delicate bone-china cup. \u201cIt was a lot for you to take in at one time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about your adventures, Grandma.\u201d And they truly were adventures, of a kind few people experienced these days. Real adventures, with real and often involuntary risks.</p><p>Helen nodded. \u201cMy children didn\u2019t, either. But as I said before, it\u2019s time.\u201d Helen set the fragile cup back in its saucer. \u201cYour father phoned and asked me about all this.\u201d She paused, a look of distress on her face. \u201cI hope he\u2019ll forgive me for keeping it from him all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he will,\u201d Ruth assured her.</p> <p>Helen obviously wanted to believe that. \u201cHe asked me to tell him more, but I couldn\u2019t,\u201d she said sadly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Dad understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t relive those memories again so soon.\u201d</p><p>Ruth laid a comforting hand on her grandmother\u2019s arm. This information of Helen\u2019s was an important part of her family history. Today, with Helen\u2019s agreement, she\u2019d come prepared with a small tape recorder. Now nothing would be lost.</p><p>\u201cJean-Claude had a wonderful gift,\u201d her grandmother said, breaking into the story without preamble. \u201cHe was a big man who made friends easily\u2014a natural leader. Our small group trusted him with our lives.\u201d</p> <p>Paul nodded encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cWithin a few minutes of meeting someone, he could determine if he should trust that person,\u201d Helen continued. \u201cMore and more people wanted to join us. We started with a few students like ourselves, who were determined to resist the Nazis. Soon, others found us and we connected with groups across France. We all worked together as we lit fires of hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the wanted poster with your picture and Jean-Claude\u2019s,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>Her grandmother smiled ruefully, as if that small piece of notoriety embarrassed her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid Jean-Claude and I acquired a somewhat exaggerated reputation. Soon almost everything that happened in Paris as part of the Resistance movement was falsely attributed to us, whether we were involved or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a fire in a supply depot. Jean-Claude and I wished we\u2019d been responsible, but we weren\u2019t. Yet that was what prompted the Germans to post our pictures.\u201d A smile brightened her eyes. \u201cIt was a rather unflattering sketch of Jean-Claude, he told me, although I disagreed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you tell me some of the anti-Nazi activities you were able to undertake?\u201d Ruth asked, knowing her father would want to hear as much of this as his mother could recall.</p><p>Helen considered the question. \u201cPerhaps the most daring adventure was one of Jean-Claude\u2019s. There was an SS officer, a horrible man, a pig.\u201d This word was spit out, as if even the memory of him disgusted her. \u201cJean-Claude discovered that this officer had obtained information through torturing a fellow Resistance member, information that put us all at risk. Jean-Claude decided the man had to die and that he would be the one to do it.\u201d</p><p>Paul glanced at Ruth, and he seemed to tell her that killing an SS officer would be no easy task.</p><p>Helen sipped her tea once more. \u201cI feared for Jean-Claude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this when he...died?\u201d Ruth asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d For emphasis, her grandmother shook her head. \u201cThat came later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Paul urged.</p><p>\u201cOne night Jean-Claude left me and another woman in a garden in the suburbs, at the home of a sympathetic schoolteacher who\u2019d made contact with our group. He and his wife went out for the evening. Jean-Claude instructed us to dig a grave and fill it with quicklime. We were to wait there for his return. He left with two other men and I was convinced I\u2019d never see him again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you did,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>The old woman nodded. \u201cAccording to Jean-Claude, it was either kill the SS officer or he would take us all down. He simply knew too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did Jean-Claude do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a story unto itself.\u201d Helen sat even straighter in her chair. \u201cThis happened close to the final time he was captured. He knew, I believe, that he would die soon, and it made him fearless. He took more and more risks. And he valued his own life less and less.\u201d Her eyes shone with tears as she gazed out the rain-blurred window, lost in a world long since past.</p><p>\u201cThe SS officer had taken a room in a luxury hotel on the outskirts of Paris,\u201d Helen went on a minute later. \u201cHe was in the habit of sipping a cognac before retiring for the evening. When he called for his drink, it was Jean-Claude who brought it to him wearing a waiter\u2019s jacket. I don\u2019t know how he killed the SS man, but he did it without alerting anyone. He made sure there was no blood. The problem was getting the body out of the hotel without anyone seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Couldn\u2019t he just leave it there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Helen repeated, shaking her head. \u201cHad the man\u2019s body been discovered, the entire staff would have been tortured as punishment. Eventually someone would have broken. In any event, Jean-Claude managed to smuggle the body out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>Again her grandmother smiled. \u201cJean-Claude was clever. His friends hauled him and the body of the SS officer up the chimney. First the dead man and then the live one. That was necessary, you see, because there was a guard at the end of the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut once they got to the rooftop, how did he manage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an effort,\u201d Helen said. \u201cJean-Claude told me they tossed the body from that rooftop to the roof of another building and then another\u2014an office building. They lowered him down in the elevator. When the men arrived with the body, we all worked together and buried him quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe SS officer\u2019s disappearance must have caused trouble for the Resistance,\u201d Paul said.</p><p>Helen nodded ardently. \u201cOh, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was Jean-Claude captured the second time?\u201d Ruth asked. She was intensely curious and yet she dreaded hearing about the death of this brave man her grandmother had loved.</p><p>Helen\u2019s eyes glistened and she lifted her teacup with an unsteady hand. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you think,\u201d she prefaced, and the cup made a slight clinking sound as it rattled against the saucer. Helen placed both hands in her lap and took a moment to compose herself. \u201cWe were headed for the Metro\u2014the subway. By then I\u2019d bleached my hair and we\u2019d both changed our appearances as much as possible. I don\u2019t think my own mother would have recognized me. Jean-Claude\u2019s, either,\u201d she added softly, her voice a mere whisper.</p><p>Paul reached for Ruth\u2019s hand, as if sensing that she needed his support.</p><p>When her grandmother resumed speaking, it was in French. She switched languages naturally, apparently without realizing she\u2019d done so. All at once, she covered her face and broke into sobs.</p><p>Although Ruth hadn\u2019t understood a word, she started crying, too, and gently wrapped her arms around her grandmother\u2019s thin shoulders. Hugging her was the only thing she could do to ease this remembered pain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right,\u201d Ruth cooed over and over. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to tell us any more.\u201d</p><p>Paul agreed. \u201cThis is too hard on her\u2014and you,\u201d he said.</p><p>They stayed for another hour, but it was clear that reliving the past had exhausted her grandmother. She seemed so frail now, even more so than during the previous visit.</p><p>While her grandmother rested in her room, Ruth cleared the table. As she took care of the few dirty dishes, her eyes filled with tears again. It was hard to think about the horrors her grandmother had endured.</p><p>\u201cWhen she was speaking French, she must\u2019ve been reliving the day Jean-Claude died,\u201d Ruth said, turning so her back was pressed against the kitchen counter.</p><p>Paul nodded. \u201cShe was,\u201d he answered somberly.</p><p>Ruth studied him as she returned to the kitchen table, where he sat. \u201cYou said you speak French. Could you understand what she was saying?\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cAt the Metro that day, Jean-Claude was picked up in a routine identity check by the French police. Through pure luck, Helen was able to get on the train without being stopped. She had to stand helplessly inside the subway car and watch as the police hauled him to Gestapo headquarters.\u201d Paul paused long enough to give her an odd smile. \u201cThe next part was a tirade against the police, whom she hated. Remember last week when she explained that some of the French police were trying to prove their worth to the Germans? Well, apparently Jean-Claude was one of their most wanted criminals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tortured him, didn\u2019t they?\u201d she asked, although she already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Paul met her eyes. \u201cUnmercifully.\u201d</p><p>Ruth swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cHelen tried to save him. Disregarding her own safety, she went in after him, only this time she went alone. No sympathetic priest.\u201d Paul\u2019s face hardened. \u201cThey dragged her into the basement, where Jean-Claude was being tortured. They had him strung up by his arms. He was bloody and his face was unrecognizable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Ruth covered her eyes with both hands.</p><p>\u201cThey taunted him. Said they had his accomplice and now he would see her die.\u201d</p><p>Ruth could barely talk. \u201cThey...were going to...kill Helen\u2014in front of Jean-Claude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what she said, it wouldn\u2019t have been an easy death. The point was for Jean-Claude to watch her suffer\u2014to watch her die a slow, agonizing death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t actually say it,\u201d Paul continued. \u201cShe didn\u2019t have to spell it out, but Jean-Claude obviously hadn\u2019t been broken. Seeing her suffer would have done it, though, and your grandmother knew that. She also knew that if he talked, it would mean the torture and death of others in the Resistance.\u201d Paul looked away for a moment. \u201cApparently he and his friends had helped a number of British pilots escape German detection. At risk was the entire underground effort. Jean-Claude knew more than anyone suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen couldn\u2019t let that happen,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cNo, and Jean-Claude understood that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember how she said she was the one who killed him? She didn\u2019t mean that literally, did she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d</p><p>This was beginning not to make sense. \u201cBut...how?\u201d</p><p>Paul leaned forward and braced his elbows on the table. \u201cHer voice had started to break at this point and I didn\u2019t catch everything. She talked about a cyanide tablet. I\u2019m not sure how she got hold of it. But I know she kissed him.... A final kiss goodbye. By this stage she was too emotional to understand clearly.\u201d</p><p>The pieces started to fall together for Ruth. \u201cShe gave him the pill\u2014you mean instead of taking it herself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what it sounded like to me,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>\u201cWas this when he\u2019d asked her to kill him? And then she kissed him and transferred the pill?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Paul cleared his throat, but his voice was still rough. \u201cShe said Jean-Claude had begged her to kill him. He spoke to her in English, which the Germans weren\u2019t able to understand.\u201d</p><p>Ruth pictured the terrible scene. Helen and Jean-Claude arguing. If Helen swallowed the pill, she\u2019d be dead and the Gestapo would lose their bargaining chip. Even knowing that, Jean-Claude couldn\u2019t bear to see his wife die. It truly would have broken him.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking in another language added enough confusion that she had the opportunity to do what he asked,\u201d Ruth speculated.</p><p>\u201cLast time she told us about being driven by fear instead of courage,\u201d Paul reminded her. \u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t stop to think about what she was doing\u2014she couldn\u2019t. Nor could she refuse Jean-Claude.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth wanted to bury her face in her hands and weep.</p><p>\u201cJean-Claude thanked her,\u201d Paul added.</p><p>\u201cShe would have refused.\u201d Ruth could see it all in her mind, the argument between them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m convinced she did refuse at first. She loved Jean-Claude\u2014he was her husband.\u201d</p><p>Ruth couldn\u2019t imagine a worse scenario.</p> <p>Paul\u2019s voice dropped slightly. \u201cShe said Jean-Claude had never begged for mercy, never pleaded for anything, but he told her he couldn\u2019t bear any more pain. Above all, he couldn\u2019t bear it if they killed her. He begged her to let him die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved her that much,\u201d Ruth said in a hushed whisper.</p><p>\u201cAnd she loved him that much, enough to spare him any more torture, even at the risk of her own death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t kill her, though,\u201d Ruth said, stating the obvious. \u201cEven though they must have figured out that she was responsible for his death?\u201d</p><p>Paul\u2019s eyes widened as if he couldn\u2019t explain that any more than she could. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say what happened next.\u201d</p><p>Ruth stood, anxious now to see her grandmother before they left. \u201cI\u2019d better check on her.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth went to her grandmother\u2019s room to find her resting fitfully. Helen\u2019s eyes fluttered open when Ruth stepped quietly past the threshold.</p><p>\u201cHave I shocked you?\u201d Helen asked, holding out her hand to Ruth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Ruth told her grandmother, who had to be the bravest woman she would ever know. She sat on the edge of the bed and whispered, \u201cThank you, Grandma\u2014for everything you did. And for doing Paul and me the honor of sharing it with us.\u201d</p><p>Helen smiled and touched her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d</p><p>Taking her grandmother\u2019s hand between her own, she kissed the old woman\u2019s knuckles. A lump filled her throat and she couldn\u2019t find the words to express her love.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you meet Grandpa?\u201d she finally asked.</p><p>Helen smiled again and her eyes drifted shut. \u201cTwo years later. He was one of the American soldiers who came with Patton\u2019s army to free us from the concentration camp.\u201d</p><p>This was an entirely different aspect of the story.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it was learned that I was an American citizen, I was immediately questioned and given priority treatment to be sent home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years,\u201d Ruth said in a choked voice. \u201cYou were in a camp for two years?\u201d Just when she was convinced there was nothing more to horrify her, Helen revealed something else.</p><p>\u201cBuchenwald...I don\u2019t want to talk about it any longer,\u201d Helen muttered.</p><p>It was little wonder her grandmother had never spoken of those years. The memories were far worse than the worst Ruth had been able to imagine.</p><p>Her grandmother brushed the hair from Ruth\u2019s brow. \u201cI want you to know I like your young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe reminded you of Jean-Claude, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was weak, which told Ruth how drained this afternoon\u2019s conversation had left Helen. \u201cNot at first, but then he smiled and I saw Jean-Claude in Paul\u2019s eyes.\u201d She swallowed a couple of times and added, \u201cI wanted to die after Jean-Claude did. I would\u2019ve done anything if only the Germans had put me out of my living hell. They knew that and decided it was better to let me live and remember, each and every day, that I\u2019d killed my own husband.\u201d A tear slid down her face. \u201cI can\u2019t speak of it anymore.\u201d</p><p>Ruth understood. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to rest. Try to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s answering sigh told Ruth how badly she needed that just then.</p><p>\u201cCome back and see me soon,\u201d she called as Ruth stood.</p><p>\u201cI will, I promise.\u201d She bent down to kiss the soft cheek.</p><p>Paul was waiting for her in the living room, flipping through the Cedar Cove Chronicle, but he got up when Ruth returned. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>Ruth shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s tired.\u201d Her eyes were watering again, despite her best efforts not to cry. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the pain her grandmother had endured and kept hidden all these years.</p><p>Paul held open his arms and she walked into his embrace as naturally as she slipped on a favorite coat. Once there, she began to cry\u2014harsh, broken sobs she thought would never end.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Once again Ruth and Paul spoke little on the ferry ride back to Seattle.</p><p>Ruth\u2019s entire perspective on her grandmother had changed. Until now, she\u2019d always viewed the petite, gentle woman as...well, her grandmother. All of a sudden Ruth was forced to realize that Helen had been young once, and deeply involved in events that had changed or destroyed many lives. She\u2019d been an ordinary young woman from a fairly privileged background. She\u2019d been a student, fallen in love, enjoyed a carefree existence. Then this ordinary young woman had been caught up in extraordinary circumstances\u2014and risen to their demands.</p><p>Ruth was curious about the connection between her grandmother\u2019s life during the war and her life afterward. Clearly the link was her grandfather, whom she\u2019d never had a chance to know.</p><p>Paul stood with Ruth at the railing as the ferry glided through the relatively smooth waters of Puget Sound. The rain had stopped, and although the sky remained cloudy and gray, the air was fresh with only the slightest hint of brine.</p><p>\u201cEvery story I hear leaves me amazed that this incredible woman is my grandmother,\u201d Ruth said fervently, grateful that Paul was beside her.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m overwhelmed, and I just met her.\u201d</p><p>They exchanged tentative smiles, and then they both sighed in appreciation, Ruth thought, of everything Helen Shelton had been and done.</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d known my grandfather,\u201d she said. \u201cHe seems to have been the one who gave my grandmother a reason to live. He loved her and she loved him.\u201d Ruth knew that from every word her grandmother and her dad had said about Sam Shelton.</p><p>\u201cHow old were you when he died?\u201d Paul asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo or so.\u201d She turned so she could look directly at Paul. \u201cWhen I saw my grandmother in her bedroom, she said he was with a group of soldiers who freed the inmates in the concentration camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in a concentration camp?\u201d</p><p>Ruth nodded. \u201cShe was there at least a couple of years.\u201d</p><p>Paul frowned, obviously upset.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear to think what her life was like in one of those obscene places,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cIt would\u2019ve been grim. You\u2019re right\u2014they were obscene. Places of death.\u201d</p><p>Ruth didn\u2019t welcome the reminder. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve been with me on these visits,\u201d she told him. Paul\u2019s presence helped her assimilate the details her grandmother had shared. He\u2019d given her a feeling of comfort and companionship as they\u2019d listened to these painful wartime experiences. Ruth genuinely believed there was something about Paul that had led Helen to divulge her secrets.</p><p>After the ferry docked, Paul and Ruth walked along the Seattle waterfront, where they ate clam chowder, followed by fish and chips, for dinner. Their mood was somber, and yet, strangely, Ruth felt a sense of peace.</p><p>The next day, after her classes, she hurried back to her rental house and ran into Lynn. As much as possible, Ruth had avoided her roommate. Her relationship with Lynn had been awkward ever since the argument over Clay. Lynn\u2019s lie, which she\u2019d told in an effort to keep Ruth from meeting Paul, hadn\u2019t helped.</p><p>Lynn was coming out just as Ruth leaped up the porch steps. Her roommate hesitated.</p><p>Ruth did, too. She\u2019d never said anything to Lynn about her intentional mix-up that first night she was meeting Paul. Her classes would be over at the end of May and she was more than ready to move out.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Lynn offered uncertainly.</p><p>Ruth\u2019s pace slowed as she waited, half expecting Lynn to make some derogatory remark about Paul. Because Ruth had been with him so often lately, she\u2019d had very little contact with her roommate.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing Paul again?\u201d</p><p>The question lacked the scornful tone she\u2019d used when referring to him previously. She seemed more prompted by simple curiosity than anything else.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re meeting some friends of his later. Why?\u201d Ruth couldn\u2019t help being suspicious. If he\u2019d phoned with a change of plan, she needed to know about it. She knew from experience that Lynn couldn\u2019t be trusted to relay the message.</p><p>Lynn shrugged. \u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there something you aren\u2019t telling me?\u201d Ruth\u2019s voice was calm.</p><p>Her roommate had the grace to blush. \u201cHe didn\u2019t call, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I could believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2014okay, maybe what I did that night was pretty stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe?\u201d Ruth echoed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, it was. I was upset because of Clay.\u201d She didn\u2019t meet Ruth\u2019s eyes. \u201cI thought Clay was really hot and you dumped him for soldier boy, and I thought that was just wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to decide who I\u2019m allowed to date.\u201d Ruth couldn\u2019t keep the anger out of her voice. What Lynn had tried to do still rankled. If her cell phone battery hadn\u2019t been low, she and Paul might have missed each other completely. That thought sent chills down her spine.</p><p>Lynn released a long sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it\u2014you were right about Clay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s...he\u2019s stuck on himself.\u201d</p><p>Ruth suspected that meant he wasn\u2019t interested in Lynn.</p><p>\u201cI...I like Paul,\u201d her roommate confessed.</p><p>Ruth wasn\u2019t even aware that Lynn had met him and said so.</p><p>\u201cHe stopped by one afternoon when he thought you were back from classes, only you weren\u2019t and I was here. We talked for a bit. Then he left to look for you at the library.\u201d</p><p>Funny that neither had mentioned the incident earlier. \u201cI had the impression you were dead set against him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot him,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cI\u2019m against the war in Iraq.... I thought you were, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like war of any kind. This war or any war. Still, the United States is involved in the Middle East, and no matter what, it\u2019s our young men and women who are fighting there. Politics aside, I want to support our troops.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lynn suddenly seemed to find something absolutely mesmerizing about her shoes.</p><p>Ruth moved past her on the porch. \u201cI\u2019d better go in and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRuth,\u201d Lynn said sharply. Ruth turned to face her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the other night. That really was an awful thing to do. I was upset and I took it out on you.\u201d</p><p>Ruth had pretty much figured that out on her own. \u201cPaul and I connected, so no harm done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, and I\u2019m glad you did because I think Paul is great. I know he\u2019s a soldier and all, but he\u2019s a nice guy. I only met him that one time, but I could see he\u2019s ten times the man Clay will ever be. He\u2019s the kind of guy I hope to meet.\u201d</p><p>Paul had obviously impressed her during their brief exchange. She wondered what they\u2019d talked about.</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well,\u201d Ruth said.</p><p>\u201cShakespeare, right?\u201d Lynn asked. \u201cIn other words, all is forgiven?\u201d</p><p>Ruth laughed and nodded, then started into the house.</p> <p>Paul picked her up at five-thirty and they drove to a Mexican restaurant in downtown Kent. Paul had arranged for her to meet his best friend.</p><p>Carley and Brian Hart were high school sweethearts and Brian had known Paul for most of his life.</p><p>\u201cWe go way back,\u201d Brian said when they were introduced. He slid out of the booth and they exchanged handshakes, with Paul standing just behind Ruth, his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pleased to meet you both.\u201d They were a handsome couple. Carley was a delicate blonde with soulful blue eyes, and her husband was tall and muscular, as if he routinely worked out.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re pleased to meet you, too,\u201d Carley said when Ruth slipped into the booth across from her.</p><p>Paul got in beside Ruth.</p> <p>\u201cI insisted Paul introduce us,\u201d Carley said as she reached for a chip and dipped it in the salsa. \u201cEvery time we tried to get together during his leave, he already had plans with you.\u201d</p><p>Ruth hadn\u2019t thought of it that way, but realized she\u2019d monopolized his time. \u201cI guess I should apologize for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe only have the two weeks,\u201d Paul explained.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be back in Seattle after the training, won\u2019t you?\u201d Brian asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but...\u201d Paul hesitated and glanced at Ruth.</p><p>\u201cWe only just met and...\u201d Ruth let the rest fade away. He would be back and they\u2019d see each other again, but only if she could accept his career in the military.</p><p>This fourteen-day period was a testing time for them both, and at the end they had a decision to make.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving Ruth two weeks to fall head over heels in love with me.\u201d Paul said it as if it were a joke.</p> <p>\u201cIf she doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s definitely something wrong with her,\u201d Carley joked back.</p><p>Ruth smiled, but she felt her heart sinking. She hadn\u2019t made her decision yet; the truth was, she\u2019d been putting it off until the last possible minute.</p><p>Time was dwindling and soon, in a matter of days, Paul would be leaving again. She wasn\u2019t ready\u2014wasn\u2019t ready to decide and wasn\u2019t ready for him to go.</p><p>Brian and Carley had to be home before eight because of their babysitter, so they left the restaurant first.</p><p>Ruth had enjoyed the spicy enchiladas, the margarita and especially the teasing between Paul and Brian. Carley had told story after story of the two boys and their high-school exploits, and they\u2019d all laughed and joked together.</p><p>Paul and Ruth lingered in the booth over cups of dark coffee, gazing into each other\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d switched places so he could sit across from her. If she\u2019d met him under any other circumstance, there\u2019d be no question about her feelings. None! It was so easy to fall in love with this man. In fact, it was already too late; even Paul\u2019s mother had seen that. Ruth knew him. After all the letters and e-mails, all the conversations, she felt as if he\u2019d become part of her life.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Paul said unexpectedly.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I thinking?\u201d she asked with amusement.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wondering why I find life in the military so attractive.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cClose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know my answer?\u201d</p><p>Ruth was already aware of his reasons, but decided to hear him out, anyway. \u201cSure, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the structure, the discipline, the knowledge that I\u2019m doing something positive to bring about freedom and democracy in the world.\u201d</p><p>This was where it got troubling for Ruth.</p><p>Before she could state her own feelings, Paul stopped her. \u201cI know you don\u2019t agree with me, and I accept that, but I am who I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t challenge that\u2014I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, then reached for his coffee and held it at arm\u2019s length, cupping his hands around the mug. \u201cTrue enough, but the minute I started talking, you looked like you wanted to challenge my answer.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t known her feelings were that transparent.</p><p>\u201cI guess now is as good a time as any to ask where I stand with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d An uneasy feeling began to creep up her spine. They had only a couple of days before he was scheduled to leave, and she was going to need every minute of that time to concentrate on this relationship.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019m asking, Ruth.\u201d</p><p>She did. She met his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you, Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you, too.\u201d He stretched his hand across the table and intertwined their fingers.</p><p>Her heart nearly sprang out of her chest with happiness and yet tears filled her eyes.</p><p>To her astonishment, Paul laughed. \u201cThis is supposed to be a happy moment,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI am happy, but I\u2019m afraid, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf you leaving again. Of your involvement in the military. Of you fighting in a war, any war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Still, she had a hard time reconciling her emotions and beliefs with the way Paul chose to make his living.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said, his voice hard.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sighed harshly. \u201cThen tell me where we go from here.\u201d</p><p>Ruth wished she knew. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes pleaded with her. \u201cI can\u2019t answer it for you, Ruth. You\u2019re going to have to make up your mind about us.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known it would come down to this. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>He considered her words. \u201cWhen do you think you\u2019ll be able to decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait until you\u2019ve finished your training and we see each other again.... We\u2019ll both have a better idea then, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I might not be coming back to Seattle. I have to know soon. Now. Tonight.\u201d He paused. \u201cI sound unfair and pushy, and I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApologize for what?\u201d she asked. Her hand tightened around his fingers. Already she could feel him pulling away from her, if not physically, then emotionally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trained to be decisive. Putting things off only leads to confusion. We\u2019ve been writing for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve spent every possible minute of my leave together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Ruth, but I won\u2019t lie to you. I\u2019m not leaving the marines. I\u2019ve chosen the military as my career and that means I could be involved in conflicts all over the world. I have to know if you can accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t, we need to walk away from each other right now. I don\u2019t want to drag this out. You decide.\u201d</p><p>Ruth didn\u2019t want a part-time husband. \u201cI want a man who\u2019ll be a husband to me and a father to my children. A man of peace, not war.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to sound so adamant.</p><p>Paul didn\u2019t respond for a long moment. \u201cI think we have our answer.\u201d He slid out of the booth and waited for her. They\u2019d paid their tab earlier, so there was nothing to do but walk out the door to the parking lot.</p><p>Ruth wasn\u2019t finished with the conversation, even if Paul was. \u201cI need time,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cThe decision\u2019s made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pressuring me,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019ve still got two days, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t fair!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already admitted it wasn\u2019t.\u201d He opened the passenger door, and a moment later, he joined her in the car. \u201cI wish now I\u2019d waited and we still had those two days,\u201d he said bleakly. \u201cBut we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He started the car and Ruth noticed that his fingers had tensed on the steering wheel.</p><p>Ruth bit her lip. \u201cSure we do. Let\u2019s just pretend we didn\u2019t have this conversation and enjoy the time we have left. You can do that, can\u2019t you?\u201d Her voice took on a pleading quality.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could, but...I can\u2019t.\u201d He inhaled deeply. \u201cThe decision is made.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t have much to say during the rest of the ride to the university district. When Paul pulled up in front of the rental house, Ruth noticed the lights were on, which meant Lynn was home.</p><p>They sat side by side in the car without speaking until Paul roused himself to open the car door. He walked around to escort her from the passenger side. Silently he walked her to the porch.</p><p>Ruth half expected him to kiss her. He didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWill I see you again?\u201d she asked as he began to walk away.</p><p>He turned back and stood there, stiff and formal. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean this is it? This is goodbye...as if I meant nothing...as if we were strangers?\u201d She felt outraged that he could just leave her like this, without a word. It was unkind and unfair...and life wasn\u2019t that simple.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything left to say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course there is,\u201d she cried. She didn\u2019t know what, but surely there was something. Hurting and angry, Ruth gestured wildly with her arms. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious! Are you really going to walk away? Just like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word was devoid of emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to write me again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>This was unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cCall me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cIn other words, you\u2019re going to act as if you\u2019d never even met me, as if I\u2019d never mailed that Christmas card.\u201d</p><p>A hint of a smile flickered over his tightly controlled features. \u201cI\u2019m certainly going to give it my best shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, then,\u201d she muttered. If he thought so little of her, then he could do as he wished. She didn\u2019t want to be with a man who didn\u2019t care about her feelings, just his own.</p><p>Nine</p><p>True to Paul\u2019s word, Ruth didn\u2019t hear from him after their Tuesday-night dinner with Carley and Brian. The first day, her anger carried her. Then she convinced herself that Paul would contact her before he left for Camp Pendleton. Not so. Paul Gordon\u2014correction, Sergeant Paul Gordon, USMC, was out of her life and that was perfectly fine with her. Only it wasn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A week later, as she sat in her \u201cTheories of Learning\u201d class, taking notes, her determination faltered. She wanted to push all thoughts of Paul out of her mind forever; instead, he was constantly there.</p><p>What upset her most was the cold-blooded way in which he\u2019d dismissed her from his life. It seemed so easy for him, so...simple. She was gone for him, as if she meant nothing. That hurt, and it didn\u2019t stop hurting.</p><p>Ruth blinked, forcing herself to listen to the lecture. If she flunked this class, Paul Gordon would be to blame.</p><p>After class she walked across campus, her steps slow and deliberate. She felt no urge to hurry. But when her cell phone rang, she nearly dropped her purse in her eagerness. Could it be Paul? Had he changed his mind? Had he found it impossible to forget her, the same way she had him? A dozen more questions flew through her mind before she managed to answer.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d She realized she sounded excited and breathless at the same time.</p><p>\u201cRuth.\u201d The familiar voice of a longtime friend, Lori Dupont, greeted her. They talked for a few minutes, and arranged to meet at the library at the end of the week. Four minutes after she\u2019d answered her cell, it was back in her purse.</p><p>She was too restless to sit at home and study, which was how she\u2019d spent every night since her last date with Paul, so she decided to go out. That was what she needed, she told herself with strained enthusiasm. Find people, friends, a party. Something to do, somewhere to be.</p><p>Although it was midafternoon, she took the bus down to the waterfront, where she\u2019d met Paul the first night. That wasn\u2019t a smart idea. She wasn\u2019t up to dealing with memories. Before she could talk herself out of it, Ruth hopped on the Bremerton ferry. A visit with her grandmother would lift her spirits in a way nothing else could. Besides, if Helen felt strong enough, she wanted to hear the rest of the story, especially the role her grandfather had played.</p><p>As she stepped off the foot ferry from Bremerton to Cedar Cove, it occurred to Ruth that she should\u2019ve phoned first. But it was unlikely her grandmother would be away. Even if she was, Ruth figured she could wander around Cedar Cove for a while. That would help fill the void threatening to swallow her whole.</p> <p>The trudge up the hill that led to her grandmother\u2019s house seemed twice as steep and three times as long. Funny, when she\u2019d been with Paul, the climb hadn\u2019t even winded her. That was because she\u2019d been laughing and joking with him, she remembered\u2014and wished she hadn\u2019t. Alone, hands shoved in her pockets, she felt drained of energy.</p><p>Reaching 5-B Poppy Lane, she saw that the front door to her grandmother\u2019s duplex stood open, although the old-fashioned wooden screen was shut. The last remaining tulips bloomed in primary colors as vivid as the rainbow. Walking up the steps, Ruth rang the doorbell. \u201cGrandma! Are you home?\u201d</p><p>No one answered. \u201cGrandma?\u201d</p><p>Alarm jolted through her. Had something happened to her grandmother? She pounded on the door and was even more alarmed when a white-haired woman close to her grandmother\u2019s age came toward her.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the older lady said pleasantly. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for my grandmother.\u201d</p> <p>The woman unlatched the screen door and swung it open. \u201cYou must be Ruth. I don\u2019t think Helen was expecting you. I\u2019m Charlotte Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte,\u201d Ruth repeated. \u201cHelen\u2019s spoken of you so often. It\u2019s wonderful to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Charlotte said, taking Ruth\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m happy to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>Ruth nodded, but she couldn\u2019t help blurting out, \u201cIs anything wrong with my grandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, not at all. We\u2019re sitting on the patio, talking and knitting. Helen\u2019s counting stitches and asked me to get the door. She assumed it was a salesman and my job was to get rid of him...or her.\u201d Charlotte laughed. \u201cNot that I\u2019m much good at that. Just the other day, a Girl Scout came to my door selling cookies. When I bought four boxes, she announced that every kid comes to my house first, because I\u2019ll buy anything. Especially for charity.\u201d</p><p>Ruth grinned. \u201cI think my grandmother must be like that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think she sent me to the door?\u201d Charlotte joked. \u201cYour grandmother\u2019s decided to knit a Fair Isle sweater. It\u2019s her first one and she asked me over to get her started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should come back at a more convenient time?\u201d Ruth didn\u2019t want to interrupt the two women.</p> <p>\u201cNonsense! She\u2019d never forgive me if you left. Besides, I was just gathering my things to head on home. My husband will be wondering what\u2019s kept me so long.\u201d Charlotte led the way through the house to the patio.</p><p>As soon as Ruth stepped onto the brick patio, her grandmother\u2019s eyes lit up with pleasure. \u201cRuth! What a welcome surprise.\u201d</p><p>Ruth bent forward and kissed Helen\u2019s cheek.</p><p>Charlotte Rhodes collected her knitting, saying she\u2019d talk to Helen at the Senior Center on Monday, and left.</p><p>\u201cSit down, sit down,\u201d Helen urged, motioning at the chair next to her. \u201cHelp yourself to iced tea if you\u2019d like.\u201d Strands of yarn were wrapped around both index fingers as she held the needles. One was red, the other white. \u201cYou can find a glass, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course, but I\u2019m fine,\u201d Ruth assured her, enjoying the sunshine and the sights and sounds of Cedar Cove. The earth in her grandmother\u2019s garden smelled warm and clean\u2014the way it only smelled in spring. Inhaling deeply, Ruth sat down, staring at the cove with its sparkling blue water.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Paul?\u201d her grandmother asked, as if noticing for the first time that he wasn\u2019t with her.</p><p>Ruth\u2019s serenity was instantly destroyed and she struggled to disguise her misery. \u201cHe went to the marines camp in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Her grandmother seemed disappointed. \u201cI imagine you miss him.\u201d</p><p>Ruth decided to let the comment slide.</p><p>\u201cI liked him a great deal,\u201d her grandmother said, rubbing salt into Ruth\u2019s already wounded heart. Helen\u2019s focus was on her knitting, but when Ruth didn\u2019t immediately respond, she looked up.</p><p>Ruth met her eyes and exhaled forcefully. \u201cWould you mind if we didn\u2019t discuss Paul?\u201d</p><p>Her request was met with a puzzled glance. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Ruth figured she might as well tell her. \u201cWe won\u2019t be seeing each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s expression was downcast. \u201cI thought highly of that young man. Any particular reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually,\u201d Ruth muttered, \u201cthere are several. He\u2019s in the military, which you already know.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother carefully set her knitting aside and reached for her glass of iced tea, giving Ruth her full attention. \u201cYou knew that when you first met, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did, but I assumed that in time he\u2019d be released from his commitment and return to civilian life. He told me that won\u2019t be the case, that the military\u2019s his career.\u201d In for the long haul, as he\u2019d put it. Granted, she\u2019d known about his dedication to the marines from the beginning, but he\u2019d known about her feelings, too. Did her preferences matter less than his?</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Her grandmother studied her.</p><p>Ruth wondered if she truly did. \u201cWhat really upsets me is the heartless way he left. I told him I wasn\u2019t sure I could live with the fact that he\u2019d chosen the military.\u201d The memory angered her, and she raised her voice. \u201cThen Paul had the audacity to say that I wouldn\u2019t be hearing from him again and he...he just walked away.\u201d Ruth hadn\u2019t planned to spill out the whole story minutes after she arrived, but she couldn\u2019t hold it inside a second longer.</p><p>Her grandmother\u2019s response shocked her into silence. Helen smiled.</p><p>\u201cForgive me,\u201d her grandmother said gently, leaning forward to give Ruth\u2019s hand a small squeeze. \u201cSam did something similar, you see.\u201d</p><p>The irritation died instantly. \u201cI wanted to ask you about my grandfather.\u201d</p><p>A peaceful look came over Helen. \u201cHe was a wonderful man. And he saved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the Germans, you mean?\u201d</p><p>Helen shook her head. \u201cTechnically, it was General Patton and the Third Army who saved us. Patton knew what Buchenwald was. He knew that a three-hour wait meant twenty-thousand lives because the Germans had been given orders to kill all prisoners before surrendering. Against every rule of caution, Patton mounted an attack, cutting off the SS troops from the camp. Because of his decisive move, the Germans were forced to flee or surrender. By that time, the German soldiers knew they were defeated. They threw down their guns and surrendered. Sam was with Patton on the march, so, yes, he contributed to my rescue and that of countless others. But when I say your grandfather saved me, I mean he saved me from myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to hear about him, if you\u2019re willing to tell me.\u201d Ruth straightened, perching on the edge of her seat.</p><p>Her grandmother closed her eyes. \u201cI cannot speak about the years in Buchenwald, not even to you.\u201d</p><p>Ruth reached for Helen\u2019s hand, stroking the soft skin over the gnarled and prominent knuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, Grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to die, wished it with all my heart. Without Jean-Claude, it was harder to live than to die. Living was the cruelest form of punishment.\u201d Tears pooled in her eyes and she blinked them away.</p><p>\u201cWhen the Americans arrived,\u201d Helen continued, \u201cthe gates were opened and we were free. It was a delicious feeling\u2014freedom always is\u2014but one never appreciates it until it\u2019s taken away. The soldiers spoke English, and I went to them and explained that I was an American. I had no identification or anything to prove my claim, so I kept repeating the address where my parents lived in New York. I was desperate to get word to them that I was alive. They hadn\u2019t heard from me in almost five years.</p><p>\u201cOne of the soldiers brought me to their headquarters. I was completely emaciated, and I\u2019m sure the stench of me was enough to nauseate anyone standing within twenty feet. The young man then took me to his lieutenant, whose name was Sam Shelton. From that moment forward, Sam took care of me. He saw that I had food and water, clothes and access to showers and anything else I needed.\u201d</p><p>Ruth shuddered at the thought of her grandmother\u2019s physical and mental condition following her release.</p><p>Her grandmother paused to take a deep breath, and when she spoke again, it was in another language, what Ruth assumed was German. Pressing her hand on Helen\u2019s, she stopped her. \u201cGrandma, English, please.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother frowned. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas that German?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, eyes wild and confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>After all those years inside a German camp, it made sense that she\u2019d revert to the language. In her mind she\u2019d gone back to that time, was reliving each incident.</p><p>\u201cGo on. Please,\u201d Ruth urged.</p><p>Helen sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much about those first days of freedom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ruth could understand that easily enough.</p><p>\u201cStill, every memory I have is of the lieutenant at my side, watching over me. I was hospitalized, and I think I slept almost around the clock for three days straight, waking only long enough to eat and drink. Yet every time I opened my eyes, Sam was there. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not possible, but that\u2019s how I remember it.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her tea with a trembling hand and sipped the cool liquid. \u201cAfter a week\u2014maybe more, I don\u2019t know, time meant nothing to me\u2014I was transported out of Germany and placed on a ship going to America. Sam wrote out his name and home address in Washington State and gave it to me. I didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you keep it?\u201d Ruth asked.</p> <p>\u201cI did,\u201d Helen confessed, \u201calthough I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever need it. By the time I got back to New York, I was still skin and bone. My own parents didn\u2019t even recognize me. My mother looked at me, covered her face and burst into tears. I was twenty-four years old, and I felt sixty.\u201d</p><p>Ruth was in her twenties and couldn\u2019t imagine living through any of what her grandmother had described.</p><p>\u201cFive months after I arrived, Sam Shelton knocked on my parents\u2019 brownstone. I\u2019d gained weight and my hair had grown back, and when I saw him I barely remembered who he was. He visited for two days and we talked. He\u2019d come to see how I was adjusting to life back in America.\u201d</p><p>Ruth had wondered about that, too. It couldn\u2019t have been easy.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t done very well. My parents owned a small bakery and I worked at the counter, but I had no life in me, no joy. Now that I was free, I felt I had nothing to live for. My husband was dead, and I was the one who\u2019d killed him. I told this American soldier, whom I barely knew, all of this. I told him I preferred to die. I told him everything\u2014not one thing did I hold back. He listened and didn\u2019t interrupt me with questions, and when I was finished he took my hand and kissed it.\u201d The tears came again, spilling down her cheeks. \u201cHe said I was the bravest woman he\u2019d ever known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think you are, too,\u201d Ruth said, her voice shaky.</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019d finished, Sam told me he was part of D day,\u201d Helen said. \u201cHis company was one of the first to land on Omaha Beach. He spoke of the fighting there and the bravery of his men. He\u2019d seen death the same way I had. Later, in the midst of the fighting, he\u2019d stumbled across the body of his own brother. He had no time to mourn him. He didn\u2019t understand why God had seen fit to spare him and not his brother.</p><p>\u201cThis lieutenant asked the very questions I\u2019d been asking myself. I didn\u2019t know why I should live when I\u2019d rather have died with Jean-Claude\u2014or instead of him.\u201d She paused again, as if to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, Sam said he\u2019d needed to do a lot of thinking and praying, and it came to him that his brother, his men had sacrificed their lives so that others could live in freedom. God had spared him, and me, too, and it wasn\u2019t up to either of us to question why. As for Jean-Claude and Tim, Sam\u2019s brother, they had died in this terrible but necessary war. For either of us to throw away our lives now would be to dishonor them\u2014my husband and Sam\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was right, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother nodded. \u201cSam left after that one visit. He wished me well and said he hoped I\u2019d keep in touch. I waited a week before I wrote the first letter. Sam hadn\u2019t given me many details of his war experiences, but deep down I knew they\u2019d been as horrific as my own. In that, we had a bond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you and Grandpa Sam wrote letters to each other.\u201d</p><p>Helen nodded again. \u201cFor six months we wrote, and every day I found more questions for him to answer. His letters were messages of encouragement and hope for us both. Oh, Ruth, how I wish you\u2019d had the opportunity to know your grandfather. He was wise and kind and loving. He gave me a reason to live, a reason to go on. He taught me I could love again\u2014and then he asked me to marry him.\u201d Helen drew in a deep breath. \u201cSam wrote and asked me to be his wife, and I said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refused?\u201d Ruth asked, hardly able to believe it.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t leave my parents a second time.... Oh, I had a dozen excuses, all of them valid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he convince you?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was back. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. In those days, one didn\u2019t hop on a plane or even use the phone unless it was a dire emergency. For two weeks he was silent. No letters and no contact. Nothing. When I didn\u2019t hear from him, I knew I never would again.\u201d</p><p>This was the reason her grandmother had smiled when Ruth told her she hadn\u2019t heard from Paul.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it,\u201d Helen admitted. \u201cThis soldier had become vitally important to me. For the first time since Jean-Claude died, I could feel. I could laugh and cry. I knew Sam was the one who\u2019d lifted this heavy burden of pain from my shoulders. Not only that, he loved me. Loved me,\u201d she repeated, \u201cand I\u2019d turned him down when he asked me to share his life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you do next?\u201d</p><p>Helen smiled at the memory. \u201cI sent a telegram that said three words. Yes. Yes. Yes. Then I boarded a train and five days later, I arrived in Washington State. When I stepped off the platform, my suitcase in hand, Sam was there with his entire family. We were married two weeks later. I knew no one, so he introduced me to his best friends and the women they loved. Winifred and Clara became my dearest friends. They were the people who helped me adjust to normal life. They helped me find my new identity.\u201d She shook her head slowly. \u201cNot once in all the years your grandfather and I were together did I have a single regret.\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s eyes remained teary. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful love story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re living one of your own.\u201d</p><p>Ruth didn\u2019t see it like that. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a military wife,\u201d she said adamantly. \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love Paul.\u201d</p><p>Ruth noted that her grandmother hadn\u2019t made it a question. She knew that Ruth\u2019s heart was linked with Paul\u2019s. He was an honorable man, and he loved her. They didn\u2019t have to share the same political beliefs as long as they respected each other\u2019s views.</p><p>\u201cYes, Grandma, I love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you miss him the same way I missed Sam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d It was freeing to Ruth to admit it. The depression that had hung over her for the past week lifted.</p><p>All at once Ruth knew exactly what she was going to do. Her decision was made.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Barbara Gordon answered the doorbell, and the moment she saw Ruth, her eyes lit with delight. \u201cRuth, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u201d</p><p>Ruth was instantly ushered into the house. She hadn\u2019t been sure what kind of reception to expect. After all, she\u2019d disappointed and possibly hurt the Gordons\u2019 son.</p><p>\u201cI was so hoping you\u2019d stop by,\u201d Barbara continued as she led the way into the kitchen.</p><p>Obediently Ruth followed. \u201cI came because I don\u2019t have a current address for Paul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou plan on writing him?\u201d Barbara seemed about to leap up and down and clap her hands.</p><p>\u201cActually, no.\u201d</p><p>The happiness drained from the other woman\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a bit old-fashioned, but I thought I\u2019d send him a telegram.\u201d</p><p>The delight was back in place. \u201cGreg,\u201d she shouted over her shoulder. \u201cRuth is here.\u201d</p><p>Almost immediately Paul\u2019s father joined them in the kitchen. His grin was as wide as his wife\u2019s had been. \u201cGood to see you, good to see you,\u201d he said expansively.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d Barbara insisted.</p><p>The two of them continued to stand there and stare at her.</p><p>\u201cAbout Paul\u2019s address?\u201d Ruth prodded.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d As if she\u2019d woken from a trance, Barbara Gordon hurried into the other room, leaving Ruth alone with Paul\u2019s father.</p><p>It was awkward at first, and Ruth felt the least she could do was explain the reason for her visit. \u201cI miss Paul so much,\u201d she told him. \u201cI need his address.\u201d</p><p>Greg Gordon nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s missing you, too. Big-time.\u201d</p><p>Ruth\u2019s heart filled with hope. \u201cHe said that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in those exact words,\u201d Greg stated matter-of-factly. \u201cBut rest assured, my son is pretty miserable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Now it was Ruth who wanted to leap up and down and clap her hands.</p><p>\u201cMy son is miserable and you\u2019re happy?\u201d Greg asked, but a teasing light glinted in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes...no...Yes,\u201d she quickly amended. \u201cI just hope he\u2019s been as miserable as I have.\u201d</p><p>Greg\u2019s smile faded. \u201cNo question there.\u201d</p><p>The phone rang once; Barbara must have answered it right away, and within a few minutes she returned to the kitchen, carrying a portable phone. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d</p><p>Greg started toward her.</p><p>\u201cNot you, honey,\u201d she said, nodding at Ruth. \u201cThe call is for Ruth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She was startled. No one knew she\u2019d come here. Anyone wanting to reach her would automatically use her cell-phone number. Her frown quickly disappeared as she realized who it must be.</p><p>\u201cIs it Paul?\u201d she asked, her voice low and hopeful.</p><p>\u201cIt is. He thinks Greg\u2019s about to get on the line.\u201d She clasped her husband\u2019s elbow. \u201cCome on, honey, let\u2019s give Ruth and Paul some privacy.\u201d She was halfway out of the room when she turned back, caught Ruth\u2019s eye and winked.</p><p>That was just the encouragement Ruth needed. Still, she felt decidedly nervous as she picked up the portable phone resting on the kitchen counter. After the way they\u2019d parted, she didn\u2019t know what to expect or how to react.</p><p>\u201cHello, Paul,\u201d she said, hoping to sound calm and confident, neither of which she was.</p><p>Her greeting was followed by a slight hesitation. \u201cRuth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201d Her voice sounded downright cheerful\u2014and more than a little forced.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing at my parents\u2019 place?\u201d he asked gruffly.</p><p>\u201cVisiting.\u201d</p><p>Again he paused, as if he wasn\u2019t sure what to make of this. \u201cI\u2019d like to speak to my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, he and your mother stepped out of the room so you and I could talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d He hadn\u2019t warmed to her yet.</p><p>\u201cYour calling ruins everything,\u201d she told him. \u201cI was going to send you a telegram. My grandmother sent one to my grandfather sixty years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA telegram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s outdated. It\u2019s also rather romantic, I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you intend to say in this telegram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t decided. My first idea was to say the same thing Helen said to my grandfather. It was a short message\u2014just three little words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you?\u201d He was warming up now.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d He seemed skeptical. \u201cWhat else could it be? Helen loved him, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, but that was already understood. Oh, Paul, I heard the rest of the story and it\u2019s so beautiful, so compelling, you\u2019ll see why she loved him as much as she did. Sam helped her look to the future and step out of the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re avoiding the question,\u201d he said.</p><p>That confused her for a moment. \u201cWhat\u2019s the question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you love me enough to accept me as a marine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sending that answer by way of Western Union.\u201d The answer that was going to change her life...</p><p>\u201cYou can tell me now,\u201d he offered casually.</p><p>\u201cBefore I do, you have to promise, on your word of honor as a United States marine, that you\u2019ll never walk away from me like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it was easy?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it was easy or not, you can\u2019t ever do it again.\u201d His abandonment had hurt too much.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll never walk away from you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord of honor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord of honor,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>He\u2019d earned it now. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about you, Paul Gordon. Crazy. Crazy in love with you. If having the marines as your career means that much to you, then I\u2019ll adjust. I\u2019ll find a way to make it work. But you need to compromise, too, when it comes to my career. I can\u2019t just leave a teaching job in order to follow you somewhere.\u201d</p><p>The last thing Ruth expected after her admission was a long stretch of silence.</p> <p>Then, \u201cAre you serious? You\u2019ll accept my being in the military?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you think I\u2019d do this otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut what you don\u2019t know is that I\u2019ve been thinking about giving up the marines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d Never once had it occurred to Ruth that he\u2019d consider such a thing.</p><p>\u201cMy dad and I have had a couple of long talks about it,\u201d he went on to say.</p><p>\u201cTell me more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou already know this part\u2014I\u2019m crazy about you, too. I wasn\u2019t convinced I could find a way to live the rest of my life without you. One option I\u2019ve looked into is training. I\u2019ve already talked to my commander about it, and he thinks it\u2019s a good possibility I\u2019d be able to stay in the marines, but I\u2019d be stationed in one place for a while.\u201d</p><p>Ruth slumped onto a kitchen stool, feeling deliciously weak, too weak to stay upright. \u201cOh, Paul, that\u2019s wonderful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt like a fool,\u201d he said. \u201cI made my big stand, and I honestly felt I was right, but I didn\u2019t have to force you to decide that very minute. My pride wouldn\u2019t allow me to back off, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPride carried me the first week,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I went to see my grandmother, and she told me how she met my grandfather at the end of the war. Their romance was as much of an adventure as everything else she told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a very special woman,\u201d Paul said. \u201cJust like her granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear it. I\u2019m just wondering if history might repeat itself,\u201d Paul murmured.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if someday you\u2019ll be my bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the perfect question,\u201d Ruth said, and it was perfect for what she had in mind.</p><p>She closed her eyes and sighed deeply. \u201cI do believe I\u2019ll send you that telegram after all.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Yes. Yes.</p><p>Helen Shelton</p><p>5-B Poppy Lane</p><p>Cedar Cove, Washington May 9</p><p>Dear Winifred, It\u2019s time to celebrate\u2014your birthday and my granddaughter\u2019s engagement. Yes, Ruth has agreed to marry Paul Gordon, the young man she introduced me to in April. They\u2019ve decided to have a December wedding in Oregon, where her family lives. Paul is a fine young man and I feel she\u2019s chosen well. Yes, my dear friend, I\u2019ll meet you in Seattle and we\u2019ll board the ferry for Victoria together. It\u2019s been far too long since we\u2019ve had an extended visit. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing about your granddaughters. I\u2019m feeling good. Ruth and my sons know all about my war adventures. It was time, as you\u2019ve been telling me all these years. Ruth has the tapes and is making copies for everyone in the family. She claims this is more than family history, this is history. Maybe she\u2019s right.... I\u2019ll see you next week. The warmest of wishes,</p><p>Helen LIBERTY HALL</p><p>Lois Faye Dyer</p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p>My thanks to explosives expert Skeeter Burnett</p><p>for sharing his knowledge; to Paula Eykelhof,</p><p>Meg Ruley and Christina Hogrebe for their</p><p>compassion and understanding; and to my</p><p>critique group, my children, sisters,</p><p>brother and friends for support</p><p>above and beyond the call of duty.</p><p>Dear Reader,</p><p>I grew up listening to my grandparents relaying stories about \u201cthe war years.\u201d The courage and dedication of ordinary citizens who donned uniforms and left their homes to defend our country never failed to leave me awed and amazed. It was difficult to imagine my charming Uncle Bill as a sailor in the Pacific, or Uncles Karl and Knute as soldiers in North Africa. They were funny and lovable and kind\u2014how could they be warriors?</p><p>As an adult, it is just as awe inspiring to me to hear reports of our military men and women. Thus, the opportunity to explore whether a cautious English professor like Chloe Abbott and a battle-hardened soldier like Jake Morrissey could find a future together was irresistible.</p><p>I\u2019m delighted to be sharing this collection with two of my favorite authors and dear friends, Debbie Macomber and Katherine Stone.

My bridge club loved it and I feel quite proud to have an \u201capple expert\u201d as my dear friend.:-)</p><p>The postman brought a letter from Helen yesterday. (We must find a way to convince her to try the World Wide Web so she can share morning e-mail with us!) I was so pleased to learn she\u2019s talked to her granddaughter about her wartime experiences. I confess I was a bit surprised that she chose her granddaughter, Ruth, as her confidante\u2014I thought she might have told her son first. But I don\u2019t think it matters who she told, as long as she told someone in her family. As far as I know, Ruth is the first person Helen has talked to about her involvement in the French Underground\u2014except for her husband, me and you, Clara.</p><p>I\u2019ve never forgotten her torment and the pain in her eyes when she told us. I think that was the moment when the three of us bonded, crying together in her hotel room while our husbands waited downstairs in the lobby with Sam. She seemed so fragile, clutching her wedding bouquet. Remember how she wept when she told us about losing her husband in France? And how worried she was about whether she was being fair to Sam by marrying him when she was still devastated by what happened in France? I\u2019m so glad we were there to support her that morning and convince her to go through with her wedding, especially since her marriage to Sam turned out so well. Now that she\u2019s shared her secrets with Ruth, too, I\u2019m hopeful she\u2019ll find a measure of peace.</p><p>Helen\u2019s note said her granddaughter\u2019s in love! There must be something in the air this spring\u2014first we learn your granddaughter, Elizabeth, is engaged and now Helen\u2019s Ruth finds love with Paul. I\u2019m so delighted for both of you. What happy times are in store for you and Helen with engagements, weddings and great-grandchildren on the horizon.</p><p>I confess I\u2019m envious, Clara, since my own three granddaughters show no signs of hurrying toward marriage. Chloe, Alexie and Lily are busy with their careers, and when I ask them about marriage, their response inevitably is \u201cno time, Gran.\u201d Sigh. Perhaps I should try a bit of matchmaking, since I\u2019m apparently the only one with free time to search for husbands for them. :-)</p><p>I do wish we lived closer so I could pop in and visit you daily for coffee and a nice long chat. I vividly remember how difficult it was for me the first year after I lost my Richard. He\u2019s been gone for six years now, and although I still miss him every day, the awful sadness and sense of being lost and adrift gradually eased. I know the grief will grow less for you, too, Clara, but until it does, please remember you can call me anytime, day or night, if you need to talk. I\u2019m sure Helen would say the same.</p><p>I must stop chattering and get busy\u2014I have a Women\u2019s Club meeting today. We\u2019re working with the Rehabilitation Department at the University of Washington Medical Center on a project that\u2019s dear to my heart. I\u2019ve even convinced Chloe to get involved\u2014such fun to work with my granddaughter! Have a wonderful day, Clara. Talk to you soon...</p><p>All my love,</p><p>Winifred</p><p>One</p><p>Jake Morrissey strode down the hall at the University of Washington Medical Center, scanning the signs above the doors until he found one that read Rehabilitation Medicine. He pushed open the big double doors and looked for his friend, Dan.</p><p>The room was surprisingly uncrowded. Across from him, two women talked with a doctor wearing a lab coat. The white-haired older woman and the doctor faced him, the other woman had her back to him.</p><p>And a very nice back it was. Tall and slender, she wore a simple, curve-hugging white dress, and her black hair was a sleek fall that brushed her shoulders.</p><p>Classy, he thought. Wonder what the front view is like.</p><p>A nurse in operating-room scrubs joined the group, and the brunette turned to greet her. She smiled, her eyes glowing emerald-green against fair skin, her face lit with amusement as she spoke to the nurse.</p><p>Jake went from idle appreciation of a beautiful female to serious lust. The unusual reaction stunned him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sarge.\u201d Dan\u2019s voice broke the spell that held Jake motionless, staring at the brunette. He turned to his right and saw Dan, seated in a wheelchair farther down the room. A male nurse walked behind him, but the young soldier himself propelled the chair.</p><p>\u201cDan.\u201d Jake moved toward him and the two met halfway.</p><p>A broad grin split the young marine\u2019s face as they shook hands. \u201cMan, it\u2019s good to see you! What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been out of town. I didn\u2019t know you were in Seattle until I flew back last night. I found out the VA Hospital sent you here for experimental therapy when I talked to Tomaselli around midnight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo kiddin\u2019\u2014you talked to Tomaselli? I heard he was back in the States and that he was shot. Didn\u2019t hear where he was or what happened, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis unit was cleaning out a nest of insurgents in the hills near the Khyber Pass in Afghanistan, and he took a bullet in his leg.\u201d Jake glanced downward. \u201cThat\u2019s where they got you, too, he told me. Right leg or left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft.\u201d Dan shifted the lap robe to reveal a prosthetic attached just below his knee.</p><p>\u201cDamn. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jake said with feeling. \u201cTomaselli didn\u2019t tell me you lost the leg.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell, Jake. I didn\u2019t lose it. I know exactly where it went.\u201d Dan grinned and Jake laughed, shaking his head. But before he could say anything, Dan looked past him and grimaced. \u201cHang around, will you?\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta do some PR stuff. I promised the doc\u2014and I could use some backup.\u201d</p><p>Jake glanced over his shoulder, following Dan\u2019s gaze. The pretty brunette and the small group she\u2019d been talking with were walking in their direction. They\u2019d been joined by a midthirties woman in jeans and sweater and a tall lanky guy with cameras slung around his neck.</p><p>\u201cPR?\u201d He looked back at Dan.</p><p>\u201cYeah. A newspaper reporter is doing a story on the equipment in here.\u201d</p><p>That takes care of the guy with the cameras and the woman in jeans, Jake thought. \u201cWho are the two women with the doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey must be from the Seattle Women\u2019s Club\u2014the group that donated the equipment I\u2019ve been using.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Dan murmured.</p><p>Jake stepped aside, silently observing as Dan said hello to his doctor and was introduced to the older woman, Winifred Abbott, and her granddaughter, Chloe Abbott.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sarge,\u201d a male voice called.</p><p>Chloe looked over her shoulder. A pajama-clad patient sat in a wheelchair across the room, grinning broadly at the tall, burly man walking toward him. Dressed casually in a light-blue cotton shirt tucked into belted jeans, black boots on his feet, the visitor seemed to dominate the room.</p> <p>\u201cOur patient has arrived,\u201d Dr. Jacobson said. \u201cAre you ready to talk to Dan?\u201d he asked the reporter.</p><p>\u201cIn a moment.\u201d She gestured at the male nurse and the other man standing next to the patient in the wheelchair. \u201cTony, can you get a few candid shots first?\u201d The photographer nodded, lifting his camera to focus on the trio.</p><p>Dr. Jacobson waited until the photographer lowered his camera. \u201cI think we\u2019re ready. Ladies, shall we...?\u201d He waved the reporter ahead of him, following with Winifred and Chloe.</p><p>The man talking to the patient turned and stared straight at Chloe, his eyes narrowed. She\u2019d only seen his profile earlier; now she realized that her earlier impression of \u201cgood-looking\u201d hadn\u2019t done him justice. His eyes were a bright blue in a ruggedly handsome face. Short black hair, dark eyebrows and lashes, high cheekbones and a strong jaw combined to create a sense of strength and purpose.</p><p>His eyes didn\u2019t waver from her as she crossed the room with Dr. Jacobson, and the group was introduced to Dan West, the wheelchair-bound Marine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you all to meet Jake Morrissey,\u201d Dan said after shaking their hands. \u201cTwo years ago, he was our master sergeant during my first tour of duty in the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Jake shook hands with the reporter and photographer, Dr. Jacobson and the nurse, then Winifred, before he reached Chloe.</p><p>\u201cChloe.\u201d His fingers and palm were slightly rough with calluses, engulfing her much smaller hand. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Morrissey,\u201d Chloe said politely. He held her hand a few seconds too long until she tugged discreetly. He immediately released her, a slight smile of apology curving his mouth. Amused, she smiled back at him and his gaze sharpened, holding a glint of admiration.</p><p>\u201cMr. Morrissey.\u201d The reporter claimed his attention. \u201cSince you worked with Dan, I\u2019d like to include you in the article. Do you mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He gave the reporter a half smile before looking at Chloe and Winifred. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s all right with the ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever makes the article more effective is fine with me,\u201d Winifred said. \u201cOur goal is to generate more donations to the medical center\u2019s equipment fund.\u201d</p><p>Chloe murmured her agreement.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. I\u2019d like to get some shots of you using the equipment first, Dan, then we\u2019ll take group photos.\u201d The reporter bustled off with the photographer, Dr. Jacobson and Dan in tow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing to lose a limb, especially at his age,\u201d Winifred said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a nice young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good soldier, too,\u201d Jake replied.</p><p>\u201cI believe Dan said you served together before you left the military. Are you retired, maybe playing golf full-time?\u201d Chloe asked, curious.</p><p>Jake laughed, his teeth a flash of white in his tanned face. \u201cNot hardly. I started my own company when I left the Marine Corps more than five years ago\u2014Morrissey Demolition. We\u2019re headquartered just south of Pioneer Square. And two years ago, my reserve unit was called up and I was on active duty for twelve months. I\u2019ve been back in Seattle running the company again for the past year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow interesting. What exactly do you demolish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLarge buildings, mostly. We also have a contract with the Colville Tribe\u2019s construction company. We remove boulders and rock from logging roads on their reservation in eastern Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that dangerous?\u201d Chloe tried to envision working with explosives on a daily basis.</p><p>\u201cNot if you know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Jake shrugged. \u201cI specialized in explosives in the military, and my crew has years of experience in this kind of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe,\u201d the reporter called, \u201cwill you join us, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d Chloe walked over to the small group surrounding Dan.</p><p>\u201cYou have a very attractive granddaughter, Mrs. Abbott,\u201d Jake said, watching Chloe as she bent to talk to Dan.</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><p>Jake turned his head and his gaze met Winifred\u2019s, her green eyes shrewd as she studied him.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the first man to admire Chloe,\u201d she said. She tilted her head, and a small smile raised the corners of her mouth. \u201cBut I must say you\u2019re the first one I\u2019ve thought had serious potential.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPotential?\u201d Jake repeated warily.</p><p>\u201cChloe is a strong-willed woman,\u201d Winifred continued as if Jake hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cAnd very bright. Just like my son and me, she stayed on to become a professor at the University of Washington after graduating magna cum laude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Jake said evenly. \u201cI have an engineering degree but I earned it in bits and pieces. The Marines moved me around fairly often.\u201d</p><p>Winifred waved her hand dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s not about where a person is educated, it\u2019s about how intelligent that person is in all aspects of his or her life.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cMy husband never went to college, but he was one of the most intelligent men I\u2019ve ever known. Well rounded, that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded without commenting, his eyes returning to Chloe.</p><p>\u201cShe teaches English at the University of Washington,\u201d Winifred said. \u201cHer office is in Liberty Hall, although I believe I\u2019ll let you find out her phone number yourself. And Chloe recently bought a nice little house in the Queen Anne District. Where do you live, Mr. Morrissey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an apartment on the top floor of the building I own, near Pioneer Square.\u201d Jake grinned, amused by Winifred\u2019s no-nonsense approach. \u201cI\u2019m also healthy, my bank account isn\u2019t overdrawn, I\u2019ve never been married and I don\u2019t have any children. What do you think, Mrs. Abbott? Do I pass inspection?\u201d</p><p>She laughed, her eyes gleaming with approval. \u201cYes, son, you pass. Now all you need to do is convince Chloe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might take a while. I\u2019m heading back to Vegas tonight to finish a job. It\u2019ll be four or five days before I\u2019m back in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Winifred nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019ll expect you to attend my monthly brunch two weeks from this Sunday, promptly at 1:00 p.m. I assume you\u2019ll be bringing Chloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am, I\u2019ll certainly try.\u201d Jake chuckled. The old lady was a force to be reckoned with. If Chloe was anything like her grandmother, he was in for a hell of a trip.</p><p>The Seattle Tribune lay open on the table. The article and photos taken at the UW Medical Center took up half of page six.</p><p>Rage hissed and uncoiled in his belly, spreading its heat through his veins. His fingers curled into fists, creasing the edges of the newspaper.</p><p>He reread the paragraphs, his morning routine disrupted as he ignored his customary breakfast of half a grapefruit and a single slice of rye toast, cut in a precise line from corner to corner. The mug of Starbucks coffee grew cold while he stared at the picture.</p><p>Three civilians stood next to a wounded solder in a wheelchair. The caption identified the patient as a marine private. The white-haired older woman was Winifred Abbott, a founding member of the Seattle Women\u2019s Club. The club\u2019s fund-raising had purchased the rehab equipment being used by the recovering marine. On Winifred\u2019s left was a late-twenties brunette identified as her granddaughter, Chloe Abbott.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to read the name of the man standing to the right of Chloe Abbott. Jake Morrissey was all too familiar. He\u2019d meticulously researched Morrissey for the past year and tracked his schedule and whereabouts for the past two months. Morrissey currently had a contract to implode a casino in Las Vegas; the demolition crew had been there for two weeks and weren\u2019t due to return for another two days.</p><p>He\u2019d been unaware of Morrissey\u2019s return to Seattle this week. He was sure it wasn\u2019t in the original plans for the Las Vegas job. He didn\u2019t like it when schedules changed.</p><p>The Tribune article said Master Sergeant Morrissey had once served overseas with the wounded marine.</p><p>This marine was alive.</p><p>Other young men serving with Morrissey hadn\u2019t been so lucky.</p><p>The fresh-faced marine, the older woman, the granddaughter and Morrissey smiled directly at the camera in the group photo. In a second photo, Morrissey\u2019s head was bent toward the younger woman, his lips brushing her ear as he whispered to her, and her hand rested on his forearm with intimate ease. The look on the ex-master sergeant\u2019s face said Chloe Abbott meant something to him. Their body language hinted that they knew each other well.</p><p>Despite intense covert observation of Morrissey\u2019s life over the past six weeks, he\u2019d uncovered no evidence of close family members and only casual ties to women friends. Morrissey\u2019s personal life appeared to lack anyone whose death would cause him the devastation and grief he deserved.</p><p>That situation had apparently changed.</p><p>At last. At long last.</p><p>Time for the revenge his soul craved. He had the woman\u2019s name, and he\u2019d check her out. This might be his chance to destroy Jake Morrissey\u2019s life just as his had been destroyed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All things come to those who wait.</p><p>\u201cPerfect. It\u2019s absolutely perfect.\u201d Chloe Abbott cradled the rosewood mantel clock in her hands, turning it to inspect each side. Sunlight poured through the windows of the antique shop on Fourth Avenue in Seattle, gleaming off chests of silver, displays of china and crystal, and finding deep red highlights in the clock\u2019s wooden box.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t detect a single fault with it. The wood had the fine patina of age, and when the clock struck the hour, the carved doors on the front opened. The delicate figures of two dancers in Louis IV court dress popped out to twirl to the strains of a Strauss waltz.</p><p>\u201cGran\u2019s going to love this.\u201d Delighted, Chloe set the clock carefully on the glass counter. \u201cThank you so much for finding it for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it.\u201d The shop owner, a thin, elegant man in an impeccable gray suit and tie, abandoned his normal reserve and fairly beamed at her. \u201cI knew the moment it came into the shop that it was meant for Winifred. There\u2019s only one tiny detail that detracts from its value. Someone modified the clockworks to add a modern battery-operated alarm inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, David, and I doubt Gran will, either.\u201d Chloe\u2019s eyes half closed as she swayed to the lilting music. \u201c\u2018The Blue Danube\u2019 was my grandfather\u2019s favorite waltz. Gran told me they danced to it the night they became engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seem to recall Winifred telling me that story.\u201d</p><p>Chloe opened her eyes and chuckled at his expression of fond indulgence. David McPherson had grown up with Chloe\u2019s grandmother Winifred and grandfather Richard in the community of Ballard, only a few miles from the heart of downtown Seattle. In 1943 Winifred had signed on as an assistant to her father, a cryptographer employed in the Seattle section of the Office of Strategic Services, precursor to the CIA. That same year, Richard Abbott and Winifred were married four days before he and David donned army uniforms and marched off to war. They\u2019d returned to Seattle to take up their lives after peace was won. Winifred had resumed her university studies, earning her doctorate and stayed on to become a professor of literature. Richard inherited Abbott Construction from his father, while David had opened an antique shop in downtown Seattle. Both men had been stunningly successful, and although David was widowed at forty-two and never had children, he\u2019d been adopted into Richard and Winifred\u2019s family. Chloe thought of him as a much-loved great-uncle.</p><p>Which was why, when she\u2019d wanted a special gift to mark her grandmother\u2019s eightieth birthday, she\u2019d called on David.</p> <p>\u201cOf course you remember. You were probably at the same dance.\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes twinkled. \u201cI\u2019m sure I was. In fact, I distinctly remember slipping money to the bandleader so he\u2019d play the waltz at just the right moment.\u201d</p><p>Chloe laughed and hugged him. \u201cClever, David, very clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes true love needs a helping hand,\u201d he said sagely, patting her back.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Chloe herself had never experienced true love, so she\u2019d have to take his word for it. She stepped back and looked once more at the clock, gleaming in splendor on the glass counter. \u201cI\u2019ll buy it, of course. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes to pack it properly.\u201d David walked behind the counter and disappeared through a curtained doorway.</p> <p>The antique bell mounted above the outer door chimed. Chloe smiled politely at the three older woman who entered the shop before her gaze moved on to the big display window. Outside, the sidewalks were busy, thronged with pedestrians walking briskly past. A solitary man stood motionless, looking through the glass into the interior of the shop. He was of average height and weight, dressed in khaki pants with a neatly pressed plaid shirt. Mirrored sunglasses concealed his eyes below the bill of a Mariners baseball cap that covered all but a glimpse of short-cropped black hair.</p><p>Chloe\u2019s skin prickled and she shivered. She couldn\u2019t see the man\u2019s eyes behind the dark glasses, but she had the uneasy conviction that he was staring at her. Something about his absolute stillness was unnerving. How long had he been watching her?</p><p>\u201cHere we are.\u201d David returned with a cardboard box, tissue paper and an elegant plastic bag.</p><p>Chloe turned to look at David, and when she glanced back at the window, the man was gone. Shrugging off the unsettling moment, she leaned against the counter. \u201cWhere did you find the clock?\u201d</p><p>He carefully wrapped the tissue paper around the mantel clock before slipping it into the white box with his shop logo, Elegance, in tasteful script across the top.</p><p>\u201cAt an estate sale in the Capitol Hill District. Fortunately,\u201d David told her, taping the lid of the box closed, \u201cI had the opportunity for a private viewing before the house was open to the public and I picked up several nice pieces, including this clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you find?\u201d</p><p>Chloe listened with interest as David pointed out the various newly acquired items in his chic, cluttered shop. Finally she said goodbye and left, the clock held safely in her arms within its multiple layers of packing.</p> <p>She checked her watch. She had to lecture college freshmen on the basics of English composition at two o\u2019clock. If she was lucky and there were no traffic snarls, she could make it back to the campus with ten minutes to spare. She quickened her steps as she headed toward her car and was soon driving north on Dexter Avenue before crossing the Fremont Bridge to hook up with Pacific Avenue on her way to Lake Union and the University District. The University spires were already in sight when her cell phone rang. She flipped open the phone, read the caller ID information and held the slim silver phone to her ear.</p><p>\u201cHi, Alexie, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get Gran\u2019s present?\u201d Chloe\u2019s sister didn\u2019t bother with a greeting.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it\u2019s gorgeous. You\u2019re going to love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Which one of us is picking up the cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Alexie sounded relieved. \u201cWith Mom and Lily still in England, and you and me responsible for Gran\u2019s birthday, I\u2019m a little worried that we\u2019ll forget something. Speaking of forgetting, why didn\u2019t you tell me about the guy you met at the UW Medical Center?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guy kissing you in the Tribune photo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake Morrissey? He wasn\u2019t kissing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhh, yes, he was,\u201d Alexie drawled. \u201cAnd I cut out the photo to prove it. Oops, gotta run, I\u2019m due in court in thirty minutes. We\u2019ll discuss this later. Call me after work.\u201d</p><p>Chloe turned off the phone and reached across the console to tuck it back into her purse.</p><p>She\u2019d thought Jake was interested, maybe a lot interested.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t called. She frowned. The article and photos weren\u2019t published in the Tribune until this morning\u2019s edition, but the photos had been taken three days earlier. She\u2019d been sure Jake would call and was surprised at how disappointed she felt that he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She nosed the Volvo into the stream of cars crossing the University Bridge and checked her watch again. By the time she turned onto Pacific Avenue and arrived at the north-central side of the university campus, she had just enough time to slip into a faculty parking space, grab her purse, briefcase and an armful of books, and dash across campus.</p><p>Halfway to Liberty Hall, she had the feeling that someone was following her. She looked over her shoulder, but although students crowded the sidewalk, none of their faces were familiar and none appeared to be paying particular attention to her. Frowning, she dismissed the oddly disturbing sensation and picked up her pace once again.</p><p>Chloe\u2019s freshman English classes were held in one of the original brick university buildings. The small single-story hall was used as the first campus church but during the mid-1950s, had been converted into a classroom. Now it contained only one lecture theater, accessed by students via a steep flight of concrete stairs leading to the double oak doors at the front. Professors entered at the lectern level through a side door that opened directly onto a sidewalk and the campus lawns beyond.</p><p>When Chloe walked inside, the three hundred tiered theater seats were half-filled with students. She dropped her briefcase and books on the table.</p><p>\u201cProfessor Abbott?\u201d</p><p>Chloe glanced up from organizing her lecture notes and reference books and smiled at the first-year student seated in the front row.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the article in the Tribune this morning\u2014the one about the solider in rehab? The article said your grandmother was a codebreaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she worked for the Office of Strategic Services at a satellite office here in Seattle. Her father was a cryptographer working for the OSS and he hired her as his assistant when she was only eighteen years old. She loved the work.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Chloe assigned a three-page essay as homework. Class time had been used for a lively and passionate discussion fueled by the Seattle Tribune article with the photos of Dan West, and Chloe had encouraged students to voice their views. The papers were to explore the impact made on each student\u2019s life by the wounding or death of American military personnel stationed around the globe.</p><p>\u201cThe essays are due next Wednesday. If you drop them through the door slot at my office, they have to be there no later than 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon,\u201d she said, raising her voice to be heard over the sound of books slamming shut. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget to take a copy of the handouts on the table next to the exit. The page-three article on the style of Jane Austen is part of your required reading for next week.\u201d</p><p>She gathered up her books and slung her purse over her shoulder, making a mental note to confirm with the student editor about using the Opinions section of the university newspaper. She\u2019d promised her class the winning essay would be published in the column, and the editor had agreed.</p><p>The lectern-level exit door stood ajar, letting fresh air and the scent of flowers into the hall. With her arms full, Chloe bumped the door with her shoulder to open it and the heavy metal panel crashed into something solid just outside.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Chloe peered around the edge of the door. The janitor perched on the ladder grabbed the wall next to the empty light socket above the doorjamb.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Fred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The dour, midfifties man frowned, his carrot-colored brows pulling down into a V over his beaky nose. \u201cThe light bulb isn\u2019t, though.\u201d</p><p>Chloe followed his gaze. Pieces of shattered glass lay on the concrete sidewalk. \u201cI didn\u2019t see you there behind the door. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Fred grunted an acknowledgment and descended to the walkway. \u201cI\u2019ll have to go to the maintenance shop and get another bulb. I\u2019m leaving the ladder here.\u201d</p><p>He paused, looking at her pointedly, and Chloe waved at the lawn and busy campus beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s safe from me. I\u2019m going to my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>He eyed her suspiciously before Chloe walked briskly away. The taciturn man had worked at Liberty Hall, her campus office building, for the past year and he had yet to warm up to any casual conversation beyond \u201chello.\u201d She glanced over her shoulder. He was moving the ladder, carefully arranging it against the side wall. Then he took a small hand broom and dustpan from his toolbox, knelt down and began to sweep up the broken glass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He takes his job so personally, she thought. As though the university is his own private place. But then, that\u2019s probably a good trait in a janitor.</p><p>Jake Morrissey shaded his eyes with one hand. Despite his sunglasses, the Las Vegas sun was blinding, and he narrowed his eyes against the glare. The searing heat of the desert city was light years away from the cooler Puget Sound region he\u2019d left yesterday.</p><p>He\u2019d flown out of SeaTac airport on a red-eye express to Las Vegas barely twelve hours after he\u2019d met Chloe Abbott at the UW Medical Center. There hadn\u2019t been time to talk to her again, although he could\u2019ve called her today, either on his cell or the hotel room phone. But like most of the jobs he took on, imploding the multistory casino-hotel was complicated and required all his attention. He wanted the work completed and out of the way so he could focus on Chloe. He\u2019d grabbed three hours of sleep at the hotel before heading for the job site with his crew, already looking forward to finishing and flying home.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t met a woman who intrigued him this much in years. Maybe never. The half hour he\u2019d spent talking with Chloe and her grandmother had only increased his interest.</p> <p>Chloe Abbott was beautiful, sexy, smart and had a quick, wry sense of humor. He was positive the attraction was mutual, but he was too far away to act on it.</p><p>He wanted her within reach when he talked to her, not a thousand miles away. Her grandmother had mentioned that Chloe lived in Queen Anne, a Seattle district only a ten-or fifteen-minute drive from the industrial end of First Avenue where his building was located.</p><p>Setting the explosives to implode the old casino would take roughly five more days. He\u2019d be on a flight back to Seattle by the time the dust settled.</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about the guy in the Tribune photo with you and Gran,\u201d Alexie demanded as she closed the freezer door in Winifred\u2019s kitchen. Ice-cream container in hand, she pulled open a drawer.</p> <p>Chloe groaned silently. That photo. How on earth had the photographer managed to make it look as if Jake was nibbling her ear? She lifted the cake out of its box. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re referring to the photos taken at the medical center?\u201d Her older sister wasn\u2019t likely to be distracted enough to drop the subject of Jake Morrissey, but Chloe tried.</p><p>\u201cDrank it in with my morning latte. Nice article, by the way,\u201d Alexie said.</p><p>\u201cI think so, too. The reporter did a great job and I loved that she included Gran\u2019s background as a codebreaker during World War II.\u201d Chloe slipped the three-tiered chocolate cake onto a heavy crystal cake stand.</p><p>\u201cYes, nice touch. Are you about ready with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need to put the candles on top.\u201d Chloe quickly poked ten short pink candles into the dark chocolate frosting, eyed the arrangement critically, then nodded with approval.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to you explaining the hot guy nibbling on your ear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chance. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you read the caption under the picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014it gave me his name, rank and how long he\u2019s been a civilian. What I want to hear from you is how you feel about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean how I feel about him? I just met him! We spent maybe twenty minutes talking, and most of the conversation was about the medical center and Gran. I don\u2019t even know him.\u201d Not that I don\u2019t want to, Chloe thought. She pulled open two drawers before she located a book of matches. She tucked them into the pocket of her retro, swingy pink skirt and picked up the cake plate.</p><p>Alexie\u2019s huff of disbelief spoke volumes. \u201cThe expression on Jake Morrissey\u2019s face in that photo practically singed the edges of my morning paper and you have nothing to tell me about him? The man was kissing your ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was not kissing my ear. He said something to me and I couldn\u2019t hear him. When I asked him to repeat it, he leaned closer to ask me a question about Dan West and the annoying photographer chose that moment to snap the picture. That\u2019s all there was to it.\u201d Chloe had a swift mental image of Jake Morrissey holding her hand a shade too long when they were introduced, his dark eyes filled with male interest. She\u2019d found it a bit disconcerting to have all that male intensity focused exclusively on her. Jake wasn\u2019t her usual, easygoing kind of man, but she was attracted in spite of herself and had thought he was, too. But he hadn\u2019t called.</p><p>\u201cI might believe you if I hadn\u2019t seen the look on his face.\u201d Alexie used her elbow to hold open the swinging door between the kitchen and dining room and gestured Chloe to precede her. As Chloe walked past, she hissed, \u201cThis conversation isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we should discuss your latest guy,\u201d Chloe murmured, laughing when Alexie rolled her eyes. \u201cHere we are,\u201d she announced. Winifred, seated at one end of the gleaming mahogany table, looked up.</p><p>\u201cEight candles?\u201d Winifred lifted an inquiring eyebrow, her sharp gaze sweeping Chloe and Alexie. \u201cWhy not eighty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were afraid we\u2019d melt the frosting if we lit that many candles, Gran.\u201d Alexie grinned, mischief on her face. \u201cSo we settled on one candle for each decade.\u201d</p><p>Chloe set the cake plate on the table and pulled out the book of matches, lighting the candles with a flourish.</p><p>\u201cAn excellent solution.\u201d Winifred leaned forward, drew in a deep breath and blew out the candles while her granddaughters clapped and cheered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll cut the cake while Alexie scoops.\u201d Chloe slid cake onto a plate before passing it to her sister to add ice cream.</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear.\u201d Winifred\u2019s white hair was cut short in a natural cap of snowy curls that framed her face. Her tailored long-sleeved silk blouse had mother-of-pearl buttons from waistline to neck, the emerald silk making her eyes glow a deeper green. She wore a treasured heirloom cameo pin at her throat, a gift from her husband when he\u2019d returned from London more than fifty years earlier. At five foot six, her posture was still nearly perfect, her carriage erect, her walk graceful. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you two could be here tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tradition, Gran. What would a birthday be without a gathering of The Abbott Women?\u201d Chloe adored her grandmother. Winifred Abbott was a force to be reckoned with, both inside and outside their tight-knit family circle. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll do this again when Mom and Lily get home in a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo birthday parties?\u201d Winifred\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cHmm, maybe we should do two every year.\u201d She ran a loving hand over the glossy surface of the rosewood clock sitting on the table next to her. \u201cEspecially if it means I get another present as nice as this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Mom and Lily,\u201d Chloe said promptly.</p><p>\u201cI was telling Chloe earlier that I read the Tribune article about the rehab equipment, Gran,\u201d Alexie commented. \u201cThe reporter did a good job.\u201d</p><p>Chloe flicked a threatening glance at her sister. Alexie caught the look and mouthed \u201cWhat?\u201d Chloe turned to her cake again and kept her head down.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Alexie,\u201d Winifred said. \u201cI hope the publicity generates more donations for the medical center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the reporter planned to interview only the soldier, you and Chloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was her original plan, but Mr. Morrissey happened to be in the ward when we arrived, and since he once served with Dan West, she added him to the mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe owns a company called Morrissey Demolition?\u201d Alexie asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I believe they do a variety of work,\u201d Winifred replied. \u201cBut he apparently specializes in imploding large buildings. He\u2019s in Las Vegas blowing up a casino-hotel this week, isn\u2019t that correct, Chloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear him mention where he\u2019s currently working, Gran.\u201d But if he\u2019s out of town, maybe that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t call. Although there were certainly telephones in Las Vegas.</p><p>\u201cHe must\u2019ve told me about Las Vegas while you were getting ice water for young Dan. He said he\u2019s been working there for several weeks and flew home to Seattle to attend a meeting but had to return to Nevada that evening. I\u2019m sure he said it was a casino he was blowing up and that he\u2019d be there for at least a few more days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes his wife travel with him?\u201d Alexie asked casually.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t married. He seemed quite taken with Chloe, however.\u201d</p><p>Fully aware that two pairs of eyes immediately focused on her, Chloe shook her head. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t all that interested, Gran. Besides, he\u2019s not really my type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your type?\u201d Alexie pulled the newspaper clipping from her pocket and unfolded it in the center of the table for all to see. \u201cLook at this picture. How could he not be your type? What is it about \u2018tall, dark and handsome\u2019 that doesn\u2019t appeal to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose aren\u2019t the only qualities a woman wants,\u201d Winifred put in mildly.</p><p>\u201cOf course not, Gran,\u201d Alexie said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to imagine that any of the khaki-pants-and-glasses, Woody Allen-wannabe men in Chloe\u2019s life could compete with Jake Morrissey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t date men who look like Woody Allen,\u201d Chloe protested, affronted.</p><p>\u201cThe math professor you brought to Lily\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve party was a nerd,\u201d Alexie said.</p><p>\u201cSam is a very nice man. And I don\u2019t date him, we\u2019re just friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s a nerd.\u201d Alexie stared at her until Chloe gave in.</p><p>\u201cAll right. But he\u2019s a nice nerd. And we\u2019ve never been romantically involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sure bet Nice Nerd Sam would never nibble on your ear and look at you like Jake Morrissey did.\u201d Alexie seemed to feel she\u2019d had the last word, jabbing her fork at the clipping for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cI remember when my Richard looked at me like that.\u201d Winifred sighed, a reminiscent smile curving her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaking annoyance for interest,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cJust before the reporter snapped that photo, we argued over whether Dan should go to work for him when he\u2019s released from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing Jake thought he should?\u201d Alexie asked. \u201cAnd you thought he shouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I thought he shouldn\u2019t take a job working with explosives.\u201d Chloe frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s already lost a leg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get back to the subject of Jake Morrissey\u2014I can\u2019t believe you found him annoying.\u201d Alexie waved her fork in the general direction of the clipping. \u201cHe\u2019s way too good-looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt he was a very nice young man,\u201d Winifred declared. \u201cI didn\u2019t find him difficult at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he went out of his way to be charming to you, Gran,\u201d Chloe said wryly.</p><p>\u201cHe did have a certain rough-around-the-edges, Humphrey Bogart appeal,\u201d Winifred agreed.</p><p>\u201cFrom Woody Allen to Bogart.\u201d Alexie laughed out loud. \u201cThat\u2019s a quantum leap, Chloe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I buy your analysis, Gran,\u201d Chloe muttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s how he\u2019s looking at you in the photo. It\u2019s that Bogart and Bacall thing,\u201d Alexie declared.</p><p>Much to Chloe\u2019s relief, the conversation shifted to movie actors and actresses in classic pairings, and away from her and Jake Morrissey. The rest of their visit with Winifred passed with much laughter and friendly arguing over whether Bogart and Bacall led the list of top-ten best couples ever.</p><p>Alone in her bedroom later that evening, Winifred sat on the edge of her turned-down bed and picked up Richard\u2019s photo from her nightstand.</p> <p>\u201cRichard, why can\u2019t the girls find a man like you? Where are all the good men?\u201d She smoothed her fingertips over the glass separating her from his smile. \u201cJake Morrissey might be the one for our Chloe. I think she might be more attracted to him than she\u2019s willing to admit.\u201d</p><p>She pressed a kiss to the photo and returned the silver frame to its place on the white crocheted doily decorating the polished mahogany nightstand.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Richard.\u201d</p><p>He parked in the shadow of a large elm, across the street and half a block away from Winifred Abbott\u2019s stately Victorian home. Chloe Abbott had been ridiculously easy to follow from her house in Queen Anne to her grandmother\u2019s. She\u2019d arrived alone, but while she was still unloading parcels from her car, another vehicle pulled in and parked behind her in the driveway. A second woman got out. He heard them laughing and talking before doors slammed and the two of them entered the house. The neighborhood subsided into relative quiet once more.</p><p>He slumped in the driver\u2019s seat and waited until he was sure Chloe was staying put. Then he left, parking some distance away from the house in the opposite direction. Seattle residents vigorously supported Neighborhood Watch and they were also dog-lovers. The last six weeks he\u2019d spent following Morrissey had taught him that residents walking their dogs tended to notice and grow suspicious if he was parked too long in one place.</p> <p>Around ten o\u2019clock, the two women drove away. He followed Chloe\u2019s Volvo back to Queen Anne and watched her enter the tidy Craftsman bungalow.</p><p>Satisfied, he drove home to neatly enter details of the day\u2019s activities and observations in his log book. Reading his afternoon notes, jotted while slumped in the last seat of the top tier in the far-left corner of the lecture hall, brought a resurgence of the outrage he\u2019d felt as he listened to Chloe\u2019s class voice their opinions. What did any of these late-teens and early twenties students know about the tearing pain felt by the family after a soldier died in combat? He was convinced he was the only person in the lecture hall who\u2019d actually experienced the loss of an American soldier and the devastation that accompanied it.</p><p>Only he could write an essay that told the truth. And he would, he decided.</p><p>He printed a note in the margin, the block letters precise, the message brief. Deliver essay to Liberty Hall, Chloe Abbott\u2019s office, one week from today.</p><p>Then he continued transcribing his personal shorthand into sentences on the page.</p><p>Chloe Abbott would make an easy target. She seemed to lead an ordinary life, with set work hours and close family connections.</p> <p>A predictable schedule and rudimentary surveillance requirements. You\u2019re easy prey, Miss Abbott.</p><p>The spacious parking lot surrounding the casino was empty except for Jake, his crew and the building\u2019s owner with his entourage.</p><p>Jake stepped away from the small crowd, turning his head to speak into his earpiece.</p><p>\u201cYou ready over there, Ed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to go, Sarge. Ready whenever you are.\u201d</p><p>Jake nodded, waved a hand at Ed, visible across the expanse of bare pavement, and turned back to the observers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready, Kyle.\u201d He joined the crowd and lifted the protective plastic guard from the black box. \u201cIt\u2019s all yours.\u201d</p><p>Normally Jake enjoyed this moment when he was able to indulge the ten-year-old child within an adult client and let him or her trigger the control to blow up a huge building. But today, he had difficulty concealing his impatience. He was booked on a 7:00 p.m. flight home to Seattle. With luck, by nine-thirty or ten o\u2019clock he\u2019d be back in his apartment.</p> <p>Kyle set off the first round of explosives and the building\u2019s upper stories imploded. Jake listened, counting the subsequent explosions as each charge detonated in sequence, further weakening the structure and allowing it to fold in on itself, collapsing to the ground with slow grace. Clouds of dust rose. Hiding a grin, Jake watched the well-dressed crowd scatter like chickens in a downpour as the wall of dust moved across the parking lot toward them.</p><p>He headed for his rented SUV. All he had left to finish in Vegas was a celebration dinner and drinks with the client and he could go home to Seattle.</p><p>The next day, Jake decided not to call Chloe after all. Instead, he phoned the florist and arranged to have flowers delivered with a note asking her to lunch\u2014today, tomorrow or whenever she was free. He drove to the University of Washington just before noon and parked the Porsche, then he took a last look at the map he\u2019d printed off the UW Web site and started across campus.</p><p>Liberty Hall was easy to find. Built in 1949 and dedicated to World War II veterans, the four-story brick building had majestic Norman arches and a bell tower. It housed faculty offices for the English Department. Jake paused at an information desk to inquire after Professor Abbott\u2019s whereabouts. Then he followed the secretary\u2019s directions down a wide hallway.</p><p>Halfway down the hall, a white nameplate with black lettering marked Chloe\u2019s space. The door, its bottom half glossy dark wood with a wide mail slot and the top section opaque glass, stood slightly ajar. He rapped lightly on the doorjamb.</p><p>\u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the door wide and stepped across the threshold. The small office was neat and tidy, but crowded with a desk, two wooden guest chairs, a bookcase and a corner coatrack. Chloe stood next to the deep window embrasure across the room, where a vase held a lush spring bouquet.</p><p>\u201cYou got my flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. Thank you\u2014they\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>His mouth curved upward in response to the smile that warmed her face and lit her eyes. He\u2019d have to remember she loved flowers, he thought. \u201cAny chance you\u2019re free for lunch? Today would be great, but I\u2019ll come back tomorrow or the next day, if you\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I was planning on eating yogurt and a banana at my desk while I corrected papers. But the world\u2019s best pizza is just across campus.\u201d She walked to the desk, opened a drawer and took out a straw purse, then looked up at him. \u201cDo you like pizza?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d She moved past him, waiting while he followed her and pulled the door closed. Then she locked the door.</p><p>They left the building, dodging students seated on the dozen steps outside the front door. A warm breeze carried the scent of water from Lake Washington, where the University\u2019s rowing team practiced on the rippled lake surface, the white racing sculls skimming over the blue. Pink, white and red azaleas and rhododendrons made brilliant splashes of color against the background of green fir trees and the ivy that climbed brick-and-stone buildings.</p><p>\u201cGran said you\u2019ve been working out of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, in Vegas.\u201d Jake slipped his sunglasses on, shielding his eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s where you got the tan. I knew you couldn\u2019t have been sunning yourself in Seattle, because until last week, most of our days have been rainy.\u201d Amusement tinged her slightly husky voice. Jake glanced at Chloe to find her smiling.</p><p>\u201cThe Pacific Northwest\u2019s version of liquid sunshine,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cExactly. Are you a native Northwesterner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBorn and raised on the Kitsap Peninsula. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was born in Seattle. I\u2019ve lived here all my life, except for a few years while my father taught at UC Berkeley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s a professor, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was\u2014his field of study was mathematics. He passed away when I was six.\u201d Chloe gestured across campus at the math and science buildings. \u201cAbbott Library over there is named after him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re a third-generation UW professor. That makes you a legend here.\u201d</p><p>Chloe laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Her smile became a frown and she slowed, looking over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer immediately, but he saw her shiver as she scanned the students on the sidewalk behind them.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. At least, nothing I can see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had this creepy feeling for the past few days\u2014as if someone\u2019s watching me. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d swear I\u2019m being followed.\u201d</p><p>Jake stopped, drawing her with him off the sidewalk and onto the grass. The flow of pedestrian traffic continued past them, the walkway crowded with noisy students on their way to lunch.</p><p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re being stalked?\u201d He searched her face, read the uneasiness on her features and looked back at the busy sidewalk, studying the crowd for any visible threat.</p><p>It can\u2019t be a coincidence that she feels she\u2019s being followed so soon after meeting me, Jake thought grimly.</p><p>He\u2019d never forgive himself if he\u2019d made Chloe a target for whoever had been following him for the last six weeks.</p><p>Three</p><p>Jake shifted her behind him, concealing her from the crowd with his body while he continued to inspect the busy walkway.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t actually seen anyone following me but I have this...this eerie feeling that I\u2019m being watched.\u201d Chloe\u2019s fingers closed over his forearm and she felt his muscles flex. \u201cI swear the hair rises on the back of my neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen in doubt, trust your gut instinct,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something doesn\u2019t feel right, it probably isn\u2019t. Soldiers learn that lesson the first week in a combat zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had anything like this happen to me before,\u201d Chloe told him. \u201cI\u2019ve read about it, and seen it in movies. But in real life and to me personally? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound more annoyed than scared.\u201d Jake swept one more glance over the surrounding area. \u201cDo you still feel you\u2019re being watched?\u201d</p><p>Chloe paused, assessing, and was relieved when she realized the eerie feeling had disappeared. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cLet\u2019s resume this over lunch.\u201d He took her arm and they left the grass for the sidewalk. He didn\u2019t return to the subject of a possible stalker until they were seated at the restaurant with slices of hot pizza and cold drinks in front of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat about a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked up, her glass of ice water halfway to her lips. \u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had a fight with a boyfriend lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dating anyone at present.\u201d Chloe caught a quick flash of satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat about ex-boyfriends? Any relationships that ended badly? Guys who might be looking for revenge?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDefinitely not a possible scenario.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat leaves us with professional enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work in the English Department at a university,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cNone of my fellow assistant professors are the James Bond type. In fact...\u201d She smiled. \u201cMy sister calls them Woody Allen\u2013wannabes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He raised his eyebrows. \u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d she protested. \u201cThey\u2019re very nice men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he murmured, but didn\u2019t comment further. \u201cSo you have a sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither of them have a reason to follow or threaten you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A swift mental image of Alexie made Chloe laugh.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just pictured Alexie trying to stalk me. She has no patience\u2014she\u2019d last maybe two minutes before she confronted me and told me exactly what she wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I like her.\u201d Jake\u2019s lips curved in a smile. \u201cApparently both you and Alexie inherited some of your grandmother Winifred\u2019s character traits. You said you have two sisters?\u201d</p><p>Chloe nodded. \u201cAlexie is my older sister. Lily is younger than me by five years. And before you ask...\u201d She held up her hand to forestall his next question. \u201cLily\u2019s on a buying trip in Europe for her lingerie boutique. And my mother\u2019s with her, so neither of them could possibly be connected to this. Not that there\u2019s any possibility of that, anyway,\u201d she added. \u201cI have a normal family, Jake. And I live a perfectly average life. I have no idea why someone would want to follow me or who this person might be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you have nothing to worry about,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cHave you talked to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What would I tell them\u2014that I feel someone watching me?\u201d She frowned. \u201cThey\u2019d call in a psychiatrist and have me committed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot necessarily. They get more complaints like yours than you might think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing they file them in the \u2018paranoid\u2019 folder.\u201d Chloe was unconvinced. \u201cI\u2019d rather wait until I have something concrete to tell them before I call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of evidence are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Chloe bit her lip, considering. \u201cSomething beyond an uneasy feeling. If I\u2019d actually seen the person who\u2019s following me, then I\u2019d have something solid for the police to investigate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t noticed anyone unusual or out of the ordinary? No one who made you feel uncomfortable?\u201d</p><p>Chloe instantly thought of the man wearing sunglasses outside David\u2019s shop.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably nothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other afternoon I was in downtown Seattle, picking up a gift for my grandmother\u2019s birthday. I saw a man outside the shop who seemed to be staring at me through the glass. But I may have been imagining it. I turned to speak to David and when I looked back, the man was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you describe him?\u201d</p><p>She called up the image of the man at David\u2019s shop and told Jake the few things she remembered.</p><p>\u201cAny distinctive features?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen the man since then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you still feel as if someone\u2019s following you.\u201d Jake\u2019s words were more a confirmation than a question.</p><p>Chloe stared at him. His face was set in grim lines. Despite the sunshine that poured through the window behind her, Chloe shivered. \u201cYou think I\u2019m being stalked. You believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jake\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone pale as a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Chloe crossed her arms. The short-sleeved, light cotton sweater she wore over her sleeveless summer dress suddenly wasn\u2019t heavy enough to warm her. \u201cTelling you about it has somehow made it more real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you more than you already are, Chloe.\u201d Jake stretched across the table and took her hand, folding it between his palms. The heat from his hands warmed her chilled fingers and reached past the fear to stir the sexual awareness that always simmered just below the surface when he was near. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out who the man is, why he\u2019s following you and what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t know the man I saw through the window. I have no idea who he is or why he\u2019d follow me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst things first. We should tell the police. Even though you don\u2019t have a lot of information, they can at least take a report and establish a file. Who knows?\u201d Jake shrugged. \u201cMaybe something you tell them will fit into a bigger puzzle, since we have no idea what connection you have with this man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a one o\u2019clock lecture, but after that I\u2019m free for the rest of the afternoon. I\u2019ll drive downtown to the Seattle Police Department when I\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a couple of calls. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll send an officer out here to talk with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather meet the officer off campus. I\u2019d like to keep this from my colleagues and students, if possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Jake looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019d better leave if you\u2019re going to make your one o\u2019clock class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that late already?\u201d Chloe checked her own watch, slid out of the booth and grabbed her purse, waiting while Jake paid their bill.</p><p>He took her arm as they left the restaurant, surveying the student and faculty pedestrians as they crossed the campus.</p><p>\u201cAs first dates go, this has been memorable,\u201d he said when they reached her office at Liberty Hall. He leaned against the doorjamb, waiting for her.</p><p>Chloe slipped her lecture notes and two volumes of poetry into her briefcase and rejoined him. \u201cAre you telling me most women you take out for pizza don\u2019t require bodyguard services?\u201d she asked wryly.</p><p>\u201cNot usually, no.\u201d He looked sideways at her and grinned. Sunlight shafted through the high windows at the end of the hall and burnished his dark hair. Chloe couldn\u2019t help smiling back. She felt safer with him nearby.</p><p>She touched his hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how worried I\u2019ve been. I feel safer just knowing you\u2019re taking me seriously.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened and he covered her hand with his, trapping her fingers against his warm skin. \u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>A door slammed down the hall, the noise breaking the charged moment between them, and Chloe slipped her hand from his. \u201cI\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk with you.\u201d</p><p>Jake fell into step beside her as they left Liberty Hall and walked the short distance to her classroom. She said goodbye and entered the lecture hall on the lower level; Jake followed her, stopping on the threshold to peruse the room. Directly in front of him was a speaker\u2019s table where Chloe was arranging a couple of books and a sheaf of notes. Beyond the small instructor area, theater seats rose in tiers to a set of upper doors where students were entering. The room was filling quickly. Satisfied that Chloe was safe for the moment, Jake stepped outside, lowered the doorstop to keep the door open and moved to the shade of a walnut tree several yards across the lawn. He dropped onto a bench beneath the big old tree and pulled out his cell phone to call his office.</p><p>\u201cMorrissey Demolition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbara, I need you to cancel my afternoon appointments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, boss. Should I reschedule?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell them I\u2019m dealing with an emergency situation and you\u2019ll call tomorrow to arrange another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s fine. I should be in the office late this afternoon. Thanks, Barbara.\u201d He hung up and dialed the cell-phone number for Gray Stewart, an old friend and a detective with the Seattle Police Department. While he waited for Gray to answer, he watched Chloe through the open hall door. She walked back and forth as she spoke, pausing to ask and answer questions, unmistakably passionate about the subject under discussion, whatever it might be.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGray, it\u2019s Jake. I\u2019ve got a problem. I think whoever\u2019s been following me has started stalking a woman I\u2019m seeing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brunette in the Tribune photo?\u201d</p><p>Jake groaned out loud. \u201cHas the entire world seen that picture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably all of Seattle, at least,\u201d Gray said, clearly amused.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell.\u201d He paused. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s the same woman. I just had lunch with her and she told me she\u2019s felt someone watching her, off and on, since a day or so after the picture was in the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe timing\u2019s pretty suspicious. Anything else happen to her? Any threatening letters or a dead rat left on her doorstep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I don\u2019t want her to know about the letter and the blown-apart sewer rat I got. I\u2019d like you to talk to her, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Tell her to come to the station this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather take her myself and meet you somewhere outside your office. She\u2019s teaching a class right now, but we could be there by two-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Meet me at Rosa\u2019s Downtown at two-thirty. And you\u2019re buying my coffee and doughnuts. You still owe me twenty bucks from the last poker game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour, Jake returned messages and caught up on business calls, sitting under the walnut tree. He stood up and waited inside the doorway when Chloe dismissed class. As she collected her books and purse, he assessed the students leaving through the exit at the top of the tiered seats. None of them did anything to rouse his suspicions; they all appeared to be typical college freshmen. Students still crowded the aisle leading to the exit above when Chloe joined him.</p><p>\u201cI called the Seattle P.D. and made arrangements for you to talk to Gray Stewart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he the officer handling harassment reports?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Jake took her briefcase. \u201cGray and I went to high school together. After we graduated, I enlisted in the Marine Corps and he joined the Seattle P.D. He\u2019s a detective now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m parked this way.\u201d He pointed toward the visitors\u2019 lot.</p><p>\u201cMy car\u2019s in the faculty lot in the opposite direction.\u201d Chloe reached for her briefcase. \u201cThanks for all your help, Jake.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you downtown. We\u2019ll come back and pick up your car when you\u2019re finished talking with Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that,\u201d she protested. \u201cI\u2019m sure you must have a dozen ways to spend your afternoon that would be more fun than waiting for me in a police station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, not a thing.\u201d He took her arm and turned her toward the lot where he\u2019d left his car. \u201cBesides, Gray\u2019s meeting us at Rosa\u2019s Downtown, a restaurant near his office. I told him I\u2019d come with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI feel guilty for taking up so much of your day,\u201d Chloe said as she walked beside him toward his car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we can think of a way for you to repay me,\u201d he drawled.</p><p>His voice was blatantly suggestive. Chloe glanced over and caught him watching her.</p><p>\u201cReally? And what might that be?\u201d Her voice was cool.</p> <p>Jake laughed. \u201cNothing gets past you, does it? All I meant was that you can let me take you to dinner. Preferably soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d She was very sure that wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d meant.</p><p>\u201cNot that I won\u2019t be happy to cooperate if you have something friendlier in mind,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know when I do,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou do that. Here we are.\u201d Jake touched the button on his key chain, and the brake lights flashed on a black Porsche.</p> <p>He opened the passenger door and Chloe slid into the seat, fastening her seat belt. He rounded the hood of the car and stowed her briefcase before he got in.</p><p>Chloe ran her hand over the soft leather upholstery and eyed the panel of gauges on the dashboard. \u201cNice car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I like it.\u201d The engine turned over with a throaty growl when he twisted the ignition key. He shifted into gear and backed out of the parking space.</p><p>\u201cDid I mention I drive a Volvo?\u201d she asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked at her and smiled. \u201cBut if you\u2019re wondering how fast I drive, I never race on city streets or the freeway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p> <p>He watched the black Porsche\u2019s taillights blink red when the car slowed at the exit before pulling out into traffic.</p><p>He no longer wondered whether the connection between Morrissey and the lady professor was important. He wasn\u2019t positive just how deep the lady\u2019s feelings went, but he\u2019d observed Jake Morrissey with other women. This one was different.</p><p>Excellent.</p><p>It was time to set in motion the next phase of his plan. Just as Morrissey had been responsible for the death of his son, so would he be responsible for the death of Chloe Abbott. Morrissey Demolition\u2019s current job site was located southeast of downtown Seattle in a rural area. The small building holding Jake\u2019s powder magazine was padlocked and enclosed inside chain-link fencing, along with the huge earth-moving equipment used by the highway contractor.</p><p>He knew exactly how to bypass the alarm, enter the building and get to the powder magazine that held the company\u2019s supply of dynamite. All the equipment required was a small bolt cutter and wire cutters. He didn\u2019t need to steal more than one stick of dynamite and a detonator cap for the justice and revenge he craved.</p><p>He smiled, imagining Chloe Abbott and Liberty Hall\u2019s bell tower blowing sky-high.</p><p>It was almost too easy.</p><p>Four</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Gray.\u201d Jake pointed at a booth near the back of the restaurant. He dropped his hand to her waist to gently urge Chloe ahead of him and they made their way to the rear of the room.</p><p>The man who rose to meet them was as tall as Jake, but his build and coloring were the opposite. With tawny hair and brown eyes, Gray was lean where Jake was burly. Jake introduced Chloe and she slid into the booth, studying the two men while they talked.</p><p>\u201cI ordered coffee for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doughnuts?\u201d Jake said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but since you\u2019re buying, I\u2019m thinking of ordering an eight-course meal for four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late for lunch and too early for dinner,\u201d Jake pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask for a doggie bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>The waitress interrupted them, pouring coffee into their cups.</p><p>\u201cSo, Chloe.\u201d Gray shifted his focus when she\u2019d left. \u201cJake tells me you\u2019re having a problem with someone following you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t exactly had a problem yet. It\u2019s more like I\u2019m afraid I might have a problem. So far, I\u2019ve had the uneasy feeling that someone\u2019s watching me, sometimes following me, but that\u2019s all.\u201d She tore open a packet and stirred sugar into her coffee, looking up in time to catch a swift exchange of glances between Gray and Jake.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re being followed, someone has a reason. Have you had any disagreements with students that got out of hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cOne of my freshman composition classes had a debate about the military after the Tribune story appeared, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of debate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the students argued that international peacekeeping wasn\u2019t worth the loss of American solders\u2019 legs or lives. Others believed the cost to our country and our soldiers was necessary to help maintain peace around the world.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDid any of the students argue directly with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I tried to stay neutral. The discussion grew heated, but I don\u2019t remember any student who was angry with me specifically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him about the man outside the shop window,\u201d Jake prompted.</p><p>Chloe repeated what she\u2019d told Jake earlier.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what he looked like?\u201d Gray asked, taking a pen and notebook from his pocket and flipping it open.</p><p>\u201cAverage height, weight, black hair. There really wasn\u2019t anything distinctive about him. He wore a baseball hat pulled down over his eyes and dark sunglasses, so I couldn\u2019t see much of his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember how he was dressed\u2014jacket, shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Chloe related the details she could recall.</p><p>\u201cWhen you saw him, did you have the same uneasy feeling that you said you felt today on campus?\u201d</p><p>Chloe\u2019s eyes widened as she considered the question. \u201cYes, it was exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you have seen the man who\u2019s stalking you.\u201d Gray looked at his notes, then back at Chloe. \u201cHave you received any threatening phone calls or letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. Trust me, I\u2019d remember if I\u2019d received anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d Gray closed his notebook and sat back, eyeing the two of them across the table. \u201cUnfortunately, until whoever\u2019s stalking you actually does something, there\u2019s nothing I can do except take your information and file a report.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of that,\u201d Chloe said, glancing at Jake. His face was grim and a muscle flexed along his jawline.</p><p>\u201cThere must be some way we can flush this guy out,\u201d Jake muttered.</p><p>\u201cThe department\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t provide for enough manpower to have Chloe followed,\u201d Gray said. He nodded thoughtfully. \u201cBut unofficially, maybe...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jake demanded.</p><p>Gray reached into his inner coat pocket and pulled out a narrow envelope, tapping it against the table. \u201cMy aunt gave me her two tickets for the Seattle symphony tomorrow night at Benaroya Hall. If Chloe\u2019s willing to go with you, I\u2019ll follow you. If we\u2019re lucky, our stalker will be so busy watching you he won\u2019t notice me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d Jake scowled. \u201cIt puts Chloe in a potentially dangerous situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if this person has actually threatened me, Jake,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, he hasn\u2019t really done anything except watch me. It\u2019s creepy, granted, but it\u2019s possible he\u2019s someone from campus with a crush on me, maybe a student from one of my classes. And if we confront him, it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll stop. Don\u2019t you think that makes sense, Gray?\u201d</p><p>The two men exchanged an unreadable look.</p><p>\u201cBenaroya Hall is a public place, Jake. It\u2019s not likely he\u2019ll try anything in a crowd that big,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThe head of security at the hall is an ex-Seattle PD captain. He can move people around and get me a seat above you so I can search the crowd for anyone who might be watching you instead of the stage. And you\u2019ll be with Chloe the entire time, which means he won\u2019t have a chance to get near her while she\u2019s alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we guarantee her safety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anything in life is a hundred-percent certain, but the odds are in our favor. And,\u201d Gray added, \u201cit\u2019s our best chance to catch him, or at least get a visual and possible ID. As it stands, we don\u2019t have anything solid to work with here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Jake said reluctantly. \u201cI\u2019m not crazy about the idea but it sounds like all we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d Gray lifted his coffee cup and silently toasted them. \u201cHere\u2019s to catching the SOB, whoever he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from that nice Mr. Morrissey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Gran, I did. In fact, I had lunch with Jake yesterday and he\u2019s taking me to the symphony tonight.\u201d</p><p>Winifred restrained a crow of approval. Good work, Jake. She spoke calmly despite her excitement. \u201cHow nice, dear. The symphony is always a pleasant evening\u2019s entertainment. Benaroya Hall is one of my favorite places. The acoustics are wonderful. What composer is scheduled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, Gran, the program tonight is pop music, mostly Broadway show tunes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Winifred\u2019s respect for Jake went up a notch. \u201cI must say I\u2019m impressed with your young man\u2019s fortitude.\u201d</p><p>Chloe laughed. \u201cSo am I, Gran. Remember how Grandad grumbled when you and Mom made him take you to a pop music concert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Your grandfather really disliked pop music. He was a staunch Beethoven and Tchaikovsky man, all the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d Chloe\u2019s voice was filled with warmth. \u201cI\u2019d better scoot, Gran, I have to get ready for my date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun,\u201d Winifred said before she hung up the phone. She looked at the photo of her late husband, framed in crystal and sitting on the kitchen windowsill, next to the phone. \u201cRichard,\u201d she said softly, smiling with delight. \u201cThe situation between Chloe and Jake is proceeding even better than I\u2019d hoped.\u201d</p><p>Chloe switched off the portable phone and dropped it on the bed. It landed next to the lacy, pale-green underwear laid out on the spread. A backless emerald sheath with matching silk shawl hung on a padded hanger hooked over the open closet door.</p><p>She walked into the bathroom, stripped off her clothes and tossed them in the hamper before stepping into the shower. With quick efficiency, she shampooed, soaped and rinsed, then left the glass stall to towel off and smooth body lotion over still-damp skin. Drying her hair took only moments. It occurred to her as she began to apply makeup that she wouldn\u2019t be anticipating the evening quite this happily if Jake wasn\u2019t her date.</p><p>Okay, so it\u2019s not just love of music that has me excited, she thought.</p><p>She paused, eye shadow brush in hand, and examined her reflection in the mirror. Excited. Yes, she was definitely excited. Jake intrigued her. He made her aware of him as no other man ever had. And he made her want him.</p><p>Despite the brief time she\u2019d known Jake, there was something about him that made her heart shriek \u201cmine\u201d whenever she saw him. Her rational mind had no control over the gut-level reaction. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maybe it was because of the unusual circumstances caused by the possibility of danger from an unknown stalker. Perhaps she was instinctively drawn to Jake\u2019s protectiveness.</p><p>Or not. She could be totally off base. She had a degree in English literature, not psychology.</p><p>I hope Gray catches this man tonight, whoever he is. I never thought I\u2019d say this, but a normal, ordinary, sometimes boring life is beginning to sound better and better.</p><p>She finished dressing and went downstairs, shawl and small evening purse in hand. Reaching the foot of the stairs and the slate-floored entryway, she glanced into the living room at the mantel clock just as the doorbell rang. She peered through the side window, verified that the man on her porch was Jake and opened the door.</p> <p>\u201cHello.\u201d My, oh, my. From the top of his well-combed hair to the tips of his polished black shoes\u2014and the black Ralph Lauren suit that clothed the toned, muscled body between\u2014Jake was gorgeous. If Alexie could only see you, she\u2019d never tease me about my male friends again.</p><p>His gaze swept swiftly downward before returning slowly, lingering, making heat bloom under her skin. She shivered as if he\u2019d trailed his fingertips over her.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said softly. \u201cReady to go?\u201d He held out his hand, took the shawl from her unresisting fingers, and Chloe suddenly realized that she was standing perfectly still, simply staring at him. Jake\u2019s expression was blatantly hungry; she wondered if hers held the same open need.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer and slipped the shawl around her shoulders, then tugged gently. She obeyed the slight pressure, joining him on the porch. He bent his head until his lips touched her ear. \u201cIn case someone\u2019s watching...\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>Chloe\u2019s gaze met his for a brief moment before she tilted her head in silent invitation. The bright blue of his eyes darkened to indigo, and he brushed his lips against hers once, twice, before his mouth settled over hers.</p><p>The world narrowed to his mouth on hers. Chloe\u2019s knees weakened. Her fingers clutched his sleeve and she leaned into him, his chest and the hard muscles of his thighs supporting her.</p><p>When he lifted his head, he left her craving more. She opened her eyes and tightened her grip on his jacket sleeve to keep him from leaving her\u2014until she realized they were standing on her front porch, in full view of her neighbors and anyone passing by.</p><p>And that\u2019s the point, she remembered belatedly. We\u2019re hoping someone is watching.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d His voice was rougher than usual. He took her hand and led her down the steps, tucking her into the passenger seat of the Porsche.</p><p>Chloe checked the side mirror several times as they neared downtown Seattle. \u201cI don\u2019t see Gray, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe picked us up two blocks from your house.\u201d</p><p>She searched the mirror again but didn\u2019t see a car following them. Traffic was moderately heavy, and all around them cars, trucks and SUVs switched lanes, turned off the street or sped up to pass Jake\u2019s Porsche. None of the vehicles appeared to remain steadily behind them. \u201cI can\u2019t find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jake flashed a grin. \u201cThen he\u2019s doing his job.\u201d He flicked a glance in the mirror. \u201cHe\u2019s about six cars behind us, opposite lane. He\u2019s off duty so he\u2019s driving his own car, a gray SUV.\u201d</p><p>Chloe looked over her shoulder, counted back six cars and found Gray. \u201cClever. He\u2019s very good at this, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s a detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope he knows how much I appreciate that he\u2019s giving up his off-duty time to help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>Jake slowed, merging with the line of cars waiting to turn into the Second Avenue entrance to the underground parking lot. It was fifteen minutes before they found a space and left the Porsche.</p> <p>Chloe draped the shawl around her shoulders and took Jake\u2019s arm. \u201cIs Gray parked here, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne aisle over. The only time we\u2019ll be out of his sight is when we take the elevator upstairs to the Boeing Company Gallery. But we\u2019ll have lots of other people around us.\u201d Jake nodded at the well-dressed couples streaming toward the bank of elevators. \u201cEven if our man is here, the crowd will provide a buffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Chloe\u2019s fingers tightened unconsciously on his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d She looked up to find him watching her. Confidence and strength sat easily on his shoulders and the butterflies in her stomach instantly quieted. She drew a long breath. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Lead on, Macduff.\u201d</p><p>Jake laughed. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>They rode the elevator up to the gallery and joined the chatting, laughing crowd as it moved on to the Grand Lobby. The curved bank of windows that separated the lobby from the city skyline allowed late-evening sunshine to fall across the plush carpet. Sconces were already lit inside the vast, elegant room, their light glittering on ladies\u2019 jewels and highlighting the bright colors of their dresses.</p><p>Jake pushed back his cuff and looked at his watch. \u201cWe have another fifteen minutes. Would you like a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d just as soon find our seats, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Jake covered her hand with his where it rested on his arm, pressing it closer in reassurance, before he released her to get their tickets from his coat pocket.</p><p>The usher led them down a hallway and then through a door and held open a curtain for them.</p><p>\u201cBox seats?\u201d Chloe smiled with delight. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me Gray\u2019s aunt had season box seats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Jake shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s why Gray thought this would work. He\u2019s two boxes over and one level up. He can see almost the entire auditorium from there and he\u2019ll watch the audience with binoculars. Anyone whose eyes are on us instead of the stage will stand out like a sore thumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the man\u2019s actually in the audience,\u201d Chloe said.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jake agreed. \u201cAnd if he isn\u2019t, maybe he\u2019ll follow us home and Gray will spot him then. And if not,\u201d he continued, picking up her hand and threading her fingers through his, \u201cwe\u2019ve spent a nice evening at the symphony. No hardship, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cDefinitely not a hardship.\u201d</p><p>Four hours later, Jake pulled the Porsche into Chloe\u2019s driveway and turned off the engine. Chloe reached for the door handle.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe nothing.\u201d</p><p>In the street behind them, a plain blue sedan drew near. The car didn\u2019t slow down, didn\u2019t speed up. It did nothing to arouse suspicion as it drove past them, the sole occupant never even glancing their way. A moment later, Gray\u2019s SUV passed by.</p><p>\u201cThat was Gray. Do you think he\u2019s following the other car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I do.\u201d Jake pushed open the driver\u2019s door and got out, coming around to open Chloe\u2019s. He bent toward her and murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t look down the street after Gray. Pretend we\u2019re just a couple returning from an evening out.\u201d She nodded and he took her hand, drawing her from the car, and they walked up the sidewalk to the porch, climbing the steps to her front entry.</p><p>Chloe unlocked the door and went inside. Jake followed her, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t turn on the lights.\u201d He moved swiftly to the narrow side window and shifted the curtain a scant inch to look outside.</p><p>Chloe stood in the center of the tiled entryway, her shawl clutched to her chest, barely breathing as the minutes ticked by. The sound of her heartbeat thudded in her ears.</p><p>Jake\u2019s cell phone rang.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d He was silent, glancing at Chloe. \u201cThanks, Gray.\u201d He switched off the phone and slipped it into his jacket pocket. \u201cGray thinks the man in the blue car was following us, but he lost him. Whoever was driving the car abandoned it three blocks from here and disappeared. He probably had another car parked near the site and was gone before Gray got there. Gray wasn\u2019t close enough to get a visual of the driver.\u201d</p><p>Chloe\u2019s heart sank. \u201cSo we still don\u2019t have any information about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give up hope. Gray ran the plate numbers on the car and they belong to a pickup truck in Bellevue. I\u2019m guessing both the plates and the car were stolen earlier tonight in separate thefts. Our stalker\u2019s careful and he\u2019s smart. I\u2019m going to help Gray go over the car.\u201d Jake wrapped his arms around Chloe. \u201cAre you okay staying here by yourself?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Jake dropped a hard kiss on her lips and released her, pulling open the door. \u201cLock this after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Chloe waited until he\u2019d stepped onto the porch and shut the door, then she slid the dead bolt home and twisted the lock. Peering through a gap in the curtains, she watched him back the Porsche out of her drive, taillights winking red as he disappeared down the block.</p><p>Unable to settle down, she poured a giant mug of milk, added three tablespoons of chocolate syrup and popped it into the microwave. While she waited for it to heat, Chloe leaned on the counter, gazing out the window over her sink into the backyard. A full moon rode high in the sky, turning the familiar shapes of lilac tree, rhododendrons, wisteria, apple tree and tall blue spruce into shadowy, mysterious forms.</p><p>This was her world, and for the first time, she felt a niggle of fear as she contemplated what might be in her moon-dappled garden besides flowers and trees.</p><p>Five</p><p>Stealing the stick of dynamite and blasting cap from Morrissey Demolition hadn\u2019t been difficult at all.</p><p>Morrissey\u2019s work site in Black Diamond, southeast of Seattle, had an equipment shack in a large area enclosed within chain-link fencing. The locked-off area held parked bulldozers, backhoes, massive concrete-and-metal culverts and other equipment owned by Warren Construction, the Washington State contractor responsible for building a twenty-mile section of road. The contractor had a security service that patrolled the area once every hour to protect the expensive equipment and supplies stored inside the fence.</p><p>He had no interest in any of that. He only cared about Morrissey\u2019s dynamite.</p><p>The small bolt cutters snipped through the chain links of the fence and made short work of the padlock securing the Morrissey storage shed. Once he was inside, it was a matter of minutes to locate the powder magazine, cut the bolts holding the double-hooded locks that secured it, slice through the locks and open the steel box. The magazine\u2019s interior was lined with wood to ensure no accidental spark from exposed metal could threaten the stability of the explosives. He found just a handful of dynamite sticks but he didn\u2019t care. He needed only one.</p><p>He removed the eight-inch-long brown stick and placed it in a narrow wooden box, then stowed the box in his jacket pocket. Carefully closing the powder magazine, he rearranged the locks so a casual observer would see nothing amiss.</p><p>The detonator caps were stored in a second locked box. He cut through the locks, removed a cap with its attached wires and tucked it into the small tote he\u2019d carried in with him. When he\u2019d closed the box, he rearranged the locks, then picked up the black tote bag and his bolt cutters, and checked his watch. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled. His timing was perfect. The security guard wasn\u2019t due for another twenty minutes. He eased the shed door open and peered out. The bright moonlight was the only flaw in his plan. Fortunately, the huge pieces of earthmoving equipment and stacks of supplies threw giant shadows over the exposed spaces between him and safety.</p><p>He crept out of the shack and hung the sliced padlock back on the hasp. Its appearance wouldn\u2019t withstand close scrutiny, but in the dark, it would suffice.</p><p>He stood very still, scanning the area. Nothing moved. Satisfied, he ran toward the fence, moving quickly from shadow to shadow. He slipped through the fence, taking time to bend the wire into place again.</p><p>With a last backward glance, he melted into the brush and trees. Ten minutes later, he was driving northwest. Within the hour, he\u2019d reached his apartment in Seattle\u2019s Capitol Hill district and was hidden once more.</p> <p>He wondered which one of Morrissey\u2019s crew had followed him from Chloe Abbott\u2019s house earlier. Stealing license plates and pairing them with nondescript stolen cars was a strategy he\u2019d used often while tailing Morrissey over the past six weeks. Tonight his caution had paid off.</p><p>He opened his journal and began to write, satisfaction buoying him.</p><p>Morrissey didn\u2019t have enough hours left to stop the sequence of events that was about to destroy him.</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p> <p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Sent: May 22</p><p>Subject: Good morning\u2014</p><p>Dear Clara,</p><p>I have interesting news to share! I spoke with Chloe last night and learned she\u2019d had lunch with Jake Morrissey yesterday. And he took her to the symphony last night. (Picture me gleefully dancing a jig in my living room.:-)</p> <p>I really like this young man and it appears Chloe might, too. Wouldn\u2019t it be lovely if all three of our granddaughters were planning weddings??!! Stay tuned for further developments.</p><p>Helen telephoned yesterday to discuss the final details for our trip to British Columbia to celebrate my birthday. She wants to tour Victoria in a horse-drawn carriage after high tea at the Empress Hotel. I voted \u201cyes\u201d on that suggestion, of course, and we both want to browse the shops for tins of good English tea. I\u2019d like to find a new Scottish wool blanket, also, just a small one to cover my lap while I\u2019m reading on rainy winter days. Is there anything special we can pick up for you, Clara? I wish you were going with us\u2014it just won\u2019t be the same without you there. But next year, the three of us will spend my birthday somewhere equally fun.</p><p>I\u2019d better get busy. I\u2019ll let you know the moment I hear from Chloe about her date with Jake.</p><p>All my love,</p><p>Winifred</p><p>Chloe carried a large glass of ice water and the stack of essays onto her back deck and set them on the glass table in the shade of the patio umbrella. She dropped into a wrought-iron chair. Stretching out her legs, she crossed her ankles and sighed with pleasure. The late-afternoon sun slanted across the gray-painted wood deck, warming her bare legs. The umbrella\u2019s shade blocked the sunshine from her upper body. Still, the heat and bright sky were a welcome change from the showers and gray days of two weeks earlier.</p><p>Only in Seattle do you need a wool sweater under your raincoat one week, and two weeks later, you can sit in the sun wearing shorts with a tank top, she thought. Gotta love this city.</p><p>She straightened her arms over her head and arched her back, stretching luxuriously. Then she pulled the stack of essays closer, picked up the top one and began to read. Red pencil in hand, she worked her way through half the pile before taking a break.</p> <p>Jake had called earlier to fill her in on developments since last night. They hadn\u2019t found any identifying information or fingerprints in the abandoned sedan. The truck owner had reported his license plates stolen this morning and had no idea why they were on a sedan. Gray was running the VIN number in an attempt to trace the car, but he expected that the sedan had been stolen, too.</p><p>Jake also mentioned that he\u2019d spent most of the day at his company\u2019s current work site in Black Diamond. During the night, someone had broken into the Morrissey Demolition storage shed and stolen dynamite. The foreman of the road construction crew swore nothing was missing from his list of equipment and supplies, so it appeared the thief had targeted only the explosives.</p><p>Jake sounded frustrated with the dead ends and delays, and she was just as disappointed as he was when he had to cancel their dinner plans. She\u2019d settled for a mixed salad with slices of barbecued chicken, eaten on her patio in the sunshine.</p><p>Taking a water bottle with her, Chloe returned to the deck and sank into her chair again. It was now almost eight o\u2019clock. She picked up the next essay, but two paragraphs in, she frowned and sat up straighter. Each paragraph had a group of letters\u2014gibberish\u2014enclosed in parentheses.</p><p>She flipped to the cover sheet to check the writer\u2019s name, and to her surprise, there wasn\u2019t one. The other necessary elements were present\u2014class title and number, professor\u2019s name, date, the title of the essay: \u201cThe American Military: Friend or Enemy?\u201d</p><p>Even more puzzled, she went through the stack of essays on the table, then her list of students enrolled in the class. There were five fewer essays than students, but three of them had already contacted her and been given permission to deliver their work late. One of those students had broken his arm in a pickup game of football; one\u2019s National Guard unit had been activated and she was training in Yakima; the third was at a funeral in Tucson. The remaining two students had distinctive writing styles and she felt sure she could rule them out.</p><p>If none of the students registered in her class had written this essay, then who had? Chloe knew anyone could have dropped the paper through the mail slot in her door; students delivered work that way all the time. She didn\u2019t remember finding this particular document on her office floor and filing it with the other essays, but it was more than likely she\u2019d done so without giving it a thought. Still, why would anyone have gone to such lengths\u2014writing and delivering a paper for a class in which he or she wasn\u2019t even registered?</p><p>She picked up the mysterious essay to resume reading where she\u2019d left off, and by the time she\u2019d finished, her inner alarms were shrieking. There was something decidedly off-kilter about the essay. Not only were all the paragraphs interspersed with parentheses enclosing collections of letters that she couldn\u2019t understand, but the author made angry, disparaging remarks about the military in general and the Marine Corps in particular. Something about the gibberish in the parentheses felt vaguely familiar, but she couldn\u2019t seem to grasp why.</p><p>The essay ended with a paragraph alleging government collusion to conceal the truth about the death of marines in combat situations abroad. Thee was a specific reference to military personnel dying in Afghanistan.</p><p>Chloe stared at the typed pages, trying to see a pattern that might reveal a hidden message or a clue that might tell her the identity of the writer. Unfortunately, she found nothing that made sense.</p><p>Gran could probably take one look at this and know if the writer had hidden a message in the words.</p><p>She pushed back her chair decisively, gathered up the papers and hurried into the house. She dropped the stack of essays on the table and ran upstairs to collect a light sweater. She grabbed her purse, slipping her feet into leather sandals, and after checking to make sure all the locks in the house were secure, drove to Winifred\u2019s.</p><p>Chloe mulled over the style and the content of the essay tucked into her purse. However, she was no closer to deciphering the puzzle when she reached her grandmother\u2019s home.</p><p>Winifred answered her knock almost immediately and smiled with pleasure. \u201cWhy, Chloe, come in, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Gran.\u201d Chloe stepped past Winifred and into the entryway, turning to look at her grandmother. \u201cSorry to come by so late, but I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Winifred\u2019s gaze sharpened and frown lines appeared between her brows. \u201cJoin me in the kitchen. I was going to have a glass of iced tea. You can tell me all about it.\u201d</p><p>Chloe followed Winifred down the hall to the big kitchen, sitting down in a chair at the oak table by the big window. The table already held a crystal pitcher, a Wedgewood plate with several cookies and a tall glass. Winifred took another glass and spoon from the cupboard and sat across from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pour,\u201d Winifred said as she picked up the pitcher. \u201cWhile you tell me what has you so worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this essay, Gran.\u201d Chloe removed the three-page document from her purse and laid it on the table between them. \u201cWhoever wrote it clearly has issues with the American military, particularly the Marines, but there are also weird words, gibberish really, spaced throughout. I can\u2019t make any sense of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever wrote it? What do you mean? Isn\u2019t the writer one of your students?\u201d She finished pouring the iced tea, set a glass in front of Chloe and stirred sugar into her own.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another odd thing.\u201d Chloe slid the stapled papers closer to her grandmother and pointed at the top sheet. \u201cThe writer didn\u2019t sign his or her name. It\u2019s anonymous.\u201d</p><p>Winifred raised her eyebrows, bending forward to read the cover page. \u201cWell, that certainly is odd. How does he expect to get credit for his work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he does. I don\u2019t think the writer is one of my students.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why would he turn in the essay?\u201d Winifred asked slowly, setting aside glass and spoon to pick up the papers.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Chloe said. \u201cI\u2019m sure this essay was with a group of several others that students dropped through the slot in my office door. There\u2019s something about the gibberish that nags at me. I feel as if I should know what it means, but I don\u2019t. It\u2019s just letters strung together. I\u2019m hoping you can give me some insight.\u201d</p><p>Winifred began to read. Chloe sipped her tea, nibbled on a Hob Nob cookie and waited impatiently for her to finish.</p><p>Finally, Winifred reached the last page and looked up.</p><p>\u201cWell? What do you think it means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I agree with you. There\u2019s something familiar about the letters in parentheses,\u201d Winifred said thoughtfully. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re merely random.\u201d She paused, a faraway look in her eyes, her fingers drumming on the table. \u201cOf course.\u201d She pushed back her chair.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Winifred hurried out of the room. Chloe heard her footsteps as she moved quickly down the hall, and guessed she\u2019d gone to her office off the living room. Moments later Winifred reappeared, carrying a thick hardcover book, a pad of paper and a pen.</p><p>She sat down, handed Chloe the pen and notepaper, and opened the book to the index.</p><p>Chloe turned her head, twisting to read the title of the book. Codebreakers Through History. She straightened in her chair. \u201cGran, do you see a pattern? Do you think the letters are a code?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might be....\u201d</p><p>Chloe pulled the essay closer and looked at the first grouping of letters enclosed in parentheses. \u201cYildoc,\u201d she read out loud. \u201cYou think that\u2019s a word?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt might be. Ah, here it is.\u201d Winifred leafed through the book, stopping to scan a page before turning to the next. \u201cYes,\u201d she said with satisfaction. \u201cI need you to spell out the letters for me, then write down what I tell you, Chloe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. The first one is Y-I-L-D-O-C.\u201d</p><p>Winifred ran her fingertip down a list. \u201cJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letter J?\u201d Chloe asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes. What\u2019s the next set of letters within parentheses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-S-E-N-I-L.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an A.\u201d She waited for Chloe to jot down the letter and find the next parenthetical set of letters.</p><p>\u201cJ-A-D-H-O-L-N-I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a K. Next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA-H-N-A-H.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an E. Next.\u201d</p><p>Chloe stared at the letters she\u2019d written down. \u201cGran.\u201d</p><p>Winifred looked up. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just spelled Jake.\u201d</p><p>Winifred nodded abruptly. \u201cThen I was right. Whoever wrote the essay used the World War II code based on the Navajo language.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying a Navajo wrote the essay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. The code was never broken during the war and was kept top secret. It wasn\u2019t officially recognized by the Pentagon until 1992. But since then, there have been articles written about the Navajo codebreakers and how the code worked. I believe Hollywood even made a movie called Windtalkers about the use of the Navajo code during the war in the Pacific. Public knowledge about the subject has definitely increased over the past several years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo anyone who wanted to could look up the code and learn how to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically speaking, yes. I\u2019m sure the details are available on the Internet somewhere, since most things are these days. Using the code orally would be almost impossible for anyone except a Navajo because the language itself is extremely complex. It\u2019s almost unintelligible to anyone except a native. But to write it\u2014\u201d Winifred tapped the essay in front of Chloe \u201c\u2014that\u2019s quite easy, really. All you\u2019d have to do is look up the English letters of the alphabet and the Navajo words assigned to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these don\u2019t look like words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Whoever wrote them neglected to hyphenate them where needed. For instance, \u2018yildoc\u2019 is really Yil-Doc, and \u2018jadholni\u2019 is Jad-Ho-Loni. Nonetheless, it\u2019s clear to me that the Navajo code is the basis for the words enclosed in parentheses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the first word is Jake. Why would someone encode his name in an essay given to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the real mystery, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Winifred\u2019s expression was solemn. \u201cLet\u2019s finish going through the letters in parentheses and see what words we have when we\u2019re done.\u201d</p> <p>Several moments later, Chloe and Winifred stared at the three names.</p><p>\u201cJake Morrissey, Chloe Abbott and Kenny Dodd,\u201d Winifred read slowly. \u201cWhy is your name here, Chloe? And who is Kenny Dodd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Gran, but I\u2019m going to find out.\u201d Chloe took her cell phone from her purse and dialed Jake\u2019s number.</p><p>Six</p><p>When Jake received Chloe\u2019s call, Gray was at his apartment. They arrived at Winifred\u2019s house together, Jake\u2019s Porsche closely followed by Gray\u2019s SUV as they pulled into the circular driveway.</p><p>Chloe met them at the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jake demanded, his gaze running over her, searching for signs of damage.</p><p>\u201cCome into the kitchen. Gran can help me explain.\u201d She said hello to Gray, standing behind Jake. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Gray. You need to hear this, too.\u201d</p><p>She led them down the hall to the kitchen and introduced Gray to Winifred.</p><p>\u201cSit down, gentlemen.\u201d Winifred gestured at two empty chairs and looked at Chloe. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you start, Chloe.\u201d</p><p>Chloe nodded and, as succinctly as possible, told them about the essay and the encoded words.</p><p>Gray turned to Jake. \u201cWho\u2019s Kenny Dodd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a kid who died in Afghanistan.\u201d Jake\u2019s face was grim. \u201cHe was in the wrong place at the wrong time when I detonated a charge I\u2019d set to take out a bridge.\u201d</p><p>Chloe\u2019s heart cramped at the expression of stark pain that flashed across his features. He feels responsible for that young soldier\u2019s death.</p><p>Gray whistled softly. \u201cSo the stalker is connected to the military, not to your demolition work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jake said. \u201cI guess so. We\u2019ve been looking in the wrong place, at the wrong people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder we didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d Chloe lifted her hand. \u201cWhat are you saying? You\u2019ve \u2018been looking.\u2019 Is this my stalker or your stalker?\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes were unreadable, but they met hers without flinching. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the person following you may really be after me.\u201d</p><p>Chloe could only stare at him, speechless, as scenes from the last few days ran through her mind\u2014the man outside David\u2019s shop window, the eerie feeling that someone was following her on campus, the blue sedan driving by her house after the symphony. The man was stalking her because she\u2019d met Jake?</p><p>\u201cGray and I suspected that might be the case. You told me the feeling that someone was watching you didn\u2019t start until after the photos of us appeared in the Tribune,\u201d Jake continued.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she murmured, frowning.</p><p>\u201cThe photo may have been the catalyst that caused the stalker to link you with me.\u201d</p><p>Chloe thought about the group of photos that had accompanied the article and cold fear gripped her. \u201cMy grandmother was in those pictures, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed any strangers watching you, Mrs. Abbott?\u201d Jake asked. \u201cMaybe a car following you when you leave the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing like that,\u201d Winifred said firmly. \u201cAnd I would have noticed.\u201d She turned to Chloe. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s been going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was probably a student with a crush on me, Gran. It made me nervous because it\u2019s a little creepy, knowing someone might be stalking me, but I wasn\u2019t really afraid for my safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s every reason to believe you shouldn\u2019t be afraid, even now,\u201d Gray put in. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, the primary target appears to be Jake. Someone\u2019s been shadowing him for weeks, and the fact that you\u2019re having the same experience so soon after the photos were made public indicates you\u2019re a secondary interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? Because I won\u2019t leave town if Chloe\u2019s in danger.\u201d Concern shaded Winifred\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cGran\u2019s taking the Queen Victoria cruise ship to Victoria, B.C., in the morning,\u201d Chloe explained, answering Jake\u2019s unspoken question. \u201cIt\u2019s only an overnight trip\u2014a birthday gift from a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t think Chloe\u2019s in real danger, Mrs. Abbott. We believe the man\u2019s after me and he\u2019s only interested in Chloe because he saw her with me in the photo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d Chloe drew a deep breath and covered Winifred\u2019s hand with hers. \u201cI think you should go to Victoria, Gran, and have a great time. Have high tea at the Empress Hotel, visit Butchart Gardens and shop till you drop. With any luck, by the time you get home, Jake and Gray will have found this person and solved the puzzle. And our lives will go back to being quiet, normal and totally boring.\u201d</p><p>Winifred\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cAt my age, Chloe, a little excitement makes life interesting. But I\u2019ll settle for tea at the Empress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Chloe kissed her cheek, relieved that her grandmother would be safely out of town until Jake and Gray had time to apprehend the stalker, whoever he was.</p><p>The three took their leave of Winifred. Jake walked Chloe to her car and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute. I need to talk to Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Chloe slid into the driver\u2019s seat, watching in her rearview mirror as Jake walked back to Gray\u2019s SUV, parked behind his Porsche, which was blocking Chloe.</p><p>The two men spoke for a few minutes, then Gray reversed out of the driveway to park on the street while Jake walked back to her car.</p><p>He leaned down, resting his forearms on the window. \u201cCome home with me, Chloe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Startled, she could only stare at him.</p><p>He swore under his breath. \u201cNot to sleep with me. Not unless you want to,\u201d he amended, his lips curving in a slight grin that swiftly disappeared. \u201cI\u2019d just feel better if you were close enough for me to keep an eye on tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave my home.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you would. So I\u2019ve asked Gray to have one of his off-duty cop friends stand guard outside your house tonight. Calling in a favor,\u201d he added. \u201cSince we still don\u2019t have enough evidence to get the police involved, we\u2019ll continue to handle this unofficially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re that worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m that careful.\u201d</p><p>Chloe\u2019s eyes darted to her grandmother\u2019s house, but before she could speak, Jake reassured her. \u201cGray\u2019s going to stay and watch over Winifred.\u201d He looked over his shoulder. \u201cHe backed out of the driveway to let us leave. He\u2019ll pull back in when we\u2019re gone and park in plain sight. If our stalker plans to bother Winifred, Gray will be waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness.\u201d Relief washed over Chloe. \u201cWill he stay until the limo picks her up in the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jake leaned into the car and pressed a hard kiss against her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll follow you home. By the time we get there, Gray\u2019s friend should have arrived and he\u2019ll park outside your house, just like Gray\u2019s doing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere will you be?\u201d She struggled to speak above a whisper. He\u2019d stolen her breath and sidetracked her ability to think with that kiss.</p><p>\u201cAt my apartment working. I need access to my computer and other files to track down information on Kenny Dodd. Otherwise, I\u2019d be the guard in the car outside your door.\u201d</p><p>Chloe smiled at him, touched. \u201cYou\u2019re such a Galahad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot hardly,\u201d he growled. \u201cAnd if I ever get you alone at my place, I\u2019ll prove it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and he walked back to his car. The engine turned over with a throaty growl and he backed the sports car out of Winifred\u2019s driveway, waiting for her to precede him.</p><p>Chloe glanced out the living room window the following morning. The silver sedan with Gray\u2019s friend behind the steering wheel was still parked in her driveway.</p><p>\u201cBless you, Jake,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cWhat would I do without you and your friends?\u201d</p><p>She walked into the kitchen where the automatic timer had switched on the grind-and-brew coffeemaker fifteen minutes earlier. The welcoming aroma of fresh coffee pervaded the air and she poured a cup, taking a sip before setting it on the counter. When she\u2019d replenished the bird feeder outside, she\u2019d get some coffee for the officer, too. She filled a plastic quart pitcher with birdseed from a large bag in the pantry and opened the door to the deck overlooking her backyard. As soon as she stepped outside, her foot connected with something solid. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat...?\u201d</p><p>A large shoe box sat on the gray deck and the contact with her sandal had knocked the lid askew. Chloe couldn\u2019t see exactly what was inside, but what she could see chilled her blood.</p><p>Feathers spattered with crimson, and thin shattered bones were visible.</p><p>Chloe spun on her heel and ran back into the house, locking the door behind her. She grabbed the phone from its base and dialed Jake\u2019s number.</p> <p>\u201cJake? There\u2019s something on my back deck. I\u2014I think it\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Jake pulled into Chloe\u2019s driveway, loped up the sidewalk and knocked loudly on her door. It was opened by the rumpled, young off-duty cop with bleary eyes who\u2019d spent the night outside her house.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jake.\u201d He jerked his head toward the kitchen. \u201cShe\u2019s in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shoe box with pieces of a dead seagull inside. Looks like somebody blew it up, maybe with a big firecracker of some sort, then put it inside the box. Her name was written in big block letters on the lid. She didn\u2019t touch it and neither did I. I called the PD. They\u2019re sending out someone to collect the evidence and take a report.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Jake strode quickly down the hall and into the kitchen. Chloe sat at the table, cradling a mug of coffee in her hands. She glanced over her shoulder, saw him and stood. Her face was pale, her green eyes dark and vulnerable.</p><p>He held open his arms and she walked into them, her hands clutching the back of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her voice was muffled against his throat. \u201cIt was awful, Jake. Why would anyone do that to a bird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Some people\u2019s actions are beyond understanding.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her hair brushing his throat and chin. \u201cYes.\u201d Her voice was steadier, stronger. She leaned back and looked up at him. \u201cHow long before you catch this person?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe today.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened with interest.</p><p>\u201cI was up most of the night tracking down information on Kenny Dodd. He joined the Marines with a friend, Alan Granstrom. Granstrom\u2019s currently living in Mason city, Oregon, the same town where he grew up. I\u2019m driving down there this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Alan Granstrom might have information about the person stalking us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it could be Granstrom himself who\u2019s following us. When Dodd was killed, Alan Granstrom was there and he blamed me for his death. He went crazy, even threw a few punches at me. I chalked it up to shock and grief under battle pressure and forgot about it. I never thought he\u2019d be carrying a grudge after all this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone has, and it might be him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be him,\u201d Jake said. \u201cIn fact, I hope it is, because then we\u2019ll have a name and a face for our stalker. Up until now, we\u2019ve been looking for a phantom. If we\u2019d been able to get fingerprints from the sedan, we could\u2019ve included Granstrom or ruled him out because his prints are in the military database. But whoever our man is, he was smart enough to wipe the car clean.\u201d Jake paused. \u201cI have to check out Alan Granstrom in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of the day. It\u2019s a three-to-four-hour drive, one way. And I have no idea how long it\u2019ll take to find Granstrom and talk to him. I doubt I\u2019ll be back in Seattle before tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d Chloe said decisively. \u201cI\u2019ll call my department head and ask if someone else can cover my two classes today.\u201d</p><p>Jake thought swiftly, weighing the value of having her safely under his watchful eye versus the unknown situation waiting for him in Oregon. Having her near him, where he could make sure she was safe, won out. \u201cAll right.\u201d He released her and looked at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s after nine. Make your call and get whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Gray going with you?\u201d Chloe asked, suddenly remembering the detective\u2019s interest in their stalker.</p><p>\u201cHe has to testify in court today on another case.\u201d</p><p>Within the hour, they were driving south on Interstate 5 toward Portland, Starbucks lattes in the cup holders on the console between them, the Dave Matthews Band growling out \u201cCrash\u201d on the car\u2019s CD player.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the exit.\u201d Chloe pointed at the highway sign with Mason City spelled out in big white letters against a forest-green background.</p><p>The town\u2019s cluster of buildings was visible from the highway, and Jake slowed to a crawl as they drove through the business center. Shops and stores lined both sides of the wide street, and although small, the town appeared to be prosperous and well kept.</p><p>\u201cAlan Granstrom\u2019s address is 238 Tenth Street.\u201d Jake noted the cross streets as they approached an intersection.</p><p>\u201cWe just passed Eighth,\u201d Chloe said.</p><p>\u201cSo, do we turn right or left on Tenth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vote for left.\u201d</p><p>Jake waited for an oncoming car to pass before he turned left. The Porsche\u2019s engine purred as they moved down the street, which changed from a small-business area to a residential one.</p><p>Chloe peered out the open car window to read house numbers. \u201cSix-forty, six-twenty, six hundred,\u201d she mumbled to herself. \u201cWe\u2019re going in the right direction.\u201d</p><p>The tree-shaded boulevard drowsed in the early afternoon sunshine. Sprinklers arced sprays of water across green lawns and children played at a corner city park.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Chloe pointed to a tidy bungalow, set well back on a neat square of lawn with flower borders edging the walk.</p><p>Jake parked the Porsche at the curb and turned to her. \u201cI want you to stay in the car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Granstrom\u2019s our stalker, there\u2019s no way of knowing how he\u2019ll react. I don\u2019t want you in the line of fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll feel much safer with you than staying out here alone.\u201d</p><p>Jake was silent for a moment. Then he shrugged, thrust open the driver\u2019s side door and got out. By the time he reached the sidewalk, Chloe was waiting for him, impatient to proceed.</p><p>\u201cI hope someone\u2019s home,\u201d she said as they walked to the porch and climbed the steps.</p><p>\u201cSo do I,\u201d Jake agreed. \u201cAnd I hope Granstrom\u2019s our guy.\u201d He rapped on the locked screen door and waited, then rapped again, louder this time.</p><p>\u201cComing!\u201d The feminine voice was followed by the hurried sound of footsteps on a wooden floor. A young woman appeared, a toddler perched on her hip. She studied them through the screen. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for Alan Granstrom. Is he home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014he\u2019s got a day off. Can I tell him who\u2019s visiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend\u2014I served in Afghanistan with Alan. We\u2019re passing through town and just wanted to say hello.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, obviously reassured by Jake\u2019s words, and pushed open the screen. \u201cCome on in.\u201d She raised her voice and half turned to call over her shoulder. \u201cAlan! You have company.\u201d</p><p>The door eased shut behind Jake and Chloe just as the toddler began to cry. The woman patted the baby\u2019s back and waved them toward the living room. \u201cGo on in. Excuse me\u2014I have to change her diaper.\u201d She hurried off, disappearing up the stairs.</p><p>Chloe lifted an eyebrow at Jake, who merely shrugged and gestured toward the room. As they stepped through the archway, he moved ahead of her, placing his body between her and the man walking toward them.</p><p>The lanky, blond-haired man in his early thirties, wearing jeans and a T-shirt, halted abruptly when he saw Jake. \u201cMorrissey? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGranstrom.\u201d Jake nodded hello, his tone neutral. \u201cThis is Chloe Abbott.\u201d</p><p>Chloe and Alan exchanged polite nods before he looked at Jake once again, clearly puzzled.</p><p>\u201cWe have a few questions to ask you about Kenny Dodd,\u201d Jake continued.</p><p>\u201cKenny?\u201d Alan shook his head in confusion. \u201cWhat about Kenny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone threatened Chloe in a document that included Kenny\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Alan\u2019s eyebrows shot up and he stared at Chloe. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. What does that have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty simple. Chloe\u2019s been threatened and stalked by someone in Seattle. So have I. And both our names have been tied to Kenny by the person who\u2019s following us.\u201d Jake\u2019s expression was lethal. \u201cYou went ballistic when Kenny died, and you made it clear that you blamed me for his death. You were the first person I thought of when Kenny\u2019s name came up.\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned and Alan immediately shook his head. \u201cOh, no. You\u2019ve got the wrong guy. In the first place, I haven\u2019t left town. Ask anybody\u2014ask my wife, ask my boss. And even if I had the time, I don\u2019t have the need. I put what happened in Afghanistan behind me when I got out of the marines. I\u2019ve got a life here, a wife, a baby, a decent job.... Nope.\u201d He shook his head again, underlining his words. \u201cThe only person I know who\u2019s still obsessed with Kenny\u2019s death is his dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis father? Have you talked to him recently?\u201d Jake asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. He lives two streets over from me. I\u2019ve known him since I was a kid. Kenny and I grew up together. We were pretty much inseparable, and if he wasn\u2019t at my house, I was at his. We even enlisted together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last see Kenny\u2019s father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two months ago, I guess, maybe a little longer. He was stirred up over a copy of the incident report he finally got from the military about Kenny\u2019s death. Come to think of it...\u201d He paused, eyeing Jake. \u201cHe told me he\u2019d figured the Marines would make you pay for killing Kenny. He ranted about the military failing to make sure justice was done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking all these questions about Kenny\u2019s dad?\u201d Granstrom\u2019s eyes narrowed with suspicion. \u201cWhy should I tell you anything?\u201d</p><p>Jake shrugged. \u201cYou can tell me or you can tell the police. It\u2019s up to you. But if there\u2019s a squad car parked outside your door, the neighbors are going to get curious. Your call.\u201d</p><p>Granstrom\u2019s eyes flickered to the stairway. \u201cAll right, ask your questions,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor starters, what\u2019s his full name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorge Dodd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing late fifties, maybe a bit older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do? Is he retired or still working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a widower. Retired\u2014has been for a few years. He left the union just before my dad did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe union?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. My dad and Kenny\u2019s dad were electricians. They worked out of the Union Hall over in Greensburg.\u201d</p><p>Although a foot of space separated them, Chloe felt Jake tense.</p><p>\u201cYou said Dodd lives near here\u2014do you have his address?\u201d</p><p>Alan gave them the information and after a few more questions and answers, Jake and Chloe left. They were in the car, pulling away from the curb, before Chloe spoke. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis man\u2019s an electrician and he\u2019s retired, which means he has an independent income and can travel. Plus, he has reason to hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, add it all up and George Dodd is looking more and more like our prime suspect.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>They easily located the address Alan had given them. The walkway leading from the street to the front door of the 1940s bungalow was lined with neglected flower beds.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s home,\u201d Chloe said, surveying the ragged grass and yellowing newspapers lying on the doorstep.</p><p>\u201cNot for some time,\u201d Jake agreed. He knocked on the door, then knocked again, harder. There was only silence. \u201cLet\u2019s try around the back.\u201d</p><p>They followed the sidewalk that curved around the house to the rear. Despite the overgrown flower beds, it was apparent that the house itself had been well-cared-for by its owner.</p><p>Jake pounded on the back door. No response. He turned in a slow circle, scanning the backyard. A high wooden fence blocked the neighbors\u2019 view, while the house concealed them from any passerby on the street or sidewalk.</p><p>He bent and slipped a knife from inside his boot.</p> <p>Chloe almost gasped. The blade was long and wickedly lethal. \u201cWhat are you going to do with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlock the door.\u201d He nodded toward the walkway at the side of the house. \u201cKeep watch, will you? Some neighbor might start wondering why a strange car is parked out front.\u201d</p><p>Chloe left the doorstep and peered around the corner of the house. The lawn, sidewalk and the street beyond were quiet in the warm sunshine.</p><p>\u201cAh, got it.\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder. Jake pushed open the door, pausing to slip the knife back into the hidden sheath in his boot top. He beckoned and she left her post to rejoin him.</p><p>They stepped into the silent kitchen, closing the door. The room was spotlessly clean, the tiled floor gleaming, the counters and white cabinets immaculate.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been in a man\u2019s house this clean,\u201d Chloe whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s practically sterile.\u201d</p><p>Jake walked out of the kitchen, with Chloe behind him. The small dining area was as pristine and neat as the kitchen. They passed through it, skirting the square maple table with four chairs aligned precisely opposite each other, and entered the living room. The furnishings were neither expensive nor new, and the sofa, with its matching upholstered chair, had wear marks on the arms, but all was tidy and clean.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see evidence of anything other than that George Dodd is amazingly neat.\u201d She moved down the hall and looked into the bathroom, the door open wide. \u201cAnd even though that\u2019s unusual for a man living alone, it doesn\u2019t prove he\u2019s our crazy stalker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jake\u2019s voice came from farther down the hall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. But I\u2019ve got a feeling about Dodd.\u201d He opened and closed doors, glancing briefly into rooms, before joining Chloe again. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here. It\u2019s clear no one\u2019s been here for some time, and if Dodd is our man, then he\u2019s somewhere in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>They retraced their steps through the living room, dining room and into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Chloe stopped him just before he opened the door leading to the backyard. A phone was mounted on the wall next to the refrigerator. The top corner of the fridge door held a narrow pad of paper with a magnetized back. A pencil stub was attached to the pad by a neatly knotted length of fishing line.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we check the message pad? I\u2019ve read hundreds of mystery novels, and the amateur detectives always check the blank pad for pencil impressions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t hurt. Go for it.\u201d Jake half grinned, waiting patiently while Chloe went to stare at the pad.</p><p>She squinted at it, frowning. \u201cI think he might actually have written something on the pad, then torn off the paper. There seem to be words....\u201d She took the dangling pencil stub and carefully rubbed the lead over the paper.</p><p>Jake bent closer to read the shaded letters. \u201cSunshine Real? No, Sunshine Realty. And the rest is a phone number\u2014with Seattle\u2019s area code.\u201d</p><p>Chloe dropped the pencil and ripped off the sheet. \u201cThe phone number for a Realtor in Seattle? Maybe he used them to find an apartment or a house to rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting you\u2019re right.\u201d He took the paper, folded it and tucked it into his shirt pocket. \u201cSmart lady.\u201d</p><p>They left the house, locking the door behind them. Jake called Gray as soon as they were in the car and on their way out of town.</p><p>\u201cGray? It\u2019s Jake.\u201d He turned onto the highway and headed north. \u201cGranstrom didn\u2019t pan out, but he gave us some valuable information. Kenny Dodd\u2019s father still lives in Mason City. Granstrom says Dodd blames me for Kenny\u2019s death and he left town about eight weeks ago, right after receiving the military incident report.\u201d</p><p>Chloe listened to Jake\u2019s half of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cHold on a sec.\u201d He lowered the phone to hold it and the steering wheel in one hand while he fished the slip of paper out of his pocket with the other. \u201cHe left the phone number of a Seattle realty office on the pad in his kitchen. Want to check it out?\u201d He read off the number, then glanced at Chloe and the corner of his mouth lifted in a half smile. \u201cNo. He tore off the note, but Chloe saw the impression his pencil made on the pad beneath.\u201d</p><p>His smile disappeared. \u201cYeah, do that.\u201d He looked at his dashboard clock. \u201cWe should be back in town by eight or so\u2014too late to do anything tonight. Right, see you tomorrow.\u201d Gray apparently had another question. Jake responded. \u201cNo, she\u2019s staying with me until we figure this out. Right.\u201d</p><p>He rang off, put down the phone and slipped the folded paper back into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cYou told Gray I\u2019m staying with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He met her gaze briefly, then looked again at the empty highway stretching ahead of them. \u201cGut instinct tells me there\u2019s more to this than we know. And I always listen to my gut.\u201d</p><p>Chloe was silent for a moment, considering. \u201cI have to admit I\u2019m more than a little leery about Mr. Dodd myself. So I\u2019ll accept your offer to be my bodyguard until we find him.\u201d His mouth curved in a swift smile, filled with more than a little satisfaction. \u201cBut if you\u2019re offering to guard me just to get me up to your apartment alone...\u201d She paused.</p><p>Jake sent her a questioning glance.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to go to these lengths,\u201d she said softly. \u201cAll you had to do was ask me up to see your etchings. I would\u2019ve said yes.\u201d</p><p>His eyes heated. \u201cI\u2019ll remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love a woman who knows her own mind.\u201d He reached across the console and took her hand from her lap, raised it to his mouth and pressed a hot, openmouthed kiss into her palm. Then he laid her hand, palm down, on his thigh.</p><p>Chloe shivered, fully aware that she\u2019d taken an irrevocable step. Anticipation pulsed through her veins, heated by the flex of powerful muscles beneath her hand as he shifted gears. She settled back and watched the scenery flash by.</p><p>It was after 9:00 p.m. when they arrived in Seattle and turned into the alleyway behind Jake\u2019s building. He triggered a remote control. Ahead of them, a garage door set into the brick wall of the warehouse began to rise. Once they\u2019d driven inside, the headlights swept over the cavernous interior. The door rumbled smoothly down behind them, shutting out the night.</p><p>Chloe had a quick impression of space and high ceilings before Jake switched off the engine and headlights, throwing the area into blackness. The Porsche\u2019s dome light came on when Jake pushed open the door; Chloe got out, too, quickly surveying the surrounding space. Then the big room went dark again. The only illumination came from a glowing yellow bulb mounted over a door at their far right.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax.\u201d Jake caught Chloe\u2019s hand and drew her with him toward the doorway. \u201cAny problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. If anything, it\u2019s too quiet.\u201d A man stepped out of the shadows, an assault weapon cradled in his arms.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope it stays like that.\u201d</p><p>Max nodded and turned away. Chloe noticed light eyes in a handsome face and dark hair tied back at his nape before he disappeared into the shadows.</p><p>\u201cWho was that?\u201d she whispered to Jake as they went through the doorway and climbed a set of stairs.</p><p>\u201cMax Luken. He works for me.\u201d He unlocked a door at the top of the stairway, pushed it inward and waited for Chloe to enter.</p><p>Moonlight poured through skylights, throwing cool light and dark shadows over the apartment.</p><p>Jake\u2019s hands closed over her shoulders and he brushed his mouth against the side of her throat. Chloe turned in his embrace, sliding her arms around his neck.</p><p>He pinned her against the wall with his body and covered her mouth with his.</p><p>\u201cNext time, we\u2019ll make it to the bedroom,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>Jake drove Chloe to UW the next morning, in time for her ten o\u2019clock class, leaving her at the open lecture-hall door. She walked inside and dropped her books on the table, reassured by his solid presence in the shade of the big old walnut tree.</p><p>An hour later, Chloe left the lecture hall by the side door. Despite the unresolved threat posed by George Dodd, anticipation at the prospect of spending the next few hours with Jake made her lighthearted. Her smile faded when she discovered that he wasn\u2019t waiting for her. She reached the tree and stopped beneath its leafy shade, but there was no sign of him anywhere.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she wondered out loud.</p><p>After a few minutes, she gave up and set off alone down the walkway toward Liberty Hall.</p><p>Keys in one hand and cell phone in the other, she punched in Jake\u2019s number as she slipped the office key into the lock. The pile of books in her arms began to slide and she grabbed for the top two but there were too many to catch. Gravity took control and she let the phone slide into her skirt pocket while she struggled to keep from dropping the entire stack.</p><p>\u201cDarn it.\u201d Annoyed, she pushed open the door, concentrating on juggling the armload of books and still hold on to her purse and briefcase while she hurried into her office. She tumbled the pile onto her desk; two of the books kept sliding and hit the floor behind the desk.</p><p>She heard the door click shut.</p><p>\u201cMiss Abbott. How nice of you to join us.\u201d</p><p>Chloe spun to face the closed door. A man stood with his back against it. He wore a gray suit and a cap with Executive Limos embroidered in black above the shiny bill. The small, lethal-looking black gun, pointed directly at her, was rock steady in his hand.</p><p>In the corner to his right was Winifred, her hands secured with plastic handcuffs in front of her, silver duct tape over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cGran!\u201d Chloe jerked, taking a quick instinctive step toward her grandmother. The man\u2019s voice stopped her.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Stay where you are.\u201d He smiled gently. \u201cUnless, of course, you want to see your grandmother hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy name is George Dodd. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve guessed that by now.\u201d</p><p>Jake leaned against the walnut tree\u2019s trunk and watched through the open door as Chloe began her class. Ten minutes into her scheduled hour, his phone rang. Gray had the address of George Dodd\u2019s Seattle residence. Jake immediately paged Max, stationed in the parking lot to watch the Porsche in case Dodd decided to target it. Max took over guard duty for Chloe, and Jake broke speed limits on his way to Capitol Hill.</p><p>Gray was waiting for him on the sidewalk outside a run-down apartment building near downtown Seattle.</p><p>\u201cThis is the address you have for Dodd?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>Jake ran a quick, assessing glance over the old building\u2019s worn facade. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like Dodd. He\u2019s obsessively neat and clean.\u201d</p><p>Gray shrugged. \u201cMaybe he chose this place on purpose because it\u2019s the direct opposite of his usual living space.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be.\u201d Jake followed Gray into the small foyer. \u201cWhat floor is he on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThird. Apartment 302.\u201d Gray looked at the elevator\u2019s grimy buttons and shook his head. \u201cThis thing\u2019s older than dirt. I say we walk up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d</p><p>The third floor of the building had six doors opening off the hallway. The walls were painted institutional green and matched the worn green carpet on the floor. Both men drew weapons, taking opposite sides of the door to Apartment 302.</p><p>\u201cYou got a concealed-weapon permit for that thing?\u201d Gray asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust checkin\u2019. Wouldn\u2019t want to have to arrest you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell. Just open the damn door.\u201d</p> <p>Gray grinned, banging on the door panel. \u201cOpen up. Police.\u201d</p><p>No one answered.</p><p>Gray knocked once more, repeated his words, and was again met with silence.</p><p>Jake bent, slipped the knife from his boot sheath and lifted an eyebrow in silent inquiry.</p><p>Gray rolled his eyes, looked up and down the hallway and nodded.</p><p>It took only seconds for Jake to open the door.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Morrissey, even cops can get busted for breaking and entering,\u201d Gray said as they walked into the small apartment.</p><p>\u201cNo one will ever know,\u201d Jake promised.</p> <p>\u201cNo one except you\u2014and you\u2019ll probably blackmail me.\u201d Gun drawn, Gray moved swiftly across the unit and cleared the bathroom. \u201cNothing here. In fact, this place doesn\u2019t look like anyone lives here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the living room. But the bedroom sure as hell does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in there?\u201d Gray strode to the doorway of the bedroom and stopped abruptly. All four walls were covered with maps, sheets of closely printed notes and blown-up photographs. Some of the photos were of a young man in a Marine uniform, smiling proudly. One wall held pictures of Jake, both alone and with Chloe. What surprised Gray were several photographs of Chloe\u2019s grandmother.</p><p>He stepped inside the room, registering the desk pushed against the far wall, and the computer, monitor and printer atop the dust-free surface. No papers were stacked on the desk, no clutter of pens or paper clips were strewn across the polished wood.</p><p>Jake\u2019s phone rang. Glancing at the caller ID, he flicked it on. \u201cHi, Chloe. What\u2019s up? Chloe?\u201d</p><p>Gray turned from his study of one of the maps to look at him.</p><p>Jake stopped talking. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He listened for a second, then covered the mouthpiece with his fingers and jerked his head toward the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Gray followed him into the hall and closed the door.</p><p>\u201cChloe\u2019s phone is on and I can hear her talking to a man. I think it might be Dodd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>They ran down the stairs, through the lobby and outside. Jake fished in his pocket for his keys and tossed them to Gray. \u201cYou drive. I\u2019ll keep the line open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Gray turned on the ignition and shifted the car into gear.</p><p>\u201cLiberty Hall.\u201d</p><p>Please, Jake, answer your phone. If he didn\u2019t pick up, the call would be switched to the automated answering service.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going for a walk. You will remove the tape from your grandmother\u2019s mouth and place the scarf over her hands.\u201d He gestured with his gun at the crumpled gold silk on the floor at Winifred\u2019s feet.</p><p>Winifred\u2019s gaze, steady and strong, held Chloe\u2019s as she carefully pried loose the tape. The skin beneath was reddened and she winced as the tape came loose.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Gran,\u201d Chloe murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot your fault.\u201d Winifred shifted her gaze to George Dodd when Chloe bent to pick up the scrap of silk. \u201cWhere are you taking us, Mr. Dodd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the Bell Tower.\u201d He smiled and Chloe\u2019s skin prickled with warning. There was no humor in his smile. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged a place for you there.\u201d</p><p>Chloe glanced at Winifred as she carefully wrapped the gold silk around her wrists, concealing the connected loops made of small ties, the kind that came with garbage bags. They effectively bound her hands together. Her grandmother shook her head, a slight, nearly imperceptible movement. Chloe narrowed her eyes to acknowledge the message that she should bide her time, then stepped to the side, facing their captor.</p><p>Dodd noted the scarf. \u201cVery good. Chloe, you will walk ahead of us while your grandmother walks with me. Any attempt on your part to summon help will result in my having to shoot her. We\u2019ll take the South Annex stairway up to the Bell Tower.\u201d He gestured Chloe forward.</p><p>She crossed to the door and opened it.</p><p>\u201cRemember, not a word or your grandmother dies.\u201d</p><p>Chloe nodded. \u201cYou want me to walk ahead of you all the way to the Liberty Hall Bell Tower?\u201d she asked, speaking more loudly than usual.</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said. Outside. Now.\u201d</p><p>She pulled open the door and stepped into the empty hallway.</p><p>Jake, please be listening.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking them to the Bell Tower at Liberty Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich end of the building is that?\u201d</p><p>Jake visualized the map he\u2019d used to find Chloe\u2019s office the first day he\u2019d taken her to lunch. \u201cSouth end. I think there\u2019s a ground-floor entrance.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cDamn it. We\u2019re still at least fifteen minutes away.\u201d</p><p>Gray looked at the traffic around them and turned left, accelerating up a residential street. \u201cMaybe we can shave a few minutes off the time.\u201d He reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his cell phone, handing it to Jake, then quickly downshifting while scanning the intersection ahead of them. \u201cCall it in to the PD. And tell them to alert UW campus security that we have a hostage situation at Liberty Hall.\u201d</p><p>Dodd waved Chloe and Winifred ahead of him into the tower. The room was octagonal, and each wall had wide glass windows, giving it the appearance of a lighthouse tower. The ceiling had a round opening, and high above, the automated bell hung, silent. A deep window ledge created a waist-high shelf that circled the room.</p><p>Chloe\u2019s gaze swept the space as she searched for an advantage, but there was nothing. No furniture, no drapes or blinds on the windows.</p><p>Only one object sat in solitary splendor on the window ledge directly across from them.</p><p>Gran\u2019s birthday clock. How did it get here? Puzzled, she looked at Dodd and found him watching her, a small smile on his thin lips.</p><p>\u201cAh, you recognize the clock, Chloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was a birthday gift for my grandmother. How did it get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI brought it, of course. I took it from the house before I intercepted the limo driver and appropriated his car to collect Mrs. Abbott from the cruise ship this morning.\u201d He nodded approvingly. \u201cMost accommodating of you to make plans that fit so perfectly with mine. Sit down on the floor, Mrs. Abbott.\u201d He waited until Winifred complied, then turned to Chloe. \u201cTurn around and cross your wrists behind your back.\u201d</p><p>Chloe reluctantly obeyed, conscious of his firm, unwavering grip on the handgun.</p><p>He slipped a plastic tie around one of her wrists and threaded a second through the loop before he yanked the first one tight. Then he circled the second around her other wrist. Chloe winced at the pinching and bit back a cry of pain when he pulled it snug.</p><p>\u201cSit on the floor next to your grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Chloe did, and he swiftly looped and tightened nooses around her ankles, binding the ties together with a third length of plastic. Then he did he same thing to Winifred.</p><p>George Dodd stood and smiled down at them. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s only fair that you understand what\u2019s going to happen to you.\u201d He glanced at his watch before walking to the rosewood clock. He turned the clock so they could see the back and opened the small door to expose the intricate workings. A whitish-gray substance now filled the entire space and a small object with wires leading from it was attached to the flashlight battery installed for the alarm.</p><p>A sense of dread overwhelmed Chloe. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDynamite. More specifically, dynamite from Jake Morrissey\u2019s company. It needed to be Jake\u2019s dynamite that destroyed you, Chloe, just as it was his dynamite that killed my son. You see the importance of the continuity and connection, don\u2019t you? Revenge isn\u2019t complete without all the parameters clearly defined.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. He\u2019s completely crazy. Jake, are you listening? Hurry!</p><p>He checked his watch again. \u201cI must leave you. It\u2019s time. You have precisely ten minutes. When the hands on the clock reach twelve, the battery will send electricity through the alarm to the detonator cap and set off the dynamite.\u201d He smiled benevolently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t feel a thing. Only Morrissey will feel\u2014he\u2019ll suffer when you\u2019re gone. I\u2019m sorry to have to use you, but this was the only way to punish him.\u201d He looked out the window. \u201cThe Bell Tower at McGyver Hall has a perfect view so I can watch Jake Morrissey as his world explodes.\u201d He turned and walked to the door. \u201cGoodbye, ladies.\u201d</p><p>And he left, quietly closing the door. The sound of his footsteps as he moved quickly down the stairs faded away.</p><p>\u201cGran, reach into my pocket.\u201d Chloe rolled to her knees and shifted closer to Winifred.</p><p>Winifred didn\u2019t question her. Instead, using both hands, she pulled the cell phone out of the square pocket of Chloe\u2019s full skirt and held it steady while Chloe bent over.</p><p>\u201cJake! Jake, are you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChloe, thank God! Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But Dodd put dynamite in Gran\u2019s clock and set it to go off in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d Jake\u2019s curse carried clearly over the phone. \u201cCan you get out of the room to safety?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur hands and feet are bound together. I don\u2019t think we\u2019d make it down the stairs and away from the building in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about the clock.\u201d</p><p>Chloe studied it. \u201cAntique, glass face, musical figures on top. And it was modernized with a battery-operated alarm at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s using the battery for ignition.\u201d Jake\u2019s mind raced. \u201cYou said it has a glass face?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you reach the hands on the clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Gran, we need to get closer to the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloser to the dynamite?\u201d Winifred\u2019s eyebrows winged upward.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t find a way to disarm it, it\u2019s not going to matter how close we are. The whole tower will be gone and us with it.\u201d</p><p>Winifred nodded, clutching the phone in her bound hands, and rolled across the short expanse of bare wood floor after Chloe. Panting, both women struggled to their knees, their heads and shoulders even with the low window ledge where the clock sat.</p><p>\u201cGran, see if you can open the glass face.\u201d</p><p>Winifred lifted her hands, set the phone carefully on the ledge and slipped the little brass hook free to swing open the round glass face.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d she murmured, her brow dotted with nervous perspiration. She picked up the phone and held it to Chloe\u2019s ear.</p> <p>\u201cWe have the glass open, Jake, and we can reach the hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis sounds too simple to work, Chloe, but it\u2019s the only chance. I want you to tell Winifred to slowly move the minute hand back thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? Are you sure it\u2019ll work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m betting your life on it. And, Chloe, before you tell Winifred...I just want you to know, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Tears gathered in her eyes. \u201cI love you, too, Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Winifred to move the hands slowly.\u201d His voice was rough with emotion.</p> <p>\u201cGran, Jake wants you to move the minute hand backward\u2014thirty minutes. Do it slowly.\u201d</p><p>Winifred barely hesitated, drew a deep breath and, without a tremor in her fingers, lifted her bound hands and carefully, slowly, reversed the minute hand.</p><p>Both women held their breaths, waiting for an explosion. But the clock merely ticked steadily on.</p><p>\u201cChloe? Chloe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Jake. Gran did it\u2014and the dynamite didn\u2019t go off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, get the hell out of there, as fast as you can. We\u2019re in the parking lot. I\u2019ll be there in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Chloe looked at her grandmother. \u201cJake says to get out if we can.\u201d</p><p>Winifred nodded, dropped the phone and clambered to her feet beside Chloe. Hampered by the hobbles on their ankles, they could only take tiny steps. They managed to reach the door, fumble it open and step onto the landing before they heard the sound of a car below. Doors slammed, feet pounded on the stairs.</p> <p>Jake reached Chloe first, swinging her off her feet and slinging her over his shoulder. Gray picked up Winifred and followed close on Jake\u2019s heels as he ran back down the stairs and out of the building. Sirens screamed; police cars and fire trucks drove across the lawn to join the campus police and surround the building.</p><p>Jake lowered Chloe to the grass and knelt beside her to run his hands over her face, down her arms, testing to be sure she was whole. Ignoring the many onlookers, he retrieved his knife and cut her bonds.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jake, honestly.\u201d With difficulty, Chloe sat up. \u201cDid the police catch Dodd?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head, looking swiftly at the surrounding chaos. \u201cI doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might still be here. He said he was going to watch the explosion from the tower at McGyver Hall.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s eyes flared, and his face grew hard.</p><p>\u201cGo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She pushed at his arm, reading his unwillingness to leave her. \u201cGran\u2019s here\u2014and so is half the campus and most of the police and fire departments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d Jake pressed a quick, fierce kiss to her mouth and stood. Gray joined him and they ran toward McGyver Hall.</p><p>Moments later, Chloe and Winifred\u2014whose ties had been released by a paramedic\u2014were in the back seat of a police car. An officer had provided them with paper cups of hot coffee from a machine. They sat in semi-isolation, each cradling a cup while the organized chaos of a crime scene unfolded outside.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I told you I wouldn\u2019t mind a little excitement in my life, but this wasn\u2019t exactly what I meant,\u201d Winifred said, her eyes twinkling.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Gran.\u201d Chloe studied her grandmother\u2019s crumpled linen pantsuit and silk blouse. Her white curls were disheveled, but her eyes gleamed with energy. \u201cGran, I need some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m in love with Jake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Winifred waited, clearly expecting more.</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s not active military anymore, but he\u2019s a soldier at heart and he looks at life from a warrior\u2019s viewpoint. And his job is dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem for you?\u201d Winifred asked gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve always chosen a quiet life.\u201d Chloe waved a hand at the campus around them. \u201cI picked an academic career filled with books and study. How will Jake and I manage to blend our lives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Richard was a warrior.\u201d</p><p>Chloe felt her eyes widen. \u201cGranddad? He was a sweetie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he was,\u201d Winifred agreed. \u201cBut he was also a warrior. I was a soldier\u2019s bride, as you know, and he went away to war when we\u2019d been married for just two months. I thought we knew each other so well\u2014after all, we grew up together. But war changes a man, or maybe it\u2019s fairer to say that war strips a man down to his very core. Richard was steel, solid steel. The bravest man I\u2019ve ever known. But with me and the rest of his family, he was a teddy bear.\u201d Winifred\u2019s voice wavered and she paused, sipping her coffee. \u201cWe had a wonderful marriage, Chloe. More than fifty years, and though he\u2019s been gone for six years, I miss him every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Gran.\u201d Chloe hugged her, moved beyond words at the wisdom and love apparent in her words and expression.</p><p>The door of the squad car opened and Chloe looked over her shoulder. Jake stood there, a frown growing as he searched her features. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She glanced at her grandmother.</p><p>\u201cDid you arrest that awful man?\u201d Winifred asked, leaning forward to look past Chloe at Jake.</p><p>Jake nodded. \u201cA UW janitor saw Dodd toss his gun into the bushes outside Liberty Hall and followed him to McGyver Tower. When Dodd went into the tower room, the janitor locked him in and called the campus police to report Dodd for littering.\u201d</p><p>Chloe laughed out loud. \u201cThat must\u2019ve been Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFred tends to view any littering at Liberty Hall as a personal affront.\u201d</p><p>Jake lifted an eyebrow in query, but Chloe just smiled at him without explaining further. He turned back to her grandmother. \u201cThe Seattle PD have Dodd in custody. He confessed to assaulting the limo driver and forcing him to strip off his uniform before making him climb in the trunk. I\u2019m guessing Dodd used the gun butt or a tire iron to knock the man out so he couldn\u2019t make any noise and alert passersby. All of which happened before Dodd picked you up at the cruise dock, Winifred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe poor driver!\u201d Winifred exclaimed. \u201cWas he badly injured?\u201d</p><p>Jake shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s been taken to Harborview Hospital, but the paramedics checked him out after the police removed him from the limo trunk. They seem convinced he wasn\u2019t hurt beyond a few bruises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank goodness.\u201d Winifred heaved a sigh of relief and made a shooing gesture with her free hand, the other occupied with balancing her cup. \u201cScoot, Chloe. I\u2019ll be fine here, drinking my coffee and contemplating my nice, quiet life.\u201d</p><p>Chloe slid across the seat and into Jake\u2019s arms. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you showed up at the tower when you did,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTo put it mildly...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d He nudged the car door shut and drew her away from the crowd to the far side of an empty ambulance. Then he wrapped her in his arms and kissed her breathless. Chloe kissed him back with all the emotion generated by the chaotic, terror-filled day.</p><p>He raised his head and stared at her, breathing harshly. \u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, she couldn\u2019t get her vocal cords to work.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, marriage. I realize we\u2019ve only known each other a couple weeks, but we\u2019ve been through more in these past days than most couples go through in a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d He sounded as stunned as she\u2019d felt earlier.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her warily. \u201cYou\u2019re not shell-shocked from stress? You\u2019re not going to claim battlefield memory loss later on?\u201d</p><p>Chloe laughed. \u201cNo. But I\u2019m warning you, my grandmother wants great-grandchildren. And soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can manage that.\u201d He smiled lazily, his eyes hot. Then he bent his head and took her mouth with his once more.</p><p>Professor Weds Warrior, she thought blissfully. And then she stopped thinking and gave in to emotion.</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Sent: May 25th</p><p>Subject: Good morning\u2014</p><p>Dear Clara,</p><p>So much has happened since we said good-bye and I left you at the Seattle docks yesterday.

I swear, Clara, I thought I was going to have a heart attack from sheer fright before Chloe spoke with Jake on her cell phone and he told us how to defuse the bomb.

To those of you who\u2019ve read The Other Twin and Another Man\u2019s Son, the charming town of Sarah\u2019s Orchard will be a familiar one. To those of you who are new to my stories, I hope you\u2019ll find the fictional locale, and its characters, a pleasant place to visit. I\u2019ll probably return to Sarah\u2019s Orchard in the future. I love the setting and can envision a wedding, with all the trimmings and intrigues, at the Orchard Inn.</p><p>In the meantime, I\u2019ve wandered off to Chicago for The Cinderella Hour, which will be published in paperback in August. It was the right place, I thought, to tell the love story of Snow Ashley Gable and Luke Kilcannon. I hope you agree! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And this summer\u2019s new hardcover, Caroline\u2019s Journal, also to be published in August, is set in my own hometown, Seattle.</p><p>I hope you enjoy The Apple Orchard and, if the spirit moves you, the other books.

So would Marianne, his mom. Dennis would take Nick\u2019s being late out on her, too.</p><p>How many times, Dennis would shout, had he made it clear that if Nick wasn\u2019t home from school by three-thirty, the house would be locked, the burglar alarm set, and Nick would have to wait outside until his mom and Dennis returned from work at 1:00 a.m.?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t an idle threat. Since September, when Marianne and Nick had moved to Sarah\u2019s Orchard to live with Dennis, Nick had spent five nights outside. Dennis didn\u2019t care that Nick had an excuse for his tardiness. In each instance, the entire second-grade class\u2014Nick\u2019s class\u2014at Orchard Elementary had been dismissed late. It wasn\u2019t because of bad behavior, Nick had tried to explain. All five times there\u2019d been something to celebrate.</p><p>Today\u2019s celebration, a Christmas party, was worth whatever punishment Dennis chose to inflict. It didn\u2019t matter how cold Nick would be by the time Dennis and Marianne returned. Nick\u2019s teacher had played the piano, and all the second-graders had gathered round to sing carols. The students took turns singing verses. No one laughed when words were forgotten or the tune was off key.</p><p>Nick wasn\u2019t sure his classmates even detected the discordant notes. He did. He couldn\u2019t help it. According to his teacher, he had perfect pitch. He hadn\u2019t known it before enrolling at Orchard Elementary. In fact, seven-year-old Nicholas Lawton hadn\u2019t even realized he could sing.</p><p>But he could, and he loved it.</p> <p>He\u2019d sing carols tonight, he decided as he ran toward the house\u2014two miles away\u2014where Dennis was probably shouting already. He\u2019d sing as he froze on the porch. His carols would be sung quietly and in the shadows. The neighbors mustn\u2019t know he was alone every evening, Dennis had warned, whether he was guarding Dennis\u2019s house from the outside or within.</p><p>That was Nick\u2019s job, to make certain no one tried to break in while Dennis and Marianne were at the tavern where cocktail waitress Marianne served the drinks that bartender Dennis poured. Dennis made drugs in the basement of the dilapidated house on Center Street. Nick had never seen the lab. The door was always locked.</p><p>If not for his illegal enterprise, Dennis wouldn\u2019t have cared when Nick got home from school. It wasn\u2019t Nick\u2019s comfort\u2014food, shelter, warmth\u2014that made him furious when Nick was so late Dennis had to leave before he arrived. Dennis wanted Nick inside, awake and watchful, ready to call the tavern should anyone approach.</p><p>Nick had made a number of such calls. Dennis had never thanked him, but he\u2019d come home right away. He\u2019d yelled at the uninvited visitors, and on two occasions, he\u2019d waved his gun around until they left. Even when he\u2019d stopped yelling long enough to sell drugs to the intruders, he\u2019d warned them that any future transactions would take place only at the bar.</p><p>Dennis could\u2019ve given Nick the code for the burglar alarm. That way, Nick could let himself in on the afternoons he was late, reset the alarm once inside and be close to the phone if he needed it. Nick wasn\u2019t tall enough to reach the alarm panel. But if Dennis put a chair beneath it...</p><p>Nick made the mistake of suggesting to Dennis that he give him the code. Dennis laughed in a mean way, laughing at Nick for being so stupid as to imagine he\u2019d trust him to begin with, much less trust that once he had the code, he wouldn\u2019t simply leave the house and spend the evening elsewhere instead of \u201cearning his keep.\u201d</p><p>Nick was doing his best to make it home before Dennis locked him out. He was running as fast as he could. He didn\u2019t even slow his pace as he neared the apple orchard for which the town had been named.</p><p>Nick knew the town\u2019s history. All Orchard Elementary second-graders did. Their teacher believed it was important for them to know, and told the story in a fairy-tale way. Nick loved this story; he\u2019d memorized its every detail.</p> <p>Many years ago, the tale began, Dr. James Keeling and his wife, Sarah, moved from the big city, Portland, to what was then the farming community of Riverville.</p><p>The Keelings had an apple tree in Portland. Sarah treasured the tree and its apples. The tree was too large to be transplanted, but the cuttings Sarah took flourished on the small piece of Riverville farmland the town\u2019s new doctor had purchased.</p><p>Apples hadn\u2019t been grown in Riverville until Sarah planted her orchard. But they became the crop of Riverville, which was renamed Sarah\u2019s Orchard in honor of the doctor\u2019s wife. Sarah\u2019s husband left a legacy, too. The Keeling Clinic. Renowned for its exceptional staff and unsurpassed expertise in any number of medical specialties, the clinic was a referral center for patients from coast to coast.</p><p>Sarah\u2019s acre of apples had been a family orchard, not a working one, and that was how it stayed.</p><p>All the town\u2019s orchards were beautiful when the apples were ripening and the leaves were green. But Nick thought the orchard that had been Sarah\u2019s remained beautiful even after the fruit was plucked and the branches were bare.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what made the trees beckon to him on these wintry afternoons. He knew only that they did. Time permitting, he always paused to catch his breath against the orchard\u2019s three-railed fence. And on the afternoons when he dashed out of the classroom the moment the dismissal bell sounded, there was time, once his breath returned, to sing a song or two.</p><p>Nick wished he could sing carols, even one carol, to the apple trees on this December day. Or, having made sure that Dennis and his mom had already left the house on Center Street, he could go back to the orchard and spend the evening here. It wouldn\u2019t feel as cold\u2014here. Somehow the barren trees would warm him.</p><p>But on the nights Nick was forced to keep vigil from the porch, Dennis would get tavern customers, drunken ones, to drop by. They were supposed to confirm that Nick was there\u2014and that, as they approached, he demand to know who they were and what they wanted.</p><p>Nick ran past the orchard, stumbling\u2014but not falling\u2014as he took his eyes from the path ahead to the trees he wanted to see. In the distance he saw the farmhouse.</p><p>When the Keelings lived there, it had been painted white and teal\u2014which, his teacher explained, was a blend of green and blue. The new owners kept the original color scheme until the end of World War Two. With the help of the entire town, the young bride painted it daffodil-yellow with butter-cream trim. She wanted it to look like a beacon, to guide her soldier husband home.</p><p>The soldier must have liked the beacon. The farmhouse was still yellow and cream, glowing to Nick even on cloudy afternoons.</p><p>Today, the house also glowed from within. All the lights were on. The eaves were adorned for Christmas, as were the apple trees that lined the drive. Those closest to the house twinkled white. Along the drive itself the trees were wrapped in lights the color of ripe apples.</p><p>For the past three weeks, Nick had noticed the strands coiled around the trunks and limbs. Until today, the Christmas lights hadn\u2019t been illuminated when he ran by. It wasn\u2019t twilight even now. But the trees were shining. The family was celebrating, too. It was a large gathering, Nick saw. The partygoers had overflowed to the porch, and the grounds.</p><p>They seemed to be searching. And shouting. Their shouts weren\u2019t angry, like Dennis\u2019s\u2014or his mom\u2019s previous boyfriends\u2019.</p><p>These shouts sounded worried.</p><p>The road dipped, leaving the farmhouse and its noises behind. The orchard entrance lay ahead, at the bottom of the long, steep drive. The entrance was twinkling, an archway of red and white, and just inside, at the base of a lighted tree, was a sobbing child.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t very old. Two or so. And she was really sobbing. The kind of hiccupping wails that only grew silent when it became necessary for her to breathe.</p><p>Nick had witnessed such sobbing before. Marianne\u2019s boyfriend before Dennis had a two-year-old daughter who cried like this. Nick hadn\u2019t been allowed to comfort her. She needed to learn not to cry, her father had said.</p><p>No one was forbidding Nick to comfort this sobbing girl. Without hesitation he ran to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry!\u201d he implored.</p><p>She looked at him and immediately wailed.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem injured, although her holly-green tights had dirt stains at the knees. Nor did she seem cold; in her heavy Christmas sweater, she was probably warmer than Nick.</p><p>Maybe she was scared.</p><p>Maybe a carol would help.</p><p>\u201cJingle Bells\u201d wasn\u2019t Nick\u2019s favorite. \u201cA Midnight Clear\u201d was.</p><p>But \u201cJingle Bells\u201d might cheer her up, if she could hear his singing above her cries.</p><p>She could, and when she did, she stared at him. It was a bold stare and, at first, an indignant one\u2014as if she\u2019d been enjoying a perfectly good cry and how dare he make it end?</p><p>Then she smiled, beamed. Her stare had been one of surprise, he decided, not indignation. Surprise that what had felt like hopelessness could be vanquished by a song.</p><p>\u201cYou belong up there, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked, glancing at the drive. \u201cYou\u2019re the reason everyone\u2019s searching. They probably figure there\u2019s no way you could\u2019ve made it this far.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say anything, but the smile disappeared and new tears threatened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start crying again, okay? I\u2019d better carry you.\u201d Assuming he could lift her.</p><p>She was a healthy toddler. He was small for his age. Very small, as Dennis\u2014and others\u2014never failed to point out.</p><p>She was heavy. Nick staggered a little under her weight. It helped when she curled her arms around his neck and hung on.</p><p>Nick began singing, and she joined in.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Jingle bells,\u2019\u201d she crooned. \u201c\u2018All the way.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Her jumbled lyrics were nothing compared to the tune she couldn\u2019t carry.</p><p>But she had a happy voice, and the tears were gone. She\u2019d obviously concluded that it wasn\u2019t so bad, in fact fun, to be carried up the hill. She pointed to the twinkling branches overhead and giggled as she sang.</p><p>When they reached the crest of the hill and were spotted by a searcher who shouted the wonderful news, she was immediately surrounded by the kind of love Nick wouldn\u2019t have believed existed if he hadn\u2019t seen it with his own eyes.</p><p>Whisked from his arms, the girl was held jointly by her weeping parents while the large circle of people who loved her wept, laughed and marveled that she\u2019d wandered so far, so fast\u2014especially since, or so they\u2019d thought, they were all keeping an eye on her.</p><p>In moments, the toddler and her entourage were moving as one toward the farmhouse. Nick was halfway down the drive when he heard the male voice behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait, son! Please.\u201d</p><p>No one had ever called him son. His own dad \u201csplit\u201d the day his mom told him she was pregnant. Whenever Marianne\u2019s boyfriends bothered to call him anything, they invariably came up with a cruel reminder of how small he was.</p><p>There\u2019d also never been anyone who\u2019d wanted to talk to him as much as the man who was jogging to catch him.</p><p>The man wasn\u2019t alone. A woman jogged beside him.</p> <p>The driveway was so steep that the man and woman towered over Nick more than they would have if they\u2019d all been standing on level ground.</p><p>The couple crouched down, and it didn\u2019t feel mean or insulting. They just wanted to look him straight in the eyes.</p><p>Their eyes, Nick noticed, glistened with tears.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>Nick hesitated. He could see this man showing up at Dennis\u2019s house and being shouted at by Dennis. Hating the image, he replied with a shrug.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m Charles MacKenzie, and this is my wife, Clara. We\u2019re Elizabeth\u2019s grandma and grandpa, and we can\u2019t tell you how grateful we are that you saved her. If she\u2019d gone across the road...\u201d The voice faltered.</p><p>\u201cShe was sitting down,\u201d Nick said. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have crossed the road. I don\u2019t think she was running away. Was she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens, no!\u201d Clara replied. \u201cShe was just fascinated by the lights on the trees. The minute I turned them on, she started pointing to them. She loves bright colors. I\u2019ll bet she loved your bright blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t have bright blue eyes. At least, the last time he\u2019d looked, they were gray. But if this nice lady wanted to think his eyes were bright blue, that was okay with him. He wished they were. For her.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t imagine Elizabeth would go outside,\u201d Charles murmured. \u201cOr that she could get outside with all of us watching her. But she did, and you saved her. You must live nearby?\u201d</p><p>Nick shrugged again. \u201cI better go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let us drive you home? It\u2019s getting dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you join us for dinner? We could call your parents and invite them, too. We\u2019d like to tell them what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, they\u2019re\u2014\u201d Not home. Nick was certain it was true, that Dennis and his mom had already left for work. If he told these kind people he\u2019d be alone for the evening, they\u2019d really want him to stay for dinner, and when Dennis sent one of his customers to check on him and he wasn\u2019t there...\u201cI have to go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Charles said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to keep you. But here\u2019s something for you to remember. If you ever need anything\u2014anything at all\u2014you come to us. Just walk up this driveway, knock on the door and say \u2018I\u2019m the boy who rescued Elizabeth.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even need to say that much,\u201d Clara said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see your blue eyes and know who you are. But if it seems that our eyes are failing us, if for some reason you think we might\u2019ve forgotten, even though we never will, you can say \u2018I\u2019m Elizabeth\u2019s hero.\u2019\u201d Clara didn\u2019t ask if that was okay with Nick. Instead, she added, \u201cI really wish you\u2019d let me send you home with some Christmas cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should take her up on that, son. She\u2019s a terrific cook. Do you like apple butter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never tasted it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen it\u2019s time you did. My Clara makes the best apple butter in the world. Could we get you to take a jar or two?\u201d</p><p>He was so tempted, not by the offer of food, but by the kindness that came with it. \u201cNo. Thank you. I have to go.\u201d Now. If he didn\u2019t, he might not ever leave.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Thank you, Elizabeth\u2019s hero. And please remember what we told you. We\u2019re here if you need us.\u201d</p><p>How could he ever forget? Nick wondered as he continued his journey home.</p><p>He ran, even though he knew his destination would be a locked house and a frigid porch. The sooner he put distance between himself and what he wanted so much\u2014but would never have\u2014the better.</p><p>He must have run faster than he\u2019d ever run before. In no time he rounded the corner where Dennis\u2019s house would come into view.</p><p>Dennis\u2019s pickup was in the drive and a rental truck, like the U-Haul Dennis had rented to move Nick and Marianne from Medford to Sarah\u2019s Orchard, was parked out front.</p><p>Dennis, his mom and two of Dennis\u2019s friends were loading the vehicles. It wasn\u2019t just his mom\u2019s furniture that was being loaded, but Dennis\u2019s, as well. And there were things Nick had never seen. Equipment from the basement, he supposed.</p><p>No one shouted at him for being late. His mom simply told him they were leaving the second the trucks were loaded\u2014about five minutes from now. Any belongings he hadn\u2019t put on the van by then would be left behind.</p><p>Would he have been left behind if he\u2019d accepted Mrs. MacKenzie\u2019s offer of apple butter and cookies?</p><p>The question would haunt Nick for years to come. How different his life might\u2019ve been if he\u2019d returned to the daffodil-yellow farmhouse in the middle of that very night.</p><p>I\u2019m Elizabeth\u2019s...hero, he would\u2019ve said through chattering teeth. Remember me? I\u2019ve been waiting on a run-down porch on Center Street for my mom and her boyfriend to get home from work. It\u2019s been hours since they should\u2019ve returned, and when I looked through the windows I didn\u2019t see any furniture inside. I\u2019m pretty cold. And sort of hungry. Could I...could I come in?</p><p>But Nicholas Lawton did leave Sarah\u2019s Orchard that December night.</p><p>It would be twenty-four years before he made his way back. Found his way home.</p><p>One</p><p>San Francisco, California</p><p>Friday, July 7, 12:30 p.m.</p><p>Present day</p><p>Elizabeth Charlotte Winslow was smiling. She\u2019d just picked up her wedding invitations and was delighted with the result. She\u2019d designed them herself. And although her concept hadn\u2019t been a huge departure\u2014a different font, a more interesting format\u2014from what Atherton heiresses had mailed to their wedding guests for as long as anyone could recall, her mother, Abigail MacKenzie Winslow, had been wary.</p><p>It would be fine, Elizabeth had insisted. The gilt edging hadn\u2019t been forsaken, and the parchment itself was more expensive than paper had any right to be.</p><p>It was fine, as her mother would acknowledge when she saw the invitations...in forty minutes or so. Elizabeth wanted to make a brief stop before heading south to Atherton and her parents\u2019 Lilac Lane home.</p><p>She was in the second week of the nine she\u2019d spend living with her parents until her September wedding to Matthew Blaine. It was also the second week of her first carefree summer since she\u2019d graduated from Atherton High.</p><p>She\u2019d taken courses that summer. Advanced-placement courses that had helped her get her undergraduate degree from Stanford\u2014and be admitted to Stanford Law\u2014in three years, not four. She\u2019d also taken classes each undergraduate summer and clerked during law school vacations and had spent the summer after graduation studying for the California bar.</p><p>Then it was off to L.A., where, as a prosecutor, she\u2019d tried cases, and won cases, year round. There hadn\u2019t been any carefree summers in eleven years. No carefree autumns, winters or springs, either.</p><p>Two weeks ago, the jury had returned its guilty verdict on her swan-song case in L.A. She\u2019d flown home the next day, and despite the occasional feeling that she was playing hooky, she was adapting well to her newfound freedom.</p><p>In fact, she was enjoying it so much, she hadn\u2019t yet made the offer to her new boss, the San Francisco D.A., that she\u2019d intended to make. Even though her official start date was October 1, she\u2019d tell him she was available to do preliminary work on the cases she\u2019d be handling. So far the delights of a lazy summer had overcome that urge.</p><p>There were people\u2014her mother, Matthew\u2019s mother and the wedding coordinator\u2014who were unhappy with Elizabeth\u2019s notion of a carefree summer leading up to the Winslow-Blaine nuptials. There were myriad decisions to make, all of which they regarded as critical. Elizabeth\u2019s plan had been to be peripherally\u2014but cheerfully\u2014involved. Whatever the mothers wanted. She hadn\u2019t imagined there\u2019d be issues, like the invitations, on which she\u2019d felt strongly enough to voice a preference.</p><p>There were other choices she would\u2019ve made differently. Fewer bridal showers. A less grand dress. And, as it became clear that her wedding\u2014and the festivities leading up to it\u2014was the event of the season, a nice middle-of-the-night elopement to Lake Tahoe sounded more and more appealing. But Elizabeth was picking her battles.</p><p>And Matthew, smartly, was remaining out of the fray. It wouldn\u2019t be a carefree summer for him. As an investment banker, her fianc\u00e9 had several major deals in the works. He hoped to bring them all to lucrative conclusions before the wedding. It would require long hours and frequent travel, but he believed it could be done.</p><p>He\u2019d been in New York for the past three days. He\u2019d be coming home late tonight\u2014too late, he\u2019d said, for her to meet him at the airport, or at his Pacific Heights home, which would become theirs in September.</p><p>Matthew\u2019s house was Elizabeth\u2019s brief stop before driving to Atherton. Matthew wouldn\u2019t be seeing her tonight, but he\u2019d be able to see their invitations. If he wanted to. Matthew wasn\u2019t any more desperate to see the engraved proof of their impending wedding than Elizabeth would\u2019ve been if she hadn\u2019t insisted on the changes.</p><p>As Elizabeth made the short drive from Shreve &amp; Company on Union Square, she confronted the real reason for her detour to Matthew\u2019s empty house before returning home. Once her mother acknowledged that the invitations were at least as elegant as the traditional ones, the logical next step would be for Elizabeth to begin addressing them.</p><p>There\u2019d been a minor skirmish on that point. The mothers had wanted to hire a calligrapher. Elizabeth didn\u2019t do calligraphy, but her handwriting was legible. Presentable. Even if it wasn\u2019t, so what? This was her wedding. She wanted to address the invitations herself. She was a little surprised, she told the dismayed faces, that all brides didn\u2019t feel the same way.</p><p>The idea of spending the afternoon addressing invitations should have been a happy one. It would\u2019ve been, had the recipient of the first invitation she was going to address been excited about receiving it\u2014about the wedding itself.</p><p>But unless she\u2019d magically changed her opinion of her granddaughter\u2019s groom-to-be, Clara MacKenzie wouldn\u2019t be excited at all. Elizabeth\u2019s detour to Matthew\u2019s was, therefore, a stalling tactic.</p><p>Since Monday night, Elizabeth had studiously avoided thinking about the phone conversation with her grandmother.</p><p>She needed to replay it, and there was no time like the present.</p><p>She\u2019d made the call to Sarah\u2019s Orchard, a thank-you for the lovely July Fourth weekend she and Matthew had just spent at the farmhouse, and for the wonderful party Gram had thrown in their honor at the Orchard Inn.</p><p>The thank-you had been heartfelt. So was Elizabeth\u2019s hope that she\u2019d hear Gram\u2019s enthusiastic approval of the man she was going to marry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It hadn\u2019t been a far-fetched hope. She\u2019d expected Gram to be as pleased with the match as everyone else.</p><p>But...</p><p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s the one?\u201d Clara had asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. But you aren\u2019t. Why not?\u201d When Gram hadn\u2019t been forthcoming with answer, Elizabeth had provided possible concerns herself. \u201cIs it because he\u2019s ten years older than I am?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even realize he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr because he\u2019s thinking about going into politics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than thinking,\u201d Gram had replied. \u201cIt sounds like his run for the Senate is a sure thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. And with his beautiful, brilliant wife at his side, he\u2019s certain to win.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why he\u2019s marrying me.\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s statement had been emphatic, and so stern it had blocked the question that begged to be asked. You think it is? She\u2019d sensed the question, of course. Rolled right over it. \u201cOurs may not be the love you and Granddad had. What love is? But we\u2019re extremely compatible. I\u2019ve done some dating, you know. I have my own previous relationships to compare this one to. That\u2019s what I have to compare it to, Gram. My relationships, not yours and Granddad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do! And Matthew loves me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you sing for him?\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth couldn\u2019t carry a tune. She knew it. Anyone who\u2019d ever heard her knew it. It had been years\u2014decades\u2014since she\u2019d inflicted her tonelessness on the world. Not since the carefree summers she\u2019d spent in Sarah\u2019s Orchard as a girl. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always sang for Granddad and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but...\u201d You\u2019re my grandparents. You love me unconditionally. \u201cMatthew doesn\u2019t need to hear me sing.\u201d</p><p>Before the phone call had ended, Gram had made an effort to soften her position. But it had been damning with faint praise. She didn\u2019t dislike Matthew. She didn\u2019t believe him to be a serial killer in disguise. She just didn\u2019t think he was the man for her only granddaughter. And she\u2019d said, so quietly Elizabeth almost hadn\u2019t heard it, that Charles wouldn\u2019t think so, either.</p><p>Maybe that was what Gram\u2019s reaction to Matthew was really about. Granddad. The man Gram had loved for sixty-five years had died last November. It wasn\u2019t in Gram\u2019s nature to give up on life, and she hadn\u2019t. And she had the support of her family, her town and, perhaps most importantly, of Winifred and Helen. Both had known and loved Clara\u2014and Charles\u2014for more than sixty of those sixty-five years.</p><p>It had been their men, their soldiers, who\u2019d brought them together. Sam had needed witnesses for his wedding, and friends for his friendless bride. They\u2019d become close friends, all six of them. Over time, Helen and Winifred had lost their beloved husbands. Now Gram had lost hers. Elizabeth had no doubt that Gram\u2019s friends were reaching out to her as Gram and Granddad had reached out to them when Sam and Richard had died.</p><p>But Gram had to miss Granddad, deeply and desperately, every day.</p><p>That was how Elizabeth felt about losing Granddad, too.</p> <p>Elizabeth wished Gram could be happy about her wedding, wished it\u2019d given her something hopeful to look forward to.</p><p>It worried Elizabeth more than she\u2019d been willing to admit\u2014until this very moment\u2014that it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>This very moment coincided with her arrival at Matthew\u2019s.</p><p>The silver Accord parked in his driveway was unexpected. And familiar. Its vanity plate confirmed its owner to be Matthew\u2019s executive assistant, Janine\u2014the same Janine who\u2019d been Matthew\u2019s date at the New Year\u2019s Eve gala at the Carlton Club where Matthew and Elizabeth had met.</p><p>Elizabeth had been home for the holidays, accompanying her parents to the social events of the season. Matthew had called her the following day, and by the time Elizabeth returned to L.A., she and Matthew were making plans for a future.</p><p>It was during a weekend visit in March that Elizabeth had seen Janine\u2019s Accord. She\u2019d arrived at Matthew\u2019s just as Janine, who\u2019d dropped off some financial statements Matthew needed to review, was leaving. She\u2019d also learned from her mother that there\u2019d been a \u201cdreadful\u201d few months when Matthew\u2019s parents had lived in \u201cperpetual fear\u201d that Matthew might marry Janine. Like Elizabeth, Matthew was an only child\u2014and sole heir to a substantial fortune.</p><p>Matthew had told Elizabeth that rumors of his possible engagement to Janine were greatly exaggerated. She\u2019d been a lover. That was all. He\u2019d said it dismissively, as if the assistant who drove the Accord wasn\u2019t \u201cwife material.\u201d When Elizabeth called him on what sounded like elitism, he\u2019d apologized right away.</p><p>Elizabeth hadn\u2019t known Janine would be traveling with Matthew to New York. They must have rendezvoused early Tuesday at his home, where his Jaguar was parked in the garage, and shared a limo to SFO.</p><p>Must have, she reiterated silently as she parked the car.</p><p>So why hadn\u2019t she grabbed an invitation before heading toward the mail slot in his door? And why was she veering away from that door toward the master-bedroom side of Matthew\u2019s house?</p><p>Matthew never pulled the bedroom blinds. The neighbors\u2019 windows faced the other way, and it would take a slender voyeur indeed to traverse the narrow path. And a tall one to peer inside.</p><p>Elizabeth was slender, and tall. In the seconds before she witnessed the scene within, she knew what she\u2019d see. And, in those seconds, the prosecutor known for her ability to distill seemingly random details into a coherent story distilled what she was about to witness into a single word.</p><p>Lies.</p><p>Elizabeth had never cast herself in such a drama. It would have been an idle exercise\u2014and the attorney who hadn\u2019t spent a carefree summer since age eighteen was rarely idle. Besides, she\u2019d met enough criminals and their victims to know that imagined reactions to hypothetical situations didn\u2019t necessarily forecast what would happen when the situation was real.</p><p>At the moment, the reality was excruciating. A glimpse through the window was all she needed.</p><p>And her reaction to the betrayal?</p><p>She felt detached.</p><p>And purposeful.</p><p>She returned to her car, opened the trunk and extracted one of the just-minted invitations\u2014already of historical interest.</p><p>She toyed with writing \u201ccanceled\u201d across the gold engraving. Or, and this was more appealing, drawing a circle with a slash through it.</p><p>That had a certain eloquence, succinct yet clear.</p><p>Less, however, was more.</p><p>After emptying an envelope of its invitation, she dropped her engagement ring inside and sealed the flap.</p><p>Very haiku, she thought as she slipped the envelope through the slot in the door.</p><p>Then, numbly but decisively, she began the seven-and-a half-hour drive to her grandmother\u2019s home.</p><p>Two</p><p>Sarah\u2019s Orchard</p><p>Friday, July 7, 8:00 p.m.</p><p>Nick paused at the foot of the steep driveway he knew so well. It was a reverent pause; it was also a chance to assert mind over matter.</p><p>His legs hurt, an acute pain on top of the smoldering discomfort that was always there. He\u2019d been pushing hard the past three weeks, determined to complete the Tolliver Farm remodel today\u2014so he could get going on the summer\u2019s project for Clara in the morning.</p><p>His legs weren\u2019t happy. But he was. And the Tollivers were.</p><p>He\u2019d almost driven the mile from his home to Clara\u2019s. A concession to the throbbing in his legs. But the walk was good for his soul. Especially this final climb.</p><p>He\u2019d made it countless times since his return to Sarah\u2019s Orchard. As he made the ascent now, he recalled the evening, three Aprils earlier, when he\u2019d first knocked on the MacKenzies\u2019 teal-colored door.</p><p>He\u2019d been in Sarah\u2019s Orchard for six weeks by then, his decision to come back an easy one to make. Sarah\u2019s Orchard was the only place he\u2019d ever lived where he\u2019d choose to live again.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with the other towns he\u2019d lived in with his mother and Dennis, and Marianne\u2019s next boyfriend, and the next and the next\u2014until, when he was seventeen, they\u2019d gone their separate ways. Marianne had been ready to move. Again. He\u2019d wanted to finish school. He\u2019d never searched for her. Nor, he supposed, had she looked for him.</p><p>The towns had been pleasant. The memories weren\u2019t.</p><p>Nick hoped to live a quiet life for the rest of his life, and a useful one. As a soldier, he\u2019d volunteered for impossible missions\u2014and proved them possible, after all.</p><p>The military had been a good place for Nick until a spray of bullets fractured his legs and shattered his pelvis. He would\u2019ve continued to serve if he could. But his recovery, though surprising to the doctors, was incomplete. His strength wasn\u2019t what it had been, nor was he as agile as he needed to be.</p><p>The military didn\u2019t compel Lieutenant Commander Nicholas Lawton to leave. Quite the contrary. Any number of high-level noncombat positions were his for the taking.</p><p>But Nick couldn\u2019t send soldiers into battle unless he was with them, leading them in\u2014and leading them out.</p><p>He knew that emotional guidance was especially important for those unaccustomed to battle. No matter how well trained they were, how prepared they believed themselves to be, the first death, the first killing, was a shock.</p><p>No preparation was adequate for the sights and sounds of friends dying. Or enemies dying\u2014young men who, in another world, might have been friends. Men who, like them, dreamed of playing with their children, caring for their elderly parents, making love to their brides.</p><p>Emotions were kept at bay during the fighting itself. Adrenaline and training saw the soldiers through. But until the aftermath, no soldier knew how he\u2019d respond to what he\u2019d experienced. Some were able to articulate their feelings. Nick listened to what they needed to say.</p><p>Others, like Nick himself had been, held everything inside. Nick was there for them, too, listening to their silence and speaking words that might have been of comfort had someone spoken them to him.</p><p>Nick had left the military, honorably and with fanfare he hadn\u2019t wanted. What lay ahead, after months of rehab, was a mission as challenging as any he\u2019d ever known...and in which he was likely to fail.</p><p>Finding contentment, finding peace, might very well be impossible. Even in the only town he\u2019d ever wanted to live in.</p><p>He\u2019d chalked it up to morbid curiosity when he\u2019d driven by the house on Center Street. He remembered it as dilapidated and menacing\u2014where the danger to a seven-year-old boy was far greater than freezing to death on a winter night. The real peril had been to his heart and soul.</p><p>The house, with its For Rent sign, had remained an eyesore, a blemish in a neighborhood of charming homes. But it looked sad, not menacing, in need of care. The current owners, who lived in Medford, were waiting for the Sarah\u2019s Orchard housing market to appreciate enough that even their run-down property would sell. Their new tenant was welcome to make improvements, if he liked, at his own expense, assuming the structure wasn\u2019t devalued as a result. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t, and Nick\u2019s neighbors were thrilled. By the time he began knocking on doors\u2014for that was how introductions were made in Sarah\u2019s Orchard\u2014they\u2019d spread the word that the new handyman in town was handy indeed.</p><p>Nick\u2019s reconciliation with his Center Street memories helped his quest for peace. As did seeing the orchards again, one orchard in particular.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t enough. He needed to see the MacKenzies again. The kind eyes. He wouldn\u2019t introduce himself as \u201cthe boy who\u2019d saved Elizabeth,\u201d of course. Much less as \u201cElizabeth\u2019s hero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHero\u201d had been as foreign to him on that long-ago December night as \u201cson\u201d had been. He\u2019d clung to \u201cson,\u201d treasured it, but even at age seven he\u2019d believed \u201chero\u201d was wrong. He\u2019d only done what anyone would\u2019ve done had they spotted the sobbing little girl.</p> <p>He\u2019d been called a hero many times in the intervening years. It continued to sound wrong. In combat as in life, he only did what he believed anyone would do.</p><p>Nick had intended to tell Charles and Clara the same thing he\u2019d told the other townspeople who\u2019d opened their doors to him. He was willing and able to do a range of repairs.</p><p>The orchard was in blossom on the April evening the soldier with splintered bones climbed the steep drive the small boy had ascended, carrying a giggling toddler, so many Decembers past.</p><p>In blossom, and magical. Those trees, he felt, wanted him to sing to them, the way he sang \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d when that was what the wounded needed to hear. Or \u201cBattle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d Or \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d Or any song that would make an injured soldier smile.</p><p>It was Clara who\u2019d opened the door to his knock. Nick had been only a sentence into his introduction when she\u2019d tilted her head and widened her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur boy. Elizabeth\u2019s hero. Don\u2019t deny it. I know you are. Charles! Guess who\u2019s here? At last.\u201d</p><p>Nick hadn\u2019t denied it. Nor, by the time Charles appeared, had he confirmed it. He\u2019d been speechless in those moments, stunned that Clara had known.</p><p>The man he\u2019d become bore no resemblance to the scrawny boy he\u2019d been. True, Clara had promised she\u2019d never forget his bright blue eyes.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t have bright blue eyes, not as a boy\u2014and most certainly not as a man. Oh, there was a tincture of blue in the gray, a patch of sky amid the clouds. But in all his years, only Clara MacKenzie had remarked on it.</p> <p>What she\u2019d seen had been an illusion, the play of red Christmas lights on the hint of blue. Or maybe the entire illusion had been in the sparkling eyes of the beholder.</p><p>Others had made comments about Nick\u2019s eyes. Other women. Bedroom eyes, some concluded. Only wilder. As if a bed was too tame for his tastes. And that was before he went to war.</p><p>No, Nick didn\u2019t have bright blue eyes. Never had. And the hair that had been blondish when Clara had last seen him had turned brown when he reached his teens.</p><p>But Clara had known who he was.</p><p>Because of his expression, she\u2019d eventually informed him. It was identical, she said, to the hopeful way he\u2019d looked when she and Charles had promised to be there for him\u2014always. Hopeful yet skeptical, she\u2019d added. Hope against hope.</p><p>Charles and Clara MacKenzie had kept their promise, welcoming him into their lives when he\u2019d needed them most. Charles and Clara had needed Nick, too. Both of them. And, in the seven months since Charles\u2019s death, and to the extent she\u2019d permit it, he\u2019d shared with Clara her enormous loss.</p><p>Beginning tomorrow, he\u2019d be with Clara all summer.</p><p>He\u2019d find a way to help her, and the lovely eyes that had once seen colors and emotions no one else could see.</p> <p>Three</p><p>\u201cOh, Clara,\u201d he said when she opened the door and he saw her tears.</p><p>\u201cYou miss him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAll day, every day. Charles was the finest man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>Clara nodded and wiped her eyes. \u201cAre you dropping by for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust dropping by.\u201d Nick smiled. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t turn down food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come on in.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d both known she\u2019d ask, and that he\u2019d accept the offer. He\u2019d shown up often\u2014at suppertime\u2014since Charles\u2019s death. And at dawn, when her curtains signaled she\u2019d awakened for the day. And midmorning for coffee, and in the afternoon for tea.</p><p>Both knew he was checking up on her, and why he never called in advance. She\u2019d tell him what she told everyone else who worried about her. You don\u2019t need to come over. I\u2019m fine!</p><p>She\u2019d made such assertions to Nick in the beginning.</p><p>You can\u2019t possibly be fine, he\u2019d tell her when he appeared despite her protestations. He\u2019d arrive within fifteen minutes of his phone call, and she always seemed relieved when he did. And even if you\u2019re fine, Clara, I\u2019m not.</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t care about the food she inevitably served him. He could cook his own meals. But if he permitted Clara to feed him, she\u2019d end up nibbling on something, too.</p><p>It was past her usual suppertime. But Nick had the feeling she might have forgotten to eat. His impression was confirmed when they reached the kitchen.</p><p>On the table where her dinner might have been, four round boxes sat instead. Glossy boxes, he noted, each in a different shade of yellow.</p><p>\u201cHatboxes?\u201d Nick prompted.</p><p>\u201cThey contain the letters Charles wrote me during the war. I haven\u2019t read them since his return. I didn\u2019t need to. I had him. And,\u201d Clara said, \u201cI knew every one by heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you still do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Getting them down from the attic is as far as I\u2019ve gotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe attic? Clara\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m perfectly ambulatory, Nick! And the railings a certain dear friend of ours added to all our walls and staircases make climbing up and down a breeze.\u201d Clara smiled at the dear friend who, following Charles\u2019s stroke, had made it easy for him to spend the remaining year of his life with the woman he loved in the farmhouse he\u2019d always known. \u201cElizabeth painted these boxes for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Nick asked, moving closer.</p><p>The varying shades of yellow were background. On each lid was an apple tree. One for every season. The style was primitive and bold, painted by a girl who couldn\u2019t draw any better than she could sing.</p><p>The boxes weren\u2019t works of art. But they were works of love. And passion, Nick thought. An exuberant affection for the trees, be they barren for winter, blossom-laden during spring, bountiful with summer fruit or brilliant with the leaves of autumn.</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s wintertime tree wasn\u2019t entirely barren. Oblong splashes of red dangled from its outermost reaches. Christmas lights\u2014like the ones that had illuminated a sobbing little girl.</p><p>\u201cWhen did she paint these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first year she spent the entire summer here. She was eight, and we had such fun. On rainy days, we poked around in the attic, trying on old clothes, looking at old photographs, playing with the mah-jongg set Charles inherited from his father. Charles\u2019s letters didn\u2019t pique her interest. But she could tell how important they were to me. She wondered if they needed brighter homes than the white hatboxes I\u2019d stored them in. They definitely did, I told her, and asked if she\u2019d be willing to decorate them for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you suggest what she should draw? The seasons of the orchard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made no suggestions whatsoever. But, being Elizabeth, she shared her every thought. The boxes had to be yellow, she said, because I\u2019d painted the house yellow to welcome Charles home from the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t go with the same yellow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She felt it would be all right\u2014if I agreed\u2014to pick four brighter shades. You remember her affinity for the bright and shiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Nick said softly. \u201cAnd the apple trees? Why did she choose to paint them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she loves them. She\u2019s always viewed them as the living things they are\u2014as friends.\u201d Clara touched an apple blossom on Elizabeth\u2019s springtime tree. \u201cWhen she was finished, Charles lacquered each box inside and out, sealing the cardboard and, or so we hoped, preserving her vivid paintings. But they\u2019ve faded, haven\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Not at all, Nick thought. He felt quite sure they were as bright as the day eight-year-old Elizabeth had dabbed her final drop of paint. But Clara couldn\u2019t see it. It was the worry he would find a way to address. Beginning tomorrow.</p><p>Tonight, he broached the worry that was foremost on Clara\u2019s mind. \u201cHave you heard from Elizabeth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since Monday night. I don\u2019t expect to hear from her, Nick. Not on that topic. She\u2019s not mad at me because of what I said about Matthew. Sad, maybe. Disappointed. But not mad.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIf anyone owes anyone a follow-up phone call, it\u2019s me who should call her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be fair unless I was calling to tell her I\u2019d decided my instincts were wrong and he was perfect for her after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t decided that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. The more I think about it, the more convinced I become. It\u2019s better just to let some time pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Elizabeth still coming for a visit at the end of the month?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss it Monday night, but I\u2019m sure she will. She\u2019s not going to hold my concerns about Matthew against me. And she is going to marry him. I wasn\u2019t trying to talk her out of it. I probably shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your style, Clara, not when the happiness of your family\u2019s involved. Especially Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve made her unhappy. I wish you\u2019d come to the party at the Orchard Inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was behind on the remodel for Pete and Celia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were afraid I\u2019d have a glass of champagne or two, and start reminiscing about Elizabeth\u2019s Christmastime adventure and say this is the boy who saved her. This is Elizabeth\u2019s hero.\u201d</p><p>Clara had made the pronouncement with fondness twenty-seven years ago. There was more fondness now.</p><p>\u201cI was behind on the remodel,\u201d Nick repeated, smiling. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of your introducing me as that boy. I just don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Nick. And I won\u2019t. I do wish you\u2019d been at the party, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Elizabeth, Clara. There\u2019s no way I would\u2019ve been able to tell if she and Matthew were right for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have been able to tell. You\u2019d have been able to see...\u201d Clara sighed again.</p><p>\u201cSee what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Matthew\u2019s not in love with my granddaughter. There,\u201d she continued without a pause. \u201cI\u2019ve said what I could never say to Elizabeth. But it\u2019s what I believe, Nick. And it scares me for her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick hadn\u2019t had a chance to reflect upon, much less dispute, Clara\u2019s assertion that he\u2019d be able to see\u2014or even sense\u2014the presence or absence of love. But he heard himself say something astonishing. \u201cIt scares me for her, too.\u201d</p><p>Four</p><p>In what should have been the final hour of Elizabeth\u2019s seven-and-a-half-hour journey to Sarah\u2019s Orchard, the drive became treacherous. The two-lane road from Medford was somewhat perilous in broad daylight when the pavement was dry. But in darkness, when rain fell...</p><p>Eight hours and forty-five minutes after she\u2019d pulled away from the curb in San Francisco, Elizabeth reached the crest of a driveway down which\u2014or so she\u2019d been told\u2014she\u2019d scampered on a long-ago winter night.</p> <p>It was almost ten. Would Gram be awake?</p><p>The glowing house lights told her yes.</p><p>The lights were blurry. The rain was drenching. The downpour was not, however, the only reason for the watery blur.</p><p>Since her glimpse into Matthew\u2019s bedroom, Elizabeth had kept her emotions as tightly sequestered as a deliberating jury in a high-profile trial. But as she neared the safe haven of her grandmother\u2019s home, those emotions escaped in a flood of tears.</p><p>\u201cNow who could that be?\u201d Clara wondered when the doorbell rang.</p> <p>\u201cNo one you want to see,\u201d Nick replied. \u201cNot at this hour.\u201d</p><p>Nick had personally installed the farmhouse\u2019s burglar alarm. It was state-of-the-art\u2014every window, all the doors, panic buttons at various locations throughout the home. He had an uneasy feeling that Clara hadn\u2019t turned it on since Charles\u2019s death.</p><p>Now, at 10:00 p.m., she had no qualms about opening the door to whoever happened by on what had become a soggy night.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come over this late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without a warning call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Sarah\u2019s Orchard, Nick.\u201d She stood up from the kitchen table and gave Nick, who was washing dishes, a gentle pat. \u201cI\u2019ll scream if it\u2019s anyone sinister.\u201d</p> <p>Nick wiped his soapy hands and followed. He stopped short of the door and off to the side, invisible to the visitor, but a step away from intervening if Clara needed him.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Gram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome in, darling girl.\u201d The hand that had patted Nick\u2019s arm went to her granddaughter\u2019s cheek. \u201cTears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rain.\u201d Elizabeth lifted the rain-spattered box she\u2019d taken from the trunk before dashing to the covered porch. \u201cLots of rain. Not that it matters if these get soaked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Clara asked as Elizabeth walked inside.</p><p>\u201cMy wedding invitations. I thought we could build a fire with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe design didn\u2019t work out as well as you\u2019d hoped?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe design\u2019s fine. It\u2019s the wedding that\u2019s not so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know, Gram? About Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was supposed to be in New York, on the business trip he told you about last weekend. I went to his house, to leave one of the invitations for him. He wasn\u2019t in New York. And he wasn\u2019t alone. He was with the woman he\u2019d been involved with before he and I got together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he still alive?\u201d Nick stepped into her line of sight as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d You. Whoever you are.</p><p>She\u2019d seen him twice, briefly\u2014but memorably. The first time had been eighteen months ago, in the neurology ward at the Keeling Clinic, the day Granddad was admitted with his stroke. He\u2019d been standing at the periphery of the crowded waiting room of friends who\u2019d remained at the medical center until Clara\u2019s family arrived. He\u2019d disappeared shortly thereafter. But in the few moments before he\u2019d vanished, and even though her focus had been on rushing to Gram\u2019s side, she\u2019d been acutely aware of him.</p><p>It felt as if he, too, was at Clara\u2019s side. Despite how far away he stood. At Gram\u2019s side, protecting her\u2014and Granddad. Guarding them with his life.</p><p>The second time she\u2019d seen him had been seven months ago, in late November, at Granddad\u2019s funeral. He\u2019d stood a distance away then, as well.</p><p>Now he was here. Whoever he was. And he was asking if Matthew Blaine had survived his faithlessness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nicholas Lawton.\u201d</p><p>This\u2014he\u2014was Nicholas Lawton? Elizabeth knew of him, of course. Three years ago, he\u2019d been the talk, and worry, of the MacKenzie clan. Granddad had been wanting to remodel Gram\u2019s kitchen. Her \u201csmall\u201d business, The Apple Butter Ladies, was becoming a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Clara and her friend and business partner, Eve, needed more space not only for the batches of apple butter the marketplace was beginning to demand, but for the support staff that processed orders, packaged the jars, unloaded the crates of apples delivered from nearby orchards, and shipped off the cartons of apple butter.</p><p>Granddad knew what the new kitchen needed to be. His years as owner and manager of MacKenzie\u2019s Market had made him a wizard at designing flow patterns conducive to happy shoppers. And workers. His sketches for Clara\u2019s new kitchen were based on sitting in the midst of the Apple Butter Ladies\u2019 operation during its busiest time of year\u2014from harvest through the holidays. He\u2019d observed the near-collisions, the conversations that took place over shoulders, not face-to-face, and other obstacles to what should have been as enjoyable and productive as a quilting bee.</p><p>The changes were major. Walls would have to be moved. The bids he\u2019d gotten had been pricier than he\u2019d imagined. But the cost hadn\u2019t been the primary sticking point. The contractors didn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d his vision. They\u2019d suggested modifications Charles had known wouldn\u2019t work. The idea of spending hard-earned money for the privilege of arguing over the placement of every cupboard and countertop wasn\u2019t something Charles was eager to do.</p><p>He would, though, if he had to. For Clara.</p><p>He was on the verge of accepting a bid when, out of the blue, a man named Nicholas Lawton arrived in town. A \u201chandyman,\u201d Charles reported to his family. Who, he assured his concerned children\u2014and grandchildren\u2014was fully capable of handling the entire renovation. \u201cNick can do anything,\u201d Clara cheerfully added...which alarmed the family all the more. Who was this stranger who\u2019d bewitched Gram and Granddad so completely?</p><p>Two of Elizabeth\u2019s six cousins, all of whom were male, made an immediate surprise visit to the farmhouse. No one was going to take advantage of their grandparents.</p><p>But they\u2019d liked Nick. Proclaimed him to be a \u201cgreat guy.\u201d The assessment was affirmed within months by two additional cousins and, over time, by the entire family. Not that everyone met Nick. But they saw Gram\u2019s kitchen and, after Granddad\u2019s stroke, the railings Nick installed.</p><p>They heard, too, the affection for Nick in their grandparents\u2019 voices. Gram\u2019s fondness was easy and familiar. Her emotions were always effortlessly conveyed. With the exception of his family, however, Granddad had been reserved. But there was emotion in Charles\u2019s voice when he talked about Nick. It was different from what one heard for his sons and grandsons. But no less important, or impassioned.</p><p>Like the rest of her family, Elizabeth spoke highly of Nicholas Lawton, and was grateful for Nicholas Lawton, although\u2014as it happened\u2014every time she was in town, he was involved with projects elsewhere and unable to drop by.</p><p>She\u2019d be meeting him this summer, Gram had said. At the farmhouse. Assuming, of course, that Nick hadn\u2019t finished the painting he planned to do before Elizabeth\u2019s visit in late July.</p><p>Elizabeth knew very little about painting houses. But she felt certain she and Nick would meet. Ten years ago, when then-mayor Clara MacKenzie decided the \u201cmayorly\u201d thing to do in honor of Sarah\u2019s Orchard\u2019s centennial celebration would be to return James and Sarah Keeling\u2019s farmhouse to its original teal and white, the painters Granddad hired were at it for three months.</p><p>There\u2019d been a team of painters then, not a solitary one. And their task, to cover cream with teal, had to be far easier than what Nick would face when he did the reverse, restoring Charles and Clara\u2019s farmhouse to the colors it had been ever since it had served as a beacon to welcome a soldier home.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to paint the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside and out,\u201d Clara said.</p><p>\u201cInside, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Nick asked.</p><p>\u201cIt needs to be spiffed up, Nick says, all except the kitchen. We\u2019ve been discussing color schemes,\u201d Clara murmured, \u201cNick has all sorts of options and he wants me to decide. He says he\u2019s showing up at dawn tomorrow with a zillion paint chips. I can\u2019t make such decisions. Now that you\u2019re here, Elizabeth, I won\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want me choosing colors!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. But\u2014and here\u2019s what I was going to do\u2014just agree with whatever Nick thinks will look best. He\u2019s the artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly,\u201d Nick said. \u201cI look forward to your input, Elizabeth.\u201d He untied the daisy-print apron he wore. \u201cNow, I think I\u2019ll leave you ladies alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take my car?\u201d Clara asked. \u201cIt\u2019s pouring.\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t glance outside. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d He looked at Elizabeth. \u201cWhat time\u2019s good for you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime. Including dawn. Wasn\u2019t that what you and Gram had planned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly,\u201d Clara said, \u201cbecause Nick knows I\u2019m an early riser when I don\u2019t have my granddaughter to chat with through the night. We should be up by noon, though, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say so,\u201d Elizabeth replied. \u201cI\u2019d also say I\u2019ve never slept past eight in my life, Gram, and neither have you. So if you\u2019d like to come by earlier, Nick...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoon\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201d</p><p>The downpour was a suitable companion for Nick\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>As he left the farmhouse, he headed away from Center Street, not toward it. He needed to walk for a while. Run for a while.</p><p>And think\u2014for a while.</p><p>Clara and Charles hadn\u2019t forgotten the boy who\u2019d rescued their granddaughter. And Elizabeth\u2019s vanishing act in pursuit of brightly lit apple trees was a cautionary tale remembered by every MacKenzie old enough to recall the terror of that evening.</p><p>All MacKenzies knew that a nameless youngster had carried their girl to safety. But Charles and Clara alone had been waiting for his return. They\u2019d seemed to know he would return, and even when, since the kitchen Charles had designed for Clara was ready for Nick to build.</p><p>Nick had always known that the rescued girl would have no memory of her Yuletide misadventure. Much less of him.</p><p>Nick wouldn\u2019t have recognized Elizabeth, either, if he hadn\u2019t seen photographs of her in her grandparents\u2019 home. Despite that, the Elizabeth who rushed into the Keeling Clinic on the evening of Charles\u2019s stroke had been a surprise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The camera had captured her elegant bones and wholesome allure. But it had failed to capture her. She didn\u2019t have a freeze-frame sort of face. Or a freeze-frame sort of life. She was beauty in motion, as vibrant as the bright colors she chased. As bold as the emotions it wouldn\u2019t occur to her to hide.</p><p>Until that evening at the clinic, Nick figured it was just a matter of time before he and Elizabeth were introduced. The well-bred heiress would offer a gracious hello, while the granddaughter-turned-prosecutor searched for proof that he meant no harm to the grandparents she loved.</p><p>He\u2019d pass inspection, and that would be that. From her standpoint, anyway.</p><p>Nick had known, even before seeing her, that the protectiveness he felt toward Charles and Clara would extend to their only granddaughter.</p> <p>It did, but with a twist.</p><p>Elizabeth needed his protection, all right. Protection from him.</p><p>The attraction he\u2019d felt for her was immediate. And powerful.</p><p>But as powerful as the physical desire was, it paled in comparison to a longing that was entirely new. He wanted to be with her. Simply be. For better, for worse. In sickness and in health. Forsaking all others.</p><p>Forever.</p> <p>Nick dealt with his longing in a way that was best for Elizabeth, most protective of her. He kept his distance, avoiding any and all opportunity for the two of them to even meet. And, on a sunny day in early May, Clara told him Elizabeth was engaged.</p><p>He ached at the revelation. And, at the same time, he felt relieved. Elizabeth had found the kind of man she should marry.</p><p>And now...</p><p>Now.</p><p>Nick could run all night in the storm. Until his every shattered bone screamed for mercy.</p><p>But Nicholas Lawton couldn\u2019t outrun, could never outrun, his feelings for Elizabeth.</p> <p>They were part of who he was.</p><p>The best part.</p><p>Five</p><p>Gram insisted that her rain-soaked granddaughter change into slumber-party attire before they convened in the kitchen for hot chocolate and a chat.</p><p>\u201cI will if you will,\u201d Elizabeth had said.</p><p>They\u2019d gone to their separate bedrooms, the one where Clara and Charles had slept for more than sixty years\u2014and where Charles had died in his sleep\u2014and the guest room down the hall that had always been Elizabeth\u2019s.</p><p>Her farm clothes were there, the wardrobe from the final teenage summer she\u2019d spent at Sarah\u2019s Orchard. The wardrobe had been baggy even then. She\u2019d liked wearing loose clothing over her plumpish frame.</p><p>The plumpness had gone the way of carefree summers. The jeans and T-shirts would be baggier now.</p> <p>When Gram, in robe and slippers, emerged from her bedroom, Elizabeth, similarly dressed, emerged from hers.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t what I expected,\u201d Elizabeth said as they walked down the stairs.</p><p>Gram\u2019s hand slid along the satin-smooth railing Nick had made. \u201cYou only dated him for four months before getting engaged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that my expectations mean very much. Witness Matthew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMatthew\u2019s history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s definitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth\u2019s mind\u2019s eye viewed again the image she\u2019d glimpsed through his bedroom window. \u201cYes. He is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s talk about Nick. In what way wasn\u2019t he what you expected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I thought he wouldn\u2019t be so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandsome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSolemn.\u201d Intense.</p><p>\u201cNick is solemn. He reminds me of Granddad in that way. In many ways, come to think of it.\u201d</p><p>Granddad? Solemn? And like Nick in many ways?</p><p>Elizabeth might have pursued the inquiry. They\u2019d reached the kitchen, where, on one of the many countertops Granddad knew the Apple Butter Ladies needed and which Nick had built, sat the hatboxes she\u2019d painted twenty-one years ago.</p><p>\u201cGranddad\u2019s letters,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes. Please feel free to read them.\u201d</p><p>To discover, Elizabeth mused, what true love really is. \u201cI couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to. In fact, I\u2019m hoping all our children and grandchildren will. They\u2019re a little mushy, I suppose, but there\u2019s nothing too private for you to read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll read them, Gram. We all will. If that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the reason I brought them down from the attic. I\u2019d like to make copies, a complete set for each of you\u2014and Nick, of course.\u201d</p><p>Nick, of course? \u201cThat would be wonderful,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cWe could even have them bound into books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Clara touched a glossy box. \u201cThat would be nice. There\u2019s a bit of organizing to do. The letters are in chronological order, but I carried some of them with me all the time. I\u2019m not sure I tucked them into their correct bundles when I received word that Charles was on his way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds easy,\u201d Elizabeth said. So easy she wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it if not for Gram\u2019s frown. \u201cGram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be willing to put them in order for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be delighted to. But wouldn\u2019t you like to do that yourself? And read them again while you\u2019re at it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to read them yet. So if you wouldn\u2019t mind...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I\u2019d be delighted. Gram? Is there something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid they may not photocopy very well. The paper was thin to begin with, and he wrote on both sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. You\u2019d be amazed at the smudged, machine-washed, written-on-both-sides bits of paper I\u2019ve been able to present to juries in all their legible glory, thanks to the magic of computers. That\u2019s what we should do, Gram. Scan the letters directly into your computer. We can tinker with contrast, resolution and so on at the scanning stage, and make additional improvements once we\u2019ve scanned them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re saying \u2018we.\u2019 When it comes to computers, my forte is e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still frowning. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking it\u2019s been a while since I e-mailed Winifred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike before meeting Matthew last weekend?\u201d Elizabeth guessed.</p><p>\u201cA while before that,\u201d Gram admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou were busy planning the reception for us at the Orchard Inn. It was a wonderful party, Gram, my unfortunate choice of fianc\u00e9 notwithstanding. If you\u2019d liked Matthew, you would\u2019ve e-mailed Winifred right away. But you didn\u2019t like him, and not wanting to worry her, you held off. And, of course, you were concerned about my feelings, too. The good news is you have a doozy of an e-mail to send now. With my permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t get too carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth is the truth, Gram. There are men who\u2019d never lie to their fianc\u00e9es, or spend clandestine afternoons with other women. Men like Granddad,\u201d Elizabeth said. And Nick? \u201cThen there are the Matthew Blaines of the world. He wasn\u2019t in love with me. You were able to see it, even though I couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw something else, Elizabeth. You weren\u2019t in love with Matthew, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just saying that to make me feel better.\u201d Elizabeth smiled. \u201cIt would make me feel better\u2014if it was true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, darling girl. Mark my\u2014Nick,\u201d she predicted as the phone began to ring.</p><p>\u201cNick? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll want to make sure there\u2019s nothing we need.\u201d Clara lifted the receiver. \u201cWe\u2019re fine! Hello? Well, yes, as a matter of fact, she is here.\u201d Your mother, she mouthed. \u201cSafe and sound, thank goodness, and having dodged an unfortunate matrimonial bullet. No, Abby, she\u2019s not going to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Clara winked at her granddaughter. Abigail MacKenzie-Winslow didn\u2019t like being called Abby. Her mother knew it, and reserved it for times such as these, when sternness was required.</p><p>\u201cThe engagement ring Matthew found in his foyer was a major clue. He\u2019s bewildered? I\u2019d suggest he put on his thinking cap. He\u2019s a smart fellow. He ought to be able to figure this out.\u201d Clara was silent for a moment. \u201cShe\u2019s resting. I\u2019ll have her call you tomorrow. She won\u2019t be changing her mind. And, as her mother, you shouldn\u2019t want her to.\u201d Another silence. \u201cI don\u2019t know when she\u2019ll be returning to San Francisco. I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll stay here for a while. She\u2019d be a tremendous help with a project I\u2019m working on. Give my best to Thomas, will you?\u201d</p><p>Clara replaced the receiver and smiled at her granddaughter.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Gram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the end of it,\u201d Clara said. \u201cWe both know your mother better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe really wanted this marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad! If Matthew\u2019s last name wasn\u2019t Blaine, and she wasn\u2019t in a tizzy about how her society friends are going to react, her focus would be where it belongs\u2014on you. Despite that, she is concerned about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow a daughter of mine could be such a snob, I\u2019ll never know.\u201d Gram paused. Sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s not entirely accurate. The truth is, she comes by it honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does? From where? Dad\u2019s not a snob. And she certainly didn\u2019t get it from you or Granddad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m afraid she did. Who knew snobbery could be carried in the genes? Old money isn\u2019t even supposed to be snobbish. Your father being a case in point. But, as I know well, it\u2019s the exception that proves the rule. One of San Francisco\u2019s oldest and wealthiest families\u2014mine\u2014is such an exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family, Gram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe San Francisco Carltons. Even when I was a girl, the Carlton fortune was generations old. But talk about snobs. My mother especially.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father was almost as pretentious. He was a Bronxville Smith. But we lived in San Francisco, not New York, and she was the Carlton of the two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you\u2019re a Carlton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a Carlton. Granddad knew, and his parents. To everyone else, I was simply Clara Anne Smith, who couldn\u2019t wait to become Clara Anne MacKenzie. It wasn\u2019t a secret as much as an irrelevance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom doesn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd never needs to. Like your relationship with Matthew, my pedigree is ancient history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did you and Granddad meet? I always thought he\u2019d never left Sarah\u2019s Orchard before he went to war\u2014and that the two of you met and fell in love before that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met here, in September 1941. I\u2019d just celebrated my sixteenth birthday and in two months he\u2019d turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a month after that,\u201d Elizabeth said, \u201cPearl Harbor was attacked.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe were in love by then. Long before that day of infamy, we knew we\u2019d spend our lives together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing in Sarah\u2019s Orchard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat all San Francisco heiresses did in those days, attending finishing school. Because of the war in Europe, stateside boarding schools were popular, and new ones kept cropping up. Rogue River School for Girls was in its second year when I arrived that September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Rogue River School for Girls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you know the building well. After the war, it became the Orchard Inn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is a short walk to MacKenzie\u2019s Market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere Granddad helped his parents on weekends and after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where a Rogue River schoolgirl happened by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA classmate and I loved the apples we were served at lunch. One day, we decided to buy some for snacks. One day became every day. Granddad always had an apple waiting for me, shined to a mirror finish on his shirtsleeve. His parents were amused by how smitten he was. Girls had been stopping by the store for apples\u2014or whatever else was in season\u2014for a while. But he\u2019d never taken an interest in any of them the way he was interested in me. And, of course, he was my one and only love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you were his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe knew it. His family knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d planned to tell them that Christmas. Charles and I talked about his coming to San Francisco for New Year\u2019s to ask my parents\u2019 permission for us to marry that spring. But everything changed, the world changed on December 7. I went to Portland with him. That\u2019s where he enlisted. And where we spoke our wedding vows\u2014privately, just to each other.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment. \u201cWe thought he\u2019d be sent to the Pacific. But Congress had declared war on Germany and Italy, too, by then, and that\u2019s where he went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long was he gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years, eight months, six days. He came home a month after VE Day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou missed him desperately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery second of every day. I was lucky to have his parents, and this town. They welcomed me and my babies, your twin uncles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your family?\u201d</p><p>Clara shook her head. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want any part of a daughter who\u2019d gotten pregnant out of wedlock with a country boy whose dream was to carry on the tradition of his family\u2019s store. My parents threatened to disown me, to cut me off from the wealth and social status that were my birthright, unless I went into hiding until after I\u2019d had my babies and given them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. And so was I. I didn\u2019t threaten to disown them. I just did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must\u2019ve been difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t pretend it wasn\u2019t. Not the decision\u2014that was easy. But it hurt me deeply that they hadn\u2019t even wanted to meet the man I loved, hadn\u2019t given him a chance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom\u2019s not that much of a snob. But,\u201d Elizabeth said, \u201cI wonder if Matthew is.\u201d</p><p>Six</p><p>April 13, 1942 Midnight</p><p>Clara, my love, I\u2019m remembering the first night you sneaked out of the dormitory to be with me. I was so worried you\u2019d fall as you climbed down the tree. You laughed at my worry. I can hear that fearless laughter even now. You scampered down the oak, long skirts and all, as if you\u2019d been climbing trees all your life. We walked to the river. Do you remember? And lay beside each other on the grass. We listened to the sounds of the autumn night. The owl talking to the moon. The river lapping at our feet. I listened to you breathe. When you breathed out, my Clara, I breathed in. I wanted to draw deep within me the air still warm from being deep within you. I wondered if you were doing the same. It was the only way we could touch on that September night. We\u2019d known each other just one week. We lay as close as we could without touching, didn\u2019t we? I wanted to touch you, Clara. You discovered, later, how much. But I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t touch on that night. I can lie here, so many miles away\u2014a world away, my darling\u2014and pretend you\u2019re beside me now, and that the night air that\u2019s giving me life, giving me hope, is doing so because it was breathed first by you. I love you, Clara. More than life, and long beyond death. I\u2019m lying beside you, my love. Always,</p><p>Charles \u201cOh, Granddad,\u201d Elizabeth whispered as she placed the letter beside the others she\u2019d read. \u201cGranddad.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, and through the blur of dampness in her eyes, she glanced at the stovetop clock.</p><p>Eleven forty-five. Time to get ready for Nick. Mentally ready, she amended, for the switching of cerebral gears from Granddad\u2019s letters, Granddad\u2019s love, to choosing colors schemes for the house\u2014with Nick.</p><p>Mental preparedness was required there, as well. She felt wary about seeing Nick. Quite wary. But quite eager, too.</p><p>It was an unsettling paradox, and a crazy one. Crazy being the operative word.</p><p>A little head-clearing fresh air was in order, and it was hers for the taking. Last night\u2019s rainstorm was now a memory. The world it left behind sparkled fresh and clean.</p><p>She walked the length of the driveway. At its farthest reach, she sat on a patch of grass beneath an apple tree. Eyes closed, she lifted her face skyward. The air was warm, as if from the lungs of a loved one lying close by. She inhaled deeply and was rewarded with a gift from an orchard of friends, the delicate scent of apples ripening beneath the summer sun.</p><p>Elizabeth Charlotte Winslow didn\u2019t have a freeze-frame kind of beauty; Nick had already decided that.</p><p>But the face that smiled at the sun was as motionless as a painting, and more beautiful than any he\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>She was sitting beneath the very tree where he\u2019d found her, sobbing, as a girl, and he was approaching from behind her, as he had on that December afternoon.</p><p>He would\u2019ve been happy to watch her forever. But she had no idea she was being observed, and he had no right not to tell her.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flew open and she scrambled to her feet.</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the lookout for Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I...\u201d On the lookout for you. \u201cGram said you\u2019d be coming from Center Street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came early. There\u2019s a fence rail that needs replacing. I wanted to check for others before making a run to the lumber store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take such good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored that she lets me.\u201d Nick gestured toward the hill up which he\u2019d once carried a singing, clinging little girl. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d They ascended in silence, except for the swishing sound of her jeans legs brushing against each other. Finally she said, \u201cMatthew won\u2019t be coming to Sarah\u2019s Orchard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s dead, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Then why isn\u2019t he moving heaven and earth to win you back? \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw...what I saw, I put my engagement ring in a wedding-invitation envelope, slid it through the mail slot in his door and drove away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice. Classy.\u201d His smile was solemn. But it was a smile. \u201cVery haiku.\u201d</p><p>She stopped. The denim stopped.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I thought it was very haiku, too. Are you a poet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a handyman, Elizabeth.\u201d Nick resumed walking. \u201cSo you think your haiku message will keep Matthew away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m hoping the conversation we had when he called last night will. I believe I made it clear that any further discussions would be a waste of his time\u2014and mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou meant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he wasn\u2019t happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was...surprised. He tried to convince me that what he\u2019d done had \u2018just happened,\u2019 as if he\u2019d had no more control over it than if he\u2019d been struck by lightning. And, of course, he said it meant nothing to him. Janine meant nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou obviously weren\u2019t convinced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I thought he was in love with Janine and should have the courage to marry her, no matter how his parents felt about it. That wasn\u2019t what he wanted to hear. He was still trying to persuade me to forgive him. I said I already had, but that the marriage was off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not questioning your decision. I\u2019m just wondering if you expanded on your reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did point out that lies don\u2019t \u2018just happen.\u2019 And that he\u2019d lied to me in advance about where he\u2019d be yesterday afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA premeditated lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetrayal in the first degree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d said that. Are you an attorney, Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m a handyman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho can do anything, according to Gram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do a few things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always been a handyman?\u201d</p><p>Not always, Nick thought. Not until a December afternoon. Before then, he\u2019d been a boy no one wanted, or valued.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t believed\u2014until then\u2014in a better world than the one he\u2019d always known. But there was a better world, he\u2019d discovered. And, just maybe, it was a world in which he could belong. He\u2019d vowed to try.</p><p>\u201cFrom the time I was seven, when I\u2019ve seen something that needed fixing, I\u2019ve done my best to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should\u2019ve tried to fix my relationship with Matthew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in a million years. Not even if you loved him.\u201d This time it was Nick who stopped. He waited until she met his dark gray eyes. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove the man I was going to marry? And whom I would have married if I hadn\u2019t caught him in flagrante with Janine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThat man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It began as a whisper, as if it were a confession almost too shameful to reveal. Once exposed to the summer sun\u2014or perhaps to the gray eyes that glittered with sparks of blue\u2014the no took on a life of its own. A happy life, relieved...and giggling. Bubbling. \u201cNo. No! I didn\u2019t love him.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Clara?\u201d Nick asked when they entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s at Eve\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemonade?\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cSure. Thank you.\u201d Tossing the folder he\u2019d brought with him onto the kitchen table, Nick walked to the counter where Charles\u2019s letters lay, taken from their glossy boxes. \u201cAre you reading these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Gram wants all of us to read them. All of us is her family...and you.\u201d It surprised him, Elizabeth thought. And moved him. He swallowed and looked away. \u201cAfter making copies, I\u2019m going to have each set professionally bound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Nick touched the stack that had been removed from their envelopes. \u201cAre these the ones you\u2019ve read so far?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Elizabeth nodded as she gave him a glass of lemonade. \u201cI put the envelopes in order first. That didn\u2019t take as long as Gram figured it might. Then I started reading. The letters begin the day Granddad said goodbye to her in Portland. He introduces each fellow soldier he meets like an author introduces the characters in his story\u2014who each of them is, where he comes from, who he loves, who and what he left behind. It\u2019s a diverse group, but they\u2019re united in their commitment to what they\u2019ve chosen to do. Granddad doesn\u2019t portray their journey as a grand adventure. And yet, as they\u2019re crossing the country\u2014and then the ocean\u2014it feels that way. There\u2019s a sense of excitement, of eagerness for what lies ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think they know what lies ahead?\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth shook her head. \u201cHow could they? They\u2019re only eighteen. And, like Granddad, they\u2019ve enlisted because of Pearl Harbor. The country they love has been attacked. They want to defend it. They believe what they\u2019re doing is right and good. And because it is right and good, they also believe they\u2019ll return triumphant and whole. But they can\u2019t, can they? Not all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick said. \u201cNot all of them. In the letters you\u2019ve read, have they gone into battle yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Just. And they all survived. Granddad says it that succinctly, that flatly, without any description of what actually happened.\u201d Elizabeth handed him the letter Charles wrote at midnight on April 13, 1942. \u201cA few hours later, he wrote this.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s expression as he read revealed nothing. When he finished and looked at her, his eyes were the color of stone. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the letter? That it\u2019s beautiful. He loves Gram so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does.\u201d Nick hesitated briefly. \u201cI\u2019m sensing you have other thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get the feeling something horrible happened. He needs to tell her what it was.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t. Ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll tell her succinctly, flatly, when one of his band of brothers dies. But he\u2019ll never describe how his friends die, or the way it feels to aim a rifle at another human being and pull the trigger and watch him fall, or how frightened he is, or angry, or if there comes a time when he wishes he could take a bullet instead of firing one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has to tell her those things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the woman he loves! The woman who loves him. He can\u2019t hide such important emotions from her. It would be wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was so clear to her. How could it not be to him? But it obviously wasn\u2019t. A new darkness shadowed his eyes. It looked like sadness, she thought. Loneliness. He didn\u2019t agree with what she was saying. And yet, it seemed, he wasn\u2019t going to argue the point. Maybe, if she quit arguing, he\u2019d explain. \u201cWhy would he hide what he was feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he loves her. He wants to protect her, Elizabeth. Her\u2014and them. The love they share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying he did something in combat that would make her love him less\u2014or stop loving him at all? Because if so, I don\u2019t believe it. Granddad would never, ever, have committed the kind of atrocity that...Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have. He\u2019d have died first. You know that. I know that. And he trusts that your grandmother will know it, too. War can\u2019t change a man like Charles MacKenzie, Elizabeth. Not even war can do that.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth heard in Nick\u2019s voice the same emotion she\u2019d heard in Granddad\u2019s when he spoke of Nick. She couldn\u2019t define it. But it was solemn. Important. And very deep. Gram had said the two were alike. And close, Elizabeth realized. Bonded in some special\u2014reverent\u2014way. Maybe Granddad had told Nick about the letters, what he\u2019d shared and hadn\u2019t shared with Clara...and why. Or maybe Nick was only guessing.</p><p>Either way, Nick seemed to know.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find any premeditated betrayal here.\u201d</p> <p>Nick gestured toward the letters as he spoke. Here referred, of course, to what Charles had written to his love. And yet, for a crazy unsettling moment, it felt as if here\u2014where there was no betrayal\u2014was anyplace she happened to be. With Nick.</p><p>\u201cNo betrayal,\u201d she murmured. \u201cBut you said Granddad wants to protect Gram. And them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs to believe that the world he knew before he went to war still exists. That\u2019s the world he\u2019s fighting for, where a girl climbs down a tree to meet the boy she loves, and you don\u2019t have to strain to hear an owl above the sounds of mortar and the cries of wounded men. That\u2019s why he\u2019s fighting, Elizabeth, to protect that innocence, that ideal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when he writes about Gram being beside him, he\u2019s not bringing her to war with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick said softly, \u201che\u2019s going home.\u201d</p><p>Home felt like here. Crazy. Except, in his blue-gray eyes, the sadness\u2014and the loneliness\u2014were gone.</p><p>What filled the void was so unsettling, in a giddy, glorious way, that she turned from him...and started babbling.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should look at your color schemes. Not that I\u2019m going to make any suggestions. In fact, don\u2019t let me. I\u2019d never have come up with the choices you made for Gram\u2019s kitchen, and they\u2019re wonderful...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to love these.\u201d Elizabeth\u2019s assertion, made thirty minutes later, was a grateful one. \u201cThe colors you\u2019ve chosen are so cheerful. Just walking from room to room will make her smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Nick said. \u201cAssuming she can see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s having trouble with her vision?\u201d Elizabeth frowned. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure she would, even if she knew.\u201d</p><p>He was right, of course. Gram wasn\u2019t one to complain. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s aware that her vision isn\u2019t what it used to be. But if it\u2019s what I think it is\u2014cataracts\u2014the impairment has come on so gradually she\u2019s adapted to the changes without realizing how significant they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you think they\u2019re significant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery, and probably have been for a while. But because she has adapted, it\u2019s only been three weeks since I first began to wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you wonder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of what happened when she looked at the sky on a crystal-clear night. She grabbed my arm and pointed to the moon. She was alarmed by what she saw, didn\u2019t know what it was. I thought she was confused. But as I was deciding how to suggest that to her, she began to describe what she was seeing. An immense sphere of light, she said, bright and glaring. A UFO, she thought, and was stunned I wasn\u2019t remarking on it, too. When I told her all I saw was the moon, she tilted her head, changing the angle of the incoming light and, with a laugh, chalked it up to her eyes playing tricks on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did a little reading online and began to notice other things. Her reaction to oncoming headlights, for instance. She squints at them and, sometimes, she even recoils.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think she drove at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t, and hasn\u2019t for a while. But she\u2019s been a passenger in my truck. I\u2019ve made a point of being a passenger in her car, too, during the day. She\u2019s okay if the ambient light is good and it\u2019s a familiar route. She\u2019s a careful driver. Cautious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if her overall vision is significantly impaired...What else have you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t read the way she used to. Not for pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr,\u201d Elizabeth said, \u201cmaintain what was once a daily e-mail correspondence with Winifred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s after increasing the magnification of her reading glasses to the strongest she can buy at the market. She listens to the radio, and listens to, but doesn\u2019t watch, TV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said she might not see the colors you\u2019ve chosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure she sees color at all anymore. When she showed me the hatboxes you painted, she was dismayed that they\u2019d faded despite the lacquer finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t faded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth searched her memory for what else she\u2019d observed since her arrival. \u201cShe uses the railing to go up and down stairs. And she was very eager to turn the letter-scanning project over to me. And equally eager not to be here when you showed me the color schemes. And last night, while we were sitting at the kitchen table, she got up a couple of times to flip a light switch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to discover the light was already on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the lights were on. The kitchen was bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer world may be very dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA visual darkness,\u201d Elizabeth said thoughtfully, \u201cthat makes sense to her, feels appropriate to her, given the emotional darkness of losing Granddad. Not being able to see must make that loss, and the prospect of her life after Granddad, seem even more hopeless. But it was her idea, she said, to have you paint the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gold that guided Granddad home after the war. She wants him to see the glow from wherever he is\u2014even though she can\u2019t.\u201d Elizabeth saw a glow then. Or believed she did. A glitter of wanting, of longing, in his solemn gray eyes. In a flicker it was gone. Its impact left her momentarily confused. She forced the moment, and the confusion away. \u201cGram needs to see an ophthalmologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has an appointment for eleven on Wednesday morning. I made it once I figured out what was going on. I called Charles\u2019s neurologist at the Clinic and asked who he\u2019d recommend. Next Wednesday was the earliest opening, but the timing was good. I didn\u2019t want to talk to her about her vision until after you and Matthew had come and gone, and I knew that beginning today I\u2019d be here all the time. My plan was to show her the color schemes I\u2019d chosen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to gently, patiently, point out to her what she couldn\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. She knows her vision is failing. She just doesn\u2019t know there\u2019s a chance it can be improved. I\u2019m expecting resistance to the idea of seeing an ophthalmologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEye surgery is daunting, even for an intrepid climber of trees. She\u2019s been in such wonderful health all her life. As far as I know, she\u2019s never had surgery of any kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaunting,\u201d Nick agreed. \u201cAnd not without risk\u2014assuming my diagnosis is even correct.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth was certain it was, that his research had been thorough, his conclusions sound. And if she asked him whether he happened to be an ophthalmologist, she could predict his stern reply.</p><p>No, Elizabeth, I\u2019m a handyman.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just old,\u201d Gram said when Nick and Elizabeth raised the issue of her eyesight. \u201cI\u2019m just old.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not old, Gram, and once your vision\u2019s restored to what it can be, you\u2019ll be as active as ever. Not being able to see has gotten in your way. You would\u2019ve gone on the cruise to Victoria with Helen and Winifred, you know you would have, if you hadn\u2019t felt uncomfortable about making the trip from Sarah\u2019s Orchard to Seattle. The thought of trying to read signs in airports, and finding your way in unfamiliar places in what felt like darkness...don\u2019t you think that influenced your decision not to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Elizabeth. Since Granddad died, everything\u2019s been difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it has, Clara,\u201d Nick said. \u201cThe loss is immense. But that\u2019s all the more reason to fix what can be fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of you spent the afternoon rehearsing your pitch, didn\u2019t you? I feel like I\u2019m in the middle of one of those interventions.\u201d</p> <p>Elizabeth smiled. \u201cMaybe we rehearsed a little, Gram. Is it working? If not, we have reams of information downloaded from the Internet that we\u2019re prepared to read aloud to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dear things, both of you. And I\u2019m very grateful for your concern. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could at least have an ophthalmologist do an exam. Cataracts or not, having your eyes checked is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to have an exam unless I\u2019d be willing to have surgery if something was found. I\u2019m all right the way I am. I\u2019m getting along fine. I see the two of you quite well. And you\u2019re both gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust think how much more gorgeous we\u2019d be, Gram, not to mention how colorful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice try, Elizabeth. But it\u2019s really my decision, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntirely your decision,\u201d Nick said. \u201cJust promise us that you\u2019ll consider it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise. Now, can we please talk about something else?\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Nick announced he was going home to get a good night\u2019s rest before the painting project that would commence the following day.</p><p>Elizabeth walked him to the porch.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat she\u2019s her granddaughter\u2019s grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgumentative?\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled. \u201cDetermined. And smart. Like you, she\u2019s able to listen and argue at the same time. She heard every word we said, and she\u2019s going to give it some serious thought. Ultimately, though, it\u2019s her decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the man who likes to fix things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. But we can\u2019t make her do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd pushing her is likely to backfire.\u201d Elizabeth sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re probably thinking we shouldn\u2019t mention it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless she brings it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we don\u2019t tell her about the appointment you made.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>She admired the reasonableness of his approach. When she shook her head, it was with resignation, not protest. But her movement was forceful enough to dislodge a strand of auburn hair from where it belonged, behind her ear, into her eyes.</p><p>As she reached up to tuck it away, another hand moved to touch it\u2014touch her\u2014too.</p><p>Her hand was quicker. Impatient. She watched his hand, as if in slow motion, drop away.</p><p>By the time she looked up, it was too late to tell what expression had accompanied his gesture.</p><p>It was just as well, she told herself after they\u2019d said good-night. Gram\u2019s eyes were seeing too little, and hers were seeing too much.</p><p>Nick was a sensual man. He undoubtedly touched women, casually, all the time. And he was polite. Chivalrous. He\u2019d brush a lock of hair from a woman\u2019s eyes as reflexively as he\u2019d open a door for her.</p><p>She might have misinterpreted his expression as longing. And completely misunderstood his touch....</p><p>Eight</p><p>The sanding of teal-colored paint, to create a pastel canvas for the cream that would cover it, was hard work, hot work, even in the morning.</p><p>Elizabeth appeared, at 9:00 a.m., with a glass of lemonade.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Gram probably has a cooler somewhere. We could fill it with ice and a few pitchers of lemonade, and you could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer this.\u201d You. Nick raised the glass in a silent toast and met her eyes over its frosted rim. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. What have you and Clara been doing since breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been scanning. She\u2019s been puttering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe scanning\u2019s going to work. It\u2019ll take time, but I have time, and the result will be worth it. That\u2019s the good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClara hasn\u2019t mentioned her eyesight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. But I\u2019ve been watching her. And you\u2019re right. The impairment\u2019s significant. And that\u2019s from the perspective of someone on the outside looking in. I keep thinking what it must be like for her, peering through prisms that both block her view and scatter light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thinking about it, too.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth nodded, and frowned. \u201cI lay awake last night worrying. What if she decides not to do anything? She could get in an accident, Nick. Even in broad daylight on a familiar route. The idea of her being hurt is terrifying enough. And if she injured someone else...She\u2019d never forgive herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that happen, Elizabeth. No matter what she decides.\u201d There was nothing idle in Nick\u2019s reassurance. It was a quiet promise. A solemn vow. \u201cAgreed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>After a moment, he smiled. \u201cI could use another one of these in forty-five minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have it,\u201d Elizabeth said as she took the empty glass. \u201cMore lemonade coming up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just lemonade,\u201d he said. \u201cLemonade and conversation.\u201d Lemonade, he thought, and you.</p><p>By midafternoon, forty-five minutes or so had become forty-five minutes on the dot from when the last lemonade-and-conversation rendezvous ended.</p><p>And, for both of them, forty-five minutes had never felt so long.</p><p>By late afternoon, when the sun blazed its hottest, they\u2019d moved to the shade of a nearby apple tree.</p><p>And talked.</p><p>And talked.</p><p>She wanted to know all about him. He said there was really nothing of interest to tell.</p><p>She responded in kind about herself. He proved her wrong, greeting her replies to his questions\u2014question after question\u2014as if he\u2019d spent his life waiting to hear them.</p><p>She told him, because he wanted to know, about her girlhood summers in Sarah\u2019s Orchard.</p><p>\u201cMy happiest memories are here,\u201d she said as she gazed at the orchard. \u201cI wonder if I\u2019ve ever realized that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything. Being with Gram and Granddad, of course. And spending time with the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I was big enough to be in them. I remember Gram\u2019s horror the first time she saw me scrambling up. Little did I know that I\u2019d inherited my tree-climbing ability from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t fall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever! Nor,\u201d she added, \u201cdid any of these trees ever so much as creak in protest. I was a sturdy girl. Heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHealthy,\u201d Nick countered.</p><p>Elizabeth smiled. \u201cVery. But the trees held my weight as if I was just another bird dropping by.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cPoor trees. My weight was the least of what I subjected them to. I\u2019d climb up, as high as I could go, and sing to the orchard at the top of my lungs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound so bad,\u201d said the man whose life had been joyless until, as a boy, he\u2019d discovered the same joy. \u201cSinging to the trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t bad for me. I loved it. Love to sing. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t begin to carry a tune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the trees didn\u2019t care. You said they never creaked in protest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty gracious. Like my grandparents. I serenaded them endlessly, too. The price of unconditional love, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA price they were delighted to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThey\u2019d even suggest that I sing, if I hadn\u2019t for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo happy. So lucky. What about you, Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cSing for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was asking.\u201d I wasn\u2019t asking, she thought, for your unconditional love. But the serious eyes that met her startled ones seemed willing to offer it. Another mirage, she told herself. And a lingering one...\u201cI\u2014What I meant was, are you a singer? Do you love to sing?\u201d</p><p>The questions were logical. Their answers, she\u2019d have imagined, straightforward.</p><p>But Nick frowned.</p><p>\u201cI can sing,\u201d he said at last. \u201cAnd there was a time, when I was a boy, that I loved singing. Since then, I\u2019ve only sung when people needed me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeeded you to? Because you sing so well and your voice is so comforting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love it anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t sung for a while. Perhaps if I sang with someone who loved to sing, it would come back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming that someone could carry a tune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just break into song.\u201d Not now. Not yet.</p><p>Nick smiled. Neither could he. Not now. Not yet. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably like Christmas songs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a favorite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it. But I suppose, if I had to choose, I\u2019d say \u2018Jingle Bells.\u2019 What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had to choose,\u201d he answered softly, \u201cI\u2019d say \u2018Jingle Bells,\u2019 too.\u201d</p><p>During the three days until the Tuesday afternoon when Nick would have to cancel Gram\u2019s Wednesday-morning eye appointment, he and Elizabeth ate breakfast with her, and lunch and dinner.</p><p>And, at forty-five-minute intervals in between the home-cooked country meals, Nick and Elizabeth talked.</p><p>And, in between that, Elizabeth scanned the letters she\u2019d already read, and read several more. She wasn\u2019t searching for proof that Nick was right in saying Charles would withhold from Clara the horrors of war. But she found it. Even when war claimed the life of a friend.</p><p>May 18, 1942</p><p>My dearest love,</p><p>Danny died in battle three days ago. We brought him back to camp with us, and he\u2019s on his way home to Cedar Rapids.</p><p>I need your help, my darling. As you know, Danny\u2019s family opposed his decision to enlist, and there was anger on both sides when he boarded the train.</p><p>Danny never regretted his decision. He wouldn\u2019t regret it even now. But he regretted the pain he caused his parents, and that he hadn\u2019t made things right with them before he left. He\u2019d been planning to write, to apologize for hurting them and to plead\u2014again\u2014with them to understand. Of all of us, Danny had the clearest vision of the importance of what we\u2019re doing, and must continue to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was a hero, Clara. In life and in death.</p><p>He was also a loving son.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t save Danny. But I have to try to save his parents from suffering more than the immense anguish they\u2019ll feel at his death. The enclosed letter is to them. I\u2019ve written about Danny\u2019s life since they last saw him, the good things, the memories that will make them smile. The jokes he told. The poker face he didn\u2019t have. The way he spoke of them. They need to know his anger was gone. And that he believed, long before he died, that theirs was, too.</p><p>Will you see that my letter gets to Danny\u2019s parents? I don\u2019t have their address. The army will, of course, but it will reach them more quickly if I send it to you. His mother teaches school in Cedar Rapids. Her name is Rose. And his father, Daniel, is a dairy farmer. Danny\u2019s last name, as I\u2019m sure you remember, is Small.</p> <p>I love you, Clara. Please know that without the slightest doubt. And never doubt, either, your support of my decision to go to war.</p><p>It was the right decision, my love. I\u2019m where I need to be, doing what I need to do. For our children, and our children\u2019s children.</p><p>I\u2019m going to see our babies, Clara. And their babies. I will return, my Clara, to you. It\u2019s more than a hope, or a wish, or a dream. It\u2019s a belief, deep inside. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re meant to be the lucky ones, only that we are.</p><p>I\u2019m already the luckiest man on earth, because of you.</p><p>I love you,</p> <p>Charles</p><p>Elizabeth and Nick didn\u2019t touch during those sunny days. Just as Charles and Clara hadn\u2019t touched at the beginning of their love. But the air they breathed was warmed by the sun, and by each other.</p><p>Elizabeth was breathing some of that air, holding on to it, when, just hours before Nick was going to call the clinic, Gram spoke the words she and Nick had been hoping to hear.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should see someone about my eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Elizabeth said with impressive calm.</p><p>\u201cThere might not be anything that can be done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s worth finding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. I suppose the next step would be to make an appointment. One of the perks of living in a town with a state-of-the-art medical center is that there\u2019s likely to be a good ophthalmologist close by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are several. All terrific. But Nick\u2019s arranged for you to see the one he felt you\u2019d like the best. You have an appointment with her at eleven tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a lovely young man, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elizabeth whispered. \u201cHe is.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>Clara\u2019s cataracts were \u201cripe,\u201d the doctor said. That was good. From a surgical perspective, they were ready to be removed. And, Dr. Diana Hathaway added, Clara was very likely to benefit from the surgery.</p><p>The standard of care, to which the Harvard-trained ophthalmologist resolutely adhered, was to operate on one eye at a time. Assuming the outcome was positive and complications hadn\u2019t occurred, surgery on the other would be deferred to a later date.</p> <p>Typically, she liked to do the surgery three weeks following the initial evaluation. That gave the patient an opportunity to prepare, and to have the physical and lab exams that were prudent before anesthesia.</p><p>Dr. Hathaway had an opening in three weeks. She\u2019d hold it for Clara, unless...It turned out there was a last-minute cancellation, a patient with the flu. The surgery had been scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. The internist, whom Clara hadn\u2019t seen for far too long, since before Charles\u2019s stroke, could examine her today, and labs could be done immediately.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d Clara said.</p><p>\u201cI really like your drawings of the orchard.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth looked from her clenched fists to the calm face from which the improbable words had come.</p><p>She and Nick were in the surgical waiting area. They weren\u2019t alone, but whoever had arranged the furnishings had done so as if each group of chairs was a private island. Their two chairs were angled so that they faced each other and no one else.</p><p>\u201cYou do not. But,\u201d she said, \u201cas a ploy to distract me from worrying about Gram, it was pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have been a ploy, but it was also the truth. I\u2019ve been thinking they\u2019d make nice labels for the apple butter jars. The company needs a logo. What better than seasons of the orchard, as drawn by Clara\u2019s granddaughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were drawn by an eight-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was passionate about the apple trees. I really like the drawings, Elizabeth. The winter one, especially.\u201d</p><p>He seemed on the verge of saying something else. Whether he\u2019d thought better of it, or simply sensed the approach of Diana Hathaway, Elizabeth would never know.</p><p>Dr. Hathaway wore scrubs, a white coat, surgical booties and a smile.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in recovery. The surgery went fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. She should be awake within the hour, and, once she\u2019s steady on her feet, she\u2019ll be ready to go home. As I mentioned yesterday, her eye needs to remain covered until I see her tomorrow afternoon, and to the extent it\u2019s possible, keeping both eyes closed is best. It will be possible, I think. It\u2019ll be dark by the time you get her home, and since she may not have slept terribly well last night, she should be able to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we all will,\u201d Nick said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t touch the dark circles beneath Elizabeth\u2019s eyes. But the worry in his voice was a gentle caress.</p><p>Elizabeth tucked Gram into bed while Nick waited downstairs.</p><p>\u201cComfy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery comfy,\u201d Gram said.</p><p>\u201cAnd sleepy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting there. You do not, however, need to stay with me till I drift off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I want to.\u201d</p><p>Gram smiled, and because Elizabeth had been so adamant about it, resisted opening\u2014and winking with\u2014the unpatched eye. \u201cWhat shall we talk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you like, Gram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Clara said. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that if my vision does improve, maybe it is time for me to read Granddad\u2019s letters. I know you could\u2014and would\u2014read them to me. But seeing his handwriting would be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see it. They\u2019re wonderful letters, Gram. He loved you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t read all the letters yet, but Nick says he doesn\u2019t believe Granddad would ever tell you what he saw in battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he wasn\u2019t sharing everything? I suppose it did at first. But I realized he needed not to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe never talked about what he saw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Gram said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Elizabeth asked softly when Gram\u2019s frowning expression told her there was more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wondered if he talked to Nick. If they talked to each other. There were times, especially after Charles\u2019s stroke, when they\u2019d go to the orchard and stand side by side gazing at the trees. I\u2019d think they weren\u2019t speaking, but maybe they were, in the way men do. One word, when we might have used a thousand. And, on occasion, a solemn nod. They wouldn\u2019t have needed many words, of course. Wouldn\u2019t have needed to explain. They\u2019d both seen the unspeakable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d</p><p>Gram\u2019s unpatched eye opened, concerned.</p><p>\u201cBoth, Gram?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick hasn\u2019t had a chance to tell you yet.\u201d</p><p>Oh yes, he has. Whatever it was Nick hadn\u2019t told her, it wasn\u2019t because he hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to do so. Choice, not chance, determined what he\u2019d shared. A choice Nicholas Lawton had every right to make.</p><p>\u201cTell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe spent some time in the military.\u201d</p><p>Enough time, Gram had already revealed, to see the unspeakable. \u201cClose your eye,\u201d Elizabeth ordered.</p><p>\u201cNot until you stop looking so upset.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth flashed a smile. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnconvincing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! So Nick hasn\u2019t mentioned his military service to me. Why should he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy vision may have been problematic, but my hearing hasn\u2019t. Nick cares about you, Elizabeth. And you care about him. Please remember, darling girl, that our men, our soldiers, need to be able not to tell us about their battles. And because we love them, and trust them, we can give them that gift.\u201d</p><p>Gram closed her eye then, and moments later drifted off to sleep.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, dearest Gram,\u201d Elizabeth whispered as she withdrew. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She stood at the top of the staircase, gathering her emotions. So Nick had omitted that key bit of data about his life. So what? He was under no obligation to tell her anything\u2014much less everything.</p><p>This was far from a betrayal. Elizabeth knew betrayal\u2014Matthew\u2019s\u2014and had weathered it admirably.</p><p>The only trouble was she hadn\u2019t been in love with Matthew....</p><p>Nick was outside, in the orchard, standing in the precise spot\u2014perhaps\u2014where he and Granddad had shared in silence as much as in words the secrets of men who went to war.</p><p>He smiled as she approached. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s smile went away. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you in the military?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve and a half years. Elizabeth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me you\u2019d always been a handyman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cthat from the time I was seven, whenever I saw something that needed to be fixed, I wanted to fix it. That\u2019s the reason I became a soldier. I believed I could help make the world a better place. I knew, at least, that I had to try.\u201d He met her eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to you. And when I told you about the things Charles might have seen in battle, the fear and rage he might have felt, I was talking about myself. I was telling you, Elizabeth, more than I\u2019ve ever told anyone...more than I ever believed I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my military service? No. There isn\u2019t. And I understand what that means. You didn\u2019t know the man I was before I went to war. You can\u2019t know, as Clara knew about her Charles, that I\u2019d have died before committing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that, Nick!\u201d On faith, she thought. On love. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something else I want to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth shivered, but not from fear about what he\u2019d reveal. She trusted this man. Believed in this man. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick...\u201d</p><p>He shivered, too. Not from fear. Her shining eyes gave him her reply.</p><p>Elizabeth saw his joy. His desire.</p><p>Then he was touching her, holding her head as he gazed at her, wanting her.</p><p>\u201cNick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>As his mouth found hers, her hands curved over his wrists. She tasted his desire, felt his strength. He had the power to crush her...or to protect her with everything he had.</p><p>The kiss ended with a sigh, and a promise. There\u2019d be more, so much more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips caressed her fingertips as he spoke. \u201cI\u2019ve been wondering what kept me alive, kept me believing the fight was right and good.

Seeing clearly! Love!</p> <p>Dearest Winifred and Helen (for whom I\u2019m popping a colorful copy of this colorful e-mail in today\u2019s post),</p><p>Please accept my apologies for being so remiss in not responding to you before now. As both of you knew, losing Charles has been difficult. I\u2019ll always miss him, as you miss your beloved Sam and Richard. I feel he\u2019s closer to me now than in those impossible months after he died. He was never very far away, I realize. I just wasn\u2019t able to find him. I\u2019m letting the memories of our love come back to me now, and smiling when they do, and he\u2019s right there with them.</p><p>I have fabulous\u2014and interesting\u2014news.</p><p>The fabulous, first. Elizabeth and Nick (yes, Nick!) are in love. Matthew was wrong for her, and, fortunately, she discovered it in time. But Nick is so right for her and loves her as she should be loved, and she loves him\u2014as he should be loved\u2014right back.</p><p>They\u2019re planning to live in Sarah\u2019s Orchard. She\u2019ll be the Apple Butter Ladies\u2019 \u201cin house\u201d counsel to begin with, and if the legal spirit moves her, she\u2019ll branch out from there. Her first corporate responsibility will be to register the official Apple Butter Ladies\u2019 logo (the .JPEG is attached, and, Helen, you have an eight-by-twelve-inch glossy). She drew the pictures when she was eight, and we\u2019ve scanned them into the computer (I\u2019m becoming quite good at scanning) and made the four-quadrant design. The winter apple tree, with its red Christmas lights, will\u2014I think\u2014also become the invitation to Nick and Elizabeth\u2019s Christmastime wedding. (You\u2019ll each be receiving one.)</p><p>I\u2019m so thrilled for both of them. And I know, know, that Charles is, too. As for my social-butterfly daughter, we\u2019ll discover what she\u2019s really made of (ancient blue-blood genes or motherly love) when she and Thomas visit next weekend. Call me an optimist, but I\u2019m betting on her daughter\u2019s happiness trumping every snobbish impulse she might have.</p><p>My interesting news is that I\u2019ve recently had cataract surgery. (Cataract-surgery advocate that I\u2019ve become, I plan to have both eyes done). I\u2019m more than an advocate. I feel like sharing what feels like a miracle to everyone I know (or don\u2019t know!). That\u2019s why I\u2019m attaching (and including) a few articles on the topic. If any of the signs or symptoms seem familiar to you, please, please, please make an appointment with an ophthalmologist. Or, even better, come on down and see mine, Dr. Diana Hathaway, the loveliest and most competent surgeon you\u2019ll ever meet. If the prospect of making the trip to Sarah\u2019s Orchard is off-putting, too much of an ordeal, that may be a symptom in itself. Elizabeth, Nick and I would be delighted to provide door-to-door service\u2014anytime!</p><p>You can see how giddy I am about this. But it\u2019s such a gift to see colors again. Without my even realizing it, the world had become a dull, dull gray. And I can read again. And play cards. And smile at the night sky. And send belated messages to my two dearest friends.</p><p>I\u2019ll write often, now that once again I can. Our friendship means so much to me and has meant so much for so long, I can hardly bear to think it might have faded (as colors did) because of tiny deposits in my eyes\u2014aaaaaah! Never.</p><p>Take care, dear ones. All my love,</p><p>Clara </p> </body></html>"]
