Philadelphia\u2019s Tarleton-Dandridge House sat back from the street, majestic and stately, in the light that had just begun to fade, as fine and poignant as an old building could be, a proud remnant of an era long gone, yet ever remembered.</p><p>Julian Mitchell almost felt guilty. Almost. He couldn\u2019t quite manage guilt; he was too ecstatic over his day, still pumped with enthusiasm and the beat of the music he\u2019d been playing. He enjoyed being a guide at the Tarleton-Dandridge, but today he\u2019d had to ditch it. The audition had been important and, much as he loved his job, he loved the idea of working full-time as a guitarist more. Sure, it was great dressing up and playing with the band in Old Town, but he had dreams of being a real rock star. Now, however, he had to slip back into the house\u2014and suck up to Allison. She was their unofficial leader, head of the guides or docents at the Tarleton-Dandridge, and if she forgave him, the others would, too.</p><p>He saw that one group of guests had already entered the house with their guide and that another, the last group of the day, was assembling just outside the main door. He could see Allison Leigh to the side of the house near the gate, welcoming those who were gathering for the final tour. Allison was dressed in the typical fashion of the Revolutionary era\u2014the typical high fashion of the Revolutionary era, since female guides wore clothing along the lines of that which would\u2019ve been worn by Lucy Tarleton, the martyred heroine of the house. The male guides dressed as Lord Brian Bradley, the British general known as \u201cBeast\u201d Bradley, who had occupied the house.</p> <p>They all looked pretty cool in their clothing, he thought. But especially Allison. She was beautiful to begin with, even if she was kind of a nerd. A real academic. But she did bear a resemblance to the heroine she played, Lucy Tarleton. They\u2019d all remarked on her resemblance to the painting in the house and those in various museums, but there was no evidence that she was a descendent of the woman. And if anyone would know, Allison would, since she was a historian. Maybe it was the clothing that gave her the look.</p><p>Allison wasn\u2019t even glancing his way, so he quickly jumped the old brick wall that surrounded the house.</p><p>He was still in his period clothing from the morning shift; he hadn\u2019t sneaked out until after lunch. Luckily, his band\u2019s audition had been to open for the new \u201cit\u201d group\u2014rockers who liked to dress up like Patrick Henry and friends\u2014which meant he hadn\u2019t had to worry about auditioning in his work outfit.</p><p>Of course, he hadn\u2019t asked for the time off. He\u2019d decided that in life it was generally better to do and ask forgiveness later than it was to beg for permission and get a big fat no! What guilt he did feel was because one of his colleagues had to take the tour group he should have led.</p><p>Still, he had a plan. He\u2019d wait until the last group had gone through, and Jason and Allison had finished for the day. He winced; he realized Annette wasn\u2019t at work. She\u2019d made an appointment for a root canal. But he knew his fellow docents as well as they knew him. Jason would leave before Ally. Julian just had to wait until Jason had left and Allison was alone, checking as she always did that the doors were locked and the alarm system was on. She would come down to Angus\u2019s study\u2014ye olde study, where that poor bastard Angus Tarleton had died, supposedly of a broken heart\u2014to make sure no kids were hiding under the desk to spend the night in the \u201chaunted\u201d house. He\u2019d wait for her there. When Ally showed up, he would beg and plead and he could honestly tell her they\u2019d probably get the gig, and he\u2019d do anything to compensate for the time he\u2019d missed. And he\u2019d promise her backstage passes to the first concert.</p> <p>He tiptoed to the front door and listened. Once Jason\u2019s tour had moved into the social rooms to the left, he hurried up the stairs. But when he reached the second-floor landing, he heard conversation and footsteps coming down from the attic. He dodged into Lucy Tarleton\u2019s room. He\u2019d forgotten the board was meeting at the house that day. He\u2019d have to wait until they were gone.</p><p>At last, they were. He heard the foursome going down the main stairway. As usual, they were bickering among themselves.</p><p>\u201cCherry, you may be a descendent of the family, but this place is owned by Old Philly History now. We\u2019re only the board.\u201d She started to speak, but Ethan Oxford interrupted her. \u201cYes, it\u2019s privately owned and operated, but there\u2019s a charter. The house was donated for the preservation of history.\u201d</p><p>Old Ethan Oxford was the senior member of the board. Cherry\u2019s mother had been the last of the Dandridge family. Cherry would probably have eschewed her own father\u2019s name to take on Dandridge, Julian was certain, except that her husband, George Addison, was becoming a very well-known artist, and she liked the prestige that came with being Mrs. Addison.</p><p>\u201cNo one knows this house like I do,\u201d Cherry insisted.</p><p>\u201cReally? You never lived in it. It was handed over to Old Philly History long before you were born.\u201d</p> <p>Julian smiled. That voice belonged to Nathan Pierson, who loved to listen sweetly to Cherry and then zing her.</p><p>\u201cHush!\u201d Sarah Vining said. \u201cThere are tour groups in here!\u201d</p><p>A moment later, even their voices faded away as they left the house.</p><p>Julian started toward the attic but paused. For some reason, he had the odd sensation of being held in the room and he turned around, curious. He saw nothing there. Nothing except the painting of Beast Bradley. The nice painting of Bradley. \u201cThey say you were a brutal bastard. Glad someone saw the good in you!\u201d Julian said. Giving himself a mental shake, he dashed up to the attic to hide. He sat at the desk there, glancing at the piles of paper around the computer and the countless file folders. Some of the information here was pure business\u2014schedules, events planned at the estate, programs planned, money collected. But most of the piles belonged to Ally. Professor Allison Leigh. \u201cYou would have to be a brainiac!\u201d he said aloud. He was a year or two younger than Ally, but he\u2019d had a crush on her since he\u2019d taken his position here. And she wasn\u2019t all work and no play. He knew because she\u2019d dated another musician for a while, an acquaintance of his.</p><p>\u201cYou may have brains, Ally, but your taste in men isn\u2019t so great.\u201d It was one thing to have a casual friendship with a drug addict; it was another to date one. Ally\u2019s romance had ended when she realized she couldn\u2019t compete with his cocaine habit.</p><p>Ah, well, history seemed to be her true love. He picked up the nearest folder and began to read. \u201cHuh!\u201d he murmured. Apparently, she\u2019d found a new lead on an old subject.</p><p>To his own surprise, he became interested in her notes. Ally definitely seemed to be on to something. He set down the folder and listened carefully. It was safe to go down to the second floor, he decided, since Jason\u2019s tour group had departed.</p><p>Julian hurried back to Lucy\u2019s bedroom. There was a beautiful rendering of a young Lucy on one wall. She was dressed in white and had a look of open excitement in her eyes, as if she loved life, and the whole world. It had been an eighteenth-birthday gift to Lucy from Levy Perry, an artist killed at Brandywine. Naturally, it was painted before either of them had learned about the horrors of war.</p> <p>He turned from the image of Lucy and stared at the painting of Beast Bradley again.</p><p>\u201cCharmer, were you?\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not what history says.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he could, he\u2019d go down to Angus\u2019s study and wait for Ally. If she gave him any grief, he could tell her he\u2019d read her notes about Bradley and Lucy, and they were brilliant, just brilliant.</p><p>Interesting that the painting of Beast Bradley in the study was nothing like this one.</p><p>He smiled. He\u2019d have the chance to stare at that one for a while. Because he wanted to be in Angus\u2019s chair when Ally found him. He was dressed as Beast Bradley\u2014why not play the part completely as he begged her to forgive him? It was the perfect way to convince her that he was serious about his job here. At least until his music career was well and truly launched...</p><p>Leaving Lucy\u2019s bedroom, he reached the door and thought he heard a noise behind him. But that was impossible.</p><p>Unless it was good old Beast Bradley himself, roused from the dead to rummage through the research papers?</p><p>Tiptoeing down the stairs he laughed. He opened the hall closet on the first floor to pick up the reproduction muzzle-loading musket and bayonet that went with his uniform.</p><p>He heard a noise again and frowned. It couldn\u2019t be coming from the attic. No, he told himself, the rustling was probably outside.</p><p>\u201c\u2018I ain\u2019t afraid of no ghosts!\u2019\u201d he muttered.</p><p>And yet, it was with great unease that he waited.</p><p>He felt he was being watched.</p><p>And followed.</p><p>1</p><p>\u201cAre you Dolley Madison? Or, like, Martha Washington or something?\u201d one of the boys edging toward the front of Allison Leigh\u2019s tour asked. He was about nine or ten, still awkward, but obviously determined to create some havoc\u2014no doubt to avoid embarrassing himself in front of the few other teens and preteens on the tour.</p><p>A taller, older boy, maybe twelve, who might have been his brother, nudged him. \u201cYou idiot, they\u2019re both dead, and she\u2019s alive. And she\u2019s hot, buddy. She\u2019s way too hot even in that getup to be one of those old ladies.\u201d The second boy tried to look mature. He reminded Allison of a very young Adam Sandler. The boys were part of her tour, which included a mix of ages. Summer was just drawing to a close and families were still on vacation.</p><p>She heard someone behind her choke back laughter; it was Nathan Pierson, longtime board member for the nonprofit organization that now owned the Tarleton-Dandridge House. They\u2019d had a meeting in the attic, where a small office was located. Cherry Addison, the remaining descendent of the Dandridge clan, had already moved on, spike heels clicking. Ethan Oxford, their eldest member, had politely made his way through the crowd. Nathan and Sarah Vining were the last of the four board members to leave the house.</p><p>Nathan grinned and winked at Allison as he approached. Sarah hurried to catch up with him. She was a wisp of a woman who had given herself frown lines worrying about the board\u2019s every move, while Nathan was the opposite, always certain things would work out. He was a slim and stately man in his forties, not exactly a father figure, more like a cool-uncle figure. And he was amused. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ally shot him a warning glance, but he kept grinning as he stepped past her. When he looked back and winked again, she forced a smile to her lips and turned her attention back to the group.</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks, I think,\u201d she told the boy who\u2019d spoken. There was nothing like having a few young kids on the tour, giggling and not the least bit interested in the history of the Tarleton-Dandridge House\u2014or the nation, for that matter. They didn\u2019t want to be here and were going to be thorns in her side if she didn\u2019t do something quickly. Ghost tours were the answer in situations like this.</p><p>To most kids an old house just seemed stuffy and boring. She understood how they felt, even though she\u2019d always been the odd kid out herself\u2014a history nerd, as Julian liked to call her. She was from Philadelphia; she\u2019d gone to Boston for her bachelor and master\u2019s, and to New York for her doctorate, but she loved her own city almost as if it were a friend with whom she\u2019d grown up. From the time she was little, she\u2019d gaped at Independence Hall and marveled that she could stand in the same place where some of the greatest men in American history had stood.</p> <p>She surveyed the crowd and concluded that the two boys were indeed brothers, dragged along on a historical jaunt by their parents, the attractive couple a few feet back.</p><p>\u201cActually, my name is Allison Leigh, and the person I\u2019m dressed to portray is Lucy Tarleton. And,\u201d she added teasingly, \u201cshe\u2019s supposed to haunt the place, so I\u2019d be careful if I were you.\u201d She took a step closer to the taller of the two brothers. \u201cShe wants you to know your history.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and struck a swaggering pose. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind meeting up with a hot ghost,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know all about her. Lucy Tarleton, that is. We went on a ghost tour last night! She was a spy. Like a Hairy Mata.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMata Hari!\u201d his dad whispered, shaking his head in amusement but setting a hand on the boy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSorry!\u201d he murmured to Allison.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Allison assured him. She turned back to the boy. \u201cGreat, then you\u2019re in the know,\u201d she said gravely. \u201cYou could meet up with Lucy today. Or maybe the ghost of Lord Brian \u2018Beast\u2019 Bradley, who is said to have murdered several patriots in cold blood, among them Lucy Tarleton.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGhosts? Bring \u2019em on!\u201d the boy shouted.</p><p>\u201cTodd,\u201d his father chastised. \u201cKeep it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. Everyone loves historic ghost stories,\u201d Allison said. She did like kids and understood that they were going to be, well, kids. She just wished people would recognize the human toll of war and what history could teach them.</p><p>She stepped back to welcome her entire group of fifteen. \u201cGood evening,\u201d she said loudly, \u201cand welcome to the Tarleton-Dandridge House, here in historic Philadelphia!\u201d</p><p>Trees swayed gently in the breeze, and the air had taken on a sweet chill that might have been the promise of rain or merely the slow descent from summer into fall. Dusk was coming, and with it, a soft fog. They hadn\u2019t shortened their hours at the mansion yet, but the last tour was usually out while there was still a glimmer of light in the sky.</p><p>Watching the sky and feeling the breeze, Allison Leigh thought she didn\u2019t mind the long days at all, even if she was tired tonight. Of course, a lot of what she did was by rote and she could do it in her sleep, but she was fascinated by history, and adored the old historic house where she worked as a guide when her teaching schedule allowed. Summers generally meant full-time guiding. She liked people, too, especially children and young adults, and valued the opportunity to show them where the fate of a nation had been decided and to discuss both the Colonial era and the Revolution itself.</p> <p>On most busy days the other three guides did their share of the tours. Annette Fanning, a good friend as well as coworker, had left early, scheduled for a root canal. Jason Lawrence was leading the tour group just ahead, dressed in the manner of the British dandy, Lord Bradley, who\u2019d resided in the house when the patriots had fled. Julian Mitchell, the fourth guide employed by the private nonprofit corporation that owned the house, had disappeared around lunchtime. He was an effective guide, but he was also running around auditioning with his band, and had a tendency to show up late or disappear early. With the last of the school-age crowd going through at the tail end of summer, his lack of responsibility was irritating, but this tour was it for the night\u2014and then she\u2019d be ready to close up and go home. They all liked Julian; he was just driving them crazy.</p><p>\u201cWatch out! A ghost\u2019s going to follow you home,\u201d a young man in the crowd whispered to the boys. He smiled, looking at the young woman with him, his wife or girlfriend, as if watching the boys because he might want a few of his own one day.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think ghosts follow you home,\u201d the younger of the two brothers said bravely. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re supposed to haunt a place, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they can follow you home!\u201d his brother teased. \u201cThey can go through walls, can\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it!\u201d the younger one said.</p><p>His brother made chicken sounds.</p><p>Allison clapped her hands to draw their attention back to the tour. \u201cThe Tarleton-Dandridge House is open to help you understand the Revolutionary War and the occupation of Philadelphia, not to send ghosts home with anyone,\u201d she announced. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll start with a brief history, although I\u2019m sure you know most of this. Philadelphia was the first capital of the United States. And the Declaration of Independence was written and signed here. But by that time, shots had been fired in Boston\u2014and the British navy was occupying Staten Island. What you may not realize is that the First Continental Congress worked here before they decided on independence. At first, they were seeking a means to achieve...can someone tell me?\u201d</p><p>Oddly enough, it was her swaggering young beau, the older brother, who raised his hand. \u201cNo taxation without representation!\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cVery good. So, since it looked like the royal foot was coming down to punish the colonies for their revolt against taxes\u2014and they\u2019d already risked being hanged for protesting lack of representation, the next step was to go all the way. Make the stakes worth the consequences, in other words. But it wasn\u2019t the citizens of Philadelphia who were eager for war, or at least not all of them. Remember, this area was settled by the Quaker William Penn. He granted the city its charter. Those who believe in the Quaker creed are and have always been antiwar and antiviolence, but by the time of the American Revolution, this was a city of about thirty thousand, all mixed in their beliefs and backgrounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! They were ready to fight for freedom!\u201d the older boy said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBy then the colonies had formed the Second Continental Congress, so a fight for independence it became. But Philadelphia would pay the price. The British wanted the capital. According to their logic, if you took the capital, the rest of the upstarts would fall apart and surrender. However, General George Washington had learned from his Indian wars, and he waged a different kind of warfare. Still, we lost many battles and, as I said, Philadelphia and her residents paid a heavy toll.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to have won over the boys, which pleased her, and they were looking at her intently now rather than gawking.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, if you will?\u201d she asked the two brothers.</p><p>They actually seemed nervous as she walked back to the podium by the gate. She took out two mock Colonial muskets and gave them to the boys. The male guides carried exceptionally accurate reproduction muskets, but to entertain young adults before entering the house, the guides used mock-up plastic muskets.</p><p>\u201cNow, how would you feel if I put you twenty feet apart and told you to shoot at each other? Do you think it would make a lot of sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shoot enough and...I guess we could hit each other,\u201d the taller boy said. \u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d the younger brother added.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMuskets of the day weren\u2019t great on aim. For every shot, a man had to load his powder, tamp it down and hope the enemy wasn\u2019t upon him before he could fire again. What are your names?\u201d she asked the boys.</p><p>The younger brother was Jimmy, she discovered, and the older one was Todd. She had them perform and they followed her instructions, demonstrating a manner of fighting in which they walked toward each other, and then another manner, in which one of them hid behind a tree.</p><p>\u201cGeorge Washington had learned well, don\u2019t you think? He knew the British could outman, outpower and outdiscipline him. So if they wanted the city, he\u2019d take to the countryside. Back in the 1770s, for about a hundred miles all around Philadelphia, there was nothing but wilderness. Washington could abandon the city, let the British move in for a while, and the Revolutionary government could keep trying to sway the French to join us, which happened in 1778. And the British knew they could become locked in, trapped. So they in turn had to abandon the city.\u201d</p><p>Allison checked the little watch she wore on a chain around her neck, and saw that she\u2019d given Jason plenty of time to take his group through.</p><p>\u201cShall we enter the house?\u201d she said, opening the gate that led up to the handsome brick house.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Todd blurted out.</p><p>She arched a brow at him. He grinned, and she smiled back.</p><p>As she led her group into the small but beautifully manicured yard, Allison told them, \u201cThe house was built in 1752 of brick and stone, in what was known as the Flemish style, with alternating longer and shorter bricks. It was built for Lucy Tarleton\u2019s father, an Irish immigrant who rose to success and attained great riches as a merchant\u2014and had no love for the British King George.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMad King George!\u201d Jimmy said.</p><p>\u201cYes, so they called him.\u201d Allison paused on the porch, waiting for the stragglers to catch up.</p><p>\u201cKing George never set foot here, of course,\u201d she went on. \u201cThe days of kings leading their men into battle were long gone. But as for King George\u2019s war,\u201d Allison said, \u201cthere were two English brothers in control of the war effort here\u2014Admiral Richard Howe on the water and General William Howe on land. One thing they hoped, of course, was that many citizens would be loyal to Britain and start coming out of the woodwork when they arrived.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd there were citizens loyal to Great Britain, right?\u201d Jimmy asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. There were citizens loyal to Great Britain, although many moved to Canada\u2014the United Empire Loyalists\u2014when the war began. But this city was a prize to the British, harder to obtain than they\u2019d expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rivers weren\u2019t deep enough for the Royal navy!\u201d Todd said. \u201cI know that because we\u2019ve been on so many history tours already!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Allison agreed. \u201cAnd there were numerous unseen obstacles under the water. It was difficult! But eventually they made their way here.\u201d She continued the story she\u2019d told so many times before. \u201cPhiladelphia fell to the British, and was held by them from September 26, 1777, through June 18, 1778. General Washington deprived them of greater victory by seeing that the city was abandoned and the Continental Congress moved to New York City. The British set up a puppet government in Philadelphia for that nine-month period. Meanwhile, the British soldiers enjoyed the warmth and comfort of some of these splendid homes, while Washington\u2019s men froze at Valley Forge. And so here, at this beautiful mansion, Lucy Tarleton stayed behind, pretending to be loyal to the Crown, throwing parties, and even feigning a romance with Lord Brian Bradley\u2014soon to be known as \u2018Beast\u2019 Bradley, and soon to execute\u2014without trial or king\u2019s command\u2014the lovely patriot, Lucy Tarleton. Lucy was indeed passing British secrets to General Washington down in Valley Forge. She was passionate about her cause and she was to die for her efforts, in a rare but tragically vindictive incident. Follow me.\u201d</p><p>The front door led through a tiny mudroom with cut-glass windows and then into a grand foyer. \u201cIn the city, you\u2019ll find that many businesses were on the first floors of what are now historic buildings, while the living quarters were upstairs. But here, a servant would greet guests in the foyer, and determine where they\u2019d go. Mr. Tarleton\u2019s study was to your right, while the salon was the first room to your left,\u201d she said, gesturing in those directions. \u201cThe kitchen is still a separate house out back, which prevented a cooking fire from reaching the main house. Beyond the salon is the dining room, and it gave the servants easy access to the kitchen. The left side of the house as you face me was the entertainment area, you might say, and to your right were the family rooms. In back of the study is the ladies\u2019 parlor, and behind that, the music room. You\u2019ll see an exquisite harpsichord there that actually belonged to the Tarleton family. Upstairs, there are five bedrooms and the attic, which contained storage space and rooms for the servants. The Tarletons had five household servants who lived in the main house and a number of gardeners and grooms who lived over the carriage house, which is also preserved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServants! I could use a few!\u201d the boys\u2019 mother said, ruffling her younger son\u2019s hair.</p><p>Allison grinned and went on to describe various objects in the house. Then she explained that because of tight spaces and narrow hallways, they should go by themselves and look into the rooms on their own, respecting the velvet cord barriers. \u201cSo, please go ahead and walk through the first floor, and I\u2019ll be here to answer any questions. Don\u2019t forget to note the dumbwaiter at the rear of the dining room! It\u2019s still in perfect working order.\u201d</p><p>She stood in the foyer, in a central area so guests could question her. She was surprised when Todd came up to her. She suspected some kind of sexual innuendo, but he seemed oddly quiet and awed. \u201cMiss, can you come here for a minute?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure, Todd.\u201d She followed him to the doorway of Tarleton\u2019s study. The room held his large carved maple desk, reproduction ledgers, quills, ink pots, study chairs and wooden shelves, some covered with glass doors. There were two paintings that dominated the walls in the room, one of Angus Tarleton himself, painted when he was a young man with shiny dark hair and bright blue eyes, traits he\u2019d passed on to his daughter.</p><p>But Todd was staring at the other painting. He pointed at it.</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s the man they called \u2018Beast\u2019 Bradley,\u201d she told him. \u201cBrian Bradley. Remember? We talked about him.\u201d She stared at the painting, too. Bradley was a young man in the portrait, with a narrow face, high cheekbones, and dark, brooding eyes. Allison had always thought that although the portrait was certainly flattering, the artist hadn\u2019t liked the man. The cruelty for which he would one day be known seemed painted into the sharpness of his features and the look in his eyes. He was elegantly dressed, in the fashion of his day. And while he was a general in the king\u2019s army, she\u2019d seldom seen him depicted in uniform. She assumed that wearing anything that might be rank and file\u2014even with elevating insignias\u2014would have been, in his eyes, beneath him.</p><p>Todd shivered, still pointing at the portrait.</p><p>\u201cAnd a ghost will follow you home!\u201d he said, and his words weren\u2019t light. He was truly unnerved.</p> <p>\u201cHe was a horrible man, but he\u2019s long gone,\u201d Allison said, surprised that the would-be \u201ccool\u201d preteen now seemed more like a scared schoolboy.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t gone,\u201d Todd said. \u201cHe...he looked at me.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Allison felt a chill. She tried to tell herself the boy was trying to tease her, play off the situation and get her to slip an arm around him.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t playing any games. He appeared really frightened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way the portrait\u2019s painted,\u201d Allison assured him, but she found herself staring up at Bradley again. She never came into this room when she was alone, locking up and setting the alarms for the night. She always stood in the doorway, glanced in and moved on. While the house was equipped with a modern alarm system, they were supposed to make sure no visitors tried to stay on to defy the ghosts of the mansion.</p><p>Legend had it that Beast Bradley had thrust his knife straight into the heart of Lucy Tarleton in the grand salon; he\u2019d killed her there while her father had wept for her life and been forced to watch. To add to the cruelty of the act, he\u2019d left Angus Tarleton alive to hold his dying daughter. According to history\u2014in this case, the accounts that were handed down by the survivors\u2014Brian Bradley hadn\u2019t killed Lucy for her patriot escapades. He\u2019d killed her because he\u2019d discovered she was false to him, that she wasn\u2019t in love with him at all.</p><p>Before the arrival of the British, Lucy was about to become betrothed to another patriot, Stewart Douglas, who had fled the city with other American soldiers. It was a sad tale, one Allison would share in a few minutes when she\u2019d gathered her people in the foyer again.</p><p>\u201cTodd, this is a creepy picture of a man who was apparently a monster, which had far more to do with him than with the fact that he was British. Horrendous incidents, beyond any code of warfare, have taken place during just about every conflict in history. But the British weren\u2019t monsters, and neither were the colonists. Most of the evidence we have says that Bradley did behave abominably, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d Todd asked her.</p><p>\u201cActually, no one knows, but it\u2019s presumed that he was killed in the fighting soon after the British abandoned the city. Howe was furious with him for his brutal actions in Philadelphia. They argued before the Battle of Saratoga, and he disappeared from history,\u201d Allison said. \u201cA few letters that mention him have been preserved, and some suspect he might have been killed by his own men. Those letters suggest he was a brutal commander, as well. Way, way, way back, he was related to the Royal House of Hanover, and he seemed to think he was entitled to his behavior through the divine right of kings\u2014even though he was certainly not a king and never going to be one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still here,\u201d Todd whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>She did set an arm around his shoulders. Allison was about five-ten in her two-inch Colonial pumps, giving her a bit of height over him. \u201cTodd, that was then, and this is now, and you need to see the rest of the house, learn about the history, and have fun with your family tonight. The historic tavern restaurants, where they serve in Colonial garb and entertain with flutes and old jokes, are really fun. You\u2019ll enjoy that.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, gazing at the painting as if drawn to it.</p><p>She led him firmly from the study. \u201cWhat happened to the house after the British left?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAngus died a year after his daughter. She had a younger sister, Sophia, who married a fine American soldier, Tobias Dandridge, and they inherited the house. It\u2019s now owned by a private corporation called Old Philly History, and there\u2019s still a descendent on the board of governors. The house stayed in the family until 1930, when the owner formed this corporation. That\u2019s why so many of the original family pieces have been preserved.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d managed to get Todd back into the foyer, and she smiled at him as she related the history of the house she\u2019d just given him.</p><p>\u201cNow, the upstairs. We\u2019ll go up together and I\u2019ll wait in the hall while you look in all the rooms,\u201d Allison said cheerfully. \u201cThe master bedroom is at the far end of the house, but the one everyone finds most interesting is Lucy\u2019s room, on the right side of the staircase. She and her sister both had grand rooms with large dressing rooms. There\u2019s a 1700s tub in Lucy\u2019s room, which is authentic to the house.\u201d</p><p>She sent them off and waited, watching Todd. He ignored all the rooms except for Lucy\u2019s.</p><p>He came back to stand by her. \u201cI saw her picture on the wall. Lucy\u2019s picture. You look like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think a lot of women do when they\u2019re dressed like her,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>Todd nodded solemnly. \u201cMaybe. But you mostly.\u201d He studied her for a moment and then whispered, \u201cSomeone else died in the study, right?\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. After all, the family had gone on a ghost tour last night. Though the house itself was closed to these ghost tours, they all walked by it and embellished the tales that went along with it. Personally, she thought the truth was far more haunting than anything they could make up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA lieutenant who fought in the War of 1812 came here when he was wounded, and he died soon after. Another soldier on the Union side in the Civil War also died in that room. And yes, one of the Dandridge girls died there in 1890\u2014she took poison to commit suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a few years ago, one of you was found dead in the room, right?\u201d Todd asked her, wide-eyed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to give all this information when the tour gathers again,\u201d she told him.</p> <p>\u201cRight?\u201d he persisted. She felt acutely uncomfortable. Every old house had its history. Naturally some of it was sad and even distressing.</p><p>\u201cAngela Wilson did die in that room. She had a heart attack while locking up one night.\u201d</p><p>Todd regarded her solemnly. \u201cShe died sitting at Angus Tarleton\u2019s desk, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Todd, she did. She sat down\u2014she must have been winded. Like I said, she died there of a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd somebody else died in the house, too,\u201d Todd said. \u201cA couple of years ago.\u201d</p> <p>She inhaled a deep breath. \u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt was really a tragedy. A young college student decided to hack into the alarm system. The police believe he was pledging for a fraternity. He tried to break in and did something wrong with the alarm, and he was electrocuted. Everyone involved with the house was appalled, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd there was another guy. The woman on our ghost tour told us. One of the curators or guides or whatever you\u2019re called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was in 1977. He fell down the steps and broke his neck,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cFell? Or was pushed? I bet Beast Bradley pushed him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Todd. Beast Bradley\u2019s been gone for over two centuries. He\u2019s not hanging around here trying to kill people.\u201d Allison shook her head. \u201cThe house has been here for a long time, and over time, bad things happen.\u201d</p><p>Todd frowned at her. \u201cI think he is. I think he wanted to stay in Philadelphia, and he wanted to marry Lucy Tarleton, but she hated him. So he killed her, but he still didn\u2019t want to leave the house. It was supposed to be his house. So he came back here when he died. And now he kills people!\u201d</p> <p>There was something about the boy\u2019s insistence that made Allison uncomfortable. She loved the house, and she loved working here. She didn\u2019t need this job; she\u2019d gotten her degrees in history and was a college lecturer who also wrote articles and was currently doing research for a book. She worked at the house because she loved the people part of history, loved understanding the realities and nuances of everyday life far more than dates and figures. She\u2019d grown up farther down on Chestnut Street and had admired this place all her life, and as a result she could answer questions that few others could. She\u2019d respected the house, and she\u2019d never wanted to sensationalize it by writing ghost stories. Like any historical place, it had an aura about it. She felt that same aura standing next to the Liberty Bell or when she went into Independence Hall, or any of the sites around the world where people had once lived and passionately taken part in the shaping of destiny. She couldn\u2019t believe that Todd was suddenly making her afraid of this house.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, bad things happen, Todd, and they happen everywhere. That\u2019s why we go through life trying to drive properly, cross the street only when the light is green and take care of our health\u2014because human beings are fragile.\u201d She smiled. \u201cI work here three days a week, and sometimes more, and nothing has ever happened to me. I usually close up by myself, too, and I\u2019m just fine. And I\u2019ve never seen a ghost.\u201d</p><p>Todd looked at her oddly. \u201cHe likes you. He might not always like you, but he likes you right now. He likes women.\u201d</p><p>The way the boy spoke was unsettling, and she told herself he was heading back toward being a raunchy preteen, acting in a manner that was natural for his age.</p><p>His mother walked up to them a moment later. \u201cI\u2019m Todd and Jimmy\u2019s mom, Haley Dixon,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry if the boys have been bothering you. As you\u2019ve probably heard, we did the ghost tour last night. There are all kinds of stories about this place, and they\u2019re boys, and...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Dixon, Todd\u2019s been asking me about the house, and he\u2019s a good listener,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>Haley Dixon smiled at her son. \u201cTodd, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re curious, but we have to leave Ms. Leigh alone and allow her to give everyone her information at the same time.\u201d</p><p>She seemed a pleasant woman, and a good parent, slightly at a loss as to what to do with a couple of boys. Her husband, viewing some of the portraits on the wall, turned. Grinning, he came over to join them, slipping an arm around his wife. \u201cArtie Dixon, Ms. Leigh. You do a wonderful tour. Forgive my sons, please, if they\u2019re too inquisitive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo such thing in this house,\u201d Allison assured him. But she stepped back to include her whole group. \u201cAll right, everyone, gather around and I\u2019ll give you all the grisly details on some of the sad and tragic occurrences here, since it seems the ghost story guides are beating us to it.\u201d</p><p>She told them about the soldiers, then reminded them, \u201cIn the past, many women died in childbirth. It was the norm to have your baby at home, so several of them died here. Many family members died of illness or simply of old age. Remember, all human beings are mortal and leave this world in some fashion!\u201d She tried to speak lightly, looking at Todd. \u201cNow, we\u2019re going down the rear steps to the old food preparation room, and then we\u2019ll head to the back to see the outbuildings.\u201d</p><p>Allison managed to get her group out to the yard. The property still consisted of about an acre, with the majority of the grounds in the back. The kitchen stood off to her left, behind the dining room, with a covered path between them. It was a one-room kitchen, large with a massive hearth and spit and a multitude of rafters from which pans and cooking utensils hung. Glass-frosted cupboards showcased the family\u2019s fine china and several sets of silverware, and one of her group murmured that it was probably the most complete example of an upper-class Colonial kitchen she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>They went across another, broader path to the carriage house. There were no horses now, but there were stalls and tack and three eighteenth-century carriages. As Allison let the group look at them more closely, Haley Dixon came up to her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a ghost horse here, too, or so they said last night,\u201d she told Allison, sounding a little apologetic.</p><p>Allison sighed. \u201cFirewalker. He brought Stewart Douglas racing back to the house, heedless of the British after he heard that Bradley had threatened Lucy. Stewart was the man she really loved. She\u2019d urged him to take the horse after he snuck into the city to see her once, because Firewalker was such an exceptional stallion he could sail through enemy lines. Firewalker was born and bred on the property, and carried Lucy Tarleton on many of her journeys in the middle of the night, when she rode out to bring information to the Revolutionary troops. He survived the war and lived to a ripe old age, then died here in the arms of Lucy\u2019s sister, which means, of course, that we have a ghost horse. We have a ghost hound, too. With the imaginative name of Robert. He was Lucy\u2019s, and when Bradley went to kill her, the hound tried to kill him. Naturally, the dog died, as well. We probably even have haunted squirrels,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>Haley Dixon laughed. \u201cI guess. It\u2019s strange. The house is strange because so much happened in it. I\u2019m not sure I could hang around here alone at night.\u201d</p><p>Allison shrugged, smiling. \u201cYou get used to it, really.\u201d</p><p>She announced to her group that she\u2019d show them the graveyard next.</p><p>The family burial ground was a popular destination. Lucy Tarleton herself lay in a handsome private Tarleton crypt in a beautifully sculpted tomb. Allison described the workmanship and explained that it was common for wealthy families to have their own graveyards. She noted that Todd didn\u2019t want to be in the cemetery; she was shocked to realize that she was anxious to end the tour herself.</p><p>It was finally time to usher her people out, but Allison was still disturbed by the way Todd looked at her as he left with his family. They were the last ones out the back gate, and he lingered. \u201cA ghost can\u2019t follow you home, can it?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I mean, if we do have ghosts, I imagine they\u2019d just hang around here. Have fun tonight! Pinch a tavern wench somewhere, okay?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She\u2019d slap you. But go forth and have fun and be a kid!\u201d</p><p>When they were gone at last, she hurried into the house through the back door. She found Jason Lawrence in their small employee quarters behind the main pantry.</p><p>He had removed his Colonial garb and was wearing jeans and a T-shirt that promoted his favorite band.</p><p>\u201cHey, you holding up okay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019s nice when four people actually work on the busy days,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe could\u2019ve used Julian. I understand why Annette had to go\u2014poor thing. She looked like she was in so much pain.\u201d</p><p>Jason was an attractive young man, about three years her junior at the ripe old age of twenty-four. They\u2019d been friends since they\u2019d met, and although they had great chemistry together, it wasn\u2019t sexual. They were friends. He raised his brows and let out a sigh. \u201cWe may all love him for being a clown and a prankster, but Julian can also be a total pain in the ass,\u201d he said. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s going to get rich and famous\u2014and that we\u2019re all going to be grateful just to have known him. But you have to speak to him or to Sarah or someone else on the board, because this isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try talking to him first,\u201d Allison said. \u201cAnd then, if he doesn\u2019t start acting more responsible, I will talk to Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cMind if I scoot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHot date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to leave you alone...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a run-through and set the alarm as I head out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lock the back door. The back gate\u2019s locked, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I can just hit the alarm and dash out the front.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a kiss on the cheek and she heard his footsteps on the hardwood floor as he went to lock up. She heard him as he moved through the house, and she heard the front door close as he left.</p><p>To her annoyance, she was suddenly frightened in the house. She silently chastised herself. Todd was at the age when he wanted to be a sexual lothario one minute, and a kid spooked by a campfire tale the next. She wanted to rip off her dress and stomacher and change into her comfortable jeans; instead, she decided to hurry up and check the house, then get out of there.</p><p>She glanced over the room and went out, locking the door. She walked past the dining room and the grand salon and returned to the foyer. Looking up the stairs, she knew she wasn\u2019t going up to make sure she\u2019d left no scared toddler or would-be ghost hunter in the house. She knew that every man, woman and child on her tour had departed through the back gate.</p><p>A sense of something dark and evil seemed to have drifted over her, and she wished she could call Jason back. As she crossed the foyer, she stopped.</p><p>She\u2019d heard a sound. A ticking or a...scrape or...</p> <p>It was coming from Angus Tarleton\u2019s study.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to look. She wanted to rush to the front door, hit the alarm and run home, run out of the house screaming....</p><p>How ridiculous!</p><p>It might have been an air-conditioning vent or...wood settling. There were probably dozens of technical or architectural things it could be.</p><p>She closed her eyes, shaking her head, annoyed again that Todd had managed to unnerve her like this. She was a sensible and responsible human being, a historian.</p><p>She walked to the room and looked in.</p> <p>And a scream, shrill and horrified, tore from her throat.</p><p>Julian Mitchell had returned to the Tarleton-Dandridge House.</p><p>2</p><p>Tyler Montague\u2019s first impression of Allison Leigh was not a good one.</p><p>But then, the woman had apparently been at the house where a friend had died\u2014either accidentally or through a very bizarre form of murder\u2014for hours before coming down to the police station to deal with more paperwork.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been accused of murder, not yet. Probably because the police and the pathologists couldn\u2019t quite figure out how a woman her size could have managed it. Julian Mitchell had been big, tall, well-muscled. For her to have dealt with the weapon and the man would have been a nearly impossible feat.</p><p>She had dark hair, so sleek and deep a brown, it appeared black. He assumed she\u2019d started the evening with her hair neatly tied back but now it was tumbling down around her shoulders beneath an eighteenth-century-style mobcap. Allison was dressed in the daily wear of an upscale Revolutionary-era citizen\u2014a robe \u00e0 l\u2019Anglaise, he believed they called the gown\u2014and looked exhausted. She was seated at a table in one of the interrogation rooms, a cup of coffee in front of her, and when he arrived, she had her head down on one arm.</p><p>\u201cMs. Leigh knows you\u2019re coming to talk to her,\u201d a quiet voice said at his side.</p> <p>Tyler turned to look at Adam Harrison. Adam had to be close to eighty, but he walked with the ease of a much younger man and stood straight as a poker. His eyes were a very gentle blue, showing signs of a smoky color that might have come from his age. He had snow-white hair, and his suit was casual and in impeccable taste. He\u2019d arranged for Tyler\u2019s Krewe to be called in because of Ethan Oxford, an old friend of Adam\u2019s with whom he\u2019d served on many philanthropic boards over the years.</p><p>Adam Harrison was the reason Tyler had left a career with the Texas Rangers to join this extremely unusual unit of the FBI.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t know everything about Adam Harrison; he didn\u2019t think anyone did. But Adam seemed to have friends everywhere. A call from him and a rough road could be easily traveled. But then, years before Tyler and his Krewe had ever met the man, Adam Harrison had been putting the right people in the right circumstances. And while other government agencies might consider the Krewe units as something completely separate and even an embarrassment at times, they were respected for their prowess. They had yet to fail when it came to finding the truth in any of their investigations.</p><p>\u201cAnd she knows who I am?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>Harrison shrugged. \u201cShe knows you\u2019re FBI.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must be ready to crawl the walls. It took me a little over three hours to drive in from northern Virginia, and we didn\u2019t receive your call until an hour or so after the body was discovered.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s after midnight.\u201d</p><p>Harrison sighed, shuffling his feet slightly. \u201cThe police were left with no recourse, really. There was the dead man. There was the woman who called it in. Tour groups had been at the house all evening, along with a couple of other docents, and when Ms. Leigh dialed 9-1-1, she was the only one on the premises. She was shaken when they got there. With a death of this nature, you have to be suspicious of anyone in her situation. The sad thing is that I believe she\u2019s entirely innocent. And she\u2019s just lost a colleague.\u201d</p><p>Tyler saw that Harrison\u2019s empathy for the young woman was strong.</p><p>\u201cDid she suggest a ghost killed him?\u201d Tyler asked skeptically.</p><p>Harrison didn\u2019t look at him; he continued to look through the one-way glass at the young woman. \u201cNo. Ms. Leigh\u2014technically Dr. Leigh\u2014is a professor, historian and scholar. She teaches history at the university, except that she\u2019s off for the summer. She also writes papers. Even when she\u2019s teaching, she gives tours at the house, but the point is\u2014she does not believe in ghosts.\u201d He spoke with a grimace. Her feelings on that might change in the near future.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see her, get her out of here and then read up on everything that\u2019s happened in the house,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t charging her, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they made the right call in asking her to come down here,\u201d Adam told him. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you over and introduce you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know her? Or you just met her?\u201d</p><p>Harrison smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve made it my business for many years to meet and greet politicians and those in law enforcement and, thankfully, many remain grateful for help they\u2019ve received. I was here when the house hosted a dinner for up-and-coming men and women in the city, sponsored by municipal leaders. Ms. Leigh was very charming and of great assistance in arranging the evening. I think you\u2019ll find that she can tell you more than you\u2019ll read in most history books. So, we\u2019re not best friends, but yes, I know her.\u201d</p><p>The door to the observation room opened just then, and a middle-aged man with fine, intelligent eyes and a bloodhound\u2019s weary jowls walked in. Tyler had already met him; he was Detective Jenson, assigned to the \u201csuspicious\u201d death.</p><p>\u201cAll the paperwork for the evening is complete. Ms. Leigh may leave whenever you\u2019re ready. Agent Montague, you wanted to go to the house tonight?\u201d Jenson asked.</p><p>Tyler nodded. \u201cI\u2019d like to get in while the evidence is still fresh.\u201d</p><p>Whatever Jenson thought of the \u201cspecial\u201d FBI unit that had been brought in, he didn\u2019t let his feelings show. \u201cThe crime scene people have just finished up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been in there for about six hours collecting everything they can, but, of course, the house is a tourist location so they have hundreds if not thousands of prints. I\u2019ll get you Ms. Leigh\u2019s key to the house and the code to bypass the security system,\u201d he told Tyler. \u201cAnd, needless to say, we\u2019d appreciate it if you shared any findings with us immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find anything without the help of the police,\u201d Tyler said, \u201cso, yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Judging by his quick smile, Jenson seemed to like that. \u201cYou\u2019re free to speak with Ms. Leigh.\u201d He glanced at Adam. \u201cAnd get her home.\u201d</p><p>Adam thanked him. They left the observation area and entered the interrogation room.</p><p>Allison Leigh sat up stiffly, regarding Tyler with narrowed eyes that gentled as she looked at Adam Harrison.</p><p>The man just had a way about him.</p><p>\u201cAllison, I\u2019d like you to meet Agent Tyler Montague. He\u2019s here to investigate the situation\u2014and the Tarleton-Dandridge House,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Allison Leigh gave Tyler a long cool assessment. \u201cThe house?\u201d she asked skeptically. \u201cThe house caused Julian to slit his throat on his bayonet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ve been a number of incidents at the house, Ms. Leigh,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Allison turned to Adam. \u201cHe believes he can arrest the ghost of a Revolutionary soldier?\u201d</p><p>Tyler answered. \u201cNo, Ms. Leigh. But the number of strange occurrences at the house, especially in recent years, suggest that someone who\u2019s alive and well is playing deadly pranks. Actually, we\u2019re here to see you home if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, and Tyler thought her hostility toward him had relaxed somewhat. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to ask me to go through everything that happened again?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d rather you went through the house with me. If you\u2019re up to it, that is. Otherwise, we\u2019ll take you home, as I said.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, then blinked. He could see her mind working, and it was fascinating to watch the emotions that flashed through her beautiful if red-rimmed eyes. She\u2019d been up for hours; she\u2019d just lost a colleague, possibly a friend. She\u2019d been in the interrogation room forever. She wanted a drink or simply to collapse for a while and forget the horror she\u2019d witnessed.</p><p>But he also knew that she understood why he needed to see the house now, as quickly after the event as possible. She didn\u2019t want to go back and see where her friend had died, but she understood that anything that might be discovered would be most easily found before too much time had elapsed.</p><p>She lifted her hands. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said with a nod. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d she asked Adam, her voice hopeful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you wish, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Tyler admired the effect Adam had on others. He knew that Harrison had once had a son, Josh, and that Josh had been killed in an accident at a young age. Josh had apparently been born with a sixth sense, and when he\u2019d died, Adam had spent years trying to reach him. Tyler had recently heard that the father could finally talk to the son, although Adam didn\u2019t usually have the ability to communicate with the dead.</p> <p>What he did have was an uncanny ability to connect with the living.</p><p>Tyler definitely wished he had a little more of that ability himself. He wasn\u2019t sure why he seemed to lack it. Maybe it was his height, which people often considered intimidating, since he stood at about six-five. From the time he was a kid, he\u2019d wanted nothing but to be a Texas Ranger and now, although he loved the change in what he was doing, he wondered if he carried some kind of aura from the years he\u2019d spent working in tough areas of Texas. He didn\u2019t know if it was his appearance or his no-nonsense demeanor, but people seemed to find him imposing, and it always took him a while to convince them that he wasn\u2019t a swaggering, gun-toting cowboy.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s get going,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI know you must be emotionally drained, my dear, but we\u2019ll get you home soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? I can just walk out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>She stood, a bit clumsily. Tyler saw that she was a respectable height for a woman, maybe five-eight or nine, and that she wore the historic dress exceptionally well. She seemed fragile for a second, as if she\u2019d been sitting too long and couldn\u2019t quite find her feet. She didn\u2019t shake him off when he touched her, but she said regally, \u201cThank you. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>He released her elbow and they exited the station. Detective Jenson was waiting for them at the precinct door. \u201cThank you, Ms. Leigh. Thank you for your patience with us. And please accept my deepest sympathies.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIf I can do anything, provide any more information...\u201d She paused. They\u2019d already kept her long enough to glean anything she was likely to know.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s SUV was just outside the station and he nodded toward it. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you home as quickly as we can,\u201d he promised.</p><p>Adam politely ushered Allison into the passenger seat and took the rear himself, insisting that even at his age, he\u2019d show courtesy to a lady until he keeled over.</p><p>Although he was silent during the drive, Allison began to speak. \u201cIt seemed like such an ordinary day,\u201d she murmured.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of tours?\u201d Tyler asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, it was busy, which is good. We work hard to make the tours interesting and informative, and to keep the house sustaining itself.\u201d</p><p>Tyler asked a few questions about historical tours as he drove, trying to put her at ease. They reached the house, parking in the adjacent lot.</p><p>Maybe it was fitting that there\u2019d be a full moon that night. The house seemed large and alive in the light, encased by the shadows surrounding it.</p><p>By day, he thought, it was probably a handsome Colonial house, built to withstand the ages. But now...</p><p>Now it seemed as if it were waiting.</p><p>There were warnings posted by the police. No Trespassing! Invasion of the Premises in Any Manner Will Result in Immediate Arrest!</p><p>The warnings covered the sign beyond the podium that usually advertised the property\u2019s hours of admission and the prices of tours.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s\u2014there\u2019s tape all over the house.\u201d Allison spoke blankly, obviously too tired to be shocked.</p><p>\u201cYes, your chairman has ordered the house closed for a few weeks, long enough for a real investigation,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Tyler slipped a knife from his jacket pocket to cut through the tape. He keyed in the code on the gate alarm.</p><p>\u201cA real investigation?\u201d Allison repeated.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find out if the security\u2019s been breached and determine whether there\u2019s another access. Also, if there\u2019s someone who knows the code and has dangerous concepts of history, dangerous beliefs about this house. That\u2019s why it merits investigation.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s eyes narrowed again as she studied him. \u201cYou\u2019re a ghost hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a ghost hunter\u2014I\u2019m an agent,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cHunting ghosts would be a rather useless effort.\u201d He forced a smile. \u201cThey only appear when they choose to. Inviting conversation\u2014now, that\u2019s another thing.\u201d</p><p>Leaving her to Adam, he strolled up the walkway. He wanted to spend some time in the house alone.</p><p>At the front door he once again slit the tape before typing in the alarm code and using the key he\u2019d received from Detective Jenson to let himself in. When he entered the foyer, it felt as if he\u2019d stepped back in time.</p><p>Tyler stood there for a minute. You didn\u2019t need to be a Krewe member to \u201cfeel\u201d a house, a battlefield or any other historic place. He\u2019d seen the most skeptical, steel-souled Texas Ranger take on a look of grim reverence when standing at the Alamo. It was a feeling that touched most people on the battlefields at Gettysburg or in the middle of Westminster Abbey, Notre Dame or other such historic places.</p><p>This house had it. That feeling. It was a sense of the past, a past that was somehow still present. Perhaps the energy, passion and emotion of life that had once existed here lingered in these rooms.</p><p>This was a beautiful house and maintained in a period manner that no doubt added to the feel.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t stay in the entry long. He could hear Adam and Allison following behind him, Adam explaining that what they investigated was history rather than ghosts.</p><p>He knew that Julian Mitchell\u2019s death had occurred in the old study, and he strode down the hallway toward it. He stared at the old maple desk; blood stained the wood and the Persian rug beneath it where the deceased man had been found. A few spatters lay on the reproduction ledgers and account books covering the desk. Initial contact with the blade had caused a spurt, and the blood had drained straight down. A lot of it.</p><p>Tyler tried to picture the scene as it had been described to him\u2014the young man seated in the chair, the musket between his legs, the bayonet through his throat and mouth as if he\u2019d used it to prop himself up. He had bled out quickly, according to the pathologist who\u2019d first examined him. He hadn\u2019t appeared distressed and he didn\u2019t appear to have fought with anyone. He had simply sat down, set his chin upon the bayonet as though to rest on it...and skewered himself with it.</p><p>Who the hell accidentally put a bayonet blade through his own chin?</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t cried out. Tourists leaving the premises would have heard or, at the very least, Allison Leigh would have as she locked up for the night.</p><p>Tyler remained near the entrance to the room, noting its location. There was the door that opened off the entry hall, and another that led from the study to the next room. This meant there were two points of access, as well as a way to exit.</p><p>But how did you get someone to die on a bayonet in such a position and leave no sign of a struggle? Talk him into it?</p><p>He looked at the paintings on the wall, which were authentic period pieces. Two men had been depicted at somewhere between the ages of thirty and forty. Beneath one, he made out the name Angus Tarleton; the other was labeled with the description Brian \u201cBeast\u201d Bradley.</p><p>The eyes of the latter seemed to have an unusual power. The artist had managed to depict a handsome man\u2014and also a cruel and cunning one. He\u2019d read that the Mona Lisa\u2019s eyes seemed to follow her viewers. Bradley\u2019s did the same, apparently focusing on him as he moved about the room.</p><p>He turned to the hallway. Allison Leigh was pale as she stood next to Adam, who watched and waited for Tyler to take the lead.</p><p>\u201cAllison, can you tell me exactly what happened leading up to your discovery of Julian?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She winced. \u201cI should\u2019ve written it down earlier, I\u2019ve had to repeat it so many times,\u201d she muttered. She was hostile again, he thought. Hostile and angry, but that was good. If she\u2019d fallen apart, broken into tears, she wouldn\u2019t have been much help.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t run into a bloodthirsty ghost,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve been surprised if you had,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you do want to catch the killer, right?\u201d</p><p>She stared back at him with eyes that were as clear and beautiful as a summer sky.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think there was a killer,\u201d she said. \u201cJulian could be a clown. He was full of himself, an entertainer. He had a tendency to piss the rest of us off with his unwillingness to accept responsibility, but he also made us laugh and...he was a friend.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cIt looked as if he sat down, started fooling around with the musket and set his head right on the blade. Yes, we use real muskets and bayonets, and never, ever, have we had a problem. The costumed interpreters don\u2019t carry bullets or gunpowder and no one\u2019s ever gone crazy and tried to bayonet a tourist. Who\u2019d imagine that anyone could die on one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in any way suicidal?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cJulian? He was convinced the world was waiting for him,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe he committed suicide.\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cWe were all angry with him, figuring he\u2019d had some kind of great offer and decided just to disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was supposed to be working\u2014and he wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Well, he showed up for the morning tours. He took off after lunch, probably for an audition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you found him in his period costume?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe was with a bar band that had higher aspirations. They did a lot of auditioning and sometimes they had permits to play in the historic areas, so it wasn\u2019t uncommon for him to stay in his work clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut none of you saw him after lunch?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAre there places in the house where he could\u2019ve been and you wouldn\u2019t see him?\u201d Tyler asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She glanced at him. \u201cA closet?\u201d There was a hint of sarcasm in her voice. \u201cOr,\u201d she said, her tone serious, \u201cthe attic. We don\u2019t go up to the attic with any of the tour groups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I see it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Adam suggested.</p><p>Allison seemed to go back into tour-guide mode as she led the way. She pointed out the ladies\u2019 parlor, the music room and, across the entry, the dining room and parlor. As they walked up the first flight of stairs she talked about the owners of the house and the bedrooms used by the family\u2014and by the British invaders.</p><p>Tyler paused at Lucy Tarleton\u2019s bedroom; from the doorway he\u2019d noticed another painting of Beast Bradley.</p><p>It was different from the one in the study. The light of cruelty wasn\u2019t apparent in the eyes. He\u2019d been depicted in a more thoughtful mood, his eyes conveying wisdom and strength rather than cruelty.</p><p>\u201cOne more floor to the attic,\u201d Allison said. \u201cIf you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m curious about this painting,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Beast Bradley. I don\u2019t really know why the painting\u2019s in here. Bradley took over the master bedroom while he was in residence at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a nice painting of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he had friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting that the foundation chose to keep the painting here, since he moved into the master bedroom,\u201d Tyler commented.</p><p>\u201cThe house was owned by the family until it was turned into a nonprofit institution,\u201d Allison said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the painting was. The board determined to keep everything as it was, getting rid of modern additions and buying a few authentic pieces to bring it back to the Revolutionary period. But in the 1930s, when the work was being done, the painting was in Lucy\u2019s bedroom and the board at the time decided to keep it there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdding insult to injury for poor Lucy. The original family must be rolling in their graves,\u201d Tyler said. He tried to keep any irony from his voice.</p><p>A derisive sound escaped her. The expression might be a common one, but in her world, people did not roll in their graves.</p><p>Some old houses had stairs that were pulled down for access to the attic. Not the Tarleton-Dandridge House. At the end of the upper hallway he saw a staircase leading to the door; a sign on it read Staff Only! He assumed the door was usually locked, and he was right.</p><p>\u201cThe front door key opens the attic, as well,\u201d Allison explained.</p><p>He used the key and pushed the door open. It led to a few more stairs. He climbed them and found himself standing on the attic level of the house. It was dark up here, but the moonlight and streetlamps offered some relief from the black shadows as his eyes grew accustomed to the change.</p><p>Someone had been there. Someone had tossed the place, rummaging through the old boxes and trunks and the modern equipment that had sat on a desk. A computer lay on the floor, along with a printer. Letters and correspondence were everywhere and, scattered among them, posters for special events and other paraphernalia.</p><p>\u201cMy God!\u201d Allison breathed.</p><p>Tyler turned to Adam. \u201cWe need to get the crime scene techs back here. I doubt we\u2019ll find fingerprints other than those that belong here, but you never know.\u201d</p> <p>Adam nodded and pulled out his cell phone.</p><p>Allison continued to stare at the mess. She seemed almost punch-drunk, as if the day itself had just been way too long. He empathized with her, even if she considered him an oversize caricature of a slime-seeking ghost buster.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be here shortly,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh.\u201d Moaning, Allison sank down to the floor, her period dress drifting in a bell around her.</p><p>It was natural that the death of Julian Mitchell drew headlines across the country.</p><p>He had died in a historic home\u2014a \u201chaunted\u201d house, according to just about everyone\u2014and whether or not people believed in ghosts, it was undeniably a house riddled with tragic history.</p><p>Allison saw the headline minutes after she woke the next morning. She still had a newspaper delivered each day. She loved flipping leisurely through real pages while she drank her coffee.</p><p>As she picked up the paper, she felt tears stinging her eyes again. Julian had often been a jerk, but he\u2019d still been a coworker and a friend. She blinked hard and realized how exhausted she was. She\u2019d spent most of the night with the police. She was still horrified that they saw Julian\u2019s death as \u201csuspicious\u201d and knew that any suspicions of murder certainly included her. After all, she\u2019d found him. She couldn\u2019t believe the number of hours she\u2019d spent at the station and then at the house when the crime scene techs had arrived again.</p><p>She glanced over at the clock\u2014it was already eleven, and she still felt exhausted. It was a good thing the house was closed down until it had been \u201cinvestigated.\u201d She couldn\u2019t begin to offer a tour today, and she was glad she didn\u2019t have a crowded schedule in the coming semester, just a few lectures. She felt numb about history, even though it was the love of her life. Rich and giving and...</p><p>Taking. It had somehow taken Julian\u2019s life. She didn\u2019t understand how or why, but she sensed that the past had something to do with it. She\u2019d claimed that his death had to be an accident. And yet...</p><p>Allison set the paper on the counter of her small house on Chestnut Street and walked over to the coffee machine, popping a pod in place and waiting the few seconds for it to brew.</p><p>The coffee tasted delicious. She figured she needed about a gallon of it. She\u2019d been at the Tarleton-Dandridge until nearly 3:00 a.m., when one of the officers had driven her home.</p><p>She wished she could\u2019ve slept the entire day, and then thought she should just be grateful she hadn\u2019t had horrible dreams, considering how Julian had looked....</p><p>A shower seemed in order, although she\u2019d taken one the night before. A psychiatrist would probably tell her she was trying to wash away what she\u2019d seen but she didn\u2019t care. It might make her feel more human. Or at least more awake.</p><p>While the water streamed over her, she thought about Julian and let her tears flow. She thought about the many times they\u2019d been ready to smack him for his lack of responsibility or for leaving one of them in the lurch. It didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d still been a friend. Worse, it was such a ridiculous way to die.</p><p>When she\u2019d first found him, after the initial horror and disbelief, she wondered if he\u2019d sat there to play a prank on her, maybe planning to apologize for disappearing. Maybe he\u2019d tell her he\u2019d gotten the gig of a lifetime because he\u2019d taken off that afternoon.</p><p>It had never occurred to her that anyone had killed him. His death had looked like a tragic, stupid accident. And that was terrible enough, but...</p><p>Why would anyone kill Julian Mitchell, and why would that person go up to the attic and trash everything there?</p><p>And how had it happened with her and Jason in the house, not to mention the thirty or so people in their tour groups?</p><p>She\u2019d barely dressed and her hair was still dripping when her doorbell rang. She cringed, not wanting to see anyone, but curiosity got the better of her and she walked to the door to look through the peephole.</p><p>It was the Texas ghost buster.</p><p>She watched him as she ignored the buzzer. He rang again.</p><p>He didn\u2019t go away.</p><p>She considered it bizarre that the police had called in the FBI\u2014and that they\u2019d called in this unit. Allison had to admit she didn\u2019t know that much about the FBI or the \u201cKrewe of Hunters,\u201d but she\u2019d checked the internet when she first met Adam Harrison and read that they were a special unit sent in when circumstances were unusual. Unusual meant that something paranormal might be going on, or seemed to be going on, and it appalled Allison that a historic property like the Tarleton-Dandridge House could be turned into a supernatural oddity. Of course, the ghost tours in the city loved the house and the tales that went with it, but those tours were for fun. And that kind of fun was great as long as it didn\u2019t detract from the real wonders of Philadelphia.</p><p>All the information she could find about Adam\u2014or his Krewes\u2014seemed to have plenty of read-between-the-lines suggestions that there was something out of the ordinary about them. From what she could gather, the Krewes were well acquainted with the paranormal and made use of strange communications in solving crimes. No way could she buy into that!</p><p>Peering out at Tyler Montague seemed to make it all the more ludicrous. He looked as if he should be in a barbarian movie; he was tall as a house and built with pure, lean muscle. How could such a man believe in ghosts?</p><p>He had waited a respectable amount of time. He rang the bell again.</p><p>With a sigh, Allison threw the door open. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI need your help.\u201d</p><p>She turned and walked back through her house toward the counter that divided the kitchen from the living area. \u201cWith what? Do you need a cup of coffee? That I have. Do you want to know about the Tarleton ghosts? Can\u2019t help you there. I\u2019ve never seen them. Oh, and I suppose I should mention this\u2014I don\u2019t believe they exist. We have a shot at life, then we die. Period. I believe in God as an entity seen by different people in different ways, but I don\u2019t think He has an open-door policy in heaven, saying, Hey, come and go as you please. But coffee? I\u2019ve got that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could use a cup,\u201d he said mildly, following her inside and closing the door. He walked to the counter as she placed another pod in her coffeemaker. She turned to look at him, hoping\u2014to her surprise\u2014that her house was clean and neat. She had the feeling that, ghost hunter or no, he was observant and perhaps judging her character through her living space.</p><p>\u201cThings might be a bit messy,\u201d she said, sweeping out an arm that indicated the sections of newspaper strewn on the table and her shoes and cape thrown on a chair. \u201cSorry. Long night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks pretty good to me,\u201d he commented.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like in your coffee? Oh, and what are you doing here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t answer my question about the coffee. What do you want in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust black, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. A fed from Texas. Black coffee.\u201d She handed him the cup, asking, \u201cWhat do you need from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInformation about the people you work with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone fills out an extensive form in order to work at the house, and then has to pass an oral exam. Guides have to know what they\u2019re doing. Believe it or not, the place gets a lot of applications. When the board hires, they want people who not only have a good grasp of history, but really love it. So they ask personal questions, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m aware of all that. What I want to hear is more about what you\u2019ve seen. What you, personally, have observed.\u201d</p><p>She paused, eyes narrowing. \u201cYou think one of my coworkers had something to do with this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Julian Mitchell went crazy, trashed his workplace, then sat down and killed himself on a bayonet\u2014no.\u201d</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve been through it and through it, with you and with the cops. I don\u2019t know what else I could possibly tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart with your day,\u201d he told her. \u201cTell me about it again.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt was pretty much like any other day,\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a sip of his coffee, smiling. \u201cI was looking for a little more detail than that. Were any of the tours unusual? Did anything stand out to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I found the body of a friend in the study,\u201d she said curtly.</p> <p>Before he could respond, his cell phone rang. He excused himself and answered it, frowning as he listened.</p><p>Allison felt a chill; she knew it had something to do with whatever was being said.</p><p>A moment later he hung up. \u201cYou took a family with two boys, Todd and Jimmy, on your last tour.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir father\u2019s in the hospital. He woke up in the middle of the night, screamed and fell into a coma. One of the kids was so hysterical when they reached the hospital that someone on staff called the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? That\u2019s terrible, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy, Todd, wants to talk to you. He said that you\u2019d understand. According to Todd, a ghost did follow them home.\u201d</p><p>3</p> <p>The hospital was cold. Outside, the late-summer heat was beginning to wane and the day was still beautiful, but inside the hospital, Allison shivered against the chill that seeped into her bones.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be there; she wanted to run away. But Todd wanted to see her because for some reason he believed she could help.</p><p>And she wanted to help.</p><p>The two boys were seated in an otherwise empty waiting area. Todd\u2019s mother was in with his father, and an attractive woman of about forty was sitting with the boys. Seeing Allison, Todd leaped to his feet and came running over to her. She was startled when he threw his arms around her but she comforted the boy, embracing him and stroking his hair.</p><p>\u201cHe followed us home! He followed us home. That awful man followed us home. The beast\u2014Beast Bradley. He killed your friend and he made my father sick!\u201d Todd said, his words muffled.</p><p>Allison looked helplessly at the woman in the room and then at Tyler Montague.</p><p>\u201cTodd,\u201d she said gently. \u201cGhosts can\u2019t do that. Really. They\u2019re just...inventions, something we make up in our own minds. Your father\u2014\u201d She paused, praying this wasn\u2019t a lie. \u201cYour father\u2019s going to be fine. You\u2019re in an exceptionally good hospital and the doctors will find out what\u2019s wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>The woman who was with the boys had risen and come toward her, a hand extended. \u201cYou must be Allison Leigh. I\u2019m Rose Litton, Todd and Jimmy\u2019s aunt. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been asked down here. I know you\u2019re dealing with your own loss. But Todd was nearly hysterical and insisted that he see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s quite all right,\u201d Allison assured her. But it wasn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t know how to make this better for Todd.</p><p>She could only be glad that\u2014as far as she knew\u2014the ransacking of the attic\u2019s office space had not been divulged to the media.</p><p>\u201cWhat do the doctors say?\u201d Tyler was asking.</p><p>\u201cSo far they can\u2019t identify the physiological cause,\u201d Rose Litton said. \u201cNot yet, at any rate, but they\u2019re doing a lot of tests. Early this morning, while he was still in bed at the hotel, Artie jerked up, screamed\u2014and fell into a coma. It was as if he saw something in his sleep...or in his dreams. They believe he might have ingested some kind of hallucinogenic, which made him see something that terrified him, although they can\u2019t tell what it is or how this might have happened. They just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Allison touched Todd\u2019s chin to get him to look up at her. \u201cThe doctors here are the best. They\u2019ll find out what\u2019s wrong with your father,\u201d she promised again.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Rose Litton asked, frowning at Tyler. \u201cForgive me\u2014that\u2019s rude. I just knew the nurse had called the police station, asking about a way for Todd to see Ms. Leigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot rude at all,\u201d Tyler said, reaching into his jacket and producing his credentials.</p><p>\u201cSpecial Agent?\u201d Rose Litton read, her voice worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to discover what went on at the house,\u201d he told her. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t be alarmed. We don\u2019t suspect any kind of true toxin. Allison would be ill, too, if there had been, and so could a hundred-plus other people who were in the house yesterday. I\u2019m not a doctor, but I do know there are many reasons for a coma, and the doctors here will get to the root of it.\u201d He hunkered down. \u201cDid you see what happened? Perhaps, earlier, your father knocked his head? Was he agitated, stressed out about anything?\u201d</p><p>Todd shook his head. Jimmy stood and came over to join them. \u201cNo, my dad doesn\u2019t get stressed,\u201d Jimmy said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good guy. He yells sometimes, but not much. We had fun after we left the house. We went to a tavern for supper and Dad was okay when we went to bed.\u201d</p><p>Todd nodded vigorously. \u201cYeah, he was fine. He let us watch TV for a while in the hotel. Then we fell asleep and woke up because Dad screamed. He just screamed in the middle of the night. We were scared \u2019cause Dad never screams and suddenly he did.\u201d He looked proud for a minute. \u201cMy dad is really brave. It had to be something awful, a monster like Beast Bradley, to make my dad scream like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tyler said gravely. He stood again. \u201cYou know, sometimes we have monsters in our minds, in our imaginations. I\u2019ll go speak with one of the docs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meantime, you shouldn\u2019t worry.\u201d He smiled at Rose and set his hand on Todd\u2019s head. \u201cExcuse me. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>He left them, and Allison felt more awkward than ever.</p><p>She tried to smile at Rose. \u201cIt\u2019s great that you could be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only over in Hershey,\u201d Rose said. \u201cNot far at all. And I\u2019m glad to be with the boys.\u201d Her expression was pained, her eyes on Allison. Her silence seemed to say a lot.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the matter with Todd. He\u2019s convinced it\u2019s something from the Tarleton-Dandridge House. I hope you can reassure him....</p><p>The realization that this might have been a bad time to bother Allison seemed to come back to her.</p><p>\u201cI really am so sorry!\u201d Rose said. \u201cYou lost someone last night. Tragically. It\u2019s...it\u2019s all over the news. And they\u2019re making it sound\u2014\u201d she glanced at the boys \u201c\u2014like a...well, paranormal event.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cOf course. People love ghost stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a ghost,\u201d Todd insisted.</p><p>Jimmy gasped. \u201cWe saw that a tour guide died at the house. It was on the TV news when we got back. My parents were worried. They hoped it wasn\u2019t you!\u201d he told Allison. \u201cDad turned the news off. He says we\u2019ll get to know enough about the real world when we\u2019re older.\u201d He frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I mean, I\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t you, but I\u2019m sorry about your friend.\u201d</p><p>Todd took her hand and squeezed it. They were sorry, but Julian was an abstraction to them, a news story, while their father was lying here in a no-man\u2019s-land. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re really sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m the one who found him, and it was heartbreaking for me. I\u2019m going to miss him very much. But, Todd, like I was telling you, bad things just happen sometimes, even to good people. Listen, you have to trust the doctors here, and you can\u2019t get upset about the house or believe you have a ghost with you. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her stubbornly. \u201cThe ghost likes you. You can talk to him. You can get him to leave my dad alone.\u201d</p><p>As Allison struggled for speech, Rose Litton shrugged apologetically.</p><p>\u201cAll of us, every one of us, will do whatever we can for your dad, okay, Todd?\u201d Allison finally said.</p><p>Todd whispered a solemn \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Tyler returned. He offered Todd an encouraging smile. \u201cThey\u2019ll keep at it, young man. Meanwhile, you stay calm and help your mom and little brother.\u201d</p><p>Todd nodded. He studied Tyler, and then apparently decided to trust him.</p><p>\u201cI will. I\u2019m going to help my mom and my family,\u201d Todd said. \u201cPlease, help her, though,\u201d he said, glancing over at Allison. \u201cThe ghost likes her.\u201d</p><p>Rose moved closer to Allison. \u201cI am so sorry,\u201d she said again. \u201cHe was just crying and going crazy, and the idea that you might talk to him was the only thing that worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can from our end, Todd,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Allison noticed that the boy seemed to respond to him. He nodded. \u201cI can reach you if I need to, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here,\u201d Tyler promised firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll even give you my personal cell number. You can call me anytime.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Todd gestured at Allison. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she can help us, and you can help her. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can, buddy.\u201d</p><p>He wrote down his cell number and handed it to the boy, then took Allison\u2019s arm to lead her from the hospital. She steeled herself not to wrench her arm out of his grasp.</p> <p>When they exited, she moved away from him. \u201cThat was wrong,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made that poor boy think we could help him by convincing a ghost to leave his dad alone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you believe they exist!\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019d reached his car. He leaned against the roof, looking over at her as she waited by the passenger door.</p><p>\u201cI went in and spoke with Mr. Dixon\u2019s doctors. There is absolutely nothing physiological causing his problem\u2014nothing they can discover. Of course, they\u2019re still testing. And he may come out of it himself. One of the theories his primary physician has is that he put himself in the coma to avoid some horrible fact or illusion he\u2019d seen in his own mind. Whether you want to believe I\u2019m a quack or not, you have to admit that the power of the human mind can be incredible. Maybe if we look into this and find something to say to the kid, the family or even Mr. Dixon himself, we can reverse the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we can find something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the history and the house better than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Allison lowered her eyes, remembering the way she\u2019d felt when Todd was in the house yesterday, so convinced that something evil was still alive there.</p><p>She looked back at Tyler. \u201cI\u2019m an academic. I believe in the power of men and women to do good or evil. I don\u2019t believe in spirits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you believe in history?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You can\u2019t not believe in history,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAh, but what about the famous saying: History is written by the victors. And sometimes the victors might exaggerate or lie or leave things out. Sometimes history has to be rewritten. It isn\u2019t an unchanging, monolithic entity. Attitudes change, and they change history. So do new facts as they emerge.\u201d</p><p>Allison sighed, wondering how the granite Texan could be so ethereal in his statements.</p><p>\u201cHistory didn\u2019t kill Julian Mitchell,\u201d she said. \u201cOr put Mr. Dixon in a coma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelief is everything,\u201d he countered. \u201cAnd, Allison, I do believe it\u2019s obvious that something is going on. Even if by some remarkable chance Julian accidentally killed himself or just decided, Hmm, let me think of a really gruesome way to kill myself, it still wouldn\u2019t explain what happened in the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Julian trashed the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he have done that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Why would he have sat down with his rifle\u2014and then leaned his head down on the blade?\u201d she asked wearily.</p><p>\u201cThose are things we have to know. Other people could die,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean Mr. Dixon. He wasn\u2019t at the house when he went into a coma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But he\u2019d been at the house, and you found a friend dead there a matter of hours earlier. Dixon saw the news about Julian\u2019s death before going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he dreamed a ghost had followed him home and it was so real and frightening to his sleeping mind that he slipped into another realm,\u201d Allison said. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answers to any of it. I just know that it\u2019s real and horrible and I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t think. Will you take me home, please?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019d just like to be alone.\u201d</p><p>He looked over the top of the car at her and Allison saw that his gaze was filled with disappointment. Of course. He wasn\u2019t going to get what he wanted. But it was more than that; it was disappointment in her, and somehow that was disturbing.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. I\u2019ll take you right home.\u201d</p><p>Allison had no idea why his reaction bothered her. It just did.</p><p>\u201cI really need some time!\u201d she said, almost pleading. \u201cJulian is dead. Not in a coma. There\u2019s no coming back from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI completely understand. Really.\u201d</p><p>She slid into the passenger seat. He was silent as they drove and she watched him, feeling a clash of emotions. Life had become so painful and intense overnight. It was still hard to fathom that Julian was dead. She was still tired from last night. She\u2019d discovered the body of her friend. Then she\u2019d dealt\u2014for the first time in her life\u2014with the police, and with crime scene techs trying to find out what she\u2019d touched and what she hadn\u2019t. Later Adam Harrison and this man had shown up... And today she\u2019d spent time with a heartbroken child. She was mentally and physically exhausted, and dismayed because she was disappointing a stranger. And now, she was staring at that stranger, wondering how someone with such a strong jawline and intense eyes, such a tall, powerful build and compelling presence, could be part of a team of ghost busters.</p><p>Yesterday she\u2019d been herself\u2014a teacher who loved history and brought that love to costumed interpretation. She loved her life, and she had good friends, a great family. And this morning...</p><p>She looked straight ahead. She wasn\u2019t being selfish. She needed to go home. To speak with her coworkers and friends from the board and\u2014 Good Lord! She had to call her parents and let them know she was all right.</p><p>He drove to her house and stopped the car. Turning to her, he said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry about your friend, and truly sorry that you were the one to find him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI just need some time,\u201d she said again.</p><p>\u201cCall me when you feel you want to get back into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He was watching her so intently she wondered if she had food on her face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need my number,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d She gave a deep sigh. \u201cI do want to help the kids. I do want to help you, even though it did look like a horrible accident.\u201d Allison took out her cell phone as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cThe trashing of the attic wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d He removed his phone from his pocket. \u201cI\u2019ll dial you,\u201d he said.</p><p>He already had her number. Of course. He was an FBI agent.</p><p>She clicked on the call and added his number to her phone. Then she realized she\u2019d asked to be taken home and they\u2019d arrived, but she was still sitting in his car.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I can do for you,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019re here, Mr. Harrison is here, the police have been through it all. I don\u2019t know what I could contribute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that anyone is as familiar with the house or its history as you are.\u201d She caught herself studying the color of his eyes. They were a mixture of blue and green, a kind of aqua she\u2019d never seen before. He was a very striking man.</p><p>She blinked, suddenly aware that she was staring and that she needed to reply.</p><p>\u201cThere have been some tragic and terrible incidents at the house, but I don\u2019t think something that happened years ago could have any bearing on what happened yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, smiling wryly. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ll find out.\u201d He exited the car and walked around to open her door.</p><p>She remembered that she was supposed to get out.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be right alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thanks. We\u2019ll, um, be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said with a nod.</p><p>Awkwardly, she started up her front walk. She knew he was watching her, and when she fit her key into the door, she turned around to wave. He waved back, then got into his car and eased out onto the street.</p><p>Inside the house, she closed the door and leaned against it for a moment. She\u2019d wanted to be alone.</p><p>Now she didn\u2019t.</p><p>But she walked in and dug out her phone before tossing her purse on the sofa and sitting down next to it. She had to start returning calls.</p><p>But even as she decided that she had to call her mother first and then the board and her coworkers, the silence in the house seemed to weigh down on her. She got up and turned on the television. A news station was playing, with a reporter standing in front of the hospital. Mr. Dixon\u2019s strange fall into a coma was being added to the tragic news about musician and tour guide Julian Mitchell.</p><p>She changed the channel. The speculation on the \u201cevil\u201d within the house on news stations struck her as overkill.</p><p>With a comedy repeat keeping her company, she looked at all the calls she\u2019d ignored while she was with Tyler Montague. She called her parents, who\u2019d gone to their home in Arizona for a few weeks, and made a point of being calm and sad and completely in control. As much as she adored her mom and dad, she didn\u2019t want them coming back here because they were worried about her.</p><p>They\u2019d met Julian a few times and offered their condolences, but when they questioned her safety, she made it sound as if the media were going wild\u2014which they were\u2014and described what had happened as a tragic accident. She assured her mother that as a Revolution-era woman or even as Lucy Tarleton, she didn\u2019t carry a musket with a bayonet.</p><p>Next she spoke to Nathan Pierson. She told him she was fine, and he promised he\u2019d be there for anything she needed with the police or the house. He\u2019d talk to the rest of the board, too. She didn\u2019t have to call anyone else, he said; she should just relax.</p><p>Nathan was the easiest member of board to deal with. He was a good-looking man who had never married. She wasn\u2019t close enough to ask him if there was a long-lost love for whom he pined, but if so, it didn\u2019t seem to affect his dating life. At various functions, she\u2019d seen him with different women, all of them beautiful and elegant. He was unfailingly polite and courteous to her. Sometimes he teased her, claiming that he was waiting for her to notice him and ignore the age discrepancy; he teased a lot of people, though, and he had a way of making his words sound like a compliment rather than licentious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was the solid rock of the board, in Allison\u2019s opinion. Ethan Oxford was like a distant grandfather, Sarah was like the family old-maid aunt\u2014even though she\u2019d been married. She was high-strung. And Cherry was...Cherry. She always considered herself a cut above the rest of the world.</p><p>Allison was grateful that Nathan was going to speak with the other board members, but she did have to call Jason Lawrence and Annette Fanning.</p><p>Jason still seemed stunned by the whole thing. She told him about the attic but said they were keeping that information from the media.</p><p>He, too, wanted to make sure she was okay.</p> <p>After that she called Annette.</p><p>Annette was smart and fun and usually logical, so Allison was shocked by the tremor in her friend\u2019s voice and the view she seemed to be taking of the situation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising, is it? Oh, Allison, I thank God for that root canal, and I never thought I\u2019d say that. I wonder what happened. Did Julian freak out? One toke too many? But he\u2019s never been out of it at work. That\u2019s just the heavy-metal image he likes to portray. It\u2019s the house, Allison. It terrifies me! I can always feel it when I\u2019m there, like...like the house itself is breathing. I mean, when you\u2019re out on the street, the windows seem like eyes, watching you. Maybe so much evil did happen there and it continues, on and on. Like something malevolent that waits and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnette! No! The house is a pile of brick and wood and stone. It\u2019s a house. Horrible things take place everywhere. We go through life grateful when they don\u2019t happen to us, and either sad or broken when they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I for one am glad they\u2019re closing it down. No, wait\u2014do we get unemployment or anything? I\u2019m out of a job! I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to pay us\u2014there won\u2019t be any money coming into the house without the tours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re not out of work, Annette. They\u2019re closing it temporarily for an investigation. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll provide us with some kind of compensation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house needs an exorcism!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Annette, it doesn\u2019t. The house isn\u2019t possessed. Or evil. And if the house could feel anything, it would be grateful to us for keeping it alive. Annette\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhhh,\u201d Annette broke in. \u201cYou have another job. I don\u2019t. In fact, you have a cool job, a real job. You\u2019re a professor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnette, you do have a real job. The house will open again. It\u2019ll just be closed for a few weeks. They\u2019ll shore up the alarm system, and we\u2019ll be bombarded when we reopen because people are ghoulish and they\u2019ll want to stare at the place where Julian died. Besides, you work at the tavern as a singing waitress sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thank God! I was there last night. I went for a drink after my root canal and to hang with some of my friends. I can ask for a few more nights.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe house won\u2019t be closed that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you alone? Oh! You\u2019re not still at the police station, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw some government guy on the news\u2014not an interview, just a shot of him talking to the police. The U.S. government is in on this, Allison. It\u2019s scary, scary. But, hey, have you met him? My God, he\u2019s gorgeous! Whoops, excuse me, Barrie heard that. Barrie, he\u2019s not as gorgeous as you, just, um, pretty gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnette, pay attention. Those guys are here because of Adam Harrison. You know, the nice elderly gentleman who\u2019s been to a few functions at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember him. Maybe there is going to be an exorcism! I heard that his people look into strange stuff. Like paranormal events.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnette, if Barrie\u2019s there and has the day off, please go and spend some time with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of friend do you think I am? I\u2019ll be right there\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, please! I\u2019m fine by myself. I\u2019m going to try to get some rest. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Annette was silent. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you should be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnette, I\u2019m fine. I promise. I\u2019m going to curl up on the couch and try to doze off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall if you need me, Ally. I can be there in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Allison said. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She was able to hang up at last. Setting the phone down, she rose and headed into the kitchen to make a cup of tea. She really hoped she could doze off for a while, and hot tea and an inane comedy on TV should help her quell some of the thoughts and images racing through her mind.</p><p>She loved her new pod machine; a cup of English Breakfast tea brewed as swiftly as a cup of coffee. Mug in hand, she left the kitchen and came around the counter\u2014and froze.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone in the house. There was someone sitting in the chair by the sofa.</p><p>A dark-haired young man in Colonial dress.</p><p>It was Julian Mitchell.</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>He was still there.</p><p>The cup fell from her hand. She heard it shatter on the tile floor.</p><p>Then she followed it down. She was vaguely aware that a few body parts hurt but not for long.</p><p>Mercifully, the world went black as she passed out cold.</p><p>4</p><p>Tyler stood in the attic of the Tarleton-Dandridge House looking at the disarray.</p><p>Someone had been searching\u2014for what?</p><p>He wanted to straighten up the room; it was far easier to figure out what was missing when everything else was in the right place. He\u2019d need to involve others with that, which he didn\u2019t want to do quite yet. He\u2019d had offers from the board to come in and help, but he\u2019d turned them down. He\u2019d actually lied to Nathan Pierson, telling him he preferred to wait until he was sure the police were finished with their forensics before bringing anyone else in.</p><p>The police were finished. And after speaking with Detective Jenson, he knew they weren\u2019t expecting to find anything useful, unless by some unlikely chance they were to lift foreign prints\u2014those not associated with the four guides or the board members, whose prints they\u2019d already taken. If they were really lucky, they\u2019d come up with prints belonging to someone with a criminal record.</p><p>He wanted to work with Allison Leigh for the obvious reasons. She was the one who\u2019d found the body and who knew this house backward and forward, along with the history. He\u2019d gone through the biographies and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the employees and the board, and there was no one better qualified to help him than Allison. She was in denial right now; he assumed that would change.</p><p>So far, although he had a sense of being watched in the house, Tyler hadn\u2019t seen a single movement, felt a brush of cold air or even heard an old board creak.</p><p>The house was waiting\u2014or those within it were. Waiting and watching.</p><p>He left the attic and walked back down to the second floor, taking a few minutes to go into every room. He\u2019d been glad to hear from Nathan Pierson that there was no plan by the board to give up the house. It was on the national historic register, of course, so there was virtually no threat that it would be bulldozed. Meticulously restored, the Tarleton-Dandridge House was one of the finest examples of early Americana he\u2019d ever seen. It would be a shame if it was closed to the public to become the offices of an accounting agency or a bank.</p><p>Tyler paused at Lucy Tarleton\u2019s room. He walked inside to look at the painting of Beast Bradley.</p><p>Here, as Tyler had observed before, he was portrayed as a thoughtful man. He appeared to be strong, but almost saddened by the weight of responsibility. He\u2019d been a man with well-arranged features, handsome in youth.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>Next he studied the painting of a young and innocent Lucy Tarleton, a woman as yet untouched by death and bloodshed. He noted that there was something about Lucy\u2019s eyes that made him think of Allison. There was definitely a resemblance, although it was true that many young women, dressed as Lucy, might look like the long-gone heroine.</p><p>Tyler stood very still, allowing himself to feel the house.</p><p>Again he experienced the sensation of being watched, but there were no sounds from the old place, nor did he see anything or notice any drafts.</p><p>He headed down to the study where he\u2019d left his briefcase with his computer and the records Adam had arranged for him to receive.</p><p>They recorded many instances of normal life and death\u2014many births had taken place in the house, although sadly two of the mothers had died in childbirth. A number of people had died in their beds of natural causes, one Dandridge at the grand old age of a hundred and five.</p><p>During the War of 1812, Sophia Tarleton-Dandridge and her husband had owned the house; they\u2019d taken in a wounded soldier and he had passed away. He was buried with the family in the graveyard behind the stables. A family friend had come to the house after the Battle of Gettysburg. He was also buried in the family graveyard.</p><p>Sad and tragic deaths due to warfare, Tyler thought. Not unexpected and not the kind of thing that would produce anything terrible.</p><p>But then, Beast Bradley had been the terror that touched the house....</p><p>Looking further into the family history, Tyler saw that another death had been that of a young Dandridge girl in 1863. He wondered if she\u2019d been in love with the Civil War soldier who\u2019d died. She\u2019d taken rat poison and killed herself soon after his death.</p><p>He shuddered. Hard way to die, rat poison.</p><p>And another hard way to die\u2014a bayonet through the chin. He tried to imagine how it had happened. Julian had sat down, his musket held between his legs. He\u2019d leaned forward and set the soft flesh behind his jawbone on the blade of the bayonet. Then he\u2019d lowered his head with enough force for the blade to go through that soft flesh and his throat? It seemed almost impossible.</p><p>Unless he\u2019d been helped.</p><p>Fascinating though the historical events were, Tyler was more interested in Julian\u2019s death and the deaths of people who had died closer to the present. There\u2019d been several of those, starting in the late 1970s.</p><p>One of the docents, Bill Hall, had been found at the foot of the staircase. While closing up at night, he\u2019d apparently tripped and fallen down the stairs, landing at an angle that had snapped his neck. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eight years ago, a college student, Sam Daily, had told friends he was going to break into a historic house and rearrange a few items as a joke. It hadn\u2019t gone so well; he\u2019d tried to dismantle the alarm and a wire had shorted out, sending electric volts shooting through him. He\u2019d been discovered on the ground near the back door the following morning.</p><p>Tragically the joke had been on him.</p><p>Just three years ago, another of the older docents or tour guides, Angela Wilson, had been found dead in Tarleton\u2019s study. She\u2019d been sitting in the same chair, in the same position, as Julian Mitchell. She had died of a massive heart attack.</p> <p>One death from a fall, one from electrocution and one from what might well be a perfectly natural cause for someone of Angela\u2019s age, a heart attack.</p><p>And now a man dead of a bayonet shoved through his throat\u2014as if he\u2019d set his own chin atop it for the blade to run through.</p><p>Tyler drummed his fingers on the desk.</p><p>He was here because of Adam Harrison. Adam had a love of and connection to various historic properties. Technically, the Krewes were Adam\u2019s teams, so they went where Adam Harrison requested they go. Everything that had happened here could have been natural or accidental.</p><p>But Adam had a knack of knowing when things weren\u2019t right.</p> <p>Add in the trashing of the small office in the attic....</p><p>Someone had been looking for something. What? And why?</p><p>And how did any of it relate to the fact that Artie Dixon was in a coma?</p><p>Tyler pulled out his cell phone and called Logan Raintree, one of his best friends, a fellow Ranger at one time, and now the head of their unit.</p><p>\u201cIs it something\u2014or nothing?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cDo you need the rest of the Krewe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd yes. I\u2019d like you to come here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny idea as to what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But the house has been closed down for the interim. I think we should set up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be in tomorrow night,\u201d Logan promised him.</p><p>Tyler hung up and put through another call. When he reached Adam Harrison, he asked about keys to the attic.</p><p>\u201cThe board members all have a key, and so does Allison. There\u2019s also a key in the small pantry or storage room, where the employees have their lockers and keep their street clothing. It\u2019s always hung on a peg there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the pantry locked during the day?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, not from what I understand. The employees slip in and out when they have a break or need to get to their own belongings. No member of the public goes into the house without a docent or tour guide, and they\u2019ve never had trouble before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if that key is still in place, but a lot of people have keys. They could have been used\u2014or copied at a previous date.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my guide,\u201d Tyler told him.</p><p>\u201cI can call someone else.\u201d</p><p>Tyler hesitated. Maybe that was the right thing to do. Bring in someone who hadn\u2019t discovered a dead friend at the house. Someone who wasn\u2019t derisive of the investigation.</p><p>But he realized he didn\u2019t want anyone else.</p><p>And as far as her attitude was concerned... It didn\u2019t matter if you believed the world was round or not, because it was round regardless of what you believed.</p><p>Eventually, Allison would accept the fact that something existed in the Tarleton-Dandridge House.</p><p>And as Todd had suggested, it liked her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Adam. I\u2019ll move along on my own for a bit, see if Ms. Leigh begins to show some interest. I\u2019m sure her heart is in the right place. I\u2019ll give her more time. The rest of the team will be in tomorrow night, and we\u2019ll see where we are then.\u201d</p><p>Adam agreed with him and they hung up. Tyler immediately went to the guides\u2019 room; the key hung on a peg there, so access to the attic was ridiculously easy. He returned to the study, picking up the folders that held information on the board members. Pausing, he looked at the painting of Beast Bradley.</p><p>He\u2019d been perceived so differently by the two artists.</p><p>He stood, fascinated by the painting, and walked over to it. A Plexiglas cover protected it and he saw that, apparently from the time it had been hung, it had resided on that wall to avoid direct sunlight.</p><p>He tried to read the signature of the artist and was surprised to realize that the name was T. Dandridge. He squinted to find the date; the painting had been done in 1781. The year the Colonies had finally achieved their independence.</p><p>He smiled. Yes, the artist of this particular likeness had truly loathed his subject.</p><p>Tyler left the study and went up the stairs, back to Lucy Tarleton\u2019s room, and looked at the painting there. The signature appeared to be Josiah Bell. The work was dated 1777.</p><p>Thoughtful, Tyler returned to the study once more. A truism in life was that everyone perceived others in their own way. Where one person saw kindness in someone, another saw weakness. Where one saw cruelty, another saw strength.</p><p>Perception. Always nine-tenths of reality.</p><p>He smiled. Sadly, he was certain, Allison Leigh saw him as an oversize quack. A pretentious hick.</p><p>Amused, he considered his own perceptions of her. A woman with a lot of pride and yet humility. A lover of truth and honor, but stubborn and determined. Stunning with her pitch-dark hair and bright blue eyes, but dismissive of her looks. The woman was a scholar, after all, and took her work seriously.</p><p>He hoped she\u2019d come around. There was just something about her\u2014something in the helpless look she\u2019d given Todd, something that was kind and empathetic.</p><p>And despite the situation\u2014despite her exhausted, annoyed and bewildered behavior toward him\u2014he still found her...sensual.</p><p>The ghost likes her, Todd had said. Yes, sometimes ghosts watched a person, and just as the living did, they knew who they liked\u2014and who they didn\u2019t.</p><p>He stared at the painting. It didn\u2019t move, but Todd was right. The eyes had been well-painted, giving the illusion that the painting could watch someone moving about the room.</p><p>He leaned back in his chair. \u201cI am here,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He was greeted by silence. There were secrets in this house, but so far, the ghostly inhabitants were guarding those secrets.</p><p>Some of his coworkers had known from the time they were children that they had an extra sense, whether they saw it as a gift or a curse. They\u2019d had grandparents or friends who\u2019d appeared at their own funerals or talked to them in the middle of the night, or even showed up in other places.</p><p>Tyler, however, had no clue he had any unusual abilities until he\u2019d done a stint in the service and then come home to become a Texas Ranger. He\u2019d loved stories about the Rangers all his life; becoming a Ranger had been a dream. It was when he\u2019d been a Ranger for a year that he\u2019d first experienced the unusual. The situation had been especially poignant. Drug runners had kidnapped their mule\u2019s younger sister. The older sister had become a heroin addict, and when she hadn\u2019t been able to produce the money they\u2019d wanted quickly enough, they\u2019d killed her with an overdose. The younger sister had been left to rot at the bottom of a cistern out on the dusty Texas plain. A desperate, state-wide search had been instigated to find the seventeen-year-old. Tyler was standing in the middle of the sprawling ranch house where the drug runners were based when the older sister, pathetic, shaking and twitching, had appeared to him, begging him to help.</p><p>He thought he\u2019d been drinking too much; he tried to tell himself that he wasn\u2019t seeing what he was seeing. She followed him. She was next to him even when he was with other officers. She didn\u2019t know where her sister was, but he had to help her, she said.</p><p>He was trying. He was trying so damned hard.</p><p>He stayed on his shift for several extra hours, searching the house, the barn, the stables, everywhere. He headed back to a bar for the night and discovered the dead woman on the stool next to him. He went home and she invaded his bedroom.</p><p>The next morning he got up and joined the search again, quizzing his ghost relentlessly about the property.</p><p>In the end, he found the younger sister in the cistern. He found her alive\u2014shaken and dehydrated, but alive. His crying, grateful ghost left him, and for months afterward, he wondered if the pressure of the case hadn\u2019t made him delusional.</p><p>Then he\u2019d walked into his office one day to see an old man sitting by his desk. No one else saw this old man, who wanted Tyler to find his murderer. Eventually he did.</p><p>The poor guy\u2019s son-in-law had figured he wasn\u2019t leaving the world soon enough and had helped him meet his Maker.</p><p>For a long time, he\u2019d thought he was crazy. But as he and Logan Raintree worked together, they each learned that the other saw unusual things. That they both did. When Logan was approached by Jackson Crow, head of the first Krewe, and then Tyler was asked to join, as well, he felt it was the right thing to do. And it had been. They\u2019d solved cases. Saved lives.</p><p>And they uncovered the truth.</p><p>He\u2019d also learned that not all ghosts walked over to a man and started up a conversation. Some chose to speak only to certain people.</p><p>Just like the living did.</p><p>He shook off his memories and returned to the information on the four board members who ran the private Old Philly History Corporation.</p><p>Nathan Pierson, forty-five, real estate broker by day, financially comfortable with excellent stock investments.</p><p>Sarah Vining, fifty-one, philanthropist, wealthy due to an oil inheritance.</p><p>Cherry Addison, forty-three, a direct descendent of the Tarleton-Dandridge family on the maternal side, a former model and sometime actress with family money. Married to an artist of increasing renown.</p><p>Ethan Oxford, seventy-two, lawyer and politician.</p><p>He needed to meet them all. The best way to do that might be to call an impromptu board meeting.</p><p>Tyler realized he wasn\u2019t giving the attention he should to the folders. He rose and stretched. As he did, he thought he heard something from the rear of the house.</p><p>He left the study, looking at the rooms and the elegant entry as he walked to the front door. Nothing seemed to have changed. He strode through the rooms and then to the back door, unlocking it to step outside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The moon was waning, but it still seemed to be full. And beneath that light, in the middle of the yard between the kitchen and the stables, he saw a horse. A majestic animal, huge, black and sleek.</p><p>He walked over to the horse and the animal gazed at him. He felt a cold sensation as a large black head nuzzled his chest. He stroked the cool air, seeing the animal\u2019s dark eyes and fine brow.</p><p>\u201cHey, fellow, still pounding the beat, eh?\u201d he murmured.</p> <p>The horse whinnied but couldn\u2019t answer any questions for him. A ghost horse couldn\u2019t speak any more than a living one could. But he was encouraged. If the horse was here, the house itself was opening to him.</p><p>He heard another sound\u2014whining. He glanced down. There was a dog by his feet. a hound, large and tawny in color, with huge brown eyes that looked up at him trustingly. He hunkered down to touch the dog, feeling air, but aware that the hound knew it was being stroked. \u201cThank you, boy. Thank you for coming to me,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIf I can help, I will.\u201d</p><p>He was so involved with visions of the family creatures that he was startled when his phone rang.</p><p>\u201cMontague,\u201d he said quickly, grinning to himself. The ghost hound had pushed him\u2014nothing but a blast of air or imagination, but it had almost knocked him over.</p><p>\u201cAgent Montague, it\u2019s Allison Leigh. I\u2019ve, uh, had a nap. If you want to talk, I\u2019m willing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right by to get you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Allison had managed to convince herself that she was totally sane; she was just under intense pressure.</p><p>And she was going to do the sane and intelligent thing. See a shrink.</p><p>Annette Fanning sat on a stool at the counter, looking at her with concern.</p><p>She was grateful to Annette. Her friend had arrived just as she\u2019d come to, and when she\u2019d let Annette in and continued to run through her house searching for a sign that someone had been there, Annette had kept quiet and helped. Now, she stared at Allison.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making more tea? What you need is a good shot,\u201d Annette told her sagely. \u201cAnd if you won\u2019t have one, I will. You\u2019d barely gotten off the floor when I got here. You could have hurt yourself! I still don\u2019t understand what happened. You saw someone in your house, or you think you saw someone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone was really here. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m just mourning Julian, which is something I wasn\u2019t able to do before. I mean, I found him, and then the rest of the night I was with the cops and at the station and back at the house, and then we found the office trashed....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a good shot of whiskey,\u201d Annette said again, getting up and going to the cabinet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any whiskey. I just called that agent and said I\u2019d go out with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a plan. He\u2019s really hot-looking, Allison.\u201d</p><p>Allison frowned at her. \u201cI don\u2019t mean go out in that sense. I\u2019m going to answer questions for him and tell him about people. It\u2019s not a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pity,\u201d Annette said. She was tiny and blonde and struggled to reach the bottle shoved at the back of the cabinet. \u201cYou should get a real life, you know. You can\u2019t spend your life in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t spend my life in the past,\u201d Allison said, getting the bottle for her. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want a shot, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do\u2014really!\u201d Annette accepted the whiskey bottle and poured herself a measure. \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone out since you were dating Peter Aubrey, right? I thought you two were great together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen he was clean, we were great. I cared about Pete and it was fun being with him. But I didn\u2019t have the power to change him. I picked him up from various gigs three times when his friends called to say he\u2019d passed out and needed help. And I went back to him twice when he said he\u2019d kill himself if I left him. I learned. It has nothing to do with me\u2014he has to find a way to face his demons. I went to Narcotics Anonymous and learned that I can\u2019t change him. Only he can do that. If he ever gets cleaned up, goes into rehab and is serious about it, I\u2019ll consider seeing him again,\u201d Allison told her. \u201cI\u2019m not antisocial. I\u2019m not lonely. And now is not the time to worry about my social life. Julian is dead, Annette, and the house is in the middle of some investigation....\u201d She let her voice fade away; Annette\u2019s big brown eyes were moist again.</p><p>\u201cI still can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Annette said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe that Julian\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Annette, I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I know.\u201d She let out a long sigh. \u201cI called Nathan to find out if the board knew anything about funeral arrangements but no one\u2019s heard anything. The family wants the body shipped back to Indiana, but the morgue isn\u2019t going to release him until...until whatever, I don\u2019t know. There are still tests being done, I guess. Do you think he\u2019d been drinking or that he was high or something? This is all so mysterious. Oh! Nathan did say he\u2019d make sure we have a memorial in the next few weeks, no matter what. Julian had a lot of fans in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a decent musician and he had a great stage presence. I guess that\u2019s why he made a good guide,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cWhen he showed up,\u201d Annette agreed. She walked back into the living room. \u201cHey, where\u2019s your broom? I\u2019m going to sweep one more time. You walk around barefoot\u2014don\u2019t want you cutting your foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink your whiskey. The floor is fine. I cleaned it over and over again,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>The doorbell rang, and Allison looked at Annette. \u201cNot a word, okay? Not a single word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even \u2018hello\u2019?\u201d Annette asked. \u201cAnd here I\u2019d been thinking about adding something like \u2018nice to meet you\u2019!\u201d</p><p>Allison went to the door, flashing Annette a warning frown. Annette grinned.</p><p>Tyler stood there, so tall he nearly filled the doorframe.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she greeted him. \u201cCome in.\u201d</p><p>He entered. Allison quickly introduced him to Annette, who giggled, offering him her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really tall,\u201d Annette said.</p><p>Tyler nodded. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnette!\u201d Allison whispered. \u201cThat\u2019s...rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Ms. Fanning,\u201d Tyler said with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s under such circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Julian.\u201d Annette shook her head. Denial would be with all of them for a long time, Allison thought.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d Tyler told Annette. \u201cI wanted to talk to you about the Tarleton-Dandridge House and about Julian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke with a police officer, but I\u2019m happy to talk to you, too. I last saw Julian at lunch. I didn\u2019t think about it much. I had to leave early myself. Root canal,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut I\u2019m not surprised he ducked out for an audition. Music was everything to Julian. Oh, he liked his job and he was good at it. But he did want to be rich and famous. A rock star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if we sit?\u201d Tyler asked Allison.</p><p>She indicated the parlor. Her house, which had been built in the early 1800s, wasn\u2019t quite as old as the Tarleton-Dandridge. The original owner\u2019s grandson had sold it to her great-grandfather in 1890. Originally, the kitchen had been outside, and the counter had been put in somewhere around 1910, when the kitchen became part of the house. A lot of her furniture was pre-Civil War.</p><p>Her sofa, however, was a purchase she\u2019d made just a few years earlier. It was plush and soft and nice, like the massive armchair to the side of it.</p><p>Tyler Montague took the chair; Annette sat close by, on the edge of the sofa, clearly fascinated. She rested an elbow on one arm of the sofa as she stared at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think happened at the Tarleton-Dandridge House?\u201d Tyler asked her.</p><p>Annette blinked. \u201cDo you mean about Julian\u2014or someone trashing the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth, either,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sad, of course, and horrified. We talked about Julian all the time. He knew it and didn\u2019t really care. He held on to his job at the house because he was good, very dramatic. But he wasn\u2019t responsible. We all liked him. It was hard not to. He was just...ambitious. He wanted to be a rock star, like I said. But he did love history.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd he loved to play online games\u2014Words with Friends\u2014all kinds of stuff. He acted like a blowhard sometimes, but he was very smart.\u201d Tears welled up in Annette\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. It\u2019s so, so sad. But it was an accident, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to determine,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cBut...he was alone in the house with Allison, wasn\u2019t he? She would never have hurt him. She won\u2019t even put out poison to kill rats.... I think she gives half her income to societies that save animals. Of course, it\u2019s true that people who love animals don\u2019t always love people, but to suspect that Allison could have hurt Julian in any way\u2014it\u2019s crazy! Okay, he\u2019s made us so mad at times that she might have wanted to smack him. And he did try to pick her up when he first started working there a year ago. She was seeing Peter Aubrey back then, and besides, she isn\u2019t the type to play around at work and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Allison finally interrupted her rambling. \u201cAnnette. I think Tyler wants to talk about the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll impressions are important,\u201d Tyler said smoothly. \u201cSo, you do believe Julian Mitchell was intelligent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian was definitely smart,\u201d Allison replied. \u201cHe was brilliant with the English language.\u201d She hesitated and then admitted, \u201cHe and I did have a competition on Words with Friends. His ability was uncanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even bother to play with him, I was so bad,\u201d Annette said.</p><p>\u201cWould Julian have trashed the attic for any reason?\u201d Tyler asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Annette and Allison looked at each other. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he would\u2014Julian had access to the attic. He could go up there whenever he wanted. But I don\u2019t understand why anyone would trash the attic. We never keep money there. Cash receipts and credit card payments are kept in the lockbox in the little pantry where we get changed. Every couple of days, one of us took the deposit to the bank. And there\u2019s never enough cash worth stealing. These days, reservations are mostly done online or with credit cards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what is kept in the attic?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cPaperwork, records\u2014copies of records. Everything historically significant is in locked display cases,\u201d Annette said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of paperwork?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual.\u201d Annette shrugged.</p><p>\u201cFinancial logs, schedules, events, reservations and some of the research we do,\u201d Allison explained.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Allison\u2019s research. She\u2019s always writing some paper or other,\u201d Annette said. \u201cShe\u2019s a professor! And she\u2019s the best guide they\u2019ve ever had, because she knows so much about the families and their history. Julian was interested in her research, but he wouldn\u2019t need to trash the attic. None of us would. Allison is always happy to show us her work.\u201d</p><p>Tyler watched her intently. Allison decided she was a little uncomfortable with Annette being so much of a champion.</p> <p>\u201cI write papers, yes, articles, on select periods of American history or focusing on a certain event,\u201d Allison said. \u201cEventually I hope to complete a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I\u2019m working on a paper about the British occupation of Philadelphia, focusing on the Tarleton-Dandridge House and Bradley\u2019s relationship with the family, especially Lucy. I\u2019m also looking at Lucy\u2019s relationship with her fianc\u00e9, Stewart Douglas. There\u2019s a lot of mystery around her death. No one was called in to investigate and historians assume that\u2019s because Beast Bradley killed her and it was all shoved under the carpet. The British were evacuating at about the same time.\u201d She paused, impatient. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. I\u2019m really hungry. Could we go somewhere for food?\u201d She had groceries but wanted to bring this inquiry to an end\u2014and wanted to escape her house for a while.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Annette said with dismay. \u201cI have to get back. I told Barrie I\u2019d only be a few minutes, but I was so worried about Allison I forgot the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were worried about Allison? Why?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s been so traumatic!\u201d Allison said firmly, giving Annette a warning stare.</p> <p>\u201cAh, yeah, right. I wanted to make sure she was doing okay. I\u2019d be in a loony bin if it\u2019d been me who found Julian,\u201d Annette said. \u201cWell.\u201d She stood as if loath to go. Tyler rose to his feet, as well.</p><p>Allison looked at Tyler, wondering whether she was stuck with him.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry, too? You don\u2019t need to come with me. You can find me here tomorrow,\u201d she said. She didn\u2019t know whether she dreaded having him come along, or whether she\u2019d be disappointed if he didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cEating, yeah, I\u2019m into it. Works for me a few times a day. I\u2019ll join you.\u201d</p><p>Annette offered him her hand and Tyler shook it. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she said. \u201cCall me anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Allison got them both out the door, then hesitated, looking back, before closing it.</p><p>She thought she saw something move in the kitchen.</p> <p>It\u2019s just a reflection, she told herself. A reflection from the outside light on the shiny steel toaster. It was nothing....</p><p>She realized she was afraid to come home alone.</p><p>5</p><p>Allison Leigh did know and love her city, Tyler observed. Her home was on Chestnut, near a number of tourist destinations. When they left the house, she didn\u2019t have a place in mind; she told him the city was filled with wonderful restaurants.</p><p>They decided to leave the cars and walk down to Walnut, where a friend of hers owned a pub called McDooley\u2019s. His name really was McDooley and the pub was very old. Oddly enough, another McDooley\u2014no relation\u2014had owned the pub in the 1920s so there\u2019d been no need for a name change when this McDooley bought the pub.</p><p>Tyler was surprised that her explanation regarding McDooley\u2019s ownership of McDooley\u2019s was given with such ease and charm. He hadn\u2019t imagined she was capable of being so lighthearted, but she had him laughing, and while they walked she mentioned funny or odd tidbits of history that kept him fascinated.</p><p>Her friend McDooley\u2014first name Evan\u2014was behind the bar when they walked in, a jovial-looking man probably around thirty, and probably fond of a pint or two, since he was showing the beginnings of a beer belly at his young age.</p><p>Evan McDooley started off smiling when he saw Allison, then quickly became grave, telling her how sorry he\u2019d been to hear that a friend and coworker of hers had died. She thanked him and introduced him to Tyler. Evan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of you!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cWill this be like...a real ghost investigation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a real investigation,\u201d Tyler told him. \u201cWe go through everything. Any possible structural problems, history, people involved with the house\u2014everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Evan said, his hands frozen on the glass he\u2019d been drying as he stared at Tyler. \u201cThat sounds really cool. Oh, wait, no, sorry\u2014the house is closed, right, Allison? People will be out of work for a while. Hey, I could use an extra waiter or waitress for the night shift, if any of you need some income.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m researching a paper so I could use the time off,\u201d Allison said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll talk to Jason and Annette. One of them might be grateful for some work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a booth in the corner that\u2019s free if you want to take a seat and I\u2019ll have someone right with you. Can I get you a brew? We have a nice selection of beers on tap.\u201d</p><p>Allison asked him for a Scottish ale and Tyler chose a stout. Evan pulled the drafts before they walked to the table. Tyler hadn\u2019t expected her to drink with him, even a beer, but then he hadn\u2019t expected her to be so charming as they walked to the restaurant, either.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the paper you\u2019re writing now,\u201d Tyler said as they sat.</p><p>She waved a hand in the air. \u201cI already told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, I\u2019m an assistant professor of history. I\u2019m sure you know we\u2019re expected to publish. So I write pieces that appear in magazines read by other professors who actually care about little incidents that occurred\u2014along with the major events, of course. I\u2019m interested in the everyday, human dimension of history\u2014social history you might call it. Domestic life is a big part of that. That\u2019s why I focus on something like the Tarleton-Dandridge House instead of the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many people know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cEveryone knows I\u2019m working on a piece about Lucy Tarleton and Beast Bradley, and that I\u2019m planning to write a book about everything that went on at the house the year the British were in occupancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you leave papers in the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of my research, but it\u2019s all copies of papers, newspaper articles and letters I\u2019ve gathered from libraries and other institutions. Also copies of documents held by the house. As Annette mentioned, the originals are under lock and key. Oh, plus some of my notes. The article\u2019s a work in progress.\u201d Allison frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know why anyone would want copies of what I\u2019ve got,\u201d she said. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t understand what anyone would want in that attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more about your friend Annette,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cYou met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes should do it. She\u2019s a bundle of energy, loves life, loves working at the house. She enjoys working in the old taverns, too\u2014she\u2019s on call at one called the Bitsy Betsy House. The staff serve at the tables and break into period song with a strolling flutist now and then.\u201d</p><p>Tyler grinned. \u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Jason Lawrence like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason is a nice guy,\u201d Allison said. \u201cResponsible and a good tour guide. Very entertaining when we go out to dinner together. Acts a little silly when he drinks, but who doesn\u2019t? He\u2019s smart, and he\u2019s been honest about the fact that he\u2019s heading back to NYU in a couple of years. He wants to do his doctorate in political science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get along well with them? Both him and Annette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we get along great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut no one really got along with Julian Mitchell?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head. \u201cYou have to understand. We all liked him. He was fun, and he was a terrific performer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the board members? How do you feel about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe board?\u201d she asked, frowning again.</p><p>Tyler took a sip of his draft. It was good and very cold. \u201cThe board members who run the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, they\u2019re...fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re all that fond of them,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. I just don\u2019t work with them every day. I do like them. Not as much as my friends and colleagues, but that\u2019s a given, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who your friends are, do I?\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cIf I\u2019d walked in here alone, would I have known you were friends with the owner?\u201d</p><p>She grinned at that and raised her draft to him. \u201cAh, but you\u2019re an FBI agent. With all sorts of information in your dossiers and reports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA report can\u2019t really tell you how someone feels about others,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut you do know a lot about all of us, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I should.\u201d He took another sip of his beer. \u201cThis came up quickly. I drove here an hour after Adam called me, and I didn\u2019t get to my reading material until you ditched me today.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly ditch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA colleague of mine died,\u201d she pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I realize that,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut I hope you\u2019ll help me. I\u2019m trying to find out why your colleague died. Of the board members, who\u2019s your favorite?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm. I\u2019m not sure. Either Nathan or Sarah. Sarah is the kind of woman who can remind you of a shelter dog\u2014she looks as if she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s going to be beaten. I don\u2019t know why. She came from money, married money, never had children and is a widow now. Her husband was quite a bit older. Maybe he was a jerk. She doesn\u2019t talk about him or the time she was married at all. She\u2019s very sweet and hard to draw into a conversation. I always feel like I should help her or stand up for her\u2014but I have no idea what I\u2019d be standing up against. Nathan, on the other hand, is talkative and cheerful, and he really loves the house and the history. Ethan Oxford is quiet and dignified, and I don\u2019t know him very well. It\u2019s usually either Nathan or Sarah who talks to us about policy changes and so on. And Cherry...hmm. She has attitude. Or make that arrogance. The problem is that she isn\u2019t always right about historical facts, even when they concern the house. And if anyone tries to explain something to her, she gets angry and tells us she\u2019s a descendent of the family and we\u2019re not. But, in all honesty, I don\u2019t really blame her. She\u2019s married to a well-known artist who gets tons of attention, so...maybe it\u2019s her way of making sure she has her own identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. I can\u2019t wait to meet her,\u201d Tyler said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t met the board yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a meeting with them in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere are you staying?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cAt the Tarleton-Dandridge House,\u201d he said.</p><p>She seemed startled by that. \u201cYou\u2019re staying there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s best to be right where you\u2019re working. And I thought you didn\u2019t believe in ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she said quickly. Too quickly? \u201cBut no one\u2019s ever stayed there\u2014not in my memory. There are so many priceless artifacts in that house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to throw a frat party.\u201d</p> <p>She flushed. \u201cWe open the house and grounds for special events, but bring in extra security. It\u2019s just...well, paintings on the wall are irreplaceable. Knickknacks set around the place are invaluable. Some of the lace doilies on the furniture are from the 1700s. You have to be so careful in there.\u201d</p><p>He leaned back, smiling. She was always so serious, it was rather endearing.</p><p>\u201cWhat was high school like for you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrains and beauty,\u201d he teased. \u201cDid you ever go to a football game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. And I actually watch football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now and then.\u201d She waved a hand in the air. \u201cI throw a party every year for the Super Bowl thing.\u201d</p> <p>He lowered his head, still smiling.</p><p>She continued, her tone that of a professor. \u201cBut as to the Tarleton-Dandridge House...things there truly are irreplaceable. We lose so much history every year. We should preserve whatever we can for the ages, for our children and grandchildren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do any damage to the house. The board knows I\u2019m in there and they\u2019ve approved. It was Adam\u2019s idea. When my Krewe arrives, they\u2019ll be staying there, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d she murmured. \u201cPlease. You\u2019re going to tramp through the house with all kinds of ridiculous equipment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have cameras and heat sensors, but we don\u2019t tramp.\u201d</p><p>She sat back, frowning. \u201cYou really should be supervised while you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAllison, think about it. We do what we do because of a man who respects history as holy ground. We\u2019ve worked in some of the most historic and fragile and secretive places in this country. You\u2019re welcome to come back with me and see where I\u2019ve set up,\u201d he told her.</p><p>Evidently, that suggestion didn\u2019t please her at all. She ignored the question and pointed to his menu.</p><p>\u201cYou should try their shepherd\u2019s pie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s excellent.\u201d</p><p>He did; they ordered and their food was served ten minutes later. He was surprised that she seemed nervous as the meal came to a close. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be around during the day. You loved the house when you were a child, you\u2019ve worked there as a guide, and you can supervise everything that goes on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you know I loved the house when I was young? Oh, of course, you have information on me, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not really fair, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the investigator. I think that means it\u2019s fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about you? Did ghosts talk to you as a kid?\u201d she asked teasingly.</p><p>\u201cNope. I grew up in San Antonio, went into the service, got out, went to the University of Maryland for criminal law and became a Texas Ranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was high school for you?\u201d she asked him. \u201cWait, don\u2019t tell me. You were a linebacker on the football team. Cheerleaders were entertainment for you, and you somehow managed to keep your grades up enough to stay on the team and get scholarships, but you were bred with Texas machismo and therefore it was necessary to join the army before going for your education. That sounds terrible\u2014I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m grateful to our armed forces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI joined the navy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really remember the cheerleaders as entertainment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dated one, though, right?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, never. I dated the same girl through high school. She\u2019s gone on to work for the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. We\u2019re still friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d was all the response he received.</p><p>He asked the waitress for their check, only to find out that Evan had picked it up and wouldn\u2019t back down, even when Tyler tried to explain that as a law enforcement officer, he could be cited for accepting a free meal. \u201cBut Ally isn\u2019t a law enforcement officer, and she\u2019s the one I\u2019m taking care of. Besides, you\u2019re her guest. And I won\u2019t tell if you don\u2019t. Come back with friends and spend more money,\u201d he told them cheerfully, waving away their thanks.</p><p>Tyler realized he was never going to get that check; he thanked Evan, assured him they\u2019d return soon and left their waitress a generous tip.</p><p>It was while they were on their way out that a slim woman in very high heels and a tight skirt came breezing through the doorway. She almost passed them, but then she noticed Allison and started to say something but saw Tyler, as well, and stopped dead.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cherry,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cHello, Ally.\u201d She glanced at Allison briefly, staring at Tyler, and then shaking her head as she looked at Allison again. \u201cOh, my dear, it\u2019s good to see you out and about. I\u2019m so, so sorry about that charming young man, Julian.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for Allison to reply, but turned to Tyler, extending a hand. \u201cYou must be with Adam Harrison\u2019s people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Tyler Montague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry. Cherry Addison. You\u2019re very welcome here. We adore the house and want any...difficulties resolved. I must admit I didn\u2019t think the idea of bringing your team in to stay was the best, but we made the decision as a group. And you certainly look as if you\u2019ll be capable of managing any situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, ma\u2019am,\u201d he told her. So this was the Tarleton-Dandridge descendent. She was an attractive woman, determined to retain the appearance of youth. Her hair was carefully cut at an angle, and her face was smooth. Unfortunately, its smooth perfection was indicative of cosmetic surgery or at least Botox.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re helping Agent Montague?\u201d she asked Allison, who nodded. \u201cWell, naturally, Allison knows her history. We\u2019re delighted to have such a scholar among our guides, but...of course, I know the history of the house as no one else does. So when you need my assistance...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. We\u2019re scheduled to meet in the morning,\u201d Tyler reminded her.</p><p>\u201cTen o\u2019clock. I believe we\u2019ll be at Ethan\u2019s place.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019re not meeting at the house. However, I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow. Needless to say, the board is anxious about the house. We take its preservation very seriously. Because of what\u2019s happened\u2014so tragic\u2014it seemed necessary to close for a period. But should you need my personal assistance in any way, don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch. I will make myself entirely available to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you, thank you,\u201d Tyler said. She still just stood there, staring at him.</p><p>\u201cWell, good evening, then, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll see you in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, good evening. Allison, have the best night you can, my dear,\u201d she said, and moved into the restaurant.</p><p>Tyler held the door until she was inside. She looked at him again, gave him a lingering smile and headed to the bar.</p><p>When he closed the door, he saw that Allison was grinning.</p><p>\u201cWell, that was the famous descendent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was ready to devour you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she expected to see either of us here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she could care less about seeing me. But you\u2019re a big boy. You can handle her...and her assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a Dandridge descendent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t work at the house every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, I\u2019m part-time.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and didn\u2019t reply. She seemed to be in a good mood, still amused by Cherry Addison\u2019s reaction to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But as they walked, her smile faded. She moved more slowly as they left the restaurant behind.</p><p>He was surprised. She was trying to draw out their evening together.</p><p>Fine. He slowed his pace, as well, curious about her reasons.</p> <p>They walked back along Market Street and the quiet of night made the experience of looking at the facade of Independence Hall seem even more hallowed. He tried to imagine how the hotheaded politicians of the time had managed to work together well enough to \u201cmake thirteen colonies chime as one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA penny for your thoughts,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cA penny? With inflation? My thoughts are worth at least two cents.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I could afford them these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking that it\u2019s a miracle we exist as a nation. Could you picture our Congress today cooperating to make that kind of decision?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood point,\u201d she said. \u201cPatrick Henry and Sam Adams were fierce and fiery orators, and they didn\u2019t always agree with each other. They made it work somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey had the same goal.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAnd they put aside their differences to achieve that goal. We can keep hoping! They realized that society would change over time. When you think about the past two-hundred-plus years, they didn\u2019t do so badly. Most of them knew the slavery question would arise, but they felt they had to create a country before dealing with such a serious issue. We\u2019ve made mistakes as a nation and we\u2019ll continue to make mistakes. That\u2019s human nature. The American dream is one thing, while men and women are flesh and blood and real. All we can do is try to avoid those mistakes in the future. You know the famous quote about learning from history or else being doomed to repeat it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. She was interesting, reasonable...and, yes, charming. Fun to be with.</p><p>He realized it wasn\u2019t a sudden desire for his company that had her stalling, dragging her feet, walking slowly. She seemed loath to go in the direction of her house.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, nothing. I was thinking maybe I\u2019d go to the Tarleton-Dandridge House with you now.\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid the intriguing Cherry Addison will step in\u2014and give me incorrect information. Or that she\u2019ll convince me the ghosts of her ancestors are running around and our investigation would make a great TV show.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a stern glare. \u201cYou wanted me to talk. You wanted my opinion on people there. You want to know about the history of the house. I\u2019m too keyed up to sleep, so I\u2019ll come back with you, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m a big believer in plunging right in.\u201d</p><p>He kept a smile in place.</p><p>He wondered what was going on with her. The last thing she really wanted to do, he thought, was to go to the Tarleton-Dandridge House with him.</p><p>She just didn\u2019t want to go home. Why?</p><p>She was surprised that he hadn\u2019t come right out and demanded to know what she was lying about.</p> <p>But he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She sounded like a liar to herself, and she was seriously worried about her sanity.</p><p>What a choice!</p><p>Home\u2014where Julian Mitchell might suddenly appear to be sitting in the chair by her sofa. Or the Tarleton-Dandridge House with Tyler Montague.</p><p>Montague was alive. That meant he won.</p><p>The question was, how long could she pretend to be helping him at the house?</p><p>She\u2019d already been through the crime scene. The idea of walking through it again just made her feel numb.</p><p>They went into the mudroom and then the foyer. The entry was large, which was convenient when they were doing tours. People could disperse and look into the different rooms so they weren\u2019t all trying to crowd into one area at the same time.</p><p>\u201cHere we are,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you sleeping?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThe master bedroom. I\u2019m the first one here, so I get first choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a rope bed. The quilt on it is from the 1800s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe quilt is safely in a closet. I brought sheets and a blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the rest of your people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come with bedding, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs well,\u201d Allison repeated. \u201cAs well as cameras and all their ghost-hunting equipment,\u201d she said scornfully.</p><p>He stopped and turned to her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you find us laughable. My unit has an extraordinary record of solving every case we\u2019ve been brought in on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere really isn\u2019t a case here\u2014I mean, not worthy of your effort. I can\u2019t see how there could be.\u201d She thought she must have sounded desperate and tried to calm her voice. \u201cThere is nothing in that attic. Nothing worth taking. I keep thinking that Julian had to be playing a prank and it got the best of him. Who knows, maybe he thought he\u2019d create a mystery for us, and that I\u2019d find him in the study playing Beast Bradley and he\u2019d scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat may be the case,\u201d Tyler said mildly. \u201cIf so, we won\u2019t be here long. Look, Allison, there\u2019ve been a lot of deaths in this house.\u201d</p><p>She unfastened the red velvet cord that sectioned off the period sofa and sank into it. \u201cIt\u2019s an old house,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cPeople die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the natural deaths, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe unnatural ones, like the poor kid who electrocuted himself?\u201d Allison asked. \u201cSam Daily. That was eight years ago. I never met him. I was a college student back then, working occasionally on my breaks. There is no real protection against human stupidity. He started ripping out wires and got an electric shock. That\u2019s what happens.\u201d She winced, remembering. They\u2019d shut down the house then, too. But only for a few days.</p><p>\u201cYou were here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, I never saw the student\u2014or the police or anyone. It was horrible, tragic. As tragic as when a spring-breaker gets drunk and goes over a balcony at a Florida hotel. Everyone felt terrible, especially for the parents. When we came back to work...it was uncomfortable. And still, there was nothing any of us could have done, and certainly nothing that any form of law enforcement could have done. He thought he could trip the alarm and play games in the house. A live wire killed him. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say you should know more.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a hand. \u201cThe thing is, that kind of tragedy could have happened anywhere. There\u2019s no reason to assume that ghosts are running around this house. People can do crazy things, and sometimes they pay horrible consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, that\u2019s true.\u201d Tyler took a seat next to her. \u201cWhat about the other incidents?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She cast him a wry glance. \u201cI wasn\u2019t alive when Bill Hall fell down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngela Wilson?\u201d</p><p>She felt a little pang squeeze her heart. \u201cI loved Angie. She was so knowledgeable and she was the grand matriarch here. I knew her from when I was really young. She encouraged me to love history and books and...she was a role model for me. She had a wonderful career, wrote several fantastic historical novels, married a great guy and had kids. She was seventy-two\u2014not old at all these days, and in great shape. But she had a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured just as softly.</p><p>He rose. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a walk around the house and make sure all the doors are closed and the windows are secure and ready for the alarm, so I can go right to sleep when I get back. Then I\u2019ll stroll on over to your house with you and pick up my car. I\u2019m exhausted. You must be, too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He stood up and started for the stairs.</p><p>Allison was dismayed to realize that she wanted to call him back. She wanted to leap to her feet and go with him.</p><p>She was terrified of being alone.</p><p>Somehow, she managed to stay seated.</p><p>As his footsteps disappeared up the stairs, she got up, too. She couldn\u2019t sit still\u2014and she didn\u2019t want to go home.</p><p>Check into a hotel? That was ridiculous!</p><p>But it was better than going home. Thankfully, she knew some good therapists and she\u2019d go see one first thing in the morning.</p><p>All she had to do was get through the night.</p><p>\u201cAllison!\u201d</p><p>She heard the whisper of her name, but denied it to herself.</p><p>The sound came again, more urgent.</p><p>\u201cAllison, please!\u201d</p><p>She turned and there he was, Julian Mitchell, still in period costume, in the doorway that led to Angus Tarleton\u2019s study.</p><p>She backed away from him. She backed up so far that she couldn\u2019t move any farther; she could feel the sofa against her legs.</p><p>Julian Mitchell came toward her.</p><p>Once again, it was too much.</p><p>This time, she didn\u2019t hurt herself. She passed out onto the period sofa that sat just inside the entry of the Tarleton-Dandridge House.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t think he\u2019d taken that long to walk around and assure himself that the house was secure.</p><p>He must have been longer than he\u2019d thought.</p><p>When he returned to the foyer, Allison was stretched out on the sofa, sound asleep. He gazed down at her for a moment. Maybe she\u2019d awaken soon. He hated to rouse her when she\u2019d been through so much and was so exhausted.</p><p>There was more work he could do in the study; he decided he\u2019d get to it and wait for her to wake up.</p><p>He ran upstairs and got a pillow\u2014one he\u2019d brought himself, with a twenty-first-century pillowcase bought at Target\u2014and slipped it beneath her head. On second thought, he went back up and returned with a blanket. When he\u2019d covered her, he went into Angus Tarleton\u2019s study.</p><p>While he continued to read about the people involved with the house throughout its history, he found that he was continually distracted. Looking up at the painting of Beast Bradley, he knew why.</p><p>The portrait didn\u2019t bother him. It was the work of an excellent artist, someone capable of imbuing a painting with character. He\u2019d shown a handsome man steeped in cruelty, a portrayal that was so different from the painting in Lucy Tarleton\u2019s room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Granted, the one in the study had been executed by a Dandridge. Did that mean anything? Naturally, the Dandridges hated the man who\u2019d caused the death of Lucy Tarleton, Sophia Dandridge\u2019s sister. And Bradley had probably brought so much misery to Angus Tarleton that he\u2019d died years earlier than he should have.</p><p>So what exactly was the truth about Beast Bradley? Did his infatuation with Lucy turn him into a monster or had history been written by the victors\u2014the patriots in this case? Maybe he\u2019d been nothing more than human, having virtues along with his faults.</p><p>Then again, how did anyone forgive a man who\u2019d cut the throat of a young woman in her own parlor?</p> <p>The house seemed silent. Nothing even seemed to shift. He yawned, exhausted, then went back out to the parlor.</p><p>Allison Leigh was still sleeping soundly.</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>He touched her shoulder. She didn\u2019t awaken.</p><p>She looked young and vulnerable lying there, and angelically beautiful. Her dark hair was sleek and lustrous against the crimson velvet of the sofa; her long lashes swept ivory cheeks.</p> <p>\u201cAllison?\u201d He shook her slightly but she still didn\u2019t wake.</p><p>Perplexed, Tyler straightened, studying her for a minute or two.</p><p>It probably wouldn\u2019t look proper to leave her sleeping there. But...they were living in the modern world. He was going upstairs, she was downstairs, and he really didn\u2019t give a damn what people said. She lived alone, and he was pretty sure she didn\u2019t have to answer to anyone.</p><p>\u201cSleep tight,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He walked the stairs up to the second floor, heading for the master bedroom.</p><p>He paused to glance at the other painting of Beast Bradley. Here, there was strength in the eyes, but not that expression of brutal cunning and cruelty.</p> <p>\u201cTalk to me?\u201d he offered.</p><p>But the house was silent.</p><p>He went on to bed, open to the spirits who might roam the house.</p><p>That night, none of them chose to appear.</p><p>Allison woke with a start.</p><p>She sat up, feeling lost. Then she noticed the blanket around her and turned to see the pillow she\u2019d slept on. She looked around, realizing she was in the foyer of the Tarleton-Dandridge House. She remembered seeing Julian and she remembered passing out.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be here. She\u2019d imagined Julian last night; he was on her mind. She was near the place where he\u2019d died. She had been an idiot to come here.</p><p>Now she had to go.</p> <p>She rose just as Tyler Montague came walking through from the salon doorway, a cup of coffee in his hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s black. Hope that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t use cream or sugar so I hadn\u2019t bought any yet. I didn\u2019t disturb anything historical. I made it in the pot you keep in your docents\u2019 room. You all might have cream and sugar in there somewhere? I didn\u2019t prowl through anyone\u2019s things,\u201d he said, offering her the cup.</p><p>She nodded and accepted the cup numbly.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, slept here all night?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cUnless you woke up and went tearing around the historic district while I was sleeping,\u201d he said. \u201cEnjoying the wild nightlife.\u201d</p><p>She ignored his attempt at levity. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see or hear anything...odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, no, no. I must\u2019ve been so tired... I\u2019m sorry. I need to leave now. I have\u2014I\u2019m going to have a doctor\u2019s appointment.\u201d</p><p>She gulped down a huge sip of the coffee, which was hot. She coughed but didn\u2019t scald her mouth, thank God.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Tyler took the cup from her while she caught her breath. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Embarrassed. I was just so tired. Thanks for the pillow and the blanket. You should have woken me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. You were out like a light,\u201d he told her.</p><p>You\u2019ll never know how much! she thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d She took the coffee cup from him and drank more carefully, then pushed it back in his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later!\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Allison tried not to run to the door. When she reached it, she remembered that an alarm was set. She keyed in the numbers to let herself out.</p><p>At the gate, she did the same thing. She didn\u2019t look back. She ran down the street, not sure at first what she was doing or even what time it was, just desperate to get away from the Tarleton-Dandridge House.</p><p>Eventually, she slowed her gait. She finally checked her watch and saw that it was still early\u2014not yet seven. She\u2019d go home and shower, then show up at the university\u2019s medical buildings and hope that a professor friend, a psychiatrist, would be able to see her.</p><p>At her house, she paused, fumbling in her handbag for her keys. She didn\u2019t want to go into the house alone.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t go anywhere in the clothes she\u2019d been wearing all day and all night. Determined, she slipped her key into the lock and went inside. Still, it took her a minute to go farther than the doorway.</p><p>She started talking out loud. \u201cJulian, I\u2019m taking a shower. There will be no crazy stuff going on now, okay? I do not see you and I will not see you. You are a product of my imagination.\u201d</p><p>She ran through the front of the house and up the stairs to her bedroom, looking straight ahead all the while. She showered as quickly as she could, dropping the soap several times when it fell through her trembling fingers.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if her shirt matched her jeans and she didn\u2019t care. Besides, did it matter what shirt was worn with a pair of jeans? She was so terrified she just about fell down the stairs, but she was almost there, almost out of the house.</p><p>She had to try twice to get the door open. When she did, she turned back. She could see the top of a head above the upholstered wingback chair.</p><p>A hand rose.</p><p>She clearly heard Julian say, \u201cI\u2019ll be here when you get back.\u201d</p><p>6</p><p>Allison drove directly to the university. Once she\u2019d parked, she headed for the medical compound and found Dr. Marty Hanson, who was a practicing psychiatrist.</p><p>Marty said it probably wasn\u2019t the best thing to work together, since they were friends. But she was able to send Allison to a colleague she admired, Dr. Rudy Blount, who was a short, friendly man in his early fifties with wire-rimmed spectacles and a balding head. He asked Allison to make herself comfortable. No, she didn\u2019t have to lie down on the sofa but she was welcome to do so. She could also just sit and talk to him from an armchair.</p><p>Allison opted for the armchair and a conversational approach. Dr. Blount was personable. They talked about their mutual love of the city and discussed issues in the news. He asked about her daily life; he knew that, like Marty, she taught at the university. He assured her that anything she said was completely and totally confidential.</p><p>Finally, Allison released a deep breath and explained her problem.</p><p>She told him about finding Julian\u2014and then seeing him in her house.</p><p>\u201cIs it stress?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s stress,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s most likely stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never believed in ghosts,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He folded his hands and set them in his lap. \u201cGhosts. Well, what are ghosts, Ms. Leigh? Maybe they\u2019re memories. Maybe they\u2019re images we create in our minds. Maybe they\u2019re reminders that we should have done something, but didn\u2019t. Tell me, were you feeling any guilt about your friend Julian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t feeling guilty about Julian. He was always showing up late and we\u2014the group of us\u2014were always covering his ass!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel you need to defend yourself in any way over his death? Do you think you could have saved him somehow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not feeling defensive. I would\u2019ve done anything to save him, but the second I saw him, I knew he was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you check for a pulse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never touched him. I called the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you waited were you frightened that something would happen to you?\u201d</p><p>Allison shook her head. She hadn\u2019t felt that at all. \u201cNo, no...it looked as if he\u2019d just sat down...wrong. You know how people rest their elbows on a table and their chins on their hands? Well, it\u2019s as if he thought he had a table and the bayonet was his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sad, and terrible for Julian, and for you. At this point, it has to be difficult to understand what you\u2019re feeling. Guilt is an interesting emotion. It was fine to be angry with him while he was alive, but now that he\u2019s dead, you may feel guilty about that anger without being aware of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think I feel guilty. Whenever he left us in the lurch, we were always honest about it. He\u2019d know we were angry because we\u2019d tell him, and he\u2019d apologize and promise not to do it again. He also said that when he made it big, he\u2019d never forget us or leave us behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like the young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a friend, definitely. When we were away from work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever had a feeling like this before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA feeling like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat someone\u2019s still with you. Someone dead. A spirit\u2014a ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Allison shook her head. \u201cBut now...I\u2019m afraid to be in my own house. I slept on a sofa at the Tarleton-Dandridge last night because I was afraid to go home. No, that\u2019s a lie. I didn\u2019t start out sleeping. I passed out. Because I saw Julian. I was with one of the FBI men\u2014Agent Montague, who wants my help with the history and the people there\u2014and when he went to check on the windows, doors, alarm system, all that, Julian suddenly appeared. And the next thing I knew I was sinking, the world went black, and then I woke up this morning feeling like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe agent didn\u2019t come to help you?\u201d Dr. Blount asked in obvious surprise.</p><p>\u201cHe thought I\u2019d fallen asleep. He gave me a pillow and a blanket,\u201d she said dryly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the police have crime tape around the Tarleton-Dandridge House? When the tragedy was announced on the news, the reporter said the place was going to be closed for a few weeks,\u201d Dr. Blount said.</p><p>\u201cYes, they\u2019ve closed the house. But the police\u2014or the directors or someone\u2014brought in a federal team that\u2019s investigating the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see. That\u2019s why you were with an agent. A federal agent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Dr. Blount said.</p><p>\u201cAh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have something against the federal government investigation? It doesn\u2019t sound as if you approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t approve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone making a mockery of the Tarleton-Dandridge House\u2014with people running around and filmmakers making everyone\u2019s eyes look like those of a deer caught in the headlights. And going \u2018What\u2019s that? Did you hear that?\u2019 whenever a floorboard creaks. Please! Have you seen those shows? I think one of the educational channels used to do them with actors re-creating what happened in the past, and using lights to make a place seem spooky. Then they\u2019ll have people walk through the building screaming now and then. It\u2019s not fair to the historical integrity of the house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFBI agents film their investigations with special lights?\u201d He seemed puzzled.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey publicize what they\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve read up on these particular agents. They\u2019re called in when there\u2019s something unusual. Unusual to them, from what I\u2019ve read, means paranormal. And we\u2019re dealing with history here. Sacred ground. Old Philadelphia is the site of some of the most momentous events in our nation\u2019s past.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree. But filming\u2014for the public. Do you think these people are going to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they\u2019re bringing in equipment to monitor the house during the night. And maybe during the day, too. I know that everything about this government agency is kept as quiet as possible, but information leaks out and other units of the FBI consider them \u2018special.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Dr. Blount smiled. \u201cMaybe you believe you know all this but it\u2019s not quite what\u2019s going on. And maybe you resent these people so much because you\u2019re afraid of seeing something you don\u2019t want to see\u2014like Julian Mitchell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think? That it\u2019s stress over Julian\u2019s death and the fact that I don\u2019t really trust these people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I think! That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an old joke that a patient talks and a psychiatrist listens and asks over and over again if that\u2019s what he or she thinks. But the human mind is complex, and in the absence of actual mental illness, we rule our own thoughts. I can give you a medication\u2014a mild one\u2014that\u2019ll help you sleep until this is over. You probably need to come to terms with what\u2019s happening in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend died,\u201d she said softly.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s hard enough to accept. You know the stages of grief, I\u2019m sure\u2014denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, finally, acceptance. We all go through these feelings. You found the young man and you were horrified and perhaps tried to deny that what you saw could be true. You\u2019re angry he\u2019s dead, and that may be manifesting in the way you feel about a government group coming into the Tarleton-Dandridge House. Seeing this young man in your house may be your way of bargaining\u2014he\u2019s not really dead if you can see him. And we\u2019re all depressed when we hear about the loss of someone young, someone who shouldn\u2019t have died. I think, once you accept what\u2019s happened, you\u2019ll begin to heal. But no one can really rush the stages of grief. We all go through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019m seeing Julian in my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you believe?\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing. \u201cHonestly, I want you to tell me that I am seeing him in my own mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you believe that, will it help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmeasurably!\u201d</p><p>Dr. Blount grinned. \u201cDo you want to go it alone? Or would like a sleep medication?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate taking pills unless I have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t want a prescription?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I definitely want one!\u201d</p><p>Allison wasn\u2019t sure what she felt when she left Dr. Blount\u2019s office; she knew he\u2019d rearranged his schedule to see her, and she was grateful, but their visit hadn\u2019t really helped her.</p><p>She wished he\u2019d just said, \u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Ghosts don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s all in your head.\u201d</p><p>And now, of course, the problem was that, once again, she didn\u2019t want to go home.</p><p>Julian had told her he\u2019d be waiting.</p><p>Ethan Oxford lived in another historic house. His was on Walnut Street.</p><p>The board was ready to meet in Ethan\u2019s dining room. Originally, Tyler thought, the place had been designed so that it could also function as a ballroom. A large period table was in the center of the room, and the walls were covered with portraits of historic figures.</p><p>Dolley Madison held pride of place against the far wall.</p><p>Oxford was a dignified man. His white hair, beard and mustache were perfectly groomed. He was gracious as he answered the door himself, setting an arm around Tyler\u2019s shoulders as he led him toward the dining room. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, young man, I\u2019m the one who insisted we call Adam Harrison. He and I go way back. We\u2019ve served on the boards of many fine charities together and I\u2019ve known many people Adam has helped. Discreetly, of course. Now, I\u2019m not saying the young man\u2019s death wasn\u2019t completely accidental, but what with that fellow being in the hospital, as well...I think the house needs investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir, it\u2019s usually worth some research when there\u2019ve been a number of...accidents,\u201d Tyler agreed.</p><p>Oxford stood back, grinning at Tyler. \u201cYou\u2019re not what I was expecting. You actually look like a real lawman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cWell, come on in. The others are waiting.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d met Cherry the night before, of course. This morning she gushed over him as if they were long lost friends. Nathan Pierson seemed intrigued to meet him. Sarah Vining gave him a limp hand. He had the feeling that she wasn\u2019t one to create waves. He remembered that Allison had told him Sarah reminded her of an abused pup at a shelter.</p><p>\u201cCoffee?\u201d Oxford asked him. It was already set out in a silver carafe.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>He accepted a cup and the seat that was offered to him. The others joined him at one end of the massive table.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you discovered so far?\u201d Oxford asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cSo far, I\u2019m studying the house and delving into what happened to bring me here,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI made a point of removing the reproduction bedding from the room I\u2019m using, which we\u2019ll be careful to do everywhere. I understand how many objects in the house are priceless, and we will take extreme care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is haunted. You found that out, right?\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cRemnants of the past always remain in a place where the passions of history ran high, Mrs. Addison. I don\u2019t believe that a ghost rummaged through the office in the attic or caused Mr. Mitchell to die. But we will find out what did, whether it was accidental or manufactured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cManufactured. What does that mean?\u201d Pierson asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cCaused by a person or persons unknown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear! He couldn\u2019t have been...murdered!\u201d Sarah Vining cried.</p><p>\u201cThere, there, Sarah,\u201d Oxford said in a comforting voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty unusual for someone to set his chin on a bayonet,\u201d Tyler explained. \u201cAnd a few of the events that have occurred in the past definitely pose a unique challenge. Here\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one wants the public to start believing that the house is dangerously haunted. We all know that a good ghost story draws people, but they don\u2019t want to think there\u2019s something really evil about a house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing evil about the Tarleton-Dandridge House,\u201d Cherry protested. \u201cWe have a poignant love story, and a beautiful woman who haunts the house. Why, the ghost tours would go out of business if the house were to blow away!\u201d</p><p>Tyler doubted that; Cherry seemed to think the house was the most important building in the historic city. But he lowered his head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cMy team can go through the house quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so! The newspapers have gotten wind of that man in the hospital\u2014and his son swears the portrait of Beast Bradley put him there!\u201d Sarah spoke tremulously. \u201cI hate this! If there\u2019s anything you can do to restore our wonderful piece of the past to total respectability, we\u2019ll greatly appreciate it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remind you, Agent Montague, I\u2019m here to help if you need me,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all here. We\u2019ve asked these people in because of the gossip that was already going around the city. And now this,\u201d Ethan said, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cGossip?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cI called Adam the second I heard what happened because of the other deaths in the house.\u201d Oxford shook his head again. \u201cPeople are saying one event could be an accident, but...a docent? A college student? And now...a docent again. Or a guide, what have you. And on top of that, someone rummaging through the attic. Why, we were all there right before young Mr. Mitchell died\u2014and right before that attic was raided. Will you be able to tell if Mr. Mitchell was distressed in some way...if there was a reason he might have torn the attic apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll certainly be looking into that. What I need to know from all of you is whether you have any idea why someone would be searching for something in that attic. And what that might be.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He surveyed the table. They all stared back at him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cThe house has had a thorough history done, which was easy because it went from the original family directly into the hands of the Old Philly organization.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn oral history,\u201d Tyler said politely.</p> <p>Cherry sat up very straight. \u201cWould you suggest my family were liars, Agent Montague?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Mrs. Addison,\u201d Tyler assured her. \u201cBut oral history can be like the whispering game. Tell a friend, who tells a friend, and by the time they\u2019ve told several friends, the story has changed. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not implying that\u2019s the case.\u201d He rose; he\u2019d been hoping to learn something he didn\u2019t know or couldn\u2019t access in his files. They were all looking to him for answers when he\u2019d just arrived and was still figuring it out.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think our guide\u2014Ms. Leigh\u2014might have, er, helped Mr. Mitchell die, do you?\u201d Cherry asked.</p><p>Tyler was startled by the question. Maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been. Despite Allison\u2019s obvious grief at the loss of a colleague, the police had questioned her long enough.</p><p>He reminded himself that he barely knew Allison Leigh.</p> <p>But he also had a good sense of people; he was seldom fooled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Julian Mitchell was a physically fit man. It\u2019s unlikely that even as a friend, joking around with him, she could have forced his chin down on that bayonet,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Nathan frowned. \u201cCherry, that was horrible! To say such a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Ethan said, drumming his fingers on the table, \u201cwhoever trashed the attic might have been looking for Allison\u2019s research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan, don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Cherry said, waving a beautifully manicured hand in the air. \u201cHer so-called research sheds no new light on anything. She\u2019s found a few quotes and notations we didn\u2019t know about. She has nothing new.\u201d Cherry paused. \u201cShe did mention to me that she wanted to take a research trip to Valley Forge. She\u2019s been communicating with some professor there who claims he owns letters written by Lucy Tarleton. I highly doubt this and I warned Allison he\u2019s probably a fraud or the letters were faked, but I believe she still meant to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Cherry didn\u2019t exactly roll her eyes, but her opinion of the unnamed professor\u2019s research was evident.</p> <p>Tyler stood and said, \u201cWell, Mrs. Addison, here\u2019s the thing about history. It belongs to everyone and it\u2019s not immutable. History changes when new facts emerge or when attitudes change\u2014views on slavery being an obvious example. So I assume Ms. Leigh will follow where her research leads. Thank you all for your time and your faith. We\u2019ll keep you advised of every move we make and, of course, anything we\u2019re able to determine.\u201d</p><p>Oxford and Pierson stood politely when Tyler did. He could tell they were going to talk about him when he was gone. That was all right; he\u2019d learned from them what he could.</p><p>The rest of his Krewe would be arriving by nightfall. He returned to the house and did an inventory of the employees\u2019 work area, not wanting to infringe on anyone\u2019s private property, but figuring out the best way to make the place habitable. There was a small refrigerator, a microwave and a coffeepot. Not much, but it would do, especially since they were located in the heart of the historic district, which placed them in the middle of restaurant heaven.</p><p>Making a mental list of a few supplies to pick up, he left the house and walked over to Allison\u2019s, about half a mile away. Passing through the historic district, he listened to the sounds of excitement from parents, couples and children, all thrilled to see the famous Liberty Bell and walk through Independence Hall.</p><p>He understood Allison\u2019s deep passion for Philadelphia and its history. He often felt that the greatest achievement of American democracy had been freedom of speech and of the press, freedoms that could be abused at times and yet were necessary for a true government of the people.</p><p>With that thought in mind, he found himself thinking again of the two different paintings of Beast Bradley. It was remarkable what one man saw that another didn\u2019t. And each had the right to his own views.</p><p>He tried Allison\u2019s door; she didn\u2019t answer. He tried her cell phone next but got her answering machine. He left a message, asking her to give him a call.</p><p>After that, he stopped at the hospital. The children weren\u2019t there today but Haley Dixon was sitting by her husband\u2019s side, holding his hand. She didn\u2019t see Tyler at first and he felt a hard tug at his heartstrings\u2014no relationship in the world was perfect, he knew that. But the love and tenderness in Haley\u2019s eyes as she watched her husband, her hand curled around his, was beautiful.</p> <p>He prayed that Dixon would recover even as he wondered whether the man\u2019s condition could possibly have anything to do with the Tarleton-Dandridge House.</p><p>Haley Dixon must have heard him then because she turned toward him. Her eyes were damp, but she smiled. She gently released her husband\u2019s hand and walked over to join him at the door.</p><p>\u201cAny change?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re still waiting for the test results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are the boys?\u201d</p><p>Haley shrugged apologetically. \u201cTodd\u2019s convinced that a ghost did this to his father. But he\u2019s also convinced that Ms. Leigh can do something about it, and he believes in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could promise you that all we had to do was talk to a ghost and everything would be all right. But I can promise you that I have a team coming in tonight and we\u2019ll do everything possible to find out if there were any factors at the house that could have caused this.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cAll the other tourists and docents are okay\u2014\u201d She broke off and grimaced. \u201cExcept for the young man who died, of course. Do you think there could be some kind of toxin? Mold in the walls, lead, anything that might be responsible for this? Something Artie\u2019s allergic to, maybe, that doesn\u2019t affect most people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGovernment regulations are pretty stringent, but you never know what might\u2019ve been missed. We\u2019ll keep at it.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly stood on tiptoe to plant a kiss on his cheek. She flushed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that a lot of people would think we\u2019re ridiculous for believing the house could have caused any of this, and I want you to know that I\u2014we, all of us\u2014are grateful for your concern and anything you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kiss on the cheek is never anything to apologize for,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll check back with you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the hospital, Tyler headed to the police station. So far, the police had gained nothing from their forensic investigation of the house or the attic. The prints they\u2019d lifted all belonged to those who worked there and, presumably, tourists. There\u2019d been an abundance of prints with no matches in the databases. The medical examiner had yet to make a ruling on Julian Mitchell\u2019s death, and it might be several days before he was able to do so.</p><p>Detective Jenson looked sad as usual, a little world-weary, but like the faithful old bloodhound he so resembled, ready to take on the world. \u201cI would\u2019ve given you a call in the next hour or so. I\u2019d asked the board of directors to keep everyone out of the attic until we\u2019d processed some of our information, but now we need someone back in there. Someone associated with the house. It might just have been mischief, but the only way we\u2019ll discover who created the mess up in the Tarleton-Dandridge attic is to discover if anything\u2019s missing. Everyone I\u2019ve spoken with is totally mystified. Nathan Pierson said he was pretty sure no one would find any illegal substances. Now, as I say, I\u2019d like to get one of the historical staff back in there. To be honest, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a priority for the department if it weren\u2019t for the dead boy\u2014and the fact that the medical examiner hasn\u2019t made any kind of statement.\u201d Detective Jenson paused for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m surprised they\u2019ve got the feds on something like this, although I have heard a little about your group. Got to admit I don\u2019t quite understand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Those of us involved don\u2019t always understand it, either, but we get results,\u201d Tyler said. He liked Jenson and liked dealing with him. The man didn\u2019t seem at all territorial and didn\u2019t argue with someone else taking care of a crime that might have been a prank and a murder that might have been an accident.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bring Ms. Leigh back in to start putting the attic in order. She\u2019s apparently more or less in charge of the other guides,\u201d Tyler told him. \u201cShe can decide whether to bring in her coworkers.\u201d</p><p>Jenson nodded. He glanced down, his expression strange, and then he looked up at Tyler again. \u201cIt was the damnedest thing. Finding that young man\u2014it almost looked as if he was resting his chin on the musket except that the bayonet had gone through his chin and there was blood everywhere. His eyes were still wide open and he was staring at the wall. I have to tell you, I\u2019ve seen a lot in my years on the force here, but that young man...\u201d His voice trailed off and then he focused on Tyler and shrugged. \u201cNothing wrong with the feds taking over on this, not the way I see it.\u201d</p><p>Tyler thanked him for his help and left the station. He called Allison\u2019s cell on his way but she didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>She\u2019d probably seen his name on her caller ID.</p><p>After going to the store, he\u2019d stop by her place before returning to the Tarleton-Dandridge House.</p><p>Allison went to Starbucks and ordered a latte with two extra shots, since it might not be easy to stay awake today.</p><p>She hovered there, wishing she\u2019d had the presence of mind to bring her laptop or iPad, anything she might have played with so she could have joined those casually enjoying their coffee.</p><p>There was only so long she could linger. She felt restless.</p><p>What she needed was a shot of courage, not just caffeine. She\u2019d seen Dr. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Blount and now she really had to go home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But despite her stern resolution, she parked her car in the driveway at her house and then wandered the historic district, staying away from the walk down Chestnut that would bring her back to the Tarleton-Dandridge.</p><p>Hovering near Independence Hall, staring up at the redbrick building that still brought her a little thrill every time she saw it, she heard a teenage boy talking to another.</p><p>\u201cMe! I\u2019d be Patrick Henry, if I was a founding father! He was cool. He was so fierce. He stood right in that building and said, \u2018Give me liberty or give me death!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Allison winced, wondering if she should play the eternal teacher and tell the boy that Patrick Henry had indeed said those words but not at Independence Hall. He\u2019d spoken his fiery rhetoric to the Virginia Convention at St. John\u2019s Church in Richmond.</p><p>She was startled when the teen shivered as though he\u2019d felt a sudden blast of cold air. Then he turned and stared at Allison, not as if he\u2019d known she was there, but as if he\u2019d been searching for someone\u2014anyone\u2014to be near him.</p><p>He seemed about sixteen, a handsome kid, the kind teenage girls would definitely find appealing.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said, frowning as he looked at her. The brother or friend he was with seemed troubled, as well.</p><p>\u201cHi. Where are you from?\u201d Allison asked him.</p> <p>He made a face. \u201cIndiana.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Indiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in a cornfield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we need corn. By the way, I was listening to you, and I\u2019m a huge Patrick Henry fan, too. But guess what? Although I love Philly and I\u2019d like to think most of our brilliant quotes come from speeches here, he said those words in Richmond, Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d The boy didn\u2019t seem angry about being corrected. \u201cMaybe that explains it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplains what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cold?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I felt something cold touch me when I said it. Hey, maybe Patrick Henry is running around here!\u201d he said happily. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s a ghost, and he didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s buried at Red Hill, in Virginia, his family home, the last place he lived. It\u2019s beautiful there. If I were Patrick Henry and still running around, I think I\u2019d be there. He really loved Virginia and, back then, they were \u2018statesmen.\u2019 The events at Independence Hall turned the Colonies into states and the states into a nation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard about that,\u201d the other boy said. \u201cI heard the politicians fought back. That Thomas Jefferson had a hard time writing the Declaration of Independence and that he had to word it so all the representatives from all the colonies would be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Can you imagine trying to do that today? Back then, there were only thirteen states. Now we have fifty,\u201d Allison said. She was surprised the boys were listening to her, and she was happy they were old enough to be exploring on their own\u2014and that they seemed to care about history. She also liked their companionship at the moment. She found she could even smile and say, \u201cHmm, maybe if anyone\u2019s running around here, it\u2019s Gouverneur Morris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGovernor who?\u201d the younger one asked.</p><p>\u201cNot governor. Gouverneur. That was the man\u2019s name,\u201d Allison said. \u201cHe was born in New York City but he spent a lot of time here, helping to form the nation. While Thomas Jefferson was drafting the Declaration of Independence, Morris was busy working on the Constitution. He was an interesting man, if you want to look up one of the founding fathers who isn\u2019t as well known as Jefferson or Patrick Henry. He lost out a few times for trying to create a more centralized government. While many of the others were thinking mostly about states\u2019 rights, Morris already saw that we needed to band together to really make things work. He was antislavery, as were most of the founding fathers, but that was one issue they were afraid to touch just then. In his later life, he was a peg-legged old curmudgeon, but he was pretty remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to be in government,\u201d the younger boy said. \u201cFirst, I\u2019d make a law that everybody has to be nice to everyone else, no matter where they came from. Because the United States is made up of people who came from other places, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and that\u2019s very commendable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d stop them from killing whales and wolves and baby seals, and I\u2019d make people use their blinkers when they\u2019re driving!\u201d</p><p>Allison started to laugh at that, but the laughter died in her throat. She blinked. Someone was strolling across the grounds, coming toward Independence Hall, wearing a period costume.</p><p>It was Julian Mitchell. She could see him plainly, just as she\u2019d seen him in her home and at the Tarleton-Dandridge House.</p><p>He stood behind the boys.</p><p>\u201cI really have to talk to you,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease, Allison.\u201d</p><p>She felt herself growing dizzy, darkness encroaching. She fought the feeling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not there,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou are a product of my stressed-out imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d the boy said. \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m Toby Gray. This is my buddy, Hudson.\u201d</p><p>The kids looked at her, visibly frightened.</p><p>Of course. There was a dead man standing behind them.</p><p>No, the kids were afraid of her!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Allison,\u201d she said, trying to be polite. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>She turned and hurried in the direction of her house.</p><p>She felt the cold follow her.</p><p>Allison began to move more quickly. By the time she got home, she was running. She\u2019d left the gates to the driveway and the front walk open, and she tore along the path, nearly tripping up the steps to her porch.</p><p>Her fingers shook when she put the key in the lock. She burst into the house, slammed the door and leaned against it. A sigh of relief escaped her as she looked toward the plush wingback chair in her parlor. There was no one there.</p><p>For several long moments she continued to lean against the door, breathing hard. As last, she walked toward the kitchen. Her hands were shaking when she took the bottle of whiskey from the cabinet. Pouring a shot, she drank it down in a flash.</p><p>And then she saw him again. He walked through the door. He didn\u2019t open it to come in; he just appeared inside, coming toward her once again.</p><p>She poured another shot. The whiskey dripped over her fingers and sloshed around in the glass. She managed to get some in, and swallowed the second shot.</p><p>\u201cAllison, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can say please all you want. I don\u2019t see you! You are a product of my imagination, of your terrible death\u2014what the hell were you doing, Julian? No, I don\u2019t see you. I can\u2019t see you. I don\u2019t mean to be cruel but you\u2019re dead and you\u2019re lying in the morgue and they won\u2019t even release your body yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, quit talking to me! Get out of my mind. I was good to you, Julian. You were a jerk and I\u2019m a nice person and I covered for you. We all did. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re not going to live to be a rich and famous drummer and lead vocalist. Maybe you can do that in someone else\u2019s mind. Please, please, get out of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison\u2014\u201d</p><p>She poured another shot of whiskey, staring at him, gulping it down.</p><p>Ignore him. Just ignore him.</p><p>She walked out of the kitchen, stumbling against the wall. He only existed in her imagination, of course, but she gave him a wide berth, circling around him. Going over to her entertainment system, she turned on the television. She hit a Philly educational channel that was showing a reenactment of a meeting at Independence Hall.</p><p>The people in it were all dressed like Julian. She changed the channel, and then flicked it to music, playing a classic Beatles CD.</p><p>That done, she felt her knees grow weak. Her stomach was burning, her head spinning. She didn\u2019t drink that often and now three large whiskies were shooting through her with wicked repercussions.</p><p>Julian took a seat in the wingback chair again.</p><p>She looked at him and picked up a magazine. \u201cI do not see you. You will go away.\u201d</p><p>She forced her attention onto the magazine. She felt a chill, a movement in the air, and something seemed to touch her knee. She finally raised her head.</p><p>Julian crouched in front of her, one hand resting lightly on her knee. Mesmerized, she gazed into his eyes. Julian had been a good-looking young man with deep green eyes and dark hair that curled over his brow\u2014perfect for new-age rock music and for performing as a historical interpreter. When she wasn\u2019t annoyed with him, she\u2019d always cared about him as she would a younger brother.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Allison, who else can I turn to? Please, see me. Help me.\u201d</p><p>Her tone was husky. \u201cJulian, I can\u2019t help you. You\u2019re dead. I would\u2019ve done anything. I was ready to perform CPR, but I could see from the doorway that...that you were gone. I could see the blood\u2014oh, God, Julian, you hit a vein or an artery. There was so much blood. But you were staring at the wall. And you...\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t go on. Tears stung her eyes. Maybe that was it. She hadn\u2019t been able to really mourn a friend. Maybe she did feel guilty; maybe she felt she could have done more for him in life or prevented his death.</p><p>\u201cJulian, how can I help you now?\u201d she wailed.</p><p>\u201cYou will help me. I know you, Ally. Something in the house isn\u2019t right\u2014and I know you\u2019ll figure out what it is!\u201d</p><p>7</p><p>Tyler was surprised when Allison answered his next call, and more surprised when she said she\u2019d go to the Tarleton-Dandridge House and start straightening up the attic whenever he wished. If he thought she needed help with that, she could call Annette or Jason or both.</p><p>She could have walked over but he was out, anyway, and had the car; he said he\u2019d pick her up. She agreed.</p><p>He was a little shocked when he arrived at her house.</p><p>He tended to think of her as tall, elegant, classically beautiful, but reserved in many ways\u2014as academics were often assumed to be. Of course, he\u2019d first met her when she was costumed and in disarray and exhausted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But tonight...</p><p>She opened the door with a strength that sent it banging against the wall. She watched it happen, then stared at him and grinned. \u201cWhoops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>She looked all right. She was wearing jeans and a tailored shirt with a casual jacket; her hair was brushed\u2014except for a few strands that seemed to be standing straight up on top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI am so-o-o ready to get out of here!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He nodded slowly.</p><p>\u201cOh! I should get my bag.\u201d But she remained standing there.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She turned to head back into the parlor. She bumped into the wall as she did.</p><p>He stepped inside, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cAllison, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Oh, yeah, just fine,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>He caught her by the shoulders when she\u2019d picked up her purse and had come back to join him. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I know you well, but...you really don\u2019t seem to be you this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the new me,\u201d she proclaimed.</p> <p>It hit him then. Not the odor of booze, but rather the potent smell of a minty mouthwash.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all drink. Water, staff of life. Wait, maybe that\u2019s bread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we should start in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, no, I shouldn\u2019t go to bed. I should go with you. Too bad it\u2019s the Tarleton-Dandridge House\u2014actually, too bad it\u2019s anywhere in Philly at the moment. But no, not staying here. Not tonight.\u201d</p><p>She was different. Very different.</p><p>Afraid.</p><p>He was thoughtful as she looked up at him hopefully.</p> <p>\u201cReally, I have to leave here. Now,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cYour people are coming tonight, aren\u2019t they? Your people!\u201d She laughed. \u201cI guess I made that sound as if you\u2019re all part of an alien nation or something. I didn\u2019t mean that. I meant, your coworkers are coming tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re driving up. They\u2019ll probably get here late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to meet them. Lots of people, right? Or several, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, several people,\u201d he said. Tyler thought about the situation, somewhat amused. She wasn\u2019t exactly drunk, but she was pretty darned tipsy. He had a feeling it wasn\u2019t a condition with which she was really comfortable, and he wondered where she\u2019d been or what she\u2019d been doing to bring her to such a state.</p><p>She\u2019d found a dead friend. That would do it for most people. She\u2019d spent the night after finding Julian at the police station, being relentlessly questioned. Surely, her behavior now, her reaction, was quite normal.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll go\u2014first to a nice crowded restaurant with a coffee bar, and then to the house. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>She blinked and then smiled. \u201cRestaurant, yes, that would be great. Food would be good. Oh, yes. Food.\u201d</p><p>He escorted her out onto the porch. \u201cAllow me, please,\u201d he said politely, taking her keys to lock the house.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said with great dignity.</p><p>\u201cI have my car. I was shopping,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ll have to stop by the Tarleton-Dandridge House to drop off a few perishables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>When he got to their destination, she was looking straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to wait in the car?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She raised huge frightened eyes to his. \u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes\u2014if I\u2019m leaving the car and you\u2019re waiting in it, you\u2019d be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out of the car as he reached into the backseat for the one plastic bag that held butter, milk, cheese and eggs.</p><p>She stared at the house.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>She followed him up the path to the house and waited behind him as he opened the door. She kept looking around nervously as if she expected someone to pop out from behind the closet door in the mudroom and shout, \u201cBoo!\u201d</p><p>Inside, he started to tell her he\u2019d only be a minute. But she was right behind him, so close, in fact, that she was nearly touching him. When he walked into their employee room and bent down to open the refrigerator door, he nearly pushed her over by accident.</p><p>He reached out for her when she stumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust fine.\u201d</p><p>She was standing by him with her eyes closed.</p><p>\u201cAll right, we\u2019re leaving now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He started to walk. She followed. She\u2019d opened her eyes but only a slit\u2014just enough not to crash into walls or furniture.</p><p>He decided to let it go for the moment. He felt her behind him\u2014almost on top of him\u2014as they exited the house. \u201cYou okay to walk to the restaurant?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d she said with the indignant tone of one who wasn\u2019t really okay at all.</p><p>He took her arm. She didn\u2019t protest.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many places around here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cSo many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go to your friend\u2019s pub?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head, flushing. \u201cNo, um, somewhere different tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He knew it didn\u2019t matter where they went; she just wanted people to be there. He\u2019d seen an Italian place that looked interesting down a side street and he headed toward it.</p><p>\u201cLuigi\u2019s,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs it any good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure! Warm, friendly, always busy.\u201d</p><p>There were a number of people at the restaurant, but the staff seemed to handle the bustling activity well. They didn\u2019t have to wait more than a minute or two before they were seated at a table with a red checkered cloth.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give the waitress an opportunity to offer them a cocktail or wine. \u201cTwo coffees and waters please.\u201d</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t argue. She told him they prepared an extraordinary eggplant.</p><p>When the bread came, she was happy to devour a piece.</p><p>\u201cDid you eat at all today?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She thought about it for a minute. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell you how to run your life or anything, but if you\u2019re going to swig booze, you really should add food to the mix.\u201d</p><p>She threw him an evil glare but didn\u2019t deny his words.</p><p>\u201cWhat brought this on?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat brought what on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour apparent affair with a booze bottle.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-eight, nearly twenty-nine. A responsible, voting citizen often charged with forming the minds of the coming generation. I am certainly entitled to a drink if I choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. But I get the impression you don\u2019t drink heavily that often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drink heavily,\u201d she told him. \u201cI drank quite casually and lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s rude and personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, all alone, you decided to get smashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not smashed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue\u2014I\u2019ve seen worse. Actually, at various times in my life, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve been worse. It just doesn\u2019t seem to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you don\u2019t really know me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing I can tell you is that booze isn\u2019t going to make it go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake what go away?\u201d she asked, frowning and intense.</p><p>Their server arrived; Allison ordered chicken with broccoli and ziti, while he chose the lasagna. He was glad to see that Allison quickly drank down the water. She set the empty glass on the table and picked up her coffee.</p><p>Tyler leaned toward her, placing his hand on hers. \u201cIt won\u2019t make the demons in your mind go away. They only get more vicious.\u201d</p><p>She jerked her hand back. \u201cI have no demons in my mind. I lost a friend, okay? I was distressed by his death. I\u2019m just having an off moment\u2014or an off hour, or whatever. I\u2019ll be fine. And I don\u2019t know what you want at the Tarleton-Dandridge House. You can\u2019t change the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. But you can discover the truth about it and sometimes the truth about the past can change the present or the future.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her coffee again, then pressed her fingers to her temples.</p><p>\u201cAfter we\u2019ve eaten, if you want, I can walk you back to your house and you can get some sleep,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI want to be where you are.\u201d The last words were tremulous, and somehow, the tone of her voice seemed to seep into his bones, his bloodstream. She was a beautiful woman, tall, slim, elegant. The blue of her eyes seemed like a deep sea, sparkling as if it lay beneath a brilliant sun. He couldn\u2019t help being affected.</p><p>Tyler raised his brows, studying her. He knew he was attractive to the opposite sex, but he was sure she hadn\u2019t suddenly decided that she cared for him and would be lost without him by her side. Something had unnerved her.</p><p>And he realized that he yearned to help.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You want to be with me.\u201d</p><p>She wagged a finger at him. \u201cYour Krewe is coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI think you\u2019ll like them. Logan Raintree heads up my unit. He\u2019s an ex-Ranger like me. He\u2019s now officially engaged to Kelsey O\u2019Brien, who used to be a U.S. Marshal. Kelsey has a cousin on our Krewe, Sean Cameron, who\u2019s a whiz with cameras and special effects. We have Jane Everett, an artist, who can take a spoken description of someone and turn it into something that\u2019s almost an absolute likeness. And...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOur last Krewe member is Kat Sokolov.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an artist? A vocal recognition specialist? A forensics guru?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s...a medical examiner,\u201d Tyler said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill she see Julian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Their meals were put before them and Tyler thanked their server. Allison picked up her fork, pushing her food around.</p> <p>\u201cYou really should eat,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m eating, I\u2019m eating!\u201d she said, spearing a piece of broccoli as if to prove it. She was beginning to sound fine again.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished\u2014consuming everything on her plate\u2014he offered her a few ibuprofen caplets to minimize the headache that seemed to be coming on.</p><p>She took them with a second glass of water and then sipped her third cup of coffee.</p><p>Again, he set a hand on hers. This time, she didn\u2019t pull away. \u201cI can help you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re a decent person, and I appreciate it. But I have to help myself.\u201d She sat straighter, appearing more controlled than she had been, her tone suggesting it was business as usual.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want any of us to help you in any way, just say the word.\u201d</p><p>She smiled\u2014a real smile. A sincere smile. \u201cThank you. I do feel much better. You\u2019ve helped me already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what would you be doing if we weren\u2019t investigating the house? If it was your day off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m not teaching right now, you mean? Research and writing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the house?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAcademics need to publish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re working on the history of the house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot the house itself. Well, in a way. I\u2019m doing a study of the British occupation, and the social and political ramifications. The situation between Lucy Tarleton and Beast Bradley and his relationship with the Tarleton-Dandridge family are an excellent example of the complex political climate at the time. That we won the Revolution was pretty much a miracle, you know. The British had the finest fighting forces, on land and sea. Taking nothing away from George Washington\u2019s abilities\u2014he had no money, deserting troops and he was facing horrendous firepower\u2014we were losing more battles than we were winning. That\u2019s why I admire the founding fathers. Signing that declaration made you a dead man if you were apprehended, but so many signed it, knowing they were up against unbelievable odds. I wonder if I could have done it,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cSo the work you\u2019re doing is on Beast Bradley.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her coffee cup. \u201cI started researching him more or less by accident. The story that we know has been handed down, more oral history and even legend than anything. Oh, the foundations are fact\u2014Beast Bradley did take over the house, the Tarleton family did pretend to be Loyalist during that period and Lucy Tarleton was murdered there. But I couldn\u2019t find anything written about the event that wasn\u2019t secondhand. I realize Lucy couldn\u2019t have told the story herself, but Angus never wrote about it. The first person to put anything on paper was the first Dandridge to own the house\u2014Sophia\u2019s husband, Tobias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere have to be more records somewhere, letters, something,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure there are. They just have to be hunted down. I had figured I\u2019d try to get to a few places where they\u2019ve preserved letters and journals from the period. I\u2019d thought about taking a trip to Valley Forge and maybe one to Saratoga. I was hoping I could find more information, particularly at Valley Forge. I\u2019ve been in touch with an amateur historian there who\u2019s really interested in this period. We know Lucy went from the house to Valley Forge several times during the occupation. She must have been acquainted with a number of the men there. She was being a patriotic angel of mercy and brought through anything she could\u2014shoes, bandages, blankets\u2014things that were desperately needed. Of course, her main mission was to provide information, so what she could sneak through the barricades was limited. She must have been a truly heroic and sympathetic woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very curious about the two paintings,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe paintings in Lucy\u2019s bedroom and in Angus\u2019s study?\u201d Allison asked. \u201cThey are very different. The one in Lucy\u2019s bedroom is rather surprising, but that\u2019s where the Dandridge family had it, and supposedly, it\u2019d been there since the British occupation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think that\u2019s odd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we never really know why people do what they do,\u201d Allison said. \u201cUnless they tell us, and even then...\u201d She started to lift her cup; it clattered as it fell back into the saucer.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tyler asked. She\u2019d seen something behind him. He turned to look.</p><p>There were other diners, nothing more.</p><p>She stared down at the table.</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, then picked up her cup again. Her fingers were long and elegant with silvery polish on the nails. She held her cup firmly, almost tightly enough to snap off the handle. \u201cCan we go now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He gestured at the waiter, then quickly paid the check when it came. He escorted her from the restaurant with his hand on her back. She seemed to want to be touched; again, he wasn\u2019t lacking in self-confidence, but he didn\u2019t think she was dying to be in his arms.</p><p>As they walked, he began to smile. He\u2019d seen it before\u2014he\u2019d been there before, right where she was now.</p><p>Seeing those he should not see.</p><p>Allison was seeing a ghost.</p><p>If he suggested it, she\u2019d deny it. She\u2019d give him psychological explanations.</p><p>But she was afraid.</p><p>\u201cI went to the hospital today,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d She flashed him a guilty look. \u201cI should have gone by. How is Mr. Dixon? How\u2019s Haley\u2014and the boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys weren\u2019t there. Mr. Dixon\u2019s condition is unchanged. Haley seems to be holding up fairly well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do need to see those kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow, maybe. I know they\u2019d appreciate it. But I believe Todd in particular will appreciate that you\u2019re going through the house. He\u2019s convinced you\u2019re the key to making his father better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not!\u201d She looked at him earnestly. \u201cTyler, honestly, how could I help? Even if I were one of those crazy dial-a-psychic people and thought I could have a conversation with every soul who ever spent time in the house, how could that help Mr. Dixon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComa is a complex condition, and it can be brought on by so many things. Kat is our medical specialist, but she\u2019s the first to remind us all that, so far, science has shown that the human brain\u2019s capacity is far greater than we use. There may be scientific answers that coincide with a great deal of what we consider to be paranormal. Maybe just talking to Mr. Dixon will bring him back. I\u2019ve heard of cases where someone\u2019s been in a coma for an unknown reason for years\u2014and then come back. No matter how far we think we\u2019ve gotten in our technological age, there are many things we have yet to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to encourage Todd to believe I can create some kind of miracle for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust assure him that you\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>They reached the Tarleton-Dandridge House and Tyler opened the gate and the door, keying in the alarm. Allison followed closely behind him.</p><p>\u201cSo, shall we go up to the attic?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess we should.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to look toward Angus Tarleton\u2019s study, and he didn\u2019t blame her. The police would be sending a crime scene cleanup crew in the next few days, but at this point her friend\u2019s blood still stained the floor.</p><p>They climbed the stairs to the second story. Tyler had been repeatedly drawn to the painting in Lucy\u2019s room; he saw that Allison lingered just outside in the hallway, studying it.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look so evil here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe looks...contemplative, or thoughtful, almost as if he\u2019s carrying a heavy burden and is sorry for what must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA far kinder artist,\u201d Tyler agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhich image do you think is the real one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine a little of both. We all know that good people can do bad things, and people we consider to be bad can do good things. And every human being is a mixture of virtues and faults.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised when she grinned at him. \u201cYou\u2019re all right, you know.\u201d</p><p>He grinned back. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, you\u2019ve been exceptionally kind when I was pretty argumentative or...or strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMa\u2019am, my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you a cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family might have owned cows at one time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I never had any. I can ride like a demon, though, and I love horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraight shooter?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cMy aim is damned good, if I do say so myself.\u201d</p><p>They continued to the attic. For a moment, they paused in the doorway, examining the wreckage. Then Tyler stepped in, first lifting up the printer and computer and moving papers so they\u2019d have a place to start.</p><p>Allison went down on her knees, trying to gather up the slew of papers that covered the floor. He knelt beside her, collecting other ones and giving them to her to sort. \u201cI think these are some kind of reservation sheets,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey are. If you can look for those, I\u2019ll try to gather the research papers. Oh, and that journal can go back on the desk. It\u2019s petty-cash payouts. Lord! The tiny scraps all over are receipts for cleaning supplies, coffee... Things the employees pick up but that the corporation pays for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get all of that stuff. The research is mostly yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly. But everyone who works here\u2014or worked here,\u201d she added, \u201cloved the history and was interested in it. If my coworkers came across an article or theory regarding the family or the house or even the British in Philly, they made a point of sending me the link or getting me a copy.\u201d</p><p>Tyler found sheets ripped from an educational magazine. The headline read Lord Brian Bradley. True Beast or Passionate Loyalist? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sat down to read the article. It began with the basics: Brian Bradley was from a noble Yorkshire family with ties to the Royal House of Hanover. His service to the British military and the Crown started when he was barely out of his teens. He\u2019d been promoted to the rank of general soon after the beginning of the conflict with the Americans and he\u2019d been ordered to the city of Philadelphia to control the intelligence slipping out\u2014and gain it for the British. Angus Tarleton\u2019s house was considered one of the finest in the city, so it was natural that an important figure in an occupying force should take the mansion. The Tarletons professed their allegiance to the Crown and were allowed to host the general and several members of his retinue. It was likely that the family did resent the fact that the general took over the master chamber; Susannah Tarleton, Angus\u2019s wife, had died in 1774, but Angus was asked to vacate his chamber and move into another room in the house. He was said to have done as requested graciously.</p><p>As he read Tyler realized that Allison had grown quiet. He looked over to see her staring at the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t hear him at first.</p><p>\u201cAllison.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him, startled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She managed a weak smile. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Tyler frowned, but he couldn\u2019t drag anything else out of her. He returned to the article.</p><p>\u201cWhile popular legend had it that \u2018Beast\u2019 Bradley took suspected patriot spies out to the woods and executed them,\u201d he read, \u201cthere is no record or proof of this action. When the British fled the city and victory was at last proclaimed, twenty citizens were charged with treason and two executed, but by the patriots, not the British. While Bradley was required to interrogate prisoners, there is no known record of any of his interrogations causing the death of those questioned, nor does legend name any names. Whether Bradley did or didn\u2019t murder Lucy Tarleton in her own home is up for debate, since the story seems to be part of family lore. Therefore, this researcher finds the popular accepted version of her death suspect. Lucy Tarleton is buried in the family cemetery on the grounds of the Tarleton-Dandridge House and, not surprisingly, has been seen \u2018haunting\u2019 the property.\u201d</p><p>Tyler felt an unnatural stillness around him; he looked up again. Allison was frozen, staring at the entrance, where the stairs from the second floor came up to the attic.</p><p>He looked in the same direction. There was nothing there.</p> <p>He set down his reading, rose and walked over to her, reaching down for her hands, urging her to rise.</p><p>She took his hands, gazing up at him blankly and then with a question in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBreak time. How about a walk outside? I haven\u2019t seen much of the grounds.\u201d</p><p>She stood, her knees wobbly.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cWe can get out for a few minutes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty out there. At one time, of course, there were acres and acres. Now there\u2019s just the kitchen, the stables and the cemetery. The cemetery is nice, and the family vault is beautiful. There are other burials and entombments out there, too, and if family members die, they can still be entombed in one of the above- or belowground vaults. The specs for it are held at the offices of Old Philly History.\u201d</p><p>She seemed to need to speak; she was going on and on about the property. He set a finger against her lips, looking down into her eyes. \u201cWhat is it you\u2019re seeing?\u201d</p><p>He thought he heard something. A man\u2019s whisper.</p><p>\u201cTell him. Just tell him!\u201d</p> <p>Allison groaned.</p><p>\u201cAllison, you see someone. I can hear him. Who is it?\u201d</p><p>She looked beyond him, to the doorway. Her words were anguished as she spoke to the person Tyler had yet to see. \u201cStop it! Stop it, please stop it, Julian. You\u2019re a figment of my imagination, not his.\u201d</p><p>Tyler turned to the doorframe. Slowly, he began to see the figure of a young man. Julian Mitchell had been good-looking with a cocky flair to his appearance. He leaned into the room casually but in life, Tyler thought with some amusement, he\u2019d probably practiced his stance in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cAllison, come on. I can\u2019t do much about who does or doesn\u2019t see me. I tried knocking the hat off a nasty old lady who was giving a waitress grief at that restaurant tonight and it didn\u2019t work\u2014although I did give her a bit of a chill. But I know you see me clearly, that you hear every word I say,\u201d the ghost told her.</p><p>\u201cYes, don\u2019t you get it? I see you. I\u2019m feeling guilty\u2014though I have no idea why! I covered for your sorry ass a dozen times, and I always tried to show up when you had a performance. We were good friends, Julian, you know we were!\u201d Allison said. Then she clapped a hand over her mouth and turned to face Tyler.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. I went to a shrink this morning, and he told me I\u2019m creating Julian in my mind. Because I think I should have saved him, or that I might have been a better friend, or...I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s like a plague! He won\u2019t go away. He was at my house, then he was here, then he was at Independence Hall.... He\u2019s everywhere! I can\u2019t get away from him.\u201d</p><p>She was so distressed, so fragile and, seemingly, so broken. Tyler pulled her into his arms and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s really all right.\u201d</p><p>He spoke to the young man standing in the doorway. \u201cSurely, there\u2019s a better way to do this! Allison was a good friend to you, and now you\u2019re doing this to her?\u201d</p><p>Julian Mitchell\u2019s ghost had the grace to look apologetic.</p><p>\u201cI have to, don\u2019t you see? I have to, because I don\u2019t know what happened, and I\u2019m walking in this new world\u2014this world of death!\u2014alone. But I didn\u2019t kill myself, and it wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>He left the doorframe and walked toward them.</p><p>\u201cI need help!\u201d he said, an edge of desperation in his voice.</p><p>Allison frowned at Tyler. \u201cYou see him? You don\u2019t have to humor me!\u201d</p><p>Tyler smiled and stroked her cheek. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want us here because you said we were ghost busters. You thought we were all about sensationalism and cheap thrills. That\u2019s not it, Allison. We try to help the living\u2014and the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have to help me,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho did it?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you have to find out!\u201d Julian Mitchell shook his head irritably. He sank down to the floor in his period dress. \u201cI don\u2019t know who or how\u2014all I know is that it has something to do with that god-awful painting of Beast Bradley in Angus Tarleton\u2019s study.\u201d</p><p>8</p><p>Allison wasn\u2019t sure whether or not she felt reassured. According to Tyler, she wasn\u2019t going crazy....</p><p>But now it seemed that on the day Julian Mitchell died, she\u2019d stepped out of anything resembling a normal life\u2014and straight into an episode of that old TV show The Twilight Zone.</p><p>In the few beats of silence following Julian\u2019s dramatic statement, they were all startled by the loud and strident ring of Tyler\u2019s phone.</p><p>He fumbled in his pocket and found his cell. \u201cMontague!...Yes, yes, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d He clicked off the phone.</p><p>\u201cThe Krewe members are here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to run down and open the gate and let them into the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKrewe members?\u201d To Allison\u2019s astonishment, Julian began to vanish into thin air.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re like us, Julian,\u201d Tyler said quickly. \u201cThey know. They see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Julian asked, his image fading in and out.</p><p>\u201cI have to go let them in,\u201d Tyler said again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming with you!\u201d Allison told him, staring wide-eyed at the place where Julian seemed solid and then not, there and then not.</p><p>\u201cAlly!\u201d Julian said, using her nickname in a broken plea. \u201cAlly, I don\u2019t want to hurt you. I just want help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all go down,\u201d Tyler said with an exasperated sigh. \u201cMight as well make the introductions\u2014all of them.\u201d</p><p>He headed for the door; Allison started to follow and then stopped for a minute. Julian was suddenly the same man he\u2019d always been to her. A little brother, someone with whom she was often frustrated and still cared about a great deal. He was in costume, a performer as always, in death as in life. Selfish\u2014he just was!\u2014but not cruel or evil or even aware of the trouble or aggravation he caused others.</p><p>He\u2019d come to her for help a thousand times in life.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t so unusual, perhaps, that he had done so now.</p><p>\u201cJulian, come on, let\u2019s meet the others. From what I understand, these are the people who can help you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and seemed solid again. He nodded. They might both have found courage at the same time.</p><p>Tyler had gone down the stairs. With renewed composure, Allison followed him. Julian, she felt certain, was behind her. She could feel him.</p><p>Allison waited in the grand entry while Tyler went through the mudroom, leaving the front door ajar while he hurried out to open the gate. She heard easy conversation and the sound of luggage and bags scraping on the brick walkway and then Tyler\u2019s team started to come in. The first through the doorway was Tyler; next was a tall, striking dark-haired man of mixed Native American and European descent, then a tall blonde woman, a tiny blonde woman, a slender dark-haired woman with a stunning face and another tall man with sandy hair and light eyes. Tyler began the introductions: Logan Raintree, their team head, was accompanied by the tall blonde, Kelsey O\u2019Brien, once a U.S. Marshal. The tiny blonde was Kat Sokolov, medical pathologist, the tall man with the light eyes was Sean Cameron, computer and camera expert, and the pretty brunette was Jane Everett, forensic artist.</p><p>Allison shook hands with all and greeted them. They seemed very normal. The introductions were so pleasant she might have been meeting them at a casual party. She thought they were a group she would have enjoyed meeting at a party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSean, the big case is the camera equipment?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I figured we\u2019d put the computers and the screens somewhere central, like here in this hallway. I can set up the cameras in whichever rooms you want,\u201d Sean told him.</p><p>\u201cHave you discovered anything? Can you bring us up to speed?\u201d Logan asked.</p> <p>\u201cWait, wait, please!\u201d Kelsey O\u2019Brien held up one hand. \u201cMs. Leigh, can you show me the restroom? It\u2019s been a long drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese guys don\u2019t like to stop once they\u2019re on the road,\u201d Jane Everett said.</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve stopped!\u201d Logan protested.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019d actually noticed that one of us was speaking.\u201d Kat smiled at Allison. \u201cLogan gets into think-mode the minute we\u2019re on our way anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA public restroom was put in right there, beneath the stairs,\u201d Allison said, directing Kelsey. \u201cThere\u2019s also a small restroom in the break area\u2014used to be a pantry\u2014and there\u2019s a shower stall in there, too. That\u2019s it\u2014oh, except for another small restroom out by the stables. We only have the one shower. But, of course, any of you are welcome to spend time at my house for a longer shower or a better night\u2019s sleep, if necessary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, Ms. Leigh,\u201d Logan said. He looked at Tyler, slowly arching a brow. \u201cThere\u2019s one introduction you haven\u2019t made. Is Ms. Leigh aware...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf Julian Mitchell?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cJulian, I\u2019m pretty sure you just heard all the intros. Want to become a little more visible?\u201d</p><p>To Allison\u2019s amazement, she heard Julian\u2019s voice, almost like a distorted echo\u2014and almost shy.</p><p>Julian! Suddenly shy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that good at this yet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, um, yes, how do you do? And welcome to the Tarleton-Dandridge House.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Logan murmured, and the others did the same.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been perfectly good at showing yourself to me and scaring me out of my wits and sanity,\u201d Allison said. \u201cPlease,\u201d she told the others, \u201cdon\u2019t get the impression that Julian is any kind of shrinking violet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlly!\u201d Julian said. His form began to appear.</p><p>\u201cYou were killed here, Julian?\u201d Logan asked quietly, glancing at Tyler.</p><p>\u201cJulian and I met just before you arrived,\u201d Tyler explained.</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cFive-minute bathroom break,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone back in here, and we\u2019ll talk to Julian and get set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the one benefit!\u201d Julian now appeared fully before them all, still in his Colonial splendor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Sean Cameron asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a bathroom break anymore.\u201d Julian tried to say the words jokingly. It didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>There was such sadness in his voice that they were all silent. Tyler stood close to him, setting a hand lightly in the air where Julian\u2019s shoulder seemed to be. It was evident to Allison that Tyler had known the dead before. His movement was in no way awkward; his hand didn\u2019t sit there lamely, but really seemed to touch the spirit of the dead man. \u201cThe human body is fragile, Julian. And with it comes frailty and pain. The soul is on a higher plane and yet it can still feel the torture of grief and loss, but there\u2019s a place of peace and beauty, too. We\u2019ve learned that, we\u2019ve seen it. And we\u2019ll get you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, yes,\u201d Julian said softly. Then he grinned and stepped back as if embarrassed by his weakness. \u201cBathroom break! Then I\u2019ll tell you what I know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who did this?\u201d Kelsey asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014no. I heard a voice and I saw\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw what?\u201d Tyler broke in.</p><p>\u201cThe painting. It was Beast Bradley. I saw him come alive in the painting, and I heard him speak to me.\u201d</p><p>Paintings don\u2019t speak! Allison longed to cry.</p><p>But she remained silent.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s time for you to die, boy. It\u2019s time for you to die.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tyler\u2019s team was efficient. After Julian spoke, they moved about, Kelsey running for the restroom, Sean opening equipment and Tyler himself directing the others so they could rearrange the foyer in a way that would allow them to gather there. He thought Allison seemed tense as they shifted things around; Logan noticed and assured her that they were being very careful.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to solve the death of a dear friend and I\u2019m worried about historical preservation. I am crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe respect that,\u201d Logan said with a glimmer of a smile.</p><p>Allison, Tyler was glad to see, had relaxed. She\u2019d accepted the fact that she did see Julian\u2014and that others saw him, too.</p><p>That was kind of a pity, he mused. It was nice when she\u2019d seemed to need him for strength. Now, she had her self back. She was confident again. Maybe this was the best scenario; she\u2019d lost the hostility she\u2019d had toward him and his crew. She was part of the investigation now, and that was good. They needed her.</p><p>Still, it was really nice when she\u2019d clung to him!</p><p>He shook off the thought. Sean had nearly completed their setup of a video monitoring system. And a place where they could all talk had now been arranged. The sofa Allison had slept on was part of the circle, along with a few of the chairs brought in from the dining room and a big wingback that stood near the stairway. Julian Mitchell had chosen that chair. He was either being courteous or playing his part as a colonist; he waited until the women were seated to take his own chair.</p><p>Logan nodded toward Tyler, since he was the lead investigator here.</p><p>\u201cJulian, what exactly happened? I went to check out the painting. It\u2019s a strange portrait, done by Tobias Dandridge. He must have been an accomplished artist, and he also hated Beast Bradley, that\u2019s for certain. But I didn\u2019t find anything about the painting that would make you think it was alive or that it had moved,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, the eyes were looking at me. Of course, the way the damned thing is painted, it always seems to be looking at you. But that afternoon when I sat down, it was...more than that. He was staring at me. And then I heard him speaking,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell had you been all day?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>He shrugged apologetically. \u201cOkay, so there was an audition to open for a major concert coming to Philadelphia. They wanted a local band, and we\u2019d made it past the first auditions. I didn\u2019t know until that morning, I swear!\u201d he told Allison. \u201cSo I snuck out after lunch. I came back in at the tail end of your last tour, and while you were with one of the kids, I went up to the attic to wait until it was over. I heard everyone leaving and I knew you were locking up, so I slipped down to Angus\u2019s study to talk to you and apologize and suck up. If I could get you to forgive me, the others would, too.\u201d</p><p>Tyler saw that Julian gazed at Allison with yearning and hope, praying she\u2019d forgive him, even now. Apparently, she was always the \u201cnice guy,\u201d the one the others turned to, the responsible one.</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s forgiven you every single time, Julian,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThis time, of course...well, everyone wants to tell you how sorry they are.\u201d</p><p>Julian let out a little sound that was like a sob.</p><p>Allison reached over to touch him, but she wasn\u2019t accustomed to ghosts and her hand fell\u2014heavily\u2014through the air. She flushed and said, \u201cWe do love you, Julian, no matter what. And remember, none of us is meant to stay on this earth forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat then, Julian?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cI was sitting back in old Angus\u2019s chair, just waiting, and I saw something in the painting. The eyes were alive, and then the painting spoke.... That was when I felt my chin go over the bayonet and I felt this raw agony. My head felt like it had been hit by a hammer. I remember trying to scream but it was impossible. I was cold and then I realized that I was staring at myself and that I wasn\u2019t actually in myself anymore... The room was silent and I looked at the blood on the floor and I knew it was mine. Then everything went black.\u201d He paused for a minute, inhaling on a deep breath. \u201cI heard Ally scream. And I watched as she sank against the door. Then she fumbled in her pockets for her phone and called 9-1-1 and just sat there, crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone else?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cAfter your chin fell on the bayonet and you started bleeding to dea\u2014\u201d He stopped abruptly. \u201cWas there anyone else in the room with you?\u201d</p><p>Julian was thoughtful. \u201cBleeding to death. I\u2019m dead. No way out of it. No, I didn\u2019t see anyone. It was as if I couldn\u2019t look away from the painting.\u201d He frowned. \u201cWait! I think\u2014I could be wrong\u2014I think I sensed some kind of movement. Someone...skirting around the desk to the door into the music room. There was someone with me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea who it was?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>Julian nodded. \u201cWell, I guess it had to be Beast Bradley, right? I was looking at his picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPictures don\u2019t kill,\u201d Allison insisted.</p><p>\u201cNor do the spirits of those who haunt a house,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThey can create ill will, they can make a place uncomfortable, but they can\u2019t come out of a painting and force your head down on a bayonet. Not that I know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn our experience,\u201d Logan explained to Julian, \u201cit\u2019s human beings using ghost stories who do the killing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was something about that painting,\u201d Julian said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the painting,\u201d Allison suggested.</p><p>Tyler looked at her, surprised that she was going to condone taking down a historic piece of art.</p><p>Then again, sitting next to a ghost could change a person\u2019s mind on what was the right thing to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get it,\u201d Sean said. \u201cCarefully,\u201d he added, smiling at Allison. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He disappeared into Angus Tarleton\u2019s study and quickly reappeared, holding the painting gingerly. He set it against the sofa and hunkered down to look at it.</p><p>\u201cGood piece,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing unusual about the painting, is there?\u201d Tyler asked. He stood beside Sean, studying the work. He knew he was the best shot in their crowd, that he could bail them out in a melee and that, thanks to his college years, he also comprehended a fair amount of science and the preservation of evidence.</p> <p>But Sean was their expert on visual tricks, film and computers.</p><p>Sean shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s excellently done. The artist was a master at capturing expression and especially at painting eyes. But...it\u2019s a painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, it moved\u2014and it talked,\u201d Julian said. \u201cOr Beast Bradley did.\u201d He turned to Allison. \u201cI\u2019m irresponsible and I\u2019ve been an idiot lots of times, but you know I don\u2019t lie or make things up. The man in this painting moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould the painting have been switched?\u201d Tyler mused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d Allison said. \u201cThe board was here most of the day. They left when I was doing the last tour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I was back in the house when they were leaving,\u201d Julian said. He laughed dryly. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have my musket and bayonet when I listened to them leave. I went to the closet to get it. I wanted to be in full character when I tried to cajole you into forgiving me,\u201d he told Allison. \u201cI thought you\u2019d find that charming,\u201d he said sheepishly. \u201cOr proof of my sincerity. Or...something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, so the board was here\u2014the four of them\u2014in the attic office. They left. You were on the second level?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cI was on the second level, yes, dodging between the two tours. I followed Jason\u2019s tour into the house and went upstairs while he was in the grand salon. I was in Lucy Tarleton\u2019s bedroom while I waited for the board members to go downstairs. After that I was up in the attic for a while. By the way, that\u2019s great stuff you\u2019re doing on Lucy and her movements during the war, Allison. Anyhow, when the last tour went out and Jason and Allison were over in the pantry area behind the dining room, I snuck into Angus Tarleton\u2019s study.\u201d He paused, eyes widening. \u201cWeird! I felt like someone had gone up to the attic after me, kind of like I was being followed.\u201d</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any secret panels, hidden rooms or anything like that here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was running around the house with a couple of dozen people in it, and you didn\u2019t find me,\u201d Julian reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Allison murmured. Then she looked up at them and said, \u201cThere is one other way to get from the ground floor to the second\u2014through a servants\u2019 stairway beyond a door in the pantry. I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s ever taken it or not. We never used it. You can only access it through the pantry, which is our employee area, and guests aren\u2019t allowed in there. The door on the second floor opens just beside the master bedroom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShall we take a look?\u201d Tyler suggested.</p><p>\u201cWe can do that now,\u201d Logan said, glancing at his watch. \u201cThen we should finish unloading and setting up, have something to eat and let Allison go home and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>They rose, but Julian sat stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to let this slide, are you? Decide that I was stoned or something and tell everyone it was an accident? I was murdered. I\u2019m not lying. My head was pushed down on that bayonet. It happened while I was staring at the painting. I was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a long way to go here,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cWere you stoned?\u201d Kat asked him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m a medical examiner, and I\u2019ll be checking out your autopsy report tomorrow. And your remains.\u201d</p><p>Julian stood, looking at Kat. \u201cI had a few tokes of pot. Hey, I was at an audition! I wasn\u2019t drinking or anything.\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re an M.E.?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>Julian shrugged. \u201cWell, I guess if someone\u2019s going to be playing around with my body, I won\u2019t mind so much if it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian!\u201d Allison chastised. She turned back to the others. \u201cI\u2019ll show you the back stairway.\u201d</p><p>She told them that once a week a cleaning crew came in\u2014a carefully selected cleaning crew\u2014to dust the fragile historic pieces.</p><p>But when they followed her through the pantry, which was a tight squeeze with the seven of them and the spiritual remains of Julian Mitchell, they discovered that the servants\u2019 stairway was extremely dusty.</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t been in here for a while,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go one at a time. It\u2019s narrow and has a sharp angle.\u201d</p><p>Tyler brought up the rear as they climbed up. The servants\u2019 stairway led to a very small landing by a door, which opened into the hallway next to the master bedroom.</p><p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been disturbed,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWell, we\u2019re on the second floor. We might as well decide on bedrooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in the master,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get my stuff out. There\u2019s more room in there for you and Kelsey. In fact, if no one has a problem with it, I\u2019ll move into Lucy\u2019s room.\u201d</p><p>Allison seemed tense as she watched them choose their rooms. Sean said he thought maybe he\u2019d just take his sleeping bag up to the attic. Jane and Kat opted to stay together in Sophia Tarleton-Dandridge\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s scared.\u201d Julian was standing behind Allison as if protecting her in a brotherly fashion.</p><p>\u201cI was scared of you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be alone,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I just told you\u2014you were the one scaring me. Now that I know you\u2019re real\u2014well, not real, but real in terms of being a ghost\u2014I\u2019m not scared anymore.\u201d</p><p>Julian placed his hands on her shoulders. Tyler saw her jump slightly, feeling the strange physical sensation of being \u201ctouched\u201d by a ghost. \u201cThey\u2019ll let you stay here. There are two bedrooms left on this floor. Allison, whoever killed me might be after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone be after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would anyone have killed me?\u201d Julian demanded. \u201cWell, sure, you probably all said at one time or another that you wanted to kill me, but you didn\u2019t mean it. Think about it, Ally\u2014why would anyone kill me? It wasn\u2019t my voice or my guitar playing, I swear!\u201d</p><p>Tyler was glad to see her smile at that.</p><p>\u201cThis is a historic property, Julian. In two of the bedrooms, the mattresses can\u2019t even be used. They\u2019re kept so visitors can see what the rope beds were like and how people had to tighten the ropes now and then. The mattresses on them are made of straw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe carry bedrolls wherever we go,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAre the ropes on the beds original?\u201d</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cNo, they\u2019ve been replaced dozens of times through the decades\u2014centuries. The rooms themselves went through a number of changes over the years, but when the house became the property of Old Philly History, the decor was brought back to what it had been during the Colonial era. The bed frames are original, but nothing else. Except that some of the quilts are from the eighteenth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll carefully fold up the quilts,\u201d Kat promised her.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one dingy little shower down in the pantry,\u201d Allison said. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here. I don\u2019t want to take room away from all of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour life\u2014or a shower?\u201d Julian muttered.</p><p>\u201cHey, may I remind you that you were killed here?\u201d Allison said to him.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be alone,\u201d Julian repeated stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Tyler added, \u201chere\u2019s what we know so far. Julian was up in the attic reading research papers. He felt that someone was watching him. He came downstairs. The attic\u2014where he\u2019d just been\u2014was trashed. And when he went into the study, he was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Leigh,\u201d Logan said, joining the group, \u201cor Allison if I may call you that. I don\u2019t have the authority to tell you what to do. But if Julian was killed because of something he knew about this house, or something another person believed he knew, you might be in danger, as well. It would be smart to stay in a house with six trained agents.\u201d</p><p>Allison looked helplessly from one to the other.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anywhere else you have to be,\u201d Julian said. \u201cYou could sit right here and work on your paper with all your precious Tarleton-Dandridge pieces surrounding you. And be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s going to be helping us, Allison,\u201d Kat pointed out. \u201cIt would be wonderful to have you here.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Tyler didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be persuaded.</p><p>\u201cBetter safe than dead, and trust me, I know,\u201d Julian said. \u201cPlease, Ally. I was a jerk to you, and you were my friend. Let me be your friend now. Please, do what I say?\u201d</p><p>She threw up her hands. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk Allison over to her place so she can pack a bag,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><p>It was easier to accept the strange invitation from the Krewe than Allison had expected.</p><p>That was because she was scared.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to be scared; she wanted to be a rational and independent adult. She liked her home. It had been her home all her life. She\u2019d been excited to leave for college, but when her parents had talked about selling their house, she knew she wanted it. And they hadn\u2019t really wanted to sell, so her slowly buying the house from them had made sense. She loved living there.</p><p>She told herself that she was going to be staying just down the street...and just for a little while. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was unnerving that someone might want to kill her.

He only knows now what he knew when he was living,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m asking you about ghosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one does,\u201d he said lightly.</p><p>\u201cDo you always see ghosts? When you\u2019re in the historic district, say, do you see our founding fathers walking around the Liberty Bell?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cA ghost can only be in one place at one time, and not all souls stay grounded to this earth. Of those who do stay, some are here to help others and some for justice. Some appear to many people, and some just to a certain few. Some remain shadowy figures for the time they stay\u2014too shy or locked in their own worlds to make contact with anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf there were other ghosts in this house, would Julian see them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they chose to be seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think there are other...entities at the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cAnd if there are...could they move around, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost likely.\u201d</p> <p>She felt another shiver rip through her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do this,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t really choose it. It chose me. I could have decided to become a roaring alcoholic\u2014which did occur to me at the time\u2014or accept that I was seeing things and hearing things that others didn\u2019t.\u201d He paused, reflective. \u201cBut I worked with Logan, and we eventually realized that we shared certain...abilities? And we were thrown into working with Kat often enough, and Jane\u2014and even Sean. That\u2019s when we were in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Kelsey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelsey was a U.S. Marshal, as you know, and she was transferred to Texas specifically to meet Jackson Crow, the head of the first unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s\u2014wow, this is nosy. She\u2019s with Logan now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re engaged. They\u2019re just waiting for a break between cases to tie the knot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! They met on a case?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJulian might still have imagined what happened,\u201d Allison said, returning to the previous subject.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>She nearly jumped a mile high when the voice came from behind them.</p><p>She swung around. She could see Julian walking a few feet to her side.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what? You know I\u2019m here,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to follow me like a shadow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian, I\u2019m with a federal agent. He carries a gun. He\u2019s a big Texan. You should be at the house in case they need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here now. And it shouldn\u2019t take you long to get a few things together.\u201d</p><p>Allison sighed with aggravation.</p><p>Tyler grinned. \u201cI can\u2019t beat him up and tell him not to hang around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not intruding!\u201d Julian protested. \u201cI don\u2019t follow people into the shower or anything. Hmm, that\u2019s a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian!\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding. I was a jerk, not a peeping Tom!\u201d</p><p>When they reached her house, Allison left Julian and Tyler in her parlor and hurried up the stairs to pack her bag. Luckily, it was a short walk between her house and the Tarleton-Dandridge. It would be easy to come back and forth for what she needed or wanted\u2014like a long hot bath now and then. Of course, Julian had been teasing, but she found it uncomfortable to think that a ghost could follow her anywhere she went.</p><p>She glanced in the bathroom mirror. Her eyes were way too wide. She looked like a cartoon character who\u2019d stuck her finger in an electrical outlet.</p><p>Because she saw a ghost.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think about it; she didn\u2019t dare think about it. She had to hold on to Tyler\u2019s words. I could have decided to become a roaring alcoholic...or accept that I was seeing things and hearing things that others didn\u2019t.</p><p>She could just imagine explaining this situation to some of her academic colleagues!</p><p>She understood why the Krewe kept quiet about what they did and why information about them could only be surmised by reading between the lines.</p><p>She thought about Adam Harrison, and how kindly and sane he had always seemed.</p><p>He was sane. He just knew what other people didn\u2019t, that a lot lay beneath the surface of their daily lives, that the soul did exist and, sometimes, it lingered.</p><p>Allison gathered what she needed for a night or two, and hurried down the stairs.</p><p>Tyler stared up at her as she descended. Julian stood behind him, his tension unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you decided to stay with us,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Julian stepped forward. \u201cMrs. Dixon\u2014Todd\u2019s mother\u2014called Tyler from the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Mr. Dixon come to?\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide her anxiety.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cThank God\u2014he\u2019s out of the coma!\u201d</p><p>But Tyler shook his head grimly. \u201cNo, he fell back into it. He came to for about twenty seconds, sat up in bed and spoke one word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAllison,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said,\u201d Tyler told her quietly. \u201cHe said one word. Allison. He said your name.\u201d</p><p>9</p><p>Tyler watched as Allison sat by Artie Dixon\u2019s bedside. Unnerved, she\u2019d been convinced that Haley Dixon had misheard what her husband said. Allison could have been a reason or any other combination of words.</p><p>But he\u2019d noted right away that she cared about Todd and Todd\u2019s family, and because Haley had asked that Allison come to the hospital, she had. Now she sat on the bed, holding Artie\u2019s hand and talking to him. She kept telling him she was fine and he didn\u2019t need to worry about her. He needed to wake up and be with his sons, who loved him and were worried sick, and his wife, who adored him. Bad things had happened, she said, but a wonderful federal unit had arrived to sort everything out.</p><p>The ghost of Julian Mitchell had accompanied them at first. He and Tyler had stood outside the room, watching through the glass. After a few minutes, Julian had looked at Tyler with a pained expression. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here. I\u2019m going to take a walk back to the house. Maybe if I just keep hanging around there, I\u2019ll see something the living can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tyler had merely inclined his head. Todd was with them, and he didn\u2019t think the boy needed to wonder what invisible being Tyler was communicating with.</p><p>Tyler and Todd continued to wait and watch. Tyler rested his hands gently on Todd\u2019s shoulders. Meanwhile, Logan and Kelsey were with Haley Dixon, going over everything that had happened when they\u2019d taken the tour at the Tarleton-Dandridge House and later that night in the hotel room. Kat was reading to Jimmy Dixon and coaxing him to tell her what he could remember about that day, and Sean was searching for Dixon\u2019s doctor.</p><p>Tyler doubted they\u2019d learn anything new, but sometimes, one tiny bit of information could make all the difference.</p><p>\u201cHis hand moved!\u201d Todd said suddenly. He gazed up at Tyler, eyes huge. \u201cI saw it! My dad\u2019s hand moved. He squeezed Allison\u2019s hand\u2014I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he did, Todd,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens now.\u201d</p><p>They waited longer. He could hear Allison\u2019s voice, filled with warmth and reassurance. She wasn\u2019t going to give up easily.</p><p>But eventually, Sean found Dixon\u2019s doctor, who walked past them and into the room. Allison rose, squeezing Dixon\u2019s hand, telling him she\u2019d be back.</p><p>When she joined them in the hall, Todd nearly jumped on her, he was so anxious. \u201cMy dad moved, didn\u2019t he? I know he heard you. I saw his hand move.\u201d</p><p>The doctor had followed Allison out. \u201cThat might just have been a physical reaction. It doesn\u2019t mean she reached his mind. It doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t. But don\u2019t be discouraged, Todd. Your father\u2019s vital signs are strong and the scans reveal he hasn\u2019t suffered any kind of permanent brain damage.\u201d The doctor turned to Allison. \u201cThank you for coming in and trying to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear Mr. Dixon when he spoke?\u201d Tyler asked the doctor.</p><p>\u201cNo, but Clare\u2014the nurse who was with Mr. and Mrs. Dixon when he spoke\u2014is still on duty. I\u2019ll call her for you.\u201d He smiled at them and departed down the hall.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so shaken,\u201d Sean said to Allison. \u201cIt could be a perfectly logical thing. You were one of the last people he saw before he lost consciousness, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish I could help,\u201d Allison mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t with my dad. I was with my aunt, getting chips from the machine,\u201d Todd said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. He spoke and I wasn\u2019t there!\u201d Todd felt the anguish of a child who blamed himself for choosing something insignificant over being with his father.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret about that, Todd,\u201d Allison said, smoothing the boy\u2019s hair. \u201cYour dad knows how much you love him, and we all believe he\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why doesn\u2019t he wake up?\u201d Todd asked.</p><p>They were spared from having to answer when a young platinum-blonde nurse came walking over to them. She nodded at the group and told Todd, \u201cIt\u2019s a good sign, you know. I heard your dad speak plain as day. It\u2019s a really good sign!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She offered her hand to Allison and Tyler. \u201cI\u2019m Clare. I was with Mrs. Dixon when Mr. Dixon sat up and said \u2018Allison.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you just answered the question we had for you,\u201d Tyler said, introducing himself and Allison in return.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he said the word malice,\u201d Allison said hopefully. \u201cOr something like talk to me, son?\u201d</p> <p>Clare shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d She smiled sympathetically. \u201cI guess he\u2019s worried about you, Allison. Wherever his mind might be right now, he\u2019s worried about you. I\u2019m glad you came in to see him. We\u2019ve learned through our experience with other coma patients that they do remember things they heard or that happened before they were in that state. And there\u2019s evidence that they can understand what\u2019s said to them.\u201d</p><p>When she left them, Todd looked at Allison. \u201cYou\u2019ll keep coming to see my dad, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>It was late when they got back to the Tarleton-Dandridge House. Allison seemed exhausted and distracted. Kelsey, Kat and Jane chatted with her, trying to make her feel more normal, as they made tea and then went up to bed.</p><p>The entire crew was worn out, but Tyler spoke to Logan and Sean down in the entry. Sean had finished setting up the computer to record anything caught on the cameras he\u2019d placed throughout the house.</p> <p>\u201cDid Haley Dixon say anything I might not have heard already?\u201d Tyler asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cShe was upset about the painting. She said that Todd felt there was something funny about it, and his father said it was the weirdest damned thing he\u2019d ever seen. He felt the painting was somehow alive\u2014like a special-effects painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at the damned thing. It\u2019s a painting, believe me. I\u2019d know if there was anything that\u2019d been altered on it,\u201d Sean insisted.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s give it up for now and get some sleep,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cGood plan,\u201d Sean agreed.</p><p>They went up to their rooms. Tyler had just crawled into bed when he felt a weight shift the rope beneath the mattress and his bedroll. Tyler still didn\u2019t know all the \u201crules\u201d that went with being a ghost, but he did know that they could learn to move things and that they could be felt if not really touched. Maybe they could tell when someone tried to touch them with warmth and good intentions.</p> <p>Julian was perched at the foot of the bed. Tyler almost groaned aloud; it had been a long day.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Tyler responded tiredly.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going a little crazy,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>Crazy? You\u2019re dead.</p><p>Tyler refrained from saying the words.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t pinpoint it, and I\u2019ve been through the house and the grounds since. But when I got back here, I had the feeling that someone had just left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d all just left. We went to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Julian shook his head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I mean. We\u2019d already been gone a while. There was some...I don\u2019t know, residual energy? Something that made me feel convinced that someone had been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see anyone?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cSee a car leave? Anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I was walking along feeling sorry for myself, trying to sidle up next to people I passed on the street. I think I gave a few of them chills,\u201d he said, chortling to himself.</p><p>Tyler rolled his eyes. Most personalities didn\u2019t change when they became ghosts. Julian was the same prankster he\u2019d been in life.</p><p>He rued the fact that Sean hadn\u2019t set the cameras to record until they\u2019d returned.</p><p>However, the call about Dixon had come quickly. Sean hadn\u2019t actually had a chance to ensure that they were set up for the night or to see what went on in the house when they were sleeping.</p><p>\u201cThe board members still have keys,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe can ask. Maybe one of them came by for some specific purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to get those keys from them,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>Tyler shrugged. \u201cWe can get the keys, but if any of them are guilty of something, they\u2019ve had plenty of chances to make copies. I think we should just set up our alarm system to see if someone with a key does come and go. Sean will take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Julian started to rise as if Tyler would automatically join him.</p><p>\u201cIn the morning,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI really don\u2019t expect anyone to come into a house filled with agents. Whoever it was knew we were going out this evening\u2014although I have no idea how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning,\u201d Julian repeated. \u201cFor now, I\u2019m going to go down and be the alarm system. I\u2019ll be on the sofa in the entry.\u201d</p><p>He left. Tyler prayed for sleep.</p><p>But an hour later, he still lay awake in Lucy Tarleton\u2019s room, staring at the painting of Lord Brian \u201cBeast\u201d Bradley. He looked so different from the Brit envisioned in the painting below.</p><p>There had been other instances, probably in every war, when men on one side or the other had carried out covert executions. During the Revolutionary War Nathan Hale had been executed by the British. John Andr\u00e9 had been executed by the patriots for convincing Benedict Arnold to sell out. But for the most part, murder during conflict was not the norm, unless war itself was considered the greatest form of murder.</p><p>The story associated with the house was almost a fairy tale, a very romantic one about love and the price paid for love. It had a dashing heroine, Lucy Tarleton, and a patriot hero, Stewart Douglas, Lucy\u2019s true love, and it had an ogre, as well\u2014Beast Bradley.</p><p>But the man depicted in the painting in Lucy Tarleton\u2019s bedroom did not seem capable of the vicious and cold-blooded murder of a young woman in her own home.</p><p>Tyler rolled over.</p><p>Even with his bedroll over the straw mattress, he wasn\u2019t very comfortable. That didn\u2019t really bother him; he\u2019d spent many a night on the cold ground in Texas. What bothered him was the case.</p><p>First, was there a case?</p><p>Allison could have a reasonable theory\u2014that Julian Mitchell had imagined he was being followed. He\u2019d imagined the painting doing terrible things to him and had set his own chin on the bayonet and died.</p><p>Except that the attic office had been trashed. And Julian claimed he\u2019d been murdered.</p><p>Tyler rolled over again and punched his pillow, still troubled by the fact that Julian suspected Allison could be in danger.</p><p>And Artie Dixon had come out of his coma long enough to say her name.</p><p>She had to know something. She didn\u2019t know she knew it, but that was the only reason someone might search the office in the attic and kill a man who\u2019d just been up there.</p><p>Still, the painting in the study... Sean had inspected it. There were no trick lights or cut-out eyes. It was a painting, nothing more or less.</p><p>He was glad Allison was sleeping directly across the hall. She\u2019d chosen one of the family guest rooms, and to the best of his knowledge, nothing had ever happened there.</p><p>With a groan, he rose and threw on his robe. He was worried about her. He had Julian to thank for that\u2014Julian, and the man in the hospital who\u2019d woken just long enough to say her name.</p><p>The house was quiet. He could hear the old grandfather clock below in the entry clanging out the hour. Two o\u2019clock.</p><p>Tyler walked across the hall. Allison\u2019s door was ajar. He tapped lightly, but she didn\u2019t answer. He opened the door farther and saw that she lay there, sleeping peacefully.</p><p>He left her door ajar and started to walk back to his own room but paused. He had a sudden feeling that something about the house wasn\u2019t quite right.</p><p>He walked to the stairway and heard another door creak. He turned silently, but it was Logan, who\u2019d come out of his room. He joined Tyler at the landing, looking down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear anything?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>Tyler shook his head. \u201cI think I\u2019m just restless. Worried. Maybe our ghost does have me concerned that someone\u2019s out to hide something and may think that Allison has knowledge regarding whatever it is. Did you hear anything?\u201d</p><p>Logan, too, shook his head. \u201cNo, but I was awake. I had the same feeling. That strange something is moving in the darkness feeling. Want to check out the first floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess I do,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>They walked down the stairs together. There was a greenish glow from the computer with the different screens Sean had set up. They studied them, but there was nothing to be seen. The ghost of Julian Mitchell was sound asleep on the sofa. Julian didn\u2019t rise or acknowledge him. Tyler smiled inwardly. So much for Julian as a watchdog.</p><p>Logan checked the front door and the alarm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the salon, dining room and pantry. Can you look into the study, the ladies\u2019 room and the music room?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cMeet you in the back.\u201d</p><p>He went into the study first; night-lights glowing softly in the corridors led the way.</p><p>He saw nothing there, but in the shadows, the painting of Lord Brian \u201cBeast\u201d Bradley seemed more cruel and cunning than ever before. Tyler stared at it for a moment, then went to the doorway leading to the ladies\u2019 room and, after that, the music room. He found nothing in any of the rooms.</p><p>Nothing that wanted to be found, at any rate.</p><p>Julian wasn\u2019t even stirring. He certainly wasn\u2019t watching over the house where he\u2019d died.</p><p>When Tyler met Logan, who was checking the lock and the alarm on the back door, he asked, \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But we both needed the walk-through. Strange, I just had a feeling,\u201d Logan said. \u201cOur imaginations can come into play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but...sometimes it is something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s still some sleep to be had,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, let\u2019s get back up.\u201d</p><p>As they walked upstairs, Kelsey was coming out of the room she shared with Logan.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Sorry I woke you,\u201d Logan said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was awake, anyway. It does feel as if...as if there\u2019s something or someone in the house.\u201d</p><p>Logan slipped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cIf so, we\u2019re not the ones they want to talk to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Kelsey told Tyler, but she paused. \u201cMake sure you leave Allison\u2019s door open. And your own.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at her. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I was planning it.\u201d</p><p>Logan and Kelsey went to bed, and Tyler did the same, keeping his door half-open.</p><p>If anyone moved in the hall, he\u2019d hear it. He was a light sleeper.</p><p>If anyone made a move toward Allison in any way, he\u2019d know it.</p><p>Comfortable at last with that thought, he lay down again. He grinned, thinking about their ghost. He would\u2019ve been impatient with Julian\u2019s lack of responsibility in life, but he would have liked him.</p> <p>Julian had been intense when he\u2019d spoken with Tyler at Allison\u2019s house, while she was packing. He\u2019d charged him fiercely to ensure that Allison was safe.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s amazing, you know? There\u2019s no one like her. She has a great sense of humor, and she makes everything work and everyone get along. And she\u2019s so smart and beautiful and...you have to watch her every step, okay? We can\u2019t let anything happen to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Tyler had assured him.</p><p>\u201cMan, I was into her,\u201d Julian said sadly. \u201cBut she wanted...well, something I wasn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t help her or be there for her when I was alive, but now...now, I\u2019m a ghost! A bunch of air, a cold breeze. So it\u2019s gotta be you. You understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know how to protect people,\u201d Tyler had said.</p><p>\u201cFrom this?\u201d Julian had asked. \u201cFrom paintings that move and someone who can creep around behind you? You\u2019ve got to be wary\u2014every second. Every single second.\u201d</p> <p>And then the phone call had come.</p><p>Dixon had woken up and spoken one word.</p><p>Allison.</p><p>Tyler groaned, tossing in bed again. He had to sleep or he\u2019d be no good to anyone tomorrow.</p><p>He must have finally dozed. He dreamed about a giant black horse, rearing and snorting in the yard, carrying a beautiful young woman. Lucy Tarleton.</p><p>In his dreams, Lucy\u2019s face was Allison\u2019s.</p><p>When Allison awoke, she heard the others downstairs in the entry.</p><p>She felt good; she\u2019d slept extremely well.</p> <p>When she went to bed, she\u2019d been afraid she\u2019d be plagued by dreams all night long or that she\u2019d wake up to see another ghost sitting in the room.</p><p>But she\u2019d felt safe. Ridiculously safe. Tyler was across the hall, and there were five other agents in the house.</p><p>Until this was over, she knew darned well she wasn\u2019t leaving.</p><p>She hurried down the servants\u2019 stairs, delighted to find that the bath was empty. Showering quickly and dressing, she came out to join the others. Kat wasn\u2019t there, nor was Jane. But Kelsey, Logan, Sean and Tyler were together.</p><p>They were gathered around the bank of screens Sean had set up.</p><p>When she arrived, they turned, almost as one, to stare at her.</p><p>She stood still, looking back at them. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked. Her feeling of serenity from the night of undisturbed sleep began to evaporate.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou need to see this,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>She walked over to the screens, which showed six views of the house. One camera was in the upstairs hallway, one in the attic. One showed Angus Tarleton\u2019s study and another showed a view of the salon. The fifth displayed the front of the house.</p><p>The last camera was set to monitor activity in the entry.</p><p>She could see their group on the screen as they all watched the computers.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019m rolling back.\u201d</p><p>There was a timer set in a black margin at the top of each screen. Allison saw the hours roll back. She noticed something, a splinter of light, and then Sean slowed down the reverse, stopped and moved it forward.</p><p>She saw Tyler come out of his room and silently check on her, and then she saw Logan emerge, as well. They could be seen on the various screens as they came down the stairs and walked through the house, walked back up the stairs and met Kelsey on the second-floor landing.</p><p>\u201cYou woke up and checked out the house. That\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>At the foot of the stairs, a figure began to appear. It was that of a woman. She was hazy at first, but it might have been the low night-light that made her look as if she\u2019d arrived like a wraith.</p><p>Then again, she might have been a wraith.</p><p>She seemed to gather substance.</p><p>She moved from the stairway to the door that led to Angus Tarleton\u2019s study, and she paused there. Sean pushed a key on his computer board and they saw a close-up of the woman.</p><p>Allison\u2019s throat tightened. She would have gasped aloud\u2014if she hadn\u2019t felt that she was choking.</p><p>The woman was beautifully gowned in a Colonial-era dress; her stomacher was blue with white embroidery, her skirt was blue and the sleeves on her gown were white. Her hair, a soft brown, was tied back but curling tendrils escaped to frame her face.</p><p>Her face...</p><p>Allison had already accepted that a good friend she\u2019d seen murdered was now a ghost.</p><p>Why was this terrifying her so much? Because it made her feel as if she was a ghost herself?</p><p>Really, how could things get worse? Her friend was a ghost who believed she could discover the truth about his death. A man in a coma had called her name, and now she was seeing an image of a ghost, a ghost who looked just like her!</p><p>She backed away from the screen. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked, fear making her tone sharp. \u201cSome kind of trick photography?\u201d</p><p>Tyler laid a hand on her arm. \u201cAllison, it\u2019s not a trick, but it isn\u2019t anything that should upset you.\u201d</p><p>She jerked away. \u201cWhat, are you crazy? Are you creating footage for one of those stupid ghost shows?\u201d</p><p>They were all silent, not replying to her accusation.</p><p>She realized how brittle she sounded.</p><p>Mean, bitter and nasty. That wasn\u2019t her personality. And what she\u2019d accused them of wasn\u2019t what they were doing, and she knew it, but...</p><p>\u201cYou might have been related to her. Somehow,\u201d Sean said, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t! She didn\u2019t have children. She died.\u201d Allison shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen paintings of her.... She didn\u2019t resemble me. Not that closely, anyhow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t come downstairs, dress up and wander around the house last night, did you?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>Allison turned around with a sharp retort but it never left her lips. Kelsey was looking at her with empathy and understanding.</p><p>These people dealt with things like this all the time. None of it surprised them. Nothing surprised them.</p><p>She was still in denial. But she had a right to be! First, Julian. Now...this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a strong resemblance,\u201d Logan said. \u201cHowever, that doesn\u2019t really mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Her hair is nowhere near as dark as Allison\u2019s,\u201d Sean added.</p><p>Tyler wasn\u2019t speaking. She\u2019d moved away from him, and he was watching her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me, it wasn\u2019t me, and I\u2019m no relation to Lucy Tarleton,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not a descendent. I can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s just a resemblance,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Allison felt that her knees would go any second. This wasn\u2019t fair! She\u2019d felt so safe, as if the situation would really be solved, as if Julian\u2019s killer would be discovered and her life could go back to what it had been.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not geared up for this kind of thing.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey told her, \u201cHey, I understand. I always wanted to be a law enforcement officer, so finding out I had a few abilities that would help me with that wasn\u2019t...well, wasn\u2019t so hard to take. You\u2019re a professor, a scholar\u2014an academic. We can all understand how upsetting it must be, how frightening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a coward!\u201d she protested. But she was, and it was evident in her swift denial.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you some coffee,\u201d Kelsey offered, leaving the salon for the pantry.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stop you from going home, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to do,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cNo, we can\u2019t stop you, but...\u201d Logan turned her to face him. \u201cAllison, it\u2019s becoming very clear that you\u2019re the key to whatever is going on here. You can really help us. And if you decide to go back to your own house, we can\u2019t be there to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can have police cars patrol around your house, though,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cBut the cops only have so much manpower. It\u2019ll be hard for them to watch you,\u201d Sean pointed out.</p><p>Kelsey returned with a cup of coffee for her. \u201cWhen it\u2019s morning, no matter what the trauma, coffee makes it better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Julian?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe told him not to, but when Kat and Jane went to the morgue, Julian went with them,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Allison took her coffee and sank down into one of the chairs by the bank of screens. \u201cI haven\u2019t really been threatened,\u201d she said. \u201cNot by anyone living. Or anyone...not living. Julian is just worried. I don\u2019t know why he was killed. But there\u2019s no suggestion that whoever killed him would want to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we wait until there\u2019s a bayonet through your throat?\u201d Tyler asked harshly.</p><p>\u201cTyler,\u201d Kelsey murmured.</p><p>\u201cRun that image again, Sean,\u201d Tyler said, and his voice sounded tense.</p><p>\u201cI saw it the first time!\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cWell, see it again.\u201d</p><p>The image leaped to the screen again. Allison gritted her teeth.</p><p>Tyler hunkered down before her, his face just a breath away. \u201cYou\u2019re in danger. If you don\u2019t see it, you\u2019re the most idiotic academic I\u2019ve ever come across. Quit fighting it. If you want us to help you, accept the fact that someone in this house is trying to reach you, because someone outside this house is planning to kill you. Please\u2014trust me. Trust my experience. You are the catalyst here. The key and the answer. Accept it, and maybe you\u2019ll survive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>10</p><p>Allison tried to remain completely stoic and not let Tyler or any of them see the emotions sweeping through her.</p><p>She stared down into her coffee cup. She couldn\u2019t meet his eyes any longer.</p> <p>They were right about one thing. She didn\u2019t want to die!</p><p>As she gazed into her coffee, she felt a sensation of strength slowly begin to fill her veins. She looked up; Tyler was still there, his face just inches from hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here, aren\u2019t I?\u201d she told him softly. \u201cAlive...\u201d</p><p>Something in his expression changed. Something she was afraid to see. He cared. He had spoken harshly to her, but he really cared. She didn\u2019t know what had passed between them, but he was there to be her guardian.</p><p>\u201cPlease, admit that what\u2019s on that screen is unnerving!\u201d she said.</p> <p>He nodded grimly.</p><p>She\u2019d dressed up for years in the manner of Lucy Tarleton, and hosted tours through the house as if it were her own. She was young; Lucy had been young. There\u2019d been jokes about her resembling the young patriot many times before, but it was also true that she\u2019d never seen such a strong resemblance. And no one had ever suggested she was a spitting image of the long-dead heroine.</p><p>But it was just a resemblance. Maybe it had always been there.</p><p>Even if that was true, a ghost had shown up on film!</p><p>A ghost had been in or around the house, day after day....</p><p>And she had never known it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so much to take in, to get used to,\u201d Kelsey said gently. She nudged Tyler. He rose and stood near her, still watching intently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for sounding so cowardly. I\u2019m usually not the type of person who jumps at shadows or...\u201d Her voice faded away. She almost laughed and said, Or believes in ghosts and things that go bump in the night.</p><p>She didn\u2019t just believe in ghosts now.</p><p>She knew they existed.</p><p>She clenched her teeth tightly together.</p><p>Trying to run away from what was happening would only make it worse.</p><p>Allison squared her shoulders. She looked up at the group and said, \u201cI don\u2019t suppose it would help for me to go home. If I\u2019m the key to this thing as you say, then I guess Tyler was right. I\u2019d better start figuring out how to solve it. Where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that you have to go anywhere. It\u2019s that you have to open your mind to what you see and hear, and discover what the messages might be,\u201d Logan explained.</p> <p>\u201cBut we\u2019re supposed to be doing something, aren\u2019t we?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe are doing things,\u201d Logan assured her. \u201cKat and Jane are down at the morgue. We\u2019ve been studying the film we\u2019ve taken overnight. Sometimes, when the spirits don\u2019t reach out to us, we can see them on film, so at least we know they\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...that\u2019s it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only ten o\u2019clock,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cIf it was as easy as stepping inside and demanding that everyone who remained in the house show themselves and tell us what\u2019s up, we might be done already.\u201d She sat down next to Allison and continued. \u201cThe ghosts in this house may not have seen any more than you did. But they might know a great deal more about the past, and that could help us with the present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. But...\u201d</p><p>Logan stood up. He glanced at Tyler and then at her. \u201cListen, Allison, we\u2019ve gone over the house, the locks, the alarm system and every possible entry. Julian heard something and saw something. Someone was here. Someone living.\u201d He hesitated and looked at Tyler again. She realized he was trying to tell her something she wouldn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>\u201cWhoever caused Julian\u2019s death has to be someone you\u2019re close to, Allison,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWhoever was in the house is someone who has access to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian is dead, so that would leave Annette and Jason.\u201d Allison shook her head. \u201cNo, no\u2014I don\u2019t believe it was either of them. I know Annette was in agony from that tooth that needed the root canal. And I was with Jason. I watched him leave before...before I found Julian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve confirmed that Annette had a root canal done,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cYou checked out her story?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cWe check out everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also the board of directors,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Startled, Allison looked at him. \u201cAs in Ethan Oxford? He\u2019s not a small man. I can\u2019t see him trying to creep around this place! Julian, yes, he was young and spry and in excellent shape. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also Cherry Addison\u2014\u201d Tyler began.</p><p>\u201cCherry! We\u2019d have heard those spiked heels of hers a mile away,\u201d Allison interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAnd Sarah Vining and Nathan Pierson,\u201d he finished.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine our dignified board tiptoeing around the house to shove Julian\u2019s head down on a bayonet and then somehow traumatize Artie Dixon and send him into a coma,\u201d Allison said. \u201cHave you met our board? Well, I know you met Cherry, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met them all,\u201d Tyler told her. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to spend some more time with them. And, I\u2019m sorry to say, with Jason and Annette, as well.\u201d</p><p>Allison started to answer but fell silent as they heard a commotion at the door. Logan frowned and raised a brow at Tyler, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWe have to knock. People are living there now!\u201d they heard.</p><p>It was a feminine voice\u2014one Allison knew well.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to wait for the board. A few of them are already here,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDid you know they were coming?\u201d Logan asked Tyler.</p><p>Tyler shook his head as he walked to the door, unlocking it. Sarah stepped back in shock as the door opened; she had a hand on Nathan Pierson\u2019s arm. Nathan still held his key, ready to use it, and Cherry Addison was standing impatiently behind them.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cAgent Montague.\u201d Nathan spoke casually, grinning. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to see if you\u2019re settling in all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good God, Nathan, tell them the truth. We came to make sure you weren\u2019t putting garlic around the windows or doing anything to destroy the integrity of the property,\u201d Cherry told him. She smiled, though. Cherry really seemed to like Tyler.</p><p>\u201cCome and meet the rest of the Krewe,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd no, I guarantee that we don\u2019t put garlic around the windows.\u201d</p><p>As they filed in, Tyler began the introductions to Sean, Kelsey and Logan. When he\u2019d finished, he asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ethan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEthan\u2019s been friends with Adam Harrison for a long time. I believe they\u2019re at a fundraiser now, some kind of breakfast,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI\u2019d thought Adam would be the head honcho here,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cAdam puts things together. He\u2019s the organizer. We\u2019re the workers,\u201d Logan explained.</p><p>Allison noted that Sean had hit a key on the computer; the scenes depicted on all the screens were of the present.</p><p>Cherry Addison turned to her. \u201cSo, Allison, you\u2019re still showing the Krewe around. That\u2019s so kind of you, dear. You could be taking this time to hole up in your little room on campus and do your brilliant academic work.\u201d</p><p>Cherry had a way of speaking. Her words were benign enough, but her tone often contradicted them, with a sarcastic or disbelieving inflection that suggested the opposite of what she said. She seemed to be saying that Allison belonged in a stuffy university office or library.</p><p>\u201cCherry, you know how I love the house!\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cMs. Leigh has been extremely helpful,\u201d Tyler put in.</p><p>\u201cOf course, the house and its history are near and dear to us all.\u201d Sarah smiled at Allison. Bless Sarah; she was so like a nervous terrier, but her intentions were always the best. \u201cAnd I just can\u2019t believe that anyone\u2014anyone!\u2014would purposely hurt that young Mr. Mitchell. He was such a talented man,\u201d Sarah said sadly.</p><p>\u201cAnd a showoff, not to mention a goofball.\u201d Cherry\u2019s voice was caustic. \u201cWhat\u2019s most troubling is the type of story that keeps coming out in the media about that man\u2014Artie Dixon. They\u2019ve practically turned his coma into an alien invasion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry, that\u2019s one of the reasons Ethan was so keen on inviting this unit of law enforcement to come in,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cThey\u2019ll bring our historic property back into historic perspective.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut, even if that doesn\u2019t happen, everyone loves a good haunted house, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as people stop dying in it,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>She was surprised that she\u2019d spoken. She stood, uncomfortable with the words that had escaped her. A silence descended on the room.</p><p>Nathan looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Allison. As long as people stop dying in it. Well, we\u2019ll leave you to your work. We just thought we should drop by and see if you needed anything. Oh, as to the office. I can arrange to come and help you put things back in order, Allison.\u201d</p><p>Allison smiled at him. \u201cThanks, Nathan. I can do it on my own, but it\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could help,\u201d Cherry said, sounding reluctant. \u201cBut not today. Oh, my husband is having a gallery showing tomorrow evening. You must all come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry, they\u2019re here to work,\u201d Sarah reminded her.</p><p>\u201cAll work and no play...\u201d Cherry gestured expansively. \u201cThey need to breathe once in a while, Sarah. Please join us. The gallery is farther down on Walnut. Take a break and come by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you discovered anything?\u201d Sarah asked the group. \u201cIs it possible that Julian trashed the office before doing himself in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve really just begun, Ms. Vining,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cBut we will do our absolute best to find out the truth.\u201d</p><p>Sarah nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a luncheon date,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI need to get moving. But we do want you to let us know if you need anything. Anything at all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Logan said on behalf of the group.</p><p>\u201cI have to go and supervise some hangings,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cOf paintings and art pieces!\u201d she added quickly. \u201cOh, of course, the gallery owner hangs the painting, but I need to be there to see that everything\u2019s just right.\u201d</p><p>That drew smiles. Cherry seemed glad.</p> <p>\u201cI could stay now if you wanted,\u201d Sarah told Allison.</p><p>Tyler answered for her. \u201cWe were about to go out for a late breakfast. But if you\u2019re worried about any of the papers or materials that are out of order or might have been compromised, please feel free to come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that,\u201d Sarah said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you, Allison. You and I are both so careful about our research. I\u2019d really like to find out if anything was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sarah,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, we\u2019re out of here.\u201d Nathan paused and smiled at Allison again. \u201cThank you, Allison. Thanks for all you\u2019re doing for the house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure,\u201d she responded. \u201cI love the house and the history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do, dear,\u201d Cherry said, but somehow she made it sound like a reproach.</p><p>Tyler walked them all to the door. After another chorus of goodbyes, they were gone.</p><p>\u201cThey can enter this house at any time,\u201d he said as he returned.</p><p>\u201cWe could have asked for their keys,\u201d Allison told him.</p><p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t want them thinking they\u2019re under suspicion. What we do need is an alarm system that\u2019ll alert us if anyone tries to enter with a key. Can you work on that, Sean?\u201d</p> <p>Logan turned to Allison. \u201cOn the day Julian died, did you see them all leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, as my last tour was coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Julian came into the house, and you didn\u2019t see him. So one of them could have doubled back,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnnette was at the dentist, but where were you when Jason left? The house couldn\u2019t have been locked until he was out and you closed up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see Jason leave the house?\u201d Logan asked her.</p><p>\u201cI heard Jason shut the door, but I didn\u2019t actually see him go. I did notice the board leaving, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them could\u2019ve come back in, and you wouldn\u2019t have known it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be,\u201d she said, and she knew her tone sounded desperate. \u201cAnnette, Jason and I all got mad at Julian, but none of us would have killed him. And I can\u2019t think of any reason that a member of the board would have killed Julian. They could simply have fired him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could fire him\u2014but that wouldn\u2019t help if he knew something he shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Kelsey said.</p> <p>\u201cBreakfast,\u201d Logan announced. \u201cOr nearly lunch if you prefer. Hungry investigators don\u2019t concentrate well. Let\u2019s get something to eat and stoke up for the day. Then we\u2019ll get started in earnest here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just walk to your friend\u2019s restaurant,\u201d Tyler suggested. \u201cWhat time does it open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Evan\u2019s place? McDooley\u2019s? He opens at eleven,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t suspect Evan in this, do you?\u201d she asked, her tone wry.</p><p>\u201cNo, I suspect a board member, Jason or Annette, and I\u2019m sorry, because I know that hurts you. And after the way she just insisted on going into the office with you, I want to know more about Sarah Vining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah? But she\u2019s...\u201d Allison began, not sure how to say what she meant.</p><p>\u201cBecause she looks fragile, sweet, eternally nervous and innocent?\u201d Kelsey asked. \u201cNever trust appearances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all speculating right now,\u201d Logan said. \u201cSean, can you quickly rig up an alarm for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, got the camera aimed at the door and a zip connection to my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cMcDooley\u2019s was a great place and I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>They all agreed. Still shaking inwardly, Allison wondered how they could forget what they\u2019d seen and think about something as mundane as food. But they were obviously used to bizarre occurrences....</p><p>Evan beamed delightedly when Allison walked in with Tyler, Kelsey, Logan and Sean.</p><p>\u201cHey, thanks! You did come back with friends,\u201d he said to Tyler.</p><p>\u201cWe need a hangout.\u201d Tyler grinned. \u201cAllison, introduce Evan around, will you?\u201d</p><p>She did so, and then her eyes widened as she saw Jason walking up to her. He was wearing a McDooley\u2019s polo shirt and jeans.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ally, oh, Lord! How are you? You poor girl, finding Julian like that... And I\u2019d just been bitching about him. I wish I\u2019d at least been with you when you found him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s horrible, yes, and we\u2019re all devastated, but...\u201d She tried to smile. \u201cBut you\u2019re working. Evan told me to get in touch with you and Annette. I just hadn\u2019t had a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called him right away. I figured he\u2019d lend a hand. I desperately need to work, since I still have to pay for school.\u201d Jason kissed her cheek. \u201cThankfully, Evan said he could use the help.\u201d He stood back, smiling curiously and waiting to meet the others. \u201cI\u2019m really pleased you\u2019re here,\u201d he told the Krewe. \u201cI admit...I was mad as hell at Julian. He seemed to believe he was a star and that our little lives didn\u2019t matter next to his. But you couldn\u2019t help liking him. We\u2019re all reeling after his death.\u201d He looked at Allison. \u201cYou holding up okay? The police came and gave me the third degree, but I heard you were at the station all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad they grilled us. We owe it to Julian to figure out exactly what happened,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jason frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean? Julian was messing around the way he always did, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she lied. She assumed the Krewe didn\u2019t want others knowing about their suspicions. \u201cThese people are going to find out what\u2014if anything\u2014is going on at the house.\u201d</p><p>He still seemed surprised. \u201cI heard about your unit coming in. I\u2019m just not sure what this can do for Julian. Well, nothing can be done for Julian now, of course. But, anyway, sit. I\u2019ll get your orders and you can tell me anything else you think I need to know. Or ask me anything you want,\u201d he told the Krewe members.</p><p>Jason escorted them over to one of his booths. He made suggestions, and they ordered their meals and five glasses of iced tea.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s Jason,\u201d Tyler said as he watched him leave.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid. And it wouldn\u2019t have made any sense for him to do anything to Julian,\u201d Allison said earnestly. She was seated next to Tyler. Kelsey was between Logan and Sean on the other side of the booth. \u201cJason wants to keep going to school. You heard him. He needs an income.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey reached across the table and squeezed her hand. She said, \u201cI admire your loyalty to your friends. During a case in San Antonio, I learned the hard way that we never know another person as well as we think we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you got me out of the deal, right?\u201d Logan teased.</p><p>Allison was touched by the closeness between them, and yet when they worked together, you wouldn\u2019t know they were a couple.</p><p>Everyone in the Krewe seemed close to and dependent on one another. Their easy manner didn\u2019t interfere with their professionalism and only seemed to enhance it.</p><p>\u201cSo, you all met on a case?\u201d she asked them.</p><p>Logan said, \u201cYes, we did. Kelsey was the outsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest of us are from Texas,\u201d Sean explained.</p><p>\u201cBut you work out of Virginia?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>Sean nodded. \u201cNow we do. And the way we work...works, somehow. Will Chan, one of the original Krewe members, was involved in our last case. He\u2019s back with his crew while Kat, who was lead on that investigation, is back with us. They\u2019re fortunate, though. They became a couple and found a great place in Arlington to call home when we\u2019re on base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean isn\u2019t so lucky,\u201d Kelsey said, punching his shoulder lightly. \u201cThe love of his life actually has his old job in California. She\u2019s with one of the premier special effects studios in Hollywood. So they have to get together when they can.\u201d</p><p>Sean looked at her with a grimace and lifted his glass of iced tea. \u201cIt can work\u2014if you want it to. We do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy poor cousin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten you\u2019re cousins,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see a family resemblance?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t really looking for one, but yeah...the eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenetics can be unpredictable. Certain characteristics can skip generations and reappear. Luckily, sometimes that happens with inherited diseases, too. Sometimes they\u2019ll skip enough generations for cures to be discovered,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>Allison realized that Tyler was studying her. She felt a rush of warmth; he was probably thinking about the image of the wraithlike Lucy Tarleton\u2014and just how much she and Allison resembled each other.</p><p>She also realized she liked being where she was. There was something about Tyler that evoked trust. The man was six-four-plus and built of steel, and that surely led to a feeling of safety. But she liked the feel of him, the clean scent of him, his deep voice....</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about him in any kind of physical way. She was a tool for him and his team, and they were providing her with a safe haven. To suddenly enjoy the presence of this particular man was not wise. Especially since her taste in men hadn\u2019t proven to be at all that reliable in the past.</p><p>Apparently, his thoughts didn\u2019t quite match hers because he asked, \u201cCan you trace your ancestry back to the Revolution? You\u2019re a historian, so I imagine you know your own family history.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cMy dad\u2019s family, yes. They\u2019ve been in Philly since the 1700s. I lose count of the greats, but I have family buried at Christ Church graveyard\u2014not all that far from Benjamin Franklin. In fact, I think the monument is close enough for pennies to fall on great-great-great-whatever granddad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPennies? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocal tradition has it that tossing pennies on Ben\u2019s grave brings financial good fortune.\u201d</p><p>Logan grinned. \u201cWell, that kind of contradicts that proverb of his\u2014a penny saved is a penny earned.\u201d</p> <p>They all laughed. Tyler asked, \u201cDid you have a great-great-great-whatever fighting in the Revolution?\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. \u201cWilliam Peter Leigh. He survived the war and lived to the ripe old age of eighty-seven. He\u2019s at Christ Church with his two wives, several of his children and their children. My mother\u2019s from a more recent wave of Irish immigrants. They came to New York during the Famine and then made their way over to Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be interesting to find out more about your family,\u201d Logan murmured.</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to do, but as Tyler said, I\u2019m a historian, and I\u2019m familiar with my own family background. I am not related to the Tarleton or the Dandridge families. The Philadelphia Department of Records has my dad\u2019s family history generation by generation\u2014and a lot of what\u2019s in the Department of Records can be verified by church records. Same with the Tarleton family. Angus Tarleton had two children, Lucy and Sophia. Lucy died, and you can trace the Dandridge family, as well. The name died out with Cherry Addison\u2019s mother.\u201d She sipped her iced tea. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure why this is relevant. You tell me that what was done to Julian wasn\u2019t done by a ghost. So how can the past matter so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might and it might not,\u201d Logan said vaguely. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we get back into the office, I\u2019d like to keep going through the papers and records that were thrown around up there.\u201d Tyler smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019d also like a better tour of the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the stables and the graveyard?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I looked around quickly when I first arrived, but there\u2019s nothing like a good tour\u2014with a knowledgeable guide.\u201d</p><p>As he finished speaking, Jason and a few other servers appeared with their meals. \u201cCareful if you\u2019re driving out on the highway,\u201d he told them. \u201cThere was a massive accident on US1.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re just showing it on the television up at the bar,\u201d Jason was saying. \u201cIt looks like at least ten cars are involved and two trucks have turned over. I\u2019m afraid there are going to be some fatalities.\u201d</p> <p>Allison slid out of the booth and followed Jason over to the bar. A reporter was at the scene of the crash, and she saw a twisted mass of steel on the road. One car had flipped and fallen on another. One truck was on its side, another stretched across the road, forming a barrier.</p><p>Staring at the tangle, she gasped. \u201cJason, that car\u2014it\u2019s a blue Volvo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>They were thinking the same thing.</p><p>Sarah Vining drove a blue Volvo.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not jump to conclusions,\u201d Jason said. \u201cThere must be a lot of blue Volvos in the Philly area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah said she\u2019d always drive a Volvo because it was the safest car on the road,\u201d Allison whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, and it is a Volvo, so even if Sarah\u2019s in that car, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p> <p>Allison noticed Tyler standing next to her and saw that he had his phone out. He was speaking to someone who could zero in on the license plate and pull up the vehicle records.</p><p>She and Jason waited anxiously as he spoke. He grunted replies, finished with a terse \u201cThanks,\u201d and snapped his phone shut. He looked from Jason to Allison.</p><p>\u201cThe car does belong to Sarah Vining,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom what the police have determined so far, Sarah was the one who caused the accident.\u201d</p><p>11</p><p>While Logan spoke with officers at the accident scene, Tyler found the ambulance bearing Sarah Vining to the hospital. After showing his I.D., he was permitted to join the EMTs. The siren was blaring but he could make out what they were saying behind him.</p><p>The EMTs were troubled, speaking urgently with doctors while en route, doing their best to save the woman.</p><p>The Volvo she had so depended on had stood her in good stead; she had slammed into one of the trucks and her air bag had inflated to protect her.</p><p>But while cars continued to slam into one another around her, Sarah had done the unthinkable\u2014she had stumbled out of her car. She\u2019d been hit by another vehicle and hurled several feet in the air.</p><p>Sarah lay bruised and broken with an IV in her arm\u2014unresponsive to anything that was said or done to her as the medical techs strove diligently to keep her alive.</p><p>When they reached the emergency room, she was immediately wheeled in.</p><p>Tyler wasn\u2019t allowed entry, but he identified himself to the emergency room doctor and told him he\u2019d be waiting for any information or any possibility of talking to the woman. While the doctor seemed surprised that a federal agent was so determined to see a vehicular accident victim, he agreed as he hurried off.</p><p>Tyler paced the waiting room. He\u2019d been suspicious of the woman just before this happened. And he was still suspicious\u2014although no longer of Sarah herself.</p><p>He wanted to know what would cause the woman to lose control of her vehicle as she had. And why in God\u2019s name would she crawl out of the car?</p><p>More victims from the accident arrived at the hospital. It was controlled chaos as those with the severest injuries were treated first and the triage nurses worked at a record pace to see that everyone was taken in according to need.</p><p>Tyler followed one of the EMTs outside, where the man had just leaned against a wall to draw a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The EMT nodded. \u201cTwenty-four people. I\u2019m praying they all make it. One guy was bleeding like a sieve. There were a few children...but I think they\u2019re going to be okay. A broken arm, a few bumps and bruises, trauma from air bags. It\u2019s been a rough day.\u201d He offered Tyler a weak smile. \u201cNo one at the morgue yet, though, and we thought we\u2019d see a lot of dead.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou have a family member involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, so far, everyone\u2019s hanging in.\u201d</p><p>He went back to the emergency waiting room and sat down beside a woman with her arm in a makeshift sling, hoping for a chance to ask her what she\u2019d seen without looking like an ambulance chaser or a voyeur.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to worry; she just started talking. \u201cIt was unbelievable!\u201d she said, turning to him with wide eyes. \u201cThe woman in the blue Volvo was in front of me, driving, and then she threw her arms up and started screaming. A few seconds later, she veered into the next lane, crashing into a truck and spinning into me! Then another car hit the truck and another car hit me.... Why on earth would she suddenly do that? Oh, my God, I\u2019ll never forget the sound. It was awful, just awful...the screeching of brakes, the cars all slamming together. Were you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019m so sorry for everyone who was hurt,\u201d Tyler told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m alive!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did see the woman driving. And she was fine at first, and then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was as if she went crazy. As if she was struck by lightning or possessed by a demon or something. I knew to get away from her but it was too late\u2014it all happened so fast!\u201d</p><p>Tears appeared in her eyes. Tyler placed a comforting hand on her arm. \u201cThank God you\u2019re all right,\u201d he said sincerely.</p><p>He saw the doctor who\u2019d been with Sarah Vining when she was wheeled in.</p><p>Tyler excused himself, stood and walked over to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to tell you this. Ms. Vining was declared dead about four minutes ago,\u201d the doctor told him.</p><p>\u201cHer injuries were that extensive?\u201d Tyler asked, feeling deep pity for the woman, and a sense of loss. He also felt the tension of needing to find out how she\u2019d died.</p><p>He knew she hadn\u2019t just \u201cgone crazy\u201d and caused the accident. Waiting to hear what had happened was like waiting for a hammer to fall.</p><p>\u201cSnakebite,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cSnakebite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe EMTs were at a loss because they couldn\u2019t see the bite. There must\u2019ve been a snake in her car. A copperhead? They\u2019ll know for sure when they\u2019ve finished the autopsy. She was bitten. The bite probably caused her to lose control of the car. Her other injuries led us astray at first, and between the trauma of the accident and the poison...Ms. Vining succumbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Where will she be taken?\u201d Tyler paused. \u201cYou\u2019re sure? She was bitten by a snake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I still have people here to see, but check it out for yourself.\u201d He nodded to one of the nurses in the hall. The young man came forward to direct Tyler into the room where Sarah Vining lay on the operating table.</p><p>Tyler touched her\u2014she was still warm. But she looked dead. Her face was ashen and gray, and bruises were beginning to show on her flesh. She\u2019d been a tiny woman; she now looked shrunken, almost as if she were being mummified with each second that passed.</p><p>\u201cBite is just above her knee on the inner thigh,\u201d the nurse told him.</p><p>Tyler moved the sheet. There was no doubt that she\u2019d been bitten by a snake. The wound had begun to blacken and go raw before she\u2019d died.</p><p>\u201cThank you. She will go to autopsy, right?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He left the hospital and returned to the Tarleton-Dandridge House, suddenly anxious to be with Allison again.</p><p>He knew there was a killer now. A killer who had procured a copperhead\u2014easy enough in the woods nearby, or even in barns and basements\u2014and put it in Sarah\u2019s car.</p><p>The killer had taken chances. Sarah might have seen the snake. If she\u2019d been able to speak long enough, she might have told the emergency rescue personnel she\u2019d been bitten. And if they\u2019d given her the antidote along with their other life-saving techniques, she might have survived. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, this killer had taken a chance. He\u2019d injured scores of people in that accident\u2014just to kill Sarah Vining.</p><p>When he opened the door, he saw Sean watching the screens by himself.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Allison?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the attic with Logan and Kelsey, going through papers,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah Vining is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crash killed her?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014combined with a copperhead bite.\u201d</p><p>Sean sat back. As he did so Allison came running down the stairs. She knew from his face that the news was bad.</p> <p>Logan followed her down more slowly.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Tyler shook his head.</p><p>Allison stopped at the bottom of the stairs. \u201cShe\u2019s dead? Sarah Vining is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Shaking, she sank onto a step. \u201cBut it was an automobile accident. We saw it on the news. It couldn\u2019t have anything to do with what\u2019s happening here.\u201d</p> <p>He walked over and sat beside her. She wasn\u2019t crying; she just stared ahead, dazed.</p><p>\u201cAllison, it wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cI saw it. I saw it on TV. Dozens of cars and people were involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a snake in her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA...snake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was bitten by a copperhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you can survive a snakebite! People survive them all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison, between the snakebite and the trauma of the crash, she died. She caused the crash\u2014because she\u2019d been bitten by a snake. That\u2019s not an accident.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a copperhead being in anyone\u2019s car, but I have heard of people finding them in their basements or garages,\u201d she said. Then she gasped, taking in the reality of another death. \u201cOh, poor Sarah. She was always such a sad little creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJulian and Sarah. Three days apart. We need to be vigilant. Someone is trying to keep some kind of information from being discovered,\u201d Logan said. He walked around in front of Allison. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know you\u2019ve lost a friend, and now another coworker. This is far more painful for you than we can begin to understand, but the harder we work at learning the truth, the better our chances of saving others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone is trying to kill everyone associated with the house?\u201d Allison asked him bluntly.</p><p>\u201cOnly people who might know something,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re speculating, but we\u2019re pretty good at sorting things out. This morning, Sarah was talking about getting back into the office. Maybe she came across some kind of information in there the day Julian died. The board was meeting up there, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The word sounded like a sob. He put his arm around her shoulders, thinking that she might well push him away again\u2014but she didn\u2019t. \u201cAllison, you\u2019ve been hit with a lot. Two friends dead, the ghost of a friend, the appearance of a ghost that looks like you and a man in a coma saying your name. It\u2019s too much to take in. We understand. But I believe you are on to something about the house that someone doesn\u2019t want the world to know. Someone who didn\u2019t care who they killed in that accident.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt has to be an employee\u2014or one of the board members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re down one board member and one employee,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the tour groups that were in the house?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe might have had someone on one of the tours who was just crazy, or had some bizarre agenda? We can\u2019t watch every person every minute they\u2019re in here. Someone could have slipped away. And that person could have gotten out, too. I hadn\u2019t set the alarm when I found Julian\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Logan told her.</p><p>\u201cBut unlikely,\u201d Sean said from behind the screens. He came over to them and spoke to Allison. \u201cFrom what I understand about the boy whose dad is in a coma, the kid\u2019s convinced that the ghost of Beast Bradley likes you, Allison. I think we should try to coax either Lucy Tarleton or Beast Bradley into appearing to you. If you can get close enough to one or even both of them, they might be able to help. You never know what a ghost might know.\u201d</p><p>The door opened; Jane and Kat had returned. They were followed by Julian, who was arguing with Kat.</p><p>\u201cThat was horrible\u2014and completely undignified!\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJulian!\u201d Kat set her handbag on a side table and turned to him. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t asked that they shave your head, we wouldn\u2019t know that you\u2019d formed a hematoma. A bruise. Someone had cracked you on the head to get your chin into that blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you what happened,\u201d Julian said. \u201cGood Lord, doesn\u2019t anyone listen to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all listen to you. And we believe you, Julian,\u201d Jane said, trying to calm him down. \u201cBut we can\u2019t go into a courtroom and tell a jury that your ghost told us what happened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t bad enough to see myself with that...that Y incision!\u201d Julian moaned.</p><p>\u201cI told you not to come with us,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Julian saw that the others were watching him. \u201cOkay, so I shouldn\u2019t have gone. But I felt I had to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Kat continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve proven that what you said is true. If I hadn\u2019t done what I did, the medical examiner might still be thinking it was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked him not to let anything out to the press yet?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>Kat nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sound and decent guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe M.E. on Julian\u2019s case was a woman. She\u2019s about sixty, and I believe she\u2019ll be extremely discreet,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Julian walked over to Allison. \u201cSee? I told you I was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t disbelieve you,\u201d Allison told him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to solve this,\u201d Jane assured Julian. Then she paused, looking at the others. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you. Didn\u2019t you get my message?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Jane fumbled in her pocket. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have our phones. I didn\u2019t think to check for messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a huge pileup on US1,\u201d Logan said. He went on to explain that he and Tyler had gone to the site, and that Tyler had accompanied Sarah to the hospital.</p><p>And that Sarah had died.</p><p>And the way she\u2019d died.</p><p>\u201cWe have to move fast on this,\u201d Jane murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to get me in to the autopsy,\u201d Kat said urgently, addressing Logan.</p><p>\u201cSarah is...dead? Too?\u201d Julian asked. \u201cAnd it was made to look like another accident. With a snake. Lord, someone\u2019s pushing it. I\u2019m really sorry about Sarah. I\u2019m still really sorry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy condolences, Allison,\u201d Jane said. \u201cBut...we need to figure out what\u2019s going on. I can play with the different paintings and pictures, and see what I can learn by doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to get started now?\u201d Logan asked Jane.</p><p>\u201cYes, unless you need me for anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d like to see what you discover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019ll discover?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cThe truth,\u201d Jane told her.</p><p>Allison smiled at that. \u201cThe truth about...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe past owners of the house and those who dwelt within,\u201d Jane said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find it fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need help setting up?\u201d Sean asked her.</p><p>\u201cYou can grab the box with the printer and scanner,\u201d Jane said. \u201cI\u2019m going to set up shop in the grand salon.\u201d She turned to Allison. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry. I have protective covers for the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not worried about artifacts anymore,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do some sketches, photos and comparisons of the paintings in the house. If anyone wants me, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be.\u201d She shrugged, smoothing back her hair. \u201cWell, whether you want me or not, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, get Kelsey\u2014she\u2019s out in the yard. If we\u2019re lucky, you can reach the records office before they close and at least start seeing what you can dig up. I\u2019ll spell Sean at the screens so he can get some rest.\u201d Logan looked at Tyler, and Tyler looked at Allison.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get back into the office and sort out those papers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut before it\u2019s too late and too dark, I\u2019d like to see the rest of the grounds\u2014through your eyes. I\u2019ve been wanting to do that and circumstances keep getting in the way. Let\u2019s do it now. I\u2019d like you to show me the stables and the family graveyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Allison said slowly.</p><p>Julian shuddered. \u201cGraveyard! I think I\u2019ll sit with Jane for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t drive me crazy!\u201d Jane warned him.</p><p>Julian grinned at Allison. \u201cI woulda had a big crush on her!\u201d he said. He spoke lightly, but she saw the sadness in his eyes. She wanted to give him a warm hug filled with comfort but, of course, she couldn\u2019t. And he bent down instead as if he was trying to hug her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Allison. Maybe Sarah...maybe she\u2019ll be like me. She\u2019d love to stay in this old place forever. She adored the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not helping me, Julian,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, I\u2019m sorry, not the right thing to say. Okay, well...hmm. I guess I\u2019ll go \u2018haunt\u2019 the gorgeous Jane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were gorgeous yourself, my friend,\u201d Allison told him. \u201cYou were.\u201d</p><p>He smiled wistfully at her and turned to head into the salon. Sean stood and stretched, and Logan took over his seat.</p><p>\u201cShall we see the property now?\u201d Tyler asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Allison said. \u201cGive me a minute. I want to rinse my face.\u201d She drew in a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll hear from the rest of the board soon, I imagine. They\u2019ll want to arrange something for Sarah.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded. He watched her rise stiffly and walk toward the pantry.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been as close to Sarah as she had to Julian.</p> <p>But she\u2019d lost someone, and everyone deserved a few tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Allison was true to her word. She just needed cold water on her face and a moment alone to breathe.</p><p>Now Sarah was dead, too.</p><p>But these people, the Krewe, were here to help.</p> <p>So she was going to help them by doing whatever she could.</p><p>She met Tyler back in the salon and motioned for him to follow her.</p><p>The narrow hallway in the foyer led straight to the back door; the Tarleton-Dandridge was, despite its grandiose styling, still a shotgun house. The hall had allowed the breeze to sweep right through on hot days.</p><p>\u201cThe back can be accessed through the pantry and the music room,\u201d Tyler noted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same door, but the music room and the pantry lead toward it from either side of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other doors? Nothing we might have missed?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire escape out of Lucy Tarleton\u2019s room. If you look out the right-hand window, you\u2019ll see it. It\u2019s a legal requirement,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tyler stopped at the twenty-foot expanse between the house and the stables.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI saw the horse,\u201d he said. He looked at her. \u201cAnd the dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirewalker and Robert?\u201d Had he seen them or had he imagined them?</p><p>\u201cThe horse was beautiful, a huge black stallion, about seventeen hands tall,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAnd the dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig old hound or maybe some kind of hound mix. Huge and tawny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was a wolfhound mix,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cNice dog,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a dog like that. Of course, I guess back then, he had lots of room to run. He wouldn\u2019t really make an apartment dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou live in an apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the moment.\u201d He scanned the property as they spoke and then his eyes settled on her. \u201cI lived most of my life in San Antonio, but as you know, our main office is in Arlington, Virginia. Our permanent homes are there now. I want to get a house, and there\u2019s still plenty of land around us. The closer you get to the Capitol, of course, the harder it becomes to have much of a property. But I\u2019d like to have a horse again, and a dog\u2014something like the ghost dog, an enormous old hound, loyal to the core.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso furry, muddy and dirty,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cAh, you\u2019re not a dog girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love dogs! I\u2019ll have you know that my little mutt lived to the ripe old age of nineteen. I got him when he was six weeks old and I was four, and we didn\u2019t lose him until I\u2019d graduated after my first stint at college.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready for another dog after him, I guess.\u201d</p><p>He looked out over the property, glad that she seemed to be speaking calmly, that she wasn\u2019t in shock the way she\u2019d been after Julian\u2019s death.</p><p>\u201cRobert must have been a great dog,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI suspect he went everywhere with Lucy Tarleton and that she had to convince him to stay\u2014maybe with her sister, maybe she got a servant to lock him up\u2014every time she made one of her rides down to Valley Forge.\u201d He pointed across the stables. \u201cHow do you suppose she pulled it off? The family groom must have been loyal to her, and she had to be an excellent rider to slip through the British military that surrounded the city at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was passionate about her cause. She\u2019d grown up here and knew the area well, while the British were on foreign soil. I think you\u2019re right\u2014the groom knew what she was doing and helped her. If she was caught, she could act the part of a stricken woman, just trying to reach a wounded cousin or friend. She probably played the \u2018I\u2019m just a woman\u2019 card many times. We can\u2019t know the details.\u201d Allison paused, shrugging lightly. \u201cWe get history in one big package, all tied up with the outcome known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2014and it\u2019s human nature to invent or embroider some of those details. We do know she died, but no one was there when it happened\u2014except her father, according to what I\u2019ve read. There could be no torture worse for a father than seeing his daughter killed.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cThat was the outcome. I like to think about her before the end. Lucy Tarleton didn\u2019t know she\u2019d get caught when she was riding through the night. But so many people took huge risks, even though they knew the punishment for what they were doing could be death. It\u2019s strange, you make me think of the colonists\u2019 day-to-day life in a way I haven\u2019t for a while. And about Lucy. She was like any other woman of any other time. She loved her dog, and her dog was fiercely loyal and loving to her.\u201d Allison shivered. \u201cI can only imagine the day Beast Bradley caught her. She was returning from one of her spy missions, but I don\u2019t believe he ever proved she was spying. I think he found out about Stewart Douglas\u2014that\u2019s how the story came down to us, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl with a dog and a horse,\u201d Tyler murmured.</p><p>\u201cThe dog was killed, you know. According to the legend. I\u2019m hoping he ripped his attacker to shreds before he went down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he fought tooth and nail,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cMaybe he stays around because he\u2019s looking for Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the horse wasn\u2019t killed,\u201d Allison told him. \u201cActually, the fate of the horse is a curious one. The British took him when they evacuated Philadelphia. But he wound up back here\u2014he\u2019s buried in the graveyard, too. So is the dog. There\u2019s an area toward the rear for family pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go see it, shall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Allison smiled at him.</p><p>There\u2019d been something about their conversation here that was wistful and poignant. Allison wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d thought about him before, other than that unmistakable attraction, but they seemed to be drawing closer.</p><p>Maybe she needed to back away. She\u2019d lost friends. She was learning all about the world beneath what was seen, and she was coming in contact with entities that were uninvited.</p><p>But it felt as if Tyler had now been part of her life forever, although it had just been a few days. She was becoming dependent on him. He could be harsh, but only to make her see.</p><p>He was definitely an imposing person.</p><p>Maybe any time a tall man with a gun came from Texas, the rest of the world automatically assumed cowboy. He was tall, extremely well-built, and now that they\u2019d shared a quiet moment thinking about the lives of others rather than their deaths, she knew she liked his mind and the way he thought. She suddenly knew that he wasn\u2019t just attractive, he was...sexually appealing. For the past few months, she\u2019d refused to even consider a relationship with anyone, not after her last fiasco....</p><p>Another person had died. And here she was, thinking about this man.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d she said, turning away from him. \u201cThe graveyard! The family plot. Well, let me get into tour guide mode here.\u201d She moved past him. Allison wondered if, when this mystery was solved, he would go back to Virginia, or on to another city to solve another problem. She would always remember this moment, standing in the yard, reflecting on the life of a long-dead woman and the simple human fact that she had loved her dog.This moment, because it was when Allison discovered she was intrigued and excited by being near him. She wondered what it would be like to really touch him....</p><p>She launched into her talk. \u201cThe stables, as you see, are to your right. There\u2019s actually work space in the old servants\u2019 quarters over the stables. There are stalls for eight horses, a tack room and a little office. The watering trough is still there\u2014it\u2019s the original stone trough. The stalls themselves are wood and have been repaired over the years, but the circular carving on the gates to the individual stalls is original. As we pass the stables, we come to the family graveyard. It was a huge property back then, so it was natural that household members were buried here. During the yellow fever epidemic, the family moved out of the city and came back afterward. They were blessed. None of the Dandridge family died.\u201d She paused. \u201cYou probably know that a yellow fever epidemic swept through Philadelphia in the summer of 1793.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been reading up.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know as much as you do, but yes, the then-capital city had a population of about fifty-five thousand. Dolley Madison lost her first husband and two of her children during the epidemic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the Dandridge family was smart\u2014they got out. They weren\u2019t here when the criers went through the town saying, \u2018Bring out your dead, bring out your dead!\u2019\u201d</p><p>She looked at the stables; she went through them so often. Cleaned out now, as they\u2019d been since the turn of the twentieth century, they still smelled of leather, horses, cigars and polish. The upstairs had been converted to caretaker apartments long ago, before the house was bequeathed to Old Philly History.</p><p>\u201cGraveyard now?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cOr are you stalling?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhy worry about a graveyard? A ghost appeared to me in my living room. What else is there to fear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the dead, usually nothing. Although...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, the dead can be evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t involved with the cases, but a few times, when someone really evil died somewhere\u2014that somewhere being a place where they\u2019d killed and tortured others\u2014there was a remnant of evil that lingered. But the ghosts didn\u2019t kill. Sometimes, maybe evil attracts evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe the Tarleton-Dandridge family was evil in any way, so the family graveyard should be safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thankfully, it is broad daylight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She started walking ahead, leading him past the stables.</p><p>The old family graveyard had the right aura. There were several vaults dedicated to the family, and there were plots with large angels and obelisks, memorials to other family members.</p><p>\u201cA lot of people found a last resting place here,\u201d Tyler commented.</p> <p>\u201cThey often had big families back then. Sophia and Tobias Dandridge had seven children, and those children went off and had more children, and that was over two hundred years ago, so...\u201d</p><p>A small brick wall, about three feet high, surrounded the burying ground. There was a little picket fence at the entry, and stones had been laid out as walkways.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re looking for Lucy first?\u201d Allison asked Tyler.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d like to see her grave. But I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s in the chapellike vault over there\u2014center, toward the rear. The one that says Tarleton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s in there. Lucy, her father, her mother, her father\u2019s parents, one aunt who never married and an uncle who\u2019d been an Episcopal priest,\u201d Allison told him. \u201cA few of the family who came before Angus are there, too, but the vault was constructed while the Revolution was being waged, so the others were reentombed. At least I assume so.\u201d</p> <p>They skirted angels and cherubs and two smaller vaults to reach the largest and finest of the vaults, which was guarded by a metal gate and a wooden door. Allison thought Tyler was surprised when she pulled open the gate.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not locked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s actually a nice little chapel, as well. It has an altar, a few benches and a stained-glass window in back. Lucy\u2019s uncle James is buried under the altar. There\u2019s a pretty monument to her aunt Cecilia toward the front, and we believe she\u2019s buried there. You\u2019ll see monuments on the other walls, and those are to Angus\u2019s parents and a few other family members. And Lucy, Angus and Susannah\u2014Lucy\u2019s mother\u2014are in marble tombs just behind the altar, beneath the stained-glass window. They\u2019re really striking\u2014reminiscent of Renaissance tombs.\u201d</p><p>Allison wasn\u2019t sure why, but when she entered the vault, she bypassed the old stone benches and walked around the altar to come to the middle of the tombs at the rear. Light was streaming through the cut-glass windows high above, casting dancing rays upon the effigies of the three Tarleton family members.</p><p>Lucy was in the middle. Sculpted out of marble, she seemed beautifully at peace. Her long hair crowned her head and face; she held a bouquet of flowers in her hands. Her mother\u2019s tomb was similar\u2014flowers seemed to be the object of choice for the sculptor when it came to women\u2014while Angus was holding a book.</p><p>\u201cWow, impressive tombs. They must be the only ones like this in the city.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen many like them. Seriously, they look as if they belong in Notre Dame or Westminster Abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExceptionally fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you expecting to find Lucy rotting away in a shroud, entombed in a wall?\u201d Allison asked him, a note of teasing reproach in her voice.</p><p>\u201cHonestly? Yes. Not that it really matters what becomes of the body once we\u2019re gone. Unless, of course, you do remain behind and have to watch,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cHas she ever been disinterred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness, no! That would be akin to blasphemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just curious. We take for granted that the history that came down to us was true\u2014that Lord Bradley killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, there hasn\u2019t been much reason to doubt it. From all accounts, the Tarleton family was a loving one. The history comes from Sophia and her husband, Tobias Dandridge. They loved Lucy, they were patriots\u2014and there was no reason for them to lie about what happened,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe might not have completely firm and unimpeachable evidence, but I\u2019ve always believed their version. I\u2019m not sure why you think it\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m just questioning the telling of this particular tale.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, the paintings of Lord Brian Bradley. They\u2019re so different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo different artists.\u201d</p><p>Tyler shrugged. \u201cSpeaking of different artists\u2014where is Tobias Dandridge?\u201d</p><p>Allison told him, \u201cOutside, to your right facing the house. It\u2019s a pretty little vault, too, but more like you\u2019d expect. It\u2019s a typical small mausoleum.\u201d</p><p>They went outside the Dandridge vault and followed a little pebbled path around the graveyard\u2019s various sections. Allison always found it sad to see the Colonial- and Victorian-era markers for children. So many died so young.</p><p>The Dandridge vault had a bronze plaque above it that trumpeted the family name. It was about the same size as the Tarleton vault, but the rows of etched markers outside announced many more names.</p><p>\u201cLots more Dandridges,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cWell, the Tarleton family name died out with Angus,\u201d Allison reminded him.</p><p>They didn\u2019t enter the tomb; here the gate and door were locked. There was nothing for tourists to see.</p><p>\u201cBack there. I\u2019ll show you where Robert the dog is buried,\u201d Allison told him.</p><p>There were a number of markers for pets. One of them, recently imbedded, was dedicated to Bibi the cat.</p><p>\u201cShe was here when I was a teenager,\u201d Allison said. \u201cThe guides fed her. Everyone loved her. And here, just a few feet away\u2014there\u2019s Robert.\u201d</p><p>A very handsome stone statue of a dog had been carved to sit atop the grave. The hound must have been close to two hundred pounds.</p><p>\u201cHe must have been something to wrestle with,\u201d Tyler commented.</p><p>\u201cI imagine that\u2019s why he was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he shot, stabbed\u2014taken down with a rifle butt or a bayonet?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You can read the memorial stone\u2014we have a group from the university that comes out to clean and repair these all the time. It says, \u2018Robert, a fine patriot who died in defense of his beloved mistress, Lucy Tarleton.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Tyler paused to read the memorial and then he looked up at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever feel Lucy out here, or any of the family? Anything, like even the brush of a cold nose against your fingers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said a little harshly. Had she ever felt such a thing? She wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>She\u2019d never believed in ghosts before. If she had felt something, she would\u2019ve thought that the chill of winter was coming on....</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she repeated, suddenly eager to leave the graveyard. \u201cWell, let\u2019s go back to the house. It is heading toward fall, you know. It\u2019s getting cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to my jacket,\u201d he said, starting to shed it.</p><p>\u201cThanks. But let\u2019s just go back.\u201d</p><p>She walked ahead of him, hurrying toward the house. As she neared it, she glanced up\u2014and nearly tripped.</p><p>She caught herself. And froze.</p><p>There was someone upstairs, looking out Lucy\u2019s window. Allison told herself that it might be Jane. Or maybe Kelsey had returned.</p><p>But she knew better; she\u2019d seen the image on screen.</p><p>It was frighteningly like looking in a mirror.</p><p>For a moment, it seemed as if Lucy Tarleton had defied the ages and stared down at her, sadness and yearning on her face.</p><p>And then she faded as if she\u2019d never been, and Allison wondered again what might be real to a sixth sense or on a different dimension, and what might be a trick of her tortured mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tyler asked her.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said. But as she entered the house, she felt something touch her fingers.</p><p>Like the cold, wet nose of a very large dog.</p><p>12</p><p>Tyler realized that Allison had hung back, but when he reached the foyer and the bank of screens again, she was right behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d he asked Sean.</p><p>\u201cLogan has gone off with Kelsey to continue searching through old records, and Kat\u2019s at the morgue. Jane is still working in the salon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going up to the attic,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI could be wrong. But I believe there\u2019s something in the research papers\u2014or maybe in papers that were stolen\u2014that may be the clue to all this.\u201d</p><p>Sean nodded.</p><p>Allison touched Tyler\u2019s arm. \u201cShould we go to the morgue first?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Tyler hesitated. \u201cCan you take it?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him with clear, level eyes. \u201cI can take anything, I think.\u201d</p><p>He raised his brows.</p><p>She shrugged with a half smile. \u201cA ghost, phantoms on a screen...what\u2019s one more ghost?\u201d she asked dryly.</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014if you\u2019re sure that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. I knew Sarah best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe autopsy is scheduled for tomorrow,\u201d Sean told them. \u201cLogan was hoping that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was hoping that Sarah remained behind,\u201d Allison said. \u201cRight? And that\u2019s the thing. She may speak to me where she wouldn\u2019t speak to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll go,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>To his surprise, Allison seemed calm and rational during their drive.</p><p>The morgue was a comprehensive and up-to-date facility. As they walked to the entry, he saw that she\u2019d turned a little pale.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you\u2019re all right to do this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She offered him a weak smile. \u201cI\u2019ve never been here. This is my city, and in all these years, I\u2019ve never been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot many people make a habit of hanging out at the medical examiner\u2019s offices,\u201d he said.</p><p>As they continued into the building, Tyler called Jane. She told him not to worry. Adam Harrison had greased the wheels and there\u2019d be no difficulty getting them in.</p><p>The medical pathologist who\u2019d been given Julian Mitchell\u2019s case was also on Sarah\u2019s; that had been arranged by Adam. Her name was Dr. Ana Grant, and she came with Kat to meet them in the vestibule. Slim with short graying hair and an easy manner, she spoke in a well-modulated voice that held empathy as well as professionalism. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDr. Grant has been very helpful,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>\u201cSarah Vining\u2019s body just arrived,\u201d Dr. Grant said after the introductions. \u201cI was showing your associate the snakebite marks when you called. We came out to escort you back\u2014I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s in a freezer room with other...guests. Her autopsy is scheduled for tomorrow morning, but her body has been cleaned in prep.\u201d</p><p>Tyler had been in many a morgue. He wanted to put a protective arm around Allison\u2019s shoulders, but held himself in check. She was still pale, but she didn\u2019t look as if she was about to pass out or collapse in horror. Of course, the outer offices of the medical examiner\u2019s office were neat and orderly in appearance.</p> <p>But as they entered the hallways, he thought he could detect the chemical odor that hinted of death and he kept a sharp eye on Allison.</p><p>She moved up next to him. \u201cDo people ever think you\u2019re mentally ill when you want to touch the dead?\u201d she asked him in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWe do it discreetly,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>A few minutes later they were staring down at Sarah Vining\u2019s body, covered with a sheet.</p><p>Sarah looked small, skinny and gray.</p> <p>\u201cThe bite mark is on the inner thigh just above the knee. She was driving when the snake panicked and struck her. I assume it had somehow gotten under the seat.\u201d</p><p>He watched as Dr. Grant showed them the bite marks but then he looked at Allison. She was almost as gray as Sarah Vining.</p><p>She stepped forward, saying softly, \u201cShe was a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Dr. Grant said.</p><p>Allison touched Sarah\u2019s hair. Tyler thought she\u2019d step back quickly, but she didn\u2019t. She stayed there, gently touching the dead woman and gazing down at her.</p><p>Dr. Grant spoke quietly to Kat and Tyler. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll find anything we don\u2019t see here when the autopsy is performed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll know better what organs gave out when, but I have an educated hunch that between the bite and the trauma of the accident, her heart failed her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever heard of such a thing before?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cPeople dying after a bite like that?\u201d Dr. Grant shrugged. \u201cCopperheads are dangerous and can be vicious when they\u2019re threatened. But we do have antidotes for the bites, and these days most people survive. But elderly people, small children, those who are ill when they\u2019re bitten\u2014they\u2019re in the greatest danger. The heart can fail under stress and trauma. That\u2019s what I believe happened to Sarah. And in the midst of that massive accident, I\u2019m sure no one expected her real problem to be a snakebite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Tyler said, glancing from Dr. Grant to Kat.</p><p>Allison hadn\u2019t been listening. He saw that she was staring down at Sarah Vining, her fingers still resting lightly on her hair.</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.</p><p>Kat stayed behind; there was evidently more of a medical nature that she wanted to discuss with Dr. Grant.</p><p>Tyler led Allison out. \u201cAnything?\u201d he asked her as they reached the car.</p> <p>\u201cSorrow and confusion,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI can only imagine how you feel,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. Yes, I mean, of course, my heart bleeds for both Julian and Sarah. They were murdered, their lives were stolen from them. That\u2019s what I got from Sarah. She doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019s dead. She doesn\u2019t understand. She doesn\u2019t remember anything except for a sudden and excruciating pain\u2014and then the air bag blowing up in her face. She remembers stumbling out and being thrown several feet while the world seemed to explode around her in horrible screeches and bangs while the other cars crashed into one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she is there?\u201d he asked incredulously. He grimaced. \u201cYou felt her\u2014heard her\u2014and neither Kat nor I did?\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cI felt as if her eyes opened and she looked at me. And it was as if I could hear her.\u201d She was quiet for a minute. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t mind that she\u2019s dead. She said she has incredible faith and she\u2019s...she\u2019s waiting to go. Oh, and she wants to be buried or entombed at the house. Do you think our friend Adam has the clout to arrange that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, climbing into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cBut,\u201d he added as she joined him, \u201cAdam does seem to have the power to make the earth move\u2014no pun intended. I\u2019m sure he can do something.\u201d He put the car into reverse and turned to drive out of the lot before he spoke to her again. \u201cYou\u2019re okay?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. I came because I\u2019m the \u2018key,\u2019\u201d she told him with a self-conscious shrug. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve been frightened out of my mind. But that all started the moment I saw Julian dead in the study. It got worse when I saw him as a ghost. And then Lucy. And then the whole thing with Mr. Dixon... But I\u2019m tired of being terrified. I want to get to the end of this, no matter what it is. I don\u2019t want anyone else dying, and I don\u2019t understand why Julian and Sarah are dead. And why a man who visited the house is in a coma. Whatever is going on, right now I feel like saying \u2018come and do your worst\u2019 because I\u2019m...ready to fight back.\u201d She turned to look at him with an awkward smile.</p><p>He nodded slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing to go through life frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just... I don\u2019t get it. I really didn\u2019t believe in ghosts. I actually think I wanted to believe in ghosts, because then I\u2019d know there was something beyond this life. But...why now?\u201d</p><p>She twisted in her seat to face him as he drove. \u201cWhat about you? Supposedly, if you\u2019re going to have second sight, you\u2019re born with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. My first reaction was like yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrank,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I told you before.\u201d She gave him a frown and he laughed softly, then launched into his story about finding the younger sister of the dead heroin dealer in Texas, the woman whose ghost had appeared repeatedly to him. \u201cAfter that,\u201d he concluded, \u201cit seemed as if a door had opened. And I worked with Logan, who\u2019s one of those people who saw things at an early age, but he has Native American blood and I often think Native Americans have a far greater understanding that the world is more than what we see. But even Logan was always careful. Maybe this second sight or extra sense comes to people when it\u2019s necessary. We\u2014and by we I mean our Krewes\u2014don\u2019t have any real answers and we don\u2019t pretend to. We\u2019ve just learned that the dead may be out there\u2014and that they have reasons for their presence and they may be able to help.\u201d</p><p>He was surprised to see a smile curving her lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so amusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith my new power, maybe I can summon all the old statesmen and leaders and wives I\u2019ve wanted to meet. Dolley Madison must have been an incredible woman. And how I\u2019d love to meet Lincoln\u2014and Robert E. Lee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish it worked that way,\u201d he told her. \u201cMost of the time, people do move on. Good thing, or the streets would be so crowded with specters that none of us would be able to take a step.\u201d She laughed, but he grew serious as he said, \u201cI think that when a soul is finally at peace, it does move on.\u201d</p><p>She seemed more comfortable with him than she\u2019d ever been. And she seemed stronger. He knew he\u2019d met her at a time of crisis in her life\u2014but that she had an inner strength and real courage.</p><p>\u201cAnother favorite historical heroine of mine has always been Lucy Tarleton,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we know she\u2019s stayed behind. We\u2019ve seen her on the screens, walking around the house in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to coax her out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t she just come to us and say, Listen, here\u2019s the way it really was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have all the answers, I told you that. Certain spirits will talk to certain people. Some never learn how to be seen and heard.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him, then sobered. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be smiling. Two colleagues are dead\u2014and speaking to me. But the reality is they\u2019re dead. And that fact is still devastating.\u201d</p><p>He reached over to squeeze her hand, once again wondering, as he touched her, if she\u2019d draw away. But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>They returned to the Tarleton-Dandridge House. Sean had left; Logan was in his place, with Kelsey at his side.</p><p>\u201cAnything?\u201d Logan and Tyler said at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer first,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe found records with birth and death dates, family trees\u2014nothing we didn\u2019t know. But it\u2019s good to investigate, to make sure we\u2019re not assuming something is obvious, only to find out we\u2019re wrong. What about the morgue?\u201d</p><p>Tyler was surprised when Allison gave a full report on her exchange with Sarah Vining.</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cSo she didn\u2019t know anything at all\u2014except that she was suddenly in pain and then staggering out in a melee of cars colliding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. She doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019s dead. All she knows is that she is. And she\u2019s oddly at peace with it,\u201d Allison told him.</p><p>\u201cSome people just are,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe\u2019re on earth for only so long, and I believe that peace comes to some people when they\u2019ve died.\u201d He was thoughtful for a moment. \u201cBut Sarah\u2019s still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe because she\u2019s part of this...whatever it is,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Logan agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s really late, you two. There are sandwiches in the pantry, sodas, beer, some wine... Coffee, too, but I\u2019m not suggesting that now. It\u2019s about time to get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Allison turned to Tyler. \u201cYou wanted to look through papers in the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can wait until morning,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go back now. We\u2019ve gotten started. Let\u2019s give it an hour.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Allison had undergone a complete change, he realized. He smiled. \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day.\u201d</p><p>She obviously wasn\u2019t impressed with his clich\u00e9. \u201cBut two friends have died in a matter of days,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ll grab a sandwich and head on up.\u201d</p> <p>Thirty minutes later they were back in the attic. Allison made piles, gathering financial papers to put with financial papers, bookings for private events with bookings for other private events, and research materials with other research materials. He offered to help her but she suggested he read; she knew what she was doing.</p><p>He came across a number of articles on the people of Philadelphia at the time of the Revolution and found himself fascinated by these snippets of history. He\u2019d assumed that, with the exception of the Civil War, their own era was the most contentious in American history, but now he recognized that the founding fathers hadn\u2019t had an easy task. Nor had the patriots and their families. There were cases in which sons were determined on the Revolution while their fathers were adamant that they pack up for Canada\u2014the British colonies\u2014\u201cuntil the foolish fighting and dying was over.\u201d There were sad human-interest pieces on daughters who\u2019d married into patriot or Loyalist families when their parents were on the opposite side.</p><p>As he read through newspaper, magazine and other articles printed from online sites, he noticed that Allison had finished gathering most of the paperwork together but seemed troubled. She looked at him.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He was seated on the floor, back against the wall, his pile of research materials before him. She indicated the pile. \u201cOf course,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking about a certain article. It was written by a man who\u2019d been a high school history teacher in Maryland and then moved to Valley Forge and had his own tour company. He knows quite a lot about generals, including Washington, and even the enlisted men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking at it the other night,\u201d Tyler said, producing the article he\u2019d been reading about Beast Bradley just before he\u2019d made Julian\u2019s acquaintance and the others had arrived. \u201cIt\u2019s by Martin Standish. Is this it? \u2018Brian Bradley was born to Lord and Lady Bradley in Yorkshire, England, in 1750. His family could easily trace their lineage to the Royal House of Hanover\u2014literally, he was born with a silver spoon ready for his mouth.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014I mean, no,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was the first of two articles he wrote. I\u2019d been planning to drive down to see him. He\u2019s a brilliant man. The first article focused on Bradley. He wrote another on Lucy and her patriot lover, Stewart Douglas\u2014and that\u2019s gone missing. I remember that he focused on the Tarleton family and their social situation and standing as the crises came to a head. It\u2019s assumed that both Bradley and Douglas were killed during the war\u2014but there\u2019s no proof. They were presumed dead. Neither of them appeared to claim their property afterward, and because of who he was, it was assumed that perhaps Bradley\u2019s own men did him in and that\u2019s why there\u2019s no record of it. And of course hundreds of men died on battlefields and were never identified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see that second article,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cCan\u2019t you just bring it back up online?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would someone take it?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. He quotes from letters he has in his own possession and they make her patriot lover sound like a bit of an ass. Maybe that\u2019s what someone didn\u2019t want anyone taking seriously?\u201d Allison suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not even buried here, is he? Stewart Douglas, I mean. Do you speak about him on the tours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes. We would\u2019ve spoken about him a lot more if he was buried here, but he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he supposed to have killed Beast Bradley in retaliation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know. I guess that\u2019s one theory. All we know is that neither of them came home after the Revolution\u2014to Philadelphia or England\u2014so the assumption is that they were both buried in a mass grave at some battlefield. Although historians know what happened to a lot of rank-and-file soldiers. Those two just seem to have disappeared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken with this fellow\u2014Martin Standish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve emailed him a few times. He appreciates my interest\u2014he thinks it\u2019s great that people at the house aren\u2019t just ignoring him. I guess he tried to make contact years before and he was shut out. I can call him.\u201d She gave him a puzzled look. \u201cDo you think he can help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Tyler stood, yawning. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got to call it quits. That means you have to call it quits. The rest of the house has called it quits.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can keep going\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want you across the hall. I want to jump out of bed like a lightning bolt if I hear the slightest sound coming from your room.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI am tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we definitely call it quits. No one\u2019ll be coming up here until we come back. No one can get in the house without us knowing it. No one\u2014dead or alive\u2014can move around downstairs without appearing on one of Sean\u2019s screens. Bed,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>She lowered her head for a moment and then nodded. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn out the attic lights; he wanted anything that happened up there clearly visible on the screens.</p><p>They went downstairs to the second floor.</p><p>Julian\u2014or Julian\u2019s spirit\u2014was slumped against the wall by Allison\u2019s room. For a ghost, he seemed to need his sleep.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d Allison whispered to Tyler.</p><p>\u201cGood night,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave the door cracked. If anything happens, scream like a banshee. I\u2019ll be right with you.\u201d</p><p>Men were supposed to have the minds that resided in gutters, Allison told herself.</p><p>But when Tyler had said that one word\u2014bed\u2014her mind had immediately leaped to other thoughts.</p><p>As she lay down to sleep, she realized that her opinion of him had changed drastically. When they first met, she\u2019d considered him a tall, good-looking shyster who was going to turn this house into a gawker\u2019s showcase. She\u2019d imagined ridiculous lights and people caught in them with wide, reflecting eyes while they shouted, \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d or, \u201cYes, there\u2019s a ghost here, I can feel it....\u201d</p><p>But she knew differently now.</p><p>Now, he was tall and good-looking and exceedingly...</p><p>Attractive. Sensual. Yes, the word bed had made her think of quite another way that a bed could be used.</p><p>She had to stop thinking like that. He was with five other agents. He was kind and protective and sincere in his efforts to help her\u2014and be helped by her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t an object of attraction or sexual interest to him.</p><p>She was a key.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t stop remembering the way it felt when he touched her. His hand on hers, electricity shooting through her. There was something about him....</p><p>The machismo of a Texan, a cowboy.</p><p>Except he wasn\u2019t like that. Well, he was a Texan, but he didn\u2019t seem to think a man had his place and a woman had hers. He was just strong by nature\u2014and he was there whenever she felt confused or vulnerable.</p><p>Transference. That was it. He was her rock through all of this. She wasn\u2019t really attracted; she was just leaning on him. That wasn\u2019t true. Yes, it was. She was leaning on him.</p><p>But she liked him. And she hadn\u2019t trusted herself since she\u2019d ended it with Peter Aubrey. She\u2019d understood that Peter had loved her, but he was an addict and he wasn\u2019t going to change for her or for himself. What she\u2019d done was right, and she could only hope that Peter would live long enough to find his way.</p><p>So, yes, this stirring was fantastic. This longing, this...</p><p>Bed.</p><p>She found herself imagining him naked. His body was long, sleek and hard\u2014she knew that. He was probably beautiful when he was naked.</p><p>She groaned, tossing in bed. This was ridiculous. She\u2019d been better off when she\u2019d considered him a ghost-busting sexist.</p><p>She had to sleep. She had to stop her mind from going in this direction. She had to remember that Sarah Vining was dead. Dead. Someone was killing people, and they were here to figure out why.</p><p>She closed her eyes and prayed for sleep.</p><p>Eventually, it came.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dream in the night; she awoke suddenly. When she did, she saw someone at the foot of the bed.</p><p>She would have screamed except that the scream died in her throat, and while she was gasping for breath, she saw that it was the woman who\u2019d appeared on Sean\u2019s footage the night before.</p><p>Lucy Tarleton.</p><p>A woman she resembled to an uncanny degree.</p><p>Fear nearly strangled her.</p><p>The ghost of a friend slept outside her door, and she had spoken to the corpse of another that afternoon. There was no reason to feel such terror at this point, especially since she was certain the woman had not come to hurt her.</p><p>Lucy raised a finger to her lips. She looked around as if afraid she\u2019d be seen. She walked out of the room, then returned, hovering by the doorframe and beckoning to Allison.</p><p>Again, as it had earlier that day, Allison\u2019s terror receded.</p><p>She reminded herself of what she\u2019d determined earlier\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to live in fear. Whatever this was, she was seeing it through.</p><p>She rose from her bed, letting the spirit know that she meant to follow. As she trailed behind Lucy, the ghost began moving more swiftly. Allison was halfway down the stairs before she heard Tyler calling her.</p><p>She paused but didn\u2019t stop. Tyler would follow her; she didn\u2019t want to lose the ghost.</p><p>Lucy swept down the stairs and turned into the central hallway, heading for the door. When Allison reached it, Tyler was right behind her.</p><p>\u201cAllison!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lucy. She just went through the door,\u201d Allison explained. \u201cI have to get out there. I have to see where she\u2019s leading me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tyler didn\u2019t question her. He keyed in the number on the alarm and opened the door.</p><p>They both stepped out.</p><p>Lucy was mounting Firewalker, the great black horse. The dog, Robert, was barking and running around excitedly. Firewalker reared up, and Lucy spoke affectionately to the dog, ordering him back to the house.</p> <p>The dog obeyed, but stood by the house barking.</p><p>Then Lucy leaned forward, speaking to the horse and nudging him with her heels.</p><p>The horse broke into a canter.</p><p>And Firewalker and Lucy raced into the night.</p><p>Allison felt Tyler\u2019s hands on her shoulders. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d Allison asked. It was chilly outside; she was dressed in a blue flannel nightshirt. Behind her, Tyler wore nothing but pajama pants. He had to be cold, but it seemed that he came closer to warm her. She felt the length of his body.</p><p>It was distracting.</p><p>Even more distracting than a ghost who\u2019d come to her bedroom and lured her down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you see her? How did you see her?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cI woke up. She was at the foot of my bed. She wanted me to follow her,\u201d Allison said.</p> <p>What she wanted was to lean back in his arms. She wanted to trust him. She wanted to forget everything that was going on and even herself\u2014to relish the feel of him and forget the world and indulge in nothing but sexual passion and pure carnal pleasure.</p><p>She heard him swallow behind her. He stepped back.</p><p>Had he been thinking along the same lines?</p><p>\u201cShe wanted you to follow her, and she came out here\u2014and mounted her horse and rode away,\u201d he mused. \u201cShe still wants you to follow,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>Allison struggled to keep her thoughts where they should be.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have a ghost horse\u2014or any horse\u2014of my own, and if I did...I don\u2019t know how to ride.\u201d</p><p>She turned and saw that he was smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhere did she go when she left here?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou know where she went\u2014she carried secrets to the patriots at Valley Forge.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd where is that writer you\u2019ve been emailing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValley Forge,\u201d she said, frowning.</p><p>\u201cLucy wants you to go to Valley Forge,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Logan had come down. He was wearing a robe\u2014and he was armed and ready.</p><p>Tyler quickly explained. Logan nodded. \u201cSounds like a field trip to me. But it\u2019s three in the morning. I think you should wait until a normal hour and then go. That is, Allison, if the writer\u2019s willing to see you. If he\u2019s there. You don\u2019t know, do you, if the man still lives in Valley Forge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe communicated not long ago. I don\u2019t think he leaves that often, although he does participate in battle reenactments,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cCall him around nine,\u201d Tyler suggested. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s agreeable, we\u2019ll see him tomorrow. And even if he\u2019s not...Lucy wants you to follow her. She rode to Valley Forge. That\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe two of you can leave tomorrow. Jane can continue working with the likenesses and Kat will attend the autopsy. We\u2019ll keep working the records from this angle, and Sean can monitor the house to see what goes on here in your absence. That is, if you\u2019re willing to do all this, Allison?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>Road trip! Alone with Tyler.</p><p>Not a good idea. But necessary.</p><p>She felt strangely weak and strong at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d Tyler prompted her.</p><p>She had to force herself not to smile. There was nothing to smile about. Two people were dead. They were just going on a research mission.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said primly. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the household\u2014including Julian, who managed to look sleepy even though he was a ghost\u2014had come outside.</p><p>Allison noticed that all the other Krewe members were armed. Everyone moved back into the house and gathered in the entry around the screens.</p><p>\u201cAlly?\u201d Julian sounded concerned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you move!\u201d Julian said. \u201cAm I supposed to sleep like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you love to sleep when you were alive?\u201d Kelsey asked him. \u201cDid you keep late hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I was always burning the candle at both ends,\u201d he said apologetically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really. I followed Lucy of my own accord, and I ran the way I did because I didn\u2019t want her to disappear,\u201d Allison explained.</p><p>\u201cStill, you should have gotten me first,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cYou were right behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you shouldn\u2019t take off without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring your gun,\u201d Allison pointed out.</p><p>She thought he flushed slightly at that; he should have been armed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you should get me instead of making me bolt out to catch up with you,\u201d Tyler grumbled.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that none of us go off on our own from now on,\u201d Logan said firmly.</p><p>Jane yawned. \u201cI could use some more sleep. Okay if I go back to bed?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cGo on up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see what we caught on our digital film,\u201d Sean said, walking over to take his seat by the screens.</p><p>He hit some keys on the computer keyboard, and they saw the film in reverse. Seconds later, it moved forward.</p><p>Lucy appeared at the foot of the stairs as she had before. Then she looked into Angus Tarleton\u2019s study.</p><p>She left the study and hurried up the stairs, where she entered Allison\u2019s room.</p><p>She reappeared a moment later.</p><p>And then they saw Allison running out and, within a split second, Tyler bursting out of his room to follow her.</p><p>\u201cYou do have good hearing,\u201d Allison murmured.</p><p>They watched as Lucy, followed by Allison and Tyler, raced to the back door.</p><p>Sean reset the cameras. \u201cThe resemblance is really uncanny,\u201d he commented.</p><p>Allison sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not a Tarleton or a Dandridge. My records prove it. I wasn\u2019t adopted. In fact, my mom had me at the same hospital where Artie Dixon is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d Tyler said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cYou thinking what I\u2019m thinking?\u201d Logan asked him.</p><p>Tyler nodded, studying Allison.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t adopted,\u201d she said, shaking her head. She wasn\u2019t angry, just amused. They were so determined to find a reason for the resemblance.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cYou weren\u2019t adopted. But I\u2019m willing to bet someone in your family was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll look for any possibility when we study the records while you\u2019re gone,\u201d Logan told them.</p><p>\u201cAdoption is wonderful, but I know that neither of my parents was adopted, either. One of my best friends in school was, and my dad used to tell her how fortunate she was that her parents had chosen her and loved her so much,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about your parents,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking further back. Much further back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Allison asked him.</p><p>\u201cI mean back to Lucy Tarleton.\u201d</p><p>13</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go to Valley Forge today,\u201d Kelsey told Tyler the next morning as he walked into the pantry to pour a cup of coffee after he\u2019d showered and dressed.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we have an invitation,\u201d Kelsey told him.</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to understand why you\u2019ve forgotten,\u201d Kelsey said with a wry grin. \u201cCherry Addison. Remember, yesterday, before all hell broke loose? She invited us to her husband\u2019s showing. You could go to Valley Forge and we could go to the show, but I believe all our suspects will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValley Forge is only about twenty miles north of the city,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cIt\u2019s a day trip for a lot of people visiting Philly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what if you do find something there?\u201d</p><p>Tyler frowned. He wanted to get to Valley Forge, but seeing all the suspects in one place at one time was too good an opportunity to miss.</p><p>\u201cAre they still having the show?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cSarah Vining died yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough to stop this, with the gallery set up and all the invitations sent out. Even if it conflicted with a funeral, which it won\u2019t, I\u2019m not sure the Addisons would have stopped it,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cAnd at Kat\u2019s request, they\u2019re holding Julian\u2019s and Sarah\u2019s bodies for at least a few days, so...\u201d</p><p>Kelsey handed Tyler a cup of coffee. \u201cYour call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is the showing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called Mrs. Addison this morning. Cocktails and hors d\u2019oeuvres at six. Her husband, George, the artist, will be there, of course, to meet with his adoring fans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand he\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. Kat\u2019s going back to the morgue, right?\u201d</p><p>Kelsey nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch the house with Jane and Sean. Jane\u2019s still working, but you\u2019ll want to see the images she\u2019s come up with so far. I\u2019ve spelled Sean a few times. He\u2019s equally convinced we\u2019ve got to pay attention to the cameras\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do,\u201d Tyler interrupted.</p><p>\u201cLogan is going to the records office to see what he can discover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI\u2019m heading down to the police station to talk to Jenson. When Allison wakes up, will you tell her what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Anything else you want her to know or do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, ask her to print out the missing article\u2014she believes she can find it online,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd ask her to call Martin Standish and see if we can set something up for tomorrow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay. See you later, then.\u201d</p><p>Jenson wasn\u2019t the officer investigating the accident that had injured two dozen people\u2014several still in critical condition\u2014and killed Sarah, but he offered any help Tyler and his Krewe might need. He also asked for an update on anything they\u2019d discovered.</p><p>\u201cWe believe, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the death of Julian Mitchell was engineered. But we don\u2019t know why someone was rummaging through the attic, or if the same person tore apart the attic and killed Mr. Mitchell,\u201d Tyler explained. \u201cWe also believe yesterday\u2019s accident was maliciously planned with the intent to kill Sarah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard there was a snake in Ms. Vining\u2019s car,\u201d Jenson said. \u201cThat\u2019s a far-fetched way to commit murder. The snake might just have crawled into the vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did a snake happen to crawl into her car?\u201d Tyler asked in turn.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat snake was planted there,\u201d Tyler insisted. \u201cOh, has anyone found it yet?\u201d</p><p>Jenson shook his head. \u201cNo one was looking for a snake. The car was towed to the impound. Of course, as soon as the PPD heard about the snakebite, we warned the men and women working the car to be careful and on the lookout for a snake. Thing is, that snake might be long gone by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr it might still be hiding in the car,\u201d Tyler warned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. I don\u2019t think the vehicular people have examined the car yet. I\u2019ll make a call as soon as we\u2019re through.\u201d He paused, his expression puzzled. \u201cThe real question is, why would anyone risk the lives of that many people to kill one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make it look like an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t buy it,\u201d Jenson told him, clearly not won over. \u201cAre we talking about insanity here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far, Sarah\u2019s is the only death, but a few others are critical,\u201d Tyler reminded him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not suggesting that whoever\u2019s doing this is insane. I just think the agenda this person has precludes caring about any collateral damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do at my end?\u201d Jenson asked. \u201cIf we find the creature\u2014well, it\u2019s unlikely a snake is going to talk.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler was surprised; Jenson did seem to have a sense of wry humor.</p><p>\u201cNo, but what you can do is check to see if any have been sold lately. Our murderer might have purchased the snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgent Montague, this is Philadelphia. We\u2019ve sent out an alert, but I doubt we\u2019ll get anything. Copperheads are easy to find in the woods that surround the city,\u201d Jenson said. \u201cThey show up in basements and garages. We\u2019ve also contacted Philadelphia\u2019s animal control, but they haven\u2019t had anyone call to ask for a copperhead. But you\u2019re right. We\u2019ll follow every angle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever is doing this is extremely clever. These murders have taken calculation and planning and they\u2019ve required a certain level of risk.\u201d</p><p>Jenson hesitated. \u201cYou\u2019re sure they\u2019re all murders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive Sarah\u2019s is. And there\u2019s evidence of a blow on Julian Mitchell\u2019s head. That proves someone shoved him down on that bayonet. So, yes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Jenson still didn\u2019t seem convinced, but he wasn\u2019t argumentative. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave your men keep an eye on Ethan Oxford, Nathan Pierson, Cherry Addison, Jason Lawrence and Annette Fanning,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a tall order and a lot of manpower. This is a big city. We have our share of crime, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can\u2019t have your officers tracking them every minute of every day. Ask them to keep an eye out for suspicious activity,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cDrive by their houses, check to see that they are where they\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ms. Leigh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was with us at the house yesterday, both before and during the accident,\u201d Tyler told him. \u201cThree of the board members were there shortly before the accident, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll take a closer look at the board members.\u201d Jenson lifted his hands. \u201cThey\u2019re dedicated to that place. Why would any of them want to commit murders\u2014bizarre murders that are bound to cast a bad light on the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we can figure out why, we\u2019ll know who,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m going to see whether we can find out if one of them has taken a nice walk in the woods lately. I don\u2019t believe our killer purchased the snake. And if they find the creature, maybe an expert can tell us more about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work that angle, too, but since you\u2019re local, you\u2019re in a better position to pursue it,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>As he was about to leave, Jenson\u2019s phone rang. He raised one hand, asking Tyler to wait.</p><p>Then he hung up. \u201cThey\u2019ve found your snake.\u201d</p><p>There was something about Adam Harrison that drew people to him.</p><p>After taking a cold shower\u2014the hot water supply had run out\u2014and getting dressed, Allison was surprised to see Adam at the house, seated in their little enclave around Sean\u2019s computer.</p><p>She\u2019d sensed that he usually put one of his Krewes on a case and withdrew himself.</p><p>But when she arrived downstairs, he was there, together with Logan and Sean. When he saw her, he quickly rose.</p><p>\u201cMy dear,\u201d he said, coming toward her. He took both of her hands. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see you looking so much better. I\u2019m delighted, as well, that you\u2019ve chosen to assist my unit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m delighted that your unit is anxious to save my life,\u201d she said, meaning it.</p><p>\u201cNaturally, our purpose is to save the lives of all we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here,\u201d she said. \u201cIs that usual?\u201d She smiled. \u201cFrom what I understand, you\u2019re all over the country, involved with law enforcement...and philanthropy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, Ethan and I go way back. He\u2019s an old friend. Actually, he was my son Josh\u2019s godfather. I felt this was a situation I should be here for, just in case I was needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to see you again,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ll be leaving soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Kelsey said, sweeping into the room with a cup of coffee for her.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe trip to Valley Forge is postponed, because of the art showing tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd \u2018all the king\u2019s men\u2019 will be there,\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Allison tried not to show her disappointment.</p><p>She\u2019d looked forward to spending the day with Tyler, hoping for more\u2014much more\u2014than they\u2019d experienced so far. Even if it couldn\u2019t last...</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime Tyler has a couple of requests,\u201d Logan told her. \u201cHe\u2019s asked that you contact Mr. Standish and see if you can arrange an appointment for tomorrow. And would you look for that article online? The one that seems to be missing from the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Tyler isn\u2019t here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s checking in with the police.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that one of the resident ghosts is trying to reach you.\u201d Adam spoke in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cI believe I\u2019m a resident ghost now, and I\u2019ve reached her just fine!\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t heard or seen Julian until he suddenly spoke behind her. She jumped, and Adam frowned. She realized he couldn\u2019t see the ghost.</p><p>\u201cAnother resident ghost,\u201d Kelsey said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe have someone present?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cJulian Mitchell, my friend who was killed here,\u201d Allison replied.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Adam wasn\u2019t sure where to look, but he ventured a question. \u201cMr. Mitchell, have you been able to contact any of your fellow ghosts in this house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I\u2019ve seen the ghost of Lucy Tarleton just like you\u2019ve seen her\u2014a wraith running away,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>Allison repeated his words.</p><p>Adam turned thoughtfully to Logan and then to Allison. \u201cMy Krewes have seen so much and learned so much, and there\u2019s still an infinite number of things we don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s impressive, I think, that Mr. Mitchell has so readily appeared to you. Was he an outgoing man in life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPainfully,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Julian protested.</p><p>\u201cHe was a performer,\u201d Allison said, feeling guilty about her earlier comment. \u201cA very good performer,\u201d she added.</p><p>Adam nodded. \u201cLucy Tarleton has been in this house for over two hundred years now. When she was alive, she was secretive by necessity. You may have to draw her out, and pay careful attention to every appearance she makes.\u201d He smiled sadly. \u201cI just see one soul here on earth\u2014my son, Josh. It took a very long time, and then one day...one day he broke through to me. He is still the only soul I\u2019m able to communicate with, but I ask nothing else. It\u2019s through you, those who do have the gift, that I can try to help others. It\u2019s a remarkable world when you have a greater vision,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAdam, we believe Lucy is saying something. And Allison will figure out what it is,\u201d Logan assured him.</p><p>\u201cRight now,\u201d Allison said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the office to pull up that article and I\u2019ll call Martin Standish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Kelsey told her. When Allison looked at her sharply, Kelsey shrugged. \u201cWe need to take every precaution.\u201d</p><p>Adam had already turned to speak with Logan and Sean as Kelsey and Allison started up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThe shower must\u2019ve been freezing,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should have warned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helped me wake up.\u201d Allison laughed, and Kelsey joined in. The more she was with members of the Krewe, the more Allison liked them. They were like a family, trusting in one another and all working together at whatever task they were assigned. Of course, Kelsey and Sean were family, and Kelsey and Logan were a couple. The others had all known one another in Texas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was glad of Kelsey\u2019s company.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not heading to Valley Forge today,\u201d Allison said as they reached the attic office, \u201cI\u2019d like to stop by my place for a few more things, if someone can come with me. And, maybe, a long, hot shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk over with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Allison sat down at the computer and keyed in a search for Martin Standish articles. She found the second one he\u2019d written on Lord Brian \u201cBeast\u201d Bradley and printed it out. Then she called Martin, but had to leave a message.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to wait for him to call back,\u201d she said.</p><p>But even as she spoke, her phone rang. She was surprised that Martin Standish had called her right back\u2014and that he was angry. \u201cAllison Leigh, from the Tarleton-Dandridge House!\u201d he spat out. \u201cIf you\u2019re calling to tell me you plan to embarrass me with some kind of news story or sue me for slander, you\u2019re full of it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Allison said, stunned. \u201cNo, no, Mr. Standish, we\u2019ve only corresponded on email. Do you remember? I admire your research very much. I\u2019m eager to see you and learn more about the letters and information you have.\u201d</p><p>There was a distrustful silence on the other end. Then he asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t call me and threaten me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever! I swear it,\u201d Allison said. Kelsey was looking at her, perplexed.</p><p>\u201cMr. Standish, I take it that someone did call and threaten you, but it wasn\u2019t me. When did this happen? Do you know who it was?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>Kelsey was watching her, trying to hear both ends of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt was a woman. I thought she was you,\u201d Standish muttered. \u201cShe said she was with the Tarleton-Dandridge House and she was appalled by the traitorous slant I was putting on the patriots of the house. And if I didn\u2019t stop, she\u2019d see that I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Standish, I\u2019m sorry. I guarantee that call didn\u2019t come from anyone with the right to make it or to say such things. You and I have corresponded, and you know I\u2019m intrigued by your information and theories. Actually, I was calling because I was hoping you\u2019d take a few minutes to see me tomorrow,\u201d Allison said. \u201cYou have to believe me. That was no official stance taken by anyone at the Tarleton-Dandridge House.\u201d</p><p>He sniffed over the line. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think it was you\u2014not based on our email correspondence. I hear you\u2019re having all kinds of trouble there. A guide killed himself on a bayonet like an idiot, and one of your board members died in that awful accident yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need your help, Mr. Standish,\u201d Allison said simply.</p><p>\u201cEverything I\u2019ve written is online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but your letters aren\u2019t. And I\u2019d like to see the other objects in your collection.\u201d</p><p>He was silent a minute. \u201cAll right. Two o\u2019clock. I\u2019ll give you the address to my shop and my little museum,\u201d he told her. \u201cBe on time, or forget it.\u201d</p><p>Once she\u2019d hung up, Allison repeated the conversation to Kelsey.</p><p>\u201cHe said it was a woman who called?\u201d Kelsey asked.</p><p>Allison nodded.</p><p>\u201cSarah Vining is dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. That leaves Cherry Addison,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cOr Annette Fanning,\u201d Kelsey reminded her. But she didn\u2019t press it.</p><p>Officer Alfred Crosbie from animal control had the snake in a terrarium.</p><p>A big terrarium.</p><p>It was a big snake.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say we\u2019ll have to kill the creature and do a necropsy if we\u2019re going to tell you anything about it. Not that I can tell you much\u2014just what kind of food it\u2019s eaten, such as wild catches or pet-store-bred mice or rats. I do believe, however, that we\u2019re looking at a copperhead someone managed to catch in the wild,\u201d Crosbie told Tyler. \u201cSee, look at the snake closely. The skin\u2019s a little rough. An animal kept for research or as a pet\u2014don\u2019t know anyone who keeps a pet copperhead, but some people are crazy\u2014wouldn\u2019t be as beat-up as this.\u201d</p><p>Crosbie looked mournful at the idea of killing any creature. But by now, the police had concluded that there was something suspicious about the snake being in the car.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d Tyler asked him.</p><p>\u201cCoiled tight under the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Crosbie said. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t get out and slither away in all the commotion. But a snake has instincts, and he just hid. That\u2019s what creatures do. Shame to kill this one, but I\u2019ll let you know as soon as our vet gets the necropsy done.\u201d</p><p>Tyler thanked him. As he left the impound area, he started back toward the house but then paused.</p><p>He made his way to Ethan\u2019s grand old mansion. Oxford\u2019s housekeeper showed him into the study and he waited there for Ethan to arrive.</p><p>The older man wore a casual sweater, apologizing for his appearance. \u201cForgive me. I\u2019ve been on the phone. I\u2019m devastated by Sarah\u2019s death and, I\u2019m afraid, she had no family. She asked me ages ago to be the executor of her will. Her body\u2019s still at the morgue, but I\u2019ve been receiving calls about the legal status of her property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Mr. Oxford. And actually, Sarah\u2019s death is why I\u2019m here to see you.\u201d</p><p>He sat down at his desk, suddenly looking very old and confused.</p><p>\u201cSarah died in an accident,\u201d he said. \u201cShe nearly killed dozens of people. I can\u2019t begin to imagine what happened to her.\u201d</p><p>The hospital had not released the results of Sarah\u2019s death. For once, it seemed, there\u2019d been no leaks.</p><p>\u201cSarah caused the accident and died because of a snakebite,\u201d Tyler explained. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll ask you not to share that information.\u201d</p><p>Oxford looked even more confused. \u201cA snakebite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. There was a copperhead in her car. And we believe it was put there intentionally.\u201d</p><p>Oxford stared at him as if he were speaking another language.</p><p>\u201cYou and the board members are friends, obviously, since you\u2019re handling Sarah\u2019s estate,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Oxford nodded, waving a hand in the air. \u201cWe have many similar interests. We all love the house and Philly and...art, music and so on.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhen I agreed to be Sarah\u2019s executor, I never figured I\u2019d outlive her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of your fellow board members?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>Oxford was offended. \u201cI think they\u2019re fine human beings! I know I\u2019m the one who asked Adam Harrison to bring in a team, but you\u2019re way off base if you believe any member of the board might have anything to do with this. I\u2019ve known them for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re all fine, upstanding citizens of Philadelphia, ardent supporters of the history of the city and the city itself,\u201d Tyler said mildly.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ethan exclaimed. \u201cThere was a tour going just before Julian Mitchell was found dead. You need to be looking at outside sources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. But outside sources don\u2019t know the house the way your board members and guides do. If you\u2019re right, you can help me clear those people, and then maybe we\u2019ll find another direction to go in.\u201d There was no other direction; he knew that. Oxford didn\u2019t.</p><p>Ethan let out a long sigh. \u201cWhat did you want to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you can tell me about the board\u2019s activity in the past few weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActivity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Such as, has anyone been on a hunting or hiking trip out in the woods? Has anyone become involved with a magic shop or illusions of any kind?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s face seemed to grow red as Tyler spoke.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cactually, someone has been on a hiking trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Oxford told him.</p><p>Kelsey tended to be soft-spoken, but Allison was pretty sure she had a strong, tough edge, since she\u2019d been a U.S. Marshal before joining the unit.</p><p>She wished she was as strong.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to take shooting lessons,\u201d Allison said as they left the attic.</p><p>Kelsey grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad idea to be acquainted with firearms, but it\u2019s a skill that came along with what I wanted to do. Hopefully, the world isn\u2019t so horrible that we all need to spend our days at a shooting range.\u201d</p><p>As they headed along the second floor landing to the staircase, Allison said, \u201cI hear you\u2019re engaged. Congratulations. Is it hard working with Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, and no, we work well together. We\u2019ve had a few bumps along the way, of course. I remember thinking that I wasn\u2019t happy about the \u2018unit\u2019 situation when it first came up, but then...things happened. When we\u2019re working, we\u2019re working. Our private time is private. But we\u2019re kind of like the marine corps in our philosophy. No man\u2014or woman\u2014left behind. So we\u2019re all protective of one another. Logan and I...we manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the others?\u201d Allison asked. \u201cHow do they manage their relationships?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean was in special effects before he joined the unit, so he and Madison have a great deal in common\u2014and they can both sleep on a plane. Which is good, since they\u2019ve been a continent apart. Things are easy enough for Kat, since she and Will have an apartment in Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane was in love with a cop who was killed in the line of duty a couple of years ago. She dates casually, but I think it\u2019ll be a while before she\u2019s ready for another serious relationship. She\u2019s seeing a suit in Washington now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA suit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother federal agent\u2014but he\u2019s in the tax division,\u201d Kelsey said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cOh. How does that work? I mean, does he have your...skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We don\u2019t say much when we\u2019re around him,\u201d Kelsey told her.</p><p>\u201cSo, you all live a pretty normal life?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it normal. But I will say, I like that we\u2019re together. It\u2019s nice to be unusual together.\u201d Kelsey paused. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask about Tyler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, well, what about Tyler?\u201d Allison tried to sound casual. But she fumbled with the switch as she turned on a hallway lamp, lighting their path to the stairs.</p><p>\u201cTyler is a great guy. He was one of Logan\u2019s best friends before we started this. They were both Texas Rangers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I knew that.\u201d Allison nodded.</p><p>\u201cEveryone looks at Tyler and thinks, \u2018Hmm, tough guy. He must get anything he wants and be as hard as a rock.\u2019 He\u2019s not like that at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very courteous.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s what you think, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt means we can see sparks when you\u2019re with him,\u201d Kelsey said.</p><p>Allison felt her face heat with a fiery blush. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about his life or his...relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he go out? Yes. Is he in a relationship? No, not that I\u2019m aware of, and I believe I would be. He\u2019s very private. He\u2019s kept what he knows, sees and does from almost everyone around him. I don\u2019t think Tyler could form a relationship with someone who wasn\u2019t...unusual, as well. He couldn\u2019t live a lie. Anyway, that\u2019s my two cents on the matter.\u201d</p><p>Allison realized she\u2019d paused to stare at Kelsey when Kelsey said, \u201cMaybe you should give Tyler a call now, and tell him about your talk with Martin Standish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I should do that.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey smiled and walked down the stairs.</p> <p>Allison called Tyler. He listened to her gravely and asked, \u201cHe\u2019s sure it was a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounded sure,\u201d Allison said. \u201cI guess that would suggest Sarah, Annette or Cherry Addison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah\u2019s dead, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe still might have called him. She wasn\u2019t dead then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, you could ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to go back to the morgue?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were the one she talked to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat\u2019s there now, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. Maybe she\u2019s made contact, but according to Kat, ghosts don\u2019t usually like to be around when an autopsy is being done on their remains. We\u2019ll go there sometime today.\u201d</p><p>Allison agreed. She wished Sarah was more like Julian\u2014and that she wasn\u2019t haunting the morgue, of all places.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d he said, and hung up.</p><p>When she came downstairs, Adam Harrison was gone. He\u2019d see them later at the gallery. Sean was adjusting a camera, and Jane beckoned them into the salon where she\u2019d been working. Allison told the others about the phone call.</p><p>Logan, as usual, was pragmatic. \u201cIt\u2019s not conclusive that the same person called this man and then attacked Julian, but it\u2019s certainly a lead,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if it was a woman...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Annette Fanning will come to the art show?\u201d Kelsey asked Allison.</p><p>\u201cI assume so,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe\u2014the guides\u2014supported the board members whenever we could. And vice versa.\u201d</p><p>Julian was there, staring down at prints Jane had made from the work she\u2019d been doing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s uncanny!\u201d Julian breathed as Kelsey and Allison came into the room.</p><p>Logan smiled at Allison. \u201cYou really need to take a look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took the picture of you off your Facebook page,\u201d Jane told her apologetically.</p><p>\u201cTyler is on to something,\u201d Logan said. \u201cCheck out the transparencies Jane\u2019s been working on.\u201d</p><p>Jane worked with mixed media, some of her examples done by transferring images on the computer and others using her own sketches.</p><p>Allison was a little afraid of what she was going to see.</p><p>But when they showed her what they were talking about, it was chilling.</p><p>Jane had juxtaposed pictures of Allison and paintings of Lucy Tarleton. When their faces were at the same angle and transparencies were placed on either image, they melded almost completely.</p><p>\u201cYou really do resemble her,\u201d Julian said. \u201cI always thought so, but back then any pretty dark-haired, blue-eyed young woman could look something like Lucy.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand what this means. I\u2019m not Lucy Tarleton come back to life. We\u2019ve seen her ghost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to learn what the relationship is,\u201d Logan said. \u201cIt may matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I know what it is.\u201d</p><p>Allison swung around. Tyler had returned, standing in the doorway of the grand salon.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Allison asked him.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI think your father\u2019s family did adopt a child. Not recently. I think they adopted him or her during the Revolution. I\u2019m willing to bet that Lucy Tarleton had an illegitimate child\u2014which her family would have covered up at the time\u2014and that child was taken in by the Leigh family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could Lucy have done everything she did, carry on with her espionage, even walk around Philly, pregnant?\u201d Allison demanded.</p><p>\u201cSupposedly queens and nobility managed to hide the births of their lovers\u2019 offspring throughout history,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThat would explain why Lucy\u2019s trying to get through to you. She\u2019s afraid for you and she believes the only way you\u2019ll be safe is if you find out who\u2019s killing people at this house\u2014and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn interesting theory,\u201d Jane said. \u201cAllison, don\u2019t look so stricken. It\u2019s a good thing\u2014if it\u2019s true. It means Lucy will do whatever she can to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich, I\u2019m afraid, isn\u2019t all that much.\u201d Julian grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m a ghost and what can I do? Hope to sound an alarm? Blow cold air at someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou moved paper today,\u201d Jane reminded him brightly.</p><p>\u201cIt took incredible will and practice,\u201d Julian said.</p><p>\u201cAh, but Lucy\u2019s been around for over two centuries,\u201d Tyler pointed out. \u201cShe\u2019s had time to learn. We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s capable of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot talking to her fellow ghosts, I can tell you that much,\u201d Julian said with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cLet me show you what else I\u2019ve come up with,\u201d Jane told them. \u201cI took pictures of the paintings and worked with them. I made three-dimensional head shapes\u2014the same as I did with Lucy and Allison,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd here\u2019s what I have of Beast Bradley.\u201d</p><p>Allison walked over to the end of the table. Jane had devised a picture that blended the two images of Beast Bradley, the one from the study and that from Lucy\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>The person she\u2019d portrayed was a new man. He was older than he appeared in the study painting, but the eyes were those from the painting in the bedroom. What they saw was a serious man, worn with the rigors of life, but thoughtful rather than cruel.</p><p>\u201cGreat image, Jane. It combines the two images into what\u2019s probably closest to truth,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cSo...where are we? I might be a descendent of Lucy\u2019s illegitimate child, and Beast Bradley was human. That doesn\u2019t tell us who killed Julian,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\u2019re getting there.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded slowly. \u201cIt was a woman who spoke to Martin Standish, and the one who has the most to lose\u2014being the last descendent of the Dandridge family\u2014is Cherry Addison. We\u2019ll see if we can trip her up tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhone tap?\u201d Tyler suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll speak to Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to go back to my house,\u201d Allison said. \u201cI guess now would be as good a time as any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you over,\u201d Tyler offered.</p><p>\u201cKelsey said she didn\u2019t mind...\u201d Allison began.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I could use a walk. Helps me think,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to stop by the morgue, as well, remember? So on second thought, we\u2019d better drive.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded, feeling excitement sweep through her veins. She turned quickly, not wanting anyone to see.</p><p>She was even willing to go back to the morgue for time alone with him. Well, sort of alone...</p><p>When she\u2019d first met Tyler, she\u2019d never imagined she could feel about him the way she did.</p><p>As much as it thrilled her, it scared her, too. Maybe, subconsciously, she felt she had to sabotage the possibility of the two of them being together. Maybe her last affair had been such a fiasco that she didn\u2019t trust her own instincts.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who wants to shower or shave or get ready in a real bathroom with lots of hot water is welcome to come to my house,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Logan called to her.</p><p>No one else responded. They were already talking again, working again.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t right to feel this way about a man she\u2019d just met.</p><p>But she did.</p><p>14</p><p>Even Dr. Grant, who\u2019d spent a great deal of time with Kat, knew Adam and had been as patient as a saint with them, was perturbed when Tyler told her they needed to see the body again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t deny his request, but looked at him very strangely.</p><p>\u201cDr. Sokolov was here with me during the autopsy. I assure you, everything was done correctly and thoroughly,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou know she was killed by a snakebite. We believe that snake was purposely put in Ms. Vining\u2019s car to kill her,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cDid her heart give out?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Grant nodded absently, clearly somewhat confused. But she allowed them to go back into the freezer and pull out the corpse. Tyler distracted her with questions about the autopsy, while Allison touched Sarah\u2019s face. She\u2019d closed her eyes and was completely still for several minutes. Dr. Grant began to stare at her, so Tyler distracted the doctor again with news about the accident.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, animal control found the snake. It was coiled up beneath the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer driving must have disturbed the creature,\u201d Dr. Grant said. \u201cMs. Vining had several contusions, and a broken rib\u2014from the air bag and struggling out of the car. I\u2019ve confirmed that the toxin, combined with the trauma of being hit by another vehicle, caused complete failure of her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for bearing with us,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe really want this solved. And, Dr. Grant, everything about this case is being kept quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We don\u2019t have leaks here, Agent Montague.\u201d</p> <p>He was glad to see Allison was stepping away from the corpse.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he told Dr. Grant a second time. \u201cWe\u2019ll try not to bother you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Oxford wants to make arrangements with a funeral home. He said he doesn\u2019t expect a large turnout, and that he and several other people associated with the house were her closest friends. But he\u2019s been asking me about releasing the body, since he\u2019d like to have a service for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always said she wanted to be buried or entombed at the Tarleton-Dandridge House,\u201d Allison murmured.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Dr. Grant seemed surprised. \u201cI thought Mr. Oxford said she was to be cremated.\u201d</p> <p>That was a surprise to both of them.</p><p>As they left the medical examiner\u2019s office, Tyler already had his phone out. Allison glanced at him quizzically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Adam. I don\u2019t want Sarah cremated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know she wouldn\u2019t have wanted that, either,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>He nodded. When he\u2019d finished speaking with Adam, Tyler hung up and looked at her. \u201cWell?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat did you learn from Sarah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe emphatically denies that she called Martin Standish to give him a hard time. In fact, she swears she never even talked to the man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was Sarah, but now we\u2019re sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead never lie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe dead are like the living. Was Sarah a liar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not that I know of,\u201d Allison replied.</p><p>\u201cThen why would she lie now? Did you ask her why she was so eager to help you sort through the stuff in the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she said she was worried. She didn\u2019t know why everything was messed up like that, and in light of what happened to Julian, she thought she could help figure things out.\u201d</p><p>They walked to the car. \u201cDo we have time for a quick stop at the hospital?\u201d she asked. \u201cI hate to disappoint a child and I promised Todd I\u2019d go to see his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, the hospital. It was right to go there; a child depended on them. But, in reality, was it going to change Artie Dixon\u2019s condition if and when they solved the murder?</p><p>And what the hell was the matter with him?</p><p>He was better off when he and Allison weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>When there were others around to ensure that he kept his distance.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>At the hospital he discovered that Haley Dixon maintained her constant vigil. She sat by her husband day and night; her sister brought the children to see their father, and then took them home, trying to keep their lives somewhat normal.</p><p>Allison convinced Haley to let her sit with Artie, and Tyler talked her into taking a break and going down to the hospital cafeteria with him.</p><p>He bought Haley a coffee and they sat at a table. She looked terrible. There were huge dark circles under her eyes and she was gaunt, as if she hadn\u2019t eaten since her husband got sick.</p><p>\u201cHas he woken again?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cEven for a few seconds?\u201d</p><p>Haley shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve PET-scanned him, CAT-scanned him, you-name-it-scanned him, and they can\u2019t find the reason. The doctor said it was as if a door had just shut in his brain, the door that gave him access to the outside world. Everyone here is so nice, but they\u2019ve already talked to me about places that provide extended care. They\u2019re at a loss.\u201d</p><p>Tyler murmured his sympathy.</p><p>She reached across the table and gripped his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re my only hope! Please, you and Ms. Leigh\u2014you\u2019re my only hope. You can\u2019t give up on us. You can\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t,\u201d Tyler promised her.</p><p>\u201cHe seems better after she\u2019s been here. That sounds ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it? He\u2019s in a coma. But it\u2019s as if he breathes easier, as if...as if there\u2019s sunshine in the room.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI know other dreadful things are going on. I heard about the accident. My sister said she barely missed being in it. Oh, my God! If my sister had been there...if my kids...I think I\u2019d lose my mind completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour children weren\u2019t in it and neither was your sister,\u201d Tyler said in a calm voice.</p><p>Her eyes focused on his. \u201cBut that woman... I never met her, but that woman who was killed\u2014she was on the board for the Tarleton-Dandridge House. I read about her in the paper. She caused the accident and now she\u2019s dead. She was from that awful, awful house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house didn\u2019t kill anyone, Mrs. Dixon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the painting does this stuff,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cThe painting of that heinous man, Beast Bradley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaintings don\u2019t kill, either. There\u2019s someone real and alive who\u2019s doing those things, and we\u2019re going to find out who it is. You have to protect your own health for your husband\u2019s sake\u2014and for your children.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and almost smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019s just...there was something about that painting. I was creeped out by it. So was Todd. Of course, it wasn\u2019t in the room with us when Artie slipped into the coma, but...I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t help thinking there\u2019s something wrong with it. Maybe Artie realized that before he went into the coma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll look at it again,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>She let out a soft sigh. \u201cThank you. It was good to get away for a few minutes, but we should head back now.\u201d</p><p>Allison had run out of things to say, but she kept talking, holding Artie Dixon\u2019s hand. She wasn\u2019t afraid...she even whispered to him that she was looking forward to spending more time alone with Agent Montague.</p><p>She paused when she thought she heard him speak. She went completely still, staring at him intently. He hadn\u2019t moved. Nothing about him had changed.</p><p>But it was as if he\u2019d spoken....</p><p>\u201cThe painting,\u201d he told her. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with that painting. Maybe if you can tear it apart, you\u2019ll discover what it is.\u201d</p><p>For a minute, ice filled her veins.</p><p>She\u2019d recently learned she could speak with the dead.</p><p>Was Artie dead?</p><p>She managed not to jerk her hands away. She hadn\u2019t breathed in that moment of shock; now she inhaled deeply. She could see his heartbeat on the monitor.</p><p>She heard Mrs. Dixon and Tyler in the hallway, returning to the room.</p><p>Squeezing Artie\u2019s hand, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll have them look at the painting again. I\u2019ll have their special-effects person tear it apart. We\u2019ll find out. I can hear you, and if I can hear you, you\u2019re in there and your family wants you well. Please\u2014come back to us,\u201d she whispered urgently.</p><p>When Mrs. Dixon and Tyler stepped back into the room, Allison released Mr. Dixon\u2019s hand and stood.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Haley Dixon hugged her gratefully.</p><p>\u201cAnytime. I mean that,\u201d Allison said. \u201cPlease give the children our regards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Todd will be so happy you were here.\u201d</p><p>They said their goodbyes. As they drove to her place, Allison asked, \u201cCould Sean be wrong about that painting? Could there be something wrong with it?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cFunny, that\u2019s what Haley was just saying to me. She\u2019s convinced the painting is evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cLooked like a painting to me,\u201d he said. \u201cSean is really good at what he does. He would\u2019ve seen any trick in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we should examine it again,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>They arrived at her house and got out of the car. She felt awkward when she let him in; she\u2019d wanted to be alone with him so badly and now here they were\u2014and she didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take a hot shower,\u201d she said. \u201cI got a cold blast this morning, and then I was at the morgue and...do you mind?\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. He\u2019d leaned against the door, watching her.</p><p>\u201cDo you mind?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to take a shower, too.\u201d The words tumbled from her lips. She didn\u2019t know whether she sounded serious or facetious.</p><p>A slow, rueful smile curved his lips. \u201cWith you?\u201d</p><p>She gazed back at him. She tried to think of something clever to say. A charming quip that would make her seem sophisticated and...</p><p>Not desperate.</p><p>Nothing came to her. Nothing at all.</p><p>\u201cUm, that would be great,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d He stiffened against the door, brows furrowed.</p><p>She flinched. She felt gawky and...pathetic.</p><p>\u201cI...I\u2019d love it if you took a shower with me,\u201d she managed at last. \u201cActually, I\u2019d like a great deal more than a shower with you.\u201d</p><p>He left the door, reaching her in a single stride. Then she was in his arms, and she felt her knees begin to tremble. In fact, her whole body was trembling; she could hardly remember how it felt to be held like this. He raised her chin and kissed her, and the pressure of his mouth was instantly erotic. She reveled in the searing heat of his tongue against her lips, then teasing its way into her mouth.</p><p>She kissed him feverishly in return. She felt something hard and steely and realized it wasn\u2019t him\u2014it was his gun.</p><p>He drew away from her, shrugging out of his jacket, pulling off his gun clip. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He made a move to pull her into his arms again, but she backed away and he looked at her, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cShower, please? I\u2019ve...envisioned this moment and I never thought I\u2019d smell like formaldehyde if and when...\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve envisioned this moment?\u201d</p> <p>Blushing, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cI have, too,\u201d he told her. \u201cWhat about protection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the pill.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, and she turned to go upstairs. She didn\u2019t hear him following her and she looked back, but he was only gathering up his jacket and gun and holster.</p><p>She hurried into the bathroom, silently thanking the powers that be\u2014her bathroom was spotlessly clean. She wondered if that was something men noticed. Then she forgot about it. She started the hot spray of the shower, and as she turned, she ended up in his arms. \u201cYour lips don\u2019t smell like any chemical at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a romantic thing to say, but...\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, pressing against him. Their lips touched again and they began pulling at each other\u2019s clothing, kicking off shoes, skimming off their jeans.</p><p>She\u2019d been right.</p><p>He was beautiful naked.</p><p>Later, she barely remembered stripping and helping him strip and stepping into the shower stall. She felt the delicious wet heat of the water, along with the stroking of his hands. They kissed again under the warm cascade, and she felt the full length of his body against hers.</p><p>Beautiful, and scarred. She knew he\u2019d been a Ranger and he\u2019d fought, bringing down criminals. And he was still in law enforcement. She didn\u2019t know what had caused the scars that lay white against the bronze of his flesh. She traced a white scar line on his lower abdomen and kissed it gently.</p><p>\u201cKnife wound. I didn\u2019t move quickly enough against a drug dealer in San Antonio,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>\u201cThank God he didn\u2019t kill you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing twenty-five to life.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes and he grimaced. Her fingers rode over another scar on his arm, with the steamy water following her touch.</p><p>He pulled her to him with a shrug. \u201cDodged a bullet outside Houston.\u201d</p><p>There was a third scar low on his abdomen. She eased against his body, feeling his heat and vitality along with the slickness of the steam. Her fingers traced the clean white line. \u201cThis one?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, drawing her up. \u201cAppendectomy,\u201d he said, and she smiled, and they kissed again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever been so stirred or felt such hunger and urgency. She wondered if they would make love in the shower stall.</p><p>But they didn\u2019t. Tyler lifted her up, leaving the shower, wrapped her in one of the bath towels and caressed her body as he dried it. She shivered at his touch, just savoring the feel, then growing more confident and pressing against him, forming her mouth to his, feeling the pounding of his heart and hers as their excitement began to soar. She nearly tripped on the towel; they both laughed and he swept her into his arms. The feel of his arms was a promise in itself....</p> <p>Falling down on the bed, smelling of soap and steam, they began to make love in earnest. His kisses traveled the length of her, teasing and intimate, and she lay still, feeling luxurious and then writhing and arching and returning every touch. When he rose above her and met her eyes and thrust with excruciating care into her body, she thought she\u2019d explode in that instant, but he withdrew and began a slow, intense movement, his eyes locked with hers. The world didn\u2019t seem in the least real, and yet she could feel the softness of the bed and the cool cotton of the sheets. But most of all she could feel the strength of his body. Everything that had happened in the past few days evaporated as sheer sensation seemed to lift her into a realm of ecstasy. She clung to him as waves of sensation rolled over her, as the climax seized her, and as she drifted in an aftermath that seemed a little like dying...and coming back to life.</p><p>When they lay silently, she stroked the rich, tawny fall of hair from his forehead, gazing into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI feel so right\u2014and so wrong,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He smiled and pulled her toward him. \u201cLiving is right,\u201d he told her. \u201cHurting others is wrong, but living...and finding something you\u2019ve longed for in life isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She realized again why they knew each other, as reality came crashing back upon her.</p><p>\u201cI feel so bad for Julian and Sarah,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He drew her close. \u201cAllison, we can hurt for others. But you\u2019re doing everything you can to help them. Taking a breath yourself isn\u2019t wrong. Life is precious and fragile, and we live it while we can.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare get too comfortable. She nestled against his chest and started to speak. But then she trembled. \u201cYour life is filled with people who are ready to take on any fight,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd when you met me, I was a basket case at the police station. You know so many women who are heroines in real life, and I\u2019ve been...pretty much a sniveling coward.\u201d</p><p>His fingers threaded into her hair and he smiled, not with amusement, but with wonder. \u201cHave you never heard?\u201d he asked her. \u201cCourage isn\u2019t about not feeling fear. Courage is when you\u2019re terrified\u2014but go forth, anyway. I think you\u2019re one of the bravest women I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>There was something in his words, something in the way he spoke, and she felt her muscles begin to relax as she curled up again.</p><p>He smoothed back her hair and teased, \u201cAll right, the first time I saw you, you were a sniveling coward....\u201d</p><p>She laughed and started to rise. \u201cThe art showing,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>His lips found hers again.</p><p>\u201cWe can make love quickly,\u201d she whispered against his lips.</p><p>\u201cUm, not too quickly. But we\u2019ll shower again and dress for the occasion with all due haste.\u201d</p><p>When his fingers traveled seductively down her spine, she could only agree.</p><p>Cherry Addison stood at the entrance to the gallery as if she were royalty greeting her subjects.</p><p>Her manner was gracious\u2014and affected, in Tyler\u2019s opinion.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to be at the showing, after all. He would\u2019ve liked a night with Allison, never getting out of bed. A night in which he described the good, the bad and the ugly in his life, and learned more about hers.</p><p>Except, of course, people had died. And it was important that they be here.</p><p>Cherry welcomed them as they came in. She was standing with her husband, George, who smiled and seemed to be a genuinely warm man. The gallery owner was there, as well, directing people toward the food and drink and telling them they mustn\u2019t miss the collage.</p><p>On their way to get some appetizers and a glass of wine, they walked down the gallery, looking at the paintings. George Addison was very good. The works on the wall depicted images of modern life: a mother holding a newborn, her eyes filled with exhilaration and exhaustion, a child watching a balloon disappear into the sky, a construction worker on a girder, happy as he opened a lunch pail high above the world. The details were contemporary but the emotions were enduring, universal.</p><p>\u201cI can actually say I love his stuff!\u201d Jane said, coming up behind them.</p><p>\u201cTake a look at the other wall,\u201d Logan suggested, joining them, too.</p><p>Tyler set a hand on Allison\u2019s back as they walked toward the other side. Here, George Addison had done similar work but these included historical scenes and people. Tyler thought the paintings on this wall were even finer, more unusual, than the others.</p><p>One depicted a tree with a worn-out, dirt-smudged Union soldier on one side, and a bleeding Rebel on the other. A lone World War I soldier huddled in a trench with dead men and dead horses around him.</p><p>He had painted the Tarleton-Dandridge House with a woman in front.</p><p>Lucy Tarleton. She stood there with strength evident in her expression, her stance\u2014and sadness in her eyes.</p><p>Glancing down at Allison, Tyler saw that she was staring at the image, the same sadness in her own eyes. She looked up at him and flushed. \u201cShe\u2019s so conflicted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a time of conflict,\u201d he reminded her. He lowered his voice. \u201cAnd, if I\u2019m right, she had the problem of a hidden, illicit child to worry about!\u201d</p><p>They studied the rest of the paintings, all of them imbued with a similar life and humanity.</p><p>Finally they made their way over to the bar. Annette Fanning and Jason Lawrence were there, looking a little lost. Allison greeted them both with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cNice showing, with Sarah dead on a morgue slab!\u201d Annette whispered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t stop the mighty wheels of...art showings,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cIf I understand correctly,\u201d Tyler told them, \u201cit was impossible to cancel the gallery and undo all the setup at such a late date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. And George didn\u2019t know Sarah all that well,\u201d Annette said. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy. No idea how Cherry rated him. Oops!\u201d Her eyes went wide. \u201cI didn\u2019t just say that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll say this.\u201d Jason lifted his glass, smiling at someone across the room. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity it was Sarah, and not Cherry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d Allison said, horrified.</p><p>\u201cSarah was nicer. A lot nicer,\u201d Jason muttered.</p><p>\u201cJulian and Sarah are dead,\u201d Annette said. \u201cThis all seems so wrong.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded. \u201cAnd here we are\u2014the three guides who remain, huddled together. And there they are, the three remaining board members.\u201d She pointed across the room. Ethan Oxford and Nathan Pierson had arrived and joined Cherry.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI have a question for Cherry.\u201d</p><p>He left them and walked over to the gathering of the board. Ethan eyed him warily; Tyler knew that even though he\u2019d done his best to be polite during their conversation earlier, Ethan had taken offense. He knew Adam had been to see him again after that, but he wasn\u2019t sure how warm Ethan\u2019s greeting would be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tyler said hello to the two men, both of them friendly in their response. Obviously, Ethan had decided that any disagreement had no place in a social situation of this kind. Cherry smiled benevolently.</p><p>\u201cCherry\u2019s husband is talented, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Pierson said.</p><p>\u201cVery,\u201d Tyler agreed. \u201cHe makes me think of the paintings at the Tarleton-Dandridge House. Both of those oils of Beast Bradley were painted by men with real skill.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGeorge loves those two paintings,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cYou have to tell him you see something similar in his work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust curious, but I\u2019m sure you read in the paper that the young boy whose dad is still in a coma believes Beast Bradley came alive in that painting in the study,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cHave you ever felt or seen anything unusual about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt reveals a lot of bitterness,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBut then, it was painted by Lucy Tarleton\u2019s brother-in-law, who had reason to hate Beast Bradley. Apparently, Tobias had been an up-and-coming artist before the war, but that was his last painting. He was injured in the right arm by a musket ball just before the battle of Yorktown. That painting was done immediately after the British left Philly, and he never painted again. There are a few of his prewar pieces in museums, mostly in New York.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s just a painting,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cI was saddened to hear about the man and his son. When something terrible happens, there has to be a reason, even if we don\u2019t understand it. To a young impressionable boy, I can easily imagine it might be that painting.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded and changed the subject. None of them seemed convinced that the painting was evil. He thought they were genuine; he could usually sense an outright lie.</p> <p>\u201cCherry, do you know Martin Standish?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She flushed slightly. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA historian named Martin Standish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never met him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever spoken with him?\u201d</p><p>The others were glancing from Cherry to him in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve spoken with him,\u201d she said defiantly. \u201cHe writes dreadful articles about the Tarleton-Dandridge House and my family. I\u2019ve called him and warned him to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry!\u201d Ethan admonished.</p><p>\u201cEthan, the man is a fruitcake. He has some deluded idea about being an expert on the Revolution and he writes a lot of nonsense with no evidence whatsoever.\u201d She faced Tyler. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was just curious,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019ve read a few of his articles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re trash. And lies,\u201d Cherry insisted.</p><p>He smiled at her and turned back to the others. \u201cDid you know that Sarah was actually killed by a snake?\u201d</p><p>Ethan Oxford looked at him gravely. Of course he already knew.</p><p>\u201cA snake?\u201d Pierson seemed skeptical.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Cherry asked. \u201cAnd please, hush, this is uncomfortable as it is. We should have canceled tonight, but we couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a snake in Sarah\u2019s car. It bit her. That\u2019s why the car went out of control,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cA snake\u2014in her car?\u201d Cherry shuddered. \u201cWhat kind of snake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA copperhead. And yes, please keep this quiet. The police aren\u2019t letting out any information about the cause of the accident yet. It\u2019s still under investigation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopperheads are plentiful in the woods,\u201d Nathan Pierson said, shaking his head. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them getting into people\u2019s homes, but a car? How unusual.\u201d</p><p>Cherry shuddered again. \u201cThe poor dear! I can\u2019t imagine.... Oh, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>With a quick farewell, she walked away. \u201cHave you ever had an encounter with a copperhead?\u201d Tyler asked the men.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Oxford said stonily. \u201cI\u2019ve told you. I\u2019m a hiker.\u201d</p><p>Pierson laughed. \u201cMe? No. If I found a snake, I doubt if I\u2019d even know what kind it was. I\u2019d call the animal experts in a flash!\u201d He sobered, looking at Tyler. \u201cPoor Sarah. She was such a timid little creature. It\u2019s even more horrible to think about how terrified she must have been before she died. Excuse me. I\u2019m going to go and say hello to that group over there.\u201d</p><p>As he left them. Ethan Oxford frowned at Tyler with open hostility. \u201cMy friends don\u2019t go around planting snakes in people\u2019s cars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize if I\u2019ve offended you, Mr. Oxford. But you did call Adam in.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sighed. Tyler walked with him as he moved toward one of the paintings; to a casual observer, it would look as if they were discussing it. \u201cYes, I called Adam in,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut I thought you people could...perform an exorcism or something.\u201d</p><p>Tyler shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t perform exorcisms, so I don\u2019t know what you were really hoping for. Truth? Well, it\u2019s hard to fathom what\u2019s happened in this house. The first \u2018more recent\u2019 death occurred in the late seventies. Accident? Who knows? A man fell down the stairs and broke his neck. But eight years ago a college student was electrocuted by a system that should never have failed the way it did. Three years ago, you had a guide die in the study, someone who died in exactly that same place as Julian Mitchell. And now a man has fallen into a coma after visiting the house. There\u2019s a pattern here and it has to be stopped.\u201d</p><p>Oxford turned to him. \u201cIt\u2019s the ghosts, don\u2019t you understand?\u201d</p><p>Tyler was startled, taken aback by the man\u2019s desperate appeal.</p><p>\u201cThe ghosts there kill people. They do. I\u2019ve heard from others...who\u2019ve told me the painting of Bradley is evil. I couldn\u2019t say that in front of Nathan and Cherry. And I certainly couldn\u2019t tell it to the regular cops. But you know the ghosts are there, and you have to...make them go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Oxford, the ghosts may be there. I pray they are, and that they help us. Because a ghost didn\u2019t go out in the woods, capture a snake and put it in Sarah\u2019s car. And a ghost didn\u2019t smash Julian Mitchell\u2019s head down on a bayonet. Someone living, probably in this room right now, did those things. And we\u2019ll find out who it is.\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded politely and excused himself, walking back to where the guides were gathered with members of his Krewe.</p><p>\u201cI wish Sarah was here. I\u2019m going to miss her,\u201d Jason Lawrence was saying. He raised his plastic wineglass. \u201cTo Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Sarah,\u201d they all repeated, raising their own glasses.</p><p>As they spoke, Tyler noted that Julian, a ghost still clad in Colonial attire, was in the gallery, wandering in their direction. Allison saw him and smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd Julian,\u201d Allison added.</p><p>\u201cAnd Julian,\u201d they all chorused.</p><p>\u201cAn entertaining guy, even if he was an irresponsible ass,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>Julian frowned. He waved a hand, which went right through Jason\u2019s glass. But he tried again, and this time, Jason\u2019s champagne spilled on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cWow, that was clumsy!\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cJulian!\u201d Allison remonstrated.</p><p>The ghost grinned. The others stared at Allison.</p><p>\u201cJulian, uh, he was a good guy,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, and maybe he really would\u2019ve gotten us all backstage passes to some really great musical acts,\u201d Annette said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019d just left the house when Julian died, and that I was walking around with a tray of beer mugs when I saw the news about Sarah on TV,\u201d Jason said. \u201cIt all seems so...hard to grasp. That I missed Julian\u2019s death by minutes and that I was doing something so...ordinary when Sarah died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asleep, mourning my lack of work,\u201d Annette told them.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a wonder no one else was killed in that accident,\u201d Logan said, \u201cand a blessing.\u201d</p><p>Adam Harrison arrived then. Tyler noticed that he spent most of his time with Ethan, although in typical Adam fashion, he moved around the room and seemed to make everyone in it feel comfortable.</p><p>Tyler\u2019s mind raced. Cherry had made the call to Martin Standish. Ethan had been in the woods.</p><p>Jason had been at work. But how long had he been there? Had he just started his shift? He wasn\u2019t going to ask Jason; he\u2019d ask Evan McDooley.</p><p>Nathan Pierson denied any knowledge of snakes.</p><p>Annette didn\u2019t have an alibi; sleep had never been one.</p><p>Allison and the Krewe went back to the Tarleton-Dandridge House, where they discussed the evening, pointing out the merits of the various suspects.</p><p>It came time for bed at last. Tyler reminded Allison to keep her door ajar so he could hear her and watch out for her.</p><p>Kelsey gave a loud sigh of exasperation.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think we\u2019re all blind?\u201d she demanded. \u201cKeep Allison really safe\u2014stay in the same room. Don\u2019t bother with this pretense. Lord, please, spare us from those who think we\u2019re idiots and don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on!\u201d</p><p>Tyler looked at Allison.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of you are blind or idiots. I\u2019ll get my things,\u201d she said to Tyler.</p><p>He felt like a college kid. But Sean had already waved good-night, and Jane and Kat had gone into the room they were sharing.</p><p>\u201cSee you in the morning,\u201d Logan said, shrugging as if to disavow any connection with his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s outburst.</p><p>He walked into Lucy Tarleton\u2019s room. A moment later, Allison joined him.</p><p>And all he could do was smile.</p><p>15</p><p>Allison caught herself humming as she went down to shower the next morning. Everyone knew where she\u2019d been all night, but they all seemed pleased that she and Tyler were happy in each other\u2019s company, or they didn\u2019t consider it any of their business.</p><p>She met Logan in the kitchen after her shower. He brought her a cup of coffee and asked, \u201cAllison, what\u2019s in the second article by Martin Standish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI printed it out after I talked to him yesterday,\u201d Allison said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting piece on the conflict of loyalties in the colonies. Many people wanted to stand up for their rights\u2014no taxation without representation\u2014but they didn\u2019t want to split from the mother country. Of course, most schoolchildren know that a lot of those Loyalists either returned to England or went to Canada. The article talks about the way we tend to think of Philly as a city that was occupied. We forget that there were people here who accepted it, saw it as a done deal. They gave up their loyalty to the fledgling United States and welcomed the British. Angus Tarleton was no spring chicken when they occupied the city. According to the Standish article, he was old and tired and wanted to live out his life in peace. Most of their friends tended to sympathize with the patriot cause, and, whether it was official or not, Lucy had been with an ardent patriot, Stewart Douglas, who\u2019d left to fight with the American forces. But, as Standish points out, there\u2019s no mention of Stewart Douglas having been at Valley Forge. Some historians suspect he was going in and out of Philly, stealing supplies, listening for information and secrets. But whether or not he saw Lucy before her death, no one knows. The article hints that Lucy might not have been pretending her affection for Beast Bradley. There\u2019s no question that she started out using him for whatever information she could gather for the forces, but she might have fallen in love with him and suffered serious conflicts because of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUntil he killed her,\u201d Tyler suggested from the doorway. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t bode well for an affair. Remind me of the exact date Philly was occupied,\u201d he said as he walked into the pantry to pour himself coffee.</p><p>\u201cSeptember 26, 1777,\u201d she answered. \u201cThere\u2019d been a lot of jockeying between George Washington and Howe, but Howe got around Washington after a few skirmishes. Usually, in war, when a capital city is taken, the war is over\u2014but the British didn\u2019t count on the patriots continuing to fight. The British general Cornwallis surrendered on October 19, 1781, at Yorktown. There were skirmishes after that, but it was the last major battle, although the Treaty of Paris wasn\u2019t signed until September 3, 1783, officially ending the war.\u201d</p><p>Tyler and Logan looked at each other, grinning.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I teach this stuff,\u201d Allison said. \u201cIn fact, I do a course on the history of American government, comparing the Revolutionary era to our modern politics. Not that much has really changed since those early days. They all had different opinions back then, too. Not everyone worshipped the ground Washington walked on. He had his critics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but the British got here on September 26, 1777,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd when did they leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn June 18, 1778. That\u2019s when they evacuated Philadelphia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lucy Tarleton died on what date?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s believed she was killed just before the British evacuated. According to the stories we have, Beast Bradley murdered her in the grand salon hours before leaving the city. Angus was apparently found cradling his daughter\u2019s body by Tobias Dandridge, the man who would later marry Sophia\u2014and the artist who painted the likeness of Bradley in the study.\u201d</p> <p>Logan and Tyler looked at each other again.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cSeptember to June. Nine months\u2014give or take a few weeks,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cAre you saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuppose history has it wrong,\u201d he went on. \u201cWhat if Beast Bradley moved in and Lucy fell for him right away? Or, even if she wasn\u2019t in love with him, what if she was willing to use him for information, as you said? And willing to sleep with him to keep her family safe? According to all the stories, she played at being attracted to him. So, what if she had a child with him\u2014and she was killed because of that child?\u201d</p><p>Allison groaned. \u201cAnd one of my ancestors was that child? I don\u2019t know\u2014they would\u2019ve had to begin their affair immediately. And the child had to have been born just before she died. And if she was killed, why would someone let the child live?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI imagine it\u2019s easier to kill a woman who\u2019s angered or betrayed you than a helpless infant,\u201d Logan said. \u201cThe murder might have been because he was furious, a crime of passion. If Beast Bradley killed her.\u201d</p><p>Allison was thoughtful. \u201cOkay, wait,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cYou think maybe Lucy did care about Beast Bradley, and that she had an affair with him\u2014and a child. So someone else killed her. Who? Angus? Because his daughter had, in his view, betrayed him and her country? And, of course, the baby was innocent, so he asked the Leigh who would\u2019ve been my ancestor to take the baby in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s a theory we can investigate when we go to Valley Forge. I want to hear what Martin Standish has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison, did he come to his theories and conclusions because of letters in his possession?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. But it\u2019s difficult to prove those theories because the letters might not be signed. Or they\u2019re signed with initials or just a term of endearment. This would be for the protection of both the writer and the recipient.\u201d Allison paused. \u201cThe war was a hard, sad time for many. Some letters were written by soldiers and sent out. Others were written by friends and relatives and smuggled in to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValley Forge is only twenty miles northwest of Philly,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cBut our appointment with Standish is at two this afternoon. Since we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll find out or how long it might take, I suggest we plan on staying overnight if need be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind being out of the city for a night,\u201d Allison murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou feel you need to get out of this house for a while?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I also have a feeling there\u2019s something in Valley Forge we need to know. Maybe you\u2019re right and we have the history all wrong,\u201d Allison said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do some cajoling to get Martin to really help us. He was pretty angry about that phone call of Cherry\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who more than Cherry would receive a comedown if it was proven that Allison is a descendent\u2014not just of the house, but of Lucy Tarleton,\u201d Logan remarked. \u201cWhat\u2019s your feeling about Cherry?\u201d he asked Tyler.</p><p>\u201cI agree that she stands to lose the most,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cMartin Standish is passionate\u2014and possessive!\u2014in regard to his letters,\u201d Allison told them. \u201cHe admits there\u2019s no way to prove who wrote them, but according to the article, he believes they belonged to \u2018heroes and heroines who dared not write their names.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he get hold of these letters?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>Allison shrugged. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said. It can be big business, you know. There are many letters from all periods of history in private hands. Sometimes people don\u2019t even realize they own them. They find them when they\u2019re cleaning out an attic or a basement. Anytime you go to a reenactment, you\u2019ll generally see collectors buying and selling historical items and letters. There\u2019s nothing illegal about owning them. Sometimes, what happens is that children inherit collections or letters, guns, even articles of clothing\u2014and they don\u2019t have a real appreciation for those objects.\u201d She gave another shrug. \u201cSo they might have them appraised and sell them. That\u2019s how some of them came on to the market. In Martin Standish\u2019s case, he\u2019s a true lover of the era, and his collection is precious to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s just going to let us rummage through everything?\u201d Tyler asked her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNot rummage. I think, if I approach him in the right way, he\u2019ll let us study his documents. You do realize they won\u2019t be in a stack on his desk. He\u2019ll have done everything necessary to preserve them.\u201d</p><p>Tyler clapped his hands. \u201cRoad trip. Let\u2019s get started.\u201d He turned to Logan. \u201cWe keep coming back to that painting of Beast Bradley in the study. With the overlays Jane\u2019s done, we probably have a truer image of the man. But that doesn\u2019t help with what we\u2019ve heard about the painting\u2014from Julian, from the Dixon family, from Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Sean on it again,\u201d Logan promised.</p><p>They took their time driving to Valley Forge.</p><p>Tyler enjoyed the trip. Being with Allison was like being with a personal guide; she pointed out landmarks along the way and memorials to events that had taken place. The patriots hadn\u2019t just abandoned Philadelphia. The British had won the Battle of Brandywine. There\u2019d been a rain-out, basically a draw, at the Battle of the Clouds.</p><p>They stopped at the site of the Paoli Massacre and spent an hour walking around the pristine grounds where the British had routed Anthony Wayne\u2019s troops on September 20, 1777.</p><p>Looking out over the beautiful countryside, just touched by the gentle breeze of the late-summer day, Tyler found himself seeing the era that had given them their country through Allison\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou told me once that courage wasn\u2019t about not being afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cI still marvel when I think about the fight these men waged. Every man who put his name on the Declaration of Independence knew that doing so made him a traitor, and if the war was lost and he was captured, he could be executed. They had to be afraid. Only an idiot wouldn\u2019t be. The British had the most powerful fighting forces in the world at the time, and those men\u2014Washington, Jefferson, all the others\u2014still signed that piece of paper. Washington\u2019s army faced near-starvation, a lack of supplies, lack of clothing...and, of course, some did desert. But whenever I think about it, I\u2019m in awe that we have a country. They were routed again and again, but they prevailed in the end.\u201d She smiled mischievously. \u201cAnd there were a few victories in there! The Americans did win against the British general Burgoyne during the Battle of Saratoga. And once Lafayette arrived and Pulaski helped whip our men into fighting shape, the army was in much better condition.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his arms around her, pulling her close. \u201cYou make me see the world in a whole new light,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She leaned against him. The sun was shining down on her hair, which made it look as dark and glossy as a raven\u2019s wing. He had to remind himself that they weren\u2019t on a date\u2014or sightseeing.</p><p>\u201cSo, there\u2019s action all around Philly, even after the British occupy the city,\u201d he said pensively. \u201cWhen they do, our Lucy, who\u2019s friends with a number of fighting men, immediately begins her flirtation with Lord Brian Bradley. Whenever she gains information, she rides out. Sadly, I guess neither she nor any other patriot spy reached this particular battlefield in time. Sounds like it was a horrible massacre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Americans repulsed the British at Whitemarsh,\u201d Allison said. \u201cLucy might have been able to get information to someone about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWashington retired with his forces to Valley Forge in December, right?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cDecember 19,\u201d Allison replied. \u201cWe should move on. You can see some of the landscape around there before we meet up with Martin Standish. The old stone farmhouses that were used as headquarters still exist and they\u2019ve built replicas of the wooden huts the soldiers used to survive the winter. You\u2019ve never been there? On a school trip or a family vacation, maybe?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. But I can tell you the story of the Alamo with every detail and every argument about the deaths of our Texas heroes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2018Don\u2019t mess with Texas!\u2019\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>They made the drive to Valley Forge, and once they arrived, Tyler was even more impressed. There had been no fighting at Valley Forge; there were still fortifications and cannon and all manner of defenses. At the time, the Americans hadn\u2019t known the British wouldn\u2019t chase them to the valley.</p><p>But despite the lack of fighting, there had been many, many deaths. Two thousand had died from the harshness of that winter and the diseases that riddled the troops.</p> <p>They stopped to see George Washington\u2019s restored headquarters, and Tyler felt humbled as he studied the general\u2019s maps and other artifacts. From beyond the little house and the hill on which it sat, he saw an exceptional view of the Schuylkill River.</p><p>At quarter to two, they came to an old corner brick building, where a small sign announced Standish House: Open upon Appointment.</p><p>Tyler had barely knocked when Martin Standish opened the door. He was a wizened little man with Ben Franklin glasses, wispy white hair and a round belly.</p><p>Indeed, he looked like an older Ben Franklin.</p><p>\u201cCome in, come in,\u201d he said, hustling them inside and locking the door behind them. \u201cNo one followed you, did they?\u201d</p> <p>Tyler was surprised. \u201cNo one knows we\u2019re here, Mr. Standish,\u201d he assured the man. \u201cThis is Allison Leigh. You\u2019ve spoken to her online and on the phone. And I\u2019m Agent Tyler Montague, with the FBI. Why are you afraid we were followed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI received several calls this morning, from people asking to see my collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat people?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cYoung lady, if I knew that, I wouldn\u2019t be so worried. But considering everything that\u2019s happened, I don\u2019t trust too many people. In fact, after you two leave today, I\u2019m going out of town for a while. This is all making me very nervous,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou feel threatened?\u201d Tyler tried to take in the little museum as he spoke. It was really the man\u2019s downstairs living area. But there were display cases on tables throughout; he had remnants of clothing, vests, caps, belts and a number of powder horns and flintlock muskets. The walls were adorned with maps and sketches of generals and the rank and file of the Revolutionary armies.</p><p>Standish was watching him and shaking his head. \u201cWhat, sir? Agent or not, what are you, stupid?\u201d Standish demanded rudely. \u201cYou\u2019ve got corpses at that house. And I\u2019ve got that woman calling me first, and this morning I get three calls, and oddly enough, although the voices were similar, each claimed to be from a different place\u2014supposedly researchers out of Virginia, New York City and Vermont! And what\u2019s happening in Philly around the Tarleton-Dandridge House? That\u2019s scary. Coincidence that a woman dies in a car accident after a fellow stabs himself to death with his costume bayonet? No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t believe in coincidence, no sirree. I\u2019m getting out of here and not telling a soul except my daughter where I\u2019ll be.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler glanced at Allison. \u201cCould you tell whether the caller today was a man or a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t tell at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like your permission to check your phone records. We can find out where those calls came from,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Standish raised his brows. \u201cSure. If you can do that, great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt only takes a phone call.\u201d</p><p>Standish seemed to like him then.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it. Someone\u2019s worried that the story about the Tarleton-Dandridge House might not be entirely true,\u201d Standish said. \u201cWe need to admit our mistakes. I\u2019m referring to the things we did wrong and the stories we got wrong. It doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not a great country if we do. Lord, there\u2019s power in seeing the past clearly.\u201d He looked at Allison. \u201cYou teach history to our young minds. You know it\u2019s wrong to pollute the past by pretending that the men who came before us were without fault. The media today puts every indiscretion, big or small, out there for the world to see. But can anyone in our society be foolish enough not to realize that men of power have always held a sexual attraction for those around them? And that they\u2019re frequently willing to exploit it?\u201d He made a scornful sound, shaking his head. \u201cThomas Jefferson! We worship the ground he walked on, but he had an affair with his slave Sally Hemings. Everyone back then talked about it and his mixed-race children\u2014everyone except Jefferson. The man just kept mum.\u201d He wagged a finger in the air. \u201cBut the interesting thing is that Sally Hemings was already Jefferson\u2019s sister-in-law. She was the daughter of Jefferson\u2019s wife\u2019s father. People talked about him back then, but he still came down in history as a great man. But scandal isn\u2019t new, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mr. Standish, scandal isn\u2019t new at all. I don\u2019t think most people are alarmed when politicians are human. I think we\u2019re alarmed when they lie and make bad decisions. When we see that a politician lied about an affair and covered it up, we wonder what else he might lie about,\u201d Allison said.</p> <p>Tyler cleared his throat. \u201cWhat\u2019s the lie that surrounds the Tarleton-Dandridge House, Mr. Standish? If we can discover the truth, maybe we can prove that someone doesn\u2019t want history changed\u2014and we can make sure no one else is killed.\u201d He took out his phone and put a call through to Logan, asking Standish for particulars as he requested Logan to get Standish\u2019s phone records pulled.</p><p>\u201cNow, as to Lucy Tarleton! Let me show you....\u201d</p><p>Standish had been ready for them. They weren\u2019t going to have to sort through anything.</p><p>He brought out a safety deposit box. \u201cI keep the museum at a constant temperature of about sixty-eight degrees,\u201d he told them. \u201cYou don\u2019t go laminating precious things like this. You don\u2019t cover them with any substance and you don\u2019t use paper clips or the like. And you handle them as little as possible. I have copies, but...\u201d He turned to Allison. \u201cFor you, the real thing.\u201d</p><p>Allison thanked him with a grateful smile that seemed to make his day.</p><p>Standish brought over a magnifying glass. \u201cHelps to read that old cursive style with the glass...and there\u2019s a light on it, a mild one. Harsh sunlight and artificial light can play havoc with such valuable pieces.\u201d</p><p>Standish removed a letter from the box and laid it out on a clean glass surface. \u201cThere, my dear!\u201d</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t touch it. Standish held the glass and she read aloud, \u201c\u2018My dearest friend and confidant, my...prayers are with you for your safety always. My father and sister fare well and my own disposition is excellent. The dreary days of pain go on, but I must tell you that nothing puts us in distress. There are galas, which I of course attend; they are the greatest source of pleasure for one such as me, and from them I gain my strength. Do not fear for me or my family. The emotions that tug at the heart are one matter, while the truth of the day is another. I remain, most and always, faithfully, your best friend.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Allison looked up at Standish. She smiled and quoted, \u201c\u2018...they are the greatest source of pleasure for one such as me.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreatest source of pleasure,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cBecause those parties were where Lucy got her information.\u201d</p><p>Allison spoke excitedly. \u201cIf Lucy did write this, she was writing to a friend in the patriot forces. She wanted him to know she wasn\u2019t suffering and she hinted at what she was doing for the American cause. If Lucy wrote it.\u201d</p><p>Standish smiled. He went to one of the display cases and brought out a framed livestock bill. \u201cThis is a copy, but it\u2019s a bill that was signed by Lucy Tarleton. You see her signature and her notation that she would like ten more laying chickens. Look at the writing, and then look at the letter.\u201d</p><p>Allison and Tyler both did. The handwriting was almost identical, down to the curlicues on her capital letters.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an S on this side of the sheet. I assume she didn\u2019t have access to an envelope. But I suspect Lucy gave this letter to a friend here at Valley Forge and the friend was to give it to S\u2014Stewart Douglas,\u201d Standish explained.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted him to know she was doing well,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cShe wanted him to know she was collecting secrets and living in comparative comfort,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cBut...it doesn\u2019t sound like a letter one would write a lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Standish seemed pleased.</p><p>Tyler was glad. His last remark had apparently improved the man\u2019s estimation of his intelligence.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s the second!\u201d Standish said, producing a second safety deposit box. He did love his letters. There was a case for each.</p><p>Allison read again. Once more, the letter was addressed to \u201cMy dearest friend and confidant.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018You may have heard the rumors concerning my health. I am well, no matter what is said. Because you know me, I am certain you will understand. Know I have not and will not betray our cause or that which is expected of me. And if you fail to understand, you will nonetheless have pity and forgiveness for me. We all play our role in the human drama set before us, with its treacheries of flesh and feeling that may become a small part of the tragedy that wrecks our world. Pray, understand. I am a true friend to you and to all that is our dream. However, when you hear about wolves that howl at night and tear at man and creature, do not be deceived. Rumor must start when there is an enemy, even though that enemy be nothing more than human. I pray for your health; beware the diseases that ravage. Stay low, my dear brother, and keep your powder dry,\u2019\u201d Allison read.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes?\u201d Standish prompted.</p><p>\u201cSo, Stewart Douglas wasn\u2019t the great love of her life. She was trying to explain that she set out to seduce Brian Bradley\u2019s secrets from him, playing a role, but she found she enjoyed her role too much\u2014she really cared for the man,\u201d Tyler conjectured. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Standish said with great delight. \u201cThere\u2019s one more letter that bears examination,\u201d he said, bringing out another of his safety deposit boxes. \u201cThis one,\u201d he told them, \u201cis from S to L. It has to be from Stewart Douglas to Lucy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tyler stepped forward. This time, he read aloud. \u201c\u2018My dearest friend and sweetest confidant, little sister mine. I laugh sometimes when I think of the roles the world would have us play and the roles that Fate gives to us instead. I pray for your safety above all else, because it is a dangerous stage upon which you perform. I had heard they noticed the anxiety upon your beautiful face. Whatever the future may bring, wherever it will take you, do not let it steal away the smile you used to wear. We are but a speck in the grand scheme of God\u2019s great plan. While you may play true to your design, remember that war will end.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cStewart Douglas wasn\u2019t angry with her. It doesn\u2019t even sound as if he was\u2014or had ever been\u2014in love with her,\u201d Allison commented.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the professional historian,\u201d he said, smiling at her, \u201cand I\u2019m just an amateur. But I do know that marriages were frequently arranged at the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course. They were good friends and perhaps the families expected her to marry Stewart. But he wasn\u2019t out for Bradley\u2019s blood for having taken his fianc\u00e9e. He understood what she was telling him.\u201d Allison sighed. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t mean Bradley didn\u2019t kill Lucy Tarleton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe comments regarding her health might have referred to a pregnancy,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes! That\u2019s possible,\u201d Standish agreed.</p><p>\u201cBut if Lucy was pregnant with Bradley\u2019s child,\u201d Allison said, \u201cwhy would he have killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe in a fit of rage,\u201d Standish suggested.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he did kill her,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>\u201cIf he didn\u2019t, then who did? It doesn\u2019t sound like it would have been Stewart Douglas. The way these letters read, it\u2019s more like a sister and brother writing to each other,\u201d Allison argued.</p><p>\u201cI made copies for you. You may take them,\u201d Standish said, as if presenting them with the crown jewels.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s extremely kind of you, Mr. Standish,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed, thank you.\u201d Tyler felt the buzz of his cell phone in his pocket, excused himself and answered it.</p><p>It was Logan, and he already had a report on the phone records. \u201cThere were seven calls made to Mr. Standish this morning. Four of them were from Ms. Mia Standish of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMia\u2019s your daughter, I assume?\u201d he asked Standish, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Tyler returned to Logan.</p><p>\u201cThe other three were made from a prepaid cell. It was purchased with cash on Saturday from a Quickie Mart, so no one knows who bought that particular phone. But tracing the satellites, we know the calls were made from Philly.\u201d</p><p>Tyler thanked Logan and assured him they were making headway. He hung up and explained to Standish that they couldn\u2019t trace the calls more precisely because they\u2019d been made from a prepaid cell phone.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d get the info on that.\u201d He looked at Tyler. \u201cYou\u2019re an agent, for real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then you can see me to my car and follow me for a few miles. I\u2019m going north to a cabin I have up in the woods with some old hunting friends. I\u2019m not sticking around to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe danger seems to be in Philly,\u201d Allison said gently.</p> <p>Standish snorted. \u201cYou know, that guide dying in the late seventies might have been an accident, but the rest of the deaths associated with that place? The kid being electrocuted, the heart attack in Angus\u2019s study. And now...another dead guide and a dead board member? Someone is killing people. And I\u2019m going into hiding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re doing the right thing,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Allison nodded in agreement. Standish gave her copies of the letters and she thanked him again. He locked his place and went into the garage, where he got into a pickup truck with a shotgun on the front seat.</p><p>They followed him for an hour.</p><p>There was a chain hotel on the way as they headed back. Tyler suggested they stop there for the night.</p><p>When they entered their room, he immediately pulled her into his arms.</p><p>She responded with a fiery, passionate kiss, her fingers playing with his waistband and the buckle of his belt. He disarmed himself quickly, fumbling as he unfastened her shirt.</p><p>She pulled back, breathless. \u201cThis case is all...falling into place.... Perhaps we should be more, um, try to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her again, letting out a groan as his naked body came into contact with hers.</p><p>\u201cI am trying to figure it all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re kissing my neck,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYes, and if you keep running your fingers along my spine like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said huskily, taking hold of her face and staring into her eyes. \u201cWhat better way could there be to figure out\u2014\u201d he paused to kiss her \u201c\u2014what was going on in the minds of a pair of lovers...than to be a pair of lovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your logic,\u201d she whispered. And proceeded to show him just how much.</p><p>16</p><p>Tyler had just opened his eyes, feeling the warmth of the morning sun through the motel-room drapes, when his phone began to buzz on the bedside table.</p><p>He scrambled to answer it.</p><p>Logan was calling him. \u201cHey, did I wake you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was waking up. Has something happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Sean thinks he has the solution to the painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He sat up. Beside him, Allison stirred underneath the sheet. He smiled at her, setting a hand on her hip to reassure her that nothing else\u2014like another horrific accident\u2014had taken place.</p><p>\u201cSo what is it?\u201d he asked Logan.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe looked at the painting from every angle with his special lights. Studied it in every way he could without ripping into the canvas\u2014which is just canvas\u2014or taking the whole thing apart. And when he was done, he said he had the answer. There have to be two paintings. Someone has a second painting, and there\u2019s light for the eyes and perhaps some kind of recorder to terrify people or divert their attention. He believes that whoever is doing this somehow manages to switch the paintings.\u201d</p><p>Tyler rubbed his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll hurry back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo rush. Yesterday was uneventful. We went through all the records we could find on the Leigh family\u2014Allison\u2019s branch\u2014and there was no mention anywhere of a baby having been adopted. But there was a son listed as having been born to one of the young Leigh wives in June of 1778, around the time Lucy Tarleton was killed and just before the British evacuated Philly. We can still disinter Lucy and do some DNA testing, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019re right on the money in suspecting that Allison is a descendent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should let Cherry know,\u201d Tyler murmured. Allison was looking at him, and he smiled reassuringly again\u2014or he hoped it was reassuring\u2014but didn\u2019t explain.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you learn?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re discovering there are a lot of holes in the history that\u2019s been taught. We don\u2019t have the whole picture yet, but I do think Lucy was pregnant\u2014and she had Brian Bradley\u2019s child, not Stewart Douglas\u2019s. What we haven\u2019t figured out is who spirited the baby away and who killed Lucy Tarleton. It doesn\u2019t make any sense for Bradley to have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he was afraid of being branded a traitor by the British.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to be cynical, but remember, having an illegitimate child would have been par for the course on the male side, especially for an aristocrat. The female would be branded the whore. If a British officer, who held power in Philadelphia at the time, had a child with a patriot woman, it might\u2019ve been seen as a ho-hum event. Or even a feather in his cap.\u201d</p><p>Allison was frowning at him, but then she smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo one would have thought badly of him. As for Lucy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of which side he was fighting on,\u201d Tyler said, \u201cI believe he was a good soldier and I don\u2019t believe he was a \u2018beast.\u2019 By military standards, it was a sound tactic for the British to take Philly. I see Bradley as a military man. I don\u2019t see him as the kind of man who would kill a woman he loved\u2014a woman who had just borne his child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her lover?\u201d Logan asked. \u201cStewart Douglas.\u201d</p><p>Tyler shook his head. \u201cI doubt she and Stewart Douglas were ever really lovers, although they were likely engaged,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have copies of the letters. I don\u2019t think Stewart Douglas killed her, either, but I don\u2019t know enough about him. By the way, Martin Standish is a good guy\u2014and a scared one. He left his place for a cabin in the woods. He didn\u2019t tell anyone where he\u2019s going except for his daughter, and we saw him out of town. No one followed him,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI\u2019m still uncomfortable with the whole situation, though. The office was trashed and Standish received those strange calls yesterday, the ones from the prepaid cell phone. He\u2019s worried. I\u2019m thinking maybe he has reason to be and we should take some action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you have Allison try to reach him? Maybe she can persuade him to allow a few agents to watch over him up there. I can send Kelsey and Sean. Bring Allison back to the house. By the way, not a ghost has stirred here. Well, except for Julian Mitchell. He\u2019s \u2018keeping guard\u2019 by haunting the entry\u2014and falling asleep on the sofa. That is, when he\u2019s not following Jane around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Allison call Standish right away,\u201d Tyler said, \u201cand then we\u2019ll get something to eat and head back to Philly.\u201d</p><p>He ended the call and as he looked over at Allison, he felt a tremor streak through him. He hadn\u2019t realized how much he\u2019d like waking next to her. Against the hotel\u2019s snow-white sheets, her hair truly was the color of a raven\u2019s wing, so dark it was touched by a cast of blue. Her eyes were as bright and clear as the sky\u2014and seemed as deep as a sun-kissed sea. It wasn\u2019t just that he found her arousing, which he did, but that being with her seemed so right. She was like someone who\u2019d been missing from his life, and even the good relationships he\u2019d had\u2014the relationships, not the casual nights\u2014didn\u2019t compare with the way he felt now. He couldn\u2019t remember not having her beside him and he would never not want her beside him; he didn\u2019t want to envision a morning without seeing her eyes on his when she woke, or feeling her warmth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They really had just met. That seemed to mean nothing. He felt like he\u2019d known her forever...or been waiting to know her forever.</p><p>She was looking at him expectantly, and he asked her to try calling Standish. She nodded and rose, searching for her handbag and her cell phone. She moved so naturally and easily, comfortable with him in her nakedness.</p><p>Yes, he felt like he\u2019d known her forever, but not so long that he didn\u2019t feel an immediate stirring in his groin as he watched her.</p> <p>Sitting on the foot of the bed, she called Standish\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not answering,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tyler leaped out of bed, grabbing his clothes. \u201cCall Logan and get Standish\u2019s daughter\u2019s number. Ask her for a location. And have her check with his cronies up at that cabin and see if he\u2019s just gone out with them. I\u2019m going to find him.\u201d</p><p>Allison quickly did as he asked; meanwhile, Tyler hurried to throw water on his face and run a toothbrush over his teeth.</p><p>He\u2019d just finished when Allison was in the bathroom beside him. \u201cI\u2019m not staying here,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI want to go see if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not leaving me here. It\u2019s not safe, is it?\u201d</p><p>He paused.</p><p>\u201cI can shower later. Logan is calling Standish\u2019s daughter. I\u2019ll be ready by the time we have an address.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, shaking his head slightly. But she was right. She shouldn\u2019t be alone.</p><p>Even if a murderer couldn\u2019t be in more than one place and even if the only person who knew where they were was Logan...</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d he said.</p><p>They were both ready in less than five minutes.</p><p>He was disappointed to leave the room behind.</p><p>There would be no leisurely morning.</p><p>But he found he was more taken with her than ever. When it was time to move, Allison didn\u2019t hesitate.</p><p>As Logan drove, Allison keyed the coordinates of the cabin into the satellite navigator in the car. Logan had gotten the address from Standish\u2019s daughter, who\u2019d been upset but quick to understand and give them the directions. She hadn\u2019t been able to reach her father that morning, either.</p><p>Sean was driving up with Kelsey, but Tyler and Allison would get to the cabin first.</p><p>It was about a thirty-minute drive for them. Tyler could have kicked himself for not realizing yesterday that Martin Standish might prove to be a major target for the killer, who now seemed determined to protect a lie.</p> <p>The countryside was beautiful, rolling hills, forests and farmland. They climbed higher into the foothills; as they neared the cabin, the road grew narrow. A mist settled over the land, soft and lovely\u2014and yet it was the last thing Tyler wanted right then.</p><p>A concealing mist.</p><p>Eventually, they climbed a rough stone path with the car protesting all the way. They\u2019d arrived at the cabin, a small log structure surrounded by trees.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s his truck,\u201d Allison said, pointing out Standish\u2019s small Ford.</p><p>She climbed out of the car. He did the same, drawing his Glock and warning her, \u201cStay behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis killer isn\u2019t going to shoot it out with you. He\u2019s not particularly brave, just devious,\u201d she said, and he was glad of the anger in her voice.</p><p>\u201cStay behind me,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>They walked up to the cabin, with Tyler keeping a keen eye on the woods.</p><p>He banged on the front door. Standish didn\u2019t answer. When he twisted the knob, the door opened and they went in.</p><p>It was just a small cabin, consisting of two rooms and a bath. There was a coffeepot on the counter; it was still hot.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d Tyler said, stating the obvious.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s his cell phone.\u201d Allison pointed to a rough-hewn table by an old wingback chair in front of a wood-burning stove.</p><p>\u201cSo he made coffee and walked out of the cabin, leaving his cell phone behind. He doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of man who has to have it every second, so maybe that\u2019s not unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he went fishing,\u201d Allison said hopefully. \u201cLots of streams in this area. And these guys come up here to go hunting. I don\u2019t see his rifle, and I didn\u2019t see it on the rack of his pickup truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not fishing,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cHe left because he heard something outside. He took the rifle with him.\u201d He strode back to the door. There\u2019d been some rain in the area recently, and he could make out what might be Standish\u2019s footprints leading into the copse of trees to the rear of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cStay close!\u201d he told Allison.</p><p>She followed him as they moved into the woods. The mist that hovered in the foothills grew thicker, and the sun couldn\u2019t cut through the high canopy of pines. It felt as if they were in a realm of shadow where the pines could come to life and the low-hanging branches could reach out like fingers to snare the unwary.</p><p>\u201cAllison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m close,\u201d she said, crashing into him as he stopped.</p><p>He nodded and kept going. He could hear a brook and they walked toward it. He paused every so often, listening. There was no breeze so the mist seemed stagnant; they heard only minor rustling when small forest denizens scurried about. Still, he found himself moving very carefully. He suddenly felt certain that someone with malicious purpose had been there, and recently. Whether that someone had fled or not, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>As they neared the little stream, he heard Allison cry out. \u201cThere! Oh, Tyler, there he is!\u201d</p><p>She rushed around him and he chased after her, instinctively searching the perimeter. He could see no one.</p><p>Allison was already in the stream and down on her knees by the fallen form of Martin Standish. He was headfirst in the water, and she rolled him over.</p><p>She leaned against him. \u201cHe\u2019s not breathing, Tyler!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall 9-1-1. Get them out here as fast as possible.\u201d</p><p>He hunkered down, checking Standish for visible wounds. Despite the icy water of the stream, he was still warm. Tyler pulled him from the rippling water onto the shore and started performing CPR, counting as he listened to Allison make the call.</p><p>She knelt down on Martin\u2019s other side to help. Tyler instructed her, breathing into Standish\u2019s mouth as she held his nose, and he applied pressure to the man\u2019s chest, counting.</p><p>He was about to give up. They\u2019d tried long and hard, and he was afraid he\u2019d broken one of Martin\u2019s ribs despite his best efforts to exert pressure at the perfect level.</p><p>Then Standish breathed. He gulped in a huge swallow of air and began coughing violently.</p><p>Allison looked up at Tyler. \u201cHe...he might make it!\u201d</p><p>Tyler nodded, feeling for the man\u2019s pulse. It was faint and irregular, but it was there. He ripped off his jacket, covering him.</p><p>Standish opened his eyes. He stared at Tyler and Allison, and seemed to recognize them.</p><p>\u201cVoices,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cThere were voices in the woods...ghosts. There were ghosts in the woods.\u201d</p><p>His eyes closed. Allison and Tyler frowned at each other.</p><p>Tyler wanted to search the woods, but he wasn\u2019t leaving Standish and Allison alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe wait,\u201d he said. He pulled out his cell phone to call Sean first and then Logan.</p><p>Allison watched him, her blue eyes grave. Then she looked out at the surrounding trees. \u201cThis just happened, Tyler,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t come when we did, he would have drowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may still have a long haul ahead of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoices in the woods,\u201d she repeated. \u201cGhosts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were no ghosts in the woods,\u201d Tyler said, gritting his teeth.</p><p>\u201cListen!\u201d she said.</p><p>He heard it. From somewhere down in the rugged terrain of the foothills, a motor was being revved.</p><p>\u201cWhoever it was took a different path,\u201d he said, feeling angrier.</p><p>They never should have left Standish.</p><p>It seemed like forever before he heard Sean shouting for them. He and Kelsey came bursting through to the stream, armed and wary.</p><p>\u201cOver here!\u201d Allison called, although they\u2019d been seen.</p><p>Tyler rose. \u201cEMTs should be here any moment,\u201d he said. \u201cKelsey, stay with them. Sean, I\u2019m pretty sure our killer has fled, but I want to get into the woods.\u201d</p><p>Kelsey crouched down by Martin Standish and Allison. Tyler, with Sean flanking him, walked back into the woods.</p><p>The mist lay everywhere among the trees.</p><p>But someone had come here. Someone who knew about Martin Standish and had been interested enough to learn his habits\u2014and where he spent his leisure time. Someone who\u2019d been watching the activity at the Tarleton-Dandridge House and had known, or surmised, that he and Allison had come to see Standish.</p><p>Tyler walked through the woods, away from the cabin, calling out to Sean, who was following the same path but thirty feet closer to the main road below. When he was near the edge, he came across a pine with a large broken branch. He dropped down to the earth and he could see the dirt and needles that had been disturbed. Just beyond the broken branch, the forest began to dwindle and an overgrown embankment led down to the road.</p><p>Their quarry had indeed fled.</p><p>He saw Sean break through the trees.</p><p>\u201cHe was here,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Sean joined him. \u201cFind anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out how he got away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid Standish say anything? Did he see anything?\u201d Sean asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, voices in the woods. Ghosts in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy is using technical devices,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI believe he has a copy of the Beast Bradley painting, and he substitutes it for the other when he\u2019s stalking his prey. He has some kind of mechanism to throw his voice. I\u2019ll bet he lured Standish to the water that way. He\u2019s not stupid\u2014Standish had a shotgun. If we\u2019re lucky, our guy dropped something. I\u2019ll have Logan see if we can get a crime scene unit to go through these woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll need a unit. It\u2019s almost impossible to see in here with the canopy of branches and the mist.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sean rested a hand on his shoulder. \u201cWe can\u2019t protect everyone who ever walked into the Tarleton-Dandridge House,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tyler couldn\u2019t shake his anger with himself. \u201cI should have known. Hell, someone called him three times, and he felt enough anxiety to head out. He said no one knew where he was going except for his daughter, but...this person knows the area, Sean. This is someone who\u2019s read everything that\u2019s been written about the house. The board and the other guides were aware that Allison was working on a paper\u2014and that she\u2019d studied what Standish wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTyler, quit beating yourself up. We couldn\u2019t have known that Standish would be in danger. And it looks like you got to him in time,\u201d Sean told him.</p> <p>\u201cBarely, and I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll make it. He\u2019s not a young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll make it,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI can hear the sirens now.\u201d</p><p>Allison stepped aside when the EMTs arrived with their medical bags and stretcher. She looked on as they set up an IV and took Standish\u2019s vital signs.</p><p>\u201cCPR?\u201d one of the young men asked her.</p><p>\u201cYes, he wasn\u2019t breathing at first.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas he spoken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly.\u201d</p><p>The EMTs didn\u2019t care about voices or ghosts in the woods; their only concern was for the injured man.</p><p>\u201cHe was in the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Facedown. We don\u2019t know how he got there, if he was injured, tripped\u2014pushed. We don\u2019t know,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>She watched, stricken, while the team worked on Standish. Then one of them glanced up at her and smiled.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an EMT, not a doc. But I think he\u2019s going to be okay. Thank God you came along when you did.\u201d</p><p>She smiled back weakly.</p><p>It was a shame she\u2019d ever contacted the man. She\u2019d unwittingly put him in danger.</p><p>Sean and Tyler returned from the woods, their expressions grim, as Standish was placed on a stretcher. It was decided that Kelsey and Sean would go to the hospital and guard Martin Standish there. Logan seemed to think it was important that Allison be at the house.</p><p>She and Tyler waited, standing by the beautiful little bubbling stream, as the EMTs moved out. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d Allison couldn\u2019t help saying.</p><p>Tyler shook his head. \u201cNo. I was the fool,\u201d he said harshly. \u201cI should\u2019ve had someone watching him from the minute we found out about the missing article.\u201d</p><p>Allison was afraid that he felt his interest in her might be keeping him from making the best judgments.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand. If I hadn\u2019t gotten it into my head to publish another paper on the house, maybe none of this would have happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAllison, it\u2019s no one else\u2019s fault when someone commits murder. It\u2019s the work of the bastard who believes his life or agenda is greater than the lives of anyone else. And I don\u2019t think the killing started with your paper. I think it started before. Obviously, no one living now was responsible for the death of a Civil War soldier or the suicide of a distraught young woman\u2014things that took place years ago\u2014but as to the kid who was electrocuted, and the guide who had a heart attack in Angus\u2019s study...I think we may be looking at the same perpetrator.\u201d He turned away suddenly, and she realized he\u2019d heard movement from the trees.</p><p>\u201cCrime scene techs are here,\u201d he said. He walked away to greet the team, and she could hear him explaining the situation succinctly, including a chronicle of the actions they\u2019d taken since they\u2019d come.</p><p>Allison walked closer to the stream. She stared down at the water. It seemed to glitter. As the water skipped over pebbles and rocks, it reflected rays of sunshine, which shone like scattered diamonds.</p><p>Something caught her eye and she cried out.</p><p>Tyler spun around, his face anxious.</p><p>\u201cI see Standish\u2019s rifle,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2014it looks as if he threw it. As if he was hit from behind, and then threw it.\u201d</p><p>Tyler and the crew of techs walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cGood eye,\u201d one of the techs said.</p><p>He sloshed through the stream to collect the rifle and then glanced at Tyler. \u201cWe\u2019ll comb this part of the woods,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get back to you with anything we have, down to gum wrappers if there are any.\u201d</p><p>Tyler thanked him, then led Allison back through the woods to his car, parked in front of the cabin. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to Philly,\u201d he said.</p><p>She was hesitant as they drove. \u201cTyler, maybe I should go away. People around me, even people I hardly know, seem to wind up dead or in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Go back to your house? No. Don\u2019t you see, Allison? That would mean one or two of us having to patrol your house to make sure no one\u2019s figured out a way to break in. Besides, you\u2019ve been around all these people for years. Any one of our suspects could have a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant fly away somewhere,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIf that would keep you safe, I\u2019d have you do it in a second. But this person is a step ahead. He\u2019d find you, Allison. He\u2019d go after you. He found Standish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel that...\u201d</p><p>He reached out, squeezing her hand. \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cBut we need you where you are. I need you with me\u2014where I know I can keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at that. \u201cI like being...safe,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut I can\u2019t stop feeling that I\u2019m a catalyst for others being hurt. And killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will solve this is finding out the who. That will prevent more people from being hurt or killed. I think we\u2019re just about onto the why. Our killer knows that, and it\u2019s making him desperate. And when a killer gets desperate, he gets careless.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in the passenger seat, closing her eyes.</p><p>When they were a little more than halfway back to the city, Tyler\u2019s phone rang. He asked her to pick it up.</p><p>It was Sean, and she put the phone on speaker.</p><p>They both listened as Sean told them that Martin Standish was going to make it. \u201cHe\u2019s conscious again and clear in his mind. He was knocked out by a massive blow to the head. He would have drowned if you two hadn\u2019t come along when you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so thankful we did,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to have some tests done because it was a pretty nasty blow,\u201d Sean continued. \u201cHe says he heard voices calling to him from the woods. At first he was afraid it might have been his daughter, that she\u2019d come up and gotten lost and was wandering through the woods. Then he heard voices that seemed to come from a number of directions. As if the woods were filled with ghosts. He heard another noise and got angry, so he followed it to the stream, thinking he\u2019d be safe. The man is good with a shotgun, from what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cThe next thing he knew, he felt a sharp pain against his skull, and he fell into the water. That\u2019s the last he remembered\u2014until he felt Allison \u2018kissing\u2019 him,\u201d Sean said.</p><p>Tyler smiled. \u201cThat must\u2019ve been nice for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, the guy has quite a sense of humor for an old coot. You\u2019re not going to believe this. He\u2019s still in pain, but he seems happy now. He says someone\u2019s finally paying attention to him, and he thinks his research is going to change history.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will\u2014but only in our small corner of the world,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Kelsey and I will hang out here,\u201d Sean finished. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge hospital and their security is pretty flimsy. One of us will be in his room at all times. And could you look for that other painting?\u201d he asked. \u201cI know it exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do that,\u201d Tyler promised.</p><p>When they reached the Tarleton-Dandridge, Kat was at the morgue, going through the autopsy reports on everyone who\u2019d died at the house.</p><p>Jane and Logan were in the salon, where the antique dining table had been turned into a workstation. Julian was with them, trying to move a piece of paper.</p><p>He stood, relieved to see Allison. He tried to give her a hug.</p><p>She tried to hug him in return. With limited success.</p><p>Then she went to take a quick shower and Tyler planned to do the same as soon as she was out.</p><p>Logan listened to his report on what they\u2019d discovered, then said he was going to keep searching through the records they\u2019d amassed. \u201cI think you should give Detective Jenson a call. The local police were going to keep tabs on Oxford, Addison, Pierson, Fanning and Lawrence.\u201d</p><p>Tyler agreed and made the call. Jenson told him, \u201cOxford left his house in the ten minutes between my patrol car\u2019s drive-by. Lawrence\u2019s car hasn\u2019t moved. No one\u2019s seen anyone come or go from the Addison house. Pierson had a meeting at a bank downtown. He left his place about twenty minutes ago.\u201d Jenson paused. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how much any of that will help you.\u201d</p><p>Tyler thanked him, saying, \u201cIt helps.\u201d He related everything about the trip he and Allison had taken to see Martin Standish and what had happened that morning.</p><p>\u201cI can double the patrol,\u201d Jenson said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard. We\u2019re not allowed overtime with the current budget cuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate whatever you can do.\u201d</p><p>It was growing late. Logan ordered food. When Allison was done with the shower, Tyler went in. The hot water felt wonderful; he hadn\u2019t realized how cramped and stiff he was from getting soaked in the cold stream. Fortunately, the water stayed hot just long enough.... When he came out, he felt invigorated.</p><p>He knew Allison was with Logan and Jane. Logan was questioning her, once again, about the people she\u2019d worked with at the house.</p><p>He went back to the entry and sat down at the bank of screens, rolling through the images quickly to watch the hours since they\u2019d left.</p><p>Late in the middle of the night, Lucy Tarleton had appeared. She\u2019d gone to the study and looked in, then hurried through the house to the back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wondered if, night after night, she repeated that same circuit. If so, he assumed it meant she was sneaking out of the house, heading over to the stables to get Firewalker and take off into the night, carrying her information to the patriots at Valley Forge.</p><p>There had been no other activity.</p><p>He felt a touch on his shoulder. \u201cGive it a rest,\u201d Logan said. \u201cStart over in the morning. Standish survived and he has two of the best guards around. Get some sleep.\u201d</p> <p>Tyler nodded. \u201cThanks,\u201d he told Logan huskily.</p><p>Allison was already upstairs in Lucy\u2019s room. He found her in bed, wide-eyed and waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cShould I be here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Tyler felt the day\u2019s tension, his own self-reproach, fall away as if he\u2019d shed an irritating coat. She had that effect on him. It wasn\u2019t that she made him forget; she made him see more clearly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful you are,\u201d he said, \u201cand there\u2019s nowhere else I think you should be.\u201d</p> <p>He stripped off his clothing and lay down beside her. He touched her hair softly, looking into the deep blue of her eyes, getting lost in them. \u201cSo, the last man you were seeing was something of a rock star, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a while ago now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood guy, nice guy, but for the longest time, I thought there was something wrong with me. He\u2019d plan to pick me up and wouldn\u2019t show. At that point I knew about the alcohol but not about the drugs. Later on, I went to a few Narcotics Anonymous meetings. And I knew he cared about me, but he refused to acknowledge the addictions. I ended the relationship. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing now. I pray he\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing, addiction,\u201d he told her, drawing her close.</p><p>She lay against him for a minute in silence, a silence that seemed relaxed and comfortable. Pulling her closer he kissed the top of her head.</p> <p>She stirred, and he kissed her again. He felt her naked body slide against his, and her slightest touch was instant arousal.</p><p>He loved the fact that she could make the world go away. And that she could so easily return to it. He found himself wondering if she\u2019d ever leave her beloved Philadelphia. Virginia wasn\u2019t that far, but...</p><p>He forgot the past and future as they made love.</p><p>And then they slept peacefully together.</p><p>In the middle of the night, he felt her move. He woke as she slipped out from the covers and stood there for a moment, framed in the pale moonlight that filtered through the drapes.</p><p>She walked away from him. Tyler rose quickly, watching her; she wasn\u2019t awake, he thought. She wasn\u2019t aware of him.</p><p>For a few seconds he was afraid she\u2019d take off through the night stark naked. She didn\u2019t. She went to the foot of the bed and pulled on her robe, although she didn\u2019t bother with slippers. She hurried across the room to the wall where there was nothing\u2014nothing that he could see. She bent to pick up something, cradling it tenderly against her body. She paused, head bent, as if she was praying, and then hurried to the door.</p><p>He grabbed his own robe, throwing it on. Allison opened the door and eased through. In the hallway she paused again, as if listening for others in the household.</p> <p>She walked carefully down the stairs and went to stand in the entrance to the study, looking into the darkened room. Then she ran down the hallway to the back door. The alarm was keyed; she wasn\u2019t going to stop to put in the code.</p><p>He realized that to Allison, at that moment, there was no code. She was seeing the house through the memory of another woman.</p><p>Lucy Tarleton.</p><p>He slipped ahead of her, tapping in the alarm code just in time. Allison opened the back door and stepped into the night.</p><p>She moved forward and handed whatever she was carrying to someone who was invisible to him.</p><p>A second later she stepped back, tears in her eyes.</p><p>Tyler felt as if a rush of wind swept by him.</p><p>Then Allison burst into tears and sank to the ground.</p><p>17</p><p>By then, the others were up. Tyler bent down beside Allison, drawing her to her feet. He brought an arm around her.</p><p>\u201cShe gave the baby away. She carried her baby out in the middle of the night and she gave him away,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cI know. I saw,\u201d Tyler told her.</p><p>She looked baffled. \u201cIt\u2019s true. It\u2019s really true. She gave the baby to the Leigh family, my family, and all these years, none of us had any idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs we\u2019ve said many times, history is always told by the victors,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cI suppose Lucy\u2019s patriot family didn\u2019t want it known she\u2019d had a bastard child\u2014especially since the baby\u2019s father was one of the enemy. It ruined the romance and drama of her heroism in their eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about Bradley? He must have known. Do you think that\u2019s what sent him into a frenzy\u2014why he killed her?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, let\u2019s get inside. It\u2019s cold out here,\u201d Jane said.</p><p>Kat was just inside the door. \u201cDo you suppose that\u2019s why people have been killed through the years?\u201d she asked. \u201cI studied those autopsy reports inside and out. The deaths look like they were accidental, but...faulty wiring caused the college student\u2019s death? At a historic property that\u2019s inspected all the time? Or tripping down the stairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould this be the reason?\u201d Tyler gestured at Allison. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking for a truly obsessed killer who is devious, as well. And if\u2014\u201d He paused, aware that everyone was watching him. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s because Allison really is a descendent of Lucy Tarleton, she\u2019s the one who matters. That would point to Cherry Addison. Not to mention the fact that her husband is an artist and she could have gotten him to paint a replica portrait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we announce tomorrow that we suspect Allison Leigh is a descendent of Lucy Tarleton\u2019s,\u201d Logan said. \u201cWe make an announcement to the media\u2014and see what crawls out of the woodwork.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill that make the killer more desperate?\u201d Jane asked. \u201cOr will it just mean that the truth is out\u2014and he\u2019ll disappear and we\u2019ll never know who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should make the announcement to the surviving guides and board members first,\u201d Kat suggested.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tyler agreed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll set it up for tomorrow night,\u201d Logan said. \u201cDuring the day, we need to watch the board. Whoever was in the woods with Martin Standish is going to want to know if he survived or not. I left word with the hospital to report his condition as critical. We\u2019ll keep an eye on the board\u2014and on Jason and Annette\u2014and plan on having them over for after-dinner coffee. We\u2019ll present this information to them and see what kind of reaction we get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the motive,\u201d Allison said, wiping her face. She shrugged. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t believe people were killed because of Lucy\u2019s baby. There\u2019s another possible spin to this story. Maybe the baby wasn\u2019t Beast Bradley\u2019s child, but Stewart Douglas\u2019s. I can\u2019t tell anyone, other than you, that I saw and acted out what happened the night Lucy gave her baby away. She sensed danger in the house. If she was afraid Beast Bradley would kill not just her but the child, as well, that would make her actions more heroic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the only person who might be distressed by the evidence that Lucy did have an illegitimate child would be...Cherry,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s not the reason for the murders, what is?\u201d Tyler asked, frustrated.</p><p>\u201cI say we tell the world we\u2019re going to have Lucy disinterred so we can do DNA tests on her and Allison, and prove it to all and sundry,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see how Cherry takes the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t really have to dig her up, do we?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019ll be your choice in the end,\u201d Logan told her. \u201cFor the moment, it\u2019s a carrot...dangled in someone\u2019s face.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIf you\u2019re game to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m game for anything at this point.\u201d</p><p>Julian had been standing by Jane. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI need to know the truth, Allison. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone, and I don\u2019t want anyone else hurt. I don\u2019t know exactly what it is, but I need...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustice,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe seek justice. For the living\u2014and the dead.\u201d</p><p>Allison was nervous the next morning but she called Jason Lawrence and Annette Fanning while Logan phoned Cherry, Ethan Oxford and Nathan Pierson. They explained that they were going to talk to those most closely associated with the house before giving new information to the press. Annette and Jason both sounded curious and nothing more.</p><p>Tyler suggested they go to the hospital and check on Artie Dixon\u2019s condition. Tyler sent Jane and Kat on a drive out to Valley Forge to meet with local police\u2014and to check that nothing at Martin Standish\u2019s little museum had been touched.</p><p>At the hospital, Haley Dixon looked more worn than ever. Once again, Tyler coaxed her into coming to the cafeteria with him, while Allison sat down and held Dixon\u2019s hand.</p><p>A young woman poked her head in and introduced herself as Dixon\u2019s nurse for the day, telling her the LPN\u2019s name was on the board, if she needed assistance. \u201cWe monitor the vitals at all times, of course, out at the nurses\u2019 station, but hit the button if you need us.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ve had all kinds of codes going today\u2014reds and greens. Those are hostile or combative patients. You wouldn\u2019t believe how many people come in for help and then want to knock out their doctors and nurses!\u201d</p><p>Allison smiled sympathetically and thanked her. As she sat down, she heard the warning, \u201cCode green!\u201d over the loudspeaker. Nurses and orderlies were running down the hall.</p><p>Allison concentrated on Artie Dixon, talking to him quietly and earnestly, asking him to speak to her with his mind. He did, but he was still obsessed with the painting. \u201cLies\u2014what we see is all lies,\u201d Dixon told her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe believe there are two paintings, Mr. Dixon. And one of them is a false image, used to distract or perhaps hypnotize the watcher. Someone changes the painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dixon seemed to whisper. \u201cThe painting. I believe it is false. I believe it\u2019s all lies.\u201d</p><p>A nurse came into the room. At first, Allison was so intent on Artie Dixon that she didn\u2019t pay attention. Then, as the person in the scrubs began to flick a needle of medication to insert in the IV, Allison noticed that the nurse was wearing a cap and had a large air mask over his or her face.</p> <p>A feeling of unease crept over her.</p><p>She rose abruptly. The nurses didn\u2019t usually come in dressed as if they were entering a surgery or intensive care.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She screamed when the \u201cnurse\u201d turned, the needle raised\u2014ready to shove it in her chest.</p><p>Allison panicked and pushed at the bed. It was heavy, but she pushed it far enough to catch the person in the thighs.</p> <p>\u201cHelp!\u201d she screamed at the top of her lungs.</p><p>The hospital seemed eerily silent.</p><p>The \u201cnurse\u201d was regaining his or her balance, but Allison had nothing with which to fight\u2014other than her handbag. She slammed it across her would-be attacker\u2019s face and flew out into the hall.</p><p>The hall was empty. She could hear her attacker, heavy-footed, coming after her as the loudspeaker announced, \u201cCode Red, Code Green. Code Red, Code Green, Neuro Section twelve!\u201d</p><p>There was no one else around because they were all answering the code calls. And Allison had a feeling that those calls were rigged.</p><p>She paused in the hall. Which way? Where should she go?</p> <p>She started toward the elevators and then turned back; the person in the surgical garb was standing outside the room, dripping needle held high in a gloved hand.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what was in the needle.</p><p>She was sure it was lethal.</p><p>She ran toward the elevators, aware that the person was running behind her.</p><p>Allison reached the elevator bank and slammed all the buttons. She didn\u2019t care if she went up or down\u2014just so long as she could go somewhere.</p><p>She turned back. Her attacker was gaining on her.</p><p>She slammed the buttons again. An elevator door opened.</p><p>And Tyler stepped out. She threw herself in his arms, hysterically trying to explain that someone was behind her.</p> <p>\u201cWhere, Allison, where?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cArtie!\u201d Mrs. Dixon, who was beside him, cried out.</p><p>Allison swung around. There was no one behind her, no one at all.</p><p>Tyler didn\u2019t doubt Allison\u2019s word. He contacted a guard and had the hospital locked down, but he knew full well that in a hospital, it was easy for someone clad in the right uniform to simply disappear\u2014hiding in plain sight.</p><p>And Allison, try as she might, couldn\u2019t describe her assailant. \u201cTall, I think. Maybe not, but at least my height,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if it was a man or woman,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Artie Dixon was fortunately unharmed. Tyler made arrangements with Jenson to send local officers to watch over his room from that point on. Haley Dixon remained hysterical for a long time after the incident and had to be sedated.</p><p>Security officers and police who had gone through the hospital reported to Tyler that they\u2019d found no one answering the description hiding in lounges or in patients\u2019 bathrooms.</p><p>Tyler hadn\u2019t expected they would. The moment he\u2019d stepped off the elevator, the perpetrator had been managing his or her escape. Strip off the cap and mask, walk calmly and briskly into a patient\u2019s room, perhaps even direct a cop to a different location. Slide out of the uniform and walk out like a visitor.</p><p>When they were finally leaving, he heard Allison gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnette! There\u2019s Annette.\u201d</p><p>Annette Fanning was hurrying through the parking lot to her car. Allison touched Tyler\u2019s arm. \u201cLet me see what she says when I catch up with her. I want to see her reaction to me being here. But Annette can\u2019t be our killer. Really, it can\u2019t be Annette.\u201d</p><p>Allison ran ahead of him. He slowed his pace, watching carefully. Allison caught up with Annette, and the other woman turned to her, a look of surprise on her face.</p><p>\u201cHey! My God, I\u2019m glad to see you. I don\u2019t know what was going on here, but I came to see my cousin in the maternity ward. And suddenly there were bells and bongs and security and cops all over.\u201d</p><p>Tyler could hear Annette speaking; he could also tell that she was reaching into her oversize handbag for something.</p><p>A needle? The needle she\u2019d failed to thrust into Allison in Artie Dixon\u2019s hospital room?</p><p>No more taking chances.</p><p>Tyler sped across the parking lot and tackled Annette Fanning. He slammed into her, twisting so he didn\u2019t throw her onto the pavement but took that punishment himself.</p><p>Annette cried out. Tyler rolled, pulling her to her feet. He grabbed the bag from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Annette demanded angrily.</p><p>\u201cTyler?\u201d Allison said, as if she, too, thought he had lost his mind.</p><p>He ignored them both and searched Annette\u2019s bag. There was nothing in it more incriminating than a hairbrush and a box of tampons.</p><p>He thrust the bag back at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your cousin\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudy Hall, and she had a baby girl last night at 10:03,\u201d Annette told him. \u201cCheck it out!\u201d she added angrily.</p><p>\u201cWe will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you people?\u201d Annette shouted.</p><p>\u201cAllison was just attacked. In Artie Dixon\u2019s room,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Annette gasped. \u201cAnd you think that I\u2014that I... Don\u2019t be absurd! It couldn\u2019t have been me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should we infer that it couldn\u2019t have been you?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, because Allison is way stronger than I am!\u201d Annette said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Allison agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need much strength to shove a needle into someone.\u201d Tyler shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m done taking chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it wasn\u2019t Annette\u2014I know it wasn\u2019t Annette,\u201d Allison said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just assume,\u201d Tyler began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not assuming on the basis of friendship. But the attacker was taller. Annette\u2019s too small.\u201d</p><p>Annette groaned. \u201cThanks. Thanks a hell of a lot!\u201d</p><p>When Allison and Tyler returned, Logan was alone in the house. He was seated in front of the screens, glancing at them now and then, and going over papers and folders, eternally patient while he searched for what he wanted.</p><p>He knew what had happened because Tyler had spoken to him.</p><p>\u201cJane and Kat are with the police at Valley Forge,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was an attempt to break into Martin Standish\u2019s house last night. With Standish\u2019s blessing, they\u2019re transferring some of his papers to a bank vault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Allison said. \u201cAre we still expecting the others tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cIncluding Annette.\u201d Tyler grimaced. His apology had been minimal, and Allison felt guilty, since they hadn\u2019t really learned anything from the encounter. So Annette\u2019s distress had been for nothing. Tyler had told Allison they couldn\u2019t afford to take any chances, and she understood that, but...</p><p>She looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Julian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went with Jane and Kat. He\u2019s decided you don\u2019t need him\u2014and they might,\u201d Logan said, smiling. \u201cWhat a pity they met at completely the wrong time! He\u2019s so courteous toward Jane, and while she pretends he\u2019s a pest, she really likes him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, talk about the ultimate bad timing,\u201d Allison murmured.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Both Logan and Tyler turned to her. \u201cWith everything that happened, I forgot to tell Tyler what Artie \u2018said\u2019 to me. I don\u2019t think he was denying there could be a second painting, but he wanted me to understand something about the painting in the study. He kept saying it was a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he means the painting itself is a lie,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe know that when Tobias Dandridge painted it, he despised Bradley. Bradley and the British troops had left Philadelphia. Tobias was probably feeling a bit inadequate, since the Colonial forces didn\u2019t defeat the British here. The British abandoned the capital just as the patriots had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting. The history of the house and the family came down to us through Tobias Dandridge and his wife, Sophia,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cLucy\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he painted the picture of Bradley as a monster and left that image of him for the world.\u201d Allison sighed. \u201cAnd now we know it\u2019s probably unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go look,\u201d Tyler suggested. \u201cSee if we can find the second painting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...say there is such a painting,\u201d Allison said, \u201cwould the killer leave it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but maybe we\u2019ll find a clue as to whether or not it actually exists.\u201d</p><p>Logan checked his watch. \u201cYou have about an hour,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get on with it,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Allison thought they should trace the path someone might take through the house and discover how easy it would be to slip from the study to other rooms\u2014and then leave the property entirely. As they moved through the study into the ladies\u2019 salon and the music room, she could see how someone could have crept through the various rooms without being seen by her, the lone remaining guide, on the night Julian was killed. The house alarms didn\u2019t extend to the fence in front of the property or the wall that surrounded it.</p><p>She opened every cabinet and every drawer, looking for a place where a painting might have been hidden. They didn\u2019t find one, but toward the end of their search, Allison opened a cupboard where musical instruments had been kept during the Revolutionary era. It still contained a couple of fifes, carefully displayed on shelves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait!\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>She\u2019d been about to close the door.

They turned to see what he wanted.</p><p>\u201cShowtime!\u201d he announced. \u201cThey\u2019re arriving.\u201d</p> <p>Allison followed Tyler out to the narrow hall and down to the entry. Ethan leaned on his cane, Cherry stood next to him and Nathan was just coming in. She walked forward to welcome them all, her heart beating fast, but behaving as naturally as she could.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s adjourn to the grand salon, shall we?\u201d Logan invited. \u201cWe can sit around the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh!\u201d Cherry said with dismay. \u201cLook what you\u2019ve done to this table! It\u2019s over two-hundred years old, you know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s covered with a plastic tarp that lets nothing through,\u201d Logan reassured her. \u201cNot to worry. Please, have a seat. Coffee, tea\u2014anything?\u201d</p><p>They heard a key in the door. \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d Jason called from the entry.</p><p>\u201cThis way!\u201d Tyler called back.</p> <p>\u201cEthan, I just don\u2019t know if it was such a good idea, bringing this unit in. Sorry, you all, but really. You people don\u2019t seem to have any answers,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>\u201cThis will be solved.\u201d Ethan spoke in a low, confident voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious. Evidently, you\u2019ve discovered something,\u201d Nathan said cheerfully. \u201cI, for one, am agog to hear!\u201d</p><p>Annette arrived just after Jason. She acted as if she didn\u2019t want to be in the house; she was hostile and whispered to Allison, \u201cI\u2019m not coming back to work here. I don\u2019t want to wind up like Julian or Sarah. And I don\u2019t want to be accused of hurting anyone, either!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah had an accident,\u201d Cherry murmured.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019re all present... If you\u2019ll sit down, we\u2019ll tell you what we believe we can prove,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>He remained standing while the others took chairs. \u201cFirst,\u201d he began, \u201ctake a look at these likenesses.\u201d</p><p>He passed out copies of the computer images Jane had devised, melding Allison\u2019s face with the images of Lucy Tarleton.</p> <p>Annette let out a little gasp. She stared across the table at Allison. \u201cOh, my God! That is uncanny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t think it\u2019s uncanny. We think its heredity,\u201d Logan said evenly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d Cherry snapped. \u201cLucy didn\u2019t have children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe she did, and we can prove it,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cWe want to do DNA testing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cherry gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Cool!\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know... Disturbing the dead?\u201d Ethan asked haltingly. \u201cI need to speak with Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may do that, of course, Mr. Oxford,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he had to go back to D.C. yesterday, but you can call him, and of course, we\u2019ll bring him out again. We\u2019ve concluded that someone is afraid of the discovery that Lucy did bear an illegitimate child. That someone is so obsessed with history, he or she doesn\u2019t want the truth known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a possible descendent?\u201d Nathan asked. \u201cBut...that\u2019s not logical, is it? That makes the story all the more appealing! It means we have a flesh-and-blood replica of our beautiful Lucy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Cherry protested. \u201cJust because you can play with a computer and make Allison look like Lucy? I repeat\u2014ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the only aspect of our theory, Cherry,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cMartin Standish has letters in a safety deposit box that appear to have been written by Lucy. Reading between the lines, they indicate she was never in love with Stewart Douglas, that they were very good friends, and there was no reason for either Stewart Douglas or Brian Bradley to have killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, someone killed her. She ended up very dead!\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019ll find a way to do the DNA testing.\u201d Logan cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many of you are aware of this, but Allison was attacked at the hospital today. Someone dressed up in hospital scrubs came after her with a needle. A lethal dose of some kind of drug, I\u2019m sure. So, where were you all today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cherry demanded, rising.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re accusing us?\u201d Nathan burst out.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Tyler said, sitting on the edge of the table, \u201cwe know it\u2019s one of you. It has to be. We just have to figure out which. You\u2019re the only ones who know the house well enough. So, if we can trace your movements today?\u201d</p><p>Jason raised his hand. \u201cHey, call Evan McDooley! I was working all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already been accused,\u201d Annette said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m too short!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous,\u201d Cherry muttered again. \u201cFire them, Ethan. Get rid of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCherry, you do stand to lose the most, you know,\u201d Tyler said in a reasonable voice. \u201cNo longer being the star of the history center\u2014I mean, hey, a real live descendent of Lucy Tarleton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what a murder is committed for!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not, is it, Cherry?\u201d Tyler asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom,\u201d Annette said abruptly. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse me.\u201d</p><p>She got up to leave the room but asked, \u201cDo I need a guard?\u201d</p><p>No one spoke and she headed toward the back.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Tyler asked. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in my house all day. My housekeeper can vouch for me,\u201d Ethan said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cStockbroker and business,\u201d Nathan said.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. I was at the gallery,\u201d Cherry said.</p><p>As Cherry\u2019s words died, they suddenly heard a high-pitched scream. Annette was yelling in a panicked voice. \u201cHelp, help! Oh, my God!\u201d</p><p>Allison jumped up, ready to run. Tyler was ahead of her, thrusting her behind him as Logan dashed toward the rear of the house, the others following him.</p><p>Allison slammed into Tyler when he stopped at the door to the bathroom. \u201cIt bit me!\u201d Annette screamed. \u201cIt bit me!\u201d</p><p>Logan dialed 9-1-1; Tyler stepped past him.</p><p>There was a copperhead coiled behind the trash basket. As it started to strike again, Tyler pulled his Glock and shot the snake, then crouched down by Annette.</p><p>It was while he bent to minister to her that Allison felt the pinprick in her leg. She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came. She felt someone\u2019s arms around her, dragging her back. She tried to blink to see clearly; Logan and Tyler were involved with Annette. She saw Cherry\u2019s face, filled with concern. Jason Lawrence had knelt down beside Annette.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see Ethan Oxford or Nathan Pierson.</p><p>But she knew one of them was behind her. He\u2019d drugged her and was dragging her away, and she couldn\u2019t speak or blink, and soon, everything was black.</p><p>18</p><p>The snake had been a fairly small copperhead, but Tyler didn\u2019t believe for a minute that it had just made its way into the house\u2014any more than a copperhead had just made its way into Sarah Vining\u2019s car.</p><p>He knew the emergency crew would arrive shortly, but he fastened a tourniquet created from Jason\u2019s tie beneath Annette\u2019s knee.</p><p>She was crying and screaming all the while, and he knew the others were rushing around, trying to get her water, trying to help.</p><p>With the tourniquet in place, he looked at the wound; there was no need to try sucking out the poison and spitting it out himself. The EMTs would deal with it much more efficiently than he could ever manage. Copperhead bites were common enough in the area.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to die!\u201d Annette cried.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die. Put your arms around my neck. I\u2019ll carry you out to the sofa. When the EMTs get here, they\u2019ll give you an antidote. You\u2019ll spend the night in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Cherry Addison came running up, her high heels clicking away, as he brought Annette to the sofa. Logan was still on the line with the 9-1-1 operator, taking her directions and nodding to Tyler that he\u2019d done the right thing.</p><p>\u201cI hate this house!\u201d Annette sobbed as he set her down. \u201cI hate this house. It\u2019s evil. It\u2019s evil, evil, evil. And now, I\u2019m going to die in it. Oh, no. Oh, my God! I\u2019m going to become one of the ghosts of the Tarleton-Dandridge House!\u201d</p><p>Jason knelt down beside her. \u201cAnnette, come on! The house isn\u2019t evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to see it again. I hate it!\u201d</p><p>Tyler could hear the sirens; the emergency crew would arrive any minute. He stood, leaving Jason at Annette\u2019s side and Cherry standing close by, the glass of water in her hand.</p><p>He looked around. Ethan Oxford, his complexion gray, was right behind him.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t see Allison.</p><p>Or Nathan Pierson.</p><p>\u201cLogan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Allison?\u201d</p><p>Logan, too, looked around. \u201cI\u2019ll take the upstairs,\u201d he said urgently.</p><p>\u201cNathan?\u201d Tyler turned to Ethan. \u201cWhere is he? Where did Nathan go?\u201d</p><p>Ethan shook his head, looking old and defeated. \u201cI...I was watching Annette,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tyler raced to the front, letting the emergency crew in. They came from their vehicle with \u201cpoison control\u201d bags in their hands.</p><p>\u201cBack there,\u201d he said briefly. He ran outside, but there was nothing to see. He pulled out his phone and called Jenson at the local station, telling him to get some officers out, that the area had to be searched immediately. They needed an emergency canvas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He rushed back in, grabbing Oxford by the shoulders. \u201cNathan Pierson. Did he drive here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Annette said weakly. \u201cYes, he drove.\u201d</p> <p>Walking toward the hallway, Logan pulled out his phone again and asked Jenson for an alert on Pierson\u2019s car. He ran out the front door again, anxious to see if Nathan was trying to wrest Allison into his car.</p><p>But as he raced out, he felt something\u2014someone\u2014behind him.</p><p>He turned.</p><p>It was Lucy Tarleton. And she beckoned Tyler to the back of the house.</p><p>Allison was perfectly aware of where she was and what was happening.</p> <p>She was in the apartment above the stables, stretched out on the floor. That faint scent of oiled leather, hay and horses still remained, wafting up from below.</p><p>Nathan Pierson was kneeling beside her. He looked amused\u2014and sad.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, in a few minutes, they\u2019ll come searching for you. They\u2019ll check the crypt, because they\u2019ll be sure that you were spirited away to die on top of Lucy\u2019s tomb. That would be poetic justice, but...I don\u2019t want them finding me. They won\u2019t think of anything as simple as the stables. What\u2019s that you say?\u201d He laughed, knowing very well that she couldn\u2019t answer him. \u201cThey\u2019ll search for you everywhere? Yes, they will! Everyone loves you. In fact, I\u2019ve actually been in love with you for years. You knew that, didn\u2019t you? A love-hate relationship, I\u2019d guess you could say. Keeping alive the image of Lucy as a true heroine and not a slut hasn\u2019t been easy. Still, what a sweet, bright young woman you proved to be. Of course, I\u2019ve watched you. I suspected you had to be a descendent, but we had historic records and that baby of Lucy\u2019s was so quickly swept away from all danger that your family remained above reproach. Oh, dear girl! For many years, you were like a beauty on a pedestal that I admired from afar. You loved the house and you told the stories dutifully. And what a scholar! Brains and beauty, Ally. Brains and beauty.\u201d</p><p>She would have answered him\u2014if she\u2019d been able to. She could see him; her eyes could move but it seemed that her body was incapable of obeying her brain.</p><p>Why? she wanted to ask him.</p><p>\u201cAh, why, you ask?\u201d he said, smoothing back her hair.</p> <p>He was thoughtful for a moment. \u201cI never wanted to kill you, but since you\u2019ve ruined everything, it seems only right that I explain. I am an American, Lucy. I am a patriot. I grew up going to every reenactment. Now, there are idiots who claim Washington was just a man and Lincoln had his faults. They like to talk about the way the founding fathers owned slaves and fought with one another. We have to stop that kind of talk, Allison. At the Tarleton-Dandridge House, we were true patriots. Lucy was a real heroine\u2014along with her sister, her brother-in-law and the man who should have been her husband, Stewart Douglas. But you\u2014and some of those others\u2014wanted to ruin the image. Don\u2019t go thinking I\u2019m crazy. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m a patriot. A true patriot. All those years ago, that kid. That stupid, stupid kid! He wanted to break in to steal the portrait of Beast Bradley. We need that portrait. It shows the truth\u2014that the British were our enemies. They stole our freedoms and they wanted to kill us. Tobias Dandridge painted that portrait because that was the man who came to destroy his life.\u201d</p><p>Allison was able to swallow and work her mouth. She tried to dampen her tongue; the effort was nearly useless but she discovered she could croak out words.</p><p>\u201cTobias. Tobias Dandridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Pierson demanded. He smiled. \u201cThe drug\u2019s wearing off. I didn\u2019t give you enough. Oh, it\u2019s not going to kill you. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to stab you to death. Like poor Lucy Tarleton. That\u2019s true poetic justice.\u201d</p><p>She was glad she couldn\u2019t feel anything. Despite everyone\u2019s determination that she not be alone, she was alone. With a man who meant to slice her to ribbons. And she could hardly blink. She tried to fight the terror. She needed courage.</p><p>To do what? Die when she couldn\u2019t move?</p><p>Courage wasn\u2019t about not being afraid. Courage was being terrified, and going forth despite the fear.</p><p>She struggled. She could move her lips. \u201cTobias,\u201d she whispered. \u201cTobias Dandridge was the one who murdered Lucy. That\u2019s what you\u2019re afraid I was going to figure out. We\u2019ve had it wrong for years. Lucy gave the baby away to hide from Tobias. She was afraid. The British were leaving and she knew it. Bradley couldn\u2019t take her with him\u2014and she wouldn\u2019t have gone. She was in love with him, but she really was a patriot. You do her a tremendous disservice, hiding the truth. She was in love with Bradley, but she still carried information to the patriot troops. Dandridge killed her\u2014and convinced her father that Bradley had done it. And he painted the portrait so the world would believe it, believe that Bradley was a monster. He also killed Lucy because it meant Sophia would inherit the house and everything Angus Tarleton possessed\u2014and he was going to marry Sophia. But Sophia suspected the truth, and that was why the other painting was kept in Lucy\u2019s bedroom. I imagine she hid that painting while he was alive. Sophia believed Lucy\u2019s spirit deserved a righteous image of the man she had loved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a theory,\u201d Nathan said irritably. \u201cThe same as any other.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised that he could hear her, since she could barely form the words. He leaned close to her\u2014so close. \u201cBut I believe it\u2019s the truth,\u201d she told him. \u201cAnd others might believe it, too. I\u2019m living proof that Lucy had a child. And if she\u2019d had her supposed patriot lover\u2019s child, the baby would have been loved and cherished\u2014even if she\u2019d been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have written that filth!\u201d Nathan said.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>He paused for a minute. \u201cListen.\u201d He raised his head. \u201cListen. The sirens are blazing in the night. They\u2019re going to save Annette. But they can\u2019t save you because they don\u2019t know you\u2019re here. They think I\u2019ve kidnapped you and taken you somewhere, and they\u2019ll comb the city. But you\u2019re here. I know this house, I know everything about it. I know how to slip in and around it, how to hide in it. They\u2019ll be searching the city and they\u2019ll think of the graveyard, but never the stables. This is so fitting, you see. Down there\u2014in the stall below us\u2014is where Lucy kept Firewalker, and where she came when she was about to ride out to the patriot camp. This is where she came when she was still loyal. And, Allison, it\u2019s where you\u2019ll die. You\u2019ll die\u2014like Lucy. You\u2019re talking nicely now, but you can\u2019t scream. I\u2019m going to make sure you can\u2019t scream. I really am sorry. I\u2019m going to spill your blood on this property. It\u2019s so fitting,\u201d he said again. He started to reach into his pocket and she knew he had the needle there, ready to shove into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will happen when I\u2019m dead? They won\u2019t stop until they find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFoolish girl, I\u2019ve been getting rid of those who were disloyal for years. I will get away with all of it. I\u2019ve spent the past days\u2014when I wasn\u2019t silencing a few people\u2014at my bankers\u2019. My money is now in foreign accounts. You can\u2019t imagine the number of countries that don\u2019t honor extradition to the United States. I\u2019ll lie low for a few years, and then all will be fine. Don\u2019t worry about me, my dear. So nice of you to think of me at a time like this, though. I do appreciate your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you kill Julian?\u201d she asked. Her fingers almost moved. \u201cAnd why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Julian! That\u2019s easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI left the house, walked back in right behind him and returned to the office and then down the servants\u2019 stairs. I have a very special copy of that painting of Bradley. I\u2019d switched the paintings during the middle of the board meeting. I had a copy of the original done ages ago and a magician in San Francisco did a little altering for me. Seriously, if any of you had come in on me, what would you have said about a board member adjusting a painting?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cOld Angela\u2014I tested it on her three years ago and...well, what can I say? It worked. But Julian, that narcissist! He was so busy posing in the chair he didn\u2019t hear me\u2014not until I had the painting \u2018speak\u2019 to him. He never saw me. I was behind the chair by the bookcases. He was so involved with himself that he never heard me, even when I pushed his head down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t see you or hear you. But why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was afraid of what he\u2019d learned reading your so-called research. I couldn\u2019t trust him. And I didn\u2019t like the way he acted around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nathan Pierson had the needle out. \u201cWe can\u2019t chat here any longer. I\u2019m sorry to do this to you and sorry you can\u2019t scream. I believe Lucy screamed when she was executed for her disloyalty to the cause she claimed to love. But I can\u2019t have you heard up at the house. Think about it. All that commotion inside\u2014and here you are, dying...bleeding out in the stables and they\u2019ll hate themselves, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey see you, Nathan,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWho sees me? We\u2019re alone. They\u2019ll rush to the tomb. Then they\u2019ll decide I took you off the property. By the time they run around like ants you\u2019ll be dead and I\u2019ll be long gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy sees you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy is a ghost story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy is a ghost\u2014not a story. She\u2019s watching you now.\u201d</p><p>She made him turn; he dropped the needle and had to reach down to get it.</p><p>Then Allison saw that Lucy really was there. She\u2019d slipped into the doorway, and Tyler was behind her.</p><p>He was ready, she thought. He had his Glock out as he walked into the room.</p><p>Nathan Pierson heard him at just that moment. He rose, drawing Allison\u2019s body against his. She flopped in his arms, twitching in an attempt to regain some motion.</p><p>\u201cLet her go, Nathan,\u201d Tyler said calmly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take a shot,\u201d Nathan told him. \u201cYou could shoot Allison. Shoot her and kill her, and her death would be your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy isn\u2019t going to let that happen,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLucy! There is no damned ghost! What the hell is the matter with you people? Ghost busters, it\u2019s a joke.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot true. Lucy is here\u2014and Julian is, too. I\u2019m sure he hates you even more than Lucy does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no ghosts!\u201d Pierson shouted. \u201cNow you...you back up and let me leave with her or I swear I\u2019ll plunge this needle straight into her heart. It\u2019s filled with a Norcuron mix\u2014I stole it from the hospital. In her heart? It\u2019ll kill her in a flash.\u201d</p><p>Allison reminded herself that courage was about being terrified\u2014and going forth anyway!</p><p>She managed to open her mouth.</p><p>She had one chance and she knew it. She prayed that her drugged muscles would work.</p> <p>She bit Nathan Pierson. Bit him as hard as she could.</p><p>He screamed. She was nearly dead weight.</p><p>He didn\u2019t drop her, but it was enough. Tyler used those split seconds to speed across the room, leaping over the trunks in his way, and tackle Nathan Pierson, bringing the three of them down to the ground. Pierson fought him desperately, reaching for the needle. But Tyler smashed his arm and grabbed the syringe and the two of them rolled, crashing into the wardrobe against the far wall.</p><p>Allison couldn\u2019t see what was happening. She willed herself to turn. Inch by inch...</p><p>By half inch.</p><p>She made it just in time to see the needle rise into the air.</p> <p>And she saw Tyler lift his arm, slam Pierson\u2019s arm against Angus\u2019s old wardrobe\u2014and send the needle flying.</p><p>With a right swing he caught Nathan Pierson in the jaw.</p><p>That was when Pierson gave up the fight. Tyler scrambled to his feet, racing over to Allison.</p><p>For a moment, as Tyler took her in his arms, she saw Pierson lying on the floor, Lucy Tarleton standing above him.</p><p>Her ghostly form kicked him. She saw then that Julian had come forward to do the same thing, kicking him and kicking him. Whether Nathan felt it or not, she couldn\u2019t say. But he must have sensed their hatred.</p><p>Lucy Tarleton set a hand on Julian\u2019s arm. He turned to her, and their eyes met, and Lucy smiled at him, taking his hand.</p><p>Tyler picked Allison up and wordlessly began to walk down the stairs that brought them to the first level of the stables, where the horse stalls remained.</p><p>Logan burst through with Sean, and they dragged Nathan Pierson to his feet and read him his rights.</p> <p>Cherry was standing outside the stall. \u201cThe bastard!\u201d she cried. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve any rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d he said to Cherry, holding Allison in his arms. \u201cThey might figure out what it means to be a patriot\u2014an American. Those men fought and died for our rights. So did Lucy Tarleton. But he forgot all about freedom of speech and freedom of the press\u2014and our freedom to know the truth and learn from the truth.\u201d</p><p>Tyler walked with Allison, taking her outside beneath the moonlight shimmering over the property. She wished she could put her arms around him. She knew she was headed for a waiting ambulance, but she wanted to say something to him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what. Thank you...thank you for my life. Thank you for being you, for believing...for finding me.</p><p>He carried her into the ambulance and laid her down on the stretcher.</p><p>He smiled, then took her hand and kissed it. \u201cTrue courage, my dear patriot!\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI think I love you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cA true patriot, a remarkable woman, the woman I love\u2014and a ball-breaker with wicked teeth! I could never, ever want anything more.\u201d</p><p>Once arrested, Nathan Pierson wasn\u2019t going down alone. He talked; he bargained. He played crazy and tried to pretend he\u2019d been seduced and coerced into his actions.</p><p>When Allison was released from the hospital the next morning, Tyler told her the sad truth and they went to Annette\u2019s room together. She was still being dramatic, still pushing the nurses around.</p><p>Tyler let Jenson cuff her to the hospital bed. \u201cAnnette Fanning, you are under arrest...\u201d</p><p>He went on to chronicle her crimes. Nathan Pierson had done the most damage, but Annette had put the copperhead in Sarah Vining\u2019s car and she\u2019d been the one to steal the Norcuron mix from the hospital, where her cousin had really had a baby. She\u2019d also allowed herself to be bitten by the small copperhead she\u2019d smuggled into the bathroom, in order to give Nathan a chance to get Allison out of the house. They\u2019d taken a lot of risks, but they\u2019d almost pulled it off.</p><p>Annette could also solve one of the biggest mysteries in the case\u2014Artie Dixon\u2019s coma. They would have known eventually when all the blood tests had been completed. Dixon had been a victim of argot poisoning; Annette had gotten it into his food when he and his family had gone to the Colonial tavern for dinner. She sometimes worked there, and it had been easy to mill around with her fellow workers in the kitchen. She\u2019d never seen the Dixon family, and they had never seen her. But Pierson had described them to Annette, asking her to do something that would get the family talking about the ghosts in the house, specifically Brian Bradley. If others talked about the ghosts, it would only make Julian Mitchell\u2019s suicide\u2014or accidental death\u2014appear to be the work of the evil Beast Bradley\u2019s spirit, ever residing there.</p><p>They hadn\u2019t expected the coma. That had been an added benefit.</p><p>Annette was proud of her own brilliance. Her reward?</p><p>\u201cMoney. Lots of it,\u201d she said, and turned away with one word. \u201cAttorney!\u201d</p><p>Allison was deeply depressed and hurt by her friend\u2019s betrayal, but while Annette screamed that every person couldn\u2019t be her\u2014with degrees, able to work anywhere, do anything\u2014she walked quietly out of the room. She looked as if she\u2019d break down, except that Logan was waiting for them outside.</p><p>\u201cArtie Dixon has come out of his coma. He wants to thank you. He says you\u2019ve spent hours and hours with him, trying to convince him that everything would be all right.\u201d</p><p>So she didn\u2019t break down. They visited with the Dixon family, and Todd kept taking Allison\u2019s hands and telling her she was the best, the coolest, the most wonderful.</p><p>She looked at Tyler and smiled. She\u2019d been there with Artie, yes. But not for hours and hours as he\u2019d claimed. She and Tyler both had a feeling that Lucy Tarleton had found Dixon and stayed by him, eager to help a man who needed help\u2014a family man.</p><p>She promised Todd they\u2019d stay in touch. Haley Dixon hugged Allison and kissed Tyler on the cheek, and they left behind a very happy family.</p><p>A search of Nathan Pierson\u2019s house produced the trick painting he\u2019d exchanged for the historical image of Beast Bradley in the study. It was fitted with empty eye sockets that could be lit up with blinding lasers, and tiny speakers that could be wirelessly attached to a small, voice-altering mechanism Pierson had used to terrify his victims or lure them into danger\u2014Julian to his doom with his own bayonet, and Martin Standish out to the woods and the stream beyond.</p><p>That night, Allison ordered flowers and had them brought to the Tarleton tomb. Tyler joined her there. When she\u2019d set them all around the family mausoleum, they walked back to the house.</p><p>The spirit of Lucy Tarleton was just coming from the stables. She led Firewalker, and the dog, Robert, pranced joyously at her side.</p><p>Lucy paused, staring at Tyler and Allison, and then she smiled. She lifted her fingers to her lips and blew them a kiss.</p><p>Tyler hadn\u2019t realized that Julian was with them. He saw Lucy beckon, and Julian walked over to her.</p><p>She leaped up on Firewalker, and then reached down a hand to Julian.</p><p>He looked back at Tyler and Allison.</p><p>Allison said, \u201cJulian, go. A beautiful woman is trying to take you with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely, they need rock stars wherever she\u2019s going,\u201d Tyler said.</p><p>Julian grinned. He took Lucy\u2019s hand and jumped up on the massive steed behind her.</p><p>The sun was setting. They rode toward the burst of gold in the west.</p><p>Robert barked with excitement as he followed the riders, who disappeared into the light.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re at peace.\u201d Tyler spoke in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cThank God!\u201d Allison said fervently.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd out of here\u2014for the night, at least. I know this glorious, modern, five-star hotel in D.C. where docents get special rates. They have these wonderful Jacuzzis in every room, and a lovely old bar with cushioned seats in front of a charming fireplace.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019ll do\u2014for tonight.\u201d</p><p>She studied his eyes. \u201cFor tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about a warm beach with white sand. All the huts have every modern amenity. It\u2019s my turn for a vacation. Of course, when you want to work and write, they have Wi-Fi. When you don\u2019t...they have pristine private coves, snorkeling, diving\u2014and no ghosts. Nope, no ghosts. The place I\u2019m thinking of is in Jamaica, and it\u2019s brand-new. I don\u2019t want to stay there forever, but I was thinking of a week.\u201d</p><p>She kept staring at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you in?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then...well, it\u2019s not that hard to get to Philly, not really. Unless the Krewe\u2019s across the country, I can get here easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to,\u201d she said.</p><p>His heart thundered. He tried not to show it, and held his head at a stoic Texas angle.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, stood on her toes and kissed his lips with a very seductive and insinuating passion.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to make it to that hotel,\u201d he murmured huskily. He gently pushed her away. \u201cBack to the question. Why won\u2019t I have to come to Philly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Virginia and the D.C. area are full of colleges...and I\u2019ll be just fine in Arlington,\u201d she said.</p><p>He kissed her. It was a wet, steamy kiss that made her tremble against him. \u201cI told you I thought I loved you,\u201d she teased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cNo thinking about it, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said. \u201cI know I love you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and leaned against him.
